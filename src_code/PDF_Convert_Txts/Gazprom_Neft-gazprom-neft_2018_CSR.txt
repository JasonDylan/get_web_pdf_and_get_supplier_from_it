ABOUT THE REPORT
Dear readers,
We are delighted to present Gazprom Neft’s Sustainability 
Report1 for 2018. This is the Company’s 11th non-financial 
public report, in which it describes its approaches 
to complying with the principles of corporate social 
responsibility, its contribution to sustainable social and 
economic development, and its environmental initiatives.

about PJSC Gazprom Neft as well 
as its subsidiaries and controlled entities 
(referred to in this Report as Gazprom 
Neft or the Company) for the calendar 
year of 20182. The Company’s financial 
and operating performance is presented 
based on PJSC Gazprom Neft's consolidated 
data. Unless otherwise specified, the data 
on the Company’s labour relations, social 
initiatives and environmental performance 
relates to PJSC Gazprom Neft as well as its

and progress towards achieving economic 
efficiency, ensuring occupational 
and environmental safety, supporting

In preparing the report, the Company 
relied on the GRI Standards (Core option) 
and ISO 26000:2010 (Guidance on social

The Report contains forward-looking 
statements on the Company's mid-

MESSAGE FROM 
THE CHAIRMAN OF 
THE MANAGEMENT BOARD
DEAR FRIENDS!
At Gazprom Neft, we remain committed 
to sustainable development principles. 
Financial and operating results 
are not the only measure of our success. 
We place a key emphasis on environmental 
protection and the responsible use of natural 
resources, safety, technological innovation, 
and consistent improvement of living 
standards across our footprint. A special 
focus area for us is employee engagement 
in the sustainable development of Gazprom 
Neft. We want all our people to understand 
and share the Company’s values and feel 
involved in achieving common goals.
The reporting year saw Gazprom Neft’s Board 
of Directors approve the new 2030 development 
strategy seeking to transform the Company 
into an industry champion in safety, 
efficiency, and technology-driven production. 
Underpinned by sustainability, corporate social 
responsibility and environmental protection 
principles, our new strategy sets ambitious 
goals for the Company. We are prepared 
to respond to the key challenge faced by every 
oil producer, which is to meet growing energy 
demand in the safest, most eco-friendly 
and efficient way possible using cutting-edge 
technologies.
We keep moving towards our Goal Zero: no 
harm to people, environment and property 
in working process. In 2018, we embarked 
on the transformation of our HSE system 
based on a risk-focused approach. As 
part of it, we identify key HSE risks, set up 
relevant barriers, verify them and take steps 
to ensure their reliability. Another focus 
area is the promotion of corporate safety 
culture. Last year, our HSE training 
programme covered 26,000 Gazprom Neft's 
and over 13,000 contractors’ employees.
All these measures contribute to a continuous 
reduction in injury rates, which fell 
21% in the reporting year.
We made considerable progress in ensuring 
environmental safety of our operations. Gazprom 
Neft supports the Paris Agreement on Climate 
Change and the Russian Government’s concept 
for creating a greenhouse gas emissions 
monitoring and measurement system. As part of refinery upgrades, we keep implementing our major environmental initiatives, 
including the construction of Biosfera innovative bio-treatment facilities at Omsk 
Refinery. We also expand our biodiversity preservation, water management, land 
and vegetation protection programmes. Special attention is paid to preserving 
the unique nature of the Arctic where we are running several large-scale investment 
projects. Our initiatives in the Arctic revolve around the zero-waste principle, which 
helps fully eliminate the risk of industrial and domestic waste contaminating 
the environment. To construct buildings at fields beyond the Arctic Circle, 
we leverage technologies that prevent the thawing of unique permafrost soils. We 
also arrange for deer crossings when routing pipelines.
A major employer, investor and taxpayer in the regions of its operation, Gazprom 
Neft contributes a lot to local development. We supply quality petroleum products, 
including bitumen and lubricants, under regional import substitution programmes. 
On the other side, we support local manufacturers, universities and technology 
companies by providing solid and sustainable demand for their products 
and services. Our social investment programme called Home Towns plays a key role 
in improving living standards across our footprint. Overall, it saw the implementation 
of over 250 projects to develop urban environment, social infrastructure, sports, 
education, culture and creative potential across many Russian regions. Gazprom 
Neft's corporate volunteer movement is gaining traction, with over 4,700 employees 
having joined its ranks. These are social enthusiasts seeking to make the world 
a better place to live in.
Our people are truly the key asset to the Company as they drive its future growth 
and sustainable development. Today, we can say with confidence that Gazprom 
Neft has one of the best teams in the industry and in Russia. We deservedly won 
the international Randstad Award 2018 as the most attractive employer among 
Russian fuel and energy companies and were named No. 2 Employer of Choice 
in Russia. We make sure all our employees enjoy their job, while also encouraging 
their proactive behaviour and desire to develop themselves and the Company. 
To this effect, we have put in place a system of financial and non-financial 
incentives, social support and employee training. Our Corporate University offers 
over 2,500 courses, and we plan to expand its curriculum going forward.
We view sustainable development as the backbone of our business that will help 
create long-term value for the Company and its shareholders. Always striving 
for new achievements, we will keep working hard to make a significant contribution 
to environmental protection and social improvement.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Exploration and production 
The Company relies on state-of-the-art 
technologies and a balanced investment 
policy to effectively replace its resource 
base. This is key to further growth despite 
the volatile oil prices, changing tax 
environment and the deteriorating structure 
of remaining commercial reserves across 
its conventional oil production clusters. 
Expansion of the Group’s resource base 
in 2018 was supported by the improved 
exploration and production drilling technology 
and introduction of advanced non-seismic 
exploration techniques. 
Reserves of the Company 
are audited in line with PRMS standards 
and more conservative SEC5 standards. 
Based on the Independent Reserves 
Assessment Report prepared by DeGolyer 
and MacNaughton, as at 31 December 2018, 
its aggregate proven and probable reserves 
(including the Company’s share in subsidiaries’ 
reserves accounted for by the equity method)

to 254.45 ktoe (up 3.5%). 
The strongest drivers behind production 
growth were the Company’s largest 
projects: Prirazlomnoye, Novoportovskoye 
and Vostochno-Messoyakhskoye fields. 
The Company continues forming a strong 
cluster in the Arctic to secure its oil and gas 
potential for the future. The plan for 2019 
is to start development in the northern part 
of the Novoportovskoye field.
“We are a different company today, 
whether measured by reserves and 
production or by the complexity 
of the projects we deliver. To make 
another step forward, our business 
processes should evolve.
We want to become a global leader in

it happen, we need to change too.”

(special coverage 
by Russia 24 TV Channel) were 2,841 mtoe, excluding NIS reserves. In 
2018, reserves increased 2.2% y-o-y. Gazprom 
Neft’s ratio of proven reserves to production 
(PRMS classification) is 17 years. The ratio 
of hydrocarbons produced in 2018 to new 
reserves (including new acquisitions) is 165%. 
Gazprom Neft’s largest discovery of the year 
was a new field in the Sea of Okhotsk (off 
the shore of the Sakhalin Island). Named 
Triton, the new deposit has geological reserves 
of more than 137 mtoe. Gazprom Neft 
continues exploration of offshore Sakhalin, 
and reserves in the region may increase. The 
Company tapped into four new exploration 
areas (Yamal, Orenburg Region, Khanty-Mansi 
Autonomous Area – Yugra, and north-eastern 
Gydan) while also gaining access to 21 licence 
blocks.
The Company strengthens its leadership 
in hydrocarbon production both in Russia 
and globally focusing on high-impact

Following the completion of upgrades 
and capital repairs at the Russian refineries 
of the Group in 2017, the volume of oil 
refined in 2018 increased by 7.0%. In 2018, 
the Company continued implementing 
the second phase of its environmental 
compliance and technology upgrade 
programme. It pursues strategic goals in oil 
refining and aims to increase oil conversion 
to 99% by 2025.
The year 2018 saw a sizeable growth 
in the output of light petroleum products 
(gasolines, diesel fuel, jet fuel and naphta). 
A 14% increase in bitumen production was 
associated with rising domestic demand

Neptune’s son. Triton contains ultralight oil 
with no impurities located at low depths. 
The field was discovered in the Bautinsky 
formation at the Ayashsky licence block. 
First production is expected in 2028–2030. 
The Neptune field discovered there a year before has 415.8 mt of oil reserves according to 
an updated estimate. Gazprom Neft continues 
exploration offshore Sakhalin, with the 
possibility of increasing reserves in the region. 
The Triton discovery was a major expected 
development both for Gazprom Neft and other 
companies operating in the region. Triton is 
located in an area where no prospecting has 
been done before. Gazprom Neft’s success may 
mean that new discoveries are possible. Gazprom Neft opens 
second field in 
Ayashsky block
“The ongoing operational efficiency improvement at refineries is 
a meaningful effect of the programme to upgrade refining capacities. 
When the second stage of the programme is completed, Omsk and 
Moscow refineries will additionally enhance the conversion rate and 
increase the yield of light petroleum products while reducing their 
environmental footprint.”

Sales of oil and petroleum products
Gazprom Neft is a wholesaler 
of oil and petroleum products both in Russia 
and abroad. Small wholesale and retail sales, 
including sales at filling stations, are managed 
by dedicated subsidiaries.
OIL SALES
In 2018, crude oil sales decreased 8.6% year-
on-year to 24.26 mt as production increased 
at Russian refineries of the Company.
Domestic sales dropped 22.6% to 4.31 mt, 
and total oil exports decreased 6% to 18.70 
mt. By contrast, oil sales to global markets 
rose 17.9% to 1.25 mt on the back of increased 
production in Iraq.In 2018, Gazprom Neft's own fleet received 
enough vessels to ensure uninterrupted 
service of the Company's fields in the Arctic 
region. With the fully-fledged own Arctic fleet, 
Gazprom Neft ensures year-round oil delivery 
to global markets with maximum cost efficiency 
and minimal risk of interruptions caused 
by external negative factors. 
PETROLEUM PRODUCT SALES
The growth of sales in 2018 was mostly 
associated with demand in the domestic 
market where petroleum product sales 
increased 6.1%.  
Cumulative exports of petroleum products 
and international sales grew 4.6% to 16.24 mt 
in 2018. The biggest driver of exports was 
growing sales of naphtha, fuel oil and jet fuel 
to non-CIS countries. In 2018, actual sales 
of fuel oil on the domestic and international 
markets were driven by cost considerations 
and deemed optimal given the existing demand 
and price levels.13.72 16.61 22.71 26.53 24.26

Arctic fleet is essential for the Company's projects in 
the Arctic region. Efficient logistics is key to continuous year-
round transportation of crude oil from the Arctic fields.
In 2018, Gazprom Neft's own Arctic fleet was joined by 
Alexander Sannikov, a high-tech icebreaker built at the 
Vyborg shipyard (Leningrad Region). The vessel is named 
after Alexander Sannikov, an ex-head of Gazprom Neft Oil 
Refining Division, who supervised large-scale projects of 
the Company. 
In August, Alexander Sannikov started escorting tankers in 
the Gulf of Ob from the Arctic Gates terminal to the storage 
tanker moored in the Kola Bay. In December, the fleet 
was joined by the second icebreaker named after Russian 
hydrographer, geodesist and polar explorer Andrey 
Vilkitsky. The two icebreakers are some of the most advanced 
vessels in their class. They are highly maneuverable and 
need just 60 seconds to make a 360-degree turn. Capacity 
of their propulsion units is comparable to those of nuclear 
icebreakers and allows them to move through up to 2 m 
thick ice. 
The icebreakers are equipped with state-of-the-art 
automatic power supply and navigation systems. Their 
electronic equipment can be controlled remotely. 
The vessels are designed around the zero-waste principle: 
all ship-generated waste is either recycled or stored until 
the ship returns to the port.High-tech icebreakersTechnology

Formation, in order to offset naturally declining production 
at conventional fields. This strategic project aims 
to create a technology stack to develop the Bazhenov 
Formation. It is considered to be of national importance 
for the Russian Government and the industry. In 2018, 
Gazprom Neft put into operation high-tech wells producing 
at high initial rates. This testifies that multi-frac can 
make a real difference for the Bazhenov Formation. Frac 
modelling for the Bazhenov Formation was performed 
using a unique simulator developed in cooperation with Gazprom Neft develops chemical 
solutions for enhanced oil recovery 
at depleted fields in Western 
Siberia. This becomes especially 
important as mature fields dominate 
the Company’s asset portfolio. A pilot 
project for alkaline-surfactantpolymer 
(ASP) flooding was completed 
at the Zapadno-Salymskoye field in 2018.

SUBSTITUTION
A larger procurement share of Russia-made products is on the list 
of Gazprom Neft’s priorities. To deliver on this goal, the Company 
is making use of existing solutions while also supporting the drive 
to innovate. 
1 For more details, see the Regional Policy and Development of Local Communities section of this Report.Gazprom Neft’s Department of Technological 
Partnerships and Import Substitution 
is specifically tasked to monitor the Russian 
market of goods and materials for import 
substitution on a regular basis. The Company’s 
import substitution programme translates 
into industrial strategies and roadmaps 
for alternative substitution. We also 
promote import substitution when it comes 
to our regional development programmes1.
In the past five years, the Company has 
conducted more than 120 tests on the newest 
Russia-made equipment and created some 
50 unique products to replace imported 
ones, along with another 170 products being 
developed. In addition, Gazprom Neft supported 
Russian development companies’ applications 
for external financing amounting to more than 
₽ 6 bn, including subsidies from the Industrial 
Development Fund.
In 2018, Gazprom Neft expanded its 
procurements with more than 15 new products 
never before made in Russia. The Company 
entered into strategic partnership agreements 
with Roscosmos, Severstal, Geoenergomash 
and Becema, Neftegazavtomatika, and signed 
an agreement with Lukoil and Tatneft 
for the cooperation in developing oilfield 
services based on import-substituting 
equipment and technologies with a focus 
on high-tech drilling services. Joint working 
groups with Gazprombank and HMS Group 
keep working.Gazprom Neft partners with leading R&D 
institutions to develop and productionise 
import-substituting products on an ongoing 
basis. Some of these products include:
 >low-viscosity base oils for drilling muds 
(branded as Gazpromneft Drilline);
 >new ultrahard materials for drill bit blades 
created in collaboration with the Skolkovo 
Institute of Science and Technology;
 >new version of a cracking catalyst 
with an active matrix, which provides 
benefits compared to Western catalysts 
based on an inert matrix. This was 
a joint development with the Institute 
for Hydrocarbon Processing Technologies 
of the RAS Siberian branch.
Going forward, the import substitution 
programme will help the Company and its 
partners create in Russia more than 100 new 
high-tech products. These will include drilling 
units, equipment and reagents for hydraulic 
fracturing, power generation, compression 
and downhole equipment, marine engineering 
solutions, equipment for offshore projects, 
personal protective equipment, and much 
more.50

CASE STUDY: IMPORT SUBSTITUTION
Gazprom Neft partners with leading R&D 
institutions to develop and productionise 
import-substituting products on an ongoing 
basis. 
The Gazpromneft Catalytic Systems subsidiary 
is set up as part of the Gazprom Neft Group 
to develop an import-substituting catalyst 
business. Its key objective is to construct 
a plant in Omsk to produce cutting-edge oil 
refining catalysts and develop the catalytic 
business. 
In 2018, the Omsk-based Institute 
for Hydrocarbon Processing Technologies 
of the RAS Siberian branch joined efforts 
with Omsk Refinery to develop a new cracking 
catalyst modification1. What makes it unique 
is its matrix2. The new catalyst based 
on an active matrix is superior to Western 
catalysts based on an inert matrix.
During 2018, Omsk Refinery was migrating 
its catalytic crackers from the prior catalyst 
to the new one, which proved to be highly 
effective. It will be a first choice catalyst 
to produce high-quality motor fuels. It 
also won Gazprom’s award in research 
and development. 
This cracking catalyst modification 
is supposed to be competing with imported 
catalysts, being on a par with them but much 
cheaper in production due to lower pressure 
and temperature. In 2018, the Skolkovo Institute 
of Science and Technology digitally 
modelled the existence of new ultrahard 
materials, following which the RAS Institute 
for High-Pressure Physics confirmed 
their feasibility. Physical and mechanical 
tests proved the predicted specifications. 
The Scientific and Research Centre filed 
patent applications for Russian certification 
with the Federal Institute for Industrial 
Property and for international PCT 
certification. In 2019, the Company started 
developing a technology to manufacture drill 
bit blades based on new materials and looking 
for industrial partners to produce the same. 
These materials are likely to have other 
industrial applications, too. Import substitution

1  Catalytic cracking is a technique to process petroleum fractions with a catalytic converter (a compound that accelerates chemical reactions) into high-octane gasoline and other products.
2  Matrix is a porous carrier with an active agent which helps maintain catalyst performance in a high-temperature environment. The matrix can be either inert, which allows entry for 
feedstock molecules and removal of cracking products, or active. The latter is used to precrack larger feedstock molecules.PRODUCT  
QUALITY ASSURANCE
The Company is continuously working to maintain and improve product quality and 
control reliability. The major document defining Gazprom Neft’s principles in this area is 
the Quality Policy aimed at driving efficiency in production and sales of high quality products 
compliant with Russian and international standards and regulations, and meeting customer 
requirements. 
Heads of production and sales subsidiaries 
are responsible for implementing the policy 
and fulfilling quality-related obligations.
To meet the policy goals, the Company runs 
programmes focused on:
 >product quality improvement; 
 >operational excellence;
 >comprehensive automation of production 
processes;
 >improvement of technologies and process 
flows; 
 >enhancement of environmental 
and industrial safety; 
 >development of production and sales 
infrastructure; 
 >professional training of personnel.
The Company introduced quality management 
at all corporate levels, with an integrated 
ISO 9001-compliant quality management 
system in place at Gazprom Neft’s 
production and sales subsidiaries. 2018 saw 
the system surveillance audits at Moscow 
and Omsk refineries, and ISO recertification 
at Gazpromneft Marine Bunker, Gazpromneft-
Shipping, all Gazprom Neft's major polymer 
modified bitumen facilities, including bitumen 
units of Moscow and Omsk refineries, 
production site of Slavneft-YANOS, and Ryazan 
Bitumen Binders Plant.The system is subject to assessment using 
internal and external independent audits, 
comprehensive customer satisfaction surveys, 
review of customer and counterparty feedback, 
and industry benchmarking.
Internal and external audits held in 2018 
deemed the quality management system to be 
effective and efficient.
QUALITY CONTROL
The Company exercises an ongoing control 
of feedstock and petroleum product quality 
at all stages of production and sales. 
The Company’s refineries have testing

At filling stations, mobile or stationary laboratories run additional tests 
of the fuel's physical and chemical parameters at least once a month. At 
Gazpromneft-Aero's warehouses, aviation fuel goes through several levels 
of quality control as part of its reception, storage, preparation and feeding 
for aircraft fuelling. The R&D centre of Gazpromneft Bitumen Materials performs 
additional tests of bitumen product quality, while an integrated optimised planning 
system helps ensure reliable and smooth deliveries.
The Company's products are assessed for their safety for people and the environment 
and recognised as compliant with Russian and international standards and regulations 
(including the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and Russian 
GOSTs). Their qualitative characteristics meet international standards like API, ACEA, 
ILSAC, DIN, and ISO 8217.
All regulated products (motor gasoline, jet, diesel and bunker fuel, fuel oil, 
asphalt cement) have declarations of conformity to the EAEU's technical 
regulations. Each product batch is checked for compliance with environmental 
safety requirements, with bunker fuels also regulated by in-house standards 
of the organisation (STO) and deemed compliant with ISO 8217.
CUSTOMER RELATIONS
Gazprom Neft builds direct and long-term relations with its customers by fostering 
an open and mutually respectful dialogue, providing timely and reliable 
information about products and services, and streamlining query and claim 
management. The Company continuously monitors customer satisfaction 
with product and service quality, studies key needs and offers tailored service. 
The Company uses a wide range of communication channels to educate various 
customer groups (retail, corporate and wholesale).
Each product batch is furnished with quality and safety data sheets 
and a certificate of compliance with standardisation procedures or the EAEU's technical regulations. Standardisation 
documents or amendments thereto are subject 
to mandatory approval by the customer. 
Exported products come with REACH-
compliant safety data sheets (SDS), while 
those sold domestically have an SDS 
conforming to the applicable Russian laws.
Products that are sold domestically 
have safety data sheets conforming 
to the applicable Russian laws. All 
of the Company’s petroleum products 
are categorised by hazard class specified 
in shipping documents (standardisation 
documents and safety data sheets compliant 
with the Globally Harmonised System 
of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals 
(GHS)).  
For lubricants, the Company developed 
88 safety data sheets and revised 
some 125 in line with Regulation (EC) 
No. 1907/2006 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 18 December 2006 
concerning the registration, evaluation, 
authorisation and restriction of chemicals 
(REACH). In 2018, the Company also drafted 
and registered GOST R 52056-2003-compliant 
safety data sheets for polymer modified 
asphalt cements and an SDS for a soil 
reinforcement admixture.
Russia's 100 Best Goods
Gazprom Neft’s motor fuels and oils won a quality seal at the Russia's 
100 Best Products nationwide contest. The gold winners included 
G-Drive 100 high-octane gasoline, RMD-80, bunker fuel with enhanced 
environmental features and automotive propane produced at Omsk 
Refinery, as well as Gazprom Neft oil for gasoline engines produced at 
Gazpromneft-Lubricants.the required improvements. In addition, 
the Company regularly assesses end consumer 
satisfaction at all stages of servicing.
The key indicator of Gazprom Neft customers' 
loyalty, the NPS index, remained flat in 2018 
vs 2017 (adjusted for the price) and stood 
at 59 points. This speaks to high customer loyalty 
and their willingness to recommend Gazprom 
Neft’s filling stations. In order to expand its 
customer base and increase loyalty, the Company 
organised seven nationwide and regional 
advertising campaigns in 2018. Marketing events 
organised by the Company covered 5.3 million 
retail customers. In 2018, the Company also held 
10 dedicated marketing campaigns covering 
over 2.6 million customers. 
In the reporting year, Gazprom Neft launched 
AZS.GO, a mobile application designed 
to facilitate fuel sales and payments at its filling 
stations. Developed in-house, the mobile app 
helps customers to make an order by entering 
the number of litres or an amount of money 
and pay for fuel without leaving the car 
with a linked bank card or via ApplePay. It also 
searches for gas stations by location and fuel 
price. Using the app reduces the fuelling time 
1.5–2 times. Today, 400 Gazprom Neft stations 
are already connected to this mobile service. 
Another application, Gazprom Neft Filling Station 
Network, offers a number of other services, 
such as insurance, vehicle inspection, repair, 
and motor mechanic's advice. Over 160 thousand 
users visit the Services section of the app every 
month. In 2018, the number of Gazprom Neft 
mobile app users reached 1.85 million. Gazprom Neft filling stations enjoy 
the strongest demand
Gazprom Neft retail network was the most popular among Russian drivers, 
according to Romir’s 2018 survey in 21 regions.
40% of the respondents named Gazprom Neft filling stations as the most 
frequently visited due to the availability of petroleum products, fuel price 
and quality, serviceable equipment, convenient location and working hours, 
as well as a wide offering of non-oil products and services. For 93% of the 
interviewed, the key factor was the fuel quality, with G-Drive cited as the 
best known and the most frequently purchased branded motor fuel by 37% 
of car owners. The Company's retail network ranked first in terms of brand 
recognition (39% of respondents).Corporate and wholesale customer relations
The Company communicates product quality information to corporate and wholesale 
customers through:
 >information and technical support of supplies;
 >direct dialogue between the Company’s management and customers at training 
courses and workshops for business partners and consumers, meetings 
and awareness sessions with representatives of regions’ industry ministries;
 >disclosures on corporate websites and external online resources;
 >marketing and promotion events;
 >loyalty programmes;
 >package branding.
To foster relations with corporate and wholesale customers and assess quality 
satisfaction, the Company uses various feedback tools and engages in polling, 
collecting and analysing queries, conducting surveys and focus groups, creating joint 
working groups, and running joint tests of petroleum products’ quality. 
At Moscow Refinery, the quality of saleable products met the expectations of end 
users, with no grounded complaints filed. At Gazpromneft Bitumen Materials, 
the customer loyalty review measured the respective index at 78.2, up 1.6 points 
compared to 2016, when the first measurement was carried out. In the reporting year, 
the customer satisfaction index at Gazpromneft-Lubricants went up to 3.23 points vs 
3.08 in 2017. 
Retail customer relations
To ensure a prompt response to customer queries, the Company put in place 
a single support centre operating 24/7 and leveraging various traditional and digital 
communication tools.
All queries are sorted by type and subject, registered and processed in a shared 
system. Throughout the month, the Company monitors the quality of customer

Russia and abroad.Our mission
To evolve and keep the world evolving. 
To create and feel proud of the result.
We help build resources for the future 
and make a sustainable difference 
by providing energy, knowledge, 
and technologies.STRATEGY 2030
In 2018, Gazprom Neft’s Board of Directors approved a new Strategy 
through 2030 for the Company to become a global benchmark in efficiency, 
safety and technology-driven production. 
More than a decade of strong progress has earned Gazprom Neft a spot among 
major players in the global oil and gas industry. We are firmly on track to deliver 
on targets set out in our 2025 Strategy as we complete the key projects that 
are mostly underway. 
At the same time, high volatility in energy markets, fiercer and ever changing 
competition, and transformation in the energy industry at large all create new 
challenges to oil and gas businesses. Combined with the new scale of business 
and role of Gazprom Neft in the industry, this brought about the need to revise 
and update our strategy.
Что главное в новой стратегии?
“We want to be a next generation company that sets the standards 
for Russian and global players. To deliver on this goal, we need 
to drastically transform our entire management system: by 
reviewing its digital model, operations, organisation, and corporate 
culture. We are aware of our aims, the changes we need to go 
through, and the tools we need to employ.”

Activities of the Board of Directors
MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
The General Meeting of Shareholders 
is the supreme governance body responsible 
for dealing with the most significant aspects 
of the Company’s activities.
The Board of Directors is responsible 
for the Company’s strategic management, 
defining key principles and approaches 
of risk management and internal controls, 
and exercising control over Gazprom Neft’s 
executive bodies. The Company’s executive 
bodies – the Management Board and the CEO – 
are held accountable to the General Meeting 
of Shareholders and the Board of Directors. 
Out of 13 Board members, ten are non-
executive directors (representing the majority 
shareholder), two are independent directors 
and one is the Company's executive director. 
The independence criteria used by Gazprom 
Neft are based on recommendations 
of the Corporate Governance Code 
of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation 
(Bank of Russia).
All directors have a balanced set 
of qualifications required for their roles. They 
possess skills in strategic management, 
corporate governance, corporate finance 
and risk management and have industry 
experience and expertise. 
The directors perform their duties in close 
collaboration with the Company’s management 
team, business units, registrar and auditors. 
The current composition of the Board 
of Directors ensures sufficient independence 
from the Company’s management and enables 
effective control over its performance.
The Company’s majority shareholder 
is PJSC Gazprom, which owns 95.68% 
of its capital. The remaining ordinary 
shares are held by minority shareholders 
represented by both individuals and legal 
entities, which helps strike the right balance GENERAL MEETING

DIRECTORS
in distribution of powers between those 
involved in corporate relations. Given 
the structure of the Company's share capital, 
the vast majority of Gazprom Neft’s directors 
are elected upon the recommendation 
of PJSC Gazprom, the owner of the controlling 
stake. 
Directors are elected in a transparent manner 
providing shareholders with sufficient 
information on candidates to get a clear 
idea of their personal and professional 
skills. Shareholders can use a range 
of communication channels, including hotline 
and email, to communicate their opinions 
and questions to the Board of Directors. On 
top of that, they have an opportunity to put 
questions to the Company’s executive bodies 
and directors before and during the Annual 
General Meeting.Board of Directors composition by age46 47

REPORT 
2018GAZPROM NEFT
In 2018, the Board of Directors reviewed 
the following sustainability-related matters:
 >the Company’s Development Strategy until 
2030 and advancing certain lines of business;
 >international expansion plans;
 >Gazprom Neft’s programme for the Russian 
offshore projects;
 >performance against the investment 
programme in 2018;
 >further innovations at the Company;
 >the Company’s efforts to embrace domestic 
products and solutions and increase 
their share in its purchases;
 >KPIs and their impact on the Company’s 
efficiency; >assessment of performance of Gazprom 
Neft’s external auditor for 2017;
 >results of assessing and reviewing the main 
risks after 2017; 
 >implementation of key environmental 
protection initiatives in 2017 and plans 
for 2018;
 >programme for APG utilisation 
and its improved use in 2018 and plans 
for 2019–2021;
 >changes in APG utilisation levels 
in the Orenburg Region in 2015–2018.
Assessment of the Board of Directors' 
performance
The Board's annual performance assessment 
is held in the form of survey (polling). 
The questionnaire contains around 30 questions 
covering the main areas of activity. The results 
reflect the status quo of the key processes, 
such as strategy, business practices, 
efficiency management, support of the Board 
and its committees, and personal contributions 
of directors, including the Chairman 
and the Secretary. 
In 2018, the Human Resources 
and Compensation Committee approved new 
criteria to assess performance of the Board 
of Directors and deemed it advisable to engage an independent service provider for the Board's 
review at least once in three years.
The reporting year’s assessment revealed 
improvements in setting strategic 
priorities and interactions with top 
executives, as well as better performance 
and a more balanced composition 
of the Board's committees. At the same 
time, more efforts are needed to enhance 
the quality and timeliness of information 
provided to the Board and develop 
channels for improving communication 
with the management team and other 
stakeholders.
The Company maintains the balance between 
shareholders’ and managers’ interests. 
Its majority shareholder has enough 
votes to appoint the Board of Directors 
and resolve on a variety of matters falling 
within the remit of the General Meeting 
of Shareholders. Nonetheless, the Company 
implements a range of measures to decrease Corporate CodeTo raise the directors’ 
awareness of 
the Company’s 
sustainable 
development 
activities, Gazprom 
Neft now adds 
responsible 
investment matters 
to the Board 
of Directors’ annual 
agenda. 
Measures to prevent conflicts of interest
risks related to governance where most 
of the share capital is held by a single 
shareholder.
In resolving conflicts of interest, we rely 
on our by-laws – the Corporate Code 
of Conduct and the Corporate Governance 
Code. Gazprom Neft has established the Corporate 
Culture and Ethics Working Committee 
to ensure compliance with the Company’s 
Code. This committee is made up 
of Management Board members.
The Corporate Governance Code requires 
the directors to:
 >refrain from any actions that may result 
in a conflict of interest;
 >abstain from voting on matters where they 
have a personal interest;
 >refrain from disclosing or using 
for personal or third-party gain any 
confidential and/or insider information 
about the Company.
In 2018, an Extraordinary General Meeting 
of Shareholders approved a new version 
of the Regulation on the Board of Directors 
of Gazprom Neft. Now, it has a section on identification and prevention of conflicts 
of interest on the Board of Directors 
specifying procedures to avoid the same, 
including:
 >mandatory notification of such conflicts;
 >the inclusion of information on a conflict 
in the materials provided at a meeting;
 >the right to suggest that the director 
involved in the conflict not be present 
at the discussion;
 >prohibited use of any direct or indirect 
benefits offered by persons promoting 
their interests in the decision making.
Information on directors’ involvement 
with other companies is verified on a quarterly 
basis. In 2018, members of Gazprom Neft’s 
Board of Directors and Management Board 
had no conflicts of interest.
Remuneration of the Board of Directors  
and the Management Board
The Company has put in place a remuneration 
scheme for the Management Board 
and senior management that is used 
to calculate bonuses for meeting short-
term targets and a long-term incentive 
programme that rewards the Company's 
managers for increased stock prices in each 
of its three-year periods. Remuneration 
payable to the Board of Directors 
is linked to the Company's financial 
results and is subject to annual approval 
by the shareholders. The discretionary control 
by shareholders is necessary to prevent 
potential abuse of the remuneration process. 
In 2018, the General Meeting of Shareholders 
resolved to allocate and pay 0.005% of EBITDA 
to the non-executive directors. 
In addition to the base remuneration, 
the directors received additional payments 
for chairing the Board of Directors 
and its committees and membership 
in the Board's committees (50%, 50% and 10% of remuneration payable to directors, 
respectively).
Total remuneration paid to the Board 
of Directors in 2018 amounted to ₽ 366.39 
m, inclusive of personal income tax. The 
Company did not reimburse directors 
for expenses related to discharging 
their duties.
The members of the Management Board 
are entitled to the base remuneration 
as specified in their respective employment 
contracts, as well as annual bonuses 
and LTIP payments.48 49

MANAGEMENT  
SYSTEM
The Company's Strategy 2030 views the development of the Etalon Operations Management 
System (OMS) as a key element of the Company’s transformation. Etalon’s roll-out kicked off 
in 2016. The system prototype is now being pilot tested at a number of our assets and is ready 
to be scaled across the Company. 
The OMS is a structured set of interlinked 
practices, procedures and processes used 
by managers and employees at each level 
of the Company as part of its operations. 
Compliance with the OMS requirements 
is a must at all levels and across all units, 
from offices and laboratories to drilling rigs 
and factories.
The key objective of the roll-out is to ensure 
continuous improvement of the Company’s 
operational efficiency.
This will be achieved by introducing universally 
standardised practices and having all 
employees embrace the culture of continuous 
improvement based on:
 >uniform management processes across 
the Company;
 >uniform safety and reliability standards;
 >employee involvement into decision making 
and generating ideas;
 >clearing all sources of losses;
 >implementing regular management 
practices and lean production.
The system’s framework is described 
in the OMS Code, which brings together 
Company-wide requirements to equipment safety, reliability and integrity, process flow 
efficiency and staff expertise. 
The OMS comprises 12 functional elements 
grouped into three major blocks: operational 
culture, operational reliability and safety, 
and operational efficiency.
1. Facilitative leadership is at the core 
of the first block, i.e. operational culture. It 
is a style of leadership effective in creating 
a supportive environment for employees 
to work towards the Company’s strategic 
goals.
2. The second block covers operational 
reliability and is based on uniform asset 
reliability criteria and requirements, 
uniform safety management processes 
and measures to minimise the number 
of faults and failures.
3. The third block is built around 
operational efficiency with a focus 
on the operating assets’ ability to know 
and see their potential, leverage the tools 
necessary to cut all and any losses, 
and support a culture of continuous 
improvement.2018 RESULTS

A key principle of Gazprom Neft’s corporate governance is information 
transparency. Gazprom Neft accurately and promptly informs its 
stakeholders about significant events and aspects of its operations.

ETHICS AND ANTI-CORRUPTION 
PRACTICES
Gazprom Neft has zero tolerance for potential corruption 
and fraud risks. With this in mind, the Company joined 
the Anti-Corruption Charter of the Russian Business 
adopted by the RSPP.
The Company’s framework regulation 
in this area is the Anti-Fraud and Anti-
Corruption Policy, which contains the main 
requirements to business processes in order 
to mitigate corruption risks, and sets forth anti-
corruption rules and standards for employees. 
Knowing the policy and complying with its 
key principles are mandatory for all Gazprom 
Neft’s employees.
The Company runs an anti-fraud and anti-
corruption training programme compulsory 
for all employees, both new and old. To 
control corruption risks when cooperating 
with external counterparties, Gazprom Neft’s 
CEO approved standard anti-corruption clauses 
to be included in agreements with third parties 
(both Russian and foreign ones). 
At Gazprom Neft, Deputy CEO for Security 
is in charge of anti-corruption activities.
The Company's anti-corruption measures at all 
internal control levels include:
 >reviewing and updating fraud and corruption 
risks classified as key corporate risks;
 >applying the due diligence principle 
to potential counterparties, and including 
relevant obligations (anti-corruption 
clauses) in agreements;
1 The applicable legislation puts law enforcement authorities in charge of verifying the cases  of corruption. This means they must be notified in the event of suspected corruption. 
The Company’s review of hotline reports identified no need to involve law enforcement authorities in 2018. >checking new and old employees

and maintain high ethical standards at all 
business levels; allocate powers and duties 
among and assign responsibilities to the heads 
of business units with respect to effective 
development, implementation, maintenance, 
monitoring and improvement of the Company’s 
internal controls; and regularly assess 
staff performance and training as regards 
internal controls taking into account changes 
in the Company’s internal and external 
operating environment. Heads of units and employees of the Company 
act so as to develop, document, implement, 
execute, monitor (carry out self-assessment) 
and improve control procedures within 
their competence and remit, as well as timely 
inform their immediate superiors of instances 
where control procedures become impossible 
to execute and/or need to be amended 
due to changes in the Company’s internal 
and external operating environment.
The Company’s Audit Commission ensures 
the accuracy of financial statements and other 
information on the Company’s financial 
and business operations and financial position.RISK MANAGEMENT
Gazprom Neft has a Risk Management Policy in place, which sets out the objectives 
and principles of risk management to enhance stability of the Company's operations 
in the short and long term. 
Our risk management strategy seeks to improve managerial decision 
making by analysing the related risks, and to maximise the effectiveness 
of the management initiatives when these decisions are brought to life. 
To this end, the Company has a unified approach to the risk management 
process. Along with uniform analysis and risk management tools, it forms 
an integrated risk management framework (IRMF).
As part of this framework, risk management tools are integrated into all 
key corporate processes. Responsibility for risk management and reporting 
is determined by the linear and functional management framework. For each risk, 
an owner responsible for managing it is assigned. Each function and key business 
process has a risk coordinator among the management staff. They are responsible 
for promoting and supporting the application of corporate risk management principles. The timing and objectives for risk 
analysis depend on the particular circumstances 
and requirements of each business process 
with respect to which risk management 
is implemented.
This approach helps define areas 
of responsibility for risk management 
and monitor risks at all management levels 
across the Company. It also allows Gazprom 
Neft to develop target plans to respond 
to material risks for each subsidiary 
and the Company at large.

Risk description Risk mitigants
1.1. HR risks
Highly qualified personnel is key to effective operation 
of the Company's business. A lack of qualified employees, especially 
engineering and technology experts, can result in risks associated 
with personnel shortages. The Company's success largely depends 
on the efforts and expertise of key employees, including qualified 
engineering staff, and on its ability to attract and retain such 
personnel. Competition for the best talent in Russia and world-
wide may intensify due to the shortage of qualified specialists 
in the labour market. Failure to attract qualified employees and/or 
retain the existing talent pool could have an adverse effect on 
the Company's reputation as an employer. Demand for qualified 
personnel and the associated costs are expected to grow further given 
the significant need for such employees in other industries. The Company offers a safe workplace environment, competitive salaries, 
and professional training programmes to its personnel. We work 
continuously to improve our recruitment procedures, limit staff turnover, 
and provide self-development opportunities for our employees.
1.2. HSE risks
Risks associated with occupational industrial, fire and environmental 
safety legislation that may entail a temporary shutdown of facilities 
and licence revocation, along with the risks of accidents (fatalities 
and workplace injuries, fires/explosions/accidents, accidents with 
environmental consequences of nationwide scale).In the field of industrial safety, the Company strives to achieve 
the strategic Goal Zero: no harm to people, environment and property 
in working process. The main focus areas reflected in the corporate 
HSE Policy Statement include:
 >safe production based on risk analysis, mitigation 
and management;
 >reduction of workplace injury and occupational disease rates, 
accident hazards and environmental impact;
 >consistent implementation of best global HSE practices.
The risk-based approach and the principle of integrating HSE risks into 
all key business processes of the Company underlie the occupational 
risk management ideology. 
As part of the implementation of a risk-based approach, the Company 
focuses on the following parameters. 
 >Fundamental barrier  
Setting obstacles for priority risks across the Company’s assets 
and ensuring their reliability.
 >Competency barrier  
Granting access to processes to competent employees only
 >Digital barrier management  
Eliminating the human factor where possible.
The Company is fully aware of its responsibility to preserve 
the environment. We keep monitoring our activities for compliance with 
relevant environmental requirements and run environmental protection 
programmes.

CORPORATE CULTURE
The backbone of Gazprom Neft’s corporate culture is its values. 
The aims and growth areas of the corporate culture are shaped 
by the Company’s strategy and challenges in the oil industry. 
In 2018, as part of the Company’s overall transformation towards the 2030 
Strategy, Gazprom Neft launched a major programme to overhaul its corporate 
culture. The key aim is transition from hierarchical management to facilitative 
leadership as a new relationship ideology. The Company’s Management Board 
approved the updated corporate values.
This cultural transformation is designed to foster behaviour conducive 
to the Company’s strategic objectives. A crucial part of the project is creating 
a new incentive system that covers a variety of corporate aspects: management 
by objectives, promotion, salary review, personnel rotation and development. 
The key role in the new corporate culture is played by a leader relying 
on corporate values. To this end, Gazprom Neft has developed a new profile 
of leadership competencies. Under this model, a leader:
 >thinks big, reviews challenges and issues from a variety of angles;
 >manages priorities and time effectively and has the ability to focus on what 
matters most;
 >motivates others, fosters an environment where they want to excel, 
recognises the importance of every team member, and appreciates 
their contribution;
 >keeps on learning, and acts as a role model for continuous improvement.Continuous improvement that underpins 
leadership competencies will be the basis 
for developing new and updating existing 
corporate training programmes.
Cultural transformation is supported 
by a large-scale communications campaign 
and a programme for in-person and online 
training that targets different audiences. 
The training programme is developed 
by leaders as change agents (heads 
of subsidiaries) and ambassadors for change 
(heads of HR) depending on the current 
situation and corporate culture on site. 
This enables building training programmes 
that are tailored to each specific facility.

took part in a study 
of the Company’s staff 
morale In 2018, Gazprom Neft held a major 
communications campaign to promote its 
new mission and reviewed model of corporate 
values among employees. The focus was 
on communications between Gazprom Neft’s 
top executives and rank-and-file employees. 
A strategic session of the Company’s 
management, attended by CEO Alexander 
Dyukov, was broadcast live to announce 
the start of the programme to develop corporate 
culture and identify the role of all levels 
of managers in building the target behaviour. 
The campaign involved all existing channels 
of internal communications and also relied 
on new marketing forms and channels, 
including interior design of office spaces 
and production facilities, branding for office 
stationery, etc. A major part of the campaign 
was a contest of stories told directly 
by employees, who shared their insights 
on how corporate values help in their everyday 
work and enable them to make the right 
decisions, especially tough ones.Following the communications campaign, 
53% of employees of the Corporate Centre 
identified the new corporate values 
correctly. The level of employee awareness 
with respect to corporate values was 
21 pp higher compared to 2017. A new 
stage in the communications campaign 
will be promoting employee behaviour aligned 
with the new values.
In 2018, the Company held an annual study 
of its staff morale among employees 
of the Corporate Centre, 58 subsidiaries, 
and seven contractors, covering a total 
of ca. 27,000 people. The study involved 
a survey followed by randomised focus 
groups. The resulting reports for each site 
will serve as a platform to further foster 
corporate culture and improve staff morale 
in teams. Action plans focusing on employee 
engagement are the basis of all internal 
communications.

The Company seeks to attract, engage, 
and retain the best available employees. 
Gazprom Neft has developed a distinctive 
employer value proposition that 
is based on the demands and expectations 
of the target audience and takes into 
account the Company's strategic objectives 
and competitive position in the industry. 
The value proposition is integrated into 
the management recruitment, onboarding 
and training processes. According to a survey 
conducted in 2018, over 75% of employees 
approve and support Gazprom Neft's value 
proposition and would readily recommend 
the Company as a good employer. 
In 2018, Gazprom Neft’s status as one 
of the country’s leading employers was Employer brand
confirmed by the high scores in Russian 
and international rankings. Gazprom 
Neft came out on top of the international 
Randstad Award ranking leading the charge 
in the energy sector. Moreover, the Company 
was named No. 2 Best Employer and No. 1 
Employer of Choice by HeadHunter in 2018, 
while also taking second place as the Most 
Attractive Employer for students majoring 
in engineering and natural sciences and third 
place as the Most Attractive Employer 
for students pursuing degrees in business 
and commerce in the Universum Top 100 
Russia 2018 rating. To top it off, Gazprom 
Neft was the only oil company in the Top 15 
employers most sought by IT students.
"Gazprom Neft's leading position among Russian employers demonstrates not only 
jobseekers’ traditional interest in the oil and gas industry, but also the Company’s ability 
to provide its employees with more than just decent working conditions and compensation. 
We offer exciting jobs and a wide range of opportunities to grow professionally while working 
on promising projects, and expect a strong talent pool to boost our technological leadership 
in the industry.”

1 Full-time employees only (no records of part-time employees are kept).
2 For more details on HR management, including personnel costs, professional training figures by category, etc., see Appendix  1  
(Additional information and sustainable development metrics).In the reporting year, Gazprom Neft had 
70,600 employees1, with blue-collar 
and white-collar workers making up 47% 
and 53% of the total headcount, respectively. 
16,808 employees joined the Company 
and 15,205 people left. The average headcount 
was up 4.1% y-o-y driven by stronger labour 
demand caused by changes in the production 
assets’ operational programmes, growing 
output, and the expanding operating range 
of the subsidiary service providers.
In 2018, the turnover rate was 12.9%, down 
2.2 pp y-o-y. To get a better understanding 
of the causes of attrition at subsidiaries, 
the Company is introducing a new tool – 
Robot Vera, an automated interview service 
for the outgoing staff. The service allows 
making calls to virtually all employees leaving 
the Company. Monthly analysis of the actual 
reasons behind resignations and ensuing 
remedial actions helped reduce the turnover 
rate in the regions with the highest personnel 
loss ratios by 5% y-o-y. 
Gazprom Neft has a job placement programme 
for employees of the projects/facilities that 
are scheduled for shutdown. Some 6–8 months 
prior to the shutdown of a facility, project, 
or a development site, the Company forms 
a cross-functional team and develops a job 
placement plan to be implemented by the Head 
of Organisational Development and HR 
Management. Under this plan, the Company 
makes up a list of potential vacancies within 
the corporate structure, informs employees 
about such vacancies, and arranges personal 
sessions for employees to talk to the managers 
of business units offering the potential job 
placement. 2018 headcount

The Company runs non-financial incentive 
programmes, updating their contents 
and formats in line with its strategic goals. 
One of the key programmes involves individual 
and team competitions of professional skills, 
held across the Company's divisions. 
The competition programme is updated 
on an ongoing basis to cover new areas 
of expertise and most relevant competencies, 
with the number of participants, regions, 
and countries involved constantly growing.
250 employees from 13 subsidiaries, including 
foreign operations, participated in the 10th 
International Best in Profession Contest 
of the Upstream Division, with winners 
invited to take part in the nationwide stage 
of the Best in Profession Contest. 
In 2018, the Best in Profession Contest 
of the Downstream Division underwent 
transformation from an in-house corporate 
event to an industry-wide competition 
attracting participants from all subsidiaries 
of the Division, NIS (Naftna Industrija Srbije 
А.D., Novi Sad), Rosneft, TANECO, SIBUR, 
SLAVNEFT, and Gazprom neftekhim Salavat. 
For the first time in the Contest's history, the competition in the Chemistry Lab 
Technician category was held under the rules 
of WorldSkills, an international championship 
of vocational skills.
When selecting candidates for participation 
in the 10th anniversary edition of the Contest, 
the Regional Sales Directorate reviewed 
not only contestants’ expertise, but also 
their performance indicators and managerial 
skills. This year, the Contest tried out a new 
format, with the second day dedicated 
to socialisation, experience exchanges 
and introduction to the latest technologies 
implemented or developed by the Company. 
The Company's key non-financial incentive 
programmes also include target programmes 
of business units intended to recognise 
strong performance. These programmes offer 
contests for corporate teams, performance-
based bonuses for production facilities, 
employees and teams, including contractors, 
Summer and Winter sports games 
for employees, and other leisure activities.
 “The Company aims to set a global benchmark against which other 
businesses will assess their performance and technical efficiency. We have 
made a clear step forward by joining the WorldSkills movement, holding 
corporate championships, and introducing our employees to international 
professional standards.”

2018GAZPROM NEFT
The Company views safety culture 
as an important tool in achieving the Goal Zero 
and seeks to make sure that its employees 
have no concerns about their safety when they 
start working on a new assignment. Gazprom 
Neft’s safety training system plays a pivotal 
role in the Company’s corporate safety culture. 
The training process is all-encompassing 
and highly standardised while also being 
closely related to other elements of the safety 
management system. 
In 2018, the Company continued 
implementing its three-year targeted training 
programme launched back in 2016. As 
part of the programme, training courses 
are developed and run in the areas identified 
by the Company as priority ones for achieving 
the Goal Zero, including leadership in the field 
1 Mandatory training in line with statutory requirements.
2 Number  of employees trained in line with statutory requirements for educational and additional corporate programmes focusing on workplace safety .of workplace safety, asset reliability, risk 
assessment, interaction with contractors, 
transport safety, and development 
of the workplace safety function. In 2018, 
over 29,000 employees and 13,000 contractors 
completed dedicated training2.
In-house coaching is another key driver behind 
the Goal Zero mission. Corporate coaches 
are the Company’s employees who combine 
their main job responsibilities with mentorship 
assignments. This format has proved its 
efficiency over the years, with Gazprom Neft 
now focusing closely on the organisation 
of training sessions and coach meetings 
along with the assessment of mentorship 
competencies. 
Key safety rules
In 2017–2018, Gazprom Neft ran a large-scale information 
campaign for the employees of its subsidiaries 
and contractors focusing on the implementation of the key 
workplace safety rules. They are mandatory for all Gazprom 
Neft’s employees and contractors across the Company’s 
footprint and include 11 basic rules aimed at creating target safe behaviour of the employees, significantly reducing 
injury risks and, coupled with the best practices, bringing 
the Company closer to achieving its strategic Goal Zero 
mission. The rules were implemented not only through 
training, organising and motivation campaigns, but also 
through taking disciplinary actions against rule breakers. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018

In 2018, Gazprom Neft embarked 
on the transformation of its HSE system as part 
of a wider business transformation exercise, 
with the Company seeking to join the ranks 
of global workplace safety champions by 2030 
in line with its Development Strategy. The 
system transformation relied on a risk-based 
approach, with a series of PDCA (Plan-Do-
Check-Act) projects developed by Gazprom 
Neft for its implementation.
 >Targets: to establish priority HSE risks.
 >Safety framework: to set obstacles for risks 
including those associated with contractors.
 >Certification, inspection, investigation: 
to ensure reliability of the obstacles set.
More than 80 internal experts from across 
the Company’s units, Divisions and hierarchy 
levels were mobilised to help draft 
the HSE transformation programme. Projects 
to introduce a cyclical risk-focused approach 
are to be launched in 2019.DIGITAL BARRIER MANAGEMENT 
Eliminating human factor where applicable
“We remain committed to the Goal Zero mission as the HSE transformation 
programme is being implemented. To further reinforce the progress 
achieved, we are launching a series of security projects that will allow 
us to systematically build obstacles for unacceptable events and 
ensure that such events will not happen in the future. It is obvious that 
qualitative changes in security can only occur with developing new digital 
technologies, as well as increasing competences of the Company’s 
employees.”
Anton Gladchenko
Director of HSE Directorate
Control technologies
In 2018, the Upstream Division implemented a project that 
won the Division’s corporate security competition award. 
Gazprom Neft Orenburg has introduced an electronic control 
system that evaluates contractors’ compliance with safety 
requirements and provides information on their training, 
certification, medical check-ups and the admission of 
personnel and vehicles to work by technical control stations. In the long term, the project provides for the integration with 
the video surveillance system, larger scope of documents 
to be included into a single electronic pass, etc. As a result, 
Gazprom Neft Orenburg will have a unified database of 
contractors’ employees and vehicles. The project is planned 
to be rolled out to other subsidiaries of the Upstream 
Division.Priority areas

CONTRACTOR  
MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY
Contractors’ obligation to comply with legislative and corporate 
HSE requirements is formalised in contracts. Ensuring conformity 
with the requirements is far from being the only focus area in the Company’s 
contractor relations policies. Gazprom Neft builds partnerships and seeks 
to create an environment that would promote workplace safety and encourage 
suppliers to cooperate with the Company on a long-term basis.
Steps programme
1. Review and selection of candidates, drafting and signing of contracts 
At this preparatory stage, the contractor should assess its resources required 
to ensure health and safety, and make a binding commitment on its responsibility 
and ability to meet legislative and corporate HSE requirements. 
The Company’s long-term goal in this area is to make a clear but rigorous 
screening of contractors and to ensure transparency of the resources planned 
to deliver the required level of health and safety.
2. Work delivery. Contractor performance management 
During his stage, the contractor is engaged, contract performance 
is monitored, and equipment, machinery and employee qualifications 
are checked. At this stage, Gazprom Neft’s long-term goal is to ensure that 
no contractors are allowed to start working until they meet the requirements 
under the contract.
The Company is developing various tools to control the contractors’ activities. 
Along with the Contract Performance Management System and Owners 
of Contracts With Contractors in place, subsidiaries arrange mobilisation audits 
for contractors. With this in mind, the Company runs a corporate 
contractor engagement programme called 
Steps, which embraces every stage of supplier 
relationships, from selection to the assignment 
of final ratings, and a new initiative called 
the Contract Performance Management System.
3. Contract closure and final rating
At this stage, the Company evaluates 
contractors’ performance. Assigning ratings 
helps to compare contractors and take 
a proactive approach in dealing with those 
who fail to show improvements. The 
long-term goal in this area is to integrate 
performance indicators, including those 
associated with HSE, into the corporate 
information system, ensure transparency 
and bonus payments for contractors’ 
staff based on positive results 
of their performance. 
Steps is a set of comprehensive initiatives 
designed to improve safety culture, 
motivation and training of contractors’ staff 
as well as enhance their social and working 
conditions.Compliance with corporate safety standards is a key criterion in selecting Gazprom Neft’s 
contractors. Interaction with contractors is determined by the corporate standard Procedure 
for Management and Organisation of Interaction with Contractors on HSE Issues, which was 
updated in 2017 and sets out Gazprom Neft’s requirements applicable to contractors during 
their selection, management and performance assessment. 
The Upstream Division employs the Contract 
Performance Management System, which 
is a new model for monitoring contractors’ 
fulfilment of contractual obligations related 
to the workplace safety. Performance 
of obligations is monitored by the dedicated 
teams of the customer’s and contractor’s 
representatives who control the compliance 
with safety requirements, solve arising issues 
and ensure transparency on the site. This 
model facilitates ongoing and quick cooperation 
between the Company and the contractor. It 
shifts focus from the violations of requirements Contract Performance Management system
to act proactively, and eliminates the risk 
of biased attitude towards contractors. Joint 
teams contribute to more transparent 
and structured communication in performing 
contractual obligations. 
The introduction of Steps and the Contracts 
Performance Management System helps 
prevent and mitigate possible risks during 
the contract performance management. The 
two programmes enable Gazprom Neft to take 
another step towards building a partnership 
model of interaction with contractors.“The first step towards 
creating an integrated 
team is close cooperation 
with contractors, 
which is important 
for all production 
assets of the Company. 
Involvement 
of contractors’ 
engineering and technical 
employees not only 
in the construction 
process, but also 
in the discussion 
and development of joint 
approaches and initiatives 
designed to improve 
the production culture, 
is already starting 
to reduce the number 
of violations.”
Maksim Ovsyannikov
Head of Capital Construction 
Programmes of the Oil and Gas 
Production DepartmentContractors are included in the corporate 
HSE training system. A dedicated programme 
has been developed which is mandatory 
for managers to manage operations at Gazprom 
Neft’s facilities. Contractors’ representatives 
take part in training courses and video briefings, 
and actively participate in the School of HSE 
Supervisors. The main goal of the School 
is for supervisors to start proactive work set 
to develop a culture of safe behaviour. In 2018, 
the training in the Upstream Division covered 
over 1,000 supervisors, with contractors’ staff 
accounting for 70%.Gazprom Neft organises dedicated forums, 
sessions and meetings with contractors 
on a regular basis to share experience 
and improve performance. They are attended 
by senior executives of the Company 
and its Divisions, function leaders and heads 
of facilities. Forums and sessions empower 
the Company to deliver on its strategic objective 
of liaising with contractors, i.e. building 
partnerships, encouraging the proactive position 
of contractors, and involving them in HSE 
improvement.
Introduction of the Etalon OMS by Gazprom Neft’s 
Upstream Division started with component 6 (Supplier and 
Contractor Management) since contractors do most of 
the upstream work, including well drilling, construction, 
repairs, prospecting surveys, power supply, and logistics. 
New developments might involve up to several thousands 
of contractor employees, so the key task is to ensure 
contractor safety on the site with no compromise on performance. Experience shows that the mere inclusion of 
safety provisions into the agreement does not guarantee 
that they will be met by contractors. It was decided to set 
up joint customer and contractor teams to monitor how 
they meet contractual obligations. These teams control the 
compliance with safety requirements, solve arising issues 
and make the on-site conditions transparent. Contractor safety94 95

Asset Reliability 
Management System on 
the Company’s websiteThe Company’s key HSE priorities comprise 
continuous improvement of workplace safety 
and reduction of accident and injury rates 
and occupational diseases. The Company’s 
main professional and technology-related HSE 
risks include equipment failures and breach 
of organisation rules for high-hazard 
operations, as well as violation of regulatory 
requirements and safety rules by contractors. 
To mitigate these and other safety risks, 
the Company manages them in accordance 
with the corporate standard based 
on qualitative risk assessment. The Company 
uses advanced international methods such 
as HAZID/ENVID (hazard identification), HAZOP 
(hazard and operability study) and PHSER  
(HSE risk review) to assess technology-related 
risks during design, construction, operation 
and liquidation processes. Technology-related 
HSE risks are managed by the equipment 
reliability improvement programme. Due 
to the importance of this production area 
and HSE, it has been singled out as a separate 
OMS component. 
Reliability management is based on risk 
assessment at all stages of the production 
cycle, from design to dismantling and disposal. 
At the operational stage, the Company needs 
to ensure smooth and reliable operation 
of equipment throughout its life time 
and reduce the number of its repairs. 
To this end, the Company uses advanced 
approach and assessment tools such as RCM, 
RBI and RCA2 enabling us to rank equipment 
based on its criticality for production, focusing on highly critical facilities, to implement a failure 
analysis system that identifies and classifies its 
causes, and to effectively manage the process  
using the statistics collected.
The assessment methods of occupational 
risks in workplace safety are designed 
to make sure that employees have no concerns 
about their safety when they start working 
on a new assignment. To mitigate this group 
of risks, the Company is developing various 
occupational controls and improving its safety 
culture.
The main programmes set to foster safety 
culture and leadership in this area include 
rating to subsidiaries based on HSE criteria, 
monitoring dangerous actions and hazardous 
conditions on a dedicated observation map, 
and conducting leadership safety behaviour 
audit.
As part of rating process, the Company’s 
subsidiaries are assessed based on proactive 
(initiatives seeking to prevent accidents) 
and reactive (rates of injuries, accidents, road 
traffic accidents, etc.) criteria and are ranked 
according to the achievement of HSE targets.
Leadership safety behaviour audit 
is one of the key tools for line managers 
to control safety behaviour at the production 
facilities. This is a regular documented 
process of monitoring an employee’s work 
on an assignment and his/her work areas/
places, followed by a conversation with him/
her to correct dangerous or encourage safe 
behaviour.
3 To calculate the number of accidents in 2018, the Company used a new methodology as prescribed by Order of the Federal Environmental, Industrial and Nuclear Supervision Service 
(Rostechnadzor) No. 29 On Approval of Methodological Guidelines for Classification of Technogenic Events in the Realm of HSE Taking Place at Hazardous Oil and Gas Production Facilities 
dated 24 January 2018. In line with these new guidelines, some of the incidents previously classified as first grade technogenic events or incidents, are classified as second grade 
technogenic events and no longer regarded as incidents starting from 2018.

Responding to emergencies
To ensure civil defence, the Company enhances the emergency resilience of its 
production facilities and trains its employees to respond effectively, including 
in harsh weather conditions. 
The Company has an Emergency Prevention and Response System.  
It is focused on:
 >planning and implementing emergency prevention initiatives;
 >protecting employees and production facilities;
 >enhancing the resilience of production facilities;
 >mitigating the risk of industrial emergencies;
 >minimising property damage from emergencies;
 >using relevant action plans to recover from natural and industrial 
emergencies.
The Prirazlomnaya offshore ice-resistant stationary platform is 
a hazard class 1 production facility, which puts it in the highest 
risk category. The area occupied by this highly sophisticated 
complex is very small and risks arise when different types of 
work are performed there simultaneously. This makes the 
Company pay special attention to the platform’s safety. To this 
effect, Gazprom Neft leverages the most advanced solutions 
available. Prirazlomnaya’s safety system monitors industrial 
processes, as well as fire and gas alarm and emergency 
shutdown systems, and, in case of an incident, ensures safety 
with no need for human involvement (fail-safe mode). All 
processes are automated and backed up.
In 2013, the Company put into effect an action plan for 
oil and petrochemical spill prevention and response in 
the Prirazlomnaya platform area, which describes the most 
probable oil spill scenarios, indicates resources and 
manpower required for response, and sets forth procedures 
for interaction with professional emergency and rescue 
teams and government agencies. Following the update 
in 2018, the plan passed the state environmental review as 
required by the applicable Russian laws.
The engineering solutions to ensure safety,  also include 
walls able to withstand temperatures above 1,000°C for 
two hours, a gas and fire alarm system, a fire and explosion 
suppression system1, capable of tackling gas explosions with Prirazlomnaya – an island of safety
an inert gas (freon), and robust evacuation systems (lifeboats, 
rescue rafts, and bridge-like structures to facilitate the 
boarding process).
All wells are equipped with safety valves activated 
by the emergency shutdown system, to prevent blowout 
of formation fluids. An abnormal decrease or an increase 
in pressure detected by sensors will trigger an alarm. If 
the pressure reaches a critical level, the well pump will shut 
down and the valves, which can resist very strong pressure, 
will close to shut off the well.
The Company organises emergency response training for 
its staff. Exercises and drills take place in the Prirazlomnaya 
area on a regular basis to ensure maximum alignment of 
the response team in case of any emergency. Exercises are 
held both offshore, including in ice conditions, and onshore, 
to protect the coastlands of the Varandey settlement and 
remote islands.
In June 2018, after this plan was updated, the Company held 
a large-scale oil spill response exercise at the Prirazlomnaya 
platform and drills to protect the coastlands of the Varandey 
settlement and Dolgy Island from oil contamination.
The event featured the Company’s own personnel and 
resources, including Ecoshelf-Baltika’s professional emergency 
and rescue teams and Gazprom Avia’s aircraft, as well as oil 
spill response personnel and resources of Varandey Terminal.The Company runs an annual drill and training 
programme for employees and managers 
to practise:
 >emergency alerts;
 >officer assembly and notification 
of the municipality’s and facility’s emergency 
teams acting as part of the National 
Emergency Management System (NEMS);
 >mobilisation of emergency and rescue units;
 >safe shutdowns of industrial equipment;
 >emergency localisation;
 >using personal protective and basic fire-
fighting equipment;
 >providing assistance and aid to affected people.
1 Lower  mechanical sensitivity of explosives through addition of inert gases.Under the exercise plan, a leak from a storage tank would 
cause an oil spill into the Pechora Sea. Operating personnel, 
icebreaker fleet, and emergency equipment, both on-site and 
onshore, were mobilised for emergency and rescue operations, 
with the Pechora Sea monitored constantly using aircraft above 
Prirazlomnaya, Varandey and remote islands. Booms were 
towed to protect the coastlands. A rescue team, site camp, and 
equipment were flown to Dolgy Island. It was also the first time 
when the operations included rescuing wild birds that nest in 
coastlands.The exercise confirmed the Company’s high emergency 
preparedness, with Gazprom Neft’s emergency and 
rescue divisions joining forces with other participants and 
cooperating organisations to deliver effective response.The reporting year’s major initiatives included the following:
 >A unique training facility opened at the Omsk Refinery to provide opportunities 
for acquiring and practising work at height skills. The nine-metre-high 
three-tier complex is one of a kind in the Russian oil refining industry. It has 
12 functional zones for all types of work at height, including those involving 
the use of ladders or moving across or along horizontal or vertical metal 
structures, slopes or piperacks. 
“While the risk of emergencies is minimal thanks 
to technologies at Prirazlomnaya, we must always 
be prepared for any incident. Our key priority here is to 
safeguard the platform’s personnel and ensure that we do not 
cause any harm to the Arctic ecosystem.”

Transport safety
The specific rate of road traffic 
accidents in 2018 went down 
by 20% compared to the average 
per specific rate in 2015–2017.Gazprom Neft’s transport safety programmes include workplace control 
initiatives, defensive driving courses, safety briefings and training sessions, 
and monthly HSE meetings (stand-ups).
The Company’s project teams seek to improve safety across Gazprom Neft’s 
priority areas, which include air, water, and road transport, with dedicated 
roadmaps through 2019 in place. The project teams are responsible for drafting 
internal regulations, which set operating standards for all assets. In 2018, 
the Company drafted and approved a document that regulates workplace 
safety issues at the railway facilities and is aimed at mitigating possible risks 
and bringing the number of accidents to zero. Gazprom Neft was the first 
among oil and gas companies to develop such a document. 
Training is an important part of transport safety programmes. 
The updated road traffic safety management system launched in 2017 focuses 
on developing the ability of drivers to predict and avoid emergency situations. 
In 2018, the dedicated training sessions covered some 49,000 drivers working 
for Gazprom Neft and its contracting companies.
In the reporting year, the Upstream Division introduced 38 mobile road safety 
teams to prevent road traffic accidents, monitor drivers, oversee compliance 
with the operating rules pertaining to the road transport and special 
equipment, and examine the condition of roads and access roads. 
In 2018, the Downstream Division began piloting a vehicle tracking system 
featuring an online control system and an AVL hardware to monitor driving 
behaviour. The pilot project involves assets transporting hazardous goods. 
In 2018, Gazprom Neft’s IT team completed an R&D project focusing on using 
the video analysis to improve road transport safety at the Company’s sites. 
The researchers developed a tool based on a neural network algorithm to analyse and control driver behaviour. 
Artificial intelligence recognises violation 
of safe transportation rules by drivers, such 
as using a mobile phone, smoking in the car, 
being unbelted, or driving with third persons. 
The new system is self-learning. As soon 
as it accumulates sufficient data, it becomes 
capable of not only registering standard 
incidents, but also identifying the new ones. 
Data from the vehicle trackers 
are transferred online to the operator who 
responds to dangerous actions of drivers 
or hazardous situations in real time as well 
as generates reports on the driving quality 
for the management of the subsidiaries.
Road transport monitoring system
Since 2017, Gazprom Neft’s production assets have 
been implementing an IT-based vehicle tracking 
system to monitor the implementation of obligations 
relating to the safety of the Company’s road transport 
contractors. The system analyses information about 
drivers, vehicles, permits and licenses, reviews data from 
vehicle tracking devices and makes reports on the driving style similar to those used by large transportation 
companies, monitoring speed, sudden acceleration 
or braking. In 2018, the Company continued developing 
the tracking system, with over 7,000 contractor vehicles 
being connected to the system and additional barriers 
introduced to control the access of vehicles and drivers 
to the Company’s facilities.Health and safety 
The Company’s health protection 
and disease prevention system is  
designed to:
 >ensure health and well-being 
of the Company’s employees;
 >align an employee’s health condition 
and physical abilities with the job 
characteristics and requirements;
 >identify and eliminate workplace health 
hazards;
 >raise employees’ awareness 
about occupational health.
To achieve these goals, the Company 
undertakes to:
 >assess and minimise occupational 
disease risks;
 >ensure safe and hygienic working 
and living conditions across its field 
sites;
 >implement comprehensive prevention 
initiatives to reduce disease incidence 
among employees;
 >arrange for medical examinations;
 >identify and monitor cardiovascular 
disease risk groups;
 >prevent contagious and non-contagious 
diseases (vaccination / therapeutic 
and preventive nutrition);
 >develop an emergency medical 
response framework (first medical aid 
and evacuation capabilities, first aid 
training for employees); >promote healthy lifestyles (including vaccination, healthy living awareness 
campaigns, alcohol and drug abuse prevention initiatives, insurance 
activities);
 >investigate health-related incidents and analyse disease (disability) 
incidence.
These activities are governed by the legislation and the Occupation 
Health Programme corporate standard. To increase responsibility across 
the supply chain, the Company introduced health protection into contractor 
management. Among other things, Gazprom Neft controls medical check-
ups of contractor employees and makes sure that contractors have 
an effective emergency medical response system in place.
In 2018, the Company launched a three-year project to create a health 
protection system designed to prevent or mitigate accidents. The project 
focuses on identifying employee health risks and bottlenecks 
for implementing key medical and rehabilitation initiatives.
Protective clothing for the Arctic
Providing employees with protective clothing and personal protective 
equipment is an important component of the Company’s care about their 
health and safety. The reporting year saw the Company complete a major 
project of creating a new uniform for Prirazlomnaya employees. The new 
hi-tech clothing for offshore operations will ensure protection from 
extreme cold, wind, rain, sea salt, and open fire. It also comes in bright 
colours to enhance the safety of personnel working in the harsh Arctic 
environment. 100 101

The reporting year saw 
Gazpromneft-Khantos implement 
an automated pre-trip check-
up system. It takes the system 
90 seconds to evaluate both 
standard health indicators 
(heart rate and blood pressure) 
and psychophysiological state 
of employees to minimise the risks 
of employees reporting for duty 
in dangerous states (ill health 
or intoxication). MAIN FOCUS AREAS
1. Building barriers to prevent exposed 
employees from accessing production 
facilities. The Company has established 
uniform requirements and qualification 
standards for clinics conducting medical 
examinations to screen out dishonest 
counterparties. Gazprom Neft also started 
developing a local system of automated 
pre-tour/pre-shift medical check-ups 
which integrates medical equipment 
and software. The system allows 
for an early identification of many diseases 
and online monitoring of the employee’s 
condition to detect fatigue, sudden 
health impairment, or stress. Based 
on the results, the system can notify 
the relevant employee, dispatcher, 
and the doctor.
Award of the Russian Health  
and Safety Week
The Company’s Occupational Health System Programme for 2018–2020 
won the top prize in the nomination for Advanced Occupational Disease 
Prevention and Employee Rehabilitation Solutions of the Health and Safety 
competition held as part of the Russian Health and Safety Week 2018. 2. Building barriers to reduce injury severity 
and provide an effective emergency 
medical response. The Company 
consistently improves its resource 
allocation and trains its employees 
to provide better aid at each phase 
of response – from early identification

Moscow Refinery continued building 
the Euro+ oil refining unit that will enable 
it to decommission five small processing 
ring facilities launched back in 1960s 
and cut pollution emissions. 2018 saw 
the Company complete the construction 
of a closed cycle high-temperature gas 
disposal system for Euro+. The technology 
helps eliminate excessive process gas, if any, 
in a safe and reliable manner through its full 
incineration in a closed protected fireproof 
chamber, with a zero impact on atmosphere.
Omsk Refinery completed the construction 
of a new automatic on-spot loading 
unit for light products started 
in 2016. The new unit virtually eliminates 
the risk of hydrocarbon vapours getting 
into atmosphere from loaded products 
and increases process safety. The facility 
replaced the open tank-car loading gallery 
with a leak-proof loading rack using vapour 
condensation technology. The project brought 
to a close the transformation of the loading 
system at Omsk Refinery that ships around 
70% of petroleum products by rail.Advanced Biosphere treatment facilities 
under construction at Omsk Refinery will 
greatly improve wastewater treatment 
and cut emissions and discharges. Among 
other things, the project provides for off-gas 
treatment in cutting-edge gas convection

Underground storage for APG utilisation 
At Messoyakhaneftegaz, the Company is going to set up 
APG storage in the gas cap of a neighbouring oil and gas 
condensate field. This is an unprecedented project for the 
oil and gas industry, and to carry it out the Company will 
build a compressor station with a capacity of 1.5 bcm of gas 
per annum at the Vostochno-Messoyakhskoye field and two 
multi-well pads with nine reinjection wells at the Zapadno-
Messoyakhskoye field. The fields will be connected through 
an interfield pipeline for transporting compressed gas.
This initiative will maximise the efficiency of APG utilisation 
at Messoyakhaneftegaz. Currently, the APG accumulated 
as part of crude oil production at Messoyakha fields is used for process needs as fuel for oil heating furnaces and 
boilers. Transportation of the APG from the Vostochno-
Messoyakhskoye field and its injection into the gas cap of 
the Zapadno-Messoyakhskoye field will make it possible 
to use the stored gas in the future. This project cannot be 
implemented at the Vostochno-Messoyakhskoye field, where 
active oil production takes place, because of its geological 
structure: the field does not have deposits with properties 
and space suitable for mass storage. The Company 
is planning to build the infrastructure using Russian 
equipment. The construction is scheduled to complete in 
2.5 years. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018

of its production assets. The Board of Directors 
set a goal to reach a 95% APG utilisation rate 
at the fields with developed gas infrastructure 
by 2020, and across all of the Company’s 
assets (including the newly acquired ones) – 
by 2022.

NIS is a Serbia-based company that took active part 
in implementing the European Union’s initiative to 
incorporate an EU directive on climate into the country’s 
legislation. 
In particular, NIS participated in the meetings held between 
the Serbian government and the European Commission on 
monitoring and reporting GHG emissions. The company has 
a department responsible for monitoring the EU’s policies 
and regulations, including those in the area of climate 
change and energy efficiency.
The company’s low carbon strategy will be defined in line 
with the National Climate Strategy of Serbia, which is 
currently under development. Still, NIS is already taking 
a number of steps to monitor and reduce emissions based 
on the corporate environmental standards and goals. 
First, the company plans to assess the impact of climate change on NIS a.d. Novi Sad’s operations, determining 
the GHG management procedures in accordance with 
the EU directives and regulations and the volumes of CO2 
emissions. The next scheduled step is for NIS to work out 
the arrangements necessary for the free allocation of CO2 
emission allowances for the company’s installations that 
will be participating in the EU ETS1. The company made 
a preliminary assessment of direct CO2 emissions as well 
as drafts of monitoring plans for these installations.
NIS runs projects on APG utilisation and renewable energy 
development2. The company constructed amine3 drive for 
gas refinement in Elemir, which removes CO2 from natural 
gas. This CO2 is then transported to the Rusanda field and 
used to raise reservoir pressure and enhance oil yield. NIS 
has 17 cogeneration power stations that produce electricity 
and heat using APG.The rise in APG flaring volumes since 
2016 was attributable to new projects 
where the utilisation infrastructure 
is at the construction stage, which is almost 
completed at the Archniskaya group of fields, 
as well as the Southern block of the Priobskoye 
field and the Novoportovskoye field. The 
production growth at these fields was the main 
driver of the increase in APG flaring in 2018.In total, in 2018 the APG utilisation rate across the Company’s subsidiaries 
operating in Russia increased by 29.6% y-o-y, which was achieved thanks to:
 >Ensuring high utilisation of gas processing equipment; 
 >Maintaining high APG utilisation at the fields with developed gas infrastructure;
 >Launching commercial operation of stage 2 of the comprehensive gas 
treatment unit (CGTU) at the Novoportovskoye field run by Gazpromneft-

Water resources management
The key areas of the Company’s activities 
on water resources management include 
sustainable use, effective wastewater treatment, 
and prevention of natural water bodies 
contamination with oil and petroleum products. 
Gazprom Neft monitors water protection zones, 
surface and ground waters and evaluates 
the condition of bed sediments of the surface 
water bodies in the regions of its operation.
At the refineries, which are active water 
consumers, the quality of wastewater 
is monitored twice a day. The condition 
and level of groundwater at the borders 
of sanitary protection zones are assessed.  
The Company’s key projects in this area 
include the completion of construction 
of Biosphere biological treatment facilities 
at its Moscow Refinery and building similar 
treatment facilities at the Omsk Refinery. 
Featuring a reverse osmosis unit, the facility 
provides for multi-stage system of wastewater treatment, including mechanical, physical 
and chemical, biological, filtration, 
and ultrafiltration stages. Closed loop water 
treatment enables us to reuse in production 
up to 70% of the treated water. In 2018, as part 
of the project the Omsk Refinery prepared 
a construction site for treatment facilities 
and purchased equipment.
In 2018, the Moscow Refinery water treatment 
facilities reached their design capacity. 
As a result, the refinery cut river water 
consumption and significantly lowered 
the load at municipal treatment facilities. 
The launch of Biosphere biological treatment 
facilities at the Omsk Refinery is slated 
for 2020, with the project’s capex totalling 
₽ 18.6 bn.

OFFSHORE PROJECTS
In developing the first upstream project 
on Russia’s Arctic Shelf, the Company 
introduces the most advanced technological 
solutions to protect the environment, namely, 
marine resources. There is no direct contact 
of the well with water at the Prirazlomnaya 
platform, as the construction is installed 
on the bottom of the Pechora Sea. The wells 
that are drilled in the field are located inside 
the platform, with its foundation serving 
as a buffer between the well and the sea. 
Moreover, the equipment installed on the wells 
is designed to prevent uncontrolled gas or oil 
blowouts and, if necessary, to block the oil rise 
in 7 seconds. The oil storage facility is located 
at the base of the platform, below all other 
facilities and systems. This design solution sets out additional safety requirements to operate 
Prirazlomnaya. In order to avoid leakage 
of gaseous light hydrocarbons, the “wet” 
method of storage is used in oil storage tanks. 
In the reporting year, the Company 
eliminated contaminant discharges into 
surface water bodies through upgrading 
the storm drain at Novorosnefteservis 
and treating its wastewater 
at the treatment facilities.110 111

Waste management
Most of waste is drilling sludge 
resulting from the production process. 
Improving the efficiency of its processing 
is one of the Company’s top environmental 
priorities. The corporate concept of drilling 
waste management seeks to reduce 
the environmental risks and unify waste 
management requirements. The concept 
takes into account the infrastructure 
of the fields under development, existing 
technologies for drilling waste disposal, 
technical and economic indicators, methods 
for well construction, and waste injection into 
the formation.
The Company uses advanced drilling rigs 
equipped with a system for liquid treatment 
of drilling waste, which maximises 
the reuse of drilling mud and process 
water in production. The remaining drilling 
waste, which includes used drilling mud, 
drilling sludge and wastewater, is classified 
as hazard class 4, or low-hazard waste. Waste 
is collected in mud pits reliably protecting 
the soil and groundwater from possible 
contamination due to its waterproofing 
properties. 
The Company spares no effort 
to reduce waste generated by oil refining 
and transportation. Gazprom Neft disposes 
of legacy production waste accumulated 
at the facilities during the decades of the Soviet time. During the five years 
of work, the Moscow Refinery has eliminated 
the waste accumulated before 1991, along 
with over 180 kt of oil-containing waste, 
while releasing and rehabilitating 15 ha 
of land. Slavneft-YANOS disposed of 19 kt 
of hazardous industrial waste during nine 
years of the programme (7.6 kt in 2018) which 
is scheduled for completion by 2024.
The Company cleans areas 
not only under the corporate environmental 
programmes. Gazprom Neft’s employees 
initiate and carry out volunteer projects. 
The Company continued cleaning out Novy 
Port and Mys Kamenny villages. Gazpromneft-
Yamal’s volunteers lifted six sunken barges 
and collected 150 tonnes of scrap metal using 
bulldozers and excavators.
In St Petersburg, Gazprom Neft retail 
network jointly with the Municipal Council 
of Pesochny village and the Petrov National 
Medical Research Centre of Oncology set up 
the environmental quest called The Clean 
Games, which facilitated the collection 
of over 2.5 t of garbage in St Petersburg’s 
Kurortny District.
In 2018, the volumes of waste sent 
for disposal and neutralisation reached 
903,430 t, accounting for 86.8% of total waste 
generated throughout the year.
Green is new black
In November 2018, Gazpromneft retail network launched 
The Green is New Black environmental project to develop 
a culture for proper disposal of old car tyres. The project 
tackles the problem of unauthorised landfills of old tyres, 
which is pressing for many regions. In St Petersburg 
and Yekaterinburg, drivers could bring used tyres 
to the Company’s filling stations. Within the project,  over 7 t of tyres was collected and transferred for 
recycling into crumb rubber for coatings of playgrounds 
and athletic facilities. The crumb rubber will also be used 
for building a recreational area in the village of Pesochny 
in St Petersburg’s Kurortny District and to improve one of 
the social facilities in Yekaterinburg.903.4

MILLION TREES  
SAVEDOil production and refining are potentially 
hazardous industrial operations. However, 
ongoing monitoring of equipment reliability 
and new technologies help the Company 
minimise the risk of soil contamination 
with oil or petroleum products.
The Company is running a targeted 
programme to ensure pipeline reliability 
and the Clean Territory project, which also 
seeks to reclaim disturbed lands. Under 
the programme, 400 km of pipes is replaced 
every year.
The Company is developing diagnostic 
technologies that reduce the number 
of failures and improve the economic 
efficiency of programmes. The innovative 
methods in use include non-contact 
magnetometric diagnostics which detects 
localised corrosion by registering magnetic 
fields, as well as UAV monitoring the technical 
condition of oil pipelines.
Gazprom Neft reclaims disturbed 
and contaminated land and mud pits 
by implementing cutting-edge pipeline 
technologies and land rehabilitation 
solutions based on prevalent soil properties 
and climatic conditions. 
In 2018, the Company launched the Green 
Seismic 2.0  – project based on seismic exploration technology preserving forested 
areas. The traditional approach requires 
building wide forest clearings to allow 
the passage of heavy all-terrain vehicles, 
with the width of the receiver  lines of 4 m 
and the source lines of 4–5 m.
Green seismic survey is carried out using 
wireless recording equipment, which can 
be installed with the help of lightweight 
machinery. This enables us to significantly 
narrow down clearings or not to create them 
at all. The Green Seismic method introduced 
by the Company in 2016 reduced the width 
of the receiver lines1 to one metre. At the end 
of 2017, Gazprom Neft launched a new stage 
of the Green Seismic 2.0 project to narrow 
the width of the source lines to 1–3 m. Each 
such project saves 450,000 trees2.
The Green Seismic 2.0 project will not only 
contribute to preserving forested areas, 
but will also reduce the number of heavy 
all-terrain tracked vehicles, fuel consumption 
and emissions into the atmosphere, while 
improving industrial safety. In 2016–2018, 
the technology was rolled out at Gazpromneft-
Noyabrskneftegaz, Gazpromneft-Khantos, 
Slavneft-Megionneftegaz, and Gazpromneft-
Vostok. It saved 1,800,000 trees.The Clean

The results of Arctic 
Biodiversity Preservation 
ProgrammeBiodiversity preservation
Biodiversity preservation programmes 
are rolled out across all of the Company’s 
Russian assets. Ensuring environmental 
safety in offshore and onshore projects 
is the Company’s absolute priority. Its 
environmental initiatives aim to maintain 
the natural balance of fragile Arctic 
ecosystems and preserve the region’s 
biodiversity.
To evaluate its impact on various ecosystems, 
the Company maintains an ongoing 
environmental monitoring within its footprint. 
Some of the territories that the Company 
monitors in the Prirazlomnaya platform area 
include the coasts of Dolgy, Matveyev, Golets, 
Bolshoy Zelenets, Maly Zelenets and Vaygach 
islands. The monitoring covers surface 
seawater and sea ice, biological resources, 
bottom sediments and atmospheric air. 
The 2018 research proved that the monitored 
sea area was in normal condition, with no 
deviations identified in coastal ecosystems.
In Russia’s Arctic, Gazprom Neft runs an open-
ended biodiversity preservation programme 
using some of the animal and plant species 
that are endemic to the Arctic marine 
ecosystems as indicators of their sustainability. 
Developed jointly with the leading Russian 
and global experts, this programme seeks 
to meet the requirements of major national 
and international biodiversity preservation 
regulations, agreements and conventions.
Reproduction 
of aquatic 
bioresourcesIn 2018, Gazprom Neft launched a large-
scale programme to get insights into 
the life of narwhals, a rare Arctic species 
featuring on the IUCN Red List. Up to now, 
there has been no comprehensive research 
on this animal. This unique project will help 
study the condition of the narwhal population 
in the western sector of Russia’s Arctic Zone, 
determine the number and distribution 
of the species, and develop a conservation 
programme for narwhals and their habitat.
In the Sakhalin island area, the Company 
monitors the Sea of Okhotsk ecosystem. 
Since 2017, Gazprom Neft takes part 
in an industry-wide project aimed at monitoring 
and conserving the gray whale population. 
The population of gray whales migrating 
between the Sea of Okhotsk and southern 
Korea is one of the smallest on our planet. In 
the early 1980s, these animals nearly went 
extinct and have since been closely watched 
by environmentalists. Oil and gas companies 
take measures to reduce the negative impact 
on the gray whale population and ensure its 
conservation and replenishment.

The research conducted by the companies in the industry 
underlies the measures aimed at protecting gray whales, 
which include the use of ships with lower noise levels, 
vessel speed limits, and routes that are removed from whale 
feeding grounds. The action plan is subject to an independent 
evaluation by the Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel 
(WGWAP) established by IUCN. WGWAP consists of American, 
Canadian and Russian scientists specialising in marine 
mammals and hydroacoustics.
According to the 2018 preliminary monitoring results, 
the Company’s operations do not affect the population of gray 
whales. 
The reproduction of aquatic bioresources programme  
is a significant element of field development projects. Gazprom Neft subsidiaries operating in the Arctic 
contribute to breeding and reproduction of rare fish 
species in the northern seas and rivers. Millions of muksun 
fingerlings are released into the Ob, Konda and Severnaya 
Sosva rivers. Hundreds of thousands of captive-bred Atlantic 
salmon inhabit the waters of the Northern Fishery Basin (the 
Vyg, Suma and Keret rivers). In 2018, the Company’s facilities 
released 20 million fingerlings of commercially valuable 
fish species into the water bodies. During the same year, 
the Company signed an agreement with the Government 
of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area to expand its 
programme aimed at preserving aquatic biological resources 
and their habitat in the region. During 2018, Gazprom Neft 
also released 25,000 of young Atlantic salmon into the Keret 
River (the Republic of Karelia) that flows into the White Sea.114 115

Upstream Division 
The Upstream Division’s energy efficiency 
programme covers technical and organisational 
measures.
When it comes to technical measures, 
the key driver for improving energy efficiency 
is the production equipment upgrade. Of all 
production operations, mechanical liquid 
lifting consumes the biggest portion of energy. 
The Company optimises well performance 
by switching to short-term or intermittent 
operation and introducing energy efficient 
downhole equipment. Other technical 
improvement measures are the upgrade 
of pumps, use of energy efficient rotors 
and installation of variable-frequency drives 
in the reservoir pressure maintenance, oil 
preparation and pumping systems.
1 Starting from 2018, the perimeter of consolidated data includes Gazpromneft-Yamal, Messoyakhaneftegaz, Upstream Division of Gazprom Neft, Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegaz, 
Gazpromneft-Khantos, Gazpromneft-Vostok, Gazpromneft-Orenburg and Slavneft-Megionneftegaz. The 2017 and 2018 data include power consumption indicators of these companies. 
At Upstream Division of Gazprom Neft, power consumption in 2017 (excluding Gazpromneft-Yamal, Messoyakhaneftegaz and Slavneft-Megionneftegaz) stood at 6,064,268 MWh, while 
heat consumption amounted to 1,124,180 GJ.The Company achieved significant energy 
savings through well interventions 
to reduce the amount of produced water 
and use water injection techniques. The key 
organisational measures include energy audits 
and the implementation of an energy efficiency 
monitoring system and IT projects to support 
energy saving and energy efficiency processes.
Power consumption per tonne of produced 
liquid, the key energy efficiency metric, was 
28.39 kWh/t. 
In addition to implementing its Energy Efficiency 
Improvement Programme, the Company 
shut down low-margin wells and optimised 
the operation of oil pumping equipment 
at central gathering facilities to cut specific 
power consumption.
Equipment optimisation
2018 saw the overhaul of high-pressure multistage centrifugal ring-section pumps 
with a performance improvement of 3%. Slavneft-Megionneftegaz successfully tested 
electric submersible pump units with high-performance EC motors, with energy 
consumption at pilot wells falling by 25–30%. In 2019, the Company plans to install 
25 similar units across the Division.

Key activities under the Downstream 
Division’s Energy Saving and Energy Efficiency 
Improvement Programme in the reporting 
period include:
 >revamp of process furnaces and technical 
upgrade of boilers (enhancement of flue 
gas heat utilisation);
 >optimisation of compressor equipment 
operations and upgrade of lighting 
systems; 
 >optimisation of heat supply layouts, 
recovery of heat from production processes 
(use of thermal power from product flows 
for heating up feedstock and other process 
flows).
Energy savings under the energy saving 
and energy efficiency programme amounted 
to 3.3 PJ (petajoules) or 3,347 TJ.
Implemented as part of a large-scale 
refinery upgrade exercise launched 
by Gazprom Neft back in 2008, the Energy 
Saving and Energy Efficiency Improvement 
Programme made a significant contribution 
to the Downstream Division’s performance. Under the Programme, the Company 
builds new modern units, implements 
automated control systems and replaces 
outdated production units at the refineries. 
In 2018, economic benefits from energy 
saving initiatives at Omsk and Moscow 
refineries amounted to ₽  447.4 m, exceeding 
the initial targets by 50%. At Omsk Refinery, 
impressive results came on the back of a new 
automated system for cleaning the heating 
surfaces of furnaces at the facility for deep 
conversion of fuel oil, optimisation of process 
furnaces, and installation of higher-
performance insulation in the main steam 
pipelines. At the same time, Moscow 
Refinery saw systemic optimisation 
of furnace operation modes at the facilities 
for hydrotreatment of cat cracking gasoline, 
bitumen and hydrogen production, and oil 
distillation. On top of that, compressed air 
supply schemes at production facilities were 
optimised and the upgrade of heat and steam 
condensate equipment was completed. In 
2018, the Company implemented a total of 25 
energy saving initiatives at Omsk and Moscow 
refineries.3,347

the industrial clusters. As part of the regional 
development strategy and a project to set up 
a petrochemical cluster, the Company continued 
the construction of the oil refining catalyst 
and needle coke production plant in the Omsk 
Region in 2018. This will be the first Russian 
plant to produce needle coke, a strategic 
material for the steel-making, nuclear, chemical 
and space industries.
The Company’s Technopark in the Omsk 
Region is a unique platform that focuses 
on the development and testing of digital 
solutions for software import substitution and industrial automation. Through 
the Technopark, the largest one east 
of the Urals, the Company contributes 
to the implementation of the Digital Economy 
in Russia government programme in Omsk. 
Using the Technopark establishment, 
Gazprom Neft awards grants to support 
promising initiatives and provides the young 
developers with computer workstations 
and expert assistance. The field tests of new 
solutions are performed at Omsk Refinery 
and other facilities of the Company. In 2018, 
the Company introduced a co-working 
space for the developers where they can 
join their efforts using the Technopark 
infrastructure.REGIONAL

SOCIAL PROJECTS 
completed“Today, Home Towns is 
a community  
of those who care.”
Alexander Dybal
Deputy CEO  
for Corporate Communications
ABOUT THE PROGRAMME
We believe that support of projects spanning 
a broad spectrum of public interests can 
improve the quality of life. This is why 
our efforts target such areas as access 
to culture and sports, urban infrastructure, 
aid to young talent, and support of social 
enthusiasts’ improvement initiatives.
ABOUT PROJECTS
In 2018, the Home Town’s portfolio combined 
some large-scale national and international 
projects run annually and a variety of smaller 
local volunteer campaigns, all of which 
are vital for regional development.
ABOUT THE APPROACH
Our investments in creative and socially 
important projects set stage for a sustainable 
and comprehensive development across 
our footprint, and their positive outcomes 
encourage people to take part in new projects 
running independently of Home Towns.
When we were launching Home 
Towns in 2012, we sought to transition 
from conventional sponsorship and charity 
to a social investment format. Our experience 
shows that was the right choice. We would 
not have been able to make changes 
we see in our regions of operation without 
a massive support and engagement of local 
communities.ABOUT THE FUTURE
In 2019, Home Towns will focus on digital 
communication formats. We will increasingly 
rely on two-way communications and cutting-
edge tools to engage people in social life, 
and place a stronger emphasis on online 
education, exchange of hands-on knowledge 
and building horizontal ties. A good 
example of such interactions is the social 
investment forum where volunteers, grantees 
and programme partners can meet and share 
their experience and best practices. Today, 
Home Towns is truly a community of those 
who care.
ABOUT LEADERS
Home Towns is also a massive volunteer 
movement driven by local activists, 
programme partners and by now over 4,700 
Gazprom Neft employees. All of them 
make personal contributions to improving 
the towns where they were born and raised, 
or where they moved to work and live 
with their families.
In 2018, active volunteers, winners 
of Gazprom Neft grants, and the Company’s 
partners in key projects became the first 
ambassadors of Home Towns. Programme 
ambassadors are people with a proven social 
track record, leaders capable of building 
a creative and engaging environment 
to support further transformation. This goal 
is similar to the one that we set ourselves 
in corporate development as we seek 
to establish new leadership in business. 
Unlocking your own potential is only half 
the battle. You cannot fully succeed without 
helping others fulfil themselves to the best 
of their ability.HOME TOWNS

with a capacity of about 2,000 m³/h in Novy Port. The boiler house, 
boarding school, fish factory, hospital and kindergarten are to be

The Group’s companies that operate in the areas 
inhabited by the indigenous northern minorities 
are Gazpromneft-NNG, Gazpromneft-Yamal, 
Gazpromneft-Zapolyarye and Gazpromneft-
Khantos. They rely on the Company’s Policy 
on Interactions with Indigenous Northern, 
Siberian and Far Eastern Minorities 
as the underlying document defining 
the common approach, main principles and key 
areas of the Company’s interaction with local 
communities.
The Policy provides for the Company’s business 
strategy to be implemented with due regard 
to the need to sustain the culture and traditional 
way of life of the northern communities. 
To this effect, Gazprom Neft makes sure 
its employees and contractors are aware 
of the rules of conduct in the settlement areas 
of indigenous minorities and gives support 
to social initiatives. The basic interaction 
principles include respect of their rights, 
transparency and constructive cooperation.INTERACTION  
WITH INDIGENOUS  
NORTHERN MINORITIES
The Company ensures strict observance 
of indigenous peoples’ rights in the course 
of field development. When working 
on relevant projects, the Company and local 
authorities stage public hearings attended 
by indigenous minority representatives 
so as to take their interests into account 
in the facility construction process. The 
Company also holds regular informational 
meetings with heads of indigenous 
families and representatives of municipal 
governments.
The Group’s companies sign agreements 
with the heads of indigenous families 
or the representatives of municipal 
governments in order to support the northern 
communities. Gazprom Neft provides financial 
aid to indigenous households and communities 
and implements initiatives to preserve 
their ethnic identity, develop cultural ties 
between them and revive their traditional 
crafts. As part of that, the Company 
supports local festivals – the Reindeer 
Herder’s Day and the Fisherman’s Day. In 
2018, the Reindeer Herder’s Day was held 
in the city of Muravlenko, Khanymey, Novy 
Port, Yar Sale, Tazovsky, Khalyasaway, 
Tolka and Russkinskaya villages, while 
the Fisherman’s Day took place in Novy 
Port village. Every year, Gazprom Neft 
donates money to put into action the projects 
of indigenous northern minorities – the grant 
winners. Among the 2018 initiatives were 
a puppet theatre, organisation of a boat race 
featuring oblases, traditional rowing boats, 
and training in local crafts.Gazpromneft - Yamal
