2Dear PGS shareholder 
In today’s world, corporate responsibility is as essential to 
business success as financial performance. In PGS we act 
responsibly because it is the right thing to do and it motivates 
our employees, investors and customers. This report documents 
how PGS performed against its responsibility goals in 2019 and 
the way forward for 2020.
PGS has embarked on a digital transformation that is deepening our 
understanding of business fundamentals and opening new avenues for 
collaboration that will create fresh commercial opportunities. Our mission  
is to support the energy industry with the right data at the right time.
Our industry has an important role in building a secure future for our planet 
and supplying reliable sources of energy during a sustainable transition to 
greener energy. Energy security is vital for geopolitical stability, global wealth 
and social welfare. In a year where climate change has taken center stage, 
the real story is about providing sustainable sources of energy to a growing 
population and doing that in a sustainable way which respects the planet. 
PGS strives to do its part in supplying that energy and respecting the people 
with whom we cooperate, and on whom we depend.

8Supporting Leaders to 
Nurture Teams Offshore
Offshore, our seismic vessels’ management participate in an 18-month 
Managing Self / Managing Others program (MSMO) designed to help  
them improve their management of others by learning to understand  
how to manage themselves better. 
Led by Jason Liem, whose background is from 
the cognitive sciences, the program focus is 
to teach participants how the mind influences 
behavior. With this understanding, they can learn 
to deal better with stress, focus on the problem 
at hand, and reach better, timely decisions. They 
learn how to give and receive feedback, coach, 
communicate, and manage expectations.
Since the program was first piloted in 2011, 
over 150 department Chiefs, Party Chiefs and 
Captains have completed the process that is 
divided into three major steps. 
The first step is a workshop that combines brain-
based skills, psychology and communication. 
Role-play, based on experience from the offshore 
environment is used to review the application  
of the principles.The second step happens offshore. Managers 
get support in understanding how they are 
perceived as a leader and coach by their crew. 
This encourages managers to set up one-on-
one meetings with their crew every trip. These 
individual meetings are designed to create a 
personal bond with each and every crewmember.
The third and final step is a half-day meeting 
with peers and Jason Liem to determine what 
each participant has learned and how to continue 
building their relationships with their co-workers.
The program has been very successful both as 
measured by the high marks and comments 
from the participants for each full and half-day 
session as well as through our company wide 
Global People Survey.
In the most recent Global People Survey, 
PGS compared the rating of managers who 
completed the MSMO program with others 
who have not. Managers who completed the 
course consistently scored at least 10% higher 
on questions like “In my department we all pull 
in the same direction in order to achieve our 
department’s goals” , and over 20% higher on  
“In my department we openly discuss our 
mistakes in order to learn from them” . PGS  
will continue to invest in this program.// People // Focus Areas

In 2019, we established 
a digital transformation 
team that supports our 
businesses in developing digital 
strategies and reaching the business 
goals underpinning those strategies. 
Technology will be an enabling factor 
to redefine how our teams work and 
leverage our integrated services, how 
we communicate and collaborate 
with our employees, our suppliers 
and our customers. 
Google Cloud was selected as our 
foundation platform for developing 
next-generation interface solutions. By harnessing Google’s cloud-based 
technologies and incorporating 
artificial intelligence and machine 
learning capabilities into workflows, 
PGS will increase flexibility, scalability, 
and deliver more reliable data 
faster to customers. Changing our 
working culture is a fundamental 
step. Together with Google, we have 
initiated a Culture Champion Jumpstart 
Program.  We believe this journey of 
exploration and discovery will increase 
teamwork and innovation, ensuring 
we are well-positioned to gain new 
insights, and leverage new commercial 
opportunities.Our goal is to prepare and adapt PGS 
to an ever-changing digital landscape 
by evolving our corporate culture 
and motivating the entire company 
to embrace a digital mindset. These 
initiatives will build the competences 
of our people, rendering PGS more 
competitive. This will be essential to 
attract and keep the right talent in 
the future. Our customers will benefit 
from enhanced user experience and 
better collaboration, our owners will 
see better resource optimization and 
increased productivity.Digital Transformation
Today, industrial development is at Industry 4.0 – digitalization and the internet 
of things - where everything is connected, making smart solutions and system 
interactivity possible. In order to stay relevant in this new world and continue to 
meet the needs of our customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders, 
PGS needs to transform and prepare for a digital future.// People // Focus Areas

10Digitalizing our HSEQ Processes// People // Focus Areas
Safety and reliability are at the core  
of our business. We work hard 
to ensure that our people return 
home safe and well every day. Sustaining and 
improving HSEQ performance and safety culture 
will remain a priority through 2020 and beyond. 
In 2019, we implemented new tools and modern 
systems that improve risk awareness and 
management, while minimizing bureaucracy  
and administrative burdens.
Streamlined digital HSEQ solution 
As part of our drive to continuously improve and 
better suit PGS processes to future requirements, 
we implemented a new integrated HSEQ 
management system for our offshore operations 
called UniSea.
UniSea is specifically developed for 
organizations with offshore operations and 
onshore management. The platform holds all 
our governing documents and offers HSEQ 
reporting. It provides users with tailored 
dashboards offering easy, real-time access to 
their own documents and HSEQ statistics for 
their department or role.
New functionality eases and streamlines many 
of our activities onshore and offshore. One 
example being fully digital forms and checklists 
that can be completed and signed electronically using tablets or phones. This significantly 
reduces the use of paper and makes information 
sharing easier. Printing, scanning and physical 
storage of forms is also reduced.
Quality – project excellence 
Using advanced digital tools to increase project-
focus within integrated teams was a clear goal 
for our organization last year, and we made 
great strides towards realizing this ambition. 
We launched a project excellence initiative, 
aimed at defining standard project execution 
models in PGS. Our goal was to better manage 
the commercial drivers in every phase of our 
projects, from contract bidding or MultiClient 
idea to delivery of the final image.
Following an extensive review of PGS’ strengths 
in project execution versus general project 
management, then tackling improvement areas, 
we worked on standardizing processes, improving 
project management skills, better defining project 
roles and increasing commercial focus.
This resulted in the formation of two detailed 
PGS Project Execution Models that are based 
on well-defined stages and decision gates. The 
models were implemented across PGS, through 
a comprehensive project management training 
program for all project owners and managers. 
A new PGS project portal captures and shares 
project-execution best practices in each phase  
of a project. 
We are convinced that integrated project 
management facilitated by technology, from 
the start of planning to the final delivery of 
data to our clients, will result in more satisfied 
customers and improved profitability for PGS. 
We also expect that clearer roles for everyone 
involved in managing PGS projects will improve 
cost and risk management.

11Around the World — Right to Play // People // Case Study
In 2018, PGS vessels embraced a fleet-wide 
campaign to log activity points for every 30 
minutes of physical activity. The onboard 
management and medics organized an impressive 
range of activities on our seismic vessels, ranging 
from team sports using the ball court on the 
Titan-class vessels, to strength exercises, yoga 
and even dart competitions. The campaign was  
so popular that it was continued in 2019.
Meanwhile, as part of a ‘Global Challenge’ 
wellness campaign, 133 PGS Houston employees 
walked over 60 000 miles (over 96 000 km) over 
100 days (read more about this on page 29).Having seen the positive impact on morale and 
fitness of these initiative, PGS decided to make 
this a global initiative, with a motivational 
promise to donate to a charity, based on the 
number of circuits of the earth collectively 
completed by our employees. PGS promised 
to donate $10 000 to ‘Right to Play’ for each 
circumnavigation, up to a maximum donation 
of $30 000. The international humanitarian 
organization ‘Right to Play’ is a non-profit charity, 
active in over 15 countries worldwide, with a 
mission to protect, educate, and empower children 
to rise above adversity using the power of play.

12We kick-started a PGS mentoring 
program in 2019, with a 12-month 
pilot program for eleven pairs of 
mentors and mentees who came together for 
initial training in mentoring and continued with 
one-on-one mentoring sessions. Participants 
gained new perspectives from the other 
PGS departments, shared and learned from 
experiences, built new networks and cross-
across relationships, discussed challenges, perceptions and potential future career paths. 
The program is facilitated by an organizational 
psychologist who works internationally as a 
management consultant. 
The first round of the program involved 
participants in the UK and Norway, however 
future programs have a broader international 
scope. The long-term goal of the mentoring 
program is to invest in management talent across 
the business cycle and embed this in PGS culture.Mentoring Program// People // Case Study

13Our emergency response organization conducts 
regular emergency exercises to train, test and 
develop PGS’ ability to handle a crisis. Through 
collaboration with external partners, these 
sessions also provide a great opportunity to 
align communication with external stakeholders, 
so that we are better prepared to handle an 
emergency, if it occurs. 
In our last full-scale exercise, the team simulated 
and managed the potential effects of a collision 
between a seismic vessel and an oil tanker, preparing 
them to deal with a worst case scenario involving 
injuries, fatalities, significant vessel damage and 
an oil spill. 
For the first time, we involve an offshore 
management team located at our seismic 
simulator facility at the University of South-
Eastern Norway, in Horten. 
The vessel crew in the simulator kicked off the 
exercise, trying to avoid collision with a tanker 
in transit. Following the script, the collision was 
inevitable and hard, with serious consequences 
for people on board, the environment, and the 
ship. The captain of the seismic vessel notified Operations management immediately, and 
our operational emergency response team was 
scrambled in Oslo. Their role is to support the 
vessel crew in taking care of personnel, providing 
external assistance and coordinating resources. 
A strategic emergency response team gathered 
in the PGS board room in Oslo, to manage 
strategic decisions and business continuity, 
including efficient communication with key 
strategic stakeholders.
At the end of the exercise, senior management 
conducted a press conference. Invited journalists 
posed challenging questions, presenting the top 
management with an opportunity to train their 
media handling skills. The press conference  
was streamed to the simulator, so the crew 
could watch.
This was a valuable exercise with many identified 
areas for improvement. Communication lines, 
between the vessel crew at the simulator facility 
and onshore management in Oslo, worked well 
as did this new form of exercise including vessel 
teams in the training.Emergency Response Exercise// People // Case Study

14PGS has assets, technology, competence and 
experience that could be leveraged to diversify in 
the future. Through a project named Blue Sky, our 
CEO invited employees to think creatively about 
how PGS might draw upon its current strengths 
to identify new opportunities for the future, 
beyond seismic. 
Brainstorming, in the form of workshops and 
social gatherings, engaged employees in various offices and offshore.  A Blue Sky website was 
established to log ideas, and a task force was 
created to review all the ideas in dialog with the 
originators. The most promising ideas will be 
presented to the top management team.
The project encourages the creative as well as 
business thinking of our employees. Project Blue Sky // People // Case Study

The seismic industry has a role in enabling a reliable supply 
of energy now and in the future through the sustainable 
transition to greener energy. PGS remains devoted to conducting 
our operations with minimal impact on the oceans and those 
that are reliant upon them for their living or sustenance.
Our commitment is to leave the oceans as we find them, and our ambition 
is to contribute to healthier marine environment — for the benefit of all. 
We have therefore refocused our support to the UN SDGs with strong focus 
on Climate Action and Life Below Water. These will be the pillars of our 
environmental strategies and actions going forward.

Leaving the Oceans as we Find them
Seismic surveying by use of acoustic 
imaging is the only viable means of 
mapping the geological structures 
beneath the ocean floor on a large scale. 
Although seismic surveys are safe and leave 
no permanent environmental footprint, there 
may be temporary disturbances. We go to great 
lengths to minimize any transient effects on 
marine life from our operations.
Understanding how seismic surveys may 
affect ocean habitats is key to minimizing the 
disturbance potentially caused by our operations. 
Months ahead of a seismic vessel arriving at the 
location of a survey, our scientists carry out careful 
analysis and planning. We collaborate closely with 
regulatory authorities and other stakeholders and 
the process is strictly governed by law. No survey 
takes place without an approval process and a 
permit in place. This may include direct dialog 
with potentially affected parties, such as fishing 
communities, before and during a survey.
We are committed to:
Carefully planning and executing surveys to 
minimize any disturbance
Immediately ceasing operations if marine 
mammals are observed in close proximityRespecting local communities and fishermen
Not throwing anything overboard and leaving 
nothing behind
The potential for disturbance of marine life and 
habitats is directly related to the generation 
and transmission of the seismic sound pulses 
that are used to image the geological structures 
beneath the sea floor. This technique, which 
is very similar to medical ultrasound, has been 
used for close to a century. Today, the signal is 
generated by compressed air sources.
We have committed significant resources towards 
developing a new generation of seismic sources: 
eSeismic is a method for generating continuous 
signals with lower amplitudes, while marine 
vibrators may offer an alternative to compressed 
air. Both the PGS eSeismic method and our 
preferred design for a marine vibrator are in 
advanced stages of development (see case study).

Contributing to Healthier Oceans
Safeguarding the health of our ocean 
environment will require commitment 
from companies and communities, 
and greater scientific understanding informed 
by reliable data sources. We see firsthand the 
problems of pollution of the oceans and we 
are committed to doing what we can to ensure 
future generations can benefit from the oceans 
like past ones have.
The ocean environment is vast and there is a 
severe lack of knowledge and data for scientists 
to work on. In 2017 , PGS launched a Global 
Ocean Data Sharing Initiative. Since then we 
have provided ocean data such as temperature, 
salinity, and currents to research organizations 
around the world. In 2019, we signed a 
memorandum of understanding with Seabed 
2030 — an organization whose aim is to map 
the entire ocean floor by 2030. In 2020, all PGS 
vessels will collect bathymetry data 24/7/365 
and deliver this data to Seabed 2030.
Seismic operations suffer from the littering 
and plastic pollution of the oceans first hand. Everywhere they work, PGS seismic crews 
remove debris, waste, and ghost nets tangled 
in their equipment. Over the past five years, 
the PGS fleet has removed close to 200 tons of 
floating debris from the sea. In 2020, we will 
intensify our effort to find and recover such 
pollution. We are developing advanced detection 
capabilities using drones and echo sounders to 
spot marine pollution during our surveys, and 
we continue to work on advanced solutions for 
plastic removal.
Hydrocarbons will remain an important energy 
source during the transition to greener energy, 
however we shall do our utmost to minimize the 
carbon footprint of our operations. Over the past 
decade, PGS has reduced its CO² emissions per 
data unit* by 30% and has set a target to reach 
50% by 2030. We will achieve this by reducing drag 
on our vessels and equipment, maximizing the 
efficiency of our fleet and optimizing the utilization 
of our resources. Digitalization and data analytics 
can enable significant improvements in this arena. 
In 2020, we started development of new advanced 
operations optimization capabilities.

19The Marine Vibrator Tailors Bandwidth 
for Environmental Sensitivity
The advantage of using marine vibrators over compressed 
air sources is the ability to limit audio signals to only the 
frequency range necessary for seismic. PGS’s latest vibrator 
source is all-electric and demands less energy, without the 
need to operate large air compressors. 
The key difference PGS’ vibrator has to other designs is that 
the densely stacked plates significantly increase the total 
surface area while minimizing the overall unit size. Sufficient 
sound pressure is produced at the crucial lower end of the 
frequency band at operational depth. Accurate control of 
system resonance means the structural load of the vibrator 
is secure. So far, the design has proved itself robust and 
reliable during both a 1 000 hour tank test, and at full power 
at depths of 60 meters in a harbor. The next step will be to 
perform a geophysical test comparing data results to PGS 
MultiClient data acquired with a traditional source.
The eSeismic Approach, Quieter and More Efficient
The eSeismic method can be used with either marine 
vibrator technology or with standard air source elements  to provide a quieter environment for fish and sea mammals. 
While the standard seismic method uses a simultaneous 
array of 30 air source elements, eSeismic uses only one at 
a time. It releases an alternation of 40, 90, and 150 cubic 
inch source elements several times a second to generate 
a continuous wavefield. Sound exposure and peak sound 
pressure levels are significantly reduced compared to 
standard methods which typically releases 4130 cubic  
inches of compressed air every 10 seconds.
The eSeismic method provides a quieter environment for 
fish and sea mammals, which is the primary environmental 
benefit of this method.
A recent field trial offshore Brazil showed significantly  
lower sound pressure levels than traditionally produced.  
The viability of eSeismic in assessing deep geological layers 
was successfully proven and commercialization work is 
ongoing. PGS plans to acquire more eSeismic data in 2020.
Development of eSeismic technology has been supported 
by the Research Council of Norway through the Demo2000 
program in collaboration with Equinor.Electrical Marine Vibrator and eSeismic

20Leveraging fleet productivity and technology 
is an important pillar of PGS business strategy. 
We strive continually to reduce emissions of 
greenhouse gases per unit of data collected, by applying 
modern technology to improve fuel efficiency, voyage 
planning, and logistics.
Since 2011, we have reduced our CO² emissions by close 
to 30%. We believe that we can do more, by further 
maximizing efficiency, optimizing unitization and reducing 
drag. Our goal is to achieve a 50% reduction by 2030, 
compared to 2011.
We make continuous efforts to optimize the energy 
efficiency of our operations through analysis and smart 
technology. Here are some of the initiatives that we  
have implemented:
Fuel plans for all transits and jobs
Reducing transit speeds Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans (SEEMPs)  
for all vessels
Optimizing engines and compressors to run on high  
load at 85% MCR
Ship performance dashboards on Ramform Titan class 
(monitor emissions, fuel and power consumption)
By reducing drag from towed equipment, our operations 
technical team hopes to significantly improve fuel 
consumption. The introduction of steerable paravanes 
with active bridle blocks is one of many incremental 
improvements contributing to this goal.
PGS is using its digital transformation process to accelerate 
strategy execution. We are working to refine our approaches 
to optimize fuel consumption by analyzing contextualized 
data gathered and applied through a combination of 
operations technology and information technology. In 2020, 
PGS has partnered with Cognite, a global industrial artificial 
intelligence software-as-a-service company, to work on this.Reduction of CO² Emission

We continue to conduct our business openly and transparently. 
Monitoring and mitigating business integrity risks will remain  
a major focus for us.
Continous Improvement of our 
Anti-Corruption Program
We aim to continually improve our 
anti-corruption program and are always on the 
lookout for better ways to stop/fight/prevent 
corruption. During the past year we made a 
number of improvements.
We streamlined and simplified our anti-
corruption manual, making it easier for 
managers and employees to read and find what 
they need. We also automated more of our 
compliance work, including the due diligence 
process for our business partners where we 
introduced automated annual confirmations.
On the training front, we introduced a nano-
learning program to ensure that we maintain the 
high level of awareness amongst our employees. It provides employees with very short lessons 
over several months, to enhance and embed the 
learning effect. This complements our existing 
extensive anti-corruption training for new 
employees and in-person training for people in 
exposed roles.
It is many years since PGS established its anti-
corruption program. To assess the design and 
functioning of the program, we commissioned 
an independent external company to compare 
our program to an internationally recognized 
standard (ISO) on anti-bribery management. 
They carried out a gap analysis and concluded 
that the PGS program is strong and well-
functioning. However, as we also hoped, it also 
gave us some ideas for improvements that we 
can make in the coming years.

23PGS devised a simple but effective 
method to help our travelers avoid 
making small facilitation payments. 
The passport-sized cards (pictured above)  
state our policy on facilitation payments in five 
languages:  Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, French,  
as well as English. We don’t pay.
The card design matches a standard-sized 
passport, making it easy to carry. They have 
been issued to all offshore crew and many others 
who travel regularly. The idea was born on one of 
our seismic vessels. 
Our offshore crew are occasionally confronted 
by requests for small facilitation payments. This 
typically happens during customs or passport 
checks and it can be a stressful situation 
because PGS does not condone facilitation 
payments. The problem was discussed during 
an anti-corruption workshop onboard our vessel 
Ramform Sovereign. The crew came up with the 
idea of having a card that they could show to 
officials, to explain that they were not allowed to make payments. The suggestion was passed 
on to our compliance department. 
“We should remember that to avoid getting 
into difficult situations, it is important to be 
well prepared, ” says Carl Deschington, Head 
of Compliance. “You should make sure you 
have plenty of time and have all the necessary 
documentation. But if you do get pressure then 
these cards help. ”
The cards proved to be useful when a PGS 
vessels was recently subject to a local inspection. 
The inspector claimed to have found a seemingly 
unfounded fault and demanded payment in 
the form of bottles of olive oil, threatening to 
impose a fine if we refused to deliver the oil. 
When the PGS captain showed his “We don’t 
pay” card, the inspector changed his conclusion 
and gave us a clean report.
We recently printed our third batch of these 
cards, following positive feedback from 
employees who clearly value this new tool  
to prevent corruption.Don’t Ask We Don’t Pay // Conduct // Case Study

Increasing Economic Productivity 
— Reducing Turnaround Time 
Using our pioneering spirit, we will collaborate 
with the energy industry and lead the way in the 
search for new resources. This is our corporate 
vision and our goal is to help our clients meet 
the challenge of growing energy demand in the 
most efficient way possible. To maximize the 
benefit for our clients, we must continue to 
listen carefully to their needs and serve them 
better than our competition does. 
Cycle time is a hot topic in our industry. Our 
clients are asking us to shorten the turnaround 
time from planning a survey to delivering the 
data. That requires close cooperation with the 
clients and an integrated process for acquisition 
and imaging. By planning both together, we 
can do more of these phases in parallel to 
significantly shorten the total project time.
Over the next three years, PGS aims to significantly 
reduce turnaround time from the start of formal 
project planning to the delivery of final products, by 
combining quick wins and more significant changes 
to work-processes and technology. Reduced project 
turnaround is linked to strategy targets and new 
project execution models.
Several full-scale pilot projects have 
demonstrated that detailed project planning and 
project delivery schedules pay off in streamlined 
change management and commercial discipline. 
On time critical projects, we aim to reliably reduce 
project turnaround by 50% by the end of 2021. Digitization as a Tool to Enhance 
Supplier Management 
PGS’ digital journey is well underway 
with the selection of Google as our cloud provider 
and the setup of a digital transformation team.  
Our procurement organization is preparing for 
more automated and efficient handling of our 
supply chain.
The first step we have taken is to identify the 
key pain points within procurement today. 
On the logistics front many of our enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) systems and IT 
applications do not communicate seamlessly. 
This slows down the logistics, increases cost 
and makes it difficult to achieve transparency 
on the process. Better system integration will 
increase automation, lower costs, speed up 
shipments, and provide better data for analysis 
of improvement areas and a stronger foundation 
for planning future shipments.  
Our operational procurement processes involve a 
high degree of manual handling and significant 
room for making data input punching-errors. 
Digitalization of the procurement-to-payment 
processes will reduce the manual work, increasing 
efficiency, and improving cost control. This will 
help us to maintain a high degree of compliance 
with our Procurement & Contracting Policy. 
For the sourcing team, many applications 
and little integration results in frustration 
and duplication. Today, we have systems for 
agreement filing and monitoring, signing 
of agreements, risk management, supplier 
qualifications, and tender processes, to name 
a few. Digital transformation may enable more 
efficient supply management, lower supply risk 
and offer competitive advantages. 
By looking outside our own industry, we have 
found benchmarks for automation and platforms 
to enhance the supply chain that far outstrip our 
current solutions. In 2020, we plan to develop a 
strong and incremental digital procurement strategy 
and set clear, measurable goals on automation of 
our procurement and contracting processes.

26Cultivating Good Relationships 
with Critical Suppliers 
PGS has established a thorough supplier 
relationship process to ensure that we have 
adequate control and management of our critical 
suppliers. The process involves key internal 
stakeholders and regular strategic business 
review meetings. These meetings review 
cooperation, to ensure we have good working 
procedures, a high level of communication and 
mutual trust. The review contains forward-
looking elements, in addition to the last years’ 
projects and purchases. A common scorecard 
is used to systematically evaluate the key 
elements of the relationship on a rolling basis.
By performing quarterly or half-year 
business review meetings, we secure mutual 
improvement and capture key lessons learned. 
This allows us to manage supplier risk, optimize 
our commercial terms, and reward supplier 
innovations. As always, we support and 
encourage open and honest communication in 
these sessions, in order to solve potential issues 
as early as possible.   
We are finalizing the supplier review 
management plan for 2020 and it is our 
ambition to continue to cultivate strong supplier 
relationships, as we believe that this offers a 
competitive advantage to PGS going forward.  Improving Opportunities for 
University of Ghana Students
PGS and the University of Ghana  
have signed a memorandum of understanding 
with a view to improving opportunities for less 
advantaged Ghanaian students wishing to progress  
their geoscience studies to MSc or PhD level. 
This agreement underlines PGS’ long-standing 
commitment to Ghana by providing opportunity 
for a multi-year scholarship program where PGS 
supports the MSc and PhD studies of promising 
Ghanaian students who would otherwise be 
unable to fund further study. The program would 
include financial support to students’ studies, 
guest lecturers, student vessel visits and aims to 
achieve a clear pathway from academic study to 
the oil and gas industry.
This initiative highlights the importance of 
collaboration between academia and industry 
in ensuring students who choose to study 
geosciences are able to make the transition 
between study and practical application. // Stakeholders // Focus Areas

27Our activities can have a positive 
effect on the communities where 
we operate, and we strive to work 
with communities through partnerships and 
programs to create long-term value, for example 
within education.
In 2017 , PGS launched an offshore summer 
internship program for Canadians. In cooperation 
with Memorial University, PGS supports the 
Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore 
Petroleum Board goals of competency transfer 
to local communities. 
Last summer, four earth science undergraduates 
from Newfoundland joined the PGS teams, first in our Houston Imaging center for three weeks, 
and then on a Ramform seismic vessel offshore 
Newfoundland and Labrador for a period of five 
weeks. This eight-week internship offers hands-
on learning in marine seismic data acquisition 
and processing. Both in the Imaging center 
and offshore, the interns apply the concepts 
they have learned in school, supervised by 
experienced PGS professionals. 
The program offers young Canadian geophysicists 
a unique work experience. The trip offshore, 
in particular, is a unique opportunity to build 
confidence through exposure to working life  
with an international crew.Offshore Summer Internship Program// Stakeholders // Case Study

28In our 2018 report we presented the ECHO 
initiative in our Houston office, where PGS staff 
work together as volunteers to Enhance Culture 
and Heighten Opportunities – ECHO, through four 
core improvement areas (Learning), Connecting 
(Building Relationships), Striving (Health & 
Wellness) and Sharing (Charity & Philanthropy). 
Last year, the ECHO initiative continued to grow 
and flourish, and introduced the Global Challenge 
to PGS. This Virgin Pulse wellbeing solution equips 
employees with knowledge, tools and support to 
build healthy habits that last a lifetime. 
Nineteen PGS teams of seven people each signed 
up for the challenge, which takes employees on a 
100-day virtual journey through the world’s most 
unique locations.  PGS competed against 518 teams from around 
the world to earn virtual trophies and face off 
against other teams in activity mini-challenges. 
They walked, swam, and cycled to improve both 
health and happiness by completing modules in 
nutrition, sleep, balance, and focus.
The minimum goal was for each team member 
to make at least 10 000 steps per day over a 100 
day cycle. By the end of the 100-day challenge, 
the 133 PGS Houston employees had walked 
over 60 000 miles!  Participants learned how 
simply taking steps has significant impact on 
health, wellness, and energy levels, as well as 
concentration and mood.The Echo Resounds and
