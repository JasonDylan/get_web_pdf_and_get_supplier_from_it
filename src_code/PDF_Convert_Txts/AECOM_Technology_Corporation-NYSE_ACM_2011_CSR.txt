I am proud to introduce our first 
global sustainability report, “Create. 
Enhance. Sustain.” This is the first 
unified report that highlights the work 
of the global AECOM family across 
our capabilities, geographies and 
talents. It is intended to outline our 
expectations relative to governing 
AECOM sustainably and successfully 
into the future, and to establish an 
understanding and appreciation of  
the benefits our sustainability 
approach will yield our employees,  
our clients, our stakeholders, and  
our communities.
AECOM employees care deeply about 
the impact our work leaves on our 
world and our communities. As a 
global citizen, we are committed to 
our purpose: to create, enhance and 
sustain the world’s built, natural 
and social environments. There is a 
strong commitment from leadership 
to foster the ideas and methods of a 
sustainable approach in everything we 
do — ultimately, to apply our expertise 
to make the world a better place. We will 
strive to ensure a sustainable balance in 
all of our operations and projects. 
In all of our activities, we will develop 
and implement appropriate systems 
and ideas designed to create value 
across four types of capital: financial, 
natural, human and social. AECOM 
is continuing to plan and design its 
processes, facilities and projects 
in a manner that reduces risks and 
impacts during their entire lifecycle, 
consistent with the direction and 
objectives of our clients.
Our ultimate sustainable goals are 
derived from AECOM’s Core Values:
 - help our clients be more successful 
in the future;
 - operate all of our systems to reduce 
waste and consumption in order to 
maximize opportunity and innovation;
 - build an inclusive corporate culture 
that understands sustainability as 
a framework for decision making 
that manages risk and creates 
opportunity.
Foreword
John M. Dionisio 
Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe year 2011 was marked by 
increased communication and 
collaboration among AECOM 
professionals around the world, as 
we continued to bring our clients 
the advantages of our breadth and 
depth of expertise and thinking. The 
examples in this report illustrate best 
practices to date — those instances 
where an integrated, thoughtful 
approach has created long-term 
value for our clients, society and the 
AECOM community while stewarding 
the Earth’s natural resources. 
A successful AECOM project:
 - grows the economy
 - reduces consumption
 - may anticipate legislation
 - adapts to environmental change
 - creates something beautiful
 - facilitates more informed  
decision making
 - builds communities
 - manages risk
 - improves public health
 - increases resilience.
With these objectives in mind, our 
sustainability report is intended 
to provide a clear, concise and 
transparent understanding of 
AECOM’s progress toward becoming 
a more sustainable company, and 
toward helping our clients become 
more sustainable, and therefore 
more successful, in the future.
We also hope this report will inspire 
our employees to continue to 
innovate and excel in improving the 
way we help our clients meet their 
challenges — working together to 
provide best-in-class, integrated 
solutions for a sustainable future.
Our 2011 Sustainability Report 3
About our report 
This report follows the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI), the standard accepted 
worldwide for sustainability reporting. 
Page 40 contains a table cross-
referencing the content of this 
report with the GRI guidelines, 
version 3.1. AECOM plans to publish 
a sustainability report annually, 
covering its fiscal year. This report 
covers the period October 1, 2010 to 
September 30, 2011.
This is AECOM’s first global 
sustainability report. The Australia 
and New Zealand geography published 
reports from 2008 to 2010; the Asia 
geography published an interim 
report in 2010, and our Design + 
Planning capability reported in 2009. 
This report does not restate any 
information from previous reports.
This report includes details of 
AECOM’s direct operations and 
companies it acquired — but was still 
integrating — during 2011. We exclude 
joint ventures where AECOM was not 
the lead partner.
AECOM self-declares that we have 
applied GRI Application Level C.  
Giovanna (Joanne) Petrini, BA, LLB,

Sustainability requires that we consider 
the future as a stakeholder in every 
current choice. That causality, and the 
specifics of the future beyond five years 
are mostly unknowable, makes this a 
profoundly vexing problem. This makes 
clear objectives, continuous learning, 
innovation and capacity for adaptation 
keys to sustainability. 
Urbanization, climate, water, 
energy, mobility, economic security, 
environmental and human health, and 
food are just some of the interrelated 
issues that will define the future of our 
societies.  Understanding the interplay 
of four types of capital — financial, 
natural, human and social — and how 
and where to intervene so that each 
capital class creates value in the others, 
will be the determinants of our success. 
Ultimately, sustainability is about 
mastering complexity in ways that 
optimize conditions for human 
development. AECOM — in breadth 
and depth — has been called upon to 
master that complexity on behalf of our 
clients, so that they, we and society 
can be more successful today and in 
the future. That means we have to be 
beyond smart. We have to be brilliant. 
This report is our first benchmark in 
how we are moving toward brilliance.
Based on our understanding of the 
opportunities to create economic, 
social, environmental and human value 
while managing the risks posed by an 
uncertain future, AECOM recognizes 
that the ideas and principles of 
sustainability provide the most robust 
decision-making framework we could 
ask for. Sustainability underpins much 
of what we care about, who we are, 
what we do and how we do it.
Sustainability at AECOM is an 
operational idea. It is about how we 
operate the company to increase 
efficiency, reduce waste and save 
money through innovation. Similarly,  
we work with our clients to optimize 
value returned on their investments  
by using scarce resources wisely  
and replenishing ecosystems. Our employees are concerned about 
climate change, poverty, environmental 
damage and inequity. Fortunately, our 
work provides many areas for action 
to benefit society, the environment, 
people today and generations to come.
Sustainability at AECOM is a corporate-
culture idea. It is about appreciating 
that we are engaged in a social 
process as well as a business process, 
with every project presenting the 
opportunity to create circumstances in 
which people can improve their lives.
Our professionals appreciate the 
interdependence of financial, natural, 
social and human systems and work 
hard to understand the relationships. 
AECOM professionals thrive on 
unraveling complexity. To ensure the 
continued success of AECOM, our 
shareholders and clients, we resist 
sacrificing long-term value creation  
for short-term returns: the two ideas 
must be mutually reinforcing.
As part of this culture, AECOM and 
its employees have a long history of 
improving the communities where we 
work and live — for example, by aiding 
in the recovery of natural disasters.
Sustainability at AECOM is a business 
idea. It is about how we help our clients 
and ourselves to be more successful in 
an uncertain future where change is  
the only way forward.
AECOM’s strength lies in our great 
diversity. We are organized to draw 
upon our deep knowledge, across 
geographies, markets and disciplines, 
to broaden the number of things we 
examine before we make a choice.  
Every intersection provides the 
opportunity to consider not just profit 
but also value creation, risk mitigation 
and opportunities for future success.
Finally, sustainability at AECOM is a 
robust management system that allows 
us to consider the future as a constituent 
of the present, as we act to help our 
clients make investment decisions that 
will create value of financial, natural, 
human and social significance.

Mexico forest inventory 
Mexico 
As one of Mexico’s most vital renewable 
resources, its forests require a long-
term, progressive management plan. 
Since 2004, AECOM has been working 
with the National Forest Commission 
of Mexico (CONAFOR) as part of a 
larger program aiming to help the 
Mexican government responsibly 
manage its forests by cataloging and 
recording vegetation.

Sea-level rise vulnerability and risk assessment 
San Francisco Bay Area, United States
The United States’ fifth most populated 
urban center is facing significant 
climate-change impacts — including 
rising seas, which threaten shoreline 
homes and businesses. In response 
to this threat, AECOM completed a 
detailed subregional vulnerability 
analysis on the effects of sea-level rise 
on transportation infrastructure. We 
also produced detailed maps showing 
depth of inundation of the project area 
for six different time and tide scenarios. 
The analysis will guide future investment 
decisions along the shoreline.

Global Cities program 
Beijing, China 
China’s rapid growth is highlighting 
the many social and environmental 
challenges facing its capital, 
Beijing. Through the AECOM Global 
Cities Institute, we are drawing on 
our integrated planning, design, 
engineering and management 
capabilities to identify steps Beijing 
can take to continue as a world city, 
including the rejuvenation of its 
waterfront and the creation of denser 
urban environments.
By conceptualizing innovative and 
actionable pilot projects and initiatives 
for the city, we are helping Beijing 
advance sustainable growth and address 
barriers to environmental progress, as 
it continues its transformation into a 
socioeconomic, political, cultural and 
technological center.6 AECOM
Doha’s rapid urbanization has 
resulted in its city center losing its

High-speed rail, Merced to Fresno 
California, United States
As the most populous U.S. state, 
California must constantly reassess 
its transportation infrastructure 
to ensure it meets the needs of its 
growing population. AECOM is leading 
the cultural resources investigations 
in support of an environmental impact 
statement and accompanying report for 
a section of an ambitious high-speed 
rail project that will ultimately link 
Sacramento with San Diego. 
The project involves the evaluation 
of three 100km corridors, a variety of 
routing options, and numerous station 
and maintenance facilities. Work 
completed to date has documented  
13 locations of archaeological 
sensitivity and more than 500 historic 
resources, ensuring the rail network will 
be developed mindful and respectful of 
California’s cultural heritage.3
MediaCityUK 
Manchester, United Kingdom
The BBC was relocating five major 
departments from London, and wanted 
to join existing regional teams to create 
a new BBC Northern Hub in Salford, 
Manchester. AECOM provided a range 
of end-to-end services, integrating 
its engineering approach into the 
building’s design. This influenced the 
building’s façade design, determined 
which construction materials were 
used, and optimized natural light and 
heat loss/gain. To help achieve a BRE 
Environmental Assessment Method 
(BREEAM) rating of excellent, we 
combined energy-efficient engineering 
systems to reduce energy use. The 
building achieved a CO 2 reduction of 35 
percent against U.K. building regulations, 
despite being heavily serviced as a TV 
and radio broadcast facility.2
Flinders Medical Centre — New South Wing 
Adelaide, Australia
South Australia’s state government 
wanted this hospital redevelopment 
to reflect a strong commitment to 
environmentally sustainable design. 
AECOM, as sustainability consultants 
and building services engineers, 
implemented a range of sustainable 
features, including one of Australia’s 
largest energy-efficient centralized 
air-conditioning systems and a 
286-panel solar hot water system. 
The center’s New South Wing is  
the first hospital building in Australia  
to receive a prestigious 5-Star Green 
Star Health care Design rating by the 
Green Building Council of Australia, 
setting a precedent for health 
facilities nationwide. The project 
was also awarded a commendation 
in the Environments category of the 
2011 South Australian Engineering 
Excellence Awards.10 AECOM
The influence AECOM has on 
communities and the environment 
results from designs and plans created 
by AECOM professionals, which are 
then implemented by our clients. 
Long-term implications include the 
longevity of infrastructure and its 
operational energy and resource 
demands. There are also immediate 
impacts from building structures 
designed by AECOM, such as where 
habitat makes way for structures. 
Less significant, but still a priority, is 
the direct impact from our operations, 
notably our travel and energy use. 
AECOM professionals consider all 
these impacts and collaborate with 
clients to minimize impacts and take 
advantage of opportunities to improve 
sustainability.
As a public company, AECOM files 
periodic reports with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
that include risk factors regarding its 
business. Some of these risks include:
 - the competitive nature of our 
business; 
 - misconduct by our employees or 
consultants or our failure to comply 
with laws or regulations applicable 
to our business; and
 - exposure to legal, political and 
economic risks in different countries 
as well as currency exchange rate 
fluctuations.
Additional risk factors that could 
affect our business are set forth in 
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 
the period ended September 30, 2011, 
and our other filings with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 
which is available on our website at 
www.aecom.com.
The support for sustainable practices 
offers numerous opportunities for 
AECOM and our stakeholders. The “Our Thinking” section highlights 
these opportunities, including:
 - saving clients money through 
sustainable innovation
 - increasing the pace of innovation 
through global knowledge sharing
 - finding internal cost-saving 
measures such as reducing air travel
 - making positive contributions to 
developing countries.
AECOM’s business will be affected 
over the long term by sustainability 
trends, risks and opportunities. In the 
lead-up to 2012’s Rio+20, the United 
Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development, the United Nations has 
characterized these as:
Poverty eradication, food security, 
sound water management, universal 
access to modern energy services, 
sustainable cities, management of 
oceans and improving resilience and 
disaster preparedness, as well as public 
health, human resource development 
and sustained, inclusive and equitable 
growth that generates employment... 
A green economy... should protect 
and enhance the natural resource 
base, increase resource efficiency, 
promote sustainable consumption and 
production patterns, and move the 
world toward low-carbon development.
AECOM will benefit where it can 
work with clients to contribute to 
solutions. Our priorities address the 
transition to low-carbon energy, as 
well as urbanization and infrastructure 
development that enhances 
sustainability and resilience. This  
flows naturally from AECOM’s core 
purpose — to create, enhance and 
sustain the world’s built, natural and 
social environments.AECOM will

Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates 
Achieving a 2 Pearl Design Rating under Abu Dhabi’s 
sustainability rating system, Estidama, was the goal for  
this new three-level shopping mall. As lead consultant,  
AECOM is working closely with project stakeholders, 
encouraging multidisciplinary input to the overall 
sustainability of the building. We are also optimizing  
energy use and potable water consumption. For example,  
a condensate recovery system will capture humidity in the 
mall and recycle it in the building’s exterior water features.

helicopters. In providing the building’s sustainable design, 
AECOM architects and engineers focused on maximizing 
energy efficiency, improving occupant comfort and using 
sustainable materials, while achieving high levels of 
acoustic and thermal insulation. This industrial building is 
New Zealand’s first to receive a prestigious 5 Star Green 
Star rating, and supports the achievement of the RNZAF’s 
long-term training and operational objectives.

Sustainable Warburton project  
Western Australia, Australia
The future of remote Aboriginal communities in Australia 
depends on a sustainable approach to infrastructure 
planning and development. AECOM is partnering with  
local indigenous communities and academia in the remote  
Western Australian town of Warburton for this research, 
design and planning project that will create new and  
improved urban spaces. Its aim is to provide new 
opportunities for how indigenous people live.

Global dairy company carbon footprint assessment
Europe 
This global dairy company wanted to understand  
where greenhouse gas emissions were generated in its  
factory operation and supply chain. AECOM provided a 
carbon-footprint framework using a lifecycle analysis 
approach, presenting plant owners with business case 
opportunities to reduce emissions, and a technically  
credible carbon-footprint framework and methodologies  
that can be applied to corporate operations. 
412 AECOM
We have identified matters and 
priorities through our stakeholder 
engagement activities. We also took 
a holistic view of AECOM’s impacts, 
using means such as media searches 
and peer benchmarking.
When comparing the issues and 
prioritization by external stakeholders 
to those of internal stakeholders, 
it emerged that environmental 
performance is of higher importance  
to internal stakeholders than to 
external stakeholders. The results  
also show that ethical business 
practices, implementing sustainability 
into our projects and decision making 
about the types of projects we are 
involved in are key priorities for 
external and internal stakeholders.
The workshop in Brisbane produced  
the following insights:
 - sustainability needs to be  
practical and simple
 - action has to match rhetoric
 - cost is a significant factor, and  
value must be demonstrated
 - engaging and responding to 
communities is critical
 - leadership drives culture to  
prioritize sustainability
 - innovation is vital.
Stakeholder engagement for 
sustainability requires a more formalized 
approach, and the process of preparing 
our first global sustainability report has 
presented an opportunity to extend 
our existing methods of engagement 
and to direct additional attention to 
stakeholder groups whose voices 
may not be heard through traditional 
stakeholder engagement.At AECOM, we engage with stakeholders, 
which include our employees, clients 
and communities, in a variety of ways 
as part of our business activities. To 
help shape decisions about what to 
include in this report and seek insights 
into how our business was perceived 
from a sustainability perspective, we 
undertook additional engagement 
activities throughout 2011.
The accompanying table outlines 
our key stakeholder groups, how 
we engaged with them and any key 
topics. Our approach to stakeholder 
engagement was exploratory and had a 
greater focus on the Australia and New 
Zealand geography than we will have 
in future years. The mix of specific 
activities for this reporting process is 
presented in the table.
In June 2010, AECOM asked employees 
around the world to participate in its 
first global employee engagement 
survey, “Your Voice Matters.” Eighty-
one percent of eligible employees 
responded, making it clear that our 
employees wanted to have a voice 
in how AECOM’s journey would 
continue to evolve. During 2011, we 
implemented a range of actions, 
programs and initiatives based on  
our employees’ feedback.
AECOM undertakes periodic 
quantitative research to improve 
client services, including our Strategic 
Partnership Program, “lessons learned” 
sessions following completion of 
projects, and an annual client survey. 
The client survey gives customers 
an opportunity to rate AECOM 
on criteria such as listening and 
understanding client requirements; 
technical competence of the project 
team; value of services; trust and 
confidence in AECOM as a consultant; 
and satisfaction with quality, safety 
and environmental performance. We 
use the data to identify trends and 
opportunities for improvement.At the Leadership Development 
Conference held in Hong Kong, our 
Asia geography conducted a survey 
on sustainability and how it was 
addressed within AECOM. The survey’s 
28 questions focused on internal 
commitment, communication and 
achievements regarding sustainability, 
as well as the awareness and 
empowerment of staff and sustainable 
outcomes of projects. 
To further develop our stakeholder 
engagement approaches, we 
implemented a trial stakeholder 
engagement plan in Australia and New 
Zealand during 2011. This enabled more 
detailed stakeholder mapping and 
testing of techniques prior to extending 
this across our global operations. We 
will apply these experiences to map 
stakeholders in other geographies and 
formalize engagement progressively 
over coming years. AECOM’s global 
sustainability report will provide  
an annual opportunity to report on  
the progress of formalizing our 
stakeholder engagement.
One feature of the trial plan 
was a stakeholder engagement 
workshop held at AECOM’s office 
in Brisbane, Australia, to which key 
clients, partners, academics and 
representatives from government and 
non-government organizations (NGOs) 
were invited. The workshop’s purpose 
was to contribute to the preparation of 
this first global sustainability report by 
starting a dialogue about the relevance 
and importance of sustainability, and 
how we can create and gain greater 
mutual value with stakeholders.
What is important to us and  
our stakeholders?
According to GRI reporting standards, 
our sustainability report should include 
relevant topics and indicators that may 
reasonably be considered important 
for reflecting the organization’s 
economic, environmental and social 
impacts, or for influencing the 
decisions of stakeholders. Our stakeholdersOur 2011 Sustainability Report 13

AECOM recognizes that many measures 
to protect our natural resources also 
provide the opportunity to create 
economic, social and human value. We 
have an obligation to help our clients 
optimize the value returned on their 
investment by using scarce resources 
wisely and efficiently, and in ways that 
produce the least amount of waste. We 
also seek, wherever possible, to replenish 
ecosystems and use ecosystem services 
that substitute for human intervention, 
particularly in the areas of water quality 
and flood protection. 
In many of the countries where we 
work, population growth is exceeding 
all precedents. AECOM is working ever 
more collaboratively with our clients 
to implement sustainable options that 
protect our environment and ensure 
sustainable operations for our clients 
into the future.
The policy governing AECOM’s 
environmental management is our 
Safety, Health and Environment (SH&E) 
Policy Statement — adopted on April 
13, 2009, and reviewed annually. In 
fact, it’s published in our Corporate 
Social Responsibility Review. Our policy 
includes the following commitment 
statement:
AECOM is committed to protecting the 
safety and health of our employees and 
meeting our obligations with respect 
to the protection of others affected by 
our activities. We are also committed to 
protecting and preserving the natural 
environment in which we operate.  
We will actively seek to conserve 
energy, water and natural resources, 
and to recycle and reduce waste where 
appropriate during the execution of 
our business activities. We will be 
good corporate citizens by striving to 
ensure that our facilities and operations 
do not pose unreasonable safety or 
environmental risks, and by participating 
in community-related activities that 
promote excellence in safety, health  
and environmental practices. In all of our activities we will develop 
and implement appropriate systems 
and procedures designed to comply 
with applicable laws, legislation, 
licensing requirements and stakeholder 
expectations. AECOM will plan and  
design its processes, facilities and 
projects in a manner that reduces  
risks and impacts during their entire  
lifecycle, consistent with the direction 
and objectives of our clients.
Group chief executives, capability  
leaders and regional leaders 
collaborate to establish SH&E 
programs that implement the policy. 
Globally, AECOM Vice President, 
SH&E, Gary Beswick has the 
lead responsibility for AECOM’s 
environmental management. Gary 
Lawrence, vice president and chief 
sustainability officer, leads AECOM’s 
sustainability efforts by managing 
AECOM’s extensive resources and skills 
in sustainability for projects across 
the company. He is also an AECOM 
spokesperson and thought leader  
on sustainability issues.
We use the international standard  
ISO 14001 for guidance on 
environmental management and have 
achieved certification against this 
standard in North America, Australia, 
New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the 
Middle East and an Asian joint venture 
(Nanching Environmental Protection 
Research & Design Institute Co. Ltd.). 
The environmental management 
systems that we develop under 
this framework include indicators 
and targets. Initially, tracking and 
reporting on our carbon footprint and 
energy use is a priority. Some systems 
within individual geographies include 
environmental goals and targets for 
other parameters, such as paper 
consumption. AECOM will continually 
improve these systems to incorporate 
and track environmental metrics, 
enhance performance and mitigate 
environmental risks.Our approach — environment

Footprint results
The results of AECOM’s initial carbon 
footprint are estimated at 82,700 
tonnes of CO 2-e for the fiscal year (FY) 
2011 (October  2010 through September 
2011). The largest contribution of the 
FY 2011 carbon footprint was from 
indirect sources including business 
travel (45,800t) and purchased 
electricity (29,800t) followed by direct 
sources including office heating and 
fleet vehicles (7,100t). 
Next year, we plan to publish a more 
complete footprint and investigate 
goals for reducing emissions. The Asia 
and the Australia and New Zealand 
geographies have already set targets 
for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, 
which have become elements of their 
environmental management systems. 
Similarly, AECOM has purchased some 
renewable electricity and carbon offsets 
within geographies as part of existing 
emission-reduction commitments.Scope 1 emissions included stationary 
combustion and company-owned or 
company-controlled vehicles. Scope 
1 emission estimates were based 
on measured or calculated energy 
consumption and vehicle miles traveled 
using appropriate emission factors. 
Scope 2 emissions were estimated 
using electricity consumption and 
utility specific or electricity grid factors. 
Our scope 3 business travel emissions 
were based on miles traveled via rail, 
air and rental car using appropriate 
emission factors. 
The Enablon Web-based Energy 
and Carbon Management Software 
was used to manage the data and to 
calculate and report AECOM’s carbon 
footprint.  We selected the appropriate 
emission factors for sources and used 
activity data to make estimations. Global action is required to reduce 
emissions of greenhouse gases in a 
timeframe that minimizes the risks 
of serious human impact on Earth’s 
natural systems. Today’s global 
economy is powered largely by fossil 
fuels: coal, oil and gas. Fossil fuel 
combustion increases the amount 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, 
which, along with other greenhouse 
gas emissions, warms the planet, 
affecting global populations, natural 
resources, economies and businesses. 
The challenges are clear. Society must 
move reliably toward a decarbonized 
energy system in a manner that 
minimizes the transition costs, avoids 
economic dislocations and does not 
jeopardize the economic development 
of poorer nations. There is no single 
solution — de-carbonization of the 
energy system will require global 
action from all key sectors.
In addition to working with clients to 
find opportunities to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions on projects, AECOM is 
committed to measuring and managing 
the carbon footprint of our operations 
and identifying ways to reduce emissions 
and track and report progress.
A carbon footprint describes the amount 
of greenhouse gases emitted that directly 
and indirectly support a company’s 
activities, expressed as tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalents (CO 2-e). 
Approach in 2011
The first step in a carbon management 
strategy is to develop a robust 
company-wide carbon footprint or 
baseline. To begin this process, we 
developed a footprint for a selection 
of 78 of our offices, including the 50 
largest by floor area. 
We followed the widely recognized 
World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development and World Resources 
Institute’s “Greenhouse Gas Protocol.” 
Setting AECOM’s operational 
boundaries for the carbon footprint 
involved identifying emissions 
associated with operations and 
categorizing them into Scope 1, 2 and 3.Our carbon footprint

carbon contributor —air travel — we 
have implemented 17 Telepresence

In addition to 
working with 
clients to find 
opportunities  
to reduce 
greenhouse gas 
emissions on 
projects, AECOM 
is committed to 
measuring and 
managing the 
carbon footprint  
of its operations.Explanation Operational boundaries for 2011
Scope 1
Direct emissions from sources  
owned or controlled by a company, 
such as stationary combustion  
sources (boilers, furnaces) and 
company vehicles.Sources included 78 company-owned 
or leased offices or sites selected from 
North America (36 offices), Europe  
(7 offices), Australia and New Zealand 
(28 offices/sites), and Asia (7 offices). 
This equates to 47% of our workforce.
Scope 1 also included 1,291 company 
owned or leased vehicles from North 
America and 149 in Australia and  
New Zealand.
Scope 2 
Indirect GHG emissions from 
purchased electricity consumed  
by a company.Purchased electricity and heat included 
from 78 premises specified above. 
Building electricity included tenant  
light and power as well as base  
building components.
Scope 3
An optional reporting category,  
Scope 3 emissions are the 
consequence of company’s activities 
but occur from sources not owned  
or controlled by a company. 
Examples include business travel  
and emissions associated with  
raw materials.Business travel (air, rail and rental 
car) included for employees based in 
North America and Australia and New 
Zealand. Business travel for employees 
in China is included for three months 
and employees in India one month.
Not included 
AECOM’s 2011 carbon footprint was 
not a complete baseline. 
Exclusions were based on insufficient 
quality data or statistical significance 
of data.Excluded were remaining company 
offices, vehicles and business 
travel from other geographies; also, 
commuting, taxi travel, production  
of purchased materials, waste  
disposal, and contractor owned  
vehicles and equipment.

It is not just in our work for clients 
that we pursue sustainability. In every 
AECOM office around the world, local 
initiatives are in place to encourage  
the conservation of energy, water  
and other resources.
AECOM’s global Greening our  
Operations (GO!) program helps us 
to drive workplace sustainability 
and improve on our sustainability 
performance. Through five action 
areas, AECOM employees are provided 
with the tools and knowledge 
necessary to make sustainability a  
part of everything we do:
 - recycling 
 - water saving 
 - green travel 
 - energy saving 
 - community. 
While our GO! activities are linked to  
our environmental management 
systems and audited accordingly,   
each AECOM geography applies the  
five GO! action areas to its own 
respective sustainability challenges. 
For example, in Asia, offices have 
identified four performance metrics 
for sustainability: paper, electricity, 
transportation and water.
Individual AECOM offices have GO! 
champions who drive sustainable 
practices and review office 
performance year-on-year, with a 
view to reducing AECOM’s global 
environmental impact.
Throughout 2011, these collective 
efforts continued to yield results.  
The bringing together of legacy 
companies under the one AECOM 
brand, for example, necessitated the 
co-location of many offices — often in  
new, purpose-designed premises —  
which resulted in energy savings. In 
Australia and New Zealand, 70 percent 
of AECOM employees will work in 5 Star 
Green Star buildings (accredited under 
the Australian Green Building Council) 
within 12 months. Other office buildings across AECOM’s 
global operations have also attained 
green building accreditation under  
the LEED and BREEAM schemes.  
Many of our offices are in commercial, 
downtown locations. Where possible, 
these are chosen so there are public-
transport networks available to service 
the commuting needs of employees. 
While the regional and global nature  
of our work means that employees  
often have to travel by air to visit 
clients and project sites, AECOM 
encourages the reduction of air travel 
through the use of teleconferencing 
and videoconferencing facilities.
Employee engagement is a crucial 
element in embedding sustainability 
across the global AECOM business. In 
each geography there are opportunities 
for employees to provide feedback on 
current sustainability initiatives, and  
to suggest new initiatives.
Our GO! teams continually devise  
new and innovative ways to advance  
our GO! program. A sustainability-
focused survey, for example, was 
conducted at the Leadership 
Development Conference in Hong 
Kong in June 2010, with results used 
to present recommendations for the 
development of sustainability across 
AECOM during 2011. An employee 
sustainability competition was also 
launched in Asia, allowing employees  
to put creative ideas into action.  
Several entries were adopted 
throughout regional AECOM offices. 
From increasingly standard initiatives, 
such as providing recycling facilities 
throughout offices, to more interesting 
programs, such as the many worm 
farms that help reduce organic waste 
in a number of our offices, AECOM 
approaches sustainability internally 
with the same drive and passion as  
we do externally for our clients.Greening our operations

A successful tomorrow depends upon 
making the right decisions today. 
AECOM understands that continued 
economic success is intrinsically 
linked with creating social and human 
value, and with protecting the Earth’s 
natural systems. If we are to ensure 
the continued success of AECOM, our 
shareholders and our clients, we cannot 
sacrifice long-term value creation for 
short-term returns: the two ideas must 
be mutually reinforcing.
For this reason, we are seeking 
ways to help our clients become 
more successful by conducting 
their business more sustainably. It 
is as much about how we frame the 
questions as it is about what we 
do. AECOM’s great strength lies in 
our diversity, and we are striving to 
organize ourselves to draw upon our 
deep knowledge across geographies, 
markets, and technical expertise 
to broaden the number of things we 
examine before we make a choice. 
Every intersection provides the 
opportunity to consider not just profit 
but also value creation, risk mitigation 
and opportunities for future success.
As a business, we describe our operation 
as a global services platform, ranging 
from front-end design and engineering to 
construction management, operations 
and maintenance. 
We have positioned the company for 
profitable growth. As we continue 
to gain market share in high-growth sectors of the U.S. market, we are also 
expanding in emerging and natural-
resource markets toward 50 percent of 
the business. Sustainable development 
of emerging economies and the 
sustainable use of resources are 
therefore pivotal to AECOM’s future.
We are also expanding services across 
this global platform and providing more 
higher-margin services. As we do so, 
we will also introduce cost efficiencies; 
for example, through maximizing 
economies of scale achieved by 
integration of AECOM, and through 
real estate consolidation. These cost 
efficiencies are often associated with 
reduced environmental impacts, such 
as consolidating into more energy-
efficient accommodation.
Integrated delivery of projects is 
taking on greater importance. We 
are expanding our construction 
management and program 
management capabilities to gain 
greater access to this growing market, 
including public –private partnerships 
and joint ventures. In our experience, 
integrated delivery and partnerships 
with the public sector offer some of the 
best opportunities to jointly develop 
and implement sustainable solutions.
AECOM will continue its successful 
balanced growth strategy and 
geographic- and service-offering 
diversification, focusing on emerging 
markets and energy-related end markets.Historical AECOM revenue

Global airline in-flight recycling 
United States
Decreasing disposal costs of on-board-
generated waste was a priority for this 
airline. AECOM completed a recycling 
feasibility study and implemented new 
recycling procedures and training in 
more than 30 locations across the U.S. 
Since the program’s inception in 2007, 
over 2,000 tons of material have been 
diverted from landfills. In addition, 
recycling rebates from the program 
were donated to Habitat for Humanity 
to fund construction of homes 
throughout the U.S. The program 
established the airline as the first 
major U.S.-based carrier to implement 
a comprehensive recycling program, 
and has been recognized by the EPA, 
CNN and other news forums for its 
environmental initiatives. AECOM also 
assisted the airline with the opening 
of an employee recycling center at its 
global headquarters.2

Authority (URA) wanted to maximize the 
sustainability performance of its 890-
acre Jurong Lake District development. 
AECOM utilized its planning and 
evaluation tool — the Sustainable 
Systems Integration Model™ — to 
holistically assess the environmental, 
economic and social systems of the 
project. As a result, URA was able to 
determine an optimal sustainable 
development plan for the district, and 
determine the most cost-effective 
strategies for integrating sustainable 
transportation, energy savings, 
water conservation and ecological 
preservation within urban areas.

SunRun solar study 
California, United States
The continued growth of California’s 
solar market depends on a streamlined 
solar permitting process. AECOM 
identified US$5 billion in potential 
economic activity from a new permitting 
regime that would invigorate California’s 
green economy and reduce its 
dependence on carbon-intensive energy.

Norman Creek Catchment vision and concept plan 
Brisbane, Australia
This heavily urbanized catchment 
required a new vision to guide its 
transformation into a place that 
sustainably manages its water and 
improves the health and resilience of 
its waterways. AECOM consulted with 
local residents, business owners and 
community groups to identify four 
objectives, including the delivery of a 
healthy ecosystem, improved recreation 
and activity opportunities, designing 
and living with Brisbane’s climate, 
and the strengthening of community 
connections. In line with these 
objectives, a plan was developed for the 
future transformation of the catchment.

As a Core Value, safety is an integral  
part of everything we do at AECOM. 
Whether our employees are on site,  
in the office, in transit or at home,  
the prevention of injuries to people — 
and damage to facilities, property, 
equipment and the environment —  
is the highest priority for us. Across 
offices, regions and geographies,  
our SH&E teams encourage our  
employees to embrace a safety  
culture both in and outside the office. 
Dedicated SH&E teams are  
responsible for implementing  
respective SH&E programs and 
supporting the use of SH&E tools 
that both educate AECOM employees 
about safety, and empower them 
to take assertive, safe action if and 
when necessary. Some of these 
tools include the behavioral program 
“Safety for Life,” online training 
needs assessments, online training 
management systems, online Safe 
Work Method Statements (SWMS), 
and the positive incentive reward 
card, which recognizes and rewards 
proactive safety behavior.
Our Step Back card — a field-level 
risk assessment tool — encourages 
employees to look and see potential 
hazards, to assess the risks and to  
take appropriate action. Our Stop  
Work directive, meanwhile, allows 
employees to cease work if they feel 
unsafe or sense an unacceptable risk. 
Comprehensive travel management 
plans are also used to ensure the safety 
of our employees when they are traveling 
internationally, and monthly reports are 
completed on a range of both leading 
and lagging safety indicators, with 
results used to continually improve our 
safety performance.Our safety practices
Gary Beswick, vice president, Safety, 
Health & Environment (standing), 
leads AECOM’s global efforts to 
provide our employees with the 
direction and support necessary to 
prevent injuries and illnesses, protect 
the environment and establish a 
universal AECOM SH&E culture.30 AECOM
Today’s megatrends of climate change, 
population growth and urbanization  
add a complexity and uncertainty we 
have never faced before. However, 
people are inventive, imaginative 
and diverse. Our ability to analyze, 
problem-solve and create is the 
resource that will make the difference 
between whether we succeed or fail.
For AECOM, this means supporting  
the creation of healthy human 
environments where education and 
training in the skill sets of the future  
can flourish — not only within our  
own organization but also as we help 
shape and develop urban environments 
around the world.
Our experienced employees and 
management are our most valuable 
resources. Attracting and retaining 
key personnel will remain critical 
to our success. We will continue to 
provide training and other personal 
and professional growth opportunities, 
performance-based incentives, 
opportunities for stock ownership,  
and other competitive benefits in order 
to strengthen our human capital base. 
Working in a global company across 
geographical, lingual and cultural 
divides is an exciting challenge. With 
employees in more than 130 countries, 
we recognize our commitment to 
sustaining a diverse and inclusive 
environment is paramount to our 
continued global success. Our labor practices and diversity
At AECOM, diversity is embedded in  
our Core Values. The diversity of 
our staff brings new ideas and 
perspectives to the forefront, which 
contributes to AECOM’s industry 
leadership. Incorporating the tenets 
of diversity and inclusion into every 
aspect of our business is central to 
driving innovation and expanding 
and enhancing the overall AECOM 
experience for our employees,  
clients and stakeholders. 
Our goal is to recruit, engage and 
develop outstanding people from  
a wide range of backgrounds. This 
mosaic, in turn, makes AECOM an 
adaptable business partner that 
understands, and responds to, the 
needs of the clients and communities 
that we serve.
Diversity expresses itself in many 
different ways — age, gender, race, 
nationality, language, culture,  
marital status, sexual orientation, 
religion, belief or creed, education, 
disability, personality, experiences,  
and approaches to work. We strive  
to maximize the potential of our 
employees by harnessing these 
differences and creating a productive, 
inclusive environment in which  
everyone feels respected and valued, 
where their talents are fully used, and  
in which company goals are achieved.
For example, we have created the  
Global Women’s Council, which 
focuses on improving the retention, 
development and advancement of 
women across AECOM. With employees  
in more than  
130 countries, 
we recognize our 
commitment to 
sustaining a diverse 
and inclusive 
environment is 
paramount to our 
continued global 
success.Our 2011 Sustainability Report 31
Teuila Hanson, vice president,  
Diversity + Inclusion, oversees 
AECOM’s global diversity and 
inclusion programs and initiatives.
AECOM promotes an environment  
free from discrimination and 
harassment, and is committed to 
ensuring equal opportunities in all  
areas of employment, including 
recruitment, hiring, training and 
promotion. AECOM strives to ensure  
all employment practices are objective 
and free from bias, are based solely 
upon work criteria and individual  
merit, and meet the broader goals  
and objectives of the company.
Further, it is AECOM’s policy to  
provide and maintain a productive 
atmosphere that is characterized  
by mutual respect. The company 
prohibits actions that are unlawful  
or inappropriate in the workplace. 
Our Good Working Relationship 
policy prohibits any conduct that is 
consistent with discrimination, sexual 
harassment, workplace harassment, 
victimization, bullying or vilification.Our officers, management and 
supervisors at all levels are  
responsible for ensuring that the  
spirit and intent of this policy is 
consistently practiced. Moreover,  
each employee has the responsibility  
to treat every colleague or applicant  
for employment with respect and in a 
fair, non-discriminatory manner. 32 AECOM

The Apex building 
Suffolk, United Kingdom 
The local council wanted to  
reinvigorate the town’s old Cattle 
Market site through a new mixed-use 
development. This included a flexible-
use public auditorium, for which 
AECOM provided building engineering 
and associated services that helped 
to deliver an innovative building that 
takes advantage of local environmental 
features to minimize energy use. 
The building is heated and cooled 
entirely by ground-source heat pumps, 
resulting in the carbon footprint of 
the building’s systems being less 
than half that of a similar building 
powered principally by electricity and 
gas. This functional and commercially 
successful venue is now providing an 
economic boost for the town.2
Deephams wastewater treatment plant 
Edmonton, United Kingdom 
This North London plant, which serves 
nearly one million people, required 
upgrading to provide additional capacity 
to deal with both storm-sewer flows 
and additional screening of sewage. 
AECOM designed a new sewage 
pumping station, inlet works, elevated 
screening and grit-removal structures 
and storm tanks to treat and contain 
storm-sewage flows and hence reduce 
sewage overflows. These integrated 
solutions will improve water quality  
in the River Lea and downstream, 
through London’s Olympic Games site.

Laos
Laos is highly dependent on 
agriculture yet vulnerable to climate 
change impacts, making good 
water management crucial to the 
population’s livelihood. 
AECOM is helping the country manage 
its natural resources more effectively, 
by increasing the climate resilience of 
government plans, policies, programs 
and projects — thereby reducing the 
vulnerability of local communities to 
climate change.Our 2011 Sustainability Report 33
The Victorian Department of 
Transport (DoT) wanted a rating 
tool to enable it to drive, measure 
and procure environmental 
sustainability in rail infrastructure 
development projects.  AECOM 
developed the Passenger Rail 
Environmental Sustainability 
Assessment Tool while delivering 
the main component of the 
extension of the Epping rail corridor 
to South Morang, a crucial upgrade 
and expansion of Melbourne’s 
public transportation network.
As part of an alliance, AECOM 
was the main rail and civil 
designer, and was supported by 
our environmental, geotechnical, 
planning and approvals, 
landscape design, and community 
consultation specialists. The tool, 
endorsed by the Australian Green 
Infrastructure Council, allows 
the first sustainability rating 
for a rail project in Victoria.  It 
now enables the DoT to set new 
standards regarding environmental 
sustainability, judge the 
achievement levels of projects, and 
assess future tenders on a value for 
money and “like-for-like” basis.South Morang rail extension

In 2011, AECOM donated nearly  
US$4 million dollars to charitable 
causes, including disaster relief, 
education and environmental needs. 
Our web site features a global map 
spotlighting a selection of our social 
responsibility efforts. 
The efforts we have highlighted  
include:
 - partnering with the Maasai 
Wilderness Conservation Trust 
in Kenya, providing an evolving 
pro bono program of professional 
services
 - matching employee donations to  
the Red Cross for the Japan 
earthquake and tsunami 
 - supporting the United Kingdom’s 
Construction Industry Charity for  
the Homeless (CRASH)
 - donating computers to local 
community outreach organizations  
in Southern Los Angeles, California
 - taking part in Clean Up United Arab 
Emirates, joining 15,000 volunteers 
who removed 73 tons of rubbish.Product responsibility and quality
Our reputation is tied to our ability to 
deliver quality, consistent results for our 
clients. AECOM has adopted a Project 
Delivery System (PDS) that is tailored to 
our capabilities and geographies. 
The diagram above illustrates our PDS, 
which is integral to our integrated 
business management systems 
that align with the ISO 9001 quality 
standard. In fact, almost all of our 
geographies are ISO 9001 certified.
Safety in design
Our “Safety in Design” process 
identifies potential dangers in projects 
throughout their lifecycles, and 
provides a comprehensive framework 
to avoid or minimize risk and enhance 
safety, while maintaining functionality.
This process involves communication 
with our clients and stakeholders, 
application of “Safety in Design” 
principles, compliance with standards, 
documentation, and the use of methods 
such as independent peer review.Our product and social responsibility
