www.gazprom-neft.com GAZPROM NEFT 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTABOUT THE REPORTGazprom Neft had a successful year in 2014. The Company continued 
to enjoy stable production growth, achieving a 6% improvement in extraction and a 2% increase in refining activity. Gazprom Neft remains the industry leader in average daily sales of petroleum products at filling stations. Highlights of the year include ship-to-shore delivery of the first oil from our offshore Arctic fields at Prirazlomnoye in the Pechora Sea and Novy Port in the northern Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District; the use of new technologies in the Company’s traditional operating areas to boost output from existing fields, and the beginning of the latest stage in the upgrade of refining facilities to increase efficiency. Last year, Gazprom Neft became a leading supplier of modern bitumen materials.
Despite the economic headwinds, Gazprom Neft pushed forward with 
strategic plans to develop the Arctic shelf, enter new markets, work with hard-to-recover reserves, and conduct a study of the unconventional hydrocarbon reserves of the Bazhenov Formation. The Company believes that investing in technology and innovation is essential to maintaining a competitive advantage over other market players during the coming years. In developing and implementing our business strategy, we strive to achieve a careful balance of economic, environmental, and social interests.Upstream production carries with it a great responsibility, which is why the company consistently acts as a steward of the environment and natural resources. One important project in this regard is our effort to utilize associated petroleum gas. Gazprom Neft continues to invest heavily in promoting efficient use of this former waste product. In 2014, this included construction of a new gas processing facility at the Yuzhno-Priobskaya compressor station and commissioning new compressor stations at the Yety-Purovskoye field and in Tomsk Region. Gazprom Neft continues to pay close attention to environmental and workplace safety at the Prirazlomnoye field. The Company implements industry best practices and leading technologies in order to preserve the unique Arctic environment, and is active in its work with business partners, public organizations, and experts to pioneer solutions in this area.
Staff development is another strategic priority. Our success as 
a company in the current economy is testament to the Gazprom Neft team and its professionalism and skill. 
In 2015, there will be new challenges for the entire industry, and we are 
no exception. Nevertheless, with its committed workforce and strategic depth, Gazprom Neft continues to achieve its goals.Gazprom Neft is committed to sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. 
An important part of this is the Company’s policy of giving back to the communities in which it operates as a major taxpayer, employer, and partner for local and regional governments. Our contribution is more than just financial: we aim to improve quality of life and strengthen social infrastructure in the communities that Company employees and their families call home. 
ALEXEY MILLER
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
OF GAZPROM NEFTMESSAGE FROM 
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS5www.gazprom-ne/ft.com GAZPROM NEFT 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTIn addition, Gazprom Neft makes a significant contribution to the social and economic 
development of the regions in which it operates. To more effectively address regional development, in 2013 Gazprom Neft initiated the Home Towns programme for holistic social investment. Home Towns promotes quality of life locally by expanding access to modern urban infrastructure as well as to educational and cultural opportunities. The programme helps to develop social and entrepreneurial initiatives among communities, creating the infrastructure that residents need to improve their lives.
By developing and implementing new approaches, combined with 
our growing experience in the field, the Company is making good on its commitments to sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. Major environmental safety and conservation projects in 2014 included the development of a fauna preservation programme for the south-eastern Barents Sea, a pilot green seismic exploration project that substantially reduced the need for logging compared with traditional methods, and emission reductions at the Company’s Moscow refinery. Substantially ahead of the deadline set by the Russian government, the Company has transitioned to the Euro 5 standard for environmentally friendly petrol. Thanks to refinery modernization and utilization of associated petroleum gas, in 2014 Gazprom Neft was able to cut gross emissions by more than 14% compared with 2013, and by 52% compared with 2012.
Gazprom Neft is constantly striving to improve safety in the workplace. 
Expenditure on occupational health and safety and environmental protection amounted to approximately RUB 22 billion in 2014 alone. We selectively source and implement the newest, safest technologies that offer the most value for our workforce and the environment. As a result, workplace incidents at production sites decreased by over 12% in 2014. The company’s strategic goal is to become the industry leader in workplace safety.Gazprom Neft’s most valuable asset is its people. That is why we take particular care to invest in staff development. We work to keep our employees motivated, engaged, and proficient in their field. Our approach is to employ the best specialists, provide them with good salaries, working conditions, and benefits, and give them everything they need to thrive and make the most of their creative potential. An important element of this is our work with students, recent graduates, and up-and-coming professionals, as we seek to nurture the next generation of Gazprom Neft employees. In 2014, the Company invested over RUB 60 billion in employee social support and development, exceeding the 2013 total by more than 26%.
We continue to move forward with the sustainability work begun 
in previous years. And with new social and environmental projects coming online, 2015 promises to be the most sustainable year yet for Gazprom Neft.
ALEXANDER DYUK OV 
CHAIRMAN OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD 
AND CEO OF GAZPROM NEFTMESSAGE FROM 
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD
The year 2014 proved to be highly eventful 
for Gazprom Neft. The Company sold the first oil from the Prirazlomnoye offshore field in the Russian Arctic shelf on the world market; began pumping at the Badra field in Iraq, and carried out summer ship-to-shore delivery from the Novy Port field in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. While development of refining assets continued apace, the Company also became a market leader in innovative bitumen materials. Gazprom Neft retained its industry-leading growth rate in hydrocarbon production and is developing the technology to get the most out of mature fields.
Given the global changes in the industry, it 
is difficult to overstate the importance of hard-to-recover reserves, non-traditional production, and the modernization of refinery infrastructure to improve efficiency and product quality. By rising to these challenges with new technologies and management approaches, we are laying the groundwork for continued stable growth in the years to come. 7www.gazprom-ne/ft.com GAZPROM NEFT 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTGazprom Neft, a subsidiary of Gazprom, is one of the 
largest and fastest-growing oil and gas companies in Russia. In accordance with the SPE (PRMS) classification, the Company's proven reserves of hydrocarbons total 1.443 billion TOE, placing Gazprom Neft among the 20 largest global oil producers.www.gazprom-ne/ft.com

MISSION AND STRATEGIC VISION
Gazprom Neft's operations are primarily informed by the Company's 2025 
Development Strategy, which was approved by the Board of Directors in 2013. In 2014, goals and objectives were specified for a number of business areas. The goals and objectives were updated to address local concerns; this process did not lead to a large-scale revision of the Development Strategy as a whole. Gazprom Neft’s exploration and production efforts currently remain focused on the effective development of a mature resource base and ensuring maximum return on investment from new projects. In refining and sales, the Company continues to concentrate on upgrading refining capacities and maximizing sales of petroleum products through the Company's own premium sales channels.USD 12.052 billion

ABOUT THE COMPANYECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
This reporting year was a challenging one for the entire oil and gas industry. 
The significant decline in global hydrocarbon prices had a major impact on the sector’s development. Gazprom Neft was able to meet the challenges of the changing macroeconomic environment and demonstrated steady growth in production figures: the Company secured an increase in reserves, production, and refining throughput, and also increased premium sales volumes. These results confirmed that the Company's chosen strategy, with a focus on stable growth and efficiency, was the right one. In 2015, Gazprom Neft will maintain its production growth rate and the high degree of efficiency in refinery operations, achieving the goals set out in the Company's 2025 Development Strategy.
OPERATIONAL RESULTS
During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft produced a total of 66.25 million TOE. 
In 2014, Gazprom Neft began deliveries of new Arctic oil grades to European consumers: ARCO 
from the Prirazlomnoye field and Novy Port from the Novoportovskoye field on the Yamal Peninsula.
Commercial production began at the Badra field in Iraq. This is the Company's largest foreign 
production project. The development of projects in Russia and internationally has allowed Gazprom Neft to achieve production growth of over 6%. At the end of 2014, Gazprom Neft's had 2.55 billion TOE in proven and probable reserves, an increase of more than 11% compared with 2013.
INNOVATIONS IN PRODUCTION
One of the Company's major focuses in 2014 was the introduction of new technologies to mature fields. 
New technologies led to production growth at assets which have been in operation for decades. 
These results were achieved by increasing the proportion of high-technology wells. Today, the Company holds a leading position in Russia’s oil and gas sector in this area.MODERNIZATION OF OIL REFINING ASSETS
The Company’s refining throughput increased by 1.99% for the year, amounting to 43.48 million tonnes.
Following completion of a quality programme and transition to the production of Euro 5-standard 
fuels, in 2014 Gazprom Neft launched the second phase of its oil refinery modernization programme to increase refining depth and the output of light petroleum products. 
GROWTH OF SALES CHANNELS
The Company continued to upgrade its tank farms, and actively developed premium sales channels for its petroleum products. In 2014, sales in high-margin market segments increased by 7.5%. 
Last year, the Company took a major step in the development of its bitumen business by creating 
a specialized operator: Gazpromneft – Bitumen Materials. In 2014, Gazprom Neft acquired the largest asset for the production of polymer-modified bitumen in Russia, Ryazan Petrochemical Experimental Plant, and began the production of new generation G-Way Styrelf bitumens at the Moscow Refinery in partnership with France’s Total. This has positioned Gazprom Neft as a market leader in modern bitumen materials.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Gazprom Neft paid out 25% of the Company’s net profit in interim dividends to its shareholders, according to IFRS. During the reporting year, the Company maintained its leading position in the industry for efficiency, and was the top Russian oil company in terms of return on invested capital.
An increase of 1.7% in adjusted EBITDA was constrained by the negative impact of a temporary 
export duty lag. The negative impact of the exchange rate resulting from the revaluation of loans reduced the profits attributable to Gazprom Neft shareholders for the reporting year by 31.4%.2.55 billion TOE  11%

Total production by Gazprom Neft increased by 6.41% in 2014, to 66.25 million TOE. The rise in 
production volumes was achieved through the acquisition of new production assets in 2011–2012 (Gazprom Neft Orenburg, High Technology Centre, Yuzhuralgaz, and Zhivoy Istok), through highly effective well interventions in West Siberian fields, and through increasing the ownership share in SeverEnergia.
Gazprom Neft is the only oil company in Russia which has been able to increase production volumes 
at mature fields in Western Siberia. Production increased in 2014 due to the implementation of a high-tech oil and gas reservoir development programme (Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegas, Gazprom Neft-Khantos) and the commencement of the development of 15 million tonnes of hard-to-recover reserves.
In 2014, the Company consolidated its position in the Russian northern seas to the north of the 
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. In April, a new grade of oil, ARCO, was shipped from the Prirazlomnoye field, Russia's first drilling project on the Arctic shelf. An exploratory well was drilled in the Dolginskoye field, located on the Arctic shelf of the Pechora Sea. A study of the well has also been completed. This is the first time such a considerable amount of work has been completed during the short ice-free season, and it sets a record for the industry. Preparations continue for the commercial development of the major fields to the north of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District: the Messoyakha group and Novoportovskoye. The first season of shipping oil by sea from the Novoportovskoye field is complete. 
In January 2015, Gazprom Neft obtained its first shale oil inflows at the South Priobskoye field in 
the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District – Yugra. The Company began commercial shipments of oil at the Badra field in Iraq, and delivered against its commitments to the Government of Iraq to produce no less than 15,000 barrels per day for 90 days. 
The Company is actively developing its gas operations based on the commercialization of its 
reserves of associated and natural gas extracted from oil fields, and increasing the value of this gas. Total gas production/utilization by the Gazprom Neft Group in 2014 (including share in production by joint ventures) was 17.68 billion m

ABOUT THE COMPANYREFINING 
In 2014, Gazprom Neft maintained its position as one of the leading Russian oil companies in terms 
of refining throughput. 
Refining throughput increased this year by 1.99% to 43.48 million tonnes. Following completion 
of a quality programme and transition to the production of Euro 5-standard fuels, in 2014 Gazprom Neft launched the second phase of its oil refinery modernization program to increase the refining depth and the output of light petroleum products. Gazprom Neft's largest refining asset, the Omsk Refinery, retained its absolute superiority in the industry in 2014 by refining 21.28 million tonnes of petroleum feedstock.SALES OF OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS
Gazprom Neft sells oil and petroleum products on a wholesale basis in Russia and abroad. Sales subsidiaries are responsible for small-scale wholesale and retail sales, including via the Company’s network of filling stations. In 2014, the Company actively scaled up its petroleum products sales business and continued to build a strong brand. In the future, the Company's priority will be organic growth based on improving operating efficiency.
As of the end of 2014, the Company’s petroleum product supply businesses operated 49 owned 
and leased tank farms. A total of 7.2 million tonnes of petroleum products were sold through small-scale wholesale channels in 2014. Large wholesale petroleum product sales reached 0.8 million tonnes in 2014.

OIL EXPORTS
During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft exported 9.63 million tonnes of oil in absolute terms, 
21.96% less than in 2013. This is due to the growth of the Company's own oil refining in Russia, the halt of oil sales to Kazakhstan, and a rise in sales of oil from the Orenburgskoye field on the domestic market.

ABOUT THE COMPANYRETAIL SALES
Gazprom Neft’s network of filling stations operates in 28 regions of Russia, as well as in the 
countries of the CIS and Eastern Europe. At the end of 2014, it comprised 1,810 filling stations, including 1,389 in Russia and the CIS. With one of the most extensive sales networks in Russia, Gazprom Neft further consolidated its position in the automotive fuel retail market in 2014, increasing its share in regional markets to 23.7%.
The Company’s filling stations sold 9.91 million tonnes of petroleum products in 2014 (9% more 
than 2013 sales). Average daily sales per filling station in the Russian Federation in 2014 were 20.0 tonnes, 5.26% higher than in 2013.
During the reporting period, Gazprom Neft continued to focus on sales of premium branded fuel 
at its filling stations. In 2014, the Company sold 509,000 tonnes of premium G-Drive 95 fuel and 57,000 tonnes of premium G-Drive 98 fuel. 
The company is continuing to rebrand its network of filling stations. Having its own national 
brand with a high level of market awareness and confidence in product quality helps the Company to achieve one of its strategic goals: to become a leading player in Russia and the CIS by 2025, in terms of retail sales volume and the productivity of its network of filling stations. In 2014, 578 filling stations were rebranded.SHIP BUNKERING
The Company’s Gazprom Neft Marine Bunker subsidiary handles sales of light and dark grades of marine fuel for sea- and river-going vessels. The Company currently has the broadest geographical reach of any bunkering operator in Russia: 20 marine and 13 river ports, as well as a developed terminal network, give the Company one of its strategic competitive advantages. The Company is a leader in the Russian bunkering market, with an 18.6% share.
AIRCRAFT REFUELLING
Gazprom Neft-Aero, a Gazprom Neft subsidiary, is engaged in small-scale wholesale and retail sales of jet fuel, as well as the provision of services for aircraft fuel and lubricant supply. Gazprom Neft-Aero is a leading aviation fuel retailer in Russia. It has the largest sales network among Russian vertically integrated oil companies, with 40 of its own refuelling facilities in Russia and the CIS. Since 2008, Gazprom Neft-Aero has been a strategic partner of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for the supply of aviation fuel. Gazprom Neft is the sole supplier of aviation fuel at 28 aerodromes owned by the Russian Ministry of Defence. Gazprom Neft is placing particular emphasis on expanding sales of natural gas vehicle fuel, mainly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG). These fuels can reduce the environmental impact of transport and make it more economical to use. These are particularly relevant concerns for municipal and commercial transport operators in large cities. This opens up opportunities for large-scale use of this type of fuel. A total of 10,000 tonnes of CNG and 98,000 tonnes of LPG (a total of 6% more than in 2013) were sold in 2014.SALES GROWTH
PREMIUM BUSINESS SEGMENTS
In order to improve performance in petroleum product sales, Gazprom Neft has a number of separate business divisions for the sale of jet fuel, lubricants, bitumen materials, petrochemicals, and ship bunkering. 
Individual strategic development plans have been developed by the Company for each segment.  
The prime objectives for these business units are increasing sales efficiency, expanding 
geographical reach, and increasing premium market share.
Total sales in premium segments in 2014 amounted to 25.78 million tonnes. The main growth areas 
are bunkering and sales of motor fuels, jet fuel, and lubricants. Sales of jet fuel increased due to an increase in the number of airports in Russia and abroad where the Company operates. Marine fuel sales volumes increased due to growth in the bunkering market in the Far East and the Black Sea, and the expansion of the Company's customer base at the Baltic ports.

In 2014, Omsk Lubricants Plant commissioned an automatic oil mixing station with a capacity of 180,000 tonnes per year. It also launched a new lubricants production site (5,000 tonnes per year). The new production plant is the largest in Russia in terms of total mixing and packaging capacity.NEW PRODUCTS “Since 2015, new ECA (Emission Control Area) requirements have come into force prescribing the use of more environmentally friendly fuels with a sulphur content not exceeding 0.1%. This has caused an increase in demand for low-sulphur fuels. In this regard, we are focusing on the development of a new market segment for bunkering LNG, and by 2025 we plan to have gained a firm foothold in this area.”

“The introduction of this new, cutting-edge 
production technique at the Omsk Lubricants Plant will enable Gazprom Neft to produce high-tech motor oils in Russia that are just as good as their Western equivalents, and to provide Russian consumers with top-quality products. At this new Russian site, we have applied all the experience that we have accumulated through managing our assets in other countries. The next major project that is planned at the Omsk Lubricants Plant for 2018 is the start of production of basic oils with a high degree of purity. This will mean that we will no longer need to import raw materials in order to produce high-quality oils, and this will strengthen our position among competitors in Russia and the CIS.”

GAZPROM NEFT  2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
24 25ABOUT THE COMPANYBITUMINOUS MATERIALS
Gazprom Neft is one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of bitumen products. Sales of 
bitumen materials in 2014 reached 1.75 million tonnes. Gazprom Neft increased sales of premium bitumen products by 16,000 tonnes to 42,000 tonnes. In order to strengthen its leading position on the bitumen materials market during the reporting year, the Company established a subsidiary to manage its bitumen business: Gazpromneft – Bitumen Materials, which will bring together all business management functions for the Company's bitumen operations. 
The new company’s main role is to implement Gazprom Neft's long-term bitumen business strategy, 
which aims to improve asset management efficiency, achieve a leading position in Russia in terms of the application of cutting-edge technology, and develop promising business areas.
During the reporting year, the Moscow Refinery began trial operations at Russia's first facility for 
the production of a new generation of polymer-modified bitumens (PMBs), to be marketed under the G-Way Styrelf brand name. The plant, constructed by a joint venture between Gazprom Neft and France’s Total, is designed to produce 60,000 tonnes of PMBs and 7,000 tonnes of bitumen emulsions per year. 
The integration of Ryazan Experimental Petrochemicals Plant, which was acquired in 2013 (during 
the reporting year it was renamed Gazprom Neft – Ryazan Bitumen Binders Plant) has enabled Gazprom Neft to assume a leading position on the Russian market for modern bitumen materials. Today, the Ryazan Bitumen Binders Plant is the largest site in Russia for the production of polymer-modified bitumen binders and bitumen emulsions, and is a future-orientated enterprise equipped with the latest facilities. The plant has the capacity to produce up to 300 tonnes of polymer-modified bitumen binders and bitumen emulsions per day and up to 60,000 tonnes per year. In October 2014, Rosavtodor, SI
BUR, and Gazprom Neft signed 
a cooperation agreement at the Road International Exhibition and Forum. In December, the companies adopted an action plan for 2015–2016 under the agreement to promote the use of modern materials in the road industry and improve the quality and longevity of Russian roads.

PETROCHEMICALS
Gazprom Neft is Russia's largest producer of a range of basic petrochemical products: aromatic 
hydrocarbons (benzene, paraxylene, orthoxylene, toluene) and the propane-propylene fraction (propylene liquefied petroleum gas). The Company's share of Russia’s total consumption of aromatic hydrocarbons in 2014 was 17%, while its share of exports was 32%.
The target niches of the Company's petrochemical business are basic products and derivatives. 
In order to generate additional revenue from refining products from its own raw materials (oil and gas refining), Gazprom Neft plans to increase the degree of refining of basic petrochemical products by upgrading its existing refinery capacities and implementing major investment projects to build large-scale production facilities.
Sales of aromatic hydrocarbons produced by the Company in 2014 reached 391,000 tonnes, 
of which 302,000 tonnes were sold on the domestic market.INNOVATIONS IN HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION
In 2014, Gazprom Neft finalized its technological strategy for exploration and production. To ensure the effective implementation of the strategy in each core upstream business unit, staff have been identified to take charge of the technological development of each particular area.42,000  tonnes

ABOUT THE COMPANYALKALINE-SURFACTANT-POLYMER (ASP) FLOODING 
ASP has the potential to increase oil yield by a process of chemically flooding a reservoir with 
a ternary mixture (consisting of anionic surfactant polymers, soda, and polymer). The oil recovery rate can be increased by pumping a combination of chemicals into the well. It is expected that ASP flooding will be widely used in the fields of Western Siberia, and the oil extraction ratio can be improved by 8–25%. 
In 2014, wells were drilled as part of a pilot project to apply chemical flooding using a ternary ASP 
mixture (soda, surfactant, and polymer) in the Salym group of fields. Equipment for pumping the mixture into the formation was also delivered. Pilot pumping is planned for the second half of 2015. At the end of the pilot stage, the effectiveness of the technology will be analysed and the feasibility of its implementation on an industrial scale will be assessed. 
DRILLING OF SUPER-LONG HORIZONTAL WELLS
This technology makes it possible to significantly increase the oil recovery rate, which is especially relevant for mature fields. In 2014, the first Russian oil well with a horizontal shaft of more than 1,500 m and a total length of about 4,200 m was drilled on the Yamal Peninsula. 
INTRODUCTION OF WIRELESS SEISMIC SURVEY TECHNOLOGIES IN RUSSIA
In 2014, the Company implemented the first seismic survey project in Russia using innovative wireless seismic technology. The technology makes it possible to halve the required amount of deforestation compared with conventional seismic survey technologies. The pilot project demonstrated that by using the new method, approximately 200 hectares of forest – or roughly 60,000 trees – are saved per 400 km
2.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GEOMATE INFORMATION SYSTEM
During the reporting year, the Company introduced its proprietary GeoMate information system using advanced technology to analyse geological and production data. The system takes into account the impact of more than 200 geological parameters and consolidates about 80% of all data available from the analysis of geological and geophysical information. Access to a single information environment enables employees in different departments at Gazprom Neft to promptly examine all the available parameters for modelling fields and identifying and detailing potential zones and reservoirs. Comprehensive analysis of this information helps geologists, geophysicists, petrophysicists, and specialists in other areas to develop integrated solutions in field prospecting and development, drawing on a wide range of data. The creation of in-house software frees the Company from dependence on similar imported products."Gazprom Neft’s strategic plans include the development of a new production site in Eastern Siberia. A distinctive feature of the entire region is that so far it has been poorly geologically surveyed. Therefore, the new, accurate data that we are obtaining through the application and combination of various advanced exploration methods will help create the most effective model for the development of these fields, and in a few years we will be able to start commercial oil production.”
VADIM YAKOVLEV
GAZPROM NEFT FIRST DEPUTY CEOINNOVATIONS IN OIL REFINING  
AND PETROCHEMISTRY
In 2014, the Company's refineries implemented projects to manufacture new types of products and reduce the environmental impact of production.
DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF PROPRIETARY REFINING CATALYST 
TECHNOLOGIES
In 2014, the Moscow Refinery switched to using the M grade cracking catalyst developed and 
manufactured at the Omsk Refinery, thereby replacing the imported catalyst that had been previously used. Currently, all of the catalytic cracking facilities at the Moscow and Omsk refineries use catalysts produced by Gazprom Neft. 
Baseline data (from years of research in collaboration with leading scientific institutions) is being 
collated for the Construction of the Catalyst Production Facility at Omsk Refinery feasibility study. The planned production facility is capable of meeting all the Company's needs for high-performance catalysts in line with its key oil refining processes, freeing the Company from critical dependence on foreign suppliers. 
As part of research and development of proprietary technologies and innovative products, the 
Company has designed: an oligomerization catalyst producing a higher yield of the target product (petrol component) than even the best analogues; a  catalyst for hydrotreatment of petrol obtained by catalytic cracking, which is able to yield a high-octane component for Euro-5 fuel; a high-performance catalyst (hydrogenative and ring opening) for refining secondary distillates into quality diesel fuel; an isodewaxing catalyst for the production of Arctic diesel fuel; and a catalytic cracking catalyst producing a high yield of olefins (a valuable petrochemical feedstock).
In 2014, the Company obtained seven Russian Federation patents for inventions resulting from its 
own developments, and registered seven patent applications for inventions. 
PRODUCTION OF POLYMER-MODIFIED BITUMEN
Gazprom Neft–Total PMB (a joint venture between Gazprom Neft and France’s Total) began production of polymer-modified bitumen under the brand name G-Way Styrelf. This is a new-generation product that has no analogues on the Russian polymer-bitumen binder market. Consumers can now purchase a polymer-modified bitumen that has none of the drawbacks that are commonly found in other Russian products: G-Way Styrelf does not flake during transport, and has properties that change very little during prolonged storage.
CRYOGENIC TECHNOLOGY FOR PRODUCING NITROGEN
Gazprom Neft's Moscow and Omsk refineries have completely switched to a cryogenic technology for producing the nitrogen used in oil refining for technological needs. This technology reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 32% at the Omsk Refinery and by 28% at the Moscow Refinery. Previously, natural gas had to be burned in order to obtain nitrogen, creating carbon dioxide as a byproduct. The new eco-friendly method separates nitrogen from the air at ultra-low temperatures. The purity of the gas is close to 100%. This makes it possible to expand the scope of its use, especially in processes which have higher requirements in terms of the quality of the gas.In 2014, Gazprom Neft completed electrical prospecting of an area of 600 km
2 in the Tympuchikansky and 
Vakunaysky blocks in Eastern Siberia. The completed project represents the most extensive research in the world undertaken using electrical prospecting, namely the near-field transient electromagnetic (TEM) method. A record number of physical TEM sensors (more than 7,600) were used, and the volume of data obtained as well as the duration of the work (from December 2013) were also unprecedented. Through the observations, a significant amount of new geological information about the Tympuchikansky and Vakunaysky sites has been obtained. The findings of the study in combination with seismic data make it possible to create a more accurate picture of the geological structure of the sites.ELECTRICAL PROSPECTING95%

In 2014, Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegas launched an innovative facility for the thermal 
destruction of oil sludge at the Vyngapurovskoye field. The sludge can now be processed without waste. 
The sludge is decomposed at a high temperature in an oxygen-free environment into its component 
parts: oil, water, and mechanical impurities (clay, sand, and metal oxides). The oil produced during the process is completely ready for transport and sale. The resulting water can be used without any additional purification. The mechanical impurities extracted include cleaned subsoil which can be used as a building material in road construction or as backfill in the foundations of well pads. Associated petroleum gas (APG), which is separated during sludge processing, is used to power the facility. Processing is carried out without releasing the products of combustion into the atmosphere.

Risk management is one of the essential components of sustainability 
management. The Company has a Risk Management Policy that defines risk management goals, objectives and principles to improve the Company's guarantee of reliability over the short and long terms.
RISK MANAGEMENT  
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The Company's goal is to improve management decisions by analysing the risks associated with 
such decisions and ensuring maximum efficiency of risk management activities when implementing these decisions.
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Company has developed and implemented a uniform approach to the risk management process, which is fully set out in the Integrated Risk Management System (IRMS) corporate standard. Gazprom Neft’s IRMS is a continuous and systematic process for identifying, assessing, and managing risk. As of the end of 2014, the IRMS covered all of Gazprom Neft’s significant assets. A further expansion of the system is planned as new projects are launched or operating assets are acquired.
1
During the reporting year, the Company's risk assessment process was integrated with business planning and project management. The Company's business plans for 2013–2015 reassessed existing assessments and descriptions of risk factors at the subsidiary level in view of changing conditions and new plans. Information about the most significant risks at subsidiaries and affiliates and measures to mitigate them were included in the relevant business plans. In addition, during the reporting year, the Company implemented a methodology for the analysis of project risks that was developed in 2013. At the same time, risk sessions aimed at identifying risks associated with the management of large Company projects were held. As a result, it is now possible to create project plans that strike a balance between goals set and degrees of uncertainty (risk).
The risk management system encompasses social and environmental risks in addition to financial 
and operational risks. It also includes risks associated with human resources and industrial and environmental safety. promoting a culture of risk ma

The Company attaches great importance to maintaining a high level of business ethics and 
conscientious business practices.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTRisk description Risk management measures
RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN RESOURCES
The Group's business depends on essential, highly qualified staff. A lack 
of qualified personnel, particularly in engineering and technology, may increase the risks associated with staff shortages. The Group's success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of essential employees, including qualified technical personnel, as well as on the Group's ability to attract and retain such staff. Competition for staff in Russia and abroad may be exacerbated by the limited number of qualified professionals on the labour market. An inability to attract new qualified personnel and/or maintain current staffing levels could have an adverse effect on the Group's appeal as an employer. The demand for qualified staff and the costs associated with employing such staff are expected to continue to grow, reflecting the strong interest in these employees from other industries and public projects.The Group offers competitive remuneration, including a salary, performance-based bonuses, and a social benefits package. 
The Company is developing and operating a talent pool and employee 
training and development programmes aimed at meeting the Company’s needs for qualified staff both now and in the future. 
The Group is improving its recruitment procedures and taking measures 
to reduce staff turnover and encourage staff to realize their potential. 
RISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRIAL SAFETY
The Group is exposed to risks relating to the safety of its employees and 
their operations. The Group's main business could be adversely affected by many factors, including equipment damage and failure, labour disputes, natural disasters, political disputes, and terrorist attacks. Any of these risks could have a materially adverse effect on the Group's business, financial situation, and operating results.As part of risk prevention, the Group strives to provide a safe working environment for its employees, seeking to avoid injury or death, as well as actions brought against the Group or damage to its business reputation. The Company constantly monitors safety threats, and pays particular attention to complying with safety equipment regulations.
ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
Gazprom Neft’s operations carry an inherent risk of environmental 
damage or pollution, which may lead to civil liability and require action to mitigate such damage. The Company is fully aware of its responsibility to the public for creating safe working conditions and protecting the natural environment. Gazprom Neft constantly monitors its operations to ensure compliance with applicable environmental standards, and implements environmental protection programmes. In the future, the costs associated with environmental compliance and obligations may increase.Gazprom Neft’s environmental protection policy is aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable environmental legislation by investing significant funds in environmental measures, including the use of technologies that minimize environmental impact. As a result, there has been a significant reduction in the likelihood of risks associated with environmental pollution. The Group also monitors changes in environmental legislation in the various countries in which it operates.Managing social and environmental risks STAKEHOLDER  
ENGAGEMENT 
Gazprom Neft maintains a continuous dialogue with all stakeholders, and 
considers this to be one of the main tools for implementing its sustainable development strategy. The Company pays particular attention to stakeholder interests which correspond not only with its own objectives and obligations, but also with the interests of society as a whole. Gazprom Neft aims to develop a balanced approach to stakeholder engagement that seeks to harmonize the interests of all stakeholders and achieve sustainable development goals. In conducting this dialogue, the Company strives to ensure maximum transparency of the information that it provides.
Gazprom Neft identifies a number of critical stakeholder groups, whose interests are most 
noticeably linked with its activities and who are able to exert the most significant impact on the Company's ability to implement its strategic goals:

PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATION: observance of business ethics; mutual responsibility; transparency 
and competitiveness in partner selection; common approach to achieving production objectives and product quality management.
The Company has a unified system for preparing, organizing, and conducting regulated procedures 
for selecting contractors to supply materials and equipment, and provide work and services to meet the needs of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Suppliers are selected purely on the basis of the procedures for selecting contractors.
The approaches used ensure:
 maximum efficiency and effectiveness of procurements
 an optimal level of competition between potential bidders
 an objective, well-founded, and impartial process for selecting the winning bidders
 reasonable openness in the tender procedures
The Company's procurement policy is designed for working mainly with the manufacturers of goods 
and providers of work and services, and with the official representatives of those suppliers.
The competitive selection process for contractors who supply materials and equipment and provide 
work and services for businesses within Gazprom Neft Group involves a comparative assessment of multiple bids in accordance with the requirements and standards of the Company’s internal regulations.
One of the most important selection criteria for suppliers and contractors is compliance with the 
Company’s health, safety, and the environment, occupational safety, and civil defence (HSE, OS, and CD) requirements.
The Company has implemented a standard in this area, the Procedure for Managing Contractors 
and Cooperative Arrangements in the Field of HSE, OS, and CD. All contractors who provide services to the Company sign an HSE, OS, and CD agreement that stipulates mandatory compliance with the Company's industrial and environmental safety standards.
Gazprom Neft procures an average of 95% of its annual essential material and equipment needs 
from the domestic market. CUSTOMERS 
PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATION: observance of business ethics; reliable and stable supply; continuous improvement of service.
The Company has a system in place for responding to customer dissatisfaction with the quality 
of products or services. Gazprom Neft’s mechanism for resolving these complaints is based on the corporate document: Guidelines for Handling Nonconformities when Selling Oil Products, LPG, and Associated Goods & Services at Filling Stations. Gazprom Neft regularly reviews customer requirements and satisfaction levels.
The Company implements programmes aimed at increasing the quality and environmental safety of 
products in accordance with international standards, and it communicates responsible marketing information to customers.
Conferences are important mechanisms used by the Company to communicate with customers and 
distributors. In 2014, Gazprom Neft-Lubricants organized its fourth international conference for distributors. The aim of this annual event is to review results, set goals for the future, and acquaint participants with the Company's marketing activities. The 2014 conference brought together more than 200 representatives of independent Russian and international companies that sell oil and lubricants under the following Company brands: G-Energy, G-Profi, and Gazprom Neft. In addition, during the reporting year the Company organized its fifth conference for distributors located in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.
Gazprom Neft regularly organizes off-site conferences and familiarization trips for customers, 
where potential and existing clients can see the production process, study the products in detail, and discuss topical issues.
In 2014, the Company held an off-site conference for Gazprom Neft’s Bitumens Department in 
Rome. Representatives from Gazprom Neft-Lubricants, the Russian Federal Road Agency and the directors of the country’s major road-building organizations, including the Alliance of Road Builders and Suppliers and the Road Construction Centre. The event was held to mark the launch of G-Way Styrelf premium bitumen, made using Total technology at the Moscow Refinery. During the meeting, customers were informed of the properties of the Company's bitumen materials and lubricants, and visited Total's polymer-bitumen binder production site and the lubricants plant.
Also in 2014, a delegation from the Middle East and Africa paid a fact-finding visit to the Company's 
main production site in Russia: the Omsk Lubricants Plant. Members of the delegation included representatives from the exclusive distributor Saskim Petrol, as well as strategic clients from Iraq and Egypt. The visit led to an agreement to introduce new products to meet the growing demand in the Middle Eastern and African markets.95%

Gazprom Neft is actively involved 
in import substitution programmes in various sectors of the business. In 2014, the Company made the decision to support domestic producers, all other things being equal. A list of alternative vendors who can meet Gazprom Neft’s requirements has been drafted and working groups have been set up to analyse the capabilities of both Russian and alternative markets. The Company has signed several strategic agreements with Russian companies for the key materials and equipment that are the most capital intensive. One of these areas is R&D into equipment for offshore projects. IMPORT SUBSTITUTION 
PROGRAMME 
Gazprom Neft has established a Technological Partnerships and Import Substitution 
Department. The new unit’s core objectives are to systematically monitor the Russian products and materials market in order to identify opportunities to replace imported products with Russian substitutes. In order to stimulate the import substitution process and achieve technological independence, the Company plans to work closely with manufacturers to develop new products and materials which Gazprom Neft will use in its business. It is expected that the result of these technological partnerships will be the localization of R&D projects essential to the oil industry, as well as the production of various goods capable of competing effectively with foreign counterparts in Russian and foreign markets.TECHNOLOGICAL PARTNERSHIPS AND IMPORT SUBSTITUTION DEPARTMENT"The conference provided us with an opportunity to get feedback from professionals.

chooses where to invest social funds based on dialogue with all stakeholders and monitoring of social wellbeing, which includes using data from the Company's own and independent studies.
The Company implements all social and charitable projects through the Home Towns social 
investment programme adopted in 2012. Gazprom Neft seeks to engage stakeholders in the implementation of this programme, seeing the social engagement of local communities as a basic condition for the sustainable regional development. An important mechanism for engaging local communities under this programme is the social initiatives grant competition introduced in 2013. Grant competitions were held in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District-Yugra, and Tomsk, Omsk, and Orenburg regions during the reporting year.
The Company actively engages stakeholders in dialogue. During the reporting year, the Company 
conducted round tables with representatives of local communities in two of the regions where it operates.

The Company believes that public hearings are an essential mechanism for the development and implementation of industrial projects. In 2014, the Company held a series of public hearings, including in the Tazovsky (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous) District regarding a project to move the boundaries of the Messo-Yakhinsky Nature Reserve. Exploration work could not be carried out in the Vostochno-Messoyakhsky area as its boundaries crossed those of the nature reserve, and the project aimed to solve this problem. As a result of multilateral dialogue between the Company, the regional administration, the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District environmental protection service, and public organizations, the boundaries of the reserve were moved to not only allow the oil company to explore the subsoil and meet its licence obligations to the state, but also to meet the nature reserve's main objective: to protect the Messoyakha riverbed.As a result of the project, the reserve will expand from 91,000 to 114,000 hectares, and the Messoyakha River will be protected and accessible for traditional natural resource use only. When counting votes, the opinions of both participants in public hearings in the regional administrative centre and residents of inter-settlement territories were taken into account. A survey of the nomadic population was conducted on the eve of the hearings by the regional branch of the Yamal Potemkam [Yamal for Our Descendants] Association of Indigenous Peoples. Following the voting and hearings, the project to move the boundaries of the nature reserve was approved.

PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS
PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATION: partnership in solving the challenges of environmental protection 
and regional development; disclosure of information and transparency.
The Company works actively with public organizations, hiring representatives of these 
organizations as experts when implementing environmental and social projects. 
Gazprom Neft encourages public organizations to participate in its social investment programme. 
The Company's social initiatives grant competition aims to involve this group of stakeholders in solving social and economic challenges, and in developing the professional competencies of local public organizations. 
In 2014, the Company actively developed cooperation with public organizations to protect the 
Arctic environment. During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft signed a collaboration agreement with the Association of Polar Explorers. This cooperation aims to develop and implement environmental protection programmes in polar regions. The Company contributed to preparations for the scientific expedition of the Association of Russian Polar Explorers and the Expedition Organization Fund of the Expeditionary Centre of the Russian Geographical Society based at Camp Barneo in the Arctic.MECHANISMS FOR COOPERATING WITH NORTHERN PEOPLES
Gazprom Neft businesses operate in areas inhabited by the 
indigenous peoples of northern Russia. The Company places special emphasis on striking a balance between implementing its strategic plans and safeguarding the interests of indigenous peoples. When planning its activities, the Company develops and discusses with representatives of the indigenous peoples ways to minimize the impact of its industrial activities on their traditional way of life. Gazprom Neft is implementing programmes to support the traditional lifestyles of the indigenous peoples of the north and preserve the unique Yamal culture, while helping them to adapt to the modern economic and social environment.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTCORPORATE CULTURE CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS 
Gazprom Neft considers its corporate culture to be an essential factor in 
achieving the Company's strategic objectives. In line with its Development Strategy, the Company is developing a corporate culture that seeks to help employees achieve excellence, based on Gazprom Neft’s mission and values.
The main elements in the development of this corporate culture include the management by 
objectives (MBO) system, the creation of internal economic competition, management by walking around,
1 top-down communication of values (from senior managers to subordinates) and the 
personal involvement of the Management Board in disseminating values, bottom-up promotion of initiatives, and the establishment of a feedback system. 
An important factor in the creation of a results-based culture is the Matrix Programme. The 
programme, which is being implemented in Gazprom Neft’s Upstream Division, aims to increase efficiency in order to achieve the Company's strategic goals by clearly setting out the powers and responsibilities of functional managers and company directors.
Proper communication at all levels of management is critical to the successful implementation of 
these changes. Target principles of behaviour and obligations to ensure compliance are enshrined in a declaration that was developed by the Top 100 Upstream managers. The principles include: synergy from working as a team, trust and transparency, discipline in complying with obligations, communications, and feedback.
In 2014, the Company began to introduce an organizational coaching system. The pilot project was 
launched at the Company's Corporate Headquarters. The project aims to provide coaching training (non-directive management and mentoring of employees) to managers at three levels: mentoring new employees, developing their own team, and coaching employees with high potential to fill the talent pool. Like the transformation of corporate culture, the coaching system is intended to enhance management efficiency and employee performance in accordance with the Company's strategic goals.
The Company places great emphasis on transmitting corporate values and accepted models of 
business conduct to new specialists. Employees who began working at the Company in 2014 are part of the Welcome programme, designed to engage specialists and help them to adapt effectively to working in the Company. The mentor, whose mission is to help employees understand the structure of the Company and to establish appropriate communications within the team, plays a critical role in this programme. The project will be launched at all Company subsidiaries over the next few years. In addition, a virtual tour of the Company (an interactive game that allows participants to learn about Gazprom Neft’s business processes) and the Stremitsya k bolshemu [Aiming for More] video game, which helps players understand the Company's business and corporate values, have been created for new employees. INTERNAL CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS
Internal communication channels ensure the development of Gazprom Neft’s corporate culture and the creation of an open communications space, providing employees at all levels with opportunities to show initiative and engage in dialogue.
The strategy for developing the internal corporate communications system adopted by the 
Company in 2010 aims to develop and localize communications tools, provide qualitative and substantive content for corporate media, and foster internal communications channels while taking into account the Company's strategic priorities and the information needs of its audience, ultimately impacting employee behaviour. 
The Company's internal communications tools include a corporate media system (Gazprom Neft 
company intranet portals, Siberian Oil corporate magazine, the Neftegazeta periodical and versions issued by subsidiaries, and corporate radio stations at Gazprom Neft-Aero and Omsk Refinery), meetings between managers and teams, TV panel systems, and discussion platforms (forums, conferences, and round tables). The Corporate Forum is a flagship event within the internal communications system. It is attended by representatives from across all of Gazprom Neft’s companies and employee groups. 
As a result of the introduction of a functional management model in 2014, there is a need for 
horizontal communications between employees in different enterprises performing similar roles. For this purpose, electronic communications platforms have been established within the existing corporate intranet portal, together with ways for users to post and moderate content.
Particular attention is paid to engaging employees in creating content to be posted on corporate 
media channels. To this end, the Company makes active use of interactive tools, such as discussions, competitions, and encouraging employees to write articles.
Every employee has the opportunity to convey their views to managers or to suggest ideas on how 
to increase productivity. For this, the Company uses tools such as a hotline and ‘Ask your Manager’ and ‘I have an idea’ sections on the intranet portal. There are also information kiosks for collecting feedback from employees who do not have access to a computer.
One of the main feedback tools is the annual corporate social and psychological study, covering 
all of the Company's assets. More than 10,000 Gazprom Neft employees took part in the study in 2014. By answering questions and participating in interviews and focus groups, employees are invited to express their views on a whole range of issues that affect core areas of their work, from workplace management and evaluations of the incentives system to opportunities for development and the effectiveness of social programmes. Separate indexes are compiled to show employee engagement. The data obtained from the study are used as the basis for staff management and communications planning, as well as to support management decisions. integrity

VALUES:
"Among other things, the Matrix 
Programme allows employees to act as a united team and negotiate with each other. We have much to change in our behavior, approaches, attitudes to each other, and communications with the Company. We must be clear that if even just one of us is not able to adapt to the new system, this will slow down the whole process." 
SERGEY DOKTOR
CEO, GAZPROM NEFT-KHANTOS
"The benefits of helping new employees to adapt are obvious: specialists become team members and achieve the required level of efficiency faster. Employees make fewer mistakes in their work and managers learn new competencies from the mentoring process, in addition to the other benefits."

The Company's main external communications objectives are to strengthen dialogue with external 
audiences, promote the Gazprom Neft brand, and provide information about its activities in the regions. The Company uses a wide range of tools and channels to communicate with external audiences. 
The Gazprom Neft Group websites, combined in a single, integrated system that gives increased 
access to information about the Group's activities to all interested parties, are the Company’s most important communications tool.
In 2014, the Gazprom Neft website published 148 official reports and 17 interviews given by 
Company managers to major Russian and international business and socio-political media outlets. Throughout the year, senior managers held regular press conferences and briefings where they were able to field questions from journalists about Gazprom Neft’s business, development plans, and operational results.
The main news items of the past year included: the development of major Company projects in new 
regions; the start of the second stage of refinery modernization, aimed at increasing refining depth and light product output, and the implementation of environmental programmes at Gazprom Neft enterprises. There was wide media coverage of the launch of Russia's first new-generation G-Way Styrelf polymer-modified bitumen plant at the Moscow Refinery.
There was a particular focus on information about the project to develop the Prirazlomnoye field 
in the Pechora Sea. Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the order for the first oil shipment from the Prirazlomnaya offshore ice-resistant rig in April 2014. A documentary about the Prirazlomnaya rig was shown on TV channel Russia 24. A special project was also launched with Kommersant newspaper Nasha Arktika [Our Arctic], dedicated to Gazprom Neft’s work on the Russian Arctic shelf. Leading Russian and international news agencies participated in a press tour of Prirazlomnaya.
In order to provide a better understanding of Gazprom Neft’s projects, the Company gave 
journalists an opportunity to attend further press tours at other facilities, such as Omsk Lubricants Plant and the Company's new bitumen production facility in Shymkent (Kazakhstan).DEVELOPING REPORTING ON SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT
Gazprom Neft’s publication of an annual Sustainable Development Report 
is an essential component of its stakeholder engagement. The disclosure of information concerning the social and environmental aspects of the Company's business in conjunction with financial and economic information, and information about the Company's management, provides an integrated view of the Company’s current and future development. 
In 2007, the Company prepared and published its first Sustainable Development Report. Since 
2008, it has synchronized the drafting of its Sustainable Development Report and the corporate Annual Report through a joint working group. Since 2010, the Company has used the international Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to prepare this Report. During the reporting year, the Company began shifting to the new version of this standard, GRI-G4. Specifically, this version places stricter requirements on the determination of substantive topics and particular emphasis on promoting the principle of social responsibility in the supply chain.
Since 2012, the Company's reports have undergone independent public certification by the Non-
Financial Reporting Board of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs

Gazprom Neft’s sustainability reports have received high praise from stakeholders. The Company’s leadership in sustainability reporting was recognized in 2013 by a diploma awarded by the Moscow Stock Exchange, and in 2014 when Gazprom Neft won the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs’ Leaders of Russian Business: Trends and Responsibility competition in the High Quality Sustainability Reporting category.

a plant in Kazakhstan; Gazprom Neft Shelf, which supports the operation and development of the Prirazlomnaya oil rig; and Gazprom Neft Marine Bunker offices in Romania and Estonia.
The staff turnover rate decreased by 3.3% compared with 2013 due to the completion of sales 
unit restructuring during the reporting year. As part of the restructuring, large-scale organizational changes were implemented, including the incorporation and liquidation of regional companies, geographical relocation of employees, and the reallocation of functions and activities among enterprises. These measures contributed to an increase in staff dismissals, leading to a 3.5% increase in turnover in 2013. In 2014, the restructuring process and related staff reductions were completed, and consequently the turnover rate fell again.Gazprom Neft's HR management strategy is drafted in accordance with the Company's business strategy, taking into account sustainable development goals and objectives and the expectations of stakeholders. 
In 2013, the Company's HR strategy was updated to comply with the new Gazprom Neft 
2025 Development Strategy. The most important aspects of the HR strategy are:
 sys

 enhan ced HR management performance
One of the priority areas of the Company's HR policy is to increase employee productivity. The Company has a performance management system based on a set of indicators for different levels of management and individual targets for each employee. Staff assessment is an important component of the system. Regular assessments have been conducted at Corporate Headquarters as part of the annual review process since 2012, and the Company's subsidiaries and affiliates have carried out evaluations since 2013. Employee performance is assessed on an annual basis according to two criteria: meeting objectives and specialist potential. The assessment results are used for career planning and to identify employees for the talent pool. The results also influence salary reviews and annual bonuses. 
During the reporting year, there was a particular focus on talent pool planning and the 
development of professional skills in order to create a highly professional team capable of achieving the Company’s strategic goals in changing social and economic conditions.
In 2013, the Company began to implement a functional management model. This requires the active 
participation of managers in key corporate and production functions in developing staff throughout Gazprom Neft. The initiative helps support the business in such areas as staff recruitment and rotation, skills development, and dissemination of best practices and technologies within the Company. 57,515

DEVELOPMENT OF WORKFORCE CAPACITYNON-MATERIAL INCENTIVES
The Company is constantly expanding its non-material incentives for employees.
Gazprom Neft has a long-held tradition of publicly recognizing staff achievements. Every year, 
the Company awards two kinds of honorary titles, which are its corporate marks of distinction: Honoured Gazprom Neft Worker and Gazprom Neft Veteran. 
During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft-Aero launched a new system of corporate competitions designed to improve the operational efficiency of enterprises and the professional skills of employees. Gazprom Neft's traditional competition, Best in Profession, has been adapted for the new system. Now, in addition to the internal professional skills competitions and team competitions held at each of the enterprises, subsidiaries and affiliates will be able to compete for the title of Best Enterprise of the Year at Gazprom Neft-Aero. The project aims to increase employee engagement, which has a direct effect on the level of service provided and, consequently, on achieving the Company’s business objectives to expand its cooperation with government and civil airlines.CORPORATE COMPETITIONS
COOPERATION WITH TRADE UNIONS
Trade union organizations, which represent more than two-thirds of the 
Company's employees, are Gazprom Neft's partners in the development and implementation of social programmes that address issues affecting social and labour rights and employees’ interests. Union leaders from major subsidiaries attend meetings of the heads of HR departments that deal with topical HR issues.
Social and labour relations between employees and the Company are specified in collective 
agreements. A standard agreement regulates the balance between the interests of the employer and those of employees in the event of the Company’s reorganization or a reduction in the workforce and staff cuts.
1 A special section of the agreement stipulates the areas in which 
the following should be involved: work safety commissioners, members of occupational safety commissions (committees), and representatives of primary trade union organizations responsible for creating a safe working environment and preventing occupational accidents and diseases. The Company's trade union organizations actively engage with young professionals. Commissions established by trade union committees for working with young employees participate in matters affecting the interests of young workers, as well as in the development and implementation of programmes to help new young employees adapt to working life. 1  The agreement specifies the minimum notice 
pe
riods for informing the relevant employment 
agencies and the elected primary trade union organization representative: at least two months prior to the start of the measures concerned, and, if the decision to reduce the workforce or cut staff may result in widespread layoffs, at least three months prior to the start of the measures concerned. professional skills competitions

DEVELOPMENT OF WORKFORCE CAPACITYPROFESSIONAL SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
Professional skills development is based on an assessment of employees’ professional knowledge 
in accordance with the strategic objectives of the production divisions. The proportion of vocational training increased in 2014 to 72% (in relation to managerial training).
During the reporting year, the Company continued to establish professional and technical skills 
models in various divisions. The Upstream Division assessed its professional skills in order to analyse vocational development trends. The Division evaluated more than 1,000 engineering and technical staff from Corporate Headquarters and 11 of the Division’s subsidiaries. 
The Upstream Division revised its training plan to increase the share of vocational education and 
training, and it also increased the percentage of training conducted by internal instructors in comparison with 2013. In order to achieve this, the Division arranged an open selection programme to recruit expert candidates and train future internal instructors. As a result, 24 new programmes were put together and trainers recruited to teach them. During the reporting year, these trainers conducted 53 of the 122 technical training sessions held within the Upstream Division. 
The Downstream Division continued to pursue professional skills development projects. A pilot 
test was carried out with workers at five divisions included in the Technical Skills Monitoring System as part of a project to develop a skills model for Gazprom Neft-Moscow Refinery divisions in 2014. Specialists working in key positions and members of the talent pool for these positions also underwent testing. As a result of the testing, development areas for the staff assessed were determined. As part of the creation of technical skills development programmes, the Company designed a professional training system for engineers and technical experts with IFP Training (French Institute of Petroleum). 
During 2014, within the corporate functions, professional and vocational skills were modelled in 
five functional areas: HR, IT, corporate communications, industrial safety, and legal services. The methodology behind the professional skills model is based on tying the level of knowledge and skill requirements to the level of responsibility: as an employee's responsibility increases, their knowledge and skills progress from basic to professional and business knowledge accordingly. As a result, a profile is developed for each position within a function, where the development of each profiled competency is assessed on a scale from 1 to 5."There are many professionals in our company who have gained advanced experience not only in the Company, but also in the industry. The development of basic trainer skills will enable such employees to share their experience with colleagues and improve the potential of the Company as a whole. The knowledge, skills, and experience of each employee are our most valuable resource."

MANAGERIAL AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS DEVELOPMENTKNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND DISTANCE LEARNING
The Company has operated a Corporate Management Academy since 2013. The Academy’s mission 
is to develop the managerial and leadership skills of managers. 
In 2014, the Academy developed and launched a new module: the Gazprom Neft Bachelor 
of Management. This programme aims to develop the managerial and leadership skills of high-potential employees. The pilot project has proved successful. The programme will therefore be included in the Academy’s educational process and students will be enrolled on it. At the moment, the module-based Management Academy has five training levels: from line managers to senior managers. Given the Company's rapid growth, distance learning and knowledge sharing technologies are becoming more and more significant. Distance learning makes it possible to optimize expenditure on employee development and to increase the accessibility of knowledge and the scope of staff training programmes. For this reason, Gazprom Neft actively developed this area in 2014, conducting an analysis of needs and best practices in the field of distance learning and knowledge management systems. Based on the results of this analysis, the Company decided to create a Knowledge Portal using WebTutor. The portal will become one of the essential tools in Gazprom Neft's Innovation and Knowledge Management System (IKMS), which will be established in 2015. 
The purpose of creating this system is to improve cooperation and knowledge sharing between 
all Company employees, units, and subsidiaries and affiliates. The system makes it possible to bring together and share Gazprom Neft's considerable intellectual capital using the WebTutor platform, and increase the general level of use of the Company's internal intellectual resources. The focus of the IKMS will be management of the Company’s main knowledge resources, inclusion in key business processes, the creation of expert communities, and social learning (learning from each other).
Professional distance learning has been most heavily developed in the Upstream Division. In 2014, 
the Company designed two e-learning courses and began work on another three for production staff self-study as part of the implementation of new production standards. The use of this form of learning makes it possible to introduce new standards, increase productivity, and optimize production processes in the shortest time possible. More than 600 Upstream Division specialists in all production regions have already completed the first two professional courses: Standard Procedure for the Protection of Downhole Equipment From Corrosion and Standard Procedure for the Preparation of Service Fluids and for Well Plugging. These innovative professional training tools are being created in collaboration with the Company's leading experts in the subject and training specialists. 
During the reporting year, the Company began designing interactive e-learning courses for 
knowledge transfer and the development of Company functions. The Recruitment and Education and Development functions were the first to transfer their core knowledge into an e-learning format. Similar courses for other functions are currently in development. By the end of 2014, the Education and Development Portal had more than 40 interactive e-learning courses available to Gazprom Neft employees. "The Recruitment Guide e-course helps us to speed up the process of creating a uniform recruitment standard at the Company. The course helps specialists at subsidiaries to acquire additional knowledge of the methods and sources used to locate and recruit staff, as well as how to conduct interviews with candidates."

A TALENT POOL 
The Company's work with graduates and young professionals is aimed at 
attracting the best graduates and offering them opportunities for professional growth and development with the Company. The Company's youth programmes are designed to support young professionals at all stages of their relationship with Gazprom Neft, from their first introduction to the Company to when they become members of the team.The Company believes that creating and developing a high-quality talent pool is a task of strategic importance. Gazprom Neft is constantly refining its system for assessing and selecting high-potential employees and improving career planning to ensure that the Company has access to the maximum possible number of qualified staff in future.
How the Company works with graduates and young specialists 
WORKING WITH UNIVERSITY AND SCHOOL STUDENTS AND GRADUATES
In 2014, the Company approved a new concept for cooperating with state educational institutions, 
providing a return on investment and work at the request of companies, reflecting their staff requirements. The new concept entails creating educational programmes in accordance with the Company's objectives and involving Gazprom Neft experts in the educational process. 
During the reporting year, the Company continued its cooperation with universities and specialized 
secondary schools. Gazprom Neft's partner universities of many years standing include the National Mineral Resources University, the Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (state university), Ufa State Petroleum Technological University, Tomsk Polytechnic University, and Omsk State Technical University. School and university students who cooperate with the Company have the opportunity to complete an internship at Gazprom Neft enterprises. Every year, more than 500 students undertake such internships. Based on their performance, students may receive a job offer from the Company. 
One of the most important youth projects during the reporting year was the opening of an 
affiliated Gazprom Neft Faculty at Omsk State Technical University. In 2014, 40 students were enrolled on the course. The learning process will focus on practical sessions, which will take place at one of the most cutting-edge oil refineries in Russia: Gazprom Neft’s Omsk Refinery."The creation of an affiliated Gazprom Neft Faculty will give OSTU students far more opportunities to participate in major innovative projects. The faculty is the result of years of collaboration between the university and Gazprom Neft: previously, the oil company supported the establishment of the Petrochemical Institute and the opening of modern laboratories and areas of study."

In 2014, in order to identify these employees at all levels of the organization, the Company began 
to integrate its talent pool with performance and potential assessment and its goal management system. 
The Company also continued to establish talent committees during 2014. These are collegial 
bodies that assess employee potential and support development and promotion. The committees consider specialists who are referred to them on the basis of their annual assessment. During the last 33 talent committee meetings, 750 key positions were identified and 1,091 members of the talent pool were approved. Individual development plans are being drafted and implemented for these specialists. Special emphasis is given to the robustness (number of candidates) and relevancy (proportion of appointments) of the talent pool. In 2015, a new talent pool methodology will be rolled out across a number of subsidiaries.

In 2014, the Company's subsidiaries recruited more than 160 university graduates. There are more than 500 young employees at Gazprom Neft.
The Company operates the Three Milestones Programme – a three-year development programme 
for young specialists at production enterprises. It is designed to unlock professional and career potential, and includes activities to help employees adapt, enrichment training, and a mentoring system. The best graduates from the programme are recommended for inclusion in the talent pool. In 2014, the Company launched a new programme to develop the coaching skills of those mentoring young professionals. 
The largest event in the Three Milestones Programme is the Corporate Gathering, which brings 
together the best young specialists from across the Company. Participants have the opportunity to prove themselves at the corporate level, network with new professional contacts and make friends, and deepen their knowledge of vertically integrated oil companies and Gazprom Neft specifically. In 2014, 102 young Company employees attended the event. Gazprom Neft's annual Young Professionals R&D and Technical Conference is yet another significant event devoted to the development of young specialists at subsidiaries and affiliates. The Conference’s objectives are to develop the scientific potential and economic thinking of young people, spread innovation beyond individual businesses, develop presentation skills, and help employees learn how to defend their ideas. The 2014 Conference was the fourth of its kind. Participants defended their research projects before a jury consisting of managers from Corporate Headquarters and subsidiaries and representatives of the National Mineral Resources University.
Gazprom Neft took third place in the Russian Employers 2014 ranking complied by recruitment 
company HeadHunter, moving up two positions from 2013 and achieving its best result since its first appearance in the ranking (in 2011). In addition, the Company's project “Let's Do the Gemba Walk!”
1 was awarded third place in the Federation category at the HR Brand awards, and it also 
won a special The Client is Everything award for HR projects showing significant improvement in their customer focus.
“Let's Do the Gemba Walk!” involves managers and office staff in Gazprom Neft’s retail divisions 
replacing frontline staff across the Company's own network of service stations for one day, refuelling vehicles and working as filing-station operatives, cashiers, and managers. At the end of their secondments, participants make proposals on ways to improve the business, the best of which are then implemented. The project has not only helped improve the quality of service at filling stations; it has also significantly increased business efficiency, standardized business processes, and improved the training system for new staff. Today, “Gemba” is part of a mandatory training programme, in which employees from the Company’s different business divisions participate. More than 2,000 people have already taken part in the project and made 1,365 practical proposals, 20% of which have been implemented.“Through the Three Milestones Programme, a pool of expertise and human resources has been created to guarantee the Company's long-term staffing needs. My status as a young professional helped me, a university graduate who came to work for the Company, to successfully adapt to working here, improve my personal skills, and develop the required professional competencies. After three years at the Company I became a successful, highly qualified employee. Participation in scientific conferences and meetings allows young professionals to attract the attention of management and secure a promising future at the Company."

Gazprom Neft believes that increasing occupational safety and reducing the risks

The Company aims to become one of the leading oil companies in the world in terms of industrial and environmental safety and occupational safety, and is consistently improving its work in these fields. Gazprom Neft operates in accordance with the requirements of Russian law and international standards for health, safety, and the environment, occupational safety, and civil defence (HSE, OS, and CD).

in the field of HSE, OS, and CDHSE, OS, AND CD PRIORITIES:
The Company has had a corporate HSE, OS, and CD policy since 2008. The policy was revised in 2014, with the addition of a declaration that the Company's leadership team is responsible for the successful management of occupational risks that could affect the life and health of employees, property, and the environment.
Corporate HSE, OS, and CD standards are regularly updated in line with new legislation 
and structural changes at the Company. The ‘System for Managing Health, Safety, and the Environment, Occupational Safety, and Civil Defence. General Provisions and Structure’, and the ‘Accidents. Operational Notifications, Investigations, Registrations, and Periodic Reporting’ standards were updated in 2014. 
Gazprom Neft's HSE, OS, and CD policy is fundamental to the operation and improvement of 
the HSE, OS, and CD management system, which complies with the requirements of OHSAS 18001:2007 and ISO 14001:2004 international standards and covers all Gazprom Neft production facilities. 
The commencement of major projects to the north of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, 
the development of the Arctic shelf, access to new markets in Russia and abroad, and the modernization and development of the Company's own infrastructure present new risk management requirements in the area of HSE, OS, and CD. Due to the need to further enhance safety levels in 2014, Gazprom Neft began to reorganize its HSE, OS, and CD management system. The updated management structure complies with advanced approaches to management in this area, and has been implemented in the Upstream Division. It is still being established in the Downstream Division. The project will increase the level of industrial safety and allow for more effective monitoring of compliance with legal and corporate standards at subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as for the assessment of occupational risks associated with the Company's major projects. 
A uniform integral indicator has been developed at Gazprom Neft to assess operations in terms 
of key HSE, OS, and CD indicators: accident and injury rates; implementation of programmes at subsidiaries to prevent injuries, fire, transport, and environmental accidents, and implementation of civil defence measures. The results of this assessment are taken into account in the annual review of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company conducts annual audits of the management systems at its subsidiaries and affiliates, and regularly carries out industrial environmental control and monitoring of environmental components."Every business has very clear performance indicators. However, behind all the financial and operating performance indicators there are people, and ensuring their safety is more important than any production concern. In developing an industrial safety system, we are guided by the same principles that we follow in our business processes, making efficiency our cornerstone priority. Gazprom Neft is a recognized efficiency leader in the Russian industry. Becoming a leader on safety issues is no less important a task and a priority for our development."

SUPPLY CHAIN RESPONSIBILITY
Corporate requirements in terms of HSE, OS, and CD standards are considered when selecting 
contractors. One of the important pre-qualification criteria for contractors is that they comply with Gazprom Neft HSE, OS, and CD requirements. This minimizes the risk of working with unscrupulous contractors. The Company pays particular attention to a contractor's industrial and environmental safety policy, whether it has an HSE, OS, and CD management system that focuses on risk management for the service they supply, and whether it has training programmes that take the specific industry into account. All contractors sign an HSE, OS, and CD agreement that stipulates mandatory compliance with the Company’s industrial and environmental safety standards. 
In 2014, the Upstream Division developed the Steps strategy to improve the efficiency of its work 
with contractors in the area of HSE, OS, and CD. The strategy aims to engage all professionals from associated directorates, subsidiaries, and contractor companies in resolving production safety issues. It covers all steps of the process from initiating contracts to the completion of service provision. As part of implementing the strategy across all Upstream Division subsidiaries and major projects, diagnostic audits of contractor cooperation procedures will be conducted, and specialized training will be organized for contract advisers, supervisors, and technical supervision specialists. By the end of 2015, the Upstream Division plans to have updated its procedural guidelines in this area. The project will ensure that the cooperation process with contractors is organized in accordance with the corporate HSE, OS, and CD policy and standards. The Company expects that the implementation of the Steps strategy will have a dramatic effect on accident statistics and reduce the number of incidents, most of which are currently attributed to contractor fault.Determining HSE, OS, and CD

MODERNIZATION PROGRAMME 
ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS
Since 2009, Gazprom Neft-Moscow Refinery has been implementing a programme 
to upgrade its production facilities in order to improve the quality of petroleum 
products, increase refining depth, and improve industrial and environmental 
efficiency. Investments in environmental safety amounted to more than 
RUB 14 billion. During this period, the Company constructed a large bitumen plant, 
closed mechanical treatment facilities, and reconstructed a sulphur production plant, 
leading to a reduction in atmospheric emissions. The Company has eliminated legacy 
oil-contaminated waste, dismantled old exposed treatment plants, and carried out 
land rehabilitation measures.
Investments in the modernization and reconstruction of the 
Moscow Refinery will total more than RUB 130 billion by 2020, of which RUB 21 billion will be directed at environmental protection measures. Major environmental projects include the renovation and construction of oil refining facilities, the processing of sulphur and alkaline wastewater and process condensate, biological treatment plants, and measures to reduce adverse impacts on the sanitary protection zone (equipping reservoirs with pontoons, installing a nitrogen ‘breathing’ system, constructing local sewage treatment plants, etc.).
PROTECTING THE ATMOSPHERE
The Moscow Refinery is implementing a programme to reduce atmospheric emissions. Measures undertaken in 2014 have helped to reduce total pollutant emissions by 12%. Thanks to the modernization programme, annual sulphur emissions have decreased by 20% since 2010. By 2020, the Moscow Refinery will have upgraded its process furnaces and switched completely to environmentally-friendly gaseous fuel. This will reduce sulphur oxide emissions by more than 95%.The plant has a monitoring system that makes it possible to fully control air quality on the industrial site and in the enterprise’s sanitary protection zone. Air quality studies conducted at eleven points within the sanitary protection zone and the plant area by the plant's own environmental laboratory. The air quality in the plant's working area and at the sources of pollutant emissions is also assessed by an independent accredited laboratory. A fixed automated control system consisting of two control points monitoring gas contamination also controls air quality in the sanitary protection zone.
The Company places special emphasis on keeping stakeholders 
informed of its environmental protection activities. In December 2014, the Moscow Refinery’s official website launched the Ecoinformer project, publishing daily updates on air quality and environmental conditions at the plant and within the sanitary protection zone. Ecoinformer provides statistical data on six key indicators (carbon monoxide, C1-C10 hydrocarbons, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, and benzene), and compares the current level of pollutants in the air with the maximum allowable concentrations. 
WASTE MANAGEMENT
Biological treatment is used to process waste at the Moscow Refinery. The system is based on the use of biological preparations consisting of natural microorganisms that actively process hydrocarbons. Oil sludge is sent to a specially equipped site where it is detoxified. Waste is mixed with structuring agents (sawdust or peat) and then treated with biological preparations. Depending on the weather conditions, it can take up to two months to detoxify the sludge. Biological treatment turns sludge into a new product: class IV hazard ground soil. The new product can then be used for filling.PROTECTING WATER RESOURCES
In 2014, the Moscow Refinery completed the first stage of a project to construct biological treatment facilities to purify water with 98–99% efficiency. 
The new treatment facilities will include two-stage pressure 
flotation, a membrane bioreactor, carbon filtration unit, reverse osmosis unit, and a waste processing unit. The bioreactor will be completely enclosed and equipped with a powerful air cleaning system that eliminates odours.
The water purification project proposes the use of reverse 
osmosis, filtering biologically treated water through a membrane with pore sizes of 0.01–0.2 microns. This process ensures that virtually all suspended solids and microorganisms are captured. The technology will make it possible to reuse up to 75% of water, reducing the amount of waste water that the plant discharges into the centralized sewage system by a factor of three. The waste water treatment facilities will have a processing capacity of 1,400 m
3/h. Construction is expected 
to begin in the third quarter of 2015.> RUB  14 billion

Reducing pollutant emissions is one of Gazprom Neft’s major operating tasks. 
The Company develops and implements programmes to conserve the natural ambient atmosphere at facilities with high infrastructural load and is also developing measures to gradually reduce adverse impacts on air quality in areas with underdeveloped infrastructure. 
The air quality protection programme includes measures to inventory emission sources, develop 
project documentation, organize monitoring studies of air quality components at supervised facilities (stations), and upgrade equipment in order to reduce pollutant emissions.
The Company is consistently reducing the emission of pollutants into the air thanks to a programme 
to recover associated petroleum gas (APG) at production facilities and a programme to upgrade and reconstruct processing facilities at refineries. In 2014, total emissions were reduced by 14.55% compared with 2013, and by 51.88% compared with 2012. 
In 2014, Gazprom Neft developed guidelines for the calculation of annual greenhouse gas emissions 
that take into account the specific features of the Company's activities. Greenhouse gas emissions during 2013–2014 were calculated for the Company's subsidiaries in accordance with the new methodology. A summary of this information can be found in the Annual Report.
The Company continued to implement programmes to increase APG utilization in 2014. APG 
utilization has been increased as a result of the flaring system upgrade and APG redirection. Consequently, total emissions of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere at production sites have been cut by 16.6% compared with 2013 (the volume of APG flaring increased by 4.8% in 2014 compared with 2013, due to an increase in oil production).
Major projects currently being implemented to improve APG utilization include the construction 
of a gas processing plant at the Yuzhno-Priobskaya compressor station, the construction of new compressor stations at the Yety-Purovskoye field and in Tomsk Region, and the development of transport capacity for delivering growing volumes of gas to Orenburg Gas Processing Plant. Through these and other investment projects, the Company plans to achieve a 90% APG utilization level after 2016.

The Company operates in accordance with sustainable water use and 
conservation principles and the requirements of Russian environmental legislation. Gazprom Neft implements a set of measures aimed at reducing environmental risks in this area and improving the environmental condition of water bodies and coastal areas. 
The Company upgrades water treatment plants, maintains and repairs wells, and performs 
laboratory and instrumental monitoring of water protection zones, surface waters, groundwater, and wastewater. It also evaluates the condition of surface water bed silt deposits. Production facilities conduct non-destructive testing and pipeline monitoring at water crossings and arrange for underwater surveys of the areas in order to enhance the reliability of water crossings. 
The increase in the volume of water in water reuse systems is the result of increased oil production. 
The increase in the volume of water in water recycling systems is the result of an increase in oil refining volume. In this regard, the Company continues to work on increasing the volume of used water in water recycling and reuse systems. At the Omsk and Moscow refineries, projects to create enclosed treatment facilities have been launched. The new facilities make it possible to remove up to 99% of pollutants from the water. Up to 70% of the water can be returned to the production cycle, reducing the burden on municipal treatment facilities. The design of the treatment facilities at Omsk Refinery involves the creation of an aeration tank (a tank in which bacteria consume the residual hydrocarbons) and sedimentation tank. The Moscow Refinery will use a purification technology based on a membrane bioreactor.
The Company mainly disposes of wastewater at filling stations. The network of filling stations is 
designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements and standards of environmental protection regulations. Filling stations have storm, industrial, and commercial water treatment facilities. The volume of wastewater increased in 2014 due to an increase in the number of filling stations.

SAFE DEVELOPMENT: INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY, OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ENERGY CONSERVATIONWASTE MANAGEMENT LAND USE AND SOIL REHABILITATION
The Company implements its industrial and consumer waste management 
initiatives in accordance with Russian laws and regulations, regulatory and procedural guidelines, and international standards. The industrial waste management system optimizes waste streams, reduces environmental impact, and cuts costs.The Company takes annual measures to conserve and restore land resources, taking account of climatic, hydrological, soil, and vegetation conditions  
in the regions in which it operates. 
The Company keeps initial records of waste and determines the associated properties and 
environmental hazard class. It certifies hazardous waste, and arranges ongoing monitoring of waste generation and management. 
Gazprom Neft performs an inventory of waste storage and disposal facilities in order to 
determine their compliance with the requirements of regulatory documents and guidelines. When management decisions to create new waste disposal facilities are made, the environmental implications of such decisions are always taken into account. Where required by the laws of the Russian Federation, the Company performs an environmental impact assessment (EIA).

EFFICIENCY 
An active energy-saving policy is a strategic priority for Gazprom Neft. The 
Company works hard to enhance energy efficiency and optimize the use of energy resources, implementing a systematic approach to different areas of energy conservation at its enterprises. 
The Company has its own Gazprom Neft Energy Policy. The main objectives of this policy include 
enhancing the energy efficiency of the Company's enterprises while maintaining or improving reliability, safety, and performance; reducing adverse impacts on the environment, and cutting consumption of non-renewable energy resources. 
Since 2012, Gazprom Neft has been gradually phasing in an energy management system that 
complies with the requirements of ISO 50001:2011. In 2014, the system was fully deployed at Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery and Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegas. Both companies have undergone a certification audit to ensure that their energy management systems comply with the requirements of ISO 50001:2011. 
The Company places particular emphasis on improving the reliability of its electricity supply. During 
the reporting year, the programme to improve reliability and upgrade the Upstream Division’s electrical equipment and networks made it possible to reduce oil loss during power failures by 14%. Thanks to measures to improve reliability and upgrade electrical equipment and networks at oil refining enterprises in the Downstream Division, the number of downtime hours at processing facilities due to power supply failures fell by 17%.Specific energy consumption for the

In implementing its energy management system, the Company 
focuses particularly on training. During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft specialists and managers attended the Energy Efficiency of Production Equipment and Ground Infrastructure of Oil Production Enterprises training course. The course was developed especially for Gazprom Neft by specialists at Ufa State Petroleum Technological University, taking into account the accumulated experience at the Company. Also in 2014, the St. Petersburg Energy Institute of Advanced Training ran a training course for Gazprom Neft energy service managers. A special feature of the course was that it offered energy specialists at subsidiaries and functional managers at Corporate Headquarters the opportunity to directly participate in decisions concerning the study programme. The course was taught by managers from divisions responsible for energy policy at the Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision (Rostekhnadzor) and Rosseti. 
ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMUPSTREAM DIVISION
Electricity accounts for a significant part of the operating costs of oil-producing companies. Energy efficiency and cost optimization are therefore a priority for Upstream Division enterprises. Energy-saving measures at Upstream Division enterprises aim to reduce the energy-related component of the overall costs per unit of production. 
In 2014, more than 70 such measures were implemented. The most significant were: 
 the u
se of energy-efficient electric centrifugal pumps 
 the i
ntroduction of valve electric motors 
 the
 optimization of downhole equipment configuration and operation 
 the
 optimization of pump operation at cluster pumping stations, booster pump stations, 
and preliminary water discharge units 
 the
 decommissioning of unprofitable wells
 the r
eduction of electricity losses in networks
Upstream Division energy saving measures in 2014 resulted in overall savings of  
153 million kWh, or RUB 518 million. The main energy efficiency indicator at Upstream Division facilities is the specific electricity 
consumption for liquid extraction: in 2014, this figure decreased by 0.2% at Upstream Division enterprises compared with 2013. The Implementation of an Energy 
Management System at Gazprom Neft project was awarded first place by the Russian Ministry of Energy in the category for Best Management System for Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency at Oil and Gas Companies.ENERGY

In 2014, Gazprom Neft, together with regional authorities, launched a full-scale programme to substitute imported lubricants and technical fluids used in various industries and utilities. The programme is underway in Omsk, Orenburg, and Murmansk regions and in a number of other areas of the Russian Federation. Under the programme, the Company supplies lubricants and technical fluids to state and municipal enterprises that previously used imported products. In addition, Gazprom Neft provides a number of services. The Company's high-tech production facilities enable it to supply consumers with products which are in no way inferior to similar foreign products, while at the same time significantly reducing government expenditure.IMPORT SUBSTITUTION PROGRAMME

REGIONAL POLICIES AND DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIESTOOLS OF SOCIAL POLICY IN THE REGIONS
Gazprom Neft’s social policy is implemented primarily through social and 
economic agreements with regional and municipal authorities, targeted social investment projects, corporate volunteering, targeted corporate charity, as well as a social initiatives grant competition – one of the most effective tools for getting local communities involved in the Company's social activities and regional social and economic transformation.
In 2014, the Company signed social and economic agreements with the authorities of Yamalo-
Nenets Autonomous District and Omsk, Orenburg, and Tyumen regions. During the reporting year, the Company had agreements with the governments of nine Russian regions and 16 municipal administrations.
All of the Company's social and charitable projects are implemented under the consolidated Home 
Towns social investment programme, introduced in 2013. The programme promotes quality of life in cities where the Company operates by increasing access to modern urban infrastructure, education, and culture. Home Towns promotes internal sources of development by engaging non-profit organizations and volunteers, as well as by forming partnerships with local authorities. In 2014, the Company implemented more than 350 projects in 23 Russian regions under the Home Towns programme. Twenty-five of the Company's subsidiaries implemented joint projects with local communities.

the results of dialogue with stakeholders (including local residents and regional authorities), as well as Gazprom Neft's monitoring of the social wellbeing of the region, using both the Company's own data and independent research. In its social initiatives, Gazprom Neft aims to involve local residents and non-profit organizations (NPOs) in the discussion of topical regional issues, thereby contributing to the formation of socially active communities as a fundamental factor in sustainable regional development. In 2013, Gazprom Neft introduced a new tool to support projects by regional residents: the social initiatives grant competition. This allows the Company to respond to a range of challenges, including:

issues 
 cre
ating the conditions for selecting the most promising projects fairly 
 devel

NPOs, government authorities, and experts from the philanthropic community are involved in discussing the topical priorities for the competition, developing criteria for quality projects, and reviewing incoming applications. It is also significant that the competition procedure is a learning process that includes orientation workshops on social project planning for those seeking funding, consultations on the competition results for all participants, and project management consultations for winning organizations. In 2014, the Company set up a telephone hotline in order to provide additional support for grant applicants.
During the reporting year, grant competitions were held in the Company's major oil-producing 
regions: Yamalo-Nenets and Khanty-Mansiysk autonomous districts; Orenburg, Tomsk, and Omsk regions, and the city of Omsk. Candidates submitted a total of 297 applications, of which 71 were awarded grants from RUB 50,000 to RUB 300,000. The total value of the grants was RUB 16.5 million.

The Company develops a dialogue with all stakeholders when implementing 
social policy in the regions. ROUND TABLE IN ORENBURG
On 31 October 2014, a round table on Gazprom Neft's Activities and the Sustainable Development 
of its Operating Regions was held in Orenburg. The event was attended by employees from the Company's Corporate Headquarters, the Gazprom Neft Orenburg subsidiary, representatives of Orenburg Region’s executive and legislative authorities, experts in the field of corporate social responsibility and charity, and representatives from public and non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and the media. 
A key topic of the meeting concerned Gazprom Neft Orenburg’s strategies and future plans, as well 
as the impact of its activities on regional development in terms of the economy, the environment, and social processes. Participants were briefed on the progress of the Home Towns programme. 
During the discussion, participants proposed that the Company:
 inform potential local contractors of its procurement plans for the next two or three years, and 
disclose its requirements for contractors
 exchange information with the Government of Orenburg Region about planned decisions and the 
import substitution programme, and facilitate the coordination of these plans 
 provide not only financial, but also organizational and methodological support for social projects 
in local communities
 start engaging business partners in the discussion and joint implementation of social projects
 extend opportunities for cooperation under the Home Towns programme 
 organize opportunities for grant recipients to share experience and apply successfully 
implemented projects to other regions, including via master classes, seminars, field trips, etc.
Gazprom Neft representatives considered all the proposals received. Issues related to organizing 
meetings with local suppliers and establishing channels for exchanging information about import substitution with the Government of Orenburg Region have been taken into account in the Company’s plans.Dialogue formats include:
 working meetings and consultations
 participation of Company representatives in working groups in key operating regions
 public hearings and residents’ meetings when planning social investment programmes
 consultations with NPO representatives when determining areas for social investment
 online polls and open competitions among the population when implementing social investment 
projects
 collection of feedback through the social investment programme website: www.rodnyegoroda.ru.
The Company regularly discusses issues related to the management of social projects at extended meetings of the Corporate Communications Division. These meetings are attended by Corporate Headquarters staff and representatives from subsidiaries and affiliates responsible for project implementation. Leading social project planning experts and NPO sector heads are invited to the meetings. Through these meetings, a database of best practice in managing social projects is created, enabling the project to be subsequently rolled out across other regions of operations.
In 2014, Gazprom Neft made considerable use of round tables to promote dialogue with 
stakeholders. The purpose of such round tables was to inform the various stakeholder groups about the Company's development, plans, and social policy objectives. Round tables are an effective way for Gazprom Neft to obtain feedback from stakeholders, whose comments and suggestions are taken into account by the Company when planning production, environmental, and social activities in the regions.
The first round tables of 2014 were held in the cities of Orenburg and Muravlenko (Yamalo-
Nenets Autonomous District). These events focused on issues concerning the Company's social investments, and they provided an expert evaluation of the effectiveness of the Home Towns social investment programme in these regions.
For more information, visit 
www.rodnyegoroda.ruIn 2014, the Company launched a Home Towns web portal 
(http://www.rodnyegoroda.ru), containing information about the programme, its main objectives, and projects which have been implemented. The portal won a 2014 Runet Award in the State and Society category, and it received a special prize at the 14th Golden Site All-Russian Internet Contest in the Topical and Socially Significant Project at the Federal Level category."The organization of round tables in 
the regions is a significant step for the Company, since they allow two issues important to the Company, as one of Russia’s leading businesses, to be addressed even more successfully. The first issue is increasing the openness and transparency of business. The second is developing a constructive dialogue in order to achieve better understanding and increased confidence, which form the only effective basis for cooperating with partners."

“Gazprom Neft Orenburg plays a 
significant role in the economic development of the region, which is particularly important in the current socio-economic situation. Currently, the company can be considered as an example of how to implement targeted industrial and social policy. The company works systematically to tackle environmental issues, and it clearly fulfils all the obligations of its social and economic agreements by implementing a comprehensive, targeted social programme. The company has been our reliable social partner for several years now."

A round table on Gazprom Neft's Activities and the Sustainable Development of the City of 
Muravlenko was held on 24 October 2014 in Muravlenko (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District). 
The event was attended by staff from Gazprom Neft Corporate Headquarters and Gazpromneft-
Muravlenko, members of the Muravlenko local government, winners of the Company's 2014 grant competition, experts in the field of CSR and charitable activities, representatives of public and non-profit organizations, and the media. 
During the round table, the Company presented its economic and industrial results and areas of 
focus, its Development Strategy, and plans for the development of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. Company representatives particularly emphasized the progress of the Home Towns social investment programme, the holding and results of its grant competitions, and Gazpromneft-Muravlenko’s human resources strategy, which takes into account the fact that the city’s economy is dominated by a single employer. Opinions were exchanged on the most promising forms of cooperation to resolve regional development issues and create a comfortable social environment in Russia’s Far North. 
During the discussion, participants proposed that the Company:
 help municipal and government officials to develop a business culture and partnership skills
 extend the scope of the grant competition
 consider establishing a course for future oil workers in the city, with places assigned on a 
competitive basis
 provide opportunities for college students to present their best work at the Company’s scientific 
conferences, and give Company representatives the opportunity to participate in college events.
"The grant competition is a very 
important step in the implementation of the Gazprom Neft’s social policy. It has changed the pattern of cooperation between business and the heads of public organizations. And, of course, this approach helps to increase the effectiveness of projects led by non-profit organizations. A manager who submits an application learns to think strategically, in the context of the overall development objectives of the region."

RECEIVED AND HAVE TAKEN THE FOLLOWING INTO ACCOUNT IN THE COMPANY’S PLANS: During the round table, the Company 
presented its economic and industrial results and areas of focus, its Development Strategy, and plans for the development of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. Company representatives particularly emphasized the progress of the Home Towns social investment programme and the holding and results of its grant competitions.
During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft launched its Urban Space art project, to encourage art and design in urban infrastructure. Artistically designed infrastructure enhances the colour palette of northern cities. Brightly coloured facades create a positive, creative atmosphere, introducing modern art to local populations. The project pilot began in Noyabrsk. RESULTS OF THE HOME TOWNS 
SOCIAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMME:
An important part of Gazprom Neft's social activity in the regions where it operates involves 
creating a quality urban environment with all the amenities of large towns and major cities. Projects in this area include housing construction and renovation, urban land improvement, and the construction of children’s playgrounds.
The Company places special emphasis on resolving the issue of housing shortages and rundown 
conditions in the regions where it operates. In 2014, with the financial support of Gazprom Neft, a 27-apartment residential block was constructed for public sector employees in the village of Parabel in Tomsk Region. The Company acquired four apartments for newly arrived public sector professionals in the Uvatsky District of Tyumen Region.
The Company’s support for housing construction also includes financing new homes for indigenous 
peoples. In 2014, two new 34-apartment residential buildings were constructed in the village of Novy Port (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District).
The Company contributes to the construction of quality outdoor infrastructure. In 2014, Gazprom 
Neft helped to equip playgrounds in the villages of Blagoslovenka and Platovka in Orenburg Region, and two playgrounds in Omsk. 
One of the most acute problems in the regions is the lack of access to quality healthcare. For this 
reason, health centres are among the facilities that receive social investment from Gazprom Neft. During the reporting year, the Company renovated the local hospital in the village of Karavanny in Orenburg Region, and helped two hospitals in Omsk (In-Patient Clinic No. 7 and Children's Clinical Hospital No. 3) to upgrade their facilities. 
Another pressing issue in regional urban areas is the lack of accessible infrastructure for people 
with disabilities. To help resolve this matter the Company, in partnership with the Omsk Regional Organization of the All-Russian Society for the Disabled, has installed access ramps at public buildings in Omsk’s Sovetsky Administrative District.
During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft launched its Urban Space art project, to encourage art 
and design in urban infrastructure. Artistically designed infrastructure enhances the colour palette of northern cities. Brightly coloured facades create a positive, creative atmosphere, introducing modern art to local populations. The project pilot began in Noyabrsk. A TOWN FOR PEOPLE

This is one of the priorities of the Home Towns programme: a large-scale initiative to create 
a modern, grassroots sports infrastructure, promoting healthy lifestyles, and providing assistance to sports schools and clubs for children and young people. 
For many years, the Gazprom Neft Cup KHL international children’s ice hockey tournament has been 
the Company's major social project to support children's sports. The tournament grew in 2014, expanding to new locations. The number of teams increased from 16 to 24, and for the first time the competition was broken down into two divisions, in Minsk and Omsk. The opening ceremony in Omsk attracted a record number of fans: more than 8,700 people attended. 
In addition to major, professional-level sporting events, Gazprom Neft actively supports the 
development of grassroots children’s sports. In 2014, ice hockey and football tournaments were held in Orenburg Region and the cities of Noyabrsk and Muravlenko (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District). These events included the first hockey tournament played in felt boots for secondary school students in Muravlenko. A similar tournament was also held in Orenburg Region.
In 2014, the Company continued to support the Avangard Hockey Academy project, aimed 
at creating a uniform ice hockey training system for children and young people in the Urals and Siberia, with a branch network extending to different regions. During the reporting year, the Company continued to construct buildings for branches of the Academy in Noyabrsk and Muravlenko.
The Company has supported the development of motor sports in Noyabrsk for many years. The 
Company sponsors the city's motocross club for more than 150 children and teenagers, has established the Gazprom Neft motocross team, and supports contests and races. The Gazprom Neft team became the undisputed motocross champion in Yugra in 2014.
In cooperation with the Yugra Chess Federation and the Yugra Chess Academy, Gazprom Neft runs 
the World of Chess project, opening chess clubs all over Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District where city tournaments, master classes, and simultaneous exhibition matches can be hosted. In 2014, chess clubs were opened at a number of public and educational institutions in the city of Khanty-Mansiysk, the villages of Shapsha and Yarka in the Khanty-Mansiysk District, and on the premises of Gazprom Neft-Khantos. In addition, the Company acts as an organizer and partner for citywide chess tournaments and supports International Chess Day in Khanty-Mansiysk. 
Gazprom Neft supports youth all-round marine sports events in Rostov-on-Don. In 2014, the 
Company became a member of the board of trustees of the Youth Sailing Club military and patriotic public organization and provided it with materials and equipment. NEW HORIZONS
One of the key objectives of the Home Towns programme is to provide equal opportunities for quality education. Gazprom Neft's activities are aimed at supporting education in the regions, addressing the problem of the lack of capacity in nursery facilities, improving the quality of equipment available at educational institutions, and developing institutions of higher education. 
During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft implemented a number of projects to renovate regional 
educational institutions: the Children's Creativity Centre in Tara, Omsk Region, was renovated; support was provided to two nursery schools in Omsk, and five educational institutions in the villages of Berdyanka, Chkalov, and Kuvay in Orenburg Region received assistance. 
Gazprom Neft is a partner to the country's leading universities, where future oil and gas industry 
specialists are educated. In particular, the Company provides assistance to the National Mineral Resources University (St. Petersburg). Gazprom Neft supports educational programmes, facilitates scientific research and production experience, and equips university classrooms with modern instruments and computers. 
In 2014, Gazprom Neft and the Omsk Regional Government signed a higher education partnership 
agreement. The goal of this partnership is to train young professionals. Under the agreement, an affiliated Gazprom Neft faculty has been established at Omsk State Technical University, where students can pursue training in one of two petrochemical disciplines: Machines and Equipment for Chemical Production and Chemical Technology of Natural Energy Sources and Carboniferous Materials. The learning process will focus on practical sessions, which will take place at one of the most cutting-edge oil refineries in Russia: Gazprom Neft’s Omsk Refinery. After completing their higher education, graduates of the affiliated faculty will be given the opportunity to work for Gazprom Neft at its oil refining facilities in Omsk, Moscow, Yaroslavl, or Serbia.
The Company supports programmes and initiatives that contribute to the creation of 'educational 
elevators' for talented secondary school and college students with the potential to become young professionals. Gazprom Neft programmes such as these include initiatives that encompass all levels of education. In 2014, Gazpromneft Research Centre organized its first academic competition in the exact and natural sciences. The event is designed to develop students' interest in the oil and gas field. There were two stages to the competition. During the first stage, participants solved theoretical and practical problems, and during the second, the winners of the regional rounds presented their research projects in St. Petersburg. More than 150 Year 8 and Year 10 students from St. Petersburg and Tyumen participated in the competition. The Company plans to further develop this initiative to increase the number of participating cities and to strengthen the educational role of the competition.
To this end, Gazpromneft Research Centre is implementing the Successful Graduate project, aimed 
at helping young people leaving Children’s Home No. 67 to adapt successfully to society.

Regional Government signed an education partnership agreement. The aim of this cooperation is to train young specialists, including for work at Gazprom Neft enterprises. Over the next six years, the Company will invest around RUB 270 million in Omsk Region educational programmes. "Living in a region where there is much 
development of natural resources, we obviously steer children towards training in the oil sector. Gazprom Neft's initiative to hold an academic competition in the natural and exact sciences provides valuable career guidance for secondary school students by encouraging their interest in the exact sciences."

with St. Petersburg State University’s Chebyshev Laboratory, mathematics students and young scientists were awarded Gazprom Neft scholarships and prizes. The Company also supports the laboratory's research and educational projects. With the financial support of Gazprom Neft, the university held a Gabriel Lamé competition for guest mathematics professors. The event, hosted by St. Petersburg State University, featured lectures by prominent scientists from around the world.
The Company is implementing a project to improve the education of students and industry experts. 
In 2014, the Admiral Makarov State University of Maritime and Inland Shipping received support from Gazprom Neft to acquire simulators for graduate training and the professional development of oil tanker crew members. The Company also provided assistance to the Admiral Ushakov Maritime State University (Novorossiysk), equipping it with new computer classrooms and language laboratories for studying English.
Since 2011, Gazprom Neft has both independently and in cooperation with the Maritime Council of 
the Government of St. Petersburg implemented projects aimed at inspiring young people to take up maritime careers. Every year, the Company helps educational institutions to create specialized marine and shipbuilding classes. It also runs marine and shipbuilding associations for children and young people. In 2014, with the Company's support, the Baltic Sea School was able to obtain specialized equipment, the St. Petersburg Sailing School acquired new vessels, and the Marinesko Museum of Russian Submarine Forces installed a new multimedia display system to help expand its tour programme. In 2015, four maritime career preparatory courses are planned for schools in Rostov-on-Don, supported by the Company. The aim of these courses is to provide military and patriotic education for young people and specialized training to prepare students to serve in the Russian Navy."Gazprom Neft has been providing non-budgetary funding to the Chebyshev Laboratory since 2013. Our work is focused on supporting young scientists and engaging undergraduate and graduate students in applied scientific work, organizing modern courses for them, working with young scientists and recruiting them to participate in internships and conferences, and inviting a large number of scientists from other cities in Russia and abroad in order to support a fully-fledged scientific environment that is conducive to the exchange of ideas. Of course, state funding is key, but it is just as important to have flexible tools that can be used today to accomplish what is necessary. The support we receive from Gazprom Neft allows us to accomplish a great deal and support a large number of young scientists. This is very important, as young people are our future. It is good to know that Russia’s leading company is concerned about the future of our country."

As part of the Home Towns programme, Gazprom Neft supports cultural events and initiatives that 
are important to residents of the regions in which the Company operates. 
During the reporting year, the Company, together with the research centre of the Calvert 22 
Foundation and the Smolny Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences at St. Petersburg State University, conducted a series of events to promote the development of creative industries in Russia. Projects that have received the Company's support include St. Petersburg Design Week: a series of lectures and master classes by leading Russian and international experts and practitioners in contemporary urban design, creative start-ups, and the creative industries, and a public panel discussion at the creative industries session of the 13th Strategic Planning in the Regions and Cities of Russia national forum. During the year, a collection of analytical articles on the creative industries and the collection The Manifesta Journal Reader: Selected Articles on Curation, the official publication of Manifesta 10, the biennial of contemporary art held in St. Petersburg in 2014, were published. 
A new format for Gazprom Neft’s social projects is the Home Towns festival, offering recreational 
activities for families in the regions where the Company operates. The first event, attended by about 400 people, was held in Noyabrsk at the end of August 2014. Sports and recreational activities and master classes on traditional crafts and other forms of art were held, and there were performances by local singers and musicians. The Company plans to roll the project out across the other regions in which it operates.
The Company provides financial support to the D.D. Shostakovich St. Petersburg Academic 
Philharmonia, the Russian Geographical Society, and historical shipyards.
During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft became a general partner of the IT'S TIME! International 
Festival of Social Communications, which has been held in Omsk since 2007 and is one of the biggest social advertising events in Russia and the CIS, attracting leading experts and specialists in the field. The IT'S TIME festival is designed to facilitate the development of regional social communications in order to deal with pressing social problems. One challenge is to stem the outflow of young people from the city. 
Gazprom Neft is a long-time partner of one of Yugra’s key cultural events: the Spirit of Fire Debut

By implementing a large-scale Personal Contribution programme, Gazprom Neft has been able to 
transition from spontaneous volunteering initiatives to the systematic development of corporate volunteering.
Gazprom Neft's volunteering movement is being rolled out in 38 Russian cities, involving more 
than 7,500 people. In 2014, Company volunteers took part in 188 events, including blood donation, support for orphanages and boarding schools, clean-up initiatives, tree planting, and other environmental measures aimed at making life in the cities more comfortable and enjoyable. The Company has a tradition of organizing sports, educational, and entertainment activities for children in homes and providing them with targeted assistance, for instance, helping them get ready for the new school year, preparing New Year gifts for them, and organizing celebrations on Children's Day. As part of the Nearest and Dearest mutual assistance fund, employees managed to raise about RUB 18 million during the reporting year.
Company employees have been implementing the Learning is Interesting project for children in 
orphanages and boarding schools since 2013. The project includes a series of educational measures designed to offer children careers advice and help them to achieve their potential. 
To implement its volunteer programmes, the Company cooperates with NPOs and charitable 
foundations. A regular Gazprom Neft partner is the April Charitable Foundation, which has helped the Company to conduct the Spring Sports campaign every year since 2012 in Leningrad Region, organizing sporting tournaments for orphanages and boarding schools. In 2014, more than 160 participants, including children with disabilities, participated in these competitions. Zenit footballer Oleg Shatov personally presented cups to the winners of Spring Sports 2014. Around 60 Gazprom Neft employees and family members took part. In December 2014, the Company held its first volunteer forum. The most active Company volunteers attended the event, which was dedicated to sharing experience and reviewing the year’s events. The participants were addressed by Chairman of the Management Board Alexander Dyukov. During the forum, participants learned about the best projects conducted by their colleagues in the regions. Guest experts talked about general volunteering trends in the world and in Russia, different companies’ approaches to volunteering, and ongoing initiatives. During the event, the most active Company volunteers received awards."Gazprom Neft's volunteer movement is an important part of our Home Towns programme, and it reflects the vital philosophy of our company. The projects attract people who really do want to help. Some of them help children, while others support environmental projects or give blood or donate money to help people in distress. It is very important to remember that all this is done outside work, at the employees’ own initiative, and with no compensation of any sort from the Company. These people deserve special recognition from the Company."
ALEXANDER DYBAL
GAZPROM NEFT DEPUTY CEO, 
CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS
"The school sports tournaments are 
particular important to me, since that was where I discovered volunteering a year ago. These games are really fun for the children. They give them the chance to do something different, interact with their peers, express themselves, and show what they are capable of. It is just as important for them to understand that there are many caring people around who want to give them their attention, smiles, warmth, and companionship."

for myself. Kerzhakov, Hulk, and Lodygin are my idols. I try not to miss a single game when they’re on the field. Meeting their head coach was a surprise. I didn’t expect him to be so friendly. He must love children. I was happy!" ARTEM LYARSKY
