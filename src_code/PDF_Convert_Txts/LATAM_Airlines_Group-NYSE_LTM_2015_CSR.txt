REPORT 2015
Dear shareholders,
2015 was the most challenging year in the 
history of LA TAM and its aﬃliates airlines operate, local currencies depreciated; thus impacting our revenues and costs related to the import of goods and services. Moreover, we faced a huge economic and political crisis in Brazil, our largest market; which strongly impacted the civil aviation sector. The country faced the largest recession of its modern history; resulting in a contraction of GDP , 
increased unemployment and a fall in real 
wages. This has had a signiﬁcant impact on the 
wealth of individuals and companies, with the 
troubles in the political environment aﬀecting 
expectations, thus exacerbating the damage to 
the macroeconomic scenario.
This highly challenging scenario in the largest 
market explains the 219 million dollars loss that LA TAM reported in 2015, which could have been worse if it wasn’t mitigated by the strong performance of the Spanish speaking markets. It’s worth highlighting that LA TAM met its operating margin forecast of 5%, with the most adverse impact on currency depreciation, mainly in Brazil.
Notwithstanding the above, LA TAM Airlines 
Group retained its leadership in the main MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORSmarkets in which we operate, such as Chile 
and Peru. In 2015 the seat capacity (ASKs) was reduced by 2.5% in Brazil’s domestic operation and renegotiated our aircraft deliveries, which resulted in the cancellation of nearly 40% of our ﬂeet commitments through 2018 and an investment reduction of 2.9 billion dollars. We are aware of future challenges, and in 2016 we will continue to adapt TAM’s network with an 
important additional reduction of 8% to 10% in 
seat capacity in the Brazilian domestic market as well as downsizing the international market from Brazil, especially to the United States. Therefore, 2015 will be remembered as the year where LA TAM demonstrated its ability to respond to challenging economic scenarios.
We continue to consolidate the leadership in 
our main hubs – Guarulhos, Brasilia, Lima and Santiago – which will enable us to develop our network and oﬀer the broader range of destinations to our passengers. Proof of this is the thirteen regional and international routes that were announced during the year, including connections between Brasilia and Montevideo (JJ), Punta Cana and Buenos Aires (4M) and Lima to Montevideo (LP), Antofagasta and Washington D.C.(LP)
I would like to highlight the ‘joint business 
agreements’ negotiated in 2015 between LA TAM and IAG (controlling holding company of British Airways and Iberia) and American Airlines (AA), one of the leading airlines in 
the United States. Once approved by the 
corresponding authorities, we will have access 
to a broad network of connections in important hubs in the United States and Europe. With 
these agreements, we have the possibility to open a large network of destinations and oﬀer further advantages to our customers, such as the unique ticket sales and improved travel experiences. This was only possible because of our unrivalled ﬂight network and connections within South America.
Finally, I wouldn’t like to end this message with 
announcing our new brand, LA TAM Airlines. Since the beginning we knew that the best way to merge the diﬀerent hispanic and Brazilian cultures would be through a new brand, a decision that we have arrived to after long discussions and breaking of paradigms, because a new brand has never been created from a merger or association of airlines in the history of aviation. It wasn’t an easy decision, because the replacement of powerful and historic brands such as LAN and TAM required courage. It was also a logical decision, because the merger will generate economies of scale in the long run with the process simpliﬁcation in virtually every area.
In 2016, our plan is to expand LA TAM Group’s 
leading position in Latin America, ﬂying to new destinations with our unique identity and the same strength to overcome problems and grow in a proﬁtable way.
Y ours sincerely,Mauricio Amaro

Dear shareholders,
The consolidation of LA TAM as one of the 
leading airlines in Latin America in terms of quality and service has been a priority over the last few years. We believe that the only way to be successful is to oﬀer a distinctive value proposal to our passengers. Being only a step away from a huge accomplishment – the launch of our new brand – we are still convinced that we have the right strategy to achieve our goal 
of positioning LA TAM among the best airlines in 
the world.
I would like to take this opportunity to inform 
you about all the work we’ve done over the 
last year. Introducing LA TAM has meant 
change; changes that have opened a world of 
possibilities and allowed us to reestablish a new culture with the customer and place them at the center of every strategic plan. LA TAM has not only brought together the best of LAN and TAM stories, but also it has ampliﬁed them on a large scale to deliver our clients much more than the sum of their parts.
We have made these changes in a highly 
complex and challenging regional scenario, which encourages us to be eﬃcient, take care of our cost structure and to prioritse our strategies. We have focused on initiatives that MESSAGE 
FROM THE CEOallow us to build a distinctive oﬀer. We oﬀer the 
best network of destinations, a state-of-the-art digital experience and a team that directs its eﬀorts towards satisfying our customers; which will guarantee our future growth.
In this vein, we continue working to enhance 
our ﬂight network and connections within South America, thus oﬀering our passengers an unparalleled connectivity in the region. LA TAM Group will continue to focus on strengthening the main hubs, allowing us to reinforce the 
group’s connectivity in Latin America, North 
America, the Caribbean, Europe and now Africa.
During 2015, we invested more than US$50 
million in the implementation of digital advances that have allowed us to improve the passenger ﬂight experience, oﬀer better service before and after the ﬂight and improve our how our employees work. Through this investment we look forward to creating a unique ﬂight experience and a competitive advantage for LA TAM Group. Some of the innovations that stood out during the year were: the implementation of a new onboard wireless entertainment system that enables 
passengers to watch movies, series and videos 
through their own mobile devices; as well 
as a new smartphone application, oﬀering 
electronic boarding passes. Additionally, three thousand tablets were delivered to LA TAM Group employees; to help improve our service quality, whether directly or indirectly.
I also want to highlight our daily commitment 
to be a transparent and responsible airline group to our customers and investors and at 
the same time provides a valuable contribution to Latin America. For the second consecutive year, we were one of only two airline groups worldwide to be listed in the Dow Jones World 
Sustainability Index, placing us among a select 
group of companies for sustainability based on long-term economic, social and environmental criteria.We have worked with conviction and passion, giving our best to get to this stage. Along with thanking our shareholders, I would like to acknowledge over 50,000 people from diﬀerent nationalities that work for LA TAM Group, whose eﬀort and dedication has been crucial for this unique and historic project. LA TAM is a global operator and is preparing to compete in the major leagues of the airline business worldwide, therefore generating value for our shareholders, stakeholders and the society as a whole.

In 2015, the airline group transported more than 67 million passengers and carried a million metric tons of cargo between 29 countries. LA TAM Airlines Group S.A. is the new name given in 2012 to LAN Airlines S.A. as a result of its association with TAM S.A. It has 50,413 
employees and a ﬂeet of 331 aircraft  , one 
of the youngest and most modern in the industry, with an average age of seven years. G4-3, G4-4, G4-6, G4-8, G4-9
A key diﬀ  erential is the airline group’s 
wide-ranging network of 150 destinations, connecting Latin America, the Caribbean, North America, Europe and Asia Paciﬁc. LA TAM and its aﬃ   liates airlines also 
operate in the seven largest domestic 
markets (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru), accounting 
for half of the passenger trafﬁc within 
South America. Based on a strategy of hubs 
in key airports, the company facilitates connections within the region and worldwide. Examples of this strategy are the airports in Guarulhos, São Paulo (Brazil), and Lima (Peru).The airline group’s connectivity is boosted 
by its participation in the oneworld global alliance, comprising 15 airlines that ﬂy to 
150 countries. This alliance gives LA TAM 
passengers access to 117 destinations in Latin America, 435 in North America, 395 in Europe and more than 800 in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

SINGLE BRAND
In the second half of 2015 LA TAM announced its new brand, aimed at conveying some of the 
company’s key att  ributes visually, such as its commitment to efﬁciency, caring for people and 
strong identiﬁcation with Latin America. Inspired by the geographical outline of the continent, work on applying the new brand was initiated in 2016 in the airline group’s physical spaces, aircraft  , commercial units and communication channels. The change in corporate image will be 
carried out gradually, with completion scheduled for 2018.
Between the association of LAN and TAM and the launch of the single brand, three years were 
spent on research into stakeholders and scenario studies in ten countries representing strategic markets or activity bases. The process took the history airlines, the expertise developed over decades of activities and the synergies which justiﬁed the association into account.

THE COMPANY :  SUPPLIERS
In 2015, LA TAM progressed in the global 
alignment of parameters for goods and services acquisition and supplier management, consolidating its Procurement and Supply Chain Policy, which takes the group’s Code of Ethics and anti-corruption policy into account, in addition to speciﬁc regulatory requirements for the diﬀ  erent countries in which the com-

It sets forth the principles governing relations with suppliers, with particular focus on risk reduction, ethics, legal compliance and social and environmental criteria. In the course of the year, the procedures and framework agreements to be adopted by the company were also validated.
These initiatives are part of LA TAM’s eﬀ  ort to 
standardize its activities and were undertaken in parallel with the redeﬁnition of the corpo-rate procurement structure. T o streamline processes and drive efﬁciency, all the organi-zation’s purchases were grouped in categories and responsibilities assigned to speciﬁc areas.

REPORT 2015
MANAGING THE CHAIN
The establishment of a global procurement 
and supply chain policy enabled LA TAM to standardize the ﬁnancial, social and environmental criteria used to select and monitor suppliers and to enhance risk management throughout the chain. Partners are systematically submitted to monitoring based on a matrix which takes into account the most relevant risks for each supplier 
category, encompassing aspects such as level 
of ﬁnancial solvency, compliance with labor and ﬁscal standards, sanitary requirements, ethical conduct, as well as human rights and social and environmental best practices. In 2016, the organization is planning to adopt an IT tool which will permit it to check LA TAM suppliers against international databases and blacklists of companies involved in money laundering, fraud, ﬁnancing terrorism, crimes against humanity, and the exploitation of child or slave labor.
Supplier management also takes into 
account speciﬁc potential risks and impacts in determined value chains, identiﬁed from a mapping exercise conducted in Brazil in 2013 and updated by the company in 2015. The potential risks identiﬁed include degrading working conditions at apparel suppliers, health and safety in catering supply, the physical safety of crew members and passengers in transportation and hotel 
accommodation and environmental impacts 
caused by inadequate waste management 
on the part of fuel, tire and infrastructure 
suppliers, for example.  EN33  – LA15  – HR11All company suppliers submit to the company 
Code of Conduct, which addresses questions such as ethical conduct, anti-corruption practices, occupational health and safety, human rights – and more speciﬁcally child and slave labor –, working conditions, as well as social and environmental responsibility. Furthermore, contracts contain speciﬁc clauses on compliance with environmental requirements, with performance monitored by audits. Environmental criteria are incorporated into the selection of partners: ranging from the measurement and management of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efﬁciency and initiatives to ensure the reduction and proper disposal of waste, in particular hazardous varieties. The criteria were already being applied to certain speciﬁc procurement categories and were extended to the entire supply chain.
The company conducts audits on third-
parties and sub-contractors regarding labor obligations, overtime and equipment maintenance.
Periodic audits are also carried out on 
suppliers considered to be critical, such as those providing aircraft parts, aviation fuel, airport equipment and passenger back up and tracking systems. Suppliers of products and services that have a high cost, that are not easy to substitute or that could potentially aﬀect operational continuity are considered to be critical.
FOCUS ON MICRO 
AND SMALL COMPANIES
In 2015, LAN Colombia launched its Micro and 
Small Company program (MyP , in the Spanish acronym), aimed at forging closer relations with these suppliers and promoting their development. Payment policy was modiﬁed re-sulting in payment terms reduced to at most 30 days, attuned with the ﬁnancial reality of these companies. Additionally, a speciﬁc communi-
cation channel through which they may make comments, complaints and clarify doubts was created in the supplier portal. All contacts via the channel receive a response in at most ﬁve days. The volume of business LAN Colombia did with micro and small companies totaled over US$ 2.1 million in 2015. EC7   ENVIRONMENTAL 
CLAUSE
“Once selected, the supplier must 
sign a contract, which contains an environmental clause. By this clause, providers are compelled to comply with all environmental legal requirements and to take responsibility for any sanctions in this regard. Also, contractors are bound by this clause to safeguard the environment and to 
avoid actions that may harm it, taking any 
preventive measures needed. The clause applies to all types of providers, especially those working with hydrocarbons, fuels, efﬂuent discharges, atmospheric pollutants and waste, in particular hazardous varieties.
Also, by this clause the supplier agrees to:a. Report any event that may cause real 
or potential environmental damage to the clientb. In the event of an environmental incident, to act strictly in accordance with the guidelines provided by the client (LA TAM Airlines Group or any of its subsidiaries), including the application of controls and mitigation measures.
c. Heed the observations and apply 
the corrective or preventive measures proposed by the client or any other inspection authority.
d. Provide all the information requested 
by the Client to facilitate audits and 
veriﬁcation of compliance with client 
guidelines and environmental regulations.Suppliers’ failure to comply with this clause may result in termination of the contract. ”Source: LA TAM standard contract

THE COMPANY : RELA TIONS WITH 
STRA TEGIC STAKEHOLDERS
LA TAM has always sought to turn its 
interactions with its diverse stakeholders into opportunities for joint development. In the course of 2015, the company developed a tool to leverage this process systematically: the Corporate Stakeholder Relationship Policy. The document applies to all LA TAM units and will be submitted for approval by the Board of Directors in 2016.
The policy objectively sets forth the criteria 
to be used in identifying and prioritizing 
stakeholders, taking into account the 
speciﬁc context, company guidelines, topics considered to be material in managing sustainability, potential impacts and the power of inﬂuence of each group. As such, this policy beﬁts the dynamic nature of these relationships and the growing trend towards demands for information, transparency and a 
proactive stance on the part of the company 
and will be used periodically to review the list 
of stakeholder groups.
Roles and responsibilities were determined 
within the company for the execution of 
structured engagement plans, tracking 
progress against the goals and targets 
established by means of performance indicators. The process will be overseen by the Corporate Aﬀairs area and executed under a matrix structure by the diverse company areas, such as Finance, Marketing, Legal, Compliance, Human Resources, Investor 
Relations, Airports and Procurement, among others. The goal is to promote dialogue 
around subjects of common interest and 
to transparently reinforce the company’s positioning on pertinent questions for the aviation industry.
Based on the policy, LA TAM undertook the 
mapping of the 19 stakeholders groups with which it maintains relations. From these, seven strategic groups were prioritized – public and regulatory authorities, primary suppliers, unions, communication media, passenger clients, employees and investors. Action plans were drawn up and relationship channels deﬁned in accordance with the diﬀerent proﬁles.  G4-24 – G4-25
The Corporate Stakeholder Relationship 
Policy is aligned with the international commitments assumed by LA TAM and with the references the company uses in managing the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the business. Worthy of note among these are: the ISO 26000 social responsibility standard; initiatives such as the Global Compact’s Sustainable Development Goals; the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

MARKET RELA TIONS
The Investor Relations area oversees 
relations with LA TAM shareholders and other capital market agents, adopting a transparent communication policy that employs speciﬁc channels. The group´s ﬁnancial and governance information is made available in English, Spanish and Portuguese on the website  http://www.latamairlinesgroup.net . 
 
The company presents its results on a quarterly basis by means of reports and teleconferences organized by the Investor Relations area and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (CFO).
CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT 
The LA TAM Airlines Group’s corporate governance practices are subject to constant review in order to ensure that its internal self-regulatory processes are fully aligned with the regulations in force and with company values. Decision making and commercial activities are underpinned by the principles of ethics and business conduct set forth in the LATAM Code 
of Conduct. Published in 2014, the code consolidates the guidelines set forth in the LAN and TAM codes, providing uniﬁed orientation for the entire company and guidelines for relations with relevant stakeholder groups. G4-56For example, the document explicitly 
sets forth LA TAM’s positioning and expectations in terms of employee conduct in relations with government or company representatives, prohibiting the acceptance of gratiﬁcations or the oﬀer of irregular payments. Regarding contracts or ﬁnancial contributions in the name of the group to charity campaigns, social or political causes, the Code determines that the express, prior authorization of the company’s Board of Directors is necessary.
All suppliers and all employees must 
sign a T erm of Commitment in which they undertake to observe the guidelines set forth in the Code; the company also 
promotes periodic training sessions 
on the code for employees. In 2015, all employees received communications on ethical conduct and legal compliance, 
and 89% took part in speciﬁc courses. A 
total of 42,300 employees were trained, 
including almost one thousand working 
in sensitive areas and more than 1,700 leaders. SO4
Additionally, a Compliance Month was 
organized during each semester aimed 
at providing information and raising consciousness in this area, as well as publicizing the company’s new Ethics website on a massive scale. The internal channels for reports on breaches of laws and internal standards of professional and personal conduct were consolidated in a single channel, covering matters ranging 
from compliance with the company’s Code of Ethics, to labor issues and questions involving discrimination, harassment,  
as well as all types of fraud, corruption  
or bribery.
The channel is operated by a third-
party provider to ensure independence and probity in the analysis of and response to all reports. All incidents are analyzed and forwarded to investigative committees in each country. In the event of any irregularity, the Code of Conduct Administration Committee, comprising the Human Resources, Compliance, Legal and other areas in each location, decides on the measures to be taken.
Internal compliance and accountability 
policies are aligned with the legal requirements for companies with shares traded on the New Y ork, Santiago and São Paulo stock exchanges. The Legal area has staﬀ responsible for supporting the LA TAM Chief Compliance Ofﬁcer in each country (Brazil, Chile, United States, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador) and in Europe.

GOVERNANCE: RISK 
MANAGEMENT
Risk management is a strategic pillar for the 
LA TAM Airlines Group, subject to ongoing improvement. Based on work begun in 2014, LA TAM has been focusing more closely on cross-cutt  ing risks – those involving 
more than one category – and on the early detection of emerging ones. This approach constitutes a strategic complement to the functional risk monitoring and management system in operation throughout the 
diﬀ erent company areas, overseen by the 
respective heads.
In 2015, the CRO’s (Chief Risk Ofﬁcer) 
team created to support this pillar led the mapping and construction of a strategic risk matrix, which takes into account the probability of occurrence and the potential impact (in economic and reputational terms) of each type of risk. These are 
monitored systematically by the company 
from an integrated standpoint, using a 
single methodology.
This work also enabled the construction of 
a Corporate Risk Policy, approved by the 
Board of Directors at the end of 2015 for 
implementation in 2016.MONITORING
At the highest level of governance, 
strategic cross-cutt  ing and emerging 
risks are monitored regularly by the Risk 
Committ  ee, which reports to the Board of 
Directors. At the executive level, there is a Risk Desk coordinated by the CRO, with the participation of managers from diﬀ  erent 
areas and selected guests. The idea is to encourage a more holistic vision of any issues, to see how the impacts interrelate and to seek opportunities for synergy. The assessment incorporates economic, social and environmental matt  ers.
The plans for 2016 entail extending the 
approach adopted at corporate level to the local operations in order to integrate the main strategic risks identiﬁed in the subsidiaries. The company also intends to advance in the consolidation of an internal risk management culture, ensuring the entire team is aware of the potential impacts each decision may have on overall results.
Among the emerging risks identiﬁed 
by the company, worthy of note are possible ﬁnancial impacts in the medium term resulting from more restrictive atmospheric emission standards legislation and the propagation of communicable diseases, which in extreme situations could aﬀ ect demand for services. T o minimize these risks, LA TAM acts in conjunction 
with the competent authorities, conducts communication and preventive campaigns in the event of epidemics, in addition to incorporating these factors into its emergency response plans.

STRA TEGY : BUILDING THE 
FUTURE
For LA TAM Airlines Group, achieving its 
aspiration of being one the three biggest airlines groups in the world involves much more than mere numbers that demonstrate its ﬁnancial performance, ﬂeet excellence, destinations map and service quality. The airline group’s vision is based on relationship dynamics and businesses which are sustained over time and generate shared value for shareholders, the market, 
employees, clients, suppliers and society as 
a whole, and upon which the future is built one day at a time, in the present.
Five strategic pillars established in 2014 
drive the company’s internal dynamics and its teams’ eﬀ  orts geared towards achieving 
the LA TAM future vision. These are:
Leadership in destination network: its 
extensive network of destinations within 
South America, and connectivity with 
the rest of the world are at the heart of 
LA TAM strategy and constitute a major appeal for clients and potential partners. In addition to consolidating domestic and international hubs in key airports in which the company operates directly, LA TAM invests in agreements to expand the possibilities oﬀ ered to clients. This is exempliﬁed by 
the agreements signed at the beginning of 2016 with American Airlines and with the International Airlines Group (IAG), comprising British Airways and Iberia, which added 420 destinations in Europe, the United States, 
Canada and South America to the network. Both agreements are subject to government approval.
Leading brand and client experience:  in 
2015, a LA TAM launched its new brand, which uniﬁes the LAN and TAM brands consolidating the strong association with 
the Latin American continent, which is the 
heartland of company operations. More than just a graphic symbol, the new brand stands for the internal cultural transformation the company has been undergoing since the merger and is fully att  uned with the renewal 
of its value proposition for clients and its diﬀ erentiation strategies. This is manifest 
in the Twist project, which is changing the way the company relates with its clients and involves heavy investment in digital technology.
Cost competiveness:  the commitment to 
efﬁciency fundamental to any operation gains even greater relevance given the challenges posed by the current macroeconomic conjuncture. Diligence in ﬁnancial management, a focus on operational excellence and ﬁne tuning ﬂeet investment plans are some of the elements in this pillar. The target is a 5% reduction in total operational costs by 2018.Organizational strength:  technical capacity 
and employee engagement underpin all LA TAM’s work. In 2015, the company invested heavily in process simpliﬁcation, in strengthening leadership roles and in adapting internal structures, aimed at avoiding duplication and overlap and driving efﬁciency.
Risk management:  a more strategic and 
systemic approach was adopted, incorporating the mapping and consolidation of new dynamics for monitoring cross-cutt  ing and 
emerging risks. The process involves diﬀ  erent 
areas and all levels and is aimed at establishing an internal decision making culture which takes the correlations and potential impacts of each initiative into account on a broad basis.
Combined in a matrix with the topics 
covered by Corporate Sustainability Strategy, these pillars are translated into the initiatives executed by the diﬀ  erent 
company areas on a day to day basis.

OPERA TIONAL RESUL TS
LA TAM maintained its leadership position 
in 2015 in spite of the challenging economic conjuncture, marked by a downturn in economic growth and the devaluation of local currencies in South America, particularly in Brazil. The company managed to increase operating margin by 1 percentage point (p.p.) compared with 2014, reaching 5.1%, with an operating income of US$ 513.9 million. It also maintained an adequate level of liquidity, ending the year with US$ 1.361 billion in cash and cash equivalents, corresponding to 13.4% of net revenue for the preceding 12 months.
The company’s resilience to 
macroeconomic difﬁculties is due to its diversiﬁed commercial model, rigorous expense management, adjustments in the ﬂeet plan and its agility in adapting to lower demand by reducing capacity in the domestic and international markets in Brazil. The cost reduction strategy generated savings of around US$ 325 million in the year, higher than the original expectation; the target is to reach a 5% reduction by 2018. In addition to increased efﬁciency, operating costs were positively impacted by the devaluation of local currencies, with an 11.5% reduction in cost per ASK -equivalent (excluding fuel) in 2015.Pursue synergies in cost and asset management

In 2015, passenger and cargo revenues accounted respectively for 83.1% and 13.1% of total operating revenue.
Demand in the Spanish-speaking countries 
– Chile, Peru, Argentina, Colombia and 
Ecuador – continued to grow at a modest 
rate in the fourth quarter of 2015, with a 5.3% increase in passenger trafﬁc measured in RPK , ending the year at 17,858. Passenger capacity, measured in ASK, increased 2 5.5% in the year, driven by growth in Peru and Argentina, together with a 0.2 percentage point rise in the occupancy rate, which reached 81.5%.
On a global level, the company’s total 
capacity increased by 3.1%, driven by 6.4% growth in the international routes, focused on strengthening the hubs and routes to the Caribbean. Domestic capacity in the Spanish-language markets grew 4.8%, mainly due to Colombia and Peru; there was a decrease in the routes between Brazil and the United States.

The LA TAM brand and service quality are 
diﬀ erentials for the company. T o reinforce 
these and take relationship to the next level, LA TAM is working on a number of initiatives aimed at enhancing the client experience across a broad spectrum that goes beyond the time spent in the air. Investments in technology, new communication platforms, a client-focused 
service culture and rewards programs are 
some of the instruments the company uses to forge closer ties with passengers at all points of interaction, ranging from the website, stores, contact centers to airports and in ﬂight services.
The airline group invests constantly in 
digital technology to improve connectivity with clients and facilitate access to its services. Passengers may buy tickets, reserve their seats, check in and get their boarding pass via the company website and mobile phone apps. In 2015, new features were introduced such as ﬂight status, with real-time information on whether a ﬂight is on time or late, with explanations about any delays and expected arrival and 
departure times.
In the second half of the year, an option 
permitt  ing LAN clients to reschedule 
delayed or cancelled ﬂights by means of 
a chat available in the application was 
enabled. The service helped to reduce the 
impact of an air trafﬁc controllers’ strike in 
Chile in the second half of the year. Around 
31,300 LAN passengers were notiﬁed about the risk of delays or cancellations by SMS or email, and 13,700 (44%) used the chat to seek alternatives. The majority of accesses (70%) were by mobile phone, and 26.4% used the service via computer. This feature will be extended to TAM in 2016.
In addition to pre-boarding services, during 
the ﬂight passengers have access to the 
LAN and TAM entertainment menu and 
information via an application for mobile phones, tablets and notebooks.

CUL TURAL CHANGE PROJECT
T o leverage a new across-the-board service 
culture, LA TAM has launched a cultural change project. This process was initiated with pilot projects in two locations: Brasilia airport, in Brazil, the fourth largest in the LA TAM operational region, and in the Estado Contact Center in Santiago, Chile, operated by a team of around 500 people. The ﬁrst step was to identify speciﬁc work 
details, the way the teams are organized, 
the demand ﬂow, client proﬁles and needs in the two units. The proposal was to elaborate the global strategy and act locally, adapting it to speciﬁc requirements and possibilities.
During three months, the transformation 
teams implemented changes in the operational routines and monitored the results. There were over 40 initiatives, ranging from rethinking how company policies are applied and how tasks and responsibilities are divided among the team to the adoption of tools to monitor client satisfaction in real time. A key element in the project was higher employee engagement stemming from increased 
decision making autonomy.The project results were highly positive 
in the three dimensions in which it is monitored: client satisfaction; employee engagement and productivity. In the Contact Center, for example, productivity increased by 20%; the number of satisﬁed clients grew 12% while dissatisﬁed clients decreased by 33%. At Brasilia airport, service efﬁciency was up by 12% (based on the average number of clients served per employee). Employee satisfaction, measured on a daily basis, grew 40%.
The initiative is being extended to the rest 
of the service network in 2016. Twist is already underway in the LA TAM service units at the Galeão and Santos Dumont airports in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Miami (United States) and at the airport and contact center in Lima (Peru). By the end of 2016, the project will have been implemented at all the contact centers and around 70% of the airports used by the company.

In the cargo operation, the methodology used is the total satisfaction rate, which takes into account diﬀerent aspects of the service. The rating in 2015 was 77%, 6 percentage points up on 2014, beating the target (74%) set for the period. The improvement in the rate is due to the action plans adopted by the company based on the results of the previous survey and the focus on factors such as reservation fulﬁllment, reduction in Contact Center and customer service response times, cargo delivery conditions and the ﬁt between cargo capacity/ destination network and client needs. In terms of individual operations, the leaders are Quito (83%), New Y ork (82%) and Miami (81%). The operations in Europe had an average score of 82%, compared with 77% in Latin America.T o oﬀer a more complete view of client perceptions, the calculation also includes passengers whose ﬂights suﬀered delays. At TAM, the survey is conducted among participants in the TAM Fidelidade program, while LAN takes into account both LANPASS clients and passengers not in the loyalty program.

ENVIRONMENT : ENVIRONMENTAL 
ASPECTS AND CLIMA TE CHANGE
In absolute terms, air transportation 
accounts for only 2% of greenhouse gas emissions related to human activity, according to data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Around 80% of the sector’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are related to ﬂights of over 1,500 kilometers, journeys for which air travel is the most eﬃcient alternative
3. In spite of the limited relevance 
in terms of global emissions, the potential eﬀects of aviation on climate change represent the industry’s main environmental impact and are the target of coordinated eﬀorts and voluntary public commitments.
In the list of topics considered to be 
material by LA TAM, the environmental component of sustainability management is a constant. In the process of elaborating this report, three of the nine relevant topics are related to environmental impacts and are addressed from a perspective of mitigating climate change and capacity to adapt to it. This is a topic that can have a profound eﬀect both on the proﬁtability and execution of the company’s operations. The LA TAM risk management system has detected risks arising from the growth in regulations aimed at controlling climate change, and over the past year the company has been engaged in the implementation of its climate change strategy, pursuing several 
lines of action.
The LA TAM environmental management 
system was designed to reduce the company’s impacts on climate change and to improve its capacity to adapt to changes in weather patterns and in the regulatory environment. This also permits LA TAM to track and follow up on the targets established, facilitating management of its material issues.
JET FUEL
The main source of GHG emissions in aviation is fuel consumption, and by means of constant investment in technology and the improvement of procedures, the operation has been driving eﬃciency gains year on year. Relative fuel consumption (measured in RTK
4) has decreased on 
average by 70% since the birth of the air travel industry
5. Flights have also become 
more eﬃcient in terms of emissions: while total passenger numbers have grown by around 5%, the annual increase in emissions is approximately 3%.
With its Fuel Eﬃciency Program, LA TAM 
economized 38.4 million gallons of fuel in 2015, avoiding 366,500 tons of CO2e emissions. Since fuel is also one of the main resources used in the operation, eﬃcient management has a direct impact on costs. The company has also committed to putting a price on its carbon footprint 
in order to inﬂuence investment decisions and to drive down greenhouse gas emissions.
EMISSIONS
LA TAM is a member of the main discussion forums on climate change and collaborates with a number of group initiatives to improve environmental performance in aviation. The company is the leader in eﬃcient fuel use and is committed to the International Air Transportation Association’s (IA TA) Carbon-Neutral Growth (CNG2020) initiative. An

unprecedented proposal, CNG2020 is 
a voluntary commitment under which, from 2020 airlines will oﬀset all sector emissions exceeding average emissions in the baseline period 2018-2020 until the company achieves its emissions reduction target.
LA TAM is working towards becoming 
carbon neutral in its ground operations. Since 2012, the company has reduced annual emissions by 12% and oﬀset a 
further 7%. An example of this eﬀort is 
Colombia, which oﬀset all its emissions from ground operations in 2014. This involved the purchase of carbon credits from the REDD Chocó Forest Conservation project in the Darién region, close to the Panamanian border. Emissions measurement was veriﬁed externally by the Spanish Association for Standardization and Certiﬁcation, AENOR.
COMPLIANCE
Other environmental management aspects of the operation are also taken into account in long-term planning. The proliferation of regulations governing air quality and noise levels constitute a critical issue for LA TAM performance standards. There is also concern related to urban growth. These days, more and more housing developments are located closer to airports, increasing public exposure to aircraft noise. It is 
important that urban development plans take this into consideration in order not to restrict air industry growth.Currently, the LA TAM ﬂeet is compliant with the ICAO Chapter IV Standard, the most rigorous noise standard in the aviation industry, and the company is engaged in diverse initiatives to improve its performance in this area. In recent years, it has withdrawn aircraft generating higher 
noise levels from the ﬂeet, including the 
A340, replacing it with models such as the B787 and the new Airbus A350, which will 
come into operation in 2016. These new aircraft generate up to 40% less noise than similar models. Even so, the company aims to decrease noise generation further by investing in more modern and silent aircraft and engines and by implementing operational best practices, such as continuous descent approaches and one-engine taxiing; technological developments, like RNP; and on ground initiatives, such as minimizing the use of APUs in airports.

LA TAM is the world leader in eﬃcient fuel use. 
Measured in RTK6, its operations consume 10% less fuel than the average for members of IA TA7, which has 260 aﬃliates and represents 83% of all international air traﬃc. EN27
In addition to the direct environmental 
beneﬁts of reduced non-renewable fuel consumption and the corresponding decrease in climate change impacts, the increased operational eﬃciency generates ﬁnancial 
gains for the company. In 2015, the measures 
enabled savings of 38.4 million gallons of fuel, which translates into a cost avoidance of US$ 79.1 million.
The airline group’s robust environmental 
performance also represents a diﬀerential in terms of attractiveness compared with competitors. Around 25% of cargo service revenues come from customers that use

Eﬃciency in fuel use
The LAN and TAM eﬃciency programs were uniﬁed in the LA TAM Fuel Eﬃciency Program in 2015. In addition to investing in consolidating a culture of eﬃciency and an environmentally responsible mindset within the team to ensure the maintenance of existing initiatives (see box), management at corporate level drove new synergies and an advance in the company’s strategic approach.
The management and operational procedures 
determined in the new program enabled total savings of 38.4 million gallons of fuel in the year. On average, the fuel eﬃciency of the company has improved by 2.5% per year compared to 2012 levels
8.The new measures adopted in 2015 involve three main focuses. T ogether with the Operations and Safety areas, the procedure for activating exterior lighting during approach and landing operations was reviewed, and with the lighting being turned on only at lower altitudes, when it is really necessary. In addition to the direct impact on energy consumption by the actual lighting system, the modiﬁcation reduces the time the aircraft is submitted to the aerodynamic resistance caused by the equipment.
In an operation involving the Maintenance 
area there was a review of the protocol for activating the airplanes’ auxiliary power unit (APU), used to operate the doors and the

air conditioning on the ground. Software 
developed by the company enabled the mapping of situations in which the equipment was turned on during maintenance processes, identifying unnecessary waste. Through initiatives to boost team awareness and investments in infrastructure improvements, including external power sources, it was possible to reduce waste in the use of the 
APUs at all stages of maintenance.
Lastly, the airline group also enhanced global 
management of inspection and maintenance 
activities, which were coordinated with ﬂight operations. This integrated planning helped reduce the need to relocate planes from one city to another exclusively for purposes of inspection, ensuring alignment between inspections and cargo or passenger transportation operations.
These three measures were incorporated into 
LA TAM’s routines, complementing the fuel eﬃciency initiatives already in use, which are described in the box below.MAIN ACTIONS

LA TAM has developed construction and building enablement manuals based in Green Building criteria, taking into account environmental matters, and is now working in implementing the in the infrastructure plan of the company. 
The company constantly develops programs 
to drive the rational use of water and energy. In terms of waste management, LA TAM takes measures to guarantee that the largest quantity possible of waste material remains in the production chain, and when this is not possible, it ensures adequate disposal.
Even though the overall electricity 
consumption increased compared with 2014, we have developed several initiatives in 2015.
One of the initiatives adopted to reduce power 
consumption was the modernization of the lighting at headquarters in Santiago, Chile. The light bulbs were replaced with more eﬃcient models, driving a reduction in consumption of over 20%.
Also, in Colombia, an eco-eﬃciency and 
employee environmental awareness project is underway at the company’s three oﬃces in the capital, Bogota. A diagnosis conducted 
in 2015 identiﬁed potential energy savings of 
around 8%.Considering all energy sources, LA TAM

Over the years LA TAM has conducted three 
ﬂ ights using biofuels. In 2010, LAN Airlines 
carried out a test ﬂ  ight prior to ASTM 
certiﬁ  cation of this fuel; in 2012 it pioneered 
the use of biofuel in a commercial ﬂ  ight in 
South America with a ﬂ  ight in Chile; and in 2013 
it was responsible for the ﬁ  rst commercial 
ﬂ ight in Colombia.
LA TAM adopts the positioning that the 
concept of alternative energies in aviation 
should not be limited to biofuels, but 
rather extended to include all sustainable fuels. With this goal, the airline group has been active on a number of fronts, such as conducting studies on the eco-eﬃ   ciency of 
biofuels and the potential for using them in diﬀ erent regions, promoting seminars and 
debates with authorities in the countries in which it operates, as well as monitoring the development of alternative fuels worldwide. Through TAM, the company is a member of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG).
In spite of these eﬀ  orts, incorporating the 
use of alternative sustainable fuels is still not feasible in the region in which LA TAM operates. There is a disparity between the volume of fuel required by the industry and production volumes, which translates into prices that are far higher than those of 
regular fossil fuels. Moreover, the location of production plants and distributors could result 
in high transportation costs and a consequent increase in the company’s carbon footprint due to the long distances involved.Furthermore, governments have been occupied with other issues lately, leaving litt  le 
or no space for the discussion of sustainable fuels. This has led to regulations imposing the incorporation of biofuels that have ended up being impossible to apply. A case in point is Peru, where the government was forced to revoke this ruling, it being impossible to execute due to high prices and the lack of volumes necessary to supply the airline industry.
It is the company’s perception that the 
feasibility of sustainable alternative fuels depends on the adoption of a multi-sector approach that includes fuel producers, engine and aircraft   manufacturers, policy-makers, as 
well as the airlines. T ogether they may address this challenge and start developing guidelines and sources of funding to stimulate the incorporation of alternative sustainable fuels.The current conjuncture is not favorable for the use of this type of fuel in airline operations. The constant pursuit of new energy sources is a key issue for the sustainable development of the industry, and LA TAM will continue to work on developing alternatives which will enable the use of more sustainable fuels in the future.

T o meet the challenge of ensuring the 
alignment and high performance of 50,413 professionals, comprising 62 diﬀ  erent 
nationalities in 26 countries, LA TAM maintains a human resources management framework that comprehends talent att  raction and 
retention, training, performance management and succession management. The work done 
by this area supports the company’s ﬁve 
strategic pillars and its aspiration to be one of the three best airlines worldwide.
In 2015, a key focus was process simpliﬁcation 
and standardization of training for the entire group. Courses were adapted to incorporate modiﬁcations in procedures, in particular in the regulatory and safety areas. Based on a central design, these will be executed locally in the countries in which LA TAM and its aﬃ   liates 
have operations. For example, this process enabled the delivery of a single compliance 
training program for the entire LA TAM group, 
covering the main internal compliance policies 
and guidelines. 42,300 employees were 
trained, representing 84% of the work force.Also worthy of note was an initiative 
to consolidate the LA TAM culture, with the organization of a massive agenda of workshops. The ﬁrst wave was for leaders, with all the company’s 1,500 team leaders taking the courses. In a second stage, the training was extended to the teams, with the target of reaching all passenger-facing staﬀ   
by the end of 2016.
A total of over 2 million hours of technical, 
behavioral and leadership training was provided for employees in the diverse company areas, averaging 41.5 hours per person.

ENGAGEMENT FOR 
SUSTAINABILITY 
LA TAM invests in training its employees 
in the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainability. In parallel with the incorporation of these questions into business strategy, the company has been striving to raise employee consciousness and knowledge in sustainability-related issues.
Corporate health, safety and environment 
guidelines are set forth in the Code of Conduct which was approved in 2014. The company has 
developed speciﬁc training programs based 
on the document to disseminate its contents among the work force. Sustainability was also featured in the LA TAM culture workshop program taken by the entire work force.
Moreover, forums and workshops are being 
organized to brainstorm improvements in environmental development to encourage environmentally friendly choices among company personnel.
The airline group’s progress and challenges 
related to environmental performance are 
also addressed in a monthly newsletter sent to 
all employees.HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT 
In 2015, LA TAM implanted the use of 
tricycles to help employees move more quickly around the Maintenance Base in Santiago, Chile. These vehicles present a number of advantages compared with the electric motorcycles used previously: they do not generate any environmental impact, are equipped with cargo platforms 
for transporting heavier objects and help 
employees to stay ﬁt; they can also be maintained and repaired by suppliers already working on the Base. In a survey conducted among users, the tricycles were considered to be the safest and most convenient means of transport by 67% of the respondents.
Focused on emissions reduction, the company 
oﬀers its employees incentives to encourage environmentally responsible commuting. Some units provide vans for employee transportation, as well as preferential parking for participants in car sharing schemes.LEADERSHIP ROLE
In the eﬀort to consolidate and disseminate the organizational culture, of key importance are the team leaders, responsible for driving employee engagement in the day to day operations and ensuring their alignment with strategic objectives. The team leaders played an important role in preparing the development and culture workshops. A group of 40 leaders was responsible for training 
other leaders, who acted as multipliers, 
replicating the courses to their teams.SUPPORT FOR LEADERS
In line with the goals of simplifying processes and driving efﬁciency gains, LA TAM has been reﬁning the tools it provides to support leaders in managing their teams. In 2015, the company created a virtual library containing the main documents on people management policies and practices, which are updated and available for consultation and download. An internal contact center was also set up to clarify team leaders’ doubts. In the ﬁrst six 
months of activity, 98% of the leaders rated 
the service as “excellent” .
T o enable managers to be independent and 
proactive in managing their own careers, studies are underway to improve information channels. In the Chilean unit, a Personnel Attention Module is in place on the company intranet, providing each employee with information on their functional situation in the 
company. The idea is to reﬁne this model and 
extend it to the rest of the operation.

ECONOMIC STIMULUS ec8
Air transportation is a key driver for global development and the world economy, enabling more efﬁcient transportation of people and goods around the globe. The industry10 generates over 8.7 million 2 direct jobs and another 49.3 million indirect ones globally, as well as driving other sectors. The global economic impact is some US$ 2.4 trillion, representing 3.5% of global Gross Domestic 
Product. Around 35% of world trade – in value 
– involves air transportation. The share is even greater in the tourist industry, with 52% of holiday makers traveling by air.
According to the World Travel & T ourism 
Council (WTTC), the sector accounted for 284 million jobs in 2015, generating around US$ 7.8 trillion for the global economy, an increase of 3% compared with 2014.
As the leader in the region, LA TAM contributed 
towards leveraging the sector’s results. In 
2015, the company transported more than 4.8 
million passengers from diverse regions of 
the world to the main destinations in South America, with an impact estimated at US$ 4.7 billion. This total includes the average amount spent per tourist as informed by tourism organizations in the region11 , including airport CORPORA TE RESPONSABILITY :

In the Cuido mi Destino program, created in 
2009, LA TAM coordinates the work done by employee volunteers, students and authorities 
in repairing and refurbishing tourist spaces 
in determined cities, settlements or regions. 
The places selected are submitted to 
three interventions, which are defined in 
conjunction with the local community, over 
a three-year period. The goal is to promote the development of sustainable tourism. The program also has a direct positive impact on the economy and commerce in these areas.
In 2015, the group invested US$ 195,500 in 
these measures. Since 2009, spending has totaled US$ 1.6 million.In Chile, 40 young volunteers worked together 
on building a space in which artisans from the city of Neltume could produce their work and 
receive the hundreds of tourists that visit the 
town every year. US$ 29,300 was invested in the project, which took three months to execute. The intervention has helped empower the women involved and develop their small businesses, which now represent an important source of income for families in Neltume.In Puerto Natales, also in Chile, the access was remodeled and Community Participation Workshops were set up to boost tourism in the region. US$ 25,000 was invested in the city, one of the most important tourist destinations in the country. After the airport has been modernized, LAN should begin to operate a direct flight to the city from Santiago.
In Peru, the measures were aimed at valuing 
public spaces and organizing workshops to promote consciousness of the importance of the environment and tourism. Between 2010 and 2015, US$ 81,000 was invested in remodeling work on the Mirador de Acuchimay belvedere in Ayacucho and in Pantanos de Villa, an area in Lima that shelters more than 200 species of birds. The local was visited by 34,000 tourists in 2015. The work was carried out by 163 people, including LAN employees, students and teachers.

Large companies have complex structures 
characterized by numerous simultaneous processes with established goals and targets, Frequently, the pressures of the day to day tasks limit a team’s capacity to rethink the work it does and incorporate new approaches. T o avoid this, LA TAM created the Espacio LAB (Lab Space), which stimulates reflection on the dynamics of company routines and the pursuit of creative solutions that add value for the 
company and for its strategic stakeholders.
The Espacio Lab brings together employees 
from different company areas with the common goal of establishing a new meaning for the client experience based on the values and attributes associated with the LA TAM brand, such as innovation, its ties with Latin America and the delivery of a differentiated experience. The methodology employed 
encompasses the study of scenarios and 
trends and the integration of different 
viewpoints in a joint construction. External 
stakeholders – such as clients, opinion formers 
and specialists – and the different company 
areas – including crew members, catering and operations teams – were invited to participate.
One of the items the team focused on 
in 2015 was in-flight meals, which were analyzed employing a multifaceted approach, incorporating the cultural value of Latin American gastronomy and the care that 
goes into planning and preparing food for passengers. The wealth of Latin America, 
which encompasses landscapes as diverse 
as the Caribbean, Patagonia, the Argentinean Pampas, the Brazilian Northeast and the Amazon, the importance of the origin and identity of the food and the connection between gastronomy, cultural heritage and tourism were some of the aspects considered.
This study drove the refinement of the basic 
concept of in-flight meals and communication with the client. The plan for 2016 is to increment the menu with a product-focused cuisine. The company is considering including typical seasonal Latin American ingredients such as potatoes from Chiloé, cocoa from Peru, salmon from Patagonia. Apart from experiencing new flavors, passengers will learn some of the history of the region and curious details that make up its heritage.

Nowadays the potato is a fundamental culinary ingredient in diverse European countries, such as Russia, Poland and Spain, but cultivation of this tuber has its origins in the Americas. In the Andean region alone, more than 10,000 varieties have been identified, a veritable genetic treasure that inspires popular feasts and tourist events in Peru, Bolivia and Chile. The Chilean archipelago Chiloé, for example, has 286 native types that come in a variety of shapes and colors, ranging from red, white and blue to yellow, black, purple and pink. A number are described below:

The LA TAM 2015 Sustainability Report presents the 
most important information about the economic, social and ﬁnancial performance of the companies in the LA TAM Airlines Group during the period from January 1st to December 31st, 2015. The publication was prepared based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 guidelines, the main global reference for communicating sustainability. It fulﬁlls the requirements for the application of the Core option of the methodology, as attested in the independent veriﬁcation conducted by Deloitte.
The report content was determined based 
on the GRI methodology principles – balance, completeness, materiality and stakeholder inclusiveness – and reﬂects LA TAM’s management of the most relevant topics for its sustainability strategy. These topics are revised annually to guarantee alignment with the expectations and needs of the company’s stakeholders and to ensure closer focus in its action plans and communication strategies.
The following elements were taken into account 
in the materiality process underpinning the 2015 Sustainability Report: G4-18 and G4-26
˾ the results of a broad stakeholder consultation 
process carried out in December 2013, which involved individual interviews, meetings, panel discussions and online surveys that conveyed the opinions and perceptions of executives, employees, clients, suppliers, market analysts and specialists in the aviation sector;
˾  global reference documents on critical 
sector questions and impacts, such as the publications Sustainability topics for Sectors – What do Stakeholders Want to Know, from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Airlines Sustainability Accounting Standard guide from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB);
˾  internal LA TAM policies, including its 
Corporate Sustainability Strategy and the business’s strategic pillars;
˾  the company’s external commitments, such 
as the Carbon Neutral Growth 2020 initiative organized by the International Air Transport Association (IA TA).
In line with the recommendations in the GRI-G4 
guidelines, senior management analyzed the topics which could potentially impact LA TAM and its stakeholder groups, as well as the company’s capacity to inﬂuence each topic. At the end of the process, the interrelationships between the topics deﬁned as priorities were analyzed and strategies devised to group them together or separate them in order to ensure even greater clarity and accuracy in the processes of monitoring and communicating the results.
The end result of this process is the following

Each material topic has one or more indicators 
(see table) through which the company 
monitors its progress against goals and 
targets. All are directly or indirectly related 
to the macro objectives of the business 
and are backed by deﬁned strategies and 
people responsible for their execution. The 
company’s performance impacts the variable remuneration of leaders, who manage results via a matrix structure.
Safety performance, for example, and more 
specifically the non-occurrence of any accidents, is the trigger for the payment or not of a bonus each year. A second stage of the calculation takes into account performance against corporate targets, which directly affects the Executive Committee’s variable remuneration and impacts the variable component of remuneration for all employees. Worthy of note among the targets monitored are aspects related to the material 
themes in managing sustainability, such as customer satisfaction, linked with the topic of connectivity, and talent management and controlling staff turnover, which are part of 
the Organizational Health Index (OHI). The 
topic of economic-financial sustainability also comes into this stage of the calculation and is monitored via company income and cost efficiency indicators.
The third stage of the calculation takes into 
account specific topics and indicators for each area. Among the company’s top 19 executives, 15 have targets linked with customer satisfaction, 8 answer for safety-related topics, six have targets linked with the OHI and 5 have targets related to environmental performance.
Information on the management of the 
material topics and the results achieved is presented in the 2015 LA TAM Sustainability Report, the purpose of which is to hold the company accountable to its different stakeholder groups in relation to its commitment to integrating the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the business, striving for balance in the goals of driving economic growth, managing environmental impacts and generating social progress in the communities in which the organization operates.

four signiﬁcant ﬁnes for breaches of environmental standards, totaling US$ 18,000. Three of the ﬁnes were applied by the Brazilian environmental protection agency Ibama (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis ). These were for the transportation of ornamental ﬁsh caught without authorization, transportation of ﬁsh without proof of origin and for nonregistration with the federal agency overseeing the shipment of potentially hazardous goods.
