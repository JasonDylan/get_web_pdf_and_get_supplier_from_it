A Message from Our President and CEO
Geoff Ballotti  
President and Chief Executive Officer  
He/Him/HisWyndham Hotels & Resorts is committed to operating our business in a way that 
is socially, ethically and environmentally responsible  .
 As the world’s largest hotel 
franchising company, we have a unique opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the world while delivering on our mission to make hotel travel possible for all
 . 
No
w, more than ever, we must help ensure the future remains bright for travelers
 . 
T
he global pandemic has tested our team members and owners like never before, 
yet the toughest times also bring out the best in people  .
 Together, the Wyndham 
family continues to show resilience and unity in the face of unprecedented adversity
 .
As a ho
spitality company, service and volunteering are in our DNA
 .
 Our team 
members and franchisees have rallied during the pandemic to actively engage in their communities, generously giving time and resources to enhance the lives of others
 . 
T
he examples are numerous, ranging from the Wyndham Garden®  Dallas North 
in Texas, which offered 300 hotel rooms to first responders during the height of the pandemic; to the Microtel Inn & Suites®  by Wyndham Niagara Falls, N
 .Y .
, where 
the hotel owner and his family handcrafted more than 2,000 face masks for the community when they were desperately needed; and to New Zealand, where the Ramada Suites®  by Wyndham Queenstown Remarkables Park welcomed eight 
new babies when the nearest hospital had to relocate its maternity ward due to the pandemic
 .
Our o
wner-first mindset enabled the vast majority of our franchisees – who are 
primarily small business owners – to keep their hotels open when people were traveling less
 .
 We offered multiple fee waivers and extensions, access to hospital-
grade cleaning and safety products at reduced prices when these items were difficult to source, and relaxed housekeeping requirements that helped reduce water and energy use
 .
 Whether our hotels are welcoming leisure travelers looking 
for an escape to national parks and beaches, or hosting everyday business travelers such as utility workers and construction crews, our flexible booking policies and enhanced health and safety protocols continue to reassure travelers that they can Count on Us® to put safety first when they stay with us
 .W e are committed to operating sustainably in a way that provides outstanding 
experiences to those we serve  .
 We developed the Wyndham Green Program, a five-
level certification program that helps reduce a hotel’s environmental footprint
 .
 The 
program includes a proprietary environmental management tool that tracks data to help hotels improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions, conserve water, and reduce waste
 .
 Our work has been recognized through our participation in CDP’s climate 
change response, where we achieved the leadership band for our sustainability performance and disclosure
 . 
W
e strive to maintain a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion across our 
organization
 .
 We have increased senior leadership engagement in our Affinity 
Business Groups and continue to build on our robust Diversity, Equity and Inclusion training programs
 .
 We are proud to have received, for the third year in a row, 
a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign’s Equality Index, designating Wyndham as a best place to work, as well as having been named for two straight years to Ethisphere’s list of the world’s most ethical companies in 2019 and 2020
 . 
S
trong ethics are the foundation of our corporate culture, with integrity being one of 
the Company's core values
 .
 We recognize that companies with effective compliance 
programs not only make good ethical decisions, but outperform their peers
 .
W
e respect differences in people, ideas, and experiences, and we understand that 
we can only truly succeed by bringing together varying backgrounds and points of view
 .
 While we have been recognized for the progress we have made on our journey 
to date, we know we can – and will – continue to do more  .
W
yndham helps people realize the potential over every horizon
 .
 We believe in the 
power of travel – the ability to create lasting memories, to grow businesses, and to deepen our understanding of each other in a rapidly changing world
 .
 And as we 
emerge from this pandemic, we will continue to help build a future where all people feel welcomed and appreciated

Our COVID-19 Response
The start of a new decade brought with it an unprecedented global crisis, raising countless new questions and unforeseen complexities . Our responsibility as a company,

and elsewhere where required by local law  .

to support franchisees to welcome travelers back to their hotels, in alignment with our industry’s AHLA Stay 
Safe® initiative  .

procedures .

and healthcare workers – an instant complimentary Wyndham Rewards Gold membership upgrade and special rates through our Everyday Heroes 
program .

National First Responders Day, October 27th, 2020  .
For Our Franchisees
• In March 2020, we implemented a series of significant relief measures to help 
franchisees through the pandemic, including the deferral of all fees accruing 
for the months of March, April and May 2020 to September 1, 2020  .

2020, including Revenue Management Service, Loyalty Retraining, MOP

products at cost through our Count on Us® initiative  .

Wyndham Green Program
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts continues to support and promote the Wyndham Green Program which was designed to 
show how hotels can reduce operating costs through efficiency, help drive revenue from environmentally conscious 
travelers, remain competitive in the market and increase brand loyalty  . We are working to fully integrate the Wyndham 
Green Program throughout our value chain by engaging and educating executive and brand leaders, team members, 
design and construction partners, franchisees and our suppliers . The combination of industry best practices and stakeholder engagement aims to deliver triple bottom 
line results of people, planet and profits .  
The Wyndham Green Program consists of two integral components - the Wyndham Green Toolbox and Wyndham Green Certification . These components allow us to 
measure our impact, while aiming for continuous improvement across Wyndham properties .
Wyndham Green Toolbox 
The Wyndham Green Toolbox, a proprietary online environmental management system, is specifically 
designed to track, measure and report energy, emissions, water and waste diversion performance 
globally  . The Toolbox provides a visualization to analyze our franchisees' footprint at the macro 
and micro levels while scaling to our organization's goals . Data-driven insights allow us to identify 
risks and challenges in various markets to ensure we are striving towards our performance targets .  
Our branded properties have the ability to track and measure the impacts of efficiency measures 
that have been implemented, and we can monitor and benchmark their progress, allowing them to 
reduce operating costs and reducing our collective environmental impact .
Wyndham Green Certification Program 
The Wyndham Green Certification is our internal certification program, comprised of five progressive levels and five to seven best practices per level that address 
energy and water conservation, waste diversion, operational efficiency, as well as guest, team member and franchisee education and engagement . The Program 
aligns with popular external certification programs such as TripAdvisor Green Leaders® and Green Key®, which provide common sense initiatives that parallel building 
certification programs such as LEED® . The first 3 levels prioritize quick-payback efficiency measures, some of which are no-cost to low-cost .

to deliver long-term sustainable value  . We remain committed to increasing water 
conservation efforts and identifying risks and opportunities through our annual 
water risk assessment . In 2020, the impacts of COVID-19 significantly reduced water 
consumption for our organization .   
As part of our strategy, we launched a 2025 target to reduce water usage by 15% 
per square foot . We are also committed to evaluating opportunities at our managed 
hotels and recommend to install low flow fixtures and implement water conservative 
laundry programs and irrigation controls where appropriate  .
Through the Wyndham Green Certification Program, we also ask hotels to follow 
best practices on water conservation, including many low-to-no cost upgrades that 
reduce both consumption and operating costs . These items represent 25% of overall 
certification requirements .

Water Risk Assessment 
In 2020, Wyndham conducted a water risk assessment at all our managed and owned properties globally  . 
We assessed our exposure to water risks by mapping properties using the World Resources Institute (WRI) 
Aqueduct tool to identify locations with baseline water stress, riverline and coastal flood, drought and future 
water stress risks . FEMA’s Flood Maps were also used to identify U  .S . locations in 100-year flood zones .
Based on our assessment, approximately 35% of water used was in areas with high or extremely high baseline 
water stress . We will continue to utilize these results to prioritize the implementation of efficiency measures at 
properties with high water stress .  2021 ESG REPORT25 OF 72

In 2020, through our relationship with Clean the World, a non-profit organization that recycles used soap 
bars and amenity bottles in order to divert more waste from landfills while simultaneously improving the 
quality of lives in those communities lacking resources for water, sanitation, and hygiene, Wyndham Hotels 
& Resorts was able to divert over 9,500 pounds of soap and plastic from landfills and distribute over 
34,000 bars of soap  . Highlights

The Ramada ® by Wyndham Ajman, an independently owned and operated franchisee, is on a journey to 
reduce their waste and launched the Zero Landfill Project . In 2020, they achieved an estimated 90% waste 
diversion through a comprehensive recycling program that aligns with the Wyndham Green Certification, 
a dedicated zero landfill room to separate recyclables and the installation of a dewaterer and waste 
macerator machine, which grinds food waste into fine particles and through centrifugal action, forces out 
the excess liquid for grey water use and organic material for composting .
Next Steps
In 2021, we aim to improve our waste data capture and increase waste diversion rates . Waste diversion practices are currently embedded within the Wyndham Green 
Certification Program, with 25% of the certification items directly impacting waste diversion related efforts . We will continue to use this program to accelerate our 
waste goals and increase waste diversion globally  .

Human Rights
Protecting Human Rights
Wyndham’s core values highlight our commitment to help support ethical business practices and good corporate citizenship, 
including our commitments to help combat slavery and human trafficking . We aim to operate our business in a manner 
consistent with the principles contained in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Global Compact .  
We also continue to help develop resources to educate our team members and stakeholders across relevant areas of our 
business and supply chain .
As part of our commitment, we enhanced our policies and mandated training of all our team members and independently 
owned and operated franchisees to help identify and report trafficking activities . We also continue to work alongside other 
leaders in our industry, to supporting our industry’s efforts to try to end human trafficking .  
Risk Assessments
We have developed a risk-based approach to report, manage and roll out programs intended to help protect human rights in 
areas where we believe there is a high risk of such activity and where we have operational control over the business and our 
supply chain .
Additionally, clear accountability mechanisms are in place to monitor and report on compliance with our Business Principles 
and Human Rights Policy  . In addition, parties contracting with the Company, such as franchisees and vendors, are also 
required to operate in a manner which is compliance with all applicable laws and subject to certain operating standards . Our 
leadership team is responsible for providing oversight of the enforcement of Human Rights, which includes but is not limited 
to the continual improvement of risk monitoring and assessment procedures . We also seek to incorporate feedback from 
stakeholders as we advance our engagement activities to respect and protect human rights within our sphere of influence; 
and we are committed to publicly reporting our progress to our stakeholders .
The 5-Star Promise
Since 2018, we have partnered with American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) to support the 5-Star Promise – a pledge 
to provide tools and resources to enhance safety and security for hotel employees in hotels across the US . Through the 
initiative, we strengthened policies and provided new trainings and resources, including employee safety devices (ESDs), to 
further hotel safety, including prevention and response to sexual harassment and assault . Wyndham Hotels & Resorts is proud 
to unite with our industry in support of the 5-Star Promise, showing a shared commitment to the incredible people who help 
make our guests’ travels memorable  . We are dedicated to our team members’ safety and security  .

Human Trafficking Awareness Training 
Hotels are one of many venues that traffickers use to exploit their victims . As a result, we provide access to 
online training programs, available through partnerships with BEST (Businesses Ending Slavery and Trafficking),   
ECPAT-USA, Polaris and Sustainable Hospiality Alliance, to expand education about human trafficking, 
awareness and reporting .  
Wyndham recorded over 34,000 training impressions viewed by our corporate and managed team members 
and independently owned and operated franchisees in 2020 (a 19% increase YOY) including classes titled: 
• Anti-Sexual Harassment
• Safety & Security
• Human Trafficking Awareness
• Diversity & Anti-Discrimination
As part of our ongoing Business Continuity Plan Emergency Preparedness Guide and Training, we also include 
checklists, escalation protocols and information to assist our property management and various staff in 
identifying the key warning signs of human trafficking and guidance on how to report cases . Wyndham has 
mandated human trafficking awareness training for all hotels and corporate team members .
Supply Chain Responsibility
As a global hospitality company, we and our franchised properties purchase services and products all over the 
world . Our supply chain covers procurement at corporate and local levels, and we expect our suppliers to act in 
a compliant and ethical manner  . As such, we ask them to meet our Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”), 
which sets forth our expectations concerning forced labor and child hiring practices .  
Our approved supplier program supports purchasing for our stakeholders by negotiating prices and volume 
discounts with third-party suppliers . We take a risk-based approach to our approved supplier due diligence, 
including reviewing suppliers doing business in high-risk countries or offering high-risk products or services .  
Should a supplier not meet our requirements or ethical standards, we will not approve that supplier  . For previously 
approved suppliers, we require corrective action or termination if needed . We utilize a risk-based approach to 
report, manage and roll out programs intended to combat slavery and human trafficking in areas where we believe 
there is a high risk of such activity and where we have operational control over the business and supply chain .
Remediation Actions
As permitted by law, we encourage our team members and franchisees to report certain matters confidentially or anonymously through a third party whistleblower hotline  . 
In addition, for our North America operations, we make available a third party hotline, operated by Polaris, whereby team members of our owned and managed properties 
can consult with experts who will help them identify suspected signs of slavery and human trafficking and report such matters to the authorities . Moreover, globally, we 
distribute information at our owned and managed properties (and encourage the use of these materials by our franchised hotels) which assists team members with 
identifying potential signs of slavery and human trafficking and provides a process for timely escalating concerns within the organization .

and mitigation and report to the full Board or the relevant Committee regarding risk management .  
Corporate Security, Safety & Business Continuity
To protect the safety and security of our guests, Wyndham provides on-going training to our operational teams to ensure guest safety during emergency events and 
situations . This includes preparation and response measures to protect guest safety and manage operations during extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and 
wildfires, as well as other urgent circumstances that require immediate response, such as terroristist attacks, civil unrest, and global pandemics . To manage property risks, 
our Corporate Security, Safety, & Business Continuity team engages with all of our corporate facilities to develop risk profiles . Based on the risk assessment, a recovery time 
objective (RTO) is determined and appropriate business recovery solutions are designed for the location to meet objectives . When any event occurs Wyndham, senior 
leaders and property managers for that location are alerted, allowing us to proactively take measures to minimize the adverse impact of the event .  
Our management approach is to try to ensure the workplace safety is rigorous and both data and process driven for our team members . Wyndham utilizes an Occupational 
Health and Safety Management System to establish and maintain an effective process for implementing safety standards and procedures across our business . To ensure we 
maintain the highest level of safety awareness, health and safety reviews are conducted which evaluate the performance of individually owned and operated hotels within 
the areas of regulatory compliance, associate training, emergency preparedness, fire, and life safety  . In alignment with our goal to maintain a consistently high standard of 
safety performance, we also use an online incident reporting and loss prevention system which enables stakeholders to identify and track work-related risks and hazards .
All owned and managed hotels are also provided with a Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Emergency Preparedness Guide to assist them to prepare for and manage an 
emergency  . The Emergency Preparedness Guide establishes minimum requirements and provides a responsible managerial plan detailing the protection of life at each of 
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts properties . Management at all levels provides the means for prompt corrective action in an effort to eliminate unsafe acts, unsafe conditions, 
damage, and abuse of equipment, machinery, materials and supplies .
In order to facilitate notifications to key corporate stakeholders as well as to provide external support to the property when needed, Wyndham also established the 
Emergency Reporting Service (ERS) . The Emergency Reporting Service is a dedicated 24/7 toll free number for property managers to report critical incidents and 
immediately receive guidance and support in managing the event and minimizing the impact of the event on our managed properties .2021 ESG REPORT48 OF 72

Ethics & Compliance 
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts considers its ethical culture as integral to all we do to make hotel travel possible for all .   
Our Approach 
As a global company, we strive to grow our business responsibly, enhance the communities in which we operate 
and avoid practices that could be harmful to others . In accordance with our Business Principles, all team members 
are expected to do their part to maintain the highest ethical standards and behavior as we continue to grow in 
communities around the world . As corrupt practices have devastating impacts globally, we are committed to 
conducting our business fairly and in compliance with all applicable anti-corruption legislation, including the US 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act . Our commitment to ethical business practices is reflected in our 
Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud Policy; Gifts, Travel & Entertainment and Contributions Standard; Conflict of Interest 
Standard and Political Activity Standard .
Hotline Reporting System
Strong ethics are the foundation for our culture at Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, with Integrity and Accountability as 
two of our core values . As part of our commitment to these values, we offer our Integrity hotline, available 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week and 365 days per year for confidential and anonymous reporting of concerns . We do not tolerate 
retaliation in any form against team members for reporting potential ethical violations in good faith or for participating 
in an investigation .
The Integrity hotline system is administered by a leading third party provider, NAVEX Global . It includes phone and 
web-reporting capabilities (U  .S .), and allows us to utilize issue identification, prioritization, assignment and escalation 
functionality to promptly raise and investigate reported concerns . The most critical category matters are identified 
as a “Matter Requiring Reporting” (MRR) . MRRs require investigation and resolution in an escalated timeframe, with 
oversight from senior leadership including the General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer  . MRRs are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis with our external auditors, and selected representative MRRs are discussed quarterly with the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors . The Audit Committee is also briefed quarterly by the General Counsel and Chief 
Compliance Officer concerning core hotline statistics such as overall case volume, topic or root cause trends .
When cases are closed, our case management teams conduct a root cause analysis and consider enhancements in 
operations or processes to prevent recurrence of similar scenarios . Our human resources teams are included as part 
of our core case management teams, not only to support investigations and any related necessary employment or 
disciplinary actions, but also to monitor related operations to ensure retaliation does not occur  .
Highlight
World’s Most Ethical 
Companies 
In both 2019 and 2020 Wyndham 
was recognized as one of the 
World’s Most Ethical companies by 
the Ethisphere Institute, a leader in 
measuring corporate ethical standards 
and advancing and promoting best 
ethical business practices . In 2020, 
we were one of only two lodging and 
hospitality organizations globally to 
receive this recognition . Wyndham 
is actively involved with Ethisphere's 
Business Ethics Leadership Alliance, 
which consists of almost 300 leading 
member companies . .

Our Integrity hotline is supported internally with awareness 
campaigns to promote usage  . Our campaigns use the tagline 
message of “Speak Up! Help us live our Company’s core values of 
Integrity and Accountability by reporting your ethical concerns” to 
encourage reporting, and reminding team members that compliance 
and ethics are everyone’s responsibility  . Campaign materials 
include flyers and posters for location displays, as well as desk 
drop supplementary materials, such as cards and stickers . Reader-
friendly infographic 5x7 cards provide transparency into the Integrity 
reporting, investigation and resolution processes as well as dispelled 
frequent “hotline myths”, while stickers for mobile phones with 
Integrity hotline contact information facilitate team member reporting 
anytime or anywhere from their mobile devices .
Global Anti-Corruption Training 
Wyndham provides training in support of its anti-corruption efforts, as well as its ethics and compliance and related programs in a variety of formats customized to 
various stakeholders and business needs . Core training courses were streamlined and relaunched to include instructor-led, online and tablet or mobile compatible 
formats .  
Our Global Anti-Corruption Training content was updated to educate team members not only on how to comply with our policies and procedures, but to facilitate their 
understanding of the devastating effects of corruption on global communities . Fighting corruption is not only a compliance matter, but as it disproportionately affects 
the poor and most vulnerable, increasing their costs and reducing access to critical health, education and other services, it is an ethical concern where we encourage our 
team members to think globally and act locally  .

Data Privacy & Cybersecurity
Privacy and Information Security
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts recognizes that our guests, Wyndham Rewards members, team members, hotel owners, suppliers and others place their trust in us when 
they provide us with their personal information, and that managing privacy and information security effectively is an integral part of fulfilling our mission of making hotel 
travel possible for all . We demonstrate our commitment to our ethical culture, our core values of Integrity and Accountability and that we are deserving of this trust when 
our privacy and information security practices align with our Count on Me team member philosophy  . We believe that to truly deliver a great experience and build industry 
relationships and customer loyalty, we must respect individuals’ choices concerning their personal data, work to ensure it is appropriately protected and be responsive to 
their information-related requests or concerns .
Governance
Our privacy and information security programs focus holistically on the information lifecycle, and work in close partnership with our information management program .  
The three programs are all under the oversight of the Information Risk Committee (IRC) . The IRC is chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer and the SVP- Legal, 
with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer and General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer as members . The IRC meets regularly to review operations 
of the three programs, as well as emerging legal, technical or other risks . The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is the Board-level committee with oversight for 
privacy and security matters . IRC members update the Audit Committee quarterly to provide company risk updates and general education on privacy and information

Key Program Activities
Our privacy and information security teams collaborate on a number of processes designed to support key 
information privacy and security principles, corresponding global laws and regulations reflecting these principles, 
and the concerns of our stakeholders .  
• Risk Assessments: Our teams conduct vendor risk assessments of third party suppliers that 
may receive access to personal data or connectivity to our systems, for which such vendor risk 
assessments include information security control assessments and privacy impact assessments, 
regardless of the sensitivity of personal data potentially involved . We conduct similar internal 
assessments should any process potentially result in a significant change to our data processing 
practices concerning sensitive data, or having a potentially material impact to individuals’ data and 
respective rights .
• Privacy By Design: Our privacy and information security teams collaborate with our operations teams 
to review new initiatives, processes and engagements to ensure privacy and security is considered 
and incorporated into planning from project inception . Reviews focus not only on respecting rights 
and appropriately safeguarding personal data processed, but ensuring that concepts such as data 
minimization (processing the minimal amount of personal data needed to fulfill the project’s objective) 
are applied throughout project lifecycles .
• Data Subject Requests: Our privacy, information security, information technology and program teams 
collaborate to respond to individuals’ data related requests (such as for access, rectification, deletion 
or restrictions on processing) . This applies whether requests are submitted by individuals from jurisdictions with certain legal requirements, such as 
those imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) or submitted from others 
in jurisdictions where no such requirements exist . 
• Threat Monitoring: Our information security teams regularly conduct threat intelligence activities, penetration testing and monitoring for emerging risks, 
as well as proactively share with and learn from other entities in the industry to better enable collective detection and response capabilities against 
emerging security threats targeting the hospitality sector  . We also utilize external auditors annually to review segments of our security practices .
• Training & Awareness: All team members are trained on privacy and security risks, with training ranging from principles and risks discussed in our 
core Business Principles course, and certain team member roles receiving additional assigned courses, as well as ad hoc specific trainings for certain 
products, departments, data types or in response to upcoming legislative or regulatory changes . We also conduct proactive quarterly phishing 
awareness training exercises for all computer-based team members .
• Notifications: We comply with global notification requirements should we experience an applicable information security incident . Additionally, we utilize 
analytics to assist us in detecting potentially unauthorized attempts to access personal data of our guests or members, and may make discretionary 
notifications to individuals of such attempts as appropriate, so that they may consider taking additional precautions to help protect their data .
Transparency 
Our information practices, including individuals’ rights and mechanisms by which they may submit requests for consideration are further described in our Privacy Notice  . 
Our Privacy Notice may be updated with certain changes taking effect as of the posting of the notice either for data collected after that point or to make technical, 
formatting or non-material changes or clarifications concerning data already collected and processed . Should we consider making changes to materially change data 
processing for data we already hold, we would provide prior notice of these changes and obtain consent for such changed processing .

information is material .  
Climate-related risks and opportunities identified over short-term, medium-term and long-term horizon
Wyndham continuously monitors and prioritizes climate-related risks and opportunities based on the financial and strategic impacts on our business .  
Time Horizons 
We have identified climate-related risks with potential impact to our business over short-term (1 – 2 years), medium-term (3 – 6 years) and long-term  
(7 – 10 years) time horizons .
Climate-Related Risks 
Risk Type Risk Classification Risk Description Time Horizon
Transition Reputation Increased stakeholder concern or negative stakeholder feedback: Our 
stakeholders (notably our guests, investors and team members) are increasingly 
interested in our approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities . 
Additionally, due to our Company’s scale within the hotel industry, we may be 
subject to increased scrutiny  .1 – 2 years
Physical Acute Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones 
and floods: Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, 
such as hurricanes and wildfires, could impact travel demand in specific markets, 
lead to supply chain interruptions and may cause damage to our physical assets .1 – 2 years
Physical Chronic  Rising sea levels: Many of our Wyndham-branded hotels are located in coastal 
areas that could be threatened should sea levels dramatically rise  . Due to this risk, 
these properties may experience decreased revenue and/or property damage 
that could impact the revenue and cash flow generated from these assets .7 – 10 years
Risk Type Risk Description Time Horizon
Resource 
Efficiency Move to more efficient buildings: Increasing the energy efficiency of our Wyndham-branded hotels can 
help to increase our management revenues and franchise revenues in addition to supporting global efforts 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .1 – 2 years
Products & 
Services Shifts in Consumer Preferences: Our guests are increasingly interested in practices that promote 
sustainable tourism across each touchpoint during their experience within our portfolio of Wyndham-
branded hotels . Industry research has also indicated a correlation between sustainability and customer 
satisfaction within the hotel industry, which can create an opportunity for our Company  .3 – 6 years
Resilience Participation in renewable energy programs and adoption of energy-efficiency measures: The 
development and enactment of renewable energy regulations at the national, state and local levels 
may create new investment opportunities for our Company  . Additionally our managed hotels have the 
opportunity to capitalize on rebates from utilities and governments in support of our energy efficiency 
measures .3 – 6 yearsClimate-Related Opportunities 2021 ESG REPORT68 OF 72

Impact on businesses, strategy and financial planning
Potential risks associated with products and services, our supply chain and operations have been integrated into our business strategy and planning process through our 
(1) commitment to achieving emissions reductions to support a low-carbon, science-based pathway; (2) launch of the Wyndham Green Certification Program and Social 
Responsibility Council; and (3) execution of our Business Continuity programs and associated emergency response plans .
The most significant risk identified as having a potential impact to our revenues is related to reputation, as guests, corporate customers, governmental customers and 
meeting planners are increasingly interested in climate change and broader sustainability issues . The management of these risks presents a potential opportunity to 
increase revenue through competitive differentiation . To mitigate this risks, we will continue to advance our programs to engage with franchisees to promote sustainability  .
Impact of different scenarios, including a 2⁰C scenario
Wyndham’s current 2025 emissions target has been designed to limit a global temperature rise by 2 degrees Celsius . Our target is based on a linear pathway, where we 
plan to focus on energy intensity and efficiency specifications through our 2025 target, and from 2025-2050 to explore increasing renewable energy for generation of 
electricity both onsite and offsite, as outlined by the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) and its methodology for power generation .
The scenario analysis that has directly influenced our business objectives and strategy is that we align our emissions reduction strategies and investments in energy 
efficiency and renewable energy use to support our multi-decade journey to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with what is required to limit the rise in 
global temperatures in alignment with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendations .
Additional information on Wyndham’s climate-related risks and opportunities can be found in the Wyndham Green Program (pages 18-20), Energy & Emissions (pages 
21-22)  and Risk Management (page 47) sections of this Report and Wyndham’s 2020 CDP Climate Change response (pages 3-11, C2.1-C2.4, C3.1b and C3.1d-C3.1f).
