COMMUNITY RELATIONS 
ANNUAL REPORT 
Dear readers, 
It is my pleasure to introduce 
Adtalem’s fiscal year 2018 
Sustainability and Community 
Report. As many of you know, 
Adtalem Global Education 
has a mission-driven focus, 
demonstrated in what we 
teach and how we teach, and 
importantly, demonstrated by our 
tens of thousands of alumni and 
members across the globe making 
inspiring contributions to their 
communities.
Adtalem’s commitments extend 
beyond the community and 
classroom, and are also reflected in 
the way we govern our business to 
ensure quality operations.
Therefore, this year’s report 
has been expanded to include 
an explanation of Adtalem’s 
sustainability strategy, and to share 
examples of our environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) 
policies and practices. See our 
sustainability strategy statement 
and further ESG details on pages 3 
through 5.
2018 was also a transformative year 
for Adtalem Global Education’s 
community platform, as we took a 
more expansive view to ensure our 
community investments reflected 
Adtalem’s global presence, and 
strategic growth in the medical 
and healthcare, and professional 
education segments.
Also, the move of our corporate 
headquarters to downtown 
Chicago was reflected in a 
renewed focus on supporting the 
public education system in the city. 
Fiscal 2018 saw an increase in the 
need for disaster relief support A Message 
on Adtalem’s 
Sustainability 
and 
Community 
Programsas well. Twenty U.S. states and 
our Caribbean communities were 
impacted by hurricanes, flooding 
and other natural disasters. We 
therefore provided additional 
corporate contributions to disaster 
relief in an effort to advance 
rebuilding endeavors in these 
resilient communities. Learn about 
the Foundation and our global 
giving on pages 6 and 7.
The spirit of giving is best reflected 
by our colleagues, faculty and 
students, who volunteered their 
time, talent and resources to many 
worthwhile organizations over the 
past year.
Adtalem launched its inaugural 
“Month of Service” initiative, 
thus deepening our support for 
colleagues’ personal community 
engagement. An extensive amount 
of volunteering was completed at 
the campus level as well, benefiting 
people and projects in the places 
where we teach. See pages 8 
and 9 for examples of our global 
volunteering efforts.
Throughout this report, we 
have included reflections 
from our community partners. 
These “partner profiles” are a 
representation of the strong 
relationships we have built with 
community organizations across 
the globe. We are grateful to our 
partners and value their incredible 
contributions to society.
Adtalem is proud to be a mission-
driven organization dedicated to 
being an agent of change globally, 
while understanding that true 
impact is made locally, person-to-
person, one community at a time.
Creating a dynamic global 
community of life-long 
learners who improve  
the world. VISIONWe believe in providing  
global access to knowledge 
that transforms lives and 
enables careers. MISSIONABOUT ADTALEMSVP, Corporate Relations,

Adtalem in our efforts to inspire and prepare young people to succeed 
in a global economy. The generous financial support from the Adtalem 
Global Education Foundation has enabled JA to provide programing 
to more than 2,800 students in the Chicago market this year. While 
many of these programs foster entrepreneurial thinking and sound 
money management, Adtalem has played an invaluable role in helping 
our students prepare for careers in STEM-related fields through our JA 
Reverse Job Shadow program.  We are grateful for the volunteers from 
Adtalem for providing their time, talent and inspiration to our young 
people.”  
Derek Ernst, Vice President of Operations,  
Junior Achievement of Chicago
NEW LEADERS, INC.
“Because of the grant New Leaders received from the Adtalem Global 
Education Foundation, three Emerging Leaders participants were able 
to complete the program at no cost. As a result of participating in the 
program, these teacher leaders were able to build their instructional 
leadership capacity and have an impact on the instructional practice of 
peers, which ultimately led to better outcomes for students.”
Lakita McKinney, Executive Director,  
Program Implementation, New Leaders, Inc.

GOLDEN APPLE
“The Golden Apple Foundation is incredibly grateful for Adtalem’s grant 
in support of our Golden Apple Scholars Program. Our Golden Apple 
Scholars are diverse, largely first-generation college goers, with high 
potential, grit and perseverance, who are recruited from the communities 
in which we return them to serve as teachers in schools-of-need. We are 
beyond grateful for this investment in ensuring students have the benefit 
of highly-effective teachers, as teachers are the most important factor in 
a student’s academic growth and, thus, one of the best investments you 
can make in the future of a child.”
Alicia Winckler, President and Chief Executive Officer, Golden Apple

PLAYER DEVELOPMENT SXM
“When Hurricane Irma forced medical students to leave the island, they 
never stopped helping us. Many have become pen pals and send our at-
risk children letters on a weekly basis. The children have seen photos of 
familiar faces in England (from nearly all the Harry Potter locations) and 
photos from AUC folks at home or at hospitals from Michigan, Arizona, 
Georgia and even Canada. We have even used the internet to video chat 
with some of the students. We look forward to their return and to playing 
a game of baseball very soon.”
Tom Burnett, Coach – Little League, Player Development SXM
ONEGOAL CHICAGO
“OneGoal is committed to making college graduation a viable, attainable 
option for all students, because every young person deserves the 
opportunity to earn a college degree–and the life that comes with it. The 
Adtalem Global Education Foundation’s generous investment helped us 
reach more than 6,000 students in Chicago. OneGoal has an opportunity 
to close the gap between the Chicago and the nationwide attainment 
rates in a matter of years. We cannot do this alone. Our success depends 
on champions who understand the stakes, share our belief in all students, 
and are committed to solving the degree divide in our lifetime. In 
partnership with the Adtalem Global Education Foundation, we will 
continue to change the face of higher education–and the workforce–
across Chicago.”
Tracy Woodley, Manager of Development,  
Foundation and Public Funding, OneGoal Chicago
WINGS PROGRAM, INC.
“WINGS is extremely grateful to the Adtalem Global Education 
Foundation for the generous grant to support our Safe House at WINGS 
Metro, located on the southwest side of Chicago. Domestic violence is a 
serious public health problem. Those who experience it are at a higher 
risk of mental health disorders, chronic diseases and infections. The Safe 
House at WINGS Metro is a safe haven where adults and children can 
escape domestic violence. With this grant, the Adtalem Counseling Office 
will be named to provide the space for healing to take place. On behalf of 
all of the women, men and children who desperately need this treatment, 
thank you to Adtalem!”
Rebecca Darr, Chief Executive Officer, WINGS Program, Inc.
