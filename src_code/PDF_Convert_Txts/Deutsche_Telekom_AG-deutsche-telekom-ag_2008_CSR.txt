KNr. 642 200 148 (English)This Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect 
the current views of Deutsche T elekom management with 
respect to future events. They are generally identified by the 
words “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” “aim,” “goal,” “plan,” “will,” “seek,” “outlook” or similar expres-
sions and include generally any information that relates to 
expectations or targets for revenue, adjusted EBITDA or other 
performance measures. Forward-looking statements are 
based on current plans, estimates, and projections, and 
should therefore be considered with caution. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are diffi-
cult to predict and are generally beyond Deutsche T elekom’s 
control, including those described in the sections “Forward-
Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” of the Company’s 
Form 20-F report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission. Among the relevant factors are the progress 
of Deutsche T elekom’s workforce reduction initiative and the impact of other significant strategic or business initiatives, including acquisitions, dispositions and business combinations. In addition, regulatory rulings, stronger than expected com-
petition, technological change, litigation and regulatory devel-
opments, among other factors, may have a material adverse effect on costs and revenue development. If these or other risks 
and uncertainties materialize, or if the assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, Deutsche T elekom’s actual results may be materially different from those expressed 
or implied by such statements. Deutsche T elekom can offer 
no assurance that its expectations or targets will be achieved. 
Without prejudice to existing obligations under capital market law, Deutsche T elekom does not assume any obligation to 
update forward-looking statements to take new information 
or future events into account or otherwise.

Digital divide.  The term digital divide refers to a situation in which 
people do not have the same degree of access to modern digital 
information and communication technologies (ICT) and, for this reason, do not have the same opportunities for social and economic development. As a leading ICT enterprise, Deutsche T elekom sees itself responsible for giving people within its sphere of influence broad access to ICT and, in this way, for preventing inequality.
EMF – Electromagnetic fields.  Electromagnetic fields are a combina-
tion of electric and magnetic fields. They are produced when electric 
current and charges change. This forms an electromagnetic wave, which transfers energy. Some EMFs occur in nature – daylight, for example – while others are generated by technical apparatus.
E-TASC – Electronics-Tool for Accountable Supply Chain. The 
electronics industry’s information tool – E-TASC – is an innovative instrument that helps us to establish transparency with regard to the social and ecological aspects of our supply chain.
GeSI – Global e-Sustainability Initiative.  GeSI is a joint initiative 
established by the world’s leading ICT organizations with the objective 
of improving sustainability in the ICT sector. Deutsche T elekom is a member of GeSI, as are many other leading enterprises.
Global Compact. Global Compact, the initiative founded in 2000 
by the then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a “global pact,” aims to support and strengthen cooperation between the United Nations, industry and other social gr oups. It sets out ten principles 
relating to the protection of human rights, employment, social and environmental standards, and the fight against corruption, and calls on companies to incorporate these into their corporate policies. Deutsche T elekom originally declared its commitment to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the year 2000.
ICT. Information and Communication T echnology.ISO 14001. The international environmental management standard 
ISO 14001 defines requirements that are accepted worldwide for environmental management systems. They focus on a continual improvement  process in the implementation of green goals in busi-ness enterprises and other institutions. These can have their environ-mental management systems certified to the ISO 14001 standard by independent environmental auditors.
KPI – Key Performance Indicator.  In business administration, 
key per formance indicators are figures that are used to measure the 
progress that an organization has made in the implementation of its main objectives.Low-carbon society. The term “low-carbon society” refers to a scenario for future development of the world economy in which greenhouse gas emissions, above all CO
2 emissions, are greatly reduced in order 
to slow down the ongoing climate change. Increased efficiency based on the use of innovative information and communication technologies can play a vital role in this field.
RECS – Renewable Energy Certificates System. RECS was intro-
duced in 2002 in order to promote the development of renewable energies at international level. The system now operates in 24 coun-tries in Europe as well as in Canada, the USA and South Africa. The standard certificate awarded by RECS guarantees that identifiable amounts of electrical energy are  supplied from specific regenerative sources, thus making regenerative, CO
2-neutral energy freely tradable. 
Procurement of these certificates when buying energy means that the quantities purchased can be allocated to the certificate acquirer. Deutsche T elekom relies on this system to obtain all the energy it needs in Germany from regenerative sources.
SAR – Specific Absorption Rate. The SAR is measured in watts per 
kilogram of body weight. It is a measure of the rate at which electro-magnetic energy is absorbed and converted to body heat. The SAR levels of all mobile phones sold by T-Mobile comply with the limits set out in international guidelines, and generally fall well below them.
Social Audit. In order to embrace the Deutsche T elekom values 
throughout our procurement processes, we hold special assessment procedures, known as Social Audits, on a regular basis. The key components of these Social Audits are:– Risk assessment– Supplier self-assessment– Internal supplier assessment–  Personal contact and constructive dialog with suppliers and 
business partners
– Audit report including audit evaluation.
SPWG – Sustainable Procurement Working Group.  T o ensure 
a sustainable, universal procurement strategy is implemented, 
Deutsche T elekom sets up a cross-Group body in 2007: the Sustain-able Procurement Working Group (SPWG). The Working Group is the central point of contact for all issues and problems relating to sustainable procurement. The SPWG’s  primary aims include clearly mapping out a suitable procurement profile, devising exacting social and environmental standards as well as monitoring the procurement process in accordance with these standards.
T-Laboratories. The T-Laboratories are a research and development 
institute that Deutsche T elekom opened in Berlin in 2005. The institute is an associate of T echnische Universität Berlin and gives top scientists from all over the world the chance to work in an attractive research environment. The institute’s work focuses on the development of innovative services and solutions for Deutsche T elekom customers.About this report.
More than ten years ago, Deutsche T elekom began reporting about its 
commitment in social activities. Initially, environment issues had been our 
main concern. With the growing interest of the public and our stakeholders 
on the subject of sustainability, the scope of our reporting too has been extended. Since 2003, Deutsche T elekom has published its annual com-
bined report on human resources and sustainability. The interim report 
“Corporate Responsibility (CR) Facts & Figures” from 2007 serves as the 
transition to the present form of reporting. With “Connected life and work. 
Bringing people together. Embracing responsibility. Finding solutions.” 
we are pleased to present our first, in-depth CR report. Aim of the report is to give a detailed account to our stakeholders and the general public about 
the activities, progress and goals of our company in business, social and environmental issues. The report also serves as an 
update of Deutsche T elekom’s progress in the scope of the 
United Nations Global Compact.
Our present report is modeled in compliance with the interna-tionally recognized guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) G3 including the T elecommunications Sector Supple-ment (pilot version 1.0). By awarding the highest Application 
Level of “A+,” the GRI has acknowledged Deutsche T elekom’s exacting 
adherence to the initiative’s requirements of open and transparent report-
ing. While selecting the topics portrayed within the present report, we have 
also considered, apart from the recommendations issued by the GRI, the results of a materiality workshop conducted in December 2007. T aking into 
account the perspective of external stakeholders, the key fields of respon-
sibility for Deutsche T elekom, the most material issues, were identified. 
These issues were subsequently assigned to corresponding CR areas of 
action, viz. customers, ecology, suppliers, human resources and social commitment, each of which forms one chapter of the present report. As 
part of these chapters, spotlights focus on particularly challenging issues 
in the telecommunications sector, as seen from the perspective of impor-
tant stakeholders, as well as Deutsche T elekom’s responses to these 
 topics. Subjects not discussed in the printed CR report are dealt with in the online report. The 
 symbol and a numeral indicate where additional 
information is available online. By entering these numerals in the search field of the CR Online Report, the reader is led directly to the Internet 
page containing the desired information. In addition, our Group portal, www.telekom.com/corporate-responsibility, presents constantly updated 
reports on our CR activities.
The key indicators section at the end of the report presents an overview of 
selected consolidated key indicators of Deutsche T elekom. Some of these 
key indicators have been examined by independent auditors for accuracy, completeness and adequacy. The result is presented in the certification on page 70. 
The report is a Group report and incorporates all Group subsidiaries in 
which Deutsche T elekom holds a majority interest. The reporting period 
applies to the financial year 2007. However, we have also included 
relevant information from 2008 available to us by the editorial deadline on February 29, 2008. We may also report beyond the editorial deadline in exceptional cases to reflect the latest developments. The data protection spotlight, for example, was updated in October 2008. “Connected life 
and work. Bringing people together. Embracing responsibility. Finding 
solutions.” is available in both the English and German language versions. 
Our next CR report is due to be published in summer 2009.

GRI index and 
Global Compact Communication on Progress.
Deutsche T elekom’s 2008 Corporate Responsibility (CR) Report fully meets 
the current guidelines (G3) from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), 
including the pilot version of the T elecommunications Sector Supplement 
of 2003. GRI has checked and confirmed this with an “A+,” the highest application level. 
The following GRI index indicates to what extent we take the GRI indicators 
into account. At the same time, it shows where in the report the indicators 
are dealt with. For some indicators, we also refer to the 2008 CR Online 
Report and other publications of the Deutsche T elekom Group. Additional indicators, whose fulfillment is not compulsory for level A, are printed in gray.
A detailed GRI index is published in the 2008 CR Online Report. There 
you can find additional information for the individual indicators, and an 
explanation why Deutsche T elekom does not make reference to certain 
indicators. In some cases, this is due to the materiality process, which 
preceded the report process.  
  See page 17.
COP. This CR Report also serves as a COP (Communication on Progress) 
report f or Deutsc
he T elekom in line with the United Nations Global Compact. 
The following table shows where in this CR Report or in the 2008 CR Online Report Deutsche T elekom’s fulfillment of the ten Global Compact principles 
is dealt with.

DTAG_CSR_E_Innenumschlag_Nachdruck.indd   3DTAG_CSR_E_Innenumschlag_Nachdruck.indd   3 23.10.2008   9:29:56 Uhr23.10.2008   9:29:56 UhrDear Readers,
Deutsche T elekom’s core business is providing our society with all imaginable services and amenities required for a connected 
life and work. This, no doubt, is a question of doing the job in a responsible manner. After all, our success depends on the tr ust 
and confidence of our customers – something which depends on the responsibility we show in our conduct towards society.
Three of the greatest challenges we face are combating severe climate change, providing equal opportunities for all to particip ate 
in the IT world as well as enhanced services for connected life and work. T o achieve this, we intend to offer new concepts and 
specific solutions and have focused our corporate responsibility activities to this purpose.
Digitization of business processes and replacing traveling with modern communications media are the essentials for improved 
energy efficiency in the global economy. According to the latest “Smart 2020” report, it is possible to reduce 7.8 gigatons CO 2 
worldwide in the next decade – a quantity higher than the USA’s current CO 2 emissions per year – by employing information 
and communications technologies in a targeted manner. It goes without saying that we intend setting an example here.
Secondly, we are striving to make it possible for all, irrespective of their origin or level of education, to have their just s hare in 
the IT world. Owing to the demographics in our country, Germany is also dependent on the potential of its senior citizens, 
people who have grown up without the amenities of the Internet and mobile communications. We are also concerned about 
underprivileged children and youth, who are of course exposed to new technologies, but who often cannot learn to use them at school or in their professional life. Another challenge we face is setting up Internet connections in remote areas. In Germa ny 
today, we have one of the best networks of high-speed Internet connections worldwide. Future developments in the Internet 
will, however, pose far greater challenges to network and line capacities. The private sector alone will not be able to finance  the 
investments required to overcome these challenges. The social duty of preventing a regional digital divide in the long term means that new political and regulatory solutions will have to be found.
Finally, the third challenge to be tackled is improving the quality of working and living in modern society with our services. 
This calls for not only developing and implementing network technologies but also openly facing their consequences, for example , 
of having a constant “virtual” presence during one’s working life.  
We are proud to say that Deutsche T elekom’s contributions in the fields of sustainability and corporate responsibility receive 
international acclaim, and have committed ourselves to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. 
It is best to get your own impression of our commitment and services in the field of corporate responsibility. In that regard, 
we would be grateful to receive your views on our work. We value your opinion and wish you happy reading, hoping that you will 
find a wealth of information and maybe also be inspired.
Bonn, September 2008Sincerely, 
René Obermann

known as Mobile Communications USA with over 28.7 million customers 
(as of December 31, 2007).
The portfolio that Deutsche T elekom offers under the T-Mobile product 
brand in its focus markets in Europe and the USA consists of voice and data 
services along with mobile broadband services.
Business Customers. Through its 56,000 employees, the Business 
Customers operating segment delivers integrated ICT solutions to T-Systems customers in more than 20 countries. Its activities are focused on the 
Western European countries of Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the United 
Kingdom, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands. All in all, the 
Business Customers segment looks after 60 multinational corporations and 
public institutions and around 160,000 large, medium and small enterprises.
Group Headquarters & Shared Services.  Group Headquarters manages 
all strategic and cross-segment processes. Operating services that are not 
directly connected to the company’s core business, such as real estate and fleet management, are provided by Shared Services.
New 2007 Group strategy.
In response to future global trends as well as the specific challenges facing Deutsche T elekom, the Group developed its strategy known as “Focus, fix 
and grow” in 2007. Presentation to the general public followed in March 
2007 at the press conference on Deutsche T elekom’s financial statements. Actual implementation began in June 2007 with the foundation of the 
three service companies and introduction of the new brand architecture.
The Group strategy is geared to the following four action fields and finds 
application in all three of the Group’s business areas (Broadband/Fixed 
Network, Mobile Communications and Business Customers): 
1. Improve competitiveness in Germany. 
2.  Grow abroad with mobile communications. 3.  Mobilize the Internet and Web 2.0 trends. 4.  Develop ICT business.
 See 2007 Annual Report.International market presence.
Ever since its foundation, the company’s home market has been in Germany. In the meantime, every third member of Deutsche T elekom’s 
240,000-strong workforce is employed abroad. Our focus markets lie 
in Europe, the USA and Asia.
In 2007, Deutsche T elekom pushed ahead with its internationalization 
activities by making several acquisitions in the international arena. 
With the acquisition of mobile carrier Orange in the Netherlands and the takeover of SunCom in the USA, we improved our competitive position 
in Europe and the USA. 
Group structure and operating segments.
Diverging from previous presentations of the Group structure that were based 
on the three strategic business areas known as Mobile Communications, 
Broadband/Fixed Network, Business Customers and, in addition, Group Headquarters & Shared Services, reporting is based on the following five 
operating segments for the first time in the year ending December 31, 2007:
Broadband/Fixed Network. The Broadband/Fixed Network segment offers 
consumers “all they need at home” for telephony and broadband Internet 
under the T-Home product brand, from state-of-the-art fixed-network infra-
structures and high-speed Internet access to innovative multimedia services. 
In Germany’s fiercely competitive market, T-Home leads the field in DSL broadband lines. Outside Germany, the operating segment has a presence 
in particular in Central and Eastern Europe in Hungary, Croatia, Slovakia, 
Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Montenegro. 
With more than 119 million customers (as of December 31, 2007), T-Mobile 
International AG is one of the world’s leading mobile carriers. Its activities 
are spread over two operating segments. 
Mobile Communications Europe. The operating segment known as Mobile 
Communications Europe covers all of T-Mobile International AG’s activities in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland and the Czech Republic. Besides these, it also includes the Group’s mobile operations in Slovakia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Hungary. Corporate proﬁ  le. 
Deutsche T elekom is one of the world’s leading providers of integrated services in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. With the three product brands T-Home, T-Mobile and T-Systems, the organization offers its customers state-of-the-art technologies and services from a single source under its “T” brand. Deutsche T elekom’s portfolio covers mobile communications, fixed-line telephony, and broadband Internet and ICT solutions for business customers all over the globe. Corporate profile

The motivation and know-how of our employees in all departments and at 
all levels play a vital role in successful implementation of the Group strategy 
and thus in a sustainable future for Deutsche T elekom. The HR strategy 
has therefore been developed in close coordination with the Group strategy. 
Like the Group strategy, it is geared to the four core strategic initiatives 
“Competitive workforce,” “T alent agenda,” “Service culture” and “HR@2009.”

Business development. 
For Deutsche T elekom, the 2007 financial year was again marked by strong competition in the telecommunications industry and by ongoing 
technological change. Nonetheless, the Group succeeded in achieving 
a stable level of growth. T otal revenues were raised to EUR 62.5 billion in 
the 2007 financial year. Deutsche T elekom generated more than 50 percent 
of its revenues outside Germany. Consequently, the share of international 
revenue rose again, this time by 3.8 percent.
All in all, Deutsche T elekom has made major progress in business develop-
ment. It has already reached the financial targets that were communicated 
at the start of 2007:
– It increased Group revenue by 1.9 percent to EUR 62.5 billion. 
–  The company overfulfilled the forecast figure, achieving EUR 19.3 billion 
for adjusted EBITDA. 
–  Free cash flow increased to EUR 6.6 billion. In this respect, it not only 
topped last year’s figure of EUR 6.3 billion (before payments for procure-
ment of licenses totaling EUR 3.3 billion) by 4.4 percent but also our improved forecast of EUR 6.5 billion of November 2007. 
Besides this, the company successfully reduced its net debt in 2007 to EUR 37.2 billion. As a result of the positive development in all key perfor-
mance indicators, the Board of Management at Deutsche T elekom and 
the Supervisory Board decided to increase the dividend paid out to share-holders from EUR 0.72 to EUR 0.78 for each individual dividend-bearing 
no par value share for the 2007 financial year.
Net value added. The stable economic growth at Deutsche T elekom in 
2007 again enabled the Group to make a major contribution towards 
economic and social stability in Germany. This is clearly reflected in the 
company’s net value added, a figure that reveals the form in which enter-prise value is distributed among individual stakeholders, for example as 
wages or taxation.Socially responsible investment. We see the bundling and profiling process of our corporate responsibility (CR) activities, which was launched in 2007, as an opportunity to make us more attractive for our investors over the long term. Our socially responsible investment (SRI) roadshows held in June 2007 and February 2008 were designed to give investors who are interested in sustainability issues an insight into our activities and to provide a forum for discussion. Our excellent results again in the 2007 SRI ratings provide crucial guidance for investors and helped to ensure that the T-Share is listed in the leading sustainability indices and funds. 
 See page 60. Deutsche T elekom’s net value added is the result of adding sales revenue to cash inflow from the sale of asse ts less oper 
ating costs and other expendi-
ture. In contrast to the statement of income, the net value added only takes account of real payment flows. Thus, for example, deferred tax expenditure and the recognition of provisions have no impact on net value added for the reporting year. Although these costs are deducted from net profit in the statement of income, they are not linked to any current payments to stake-holder groups. Outpayments in this respect are scheduled for the future and will only be accounted for in net value added in future years.

of the economy and society. Based on this insight, Deutsche T elekom has committed itself to the principles of sustainability and incorporates social, environmental and financial goals into its corporate strategy. We communicate and cooperate on a wide basis with internal and external stakeholders and take into account the social expectations demanded from an ICT company in a comprehensive and systematic manner. This focus on stakeholder dialog helps create the prerequisites that enable us to assume full responsibility for the impact of our business activities and to improve our competitiveness. In order to preserve the trust of our customers, we wish to underline our explicit corporate commitment to data protection and also other relevant issues.

Building on previous activities. 
Corporate culture and corporate values.
T aking on social responsibility has a long tradition at Deutsche T elekom 
and has been an integral part of our corporate culture for many years. Corporate responsibility is the basis of our vision for making Deutsche T elekom the global leader for connected life and work. How we realize this 
vision and find the right balance between the expectations of our employees 
and stakeholders is most aptly expressed by our “T-Spirit” values: 
 201Manifold external obligations.  Our commitment to social responsibility 
is expr essed in se
veral domestic and international voluntary agreements 
through which we have recognized many of the principles and standards 
drawn up by our stakeholders and voluntarily integrated them into our own corporate culture or adopted them in our management system. On these 
lines, the Group was one of the first ICT companies to join the UN Global 
Compact on July 26, 2000 and committed itself to complying with the ten 
principles of the initiative. We have thus taken on the obligation to respect human rights, maintain suitable labor standards and concentrate our 
efforts on protecting the environment and fighting corruption. Likewise, the 
Social Charter, adopted by the Board of Management in 2003, represents 
our commitment to fundamental social principles, which above all aim to 
improve human rights and labor and environmental standards. The OECD 
guidelines for multinational companies, the environmental management systems of ISO and the core labor standards of the International Labor 
Organization (ILO) are an important basis for our corporate activities. 
Deutsche T elekom was one of the first companies in Germany, together 
with Deutsche Bank, BP and Daimler, to sign the charter of diversity in 
December 2006 in line with its commitment to cultural diversity.

The demands of society on global corporations have grown considerably 
over the past few years. External stakeholders in particular, backed by 
investor associations, rating agencies and the media, articulate their various demands more emphatically than before. Along with the increased 
significance which corporate responsibility has experienced in the public eye, we as an ICT service provider feel a special obligation to help shape a sustainable future. 
CR as a management issue. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we began to 
bundle all activities in connection with sustainability and social commit-ment in a separate unit under the term Corporate Responsibility (CR). 
By anchoring this within the Chairman’s department, it is now possible to 
steer and control corporate responsibility centrally within the Group across 
all its business areas and subsidiaries. Concurrently, we took stock of our 
strategy process. We reviewed and assessed the CR-relevant documents, guidelines and management processes of Deutsche T elekom that have 
been in effect up until now. In order to do full justice in future to the internal 
and external expectations on us as an ICT company, we began creating 
stakeholder demand profiles in December 2007. T o this end, we conducted 
interviews with internal and external stakeholders, analyzed the performance 
of major competitors and the results of several rating agencies. The findings 
were summarized, filtered, evaluated and subsequently used for an internal gap analysis of our CR performance.
New tasks and a new understanding.  With our new CR strategy we are 
giving Deutsche T elekom a new organizational and operative basis to fulfill 
its corporate responsibility. On September 2, 2008, the Board of Manage-ment passed a resolution which defines our new CR understanding, the 
resulting tasks and the organizational framework. The resolution is based 
on the following claim: 
Deutsche T elekom intends to become a worldwide leader in corporate 
responsibility. The Group commits itself to a responsible conduct in terms 
of sustainability and strives to find a lasting balance between the financial, social and ecological impacts of its activities. Furthermore, Deutsche 
T elekom has committed itself to incorporate every aspect of sustainability into its corporate activities. The company seeks an active and intensive dialog with its stakeholders and conducts such dialogs in an open and 
transparent manner.
Already, Deutsche T elekom is a trailblazer in numerous areas of action such 
as climate protection and supply chain management. This fact strengthens 
our conviction that we can achieve our goal of being a worldwide leader 
in CR within just a few years.Consequences and new CR objectives. The new CR strategy has a 
fundamental impact on Deutsche T elekom’s business processes:
–  On a mid to long-term basis, CR management will span the entire value 
chain of the company, striving to enhance its value and sustainability. 
This includes the creation of CR key performance indicators (KPIs), 
developing a CR roadmap and monitoring our targets.
–  The sustainability aspects will be considered when weighing up business-
relevant management decisions. 
–  Social change processes are to be integrated into product and service 
development at an early stage. As a result, CR aspects will be better incorporated in future innovation processes.
–  Deutsche T elekom fosters an active exchange with its employees and 
external stakeholders with the aim of incorporating their expectations in 
company decisions and consolidating their trust in the company.
Sharper profile in strategic fields of activity.  The new CR strategy defines 
three fields of activity which are closely connected to our core business 
and are considered particularly relevant by the public and our stakeholders: 
–  Connected life and work,
–  Connect the unconnected, and
–  Low-carbon society.
Deutsche T elekom assumes the key position of an “enabler” in all three 
CR fields of activity, by enabling the members of society to attain important 
achievements. The company opens up new opportunities in both business 
and private life; it creates opportunities for many people so far cut off from 
the information and knowledge-based society to be part of it; and helps its customers and employees in achieving significant reductions in CO
2 
emissions.
Sustainability in connected life and work.  Our contribution to a connected 
life and work is part of our core business. From a CR point of view, the main 
question is: How can we support our customers and employees in improving 
their quality of life and work? We see the major challenges in shaping the developments in connected life and work with model and convincing 
concepts. Furthermore, we want to provide people with useful services, enabling them to have a better quality of life and full trust in safe ICT services and processes.10 | 11

not enjoy the possibility of using digital media due to cultural, economic 
or health-related reasons. Our central question in this area of action is: 
What can we do to enable these people to be part of our infor mation 
and knowledge society? Deutsche T elekom has done a lot in the past to 
accomplish this task. Nonetheless, there is a lot to do for promoting equal opportunities and helping people to bridge the so-called digital divide. 
We continue our unceasing efforts to integrate underprivileged groups and 
offer new business models, projects and services. Providing broadband 
and user-friendly technology for all is therefore also a central issue in this 
area of action.
Ways to becoming a low-carbon society. ICT processes are inevitably 
linked with energy consumption and CO
2 emissions. At the same time, 
they can also play a vital role in saving energy and reducing emissions. 
Our central question in this context is: What can we do to enable us and our customers to effectively contribute towards climate protection? The major 
challenges in this area of action are upgrading energy efficiency and the use of clean energy. We therefore plan to promote innovations which help 
us to sever the link between energy consumption and CO
2 emissions. Our 
goal is to develop new products and services that have the least impact on 
the environment. This also includes the further development of our highly successful green IT concepts.
Our strategy roadmap. Our CR strategy process also includes the following 
objectives which we aim to achieve by 2010:
–  Further development and implementation of CR targets and CR KPIs
–  Creating an extended CR program based on the new targets and KPIs–  Upgrading our Group-wide environment and energy strategy–  Further development and implementation of a Group-wide e-waste 
strategy
–  Implementation of a Group-wide environment management system–  Systematic integration of sustainability aspects in product and service 
development
–  Upgrading the supply chain management
–  Developing a new, Group-wide CR communications strategy for 
enhanced stakeholder involvement
 New CR governance within the Group.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, we began setting up a new, efficient organi-zation structure for the Group-wide CR management of Deutsche T elekom. 
T o this end, we established a central strategic unit and interface at the 
beginning of 2008.
This new CR unit is organized as a separate unit within Corporate Commu-
nications, a department reporting directly to the Board Chairman. For its 
part, the CR unit reports regularly to the Board of Management, advising 
the latter on all questions concerning sustainable corporate governance and corporate responsibility. It is the task of this new unit to strategically 
steer our CR activities throughout the Group by implementing targets and 
KPIs and to make full use of the extensive CR competence within the Group.
An additional committee will be set up for anchoring and implementing 
CR within the Group. The heads of relevant central departments convene 
at least twice a year to hold a CR Board meeting. The CR Board’s mandate is to ensure that the CR strategy is embraced throughout the Group and 
the CR strategy, the Group strategy and the Group’s corporate values are 
closely interlinked. The CR Board recommends important aspects of the Group CR strategy to the Board of Management. It defines the main focus of communication and specifies the stakeholder strategy.
The CR strategy is implemented in the Group’s business areas and affiliated 
companies through topic-related projects incorporating the relevant repre-
sentatives of the operating segments and our international subsidiaries. 
This procedure requires the exchange of best-practice and supports our 
CR cooperation culture.Strategy and management

able dialog forums, whereby it will gain external expertise to advise and 
support the Board of Management and the Group as a whole in relevant 
issues. The responsibility for coordinating this will lie with Deutsche 
T elekom’s Board Representative for Sustainability and Climate Protection.
In order to firmly integrate social responsibility into business processes 
at a Group-wide level, we have adopted a multitude of CR-relevant policies 
in the past few years. All of the Group’s policies are actively communicated 
and are available to our employees via the policy database. A selection 
of our policies from different fields is outlined below:
– Environmental policy and climate protection
– Code of Conduct– Social Charter– Electromagnetic fields
– Diversity policy
– Sustainable procurement strategy– Procurement policies
– Sustainability strategy guideline
– Donation policy– Data and information protection policy– Group data protection manual–  Group guideline for the continual improvement of data protection 
and security
– Privacy Code of Conduct
– Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) voluntary agreement
–  Code of conduct of mobile operators for the protection of minors from 
unsuitable mobile content
– Group-internal corporate governance policy– Anti-fraud policy
Compliance management. 
Compliance with laws and provisions is the minimum requirement for good and responsible governance and the foundation of our corporate responsibility. In order to create the prerequisites for complete compliance, we have drawn up a binding Code of Conduct for all our employees and have set up Group-wide organizational structures.
Group-wide compliance organization. As early as 2005, Deutsche T elekom 
created a central organization for all compliance issues. Its mandate is 
to support the corporate activities in the area of value and compliance 
management as well as for specific governance tasks. It draws up Group-
wide compliance standards and supervises their translation into processes, 
for instance, the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (S-OX) into our internal control system or the monitoring of the audit services policy. 
The unit’s tasks also include the further development of our whistleblower 
process and the coordination of our anti-fraud management.Deutsche T elekom has additionally established a Compliance Committee, which supports the Board of Management in fulfilling its tasks of setting 
up, maintaining and monitoring the necessary structures for a functioning 
value and compliance management.
The members of the Compliance Committee are experienced managers 
from Compliance, Legal Affairs, Corporate Audit, Group Security and 
Human Resources. The Chief Compliance Officer, appointed by the Board 
of Management, is the chairman of the Compliance Committee. He reports 
to the Group’s Board of Management and directly to the Audit Committee 
and the Supervisory Board. A Compliance Officer has been appointed in each of the strategic business areas.
Group Code of Conduct. A Code of Conduct binding for all Deutsche 
T elekom employees was drawn up in spring 2006. Translated into numerous languages, it addresses all staff, including temporary staff and advisers of Deutsche T elekom. This code is the basis for an open, democratic, and 
legally sound corporate culture to which we are committed and which we have to practice each and every day. This Code of Conduct means that 
Deutsche T elekom fulfills the requirements of the stakeholders and socially 
responsible investment (SRI) ratings for a comprehensible, value-based and legally responsible corporate governance and creates a reliable ethical framework for its business. Moreover, we anticipate that the implementation of our Code of Conduct will provide an additional support for our corporate and service culture and, among our employees, will lead to an increased awareness of inappropriate conduct. Fundamental elements of the Code of 
Conduct are the observance of minimum social standards, a commitment 
to sustainable business practices, data protection at a high level, as well 
as safeguarding the assets and values of the Group. The Code of Conduct also urges the employees to make the most of the opportunities and potential for sustainable value creation within the Group and demands that foreign cultures are respected. It provides guidance on the right behavior 
in the event of conflicts of interest and prohibits corrupt behavior or money 
laundering. The donation policy is also clearly regulated by the Code. 
Fair behavior is demanded when dealing with suppliers, shareholders and competitors. Complementary to this, the Code of Conduct contains 
several basic principles on promoting the employability of the staff, their personal and cultural diversity, and on interacting with labor representatives. T o efficiently track down violations of the Code of Conduct, employees are 
urged to notify the company of violations or suspected misconduct. Various 
contacts and portals are available for this purpose. If desired, it is also 
possible to give anonymous tips. We guarantee that tip-offs will be treated confidentially. 12 | 13
13_DTAG_CSR_2008_EN   1313_DTAG_CSR_2008_EN   13 09.10.2008   16:23:36 Uhr09.10.2008   16:23:36 UhrThe Group-wide implementation of the Code of Conduct is a process 
which plays an important role in the integration of our CR activities. The 
Code of Conduct builds a bridge between the joint set of values of our Group, “T-Spirit,” and the numerous statutory and non-statutory standards or guidelines which affect our corporate action and the actions of our 
employees. All policies and guidelines, including the Code of Conduct, can be viewed by all persons involved in the policy database available on 
the Group intranet. We support the implementation of the Code of Conduct 
by using our internal media facilities. The managers of all our majority 
shareholdings make sure that all teams are familiar with the provisions and 
recommendations of the Code of Conduct and that they find wide accep-tance.
Anti-fraud management. The anti-fraud management is an integral part 
of our Group-wide compliance management. It serves the systematic 
prevention of white-collar crime and represents an essential element of 
our corporate culture. Deutsche T elekom’s fraud policy of February 2006 
outlines its fundamental principles. In addition, it renders a distinct defini-tion of the term, lists typical cases and, based on several fundamental 
principles, presents a catalog of measures for fighting white-collar crime. 
We can achieve a preventive effect through a clear organizational assign-
ment of tasks, intensified training programs and enhanced care above all 
in delegating responsibilities. We systematically analyze occurring fraud risks and document the cases occurred. In order to be able to intervene 
quickly when corruption is suspected, we have set up contacts in all organi-
zational units and publicize these in a suitable manner. Tip-offs can be 
given anonymously. Employees who suspect corruption and do not wish to 
approach their direct or indirect superiors or contact persons can use our 
violations portals.
Code of Conduct violations portals.  As part of its value and compliance 
program, Deutsche T elekom set up, on introducing the Code of Conduct on 
February 19, 2006, a violations portal known as “Ethics Line” as a “channel” for information on Code of Conduct violations. Based on the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, two further reporting channels have been made available, the Business Keeper Monitoring System (BKMS) and the portal via the Supervisory Board’s office for the whistleblower process. The channels differ according to their degree of anonymity and their legal basis. 
The statistical analysis of the information obtained via the “Ethics Line” 
shows that the regulations of the Code of Conduct are being observed within the Group and the related offers are finding great response.Transparent corporate governance. Deutsche T elekom meets the strict 
requirements of the U.S. capital markets, specifically S-OX Section 404. 
T o provide evidence of this, we have implemented a procedure for the systematic assessment of the efficiency of the internal control system for financial reporting. The control system is constantly being optimized. 
Its functionality was confirmed for the fiscal year 2007 by the external auditors and our Internal Audit unit. Deutsche T elekom has also committed 
itself to the German Corporate Governance Code. The code summarizes 
a series of regulations valid in Germany and provides recommendations 
for more transparency in corporate governance as well as greater autono -
 my of supervisory boards and external auditors. In the reporting period, the Group complied without exception with all recommendations of the 
government commission for the German Corporate Governance Code.
In the Group management report, which forms part of its annual report, 
Deutsche T elekom states that it is involved in several judicial and extrajudicial 
proceedings with authorities, competitors and other involved parties.
 See 2007 Annual Report.
Integrated risk and opportunities management. Deutsche T elekom  
emplo
ys a comprehensive risk and opportunities management system. 
The system helps us to consistently take advantage of our opportunities 
after due consideration of the associated risks. The early identification, assessment and management of risks and opportunities are integral 
components of the Group-wide planning, control and monitoring systems. 
In the scope of strategy and innovation development, we also assess 
Deutsche T elekom’s opportunities using comprehensive market analyses 
with regard to specific customer segments and markets.
Reporting on the fundamental risks and opportunities is carried out 
every quarter – and, in the event of unexpected events, also ad hoc – and presented to the Board of Management who subsequently informs the Supervisory Board. The risk management system and in-depth discussion of the risk report are also an integral part of the meetings of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
We constantly optimize our risk and opportunities management system 
with regard to all relevant stakeholder issues and subject our risk manage-
ment processes to regular internal audits. The efficiency of our early risk identification system is reviewed by the external auditors who audit the annual report. The system complies with the statutory requirements and conforms to the German cor porate governance principles.Strategy and management
Compliance managementStakeholder dialogs
14_DTAG_CSR_2008_EN   1414_DTAG_CSR_2008_EN   14 09.10.2008   16:23:37 Uhr09.10.2008   16:23:37 UhrStakeholder dialogs. 
Holding responsible dialogs with our various stakeholder groups – including 
our customers, shareholders, suppliers, local residents and employees as well as NGOs, associations and scientific and political institutions – is an important steering instrument within our CR management. It helps us to evaluate corporate risks more efficiently and optimize our CR commitment. These dialogs also show us where we ought to intensify our commitment and how we can further improve our processes and products. We use the insights gained from these dialogs for the continual improvement of our CR strategy. T o this end, stakeholder expectations are systematically registered and assessed according to their relevance. In return, we secure 
the stakeholders’ understanding for the business activities of our company 
and their acceptance for the necessary steps taken. In areas in which we 
consider Deutsche T elekom to bear a major responsibility, we additionally 
initiate dialogs and actively ask stakeholders about their expectations.
T o coordinate our diverse dialog activities, we have created special 
competences both centrally at Corporate Communications level and at 
the level of national companies and have anchored stakeholder dialog in 
our CR management. This enables us to classify the messages correctly, 
select the correct channel for the dialog and identify those stakeholders 
who will push the discussions on specific issues or who can help find solutions for the respective issues. An early warning system helps us to 
determine changes in the public perception of key issues in good time 
and allows us to react accordingly by offering dialog where appropriate 
and initiate CR processes if required.
Constructive exchange. Openness and transparency are of great impor-
tance when holding discussions with people from different social and 
cultural backgrounds. This is our experience from dialogs with local resi-dent groups or when exchanging ideas with UN representatives. It is part of our corporate culture to be open to our discussion partners, showing them respect and trying to see things from their perspective. This way, 
we can make a major contribution to improving the climate of discussion and communicate measures we hold necessary besides helping to find 
solutions with our know-how as an ICT company.
Deutsche T elekom holds stakeholder dialogs at completely different levels, 
including platforms such as the Group Sustainability Day, which we have been staging as the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Day since 2007. At these events, we have discussed current CR issues with up to 350 participants from the fields of science, politics, NGOs, business and culture. At the first CR Day in September 2007, internal and external experts discussed the most important topics and perspectives of corporate responsibility under the slogan “Corporate success = business plus ethics.” Board Chairman René Obermann introduced Deutsche T elekom’s new CR structure and underlined the significance of a comprehensive strategic CR orientation.The “Stakeholder Dialog Day,” initiated in 2008, is a further Group-wide platform. In the first round of discussions on April 2, over 40 representatives 
from five stakeholder groups discussed the subject of “Sustainable pro-curement as a global challenge.” Suppliers, analysts and employees, as well as representatives from NGOs and universities, brought forward a number 
of suggestions. The focus was on energy efficiency, working conditions as well as waste and disposal management. The participants testified to 
the good performance of Deutsche T elekom, but did point out that there is 
room for improvement; we are currently following up these valuable sug-
gestions and examining the relevant points in-depth. As a result, a distinct 
requirements profile is taking shape for a responsible design of the value chain. 
 See page 39 f.
We have set up various forums in the individual subsidiaries on environment and sustainability, for instance, t he “Climat 
e days” at T-Mobile, where we 
were happy to welcome as our guests the Hesse Society for Ornithology and Nature Protection at the T-Mobile headquarters in Bonn. The main focus of the event, which was held in cooperation with Deutsche Umwelt-
hilfe, was on various programs for wildlife conservation and environmental 
protection.
At regular intervals, we conduct comprehensive representative employee 
surveys. In order to understand the current mood of our workforce, we also 
launched pulse surveys known as “spirit@telekom” on the intranet in 2007. 
Staff members can submit their opinions on specific issues by filling out 
brief, precise questionnaires. Based on the huge success of “spirit@telekom” 
as an internal steering instrument, we will launch the pulse surveys at a Group-wide level in 2008.

Embracing responsibility. Deutsche T elekom is a member of se v eral 
international committees, organizations and initiatives who are engaged in CR relevant issues. As a global player, we consider it our responsibility to have an active part in social initiatives, such as Global Compact, to commit ourselves to the implementation of their principles worldwide and shape the future of these initiatives. Since we recognize major opportunities in the efficient management of CO
2 emissions and are keen on pressing 
forward, together with other institutions, with the development of global 
financial instruments for combating climate change, we play an active part 
in the Carbon Disclosure Project surveys. T o take on our responsibility in 
areas that are beyond the scope of influence of individual companies, we 
work closely with other companies in the ICT industry. The founding of the 
“Global e-Sustainability Initiative” (GeSI) in 2001 is a good example of this. 14 | 15

Regulation and policy-making –  
in dialog with the decision-makers.  
In most of the countries where Deutsche T elekom 
operates, telecommunications networks and ser-
vices are still governed by a host of special 
regulations and obligations, which are imposed 
alongside the general legal requirements appli-cable to all companies, such as competition law 
and consumer protection. Particularly in a fast-
paced industry like ICT, which is developing at an 
exceptionally rapid pace, the overall legal frame-work is not only pivotal to business success in the modern world, but also exerts a significant influ-
ence on a company’s investments in the infra-structure, technology and services of the future. 
The political, legal and regulatory decisions that 
are taken today will govern the availability of 
future consumer and business products. Politi-
cians, governments and regulatory bodies there-fore rely heavily on the information they receive 
first-hand from consumers and companies. Addi-
tionally, ICT companies have the requisite techni-
cal expertise and understanding of investment 
requirements.
Competency, credibility and integrity.As one of the largest companies in the telecom-
munications industry, Deutsche T elek
om is a pre-
ferred point of contact for decision-makers from politics, government and regulatory authorities. 
The Group also actively pursues every opportu-
nity for in-depth dialog with representatives of such institutions. Such dialog embraces a whole 
range of issues, from questions directly affecting 
the Deutsche T elekom at home and abroad, to 
discussions on the nature of the information and 
communications business, to general issues sur-rounding the industrial and sector environment. 
As well as participating in public hearings and 
events, Deutsche T elekom also maintains a high 
profile in the political and parliamentary arena 
by participating in individual debates and sub-
mitting written comments.Our opinions are firmly based on the facts, and unequivocally represent the company’s views. 
This ensures that they are trusted by recipients 
and readers, and can be incorporated into the 
opinion-shaping process by politicians, govern-ments and regulatory authorities. Deutsche 
T elekom’s long-term competency, credibility and 
integrity, both at home and abroad, is therefore 
pivotal in this regard, both in terms of the com-pany as a whole, and for each of its individual members. Many of the company’s written opin-
ions are published by the authorities, associa-tions and committees that receive them. It is of 
paramount concern to Deutsche T elekom that its 
relationships with political decision-makers 
should be characterized by transparency and 
trust. This also extends to our refusal to support the work of any political party with donations. 
Deutsche T elekom is an active player in the 
numerous trade associations of which it is a 
member. In Germany, for example, these include 
central economic associations and the ICT indus-try association BITKOM. At European level, the Group plays an active role in sector associations 
such as the European T elecommunications Net-
work Operators’ Association ETNO, and the GSM 
Association, where political framework condi-
tions and technical standards for the telecommu-
nications sector are discussed, and also in cross-
sectoral associations. These include, for instance, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), 
which aims to promote free trade, economic 
growth and cooperation, as well as the World 
Economic Forum (WEF), whose goal is to pro-
mote global economic growth and social devel-opment.The availability of information and communication services and their underlying infra-structures has become an increasingly crucial factor of modern life and financial success. As a result, the rapid development and constant evolution of information and communi-cation technologies (ICT) poses particular challenges for decision-makers in political bodies and regulatory authorities.

As a full member and one of the driving forces, we have committed our-
selves, among other things, to promoting multi-stakeholder cooperations. 
The focus of our work is the cross-sector collaboration of companies 
with governments and NGOs for the development of sustainable solutions 
in areas of action such as climate change, globalization, supply chain 
management and electronic waste.
Our membership with econsense, the Forum for Sustainable Development 
of German Business is an example of our commitment in domestic initiatives. 
The business network is a dialog platform and think-tank for sustainable 
development and corporate responsibility. Deutsche T elekom has an active part in project and working groups and is also on the steering committee 
of econsense.
 205  A comprehensive list of all further platforms in which Deutsche 
T elekom is involved is available in our 2008 CR Online Report.   
Reporting based on relevance criteria.  
In order to determine the fundamental CR topics for the reporting system of Deutsche T elekom, we organized a materiality workshop in December 2007, during which the relevance of the topics was assessed from the viewpoint of our stakeholders and from our company perspective. We have reported on the topics that were considered important or very important for both sides in this printed report. The remaining issues are included in the online report, or, if assessed as being of little relevance, they remain unmentioned for the present. On the stakeholder side, we introduced the criteria of evaluating the dominance of the topics in public discussion and their impact on the environment and society. Also, the proximity of the topics to the corporate activities and to the sustainability performance of the Group as well as compliance with internal standards were included in the assessment. For our part, we investigated the impact of the topics on the economic, ecological or social performance of the company as well as the intensity of the discussions within the Group. Based on these criteria, the managers from different departments and from headquarters submitted their evaluation. The stakeholder side was additionally represented by externally commissioned benchmark and media analyses.Focus on the common good.
Deutsche T elekom operates in a tough competi-
tive environment, bot h at national le
vel and in a 
global context. We have clear-cut ideas about the prevailing legal, political and regulatory frame-work conditions. However, with more than 150 million customers worldwide, we are also firmly committed to safeguarding the interests of our customer base and promoting the common good. For example, Deutsche T elekom engages in nu-merous voluntary commitments (self-regulation) worldwide, joining forces with other companies, political groups and, of course, civil organiza-tions. Some of these commitments are examined in greater depth elsewhere in this report, e.g. in the sections outlining our policies on climate pro-tection and child protection. Above and beyond this, many of Deutsche T elekom’s wide-ranging political commitments also benefit consumers and small businesses directly. Examples include our initiative to supply broadband to rural regions by providing additional mobile communication frequencies (digital dividend), and a regulatory framework designed to promote investment in high-performance broadband networks (optical fibers). Deutsche T elekom is also politically active in the drive to improve customer service for all consumers. Having been extensively involved in the German Government’s IT Summit, in 2007 Deutsche T elekom joined forces with a host of representatives from industry, trade associations, academia and the government to help draft a “Guide to consumer-friendly customer support,” and was also one of the first companies to sign this guide.

Customers, our corporate responsibility is  centered around the needs and expectations of our customers. From 2007 on, we have been concentrating our activities increasingly on those areas in which we possess the expertise to effectively  support our customers as a strong ICT service provider, specially allowing them more opportunities in shaping their private and working life more successfully. 
It is expected from us throughout that our products and services are accessible to all users without 
exception. The contact with new media brings with it, in children, young people and parents alike, the desire for a more secure online environment. For many years now, there has been a growing challenge on protecting the privacy of our customers and their personal data. Doing justice to all these needs, we have positioned ourselves as a reliable partner enabling connected life and work for our customers. Indeed, providing comprehensive service to our customers is always our main task. After all, the variety and complexity of telecommunications products includes the demand for providing premium service. More information on Deutsche T elekom’s service centricity can be found in our detailed 2008 CR Online Report.

Equal opportunity for all in the digital age.
As an ICT service provider, Deutsche T elekom considers it its task to provide 
everyone with a digital connection, giving them the opportunity to over-come the widening gap, the so-called digital divide. One way in which we make this possible is by pressing on with the enhancement of existing  networks. 
 302
However, the digital divide is not always restricted to densely and sparsely populated regions. Social barriers t oo ar 
e a cause for impeding the digital 
linking of different sections of the population: handicaps which may restrict speech, hearing, or motor activity, also curtail the use of digital media. Owing to the demographic change – which is particularly conspicuous in Germany and which also poses a formidable challenge in other markets outside Germany – the number of senior citizens not able to enjoy the  maximum benefit of modern ICT and services without outside help is  growing. In the case of migrants, the language barrier frequently obstructs 
access to ICT. Moreover, insufficient education opportunities and limited 
financial resources of families could turn out to be an additional barrier that 
hampers certain sections of the population from participating in  significant 
developments in the digital age. Deutsche T elekom wants to be a reliable partner for all people, enabling them to keep abreast with the latest developments in ICT – with easy-to-use products, individual training and services that help overcome such barriers. 
Connecting people with mobile communications. All over the world, 
mobile communications technology is regarded a boon when it comes to connecting people even in remote areas. Often, it is the only technology 
that enables setting up a well functioning and profitable electronic commu-
nications network, thereby making its contribution towards being part of 
the digital society so essential. It is therefore no wonder that in countries 
with a relatively young telecommunications infrastructure mobile coverage is often greater than the fixed network coverage. In regions where the 
upgrading of fixed networks proves to be uneconomical or often even 
impossible, mobile and wireless communications offer the inhabitants 
affordable access to the information society, thus securing sustainable 
social and economic progress of the region. This is true, for instance, in 
 several central and Eastern European countries where Deutsche T elekom 
has a strong presence.Customers

However, mobile communications technology is also a great help in bridging 
the digital divide in regions with an excellent telecommunications network. 
A report of the U.S. Department of Education’s National Institute on Dis-
ability and Rehabilitation Research confirmed in February 2008 that today 
85 percent of disabled people in the USA use mobile technologies. Com-
pared to the reports from 2001 to 2006, the figure has risen by 13 percent. The majority of those surveyed classified the cell phone as the most impor-
tant technological aid in everyday life. No doubt, many of the services 
introduced on the mass market play a significant role in making life easier 
for people with disabilities. Compared to standard voice telephony, short 
message service (SMS), videotelephony or instant messaging (IM) provide communicating possibilities cut out to satisfy the needs of people who are 
deaf, hard of hearing or speech-impaired, enabling them, at the same time, 
to remove the barriers between themselves and able-bodied people who 
are equally well versed with these technologies. 
Competent use of media. Media competency signifies the ability to 
 reliably work with the media – especially new media such as the Internet. In the meantime it has become a basic requirement for finding one’s way 
around in the professional world as well as in everyday life. Similar to the 
discrepancies observed in gaining access to new media, the skill to confi-
dently deal with them is also not uniform among the population. T o make 
senior citizens familiar with the latest technology, our Hungarian subsidiary, Magyar T elekom, for instance, offers Internet courses specially catered to people above 55. One reason being that the Internet in particular can be a vital aid in everyday life for older people. Confident use of the Internet 
can, for instance, save weary traveling, simplify arduous shopping, ease 
cumbersome business with the authorities and, most importantly, revive the contact with family members and friends. The program is aimed at introducing senior citizens to digital media and was first launched at four sites in 2006. Responding to its huge popularity, we have extended this 
offer in 2007. Magyar T elekom has increased the number of courses and 
has also introduced a further training course for advanced participants.
Improving media competency among teachers, educators and students 
alike is the goal of the Internet project, “T eachT oday,” which Deutsche 
T elekom launched at the beginning of 2008, together with 13 other 
 companies and the European Schoolnet (EUN). The Internet portal 
www.teachtoday.eu offers material aimed at supporting teachers in 
 initiating a discussion with their students on the risks and opportunities 
involved in using new media as well as imparting a sense of confident 
and responsible use of new technologies.

Products without barriers. T o give ev er yone, irrespective of their age, 
media competency or disability, the opportunity to use telecommunication technologies without restrictions, Deutsche T elekom has been developing special products and services. T ogether with the German Society for the Hearing Impaired (Deutsche Gesellschaft der Hörgeschädigten – Selbsthilf e und Fachverbände e. V.), we 
have been running the TESS project (www.tess-relay-dienste.de) since June 1, 2007 in Germany to provide barrier-free and independent telephoning 
for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. TESS includes two relay services 
aimed at fulfilling the various requirements of people with these disabilities: T eSign communicates in sign language, whereas T eScript works with written 
language. In the USA, among others, T-Mobile in collaboration with Hitec 
Group International, Inc. offers telephones which are compatible with hearing 
aids and in doing so has taken up a pioneering role. For several years, so-
called TTY devices are being used by people who are deaf, hard of hearing or speech-impaired in fixed network telephony, allowing them to communicate 
via a keyboard. This technology is also available for mobile telephony. In 
addition to these technologies, the first “Design for all” end device is set to 
be launched in Germany end of 2008. Developed in the T-Laboratories, the device is a fixed network telephone which has been designed in close cooperation with senior citizens for their specific needs.
Apart from the “Design for all” device, we have launched the Sinus 200 
cordless telephone on the German market for senior citizens having to 
cope with constraints due to age. The device is targeted for senior citizens 
and was specifically designed to meet their needs. For instance, the size of 
the characters on the display has been fittingly adapted for better legibility. 
Service to meet your needs. T o become the leading service company in 
our sector automatically means providing our services for all users without 
exception. That includes the committed efforts of Deutsche T elekom 
employees aimed at developing products for people with disabilities. On these lines, for instance, a special internal training program has been initi-ated in Slovakia. Training includes, among other skills, learning sign lan-guage for better customer communication and support. T-Mobile Sloven-
sko has thus established themselves as the only mobile communications 
provider in Slovakia catering to the needs of people who are deaf or hard 
of hearing. In Germany, a Deaf hotline for people with hearing disabilities 
has been a special feature of Deutsche T elekom’s service since 2004. Thanks to this service, deaf customers can receive support in sign lan-
guage via a videophone. 
Since as early as 2004, T-Mobile UK has been running a unique and com-
prehensive concept for people with disabilities. Invoices and customer 
information are presented in various formats, for instance, in braille or as 
a recorded message.
The demographic changes in western Europe too are influencing our 
 service offers. In February 2008, three selected T elekom Shops in 
the  German cities of Vechta, Düsseldorf and Gotha presented their new 
staff concept. The age structure of the staff at these T elekom Shops was brought in line with the age structure predominant at their location.

Protecting data, ensuring data privacy. 
New organization.
In October 2008, we have created a seventh 
Board of Management department responsible  
f
or data privacy, legal affairs and compliance. The 
issue of data privacy and security has therefore been anchored at the top management level. This 
development will bring in its wake a significant 
increase in financial and human resources as well as a right to veto business decisions related to data privacy. T ogether with their staff, the new Board department will ensure that all necessary 
measures for data privacy are harmonized and 
implemented throughout the Group.
Furthermore, we will set up an independent 
privacy council comprising leading data privacy 
experts from universities, the business world and other organizations. 
Operational measures.T o guarantee the highest standards in operational 
data priv acy, Deutsche T elek
om has launched 
comprehensive action plans and is pressing on with existing measures. This is a major input in 
optimizing our security systems for safeguarding our customer information in everyday business – another step in pressing forward with our numer-ous efforts from the past years.T o increase the awareness of our employees, 
in particular thousands of executives, we will 
continue to intensify our firmly established train-
ing programs and the annual data audits. In addi-
tion, cases of misuse, even minor ones, will be 
punished internally with greater consistency and in a more resolute manner.
For customer support, we have restricted the 
scope of various activities, thereby further restrict-ing access to customer data. In addition, we have 
also introduced a shorter validity period for user 
IDs so that such IDs expire and must be renewed 
at shorter intervals. The use of fixed IP addresses 
is being extended to ensure that employees 
and sales partners may access the systems from specific computers only. Access for external sales 
partners and our staff to our systems is restricted, among others, by applications requiring trans-action authentication numbers (TAN). In the TAN procedure, the sales staff can only access cus-tomer information when they receive a valid trans-
action number from the customer. The customer gets an automatically generated TAN via text 
message on their cell phone whenever they wish 
to carry out any modifications to their contract.
Besides this, together with the Federal Criminal 
Police Office and the police, we plan to launch 
a novel concept for safeguarding the data of per-
sons at risk.Data protection has a major significance in today’s information society. Safeguarding customer information must have top priority in any company. Only through this can we build a solid fundament of trust between the customer and the company. In the current year, Deutsche T elekom is facing allegations of data misuse and flaws in the security system. Deutsche T elekom reacted immedi-ately. T o guarantee better protection for customer data, Deutsche T elekom initiated a complete 
restructuring in the area of data protection in fall 2008. By creating a new Board of Management department as well as a comprehensive action package for enhancing data protection and transparency, the Group has set a pioneering example. The experience and know-how from our experts in data protection and security as well as recommendations from external experts have been assimilated in the process.

T o enable customers in Germany with little or no knowledge of German 
access to digital media and provide them with the best possible service, 
English, Turkish and Russian-speaking staff are ready to serve. At our 
call centers, callers can express their desire to be connected to a foreign-
language staff. 
In the USA, around 12 percent of the population is of Hispanic origin. 
T-Mobile USA therefore has its Internet presence and offers numerous 
product and information brochures in Spanish. 
Rates for the underprivileged. Providing special rates for low-income 
groups and severely disabled citizens has been a tradition at Deutsche T elekom for decades. In 2007, around 1.2 million of our customers in  Germany benefited from our discounted social rates. Our international  subsidiaries too offer similar rate plans, for instance, T-Mobile in Slovakia and Hungary with discounted SMS packages. The offer is open to all, although it had originally been developed for people with hearing disabili-ties, who primarily communicate via SMS. 
Protecting children and young people. 
As an ICT provider, an essential goal of our corporate responsibility at Deutsche T elekom is enabling children and young people to use digital media and simultaneously protect them from associated risks. Learning to use the Internet with confidence and care – whether from one’s mobile set or from the Personal Computer (PC) at home – is an important aspect in the development of young people today and brings them new oppor-tunities in education, acquiring knowledge, and in social life. Routine and inexperienced use of digital media, however, also involves certain dangers. Contents, either  illegal or not suitable for one’s age group, as well as the abuse of information make the protection of young people an important concern in the Internet society too. 
In this connection, Deutsche T elekom has taken up a proactive role and is 
unceasing in its efforts to create a safe and secure Internet environment 
for protecting minors in the media. Our subsidiaries in Germany and the 
UK have assumed a pioneering position in the last few years both within 
the Group and among our competitors. A series of voluntary commitments within the Group, cooperation programs and successful measures are 
proof of this Group-wide endeavor to protect young people. Transparent communication.
One of our prime goals is the sustainable optimi-
zation of transparency in the ar ea of data priv
acy. 
A progress report prepared by the Group privacy officer will be published every year on a voluntary basis and submitted to the Federal Commissioner 
for Data Protection and the Supervisory Board 
of Deutsche T elekom. The first data privacy report 
is scheduled to be published in the first quarter 
of 2009.
In 2008, we have launched a voluntary data 
privacy certification of our customer systems. T o 
this end, we have commissioned a recognized 
monitoring agency, e.g. TÜV-IT. In addition to our 
own investigations, a certified company will 
be commissioned with the systematic auditing of our systems in order to detect weak spots. 
By implementing these two measures, Deutsche 
T elekom is set to assume a pioneering role in the ICT industry.
In October 2008, we have launched the website 
www.telekom.com/datenschutz where we pro-
vide information on the current status of data 
privacy at Deutsche T elekom in Germany. The site 
also informs readers on data privacy incidents that are the subject of criminal investigations. The 
cases are published in agreement with the com-petent authorities. This also means that we keep the supervisory bodies informed of these matters. Deutsche T elekom therefore fulfills, on its own initiative, a requirement which is still being 
debated among politicians as a possible obli-gation. In addition to the above, the website 
also presents the current measures which the 
Group implements for optimizing data privacy. 
The website will be updated regularly with addi-tional information on possible risks to customers.

Deutsche T elekom’s commitment to protecting young people, guiding 
us to a forward-looking, transparent and unceasing performance. Within 
the company, we have created the basis in all business areas for taking 
our responsibility towards minor users seriously. A youth protection officer 
counsels all departments in our Group units in Germany as well as  customers and interested parties in relevant issues. 
Of course, protecting children and minors in handling new media is not 
just the task of one party alone. Companies, governments and NGOs as 
well as parents, teachers, close associates and persons of trust all have to work together. Apart from basic legal provisions, voluntary agreements 
and taking up a commitment in social and political initiatives as well as 
with organizations is a vital method to promote the protection of children 
and minors on the Internet and in the use of modern communications 
media effectively and efficiently.
Voluntary commitments and exchange with other companies. By employ-
ing three initiatives during the reporting period, Deutsche T elekom has 
been successful in intensifying its commitment to protecting minors. 
Owing to the rapid developments in mobile Internet communications and the growing use of Internet-compatible cell phones, we decided to focus on mobile communications. 
In October 2007, T-Mobile together with other mobile communications 
 providers and FSM e. V., the voluntary self-control multimedia service 
providers association, presented their voluntary commitment on protecting 
minors in mobile communications. Based on the Code of Conduct for mobile communications providers, the commitment has been set aside for 
diverse measures which are to be implemented within the span of one year: setting up a  free-of-charge hotline for parents, a central online portal as a first-contact point for parents and teachers, individual online programs for the protection of minors developed by the participating companies, restricting the use of the Internet as well as special information for parents 
presented at the time of concluding a contract. Several of these measures, for instance, the free-of-charge hotline for parents, were introduced by 
Deutsche T elekom as early as 2006. 
At the European level, Deutsche T elekom, in addition to other mobile com-
munications providers, prepared the “European Framework for Safer Mobile Use by Younger T eenagers and Children” along with the EU  Commission in February 2007. The signatories have committed themselves to provide improved access controls for own adult content or that of content partners. Increasing awareness, classifying contents and  combating illegal content are also to be implemented to provide enhanced protection to minors in mobile communications.
T o fulfill this framework agreement, individual national voluntary commit-
ments were signed by the mobile communications industry at the latest by  February 2008 in all of Deutsche T elekom’s EU markets. In 2009, these measures are to be implemented in all EU countries. In February 2008, the worldwide initiative “Mobile Alliance against Child 
Sexual Abuse Content” was launched by GSMA, the global trade association 
for mobile communications providers, and leading mobile communications 
operators. All T-Mobile companies are members of this alliance. 
The various initiatives are interconnected effectively and thus contribute 
to establishing a comprehensive network aimed at covering all relevant 
aspects for the protection of children and minors. 
 303  A detailed overview on Deutsche T elekom’s further initiatives, 
 voluntary agreements and v
arious cooperation programs is 
 presented in our 2008 CR Online Report. 
Youth protection in the virtual world.  In today’s w orld, t he Internet has 
become a central platform for information, communications and enter-tainment – both on the PC at home and on the road via mobile devices. 
Deutsche T elekom acknowledges the independence granted by the 
 Internet and the resulting opportunities for users as a significant part of our everyday lives. However, this unlimited freedom also conceals 
 dangers for children and minors. 
Deutsche T elekom has taken up different approaches for the protection 
of minors in the virtual world. That is because technological changes and the resulting application possibilities call for the constant adaptation of existing instruments. We provide effective mechanisms for protection, classify contents to identify and promote eligible offers on the web, contribute to increasing awareness and combat illegal content on the Internet. 
Effective protection through access control. In its abundance of infor-
mation and offers, the Internet also includes content which ought to be accessed exclusively by adult users so as not to endanger the upbringing and development of children. Even though designing and composing  Internet content are not part of our core business as an ICT service  provider, Deutsche T elekom nonetheless sees it as its duty to provide aid 
and guidance in the safe use of media. 
Since October 2007, we have allocated an important instrument for 
 protecting minors against content not suitable for their age in our T-Online 
Kids Portal. The Magic Desktop software of Norwegian software developers EasyBits is the world’s first operating system designed specifically for 
 children. The software is exclusively available for downloading in the 
 parents’ corner of the Kids Portal. Parents can use Magic Desktop to 
determine the pages and services on the Internet which their children 
may visit and those which ought to be restricted. Magic Desktop has 
proved its worth by bagging first place in the European Commission’s 
“Safer Internet” test. Customers

At the same time in Germany, we have been safeguarding our online offers 
for adults since 2003 with an age verification system (AVS). The system 
ensures that only registered users who can furnish valid age verification 
may have access to restricted content. The German Commission for the 
Protection of Minors from Unsuitable Media Content (KJM) took on the task 
of verifying the system’s efficiency in accordance with the statutory regula-tions and judged it to be positive. For 2008, we intend to upgrade our AVS 
further, even though it currently exceeds the statutory requirements. As 
the number of Internet-compatible cell phones is on the rise, the AVS is to 
be standardized throughout Germany for the mobile and fixed networks. 
One access code will then be valid for both mobile and fixed networks. This way, the system will be rendered more user-friendly and simultaneously 
maintain the high safety standards. 
Raising people’s awareness. The most important preventive measure 
is a dialog of trust with children and young people on media, media 
content and their influence. We look upon it as our task to support parents, 
persons of trust as well as teachers to take their responsibility towards young people  seriously, under the premise of raising the level of conscious-
ness for opportunities and risks involved in using new media and making 
the  participants aware of offers suitable for a particular age group.
T o this effect, Deutsche T elekom and 13 other ICT companies in a joint 
effort with the European Schoolnet (EUN) launched the www.teachtoday.
eu website for teachers and educators in April 2008. According to the 
EU Commission, nine out of ten students in the age group of 12 to 14 own 
a cell phone and over 65 percent of the schools in Europe have a high-speed 
Internet connection. It is therefore essential that a critical discussion on the responsible use of ICT s be integrated in daily school routine more 
than ever. However, many teachers still do not possess sufficient media competence to discuss issues with their students, such as bullying via the cell phone, publishing photographs on the Web without consent and the  unreflective handling of personal data.
For this reason, the www.teachtoday.eu homepage offers, apart from 
 extensive information and material, such as a dictionary of online terms, 
complete instructional units meant to assist teachers in encouraging 
a  critical and confident interaction with digital media. We are keen on 
 continuing this project with our partners in the coming year too. 
In summer 2007, T-Mobile UK integrated a separate section, www.t-mobile.
co.uk/adviceforparents, on the company website, presenting extensive 
information on the subject of protection of children and minors. Visitors are 
informed about dealing with incidents of bullying via the cell phone, spam 
and inappropriate content. The contents were developed together with the 
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), Britain’s 
largest non-profit organization committed to protecting children from acts of cruelty, abuse and violence.Appropriate online content. Apart from protecting children and minors from content deemed harmful for their upbringing and development, it 
is also essential to present children and young people other online offers 
as an attractive, entertaining alternative with appropriate content suitable 
for their age. One such alternative is the above-mentioned T-Online Kids 
Portal, existent since July 2004, which includes an extensive content for children and young people between 6 and12. 
Since children’s websites often have little textual content, it is extremely 
 difficult to find them via conventional search engines. T o resolve this, we 
integrated the “Blinde Kuh” search engine, specifically catering to children’s needs on the T-Online Kids Portal. The search engine only shows results 
appropriate for kids and minors and thus plays its part in ensuring that 
 children only visit suitable sites while surfing. With a special checking system 
which encompasses editorial research and verification, “Blinde Kuh” is the 
only search engine in Germany to have bundled access to over 25,000 
websites designed specially for children. 
As one of the founding members, among other companies, Deutsche 
T elekom also supports the German government initiative “One Network 
for Children” which was launched in May 2007, and promotes this joint project of the federal government and industry both financially and by  providing expert know-how. The aim of this initiative is to enhance media competence of children. T o achieve this, the project adopts two approaches: 
–  One important pillar of this project is creating a protected surfing 
zone for c hildren up to 14 years. T o this effect, the children’s website 
www.fragFinn.de was launched in November 2007. This platform provides 
access to approved sites where young Internet users are able to surf 
freely. A team of media educators lists these sites and updates and 
inspects them on a regular basis. Using a toolbar in the browser window, parents and teachers can configure the browser such that it only allows children to surf on approved sites. In this manner, children should learn interacting with the Internet wit hout being subject to its dangers and 
parents can be sure that their little ones are not confronted with inappro-
priate content and images.
–  Financial support for meaningful Internet content for kids constitutes 
the second pillar of “One Network for Children” through which the 
project aims at optimizing the number, quality and detectability of good 
children’s sites on the Internet, thereby also expanding the protected 
surfing zone.

Solutions for customers and the Group.
The impact of the information and communication technology (ICT) industry on the environment and 
climate can be traced back mainly to the high energy consumption of companies and their products. According to the “Smart 2020” study carried out by the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), the ICT industry was responsible for emitting 830 megatons of CO
2 in 2007. This represents around 2 percent 
of global carbon dioxide emissions. Owing to the increasing demand for more and more new services, experts expect the energy needs of the ICT industry to increase further. It is expected to amount to 1.43 gigatons of CO
2 in 2020. At the same time, digital products and solutions will help ICT users 
become a lot more energy efficient in future. The challenge facing us is to sever the link between our unavoidable energy consumption and CO
2 emissions and further increase energy efficiency in all 
our actions. 
Environmental protection in the Group.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report confirmed 
in 2007 that the greenhouse effect caused by human activity is on the increase and global warming is under way. The consequences of rising average temperatures worldwide also make themselves felt when it comes to the increasing cooling needs of our data centers. The fact that we have been working towards a reduction in our CO
2 emissions for years now 
proves to be the right decision. In line with this strategy, we continue to rely 
on the growing energy efficiency of our products and processes and step up the use of renewable energies.
We have already achieved an important milestone. We are the only large 
ICT company to obtain a significant chunk of our electricity needs from 
renewable sources. In Germany we have even achieved 100 percent since 
 January 2008. Thanks to the acquisition of green certificates from the Renewable Energy Certificate System (RECS), our Group subsidiary PASM 
Power and Air Condition Solution Management GmbH & Co. KG (Power & Air Solutions) ensures that the electricity consumed by Deutsche T elekom in Germany is produced from regenerative energy sources elsewhere and 
fed into the European power grid. In addition, we have offset further CO
2 
emissions in 2007 by purchasing and verifiably annulling or suspending certificates of emission reduction (CERs). Selected products like phone cards and  telephones from the Sinus range as well as internal and external events 
hosted by Deutsche T elekom were made climate-neutral in this way. We 
used certificates here to offset a total of 53,417 metric tons of CO
2 in 2007. 1.6

Environmental protection in the Group
Group-wide environmental management system.  ISO 14001 environ-
mental management systems have been the basis for Deutsche T elekom’s 
environmental protection activities for many years. We are currently dealing 
with the question of a Group environmental management system owing 
to increased demand from our customers and internal efficiency require-
ments. We have been developing a concept since January 2008 that  provides first of all for the coordination of the management systems of our 
Group subsidiaries T-Home, T-Mobile and T-Systems. The three business 
areas are to be included by the end of 2009 and a central umbrella certifi-
cate created. We expect Group-wide integration to provide us with more 
transparent environmental data. This will help us uncover further potential for optimization and energy reduction and coordinate our environmental 
protection activities in an even better way.

New technologies for better performance and less energy consump-tion. Network operation is r esponsible f 
or the highest proportion of energy 
consumption at Deutsche T elekom. Even if we now obtain all electrical 
energy in Germany from regenerative sources and have therefore severed 
the link between energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, increasing the 
efficiency of our network technology is a key lever for Deutsche T elekom. 
The amount of data transferred is increasing because more and increas-ingly powerful services are being utilized. The higher amount of energy involved can only be offset by using modern technology. That is why we 
installed innovative, energy-saving systems technology and air-conditioning 
technology at numerous sites in 2007. In addition, the real estate service 
provider Deutsche T elekom Immobilien und Service GmbH (DeT e Immo -
bilien) carried out energy checks at 160 buildings belonging to our real 
estate portfolio in 2007 and initiated steps to improve the thermal energy properties of the buildings. Energy consumption could therefore be reduced by 15,000 MWh in 2007. The focus here is on optimizing the heating  systems. Added to that are efficient construction measures, e.g. improve-
ment of thermal insulation. The energetic renovations being carried out 
on the property portfolio will also be continued in 2008, with reductions 
in energy consumption expected to be of a similar size to those in 2007. 
Innovative systems technology for our mobile communications sites.  
By the end of 2007, T-Mobile had implemented comprehensive measures at 
more than 15,000 German cell sites for renewal of the systems technology in the GSM network (Global System for Mobile Communications). We have therefore created the world’s most modern platform for the mobile communi-cations standard EDGE virtually throughout the country. The advantage of modern systems technology is that it enables high-speed transmission 
of data such as e-mails or images, simultaneously saving approx. 30 per-
cent energy.

Green IT. Deutsche T elekom has been e x clusively using regenerative 
power to operate its network in Germany since January 2008. As the world’s fourth largest provider of data center capacity, this does not relieve us of the responsibility to make the energy usage of our facilities – also in the interests of our customers – increasingly efficient. With Green IT concepts such as 
centralized service platforms and virtual servers, we are continually improv-
ing the efficiency of our data centers.
Parallel to the introduction of multimedia messaging (MMS), we have also 
started to amalgamate our service platforms. T oday, for instance, the voice-
mail services require only two central platforms for the entire T-Mobile group. 
At the beginning of 2008, we integrated additional services – making sure 
at all times that quality does not suffer. By the end of 2010, we intend to 
implement this concept to reduce the energy consumption of our service platforms by 75 percent. 
In mid-2007, we launched another initiative to improve utilization of our 
data centers by initiating server virtualization. By creating an additional level between the system software and underlying hardware, it is possible to sever the link between the service and tangible server at any time without adverse 
effects. This way, we can run several independent services simultaneously on one server and assign its computer performance to those services that 
 currently need it. In the case of low capacity utilization, the servers also 
power down into a kind of energy-saving mode. After the positive experiences gained by our project team in a first case study, we are optimistic that we can reduce the number of servers operated from 1,000 to 200 by 2015. T ogether with intelligent energy management, we will be able to save up to 
3,800 MWh a year. With this amount of energy, all T-Mobile company cars

deepen our know-how of innovative technologies and sustainable energy 
usage, Deutsche T elekom invests regularly in pilot projects. We support energy production from renewable sources. Against the background of  climate change, we see tremendous potential above all in developing 
alternative cooling systems. Modern and environmentally friendly energy 
production facilities form the focal point of further tests such as local 
CHP plants with cogeneration or photo-voltaic systems.

Sustainable air conditioning for data centers.  As a pioneer of new tech-
nology , w
e intend to help environmentally friendly fuel cell technology 
on the road to success. We see numerous areas of application for the use 
of fuel cells in the Deutsche T elekom Group. The rise in temperature of 
between 1.5 and 4.5°C expected by the end of the century as a result of climate change places considerable demands on the cooling and venti-
lation of our systems and data centers. Current restructuring of the ICT 
 network architecture and the introduction of the Next Generation Network 
(NGN) are accompanied by higher power density in the data centers. The 
current consolidation and virtualization trend in the IT environment also contributes to this.28 | 29

tally friendly and above all reliable electricity and heat supply. In the summer 
of 2007, we started operating a high temperature fuel cell system in one of Deutsche T elekom’s largest data centers in Munich. With the help of an absorption cooling system to cool the computer rooms, we also use waste 
heat from the fuel cell to achieve overall system efficiency of approx. 80 per-cent. In addition, the fuel cells are fed with biogas, which is generated from 
 biomass near to the city and therefore ensures a closed CO
2 cycle. Aside 
from its ecological benefits, fuel cell technology also contributes to an even more reliable energy supply of our computers, as the biogas used is a 
 second energy source besides the conventional power grid.
Geothermal energy for cooling and heating.  Renewable energy sources 
are to play a significant role in supplying our facilities and buildings with 
energy in future. Following a promising feasibility study on the use of geo-
thermal energy carried out by Power & Air Solutions together with Freiberg 
T echnical University (TU), we started planning a pilot system in Munich in 2007. We plan to use geothermal heat here to cool our telecommunica-
tions equipment as w ell as heat the offices. The aim of the project, which 
will receive scientific support from TU Freiberg until 2010, is to continue 
to develop concepts for efficient and resource-friendly air-conditioning of Deutsche T elekom’s new NGN.
Involving our employees and customers. For climate and environmental 
protection to be a success, innovative technology always depends on the 
personal involvement of people. Individual achievements in many different 
areas add up to considerable savings if everyone participates.
Deutsche T elekom regularly includes many employees in its environmental 
activities with site-based energy saving initiatives. There was e.g. a two-day 
information event in the T-Mobile head office in Bonn in November 2007 
with the slogan “Climate days – every one of you can make a difference to 
the climate.” The focus of the event was on environmentally responsible 
behavior at the workplace. The employee motivation campaign “E-Fit,” which

Dr. Ignacio Campino, Board Representative for Sustainability and Climate Protection at Deutsche T elekom, met Jos Delbeke in Brussels on May 13, 2008 to discuss the opportunities available to companies and politicians for reducing worldwide CO
2 emissions. Jos Delbeke has been Deputy 
Director-General for the Environment at the Euro-pean Commission since January 2008, and is widely regarded as the driving force behind the Commission’s climate protection package.

DeTeFleet Ser
vices, Deutsche T elekom’s provider of mobility services, is 
also geared to climate protection with its fleet management services and 
therefore contributes at the same time to greater cost efficiency in our fleet. We operate one of the largest fleets that run on natural gas in Germany with 
around 800 such vehicles. Almost half of our diesel vehicles were already fitted with soot filters as of December 31, 2007.
Our vehicle procurement is based on a specially developed ecological key 
indicator system whose requirement clearly exceeds current environmental 
standards. By monitoring fuel consumption and road performance, we  provide our deployment locations and vehicle users with an insight into 
consumption data and therefore give them reasons to choose the most effi-
cient means of transport each time. In addition, we introduced the “Eco 
Car” category for company cars in November 2007. The energy savings 
 initiatives of our fleet management are rounded off by an ecological driver’s 
training on a broad scale. In 2007 alone, more than 1,900 T-Home employ-
ees were trained in ecological driving and almost 190,000 liters of diesel or almost 500 metric tons of CO
2 have thus been saved.

Ignacio CampinoEcology
Environmental protection in the Group
Ignacio Campino: According to a recently pub-
lished McKinsey study commissioned by the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), CO
2 
 emissions in the ICT sector are set to rise to 1.43 gigatons by 2020, which would represent a 
 tripling in volume since 2002. By the same token, however, ICT solutions have the potential to  reduce CO
2 emissions by 7.8 gigatons. But unless 
we take  action, emissions will continue to rise 
and this reduction potential will remain untapped. As a company, we have already taken steps to re-duce our CO
2 emissions. Our aim is to emit 20 per-
cent less CO 2 over the period 1990 to 2020. 
Jos Delbeke: I think we need a two-pronged 
 approach: companies that are willing to take the lead and set themselves reduction targets, as well as specific statutory provisions to ensure that 
these trend-setters are not acting in isolation. We need leaders, but we also need followers. If 
 governments can support the pioneering compa-
nies, they can also motivate others to follow their 
lead. The main challenge facing us is the develop-ment of high-tech solutions.
Ignacio Campino:  We are keen to track the 
 development of new technologies in the energy 
market, because we are interested in how they 
could be applied to certain areas of the company. 
We believe that a decentralized energy supply 
will gain significance in the future. However, we also need to tackle the rising energy prices, as the cost pressure on companies continues to grow.30 | 31

Jos Delbeke: A powerful market-based incentive 
provides engineers and inventors with a good starting position for new developments. We must seize this opportunity with both hands, by promot-ing incentives and rewarding good ideas, rather than dictating everything. This is the objective behind the ETS, the Emission Trading Scheme, which we would like to extend to the entire OECD territory from 2013. If we can achieve a global CO
2 
market among industrialized countries by 2013 and succeed in fully engaging major developing countries after 2020, this would offer very usable prospects for our work. 
Ignacio Campino: What is your message to us, 
both as an industry and as a company? Jos Delbeke: The technological development 
I have in mind extends far beyond your industry. Your company is an important energy saver, thanks to this technology. More than that, how-ever, Deutsche T elekom’s products also offer Mobile communications and health.  Controversial discussions in public 
on the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) emitted by IT devices have 
raged for years. Deutsche T elekom does not only assign top priority to the 
safety and environmental sustainability of its products and technologies, but is also very much committed in the long term to informing the public 
and promoting research. 
Deutsche T elekom is convinced that by complying with the prevailing 
 security standards and tolerance limits mobile communications is a safe 
and sure technology. This conviction is based on current findings made 
by independent national and international experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing 
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), which evaluate all relevant studies on a 
 continual basis and investigate security standards. Deutsche T elekom also opts for open and transparent information when it comes to the SAR levels of devices. The WHO stipulates 2 watts per kilogram of body weight here. 
All cell phones sold by T-Mobile comply with this limit, and most are 
clearly below. Wishing to provide the customer with this information prior to any purchase, T-Mobile was the first network operator in Germany in 2004 to print the manufacturers’ details on SAR levels on the T-Mobile 
packaging.
In many national companies, we support initiatives and institutions in order 
to promote the social acceptance of mobile communications – for example the Mobile Operators Association (MOA) in Great Britain, the Forum Mobil-
funkkommunikation (FMK) in Austria and the Informations zentrum Mobilfunk 
(IZMF) in Germany. These institutions provide different information and 
 dialog forums on various aspects of mobile communications.

 society an opportunity to reduce its CO 2 emis-
sions at a level far beyond that which you your-
selves incur. The message here should be that high-tech pays off, especially in your technology-intensive industry. As far as your company is  concerned, Deutsche T elekom has proven itself to be an innovator.
Ignacio Campino:  Do you believe that our strategy 
for severing the link between CO
2 emissions and 
energy consumption is on the right track? Jos Delbeke: Yes I do. This strategy is still very 
much in its infancy, and we need to await further developments. It takes time to invent new con-
cepts and translate these innovations into usable 
products and services. However, one or two 
 decades offer enormous potential for change. 
Looking back at the cars, houses, computers and services in 1980, it was a completely different 
world back then. 
32_DTAG_CSR_2008_EN   3232_DTAG_CSR_2008_EN   32 09.10.2008   16:25:06 Uhr09.10.2008   16:25:06 UhrIgnacio Campino:  Our task is to harmonize our 
short-term entrepreneurial objectives with the 
global challenges facing us. Sometimes we fail. It sometimes seems to me that we are borrowing against the future.
Jos Delbeke: That’s true. We must consider what 
will happen if the entire Chinese population sets 
out to attain the same level of economic develop-ment we currently enjoy in Europe. Our CO
2 
 footprint is pretty big and will remain so. Even if we succeed in gradually reducing our emissions 
year by year, we will still continue to consume 
large quantities of products and services at a level which is simply unsustainable for the world 
as a whole. Call me pessimistic, but in my eyes 
there is only one solution: We need to crank our 
technological growth up another gear. If we want 
to sustain our current level of development, we are reliant upon outstanding performance in terms of CO
2 efficiency. In your capacity as repre-
sentative of an industrial company, may I ask you 
something? Sustainable products and services. 
Sustainable product responsibility is a complex task in the ICT sector. 
Developing energy efficient products, services and solutions for our 
 customers is very much to the fore here, which should make connected 
work and life easier for customers in future and help them to assume responsibility towards the environment and climate. The “Smart 2020” 
study predicts that the savings potential of 7.3 gigatons associated with 
the use of innovative ICT products will be five times higher than the CO
2 
emissions of the entire ICT industry in 2020. Digitization actually provides diverse opportunities to reduce CO
2 emissions. It helps e.g. avoid travel 
and transportation, cut down on printing paper and optimize energy 
 consumption. By developing sustainable products and services, Deutsche 
T elekom also gets the chance to tap into new customer segments and make itself stand out from competitors. Increased R & D therefore constitutes a key part of our corporate responsi-bility (CR) strategy. With the realignment of our strategy, we set ourselves 
the goal of strengthening the low-carbon society in the long term in 2007 (
 see page 11 f.). A far-sighted ecological and social assessment of the 
impact of ICT technologies and their CO 2 emissions is therefore of great 
importance to us. This must include both the considerable savings potential 
and a possible increase in energy consumption. A potential increase in 
energy requirements cannot be excluded during the transition phase to the 
next generation network (NGN) since more energy will be needed to cope 
with rising amounts of data and to run parallel network infrastructures. 
Ignacio Campino: Of course.
Jos Delbeke: What do you think industry needs? We have negotiated a raft of measures for the 
 Copenhagen agreement: Innovation, technology 
and market incentives. From your point of view as 
a representative of a leading company, is there anything specific you would like to propose and 
implement in Copenhagen in 2009? 
Ignacio Campino:  For us, of course, CO
2 reduc-
tion targets are top of the agenda. We cannot give 
powerful developing economies a blank check 
when it comes to emissions. Another issue close to our hearts is finding ways of encouraging 
 innovation and investment. We know that the 
 financial markets have a keen interest in this 
 sector, but they need clear, stable conditions in 
order to encourage investments in projects and technologies aimed at reducing CO
2 emissions. 
A third point is: we need emissions trading. How can we, as an ICT company, participate? We are 
not the largest emitters, and I am aware that we Ecology

mobile communications network provides the subscribers of an increas-
ingly mobile society with significant social and ecological benefits. Mobile 
Internet services create more freedom for people to organize their lives 
and their work in a flexible and self-determined manner. Up-to-the-minute 
traffic information and specific, location-based cell-phone services make it easier for drivers to bypass traffic jams and find their way in unfamiliar 
surroundings while helping save on fuel and CO
2 emissions. More environ-
mentally sound forms of travel, e.g. by train, become a lot more attractive for our customers with the possibility of almost unlimited access to the 
global knowledge and information society.
Products for digitizing processes. Deutsche T elekom plans to focus on 
developing product solutions that help our customers conserve the environ-ment and resources via systematic digitization. Digitization enables them to replace processes that use lots of energy and materials and therefore opens 
up considerable potential for savings and growth. As part of our sustainable 
product responsibility, we need to utilize this potential and secure it in the long term. T apping the savings potential of teleworking, videoconferences, route optimization, electronic workflow or the digitization of records usually 
means higher energy consumption owing to the increased use of elec-
tronic devices. Finding ways to abate this forms another focal point of our 
development work. There are already lots of good examples of how mobile 
information transfer can be used to make savings on physical transportation and consumption. By using e-mail, mobile Internet, Short and Instant 
 Messaging or wireless sensors, actual movements of goods, persons or 
papers become superfluous for the most part. In some cases, the efficiency 
increase can be supported by figures: For example, T-Systems was able 
to help a German automobile manufacturer save 150 metric tons of paper, 800,000 transport kilometers and 168,000 liters of photo developing 
chemicals a year by setting up electronic workflows and an archive for 
incoming invoices. Digitizing files and records for a German pension fund agency reduced the volume of traffic needed to transport files by 90 percent.

Spotlight: Climate protection
have already achieved a great deal in terms of climate protection. However, we feel that a certain level of political pressure is important for resolv-
ing the occasional conflict between short-term 
and long-term targets. I would also like to explore 
the most favorable conditions for transferring 
our services and potential into other sectors. For example, take the possibility of substituting energy-
intensive processes with ICT solutions. Suitable political framework conditions are vital if we are to make any headway here. There is still a lack of 
insight regarding the potential offered by sub-
stitution, e.g. for business travel. The technical 
capabilities and opportunities are excellent, but someone needs to create the necessary pressure 
to ensure that these are actually utilized.
Jos Delbeke: We firmly believe that we can create 
incentives for substitution via market pressure. If you take a look at our sector approach, you will 
be amazed. T ake transport, for example. We need 
more rail transport instead of air or road trans-
port. This type of substitution is capable of achiev-
ing a great deal.Since 1995, Ignacio Campino has held various management positions in the

Ignacio Campino: I think we have spoken enough about pressure and incentives. For too long, the debate has been conducted along the lines of, 
“Do this, do that!”
Jos Delbeke: The general public and market 
players must be given the freedom to decide for 
themselves about their level of CO

However, we do need to set a clear signal. One 
man’s pressure is another man’s opportunity. 
That’s how an economy works.

to communicate beyond the bounds of countries and continents. They help 
save time, money and not least CO 2 emissions. T elephone conferences are 
now part of everyday life in many offices. Thanks to data conference tech-nology, presentations can also be discussed and worked on over the Internet. 
In addition, videoconferences offer participants the chance to communicate face to face via a screen. These technologies house tremendous potential 
for climate protection. If 30 percent of all business trips worldwide were 
replaced by videoconferences, this would yield savings of 80 million tons of 
CO
2 a year according to the “Smart 2020” study. The increased demand 
among customers in this area illustrates the need for ecologically sensible 
solutions. Between 2006 and 2007, the number of telephone and data 
conferences requested by Deutsche T elekom customers increased by around 
50 percent. 
Since December 2007 T-Systems has been using T elepresence, a brand-new 
videoconference solution developed by Cisco Systems. With real-time 
images and sound, up to twelve participants from different parts of the world can videoconference with each other face to face in a virtual meeting. 
High-definition cameras, realistic depiction on 65" plasma monitors and a 
4-channel sound system provide high-definition video (HD) and HiFi quality speech reproduction. As a Cisco premium partner, T-Systems is responsible for selling and distributing this new solution in Germany. We expect that the product will lend new impetus to the market for videoconferences, above all because it is extremely easy to use.
Climate-neutral fixed-network phones. With its cordless Sinus telephones 
product line, Deutsche T elekom has been the first provider of a complete 
environmentally friendly product range on the terminal device market since fall 2007. A feature of all products from the Sinus range is extremely low energy consumption. The switched-mode power supply alone accounts for a 30 to 60 percent power saving compared with conventional transformer 
units. Besides, the transmission power of the base unit and the handset 
has been reduced and adapted to modern needs. Another special feature 
of the joint project involving our Sustainable Design unit and the Customer Premises Equipment Center is that users of the new Sinus phone can now 
make climate-neutral calls. Deutsche T elekom has offset the emissions arising from energy consumption over the phone’s average useful life of five years by purchasing emission reduction certificates for 53,100 metric tons of CO
2. 
In turn, it supports climate-friendly projects from the CO 2 emissions trade 
project “Hesse-T ender,” among them innovative energy production plants 
with a measurable CO 2 savings effect. We sold around 400,000 Sinus tele-
phones between October 2007 and March 2008. Healthy sales of this new 
series bearing the “climate-neutral” label attest to this product concept. Taking back and recycling cell phones. Over the entire life cycle of our 
products, services and solutions, we attach considerable importance to 
 following sustainable criteria; this also includes taking back used telephones 
and cell phones as well as reusing, recycling or disposing of them. Of 
course, reuse comes first, with disposal the last option. 
All national companies of the T-Mobile group offer to take back and recycle 
the valuable materials of cell phones. There is considerable potential for 
the reuse of cell phones. Network coverage would make it possible for 
around 80 percent of the world’s population to make mobile calls, yet only 
20 percent – in Africa it’s even less than 5 percent – actually use mobile communications. Reintroducing used, but functioning cell phones to the 
market via our business partners in e.g. south-east Asia or Africa extends 
their lifespan and aids economic development. Thus we are able to ensure reuse of around 60 percent of the cell phones returned. The other devices are recycled professionally. Automobile suppliers for example use plastic 
cases to manufacture interior trims for vehicles. Valuable components like 
precious metals are extracted and reused; the harmful substances that remain are disposed of in a sustainable way. 
T aking back used cell phones for free has been one of T-Mobile’s voluntary 
services since the year 2003. Our system goes beyond what is required by law with this voluntary commitment. There are special postage bags available in all T elekom Shops and at T-Mobile partners as well as on the 
Internet at www.t-mobile.de/unternehmen/umwelt which you can use to post old cell phones, batteries and chargers free of charge to our recycling 
partners. We took back more than 100,000 cell phones in Germany for 
the first time in 2007. A large part of this was the result of several effective 
campaigns in which we were able to spur numerous customers and inter-ested parties to join in.

In May 2007, Corporate Procurement adopted a Group strategy on sus-
tainable procurement and integrated it in its procurement policies and 
processes. Ensuring compliance with minimum social and ecological 
standards along the entire value chain is therefore now one of Deutsche 
T elekom’s strategic corporate goals. Observing international standards, national legislation, fair conditions of work, regular employee training and 
consistent product end-of-life management are just some of the criteria that are binding for all suppliers and that play a role during Deutsche T elekom’s buying decisions. The Deutsche T elekom Code of Conduct and our fraud 
policy for fighting corruption are also applied throughout our procurement 
activities.
One vital element of our sustainable procurement strategy is to obligate 
our suppliers to guarantee compliance with the standards of the Social 
Charter adopted in 2003, which lays down binding Group rules on human 
rights, equal opportunities, occupational health and safety as well as the 
right to set up and join a trade union. The Social Charter is based on the values of the Global Compact as well as on the conventions of the Inter-national Labor Organization (ILO) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In addition to this, we oblige our suppliers to ensure that their suppliers, in turn, also operate according to these rules. In 2007 Deutsche T elekom informed all its suppliers that compliance with social and ecological standards is now a compulsory element of its contractual relationships.
Group-wide steering committee. With the establishment of the Sustainable 
Procurement Working Group (SPWG) in September 2007, we set up a central steering committee for sustainable procurement in our company. Members of SPWG come from CR, which coordinates environmental protection and sustainability issues throughout the Group, from Group Procurement and from the procurement departments in the Group units at T-Home, T-Systems and T-Mobile. This committee of experts works on 
developing effective and market-compatible solutions for Group-wide 
procurement that satisfy sustainability criteria. In doing so, they also consult 
external experts and stakeholders. SPWG bears responsibility for publicizing 
the defined social and ecological criteria among Procurement staff and In 2007, Deutsche T elekom’s procurement volume was EUR 19.7 billion. We purchased goods and services from 77 supplier countries all over the globe. Many of our suppliers own manufacturing facilities in emerging and developing countries, predominantly in south-east Asia, or procure goods from this source.
Global procurement offers Deutsche T elekom vast business opportunities but does so at the risk that 
our suppliers may not be observing minimum social and ecological standards. This goes hand in hand with the risk of losing reputation and business. On the other hand, Deutsche T elekom’s substantial procurement volume gives it major influence over the manufacturing conditions in the facilities run by its suppliers and sub-suppliers. We intend to assume a world-leading role in the area of corporate responsibility (CR) and are taking this opportunity to make our impact. For us, this also means demon-strating our responsibility along the entire value chain – and thus also for our supplier firms. We are committed to achieving fair conditions of work and high quality standards in our suppliers’ facilities in our efforts to ensure that our customers are satisfied over the long term. We systematically manage the specific opportunities and risks inherent in the broad supplier and sub-supplier network by deploying a sustainable supply chain management system throughout the Group.Suppliers.

 Listen, discuss and understand – the first 
Stakeholder Day in this form was designed 
to support open and transparent communi-
cation with all stakeholders. In future, the event 
will offer changing content and provide the plat-form for doing so on an annual basis. The subject 
of this first dialog session was sustainable pro-
curement as a global challenge, an area in which we rely on the support and cooperation of our 
stakeholders, and in particular of our suppliers. 
It is, of course, also an area in which concerted efforts offer major potential for a positive influ-ence in the interests of a sustainable society. 
Just how diverse the sustainable procurement 
issue actually is was reflected in the broad range 
of different suggestions that were put forward in 
the course of the day: suppliers, analysts and 
employees as well as representatives from NGOs and universities took the opportunity to present their visions of a responsible value chain and to critically examine the sustainable procurement 
strategy we presented for Deutsche T elekom. Deutsche T elekom’s Stakeholder Day on sustainable procure-ment had its premiere on April 2, 2008. Over 40 representatives from five stakeholder groups followed our invitation to attend the meeting at Deutsche T elekom Headquarters in Bonn. 
“Deutsche T elekom’s Stakeholder Day was a first 
impressive step toward addressing climate-relevant 
issues in the value chain. We would welcome it if 
Deutsche T elekom would extend its collaboration with 
its suppliers and join the CDP Supply Chain Program 
so that it can share its best-practice know-how with 
other companies across the entire ICT industry.”
Frances Way, Supply Chain Program Manager, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)“Innovation and new technologies have a major impact 
on the environment and its future positive development. Most importantly, we see cooperation with our customers on the further development and implementation of new technologies, like for example with Deutsche T elekom, as offering major potential for strengthening our joint positive contribution towards sustainability.”
Dirk Wettig, Account Manager, Cisco Systems, Inc. During the one-day event, a broad range of differ-
ent positions were communicated and explained 
to all participants as well as to smaller working 
groups. In the morning, for example, discussions focused on general sustainable procurement issues at Deutsche T elekom. Where are the core 
issues and where the limitations of responsibility 
for the value chain? What topics will Deutsche T elekom need to give top priority in the future? 
Many arguments were exchanged until finally a 
clear requirements profile emerged. Deutsche T elekom needs to spotlight three topic areas in its work towards a responsible value chain: energy 
efficiency, conditions of work and waste/disposal management. Unity also reigned on another con-
cern: how far Deutsche T elekom’s responsibility 
for this value chain goes is not restricted to 
the company’s own sphere of influence. Public discussion on environmental standards and con ditions of work all over the globe is another 38 | 39

factor that commits Deutsche T elekom to ex-
tending its responsibilities to encompass all its 
suppliers and sub-suppliers.
The working groups met again for the afternoon 
session. This time, they submitted their concrete expectations of what the company should do. The suppliers held the view that costs and benefit should be distributed fairly across all the parties 
involved in the development and sale of sus-
tainable products. The NGOs called on Deutsche 
T elekom and its suppliers to share their best-
practice know-how. In addition, they emphasized 
that suppliers could also profit from compliance 
with Deutsche T elekom’s sustainability standards, since these would make them more competitive. 
Their view was that Deutsche T elekom’s volun-
tary commitment, although praiseworthy, does 
not go far enough. In “sensitive” supplier coun-
tries, where environmental and social standards remain at a low level, the company should insist 
more strongly on the introduction of state regula-
tions to raise these standards.
At the end of the first Stakeholder Day, partici-
pants reviewed the day’s discussions. In doing 
so, the attending stakeholder groups sent a clear signal to Deutsche T elekom. In their view, the goal 
has to be to play a pioneering role in this sector of industry. Seen overall, Deutsche T elekom should 
“Deutsche T elekom’s responsibility also embraces its 
suppliers, for example those who manufacture cell phones. These phones contain raw materials that are often mined under problematic conditions in developing countries. Deutsche T elekom should join forces with its direct suppliers to establish better social and ecological conditions through-out the supply chain, right through to extraction of raw materials. Joint initiatives like the ones in GeSI can be a vital step in this direction.”
Cornelia Heydenreich, Senior Advisor for Corporate Responsibility, Germanwatch “Deutsche T elekom is one of the companies that do not 
keep their eyes closed to these problems but are already 
demonstrating commitment in various ways, also at 
inter national level. Even so, Deutsche T elekom can still 
do a lot more than its previous, scattered activities if it is to 
become a new industry leader in this area. It goes without 
saying, though, that voluntary measures in the direction 
of sustainability are no substitute for strict compliance 
with current legislation but simply an addition to them.”
Andreas Manhart, Consultant, Öko-Institut e.V.“Cooperation with Deutsche T elekom has proved to be highly beneficial for our company and the ICT industry overall, since it focuses on joint needs. This makes it possible for us to develop solutions that address the most urgent needs of our industry and society as a whole, by joining to work on improving the environmental and social aspects within a common sustainable development framework.”
Peter H. Hellmonds, Corporate Affairs, Nokia Siemens Networks 
therefore apply itself to swift and purposeful 
further development of its sustainable procure-
ment strategy. At the same time, they agreed that, 
with its measures and strategies for sustainable 
procurement, Deutsche T elekom is already in a very good position. However, discussions also 
touched on current improvement potential in 
product innovation, external communication and 
stronger integration of all business partners. This 
is desirable first and foremost because Deutsche 
T elekom’s products and services give the com-
pany the chance to influence other sectors of industry so that these, in turn, make their own 
businesses more sustainable.
Deutsche T elekom will be reviewing the results 
of the event in detail in order to design the steps it needs to take if it is to largely fulfill the expec-
tations of its stakeholders for the sustainable procurement process.

ongoing basis. However, the responsibility for collaboration with suppliers remains with the Procurement department. SPWG is also the central point of contact for all issues and problems relating to sustainable procurement.
Another of SPWG’s key tasks is to convey a deeper understanding of the 
importance of sustainable purchasing decisions to Procurement staff. T o 
support these efforts, an online training tool on entrepreneurial responsibility 
and sustainability has been developed for Procurement, and went into 
service in May 2008.
In order to measure the progress of implementation of the sustainable 
procurement strategy throughout the Group, SPWG has developed its own 
key performance indicators (KPIs). The areas focused on by the working 
group include feedback from dialog sessions with relevant stakeholders 
and the current requirements for universal sustainability rankings.
Ongoing exchange.
One part of Deutsche T elekom’s sustainable procurement strategy consists 
of a continual standardized check on compliance with the social and 
ecological standards defined within our supply chain management system. We call this process, which comprises risk analysis for our suppliers and 
regular on-site audits, the “Social Audit”; this, again, is the responsibility of SPWG. In our Social Audit we opt for cooperation and an ongoing construc-tive dialog, which is characterized by respect and mutual trust.
Before Deutsche T elekom contracts strategically relevant suppliers, SPWG 
subjects them to an upfront review and systematically rates the risks involved 
in cooperating with them. In a second step, selected suppliers are asked 
to state their social and ecological conditions in a detailed questionnaire. 
We record the facts they disclose in a special online information system, 
the Electronics-T ool for Accountable Supply Chain (E-TASC). The system 
has been available to the Group since August 2007 and will help us to assess the sustainability performance of our suppliers quickly and uniformly in 
future, and to identify any risk potential at an early stage. Deutsche T elekom 
developed the tool in collaboration with other members of the information 
and communication technology industry association (ICT) within the frame-
work of the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). By establishing joint standards, we are making our contribution towards sustainable procure-
ment throughout our branch of industry. Deutsche T elekom launches the dialog whenever major infringements of 
minimum social and ecological standards are identified during risk assess-ment. The objective is to cooperate on finding solutions. A standardized escalation process is initiated for suppliers who refuse to submit a self-assessment or to launch an effective improvement process. If agreement cannot be reached, the cooperation may have to be terminated immediately. However, up to the end of 2007 no such action had been taken. One of the key reasons for this is that Deutsche T elekom takes a proactive stance on suppliers with an elevated risk profile and joins with them in personal discussions and audits to draw up action plans that will improve their eco-logical and social standards.Suppliers

Deutsche T elekom had already requested self-assessments from 40 of its 
key suppliers via E-TASC, and our Hungarian subsidiary Magyar T elekom 
had sent another 20 requests out to its TOP suppliers. In this way, we were 
able to cover around 55 percent of our total procurement volume. By the 
end of 2008, we plan to have interviewed all our TOP 100 suppliers and thus have reviewed around 62 percent of our total procurement volume. 
Following introduction of the E-TASC system to all processes within sus-
tainable procurement, we will be adding a performance indicator to the facts 
and figures of our 2009 CR Report that shows how many of our suppliers 
have actually had their performance in the areas of ecology and social standards checked.
We make a point of performing several proactive supplier audits each year. 
In 2007, we evaluated a total of three key suppliers in China and their suppliers in audits that lasted several days. With the support of SPWG, the sustainability experts at Deutsche T elekom interviewed company managers, 
specialist departments and employees on the work and environmental conditions in the company and performed extensive inspections of their 
entire premises. Despite the satisfactory overall impression made by 
the production facilities, the audit revealed several serious deficiencies in the areas of environmental protection and industrial safety. For example, employees had not been suitably informed on their right to set up and join a trade union, the volume of work was excessively high and pay not suitable for the work they were doing. Environmental training was only held at irregular intervals and the living standards in the accommodation pro-
vided for them needed improvement. Deutsche T elekom also provided 
major support during the suppliers’ subsequent development process. 
For example, the inspectors drew up an individual catalog of measures for each of the companies audited and set a deadline by which they had to be implemented. In this way, most of the deficiencies had been successfully eliminated and given a positive rating by the end of 2007. In one supplier 
company, for example, the pay was increased and living conditions in the 
accommodation provided for them subjected to major improvements. In 
others, emergency exits were labeled clearly and regular training programs launched on environmental protection, industrial safety and accident 
prevention. All audit reports were forwarded by SPWG to Procurement for information purposes.

The table on page 43 gives a simplified view of weak points that were 
identified among our suppliers during the 2007audits.
 See page 43.Supplier workshops. Within the frame w ork of supplier development 
activities, SPWG also organizes regular workshops with the top strategic 
suppliers. In 2007, Deutsche T elekom held two workshops with suppliers 
from the field of mobile communications and computers. Here, the different 
aspects and criteria for our sustainable procurement strategy were 
presented and compared with the standards of our suppliers; finally, joint standards for future collaboration were developed. It was also arranged 
that joint audits would be held in the future.
 502
Networking at international level on compliance with human rights.
Deutsche T elekom takes an active part in numerous national and inter-
national initiatives in order to further promote compliance with human 
rights and social and environmental standards in emerging and developing 
countries. As a member and pioneer of GeSI, Deutsche T elekom cooperates with partners from the industry as well as with representatives from non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) to support the development of sustain-
able technologies in the communications industry. This overall branch strategy enables us to achieve maximum impact when solving industry-specific problems.
In recent years, the boom in the electronics industry has triggered a vast 
increase in the demand for such metals as copper, iron, gold, aluminum, 
palladium and cobalt. A study published in 2007 by the “makeITfair” 
campaign reports that many of these metals are mined under extremely 
problematic conditions in developing countries or conflict zones.
The problems involved in obtaining raw materials are assuming an important 
role in GeSI activities. In order to exert influence on manufacturing condi-
tions, it is vital to take a cross-industry approach. This is understandable, 
since brand manufacturers do not come into direct contact with the raw 
material traders, most of whom supply to Asian markets. T o investigate these issues more closely, GeSI cooperated with the Electronic Industry 
Citizenship Coalition (EICC) to commission a comprehensive study, which is due for publication in mid 2008. It analyzes the mining conditions and the impact these have on people and the environment, and includes the 
roles played by the electronics industry and local governments. In January 
2008, Deutsche T elekom joined with other business organizations and 
NGOs to discuss the possibilities of a joint approach at an international roundtable meeting held in Brussels. Following this, the initiators of the 
“makeITfair” campaign drew up a list of principles that must be observed 
when handling raw materials. In the future, Deutsche T elekom will require 
its strategically important suppliers to sign a voluntary commitment to these 
principles. Greater efforts will subsequently be made to check on their compliance, above all on the criteria that correspond to the key values of 
our Social Charter.

Bringing about change to tap diverse opportunities.
Competitive workforce. 
At national as well as international level, Deutsche T elekom is gearing its 
human resources structure to the dynamic change and strong competitive 
pressure in the telecommunications industry. In order to create sustainable 
jobs and competitive employment structures, Deutsche T elekom faces 
the dilemma of how to reconcile the need to reduce personnel costs and improve the quality of its customer centricity with its responsibility for all our employees. 
Sustainable agreement at Telekom Service.  The new collective agree-
ments reached on June 29, 2007 after lengthy bargaining are valid for 
around 50,000 Deutsche T elekom employees. They govern the transfer of employees from call centers, T echnical Customer Service and Network 
Infrastructure Production and Operation to three new service companies. The settlements are also based on terms that are more in line with those in the market as a whole. Negotiations with the trade unions were accom-
panied by warning strikes. Following a ballot, members later voted for 
a series of strikes and walkouts beginning on May 11, 2007. The number 
of working days lost as a result of these strikes totaled some 500,000.The well balanced agreements provide a scenario that enables Deutsche T elekom to reduce its costs and, at the same time, significantly improve 
its customer service as well as productivity and its competitive standing. 
It offers a series of protective measures for employees, including compen-
sation and installment payments, an extended promise to refrain from com-
pulsory dismissals until the end of 2012, and spin-off protection up until 
the end of 2010. The collective agreement, including a related pay freeze at Deutsche T elekom until the end of 2008, saved the Group more than EUR 160 million in the year 2007. From 2010 onwards, Deutsche T elekom anticipates achieving annual savings in excess of EUR 700 million.
As well as protecting existing jobs, Deutsche T elekom’s new employment 
conditions and entry-level salaries that are more in line with the market will 
allow the company to commit to taking on around 4,000 internally trained 
junior staff by 2009. We also recruited another 1,500 new employees in 2007, a figure we were able to match again in the first quarter of 2008. 
The new recruits will reinforce the service workforce and help to secure 
future-oriented skills, qualifications and know-how for the Group. Most of 
them are graduates in a variety of technical and scientific subjects, as well 
as internally trained, sales-oriented junior staff.
 601  
 See 2007 Human Resources Report. Like the entire ICT industry, Deutsche T elekom is undergoing a massive transformation process, mainly driven by changing and escalating customer expectations, global competition, state regulation, still a major feature above all in Germany’s domestic market, and technical innovation. A transformation is also imminent within society itself.
With its four strategic thrusts “Competitive workforce,” “T alent agenda,” “Service culture” and “HR@2009,” 
the HR strategy is geared to Group strategy (
  see page 6) and thus has an important role to play in 
keeping the Group competitive. At the same time, its aim is to offer the company’s workforce of over 240,000 employees worldwide an attractive working environment with diverse opportunities for advanced training and development, and also to reinforce the service culture among its employees.
In a world that is heading for internationalization, encouraging personal and cultural diversity in our 
workforce is one of our concerns.

Adjustments at home and abroad. In 2007, a total of around 14,400 people 
left Deutsche T elekom employment in Germany. This was achieved via a raft 
of measures such as severance pay offers, part-time work for employees 
approaching retirement age, and early retirement schemes such as the 
“55 model” introduced in July 2007, together with natural fluctuation and 
deconsolidation. There have also been headcount changes in Deutsche T elekom’s international units. 
 See 2007 Annual Report. 
New employment prospects through Vivento. Vivento, our human resour
ces service provider and Germany’s most successful transfer agency, 
made an invaluable contribution to vital Group personnel restructuring 
in 2007, in the form of long-term placement management and continuing 
optimization and deconsolidation of business models.
In addition to its deconsolidation of business models in 2007, Vivento also 
concentrated on creating external job opportunities for Deutsche T elekom 
employees. This focused on employment prospects in the public sector, which are primarily offered to civil servants in the Deutsche T elekom Group. 
In total, Vivento acquired some 4,900 public service positions in 2007 and 
posted them on Deutsche T elekom’s job exchange. In total, some 5,000 employees left Vivento in 2007 to explore new prospects. Parallel to this, around 1,700 employees joined Vivento from the Group.
Total workforce management. One of the aims of the HR mission “Your 
Partner in Business” is to optimize the deployment of in-house and external 
personnel resources, minimize personnel cost, and control demographic 
structures and skills. T o this end, we are implementing a total workforce 
management (TWM) system within the Group. The dimensions of TWM range from Group-wide cost transparency based on systematic data colla-tion to the quantitative and qualitative control of all labor costs and skills in line with business development, and through to coordination with the 
employee representatives and communication with the workforce.
Vivento also plays a key role in total workforce management. Based on 
the experiences of our personnel service provider, a capacity management 
scheme is currently under development in Germany to facilitate workforce restructuring. This scheme is dedicated to the development of new employ-ment models and the acquisition of suitable public service positions. 
Vivento supports the business areas through every phase of the restructuring 
process, beginning with the planning stage.Fit for the future. By setting up universal standards and guidelines on 
occupational health and safety throughout the Group, we embedded this 
key topic even more firmly in our company and management structures 
in 2007. Our main objectives are to guarantee full compliance with current 
legislation, statutes and standards, and to optimize our deployment of 
resources. At the same time, we intend to improve health and accident figures, and reduce the number of sick days. In 2007 we succeeded in 
making initial progress with the Group’s health rate.

T alent agenda. 
The availability of highly qualified personnel is the fundamental prerequisite for development of customer-centric products, solutions and services and 
thus for Deutsche T elekom’s business success, today and in the future. 
In view of the growing shortage of expert staff and the global race for talent, 
a central challenge facing the Group’s Human Resources Development unit is how to secure a sustainable skills base. In concrete terms, this means 
backing talented junior staff and offering suitable job prospects to expe-
rienced expert and executive staff. In its efforts on this score, Deutsche T elekom has opted to install a comprehensive talent and performance management system. Its backing for international exchanges and global best-practice sharing is another step that helps to make the Group fit to face the requirements of a globalized market.
Advancement at all levels. In order to win, develop and retain vital expertise 
for the company, we are driving the development of our skills base in two 
ways: by systematically building up skills and competencies throughout the company and by backing career and development prospects for out-standing experts and executive staff. Based on harmonized, performance-related tools and processes, our HR development programs ensure that 
we can identify internal talents early on and guide them toward new respon-
sibilities.46 | 47

and have given them individual backing through our “STEP up!” program 
(Systematic & Transparent Executive Development Program). We use it to 
make new appointments and appoint successors to management positions 
at international level. Our universal assessment scheme, the “Performance 
und Potential Review,” gives us a precise picture across borders of where our executives stand and what prospects they have for development within 
the Group. In 2007, 95 percent of management staff underwent this review, 
well up on 91-percent participation in 2006. “STEP up!” can thus be con-
sidered firmly established throughout the entire Group in 2008, the second 
year since its introduction.
At their end, our management staff is responsible for providing colleagues 
with unambiguous feedback on their performance and potential, and for developing their abilities with specific targets in mind.
With “Go Ahead!”, Deutsche T elekom additionally systematizes and supports 
the development of experts at national as well as international level. Development focuses on the skills and competencies required to handle 
expert tasks. A best-practice approach is based on the “CAMPUS” pro-
grams already in place at T-Systems. “Go Ahead!” offers high-performing and high-potential employees with outstanding expertise an alternative to a management career. The aim is to develop the know-how that is crucial to success inside the company and to keep it there over the long term.

Sustainable training.  With trainees numbering around 12,000, Deutsc he 
T
elekom has been Germany’s biggest training provider for many years. 
Our training ratio of 8 percent is far above the industry average, a level that 
we plan to maintain in the future. In 2007, we reached an agreement with the services industry trade union ver.di that covered another 4,000 trainee 
places for the year and an above-average rate during the period 2008 
to 2010. This annual rate is 2.9 percent of the headcount for permanent 
employees in Germany. Deutsche T elekom also has an important role to play in many other countries as a training provider.
However, our enterprise is not only best-in-class when it comes to quantity. 
Each year, our trainees achieve a top-quality performance with excellent 
exam results, producing Chamber of Commerce prize winners at regional 
level and some of the nation’s top achievers. One way in which we secure 
top quality is through deployment of an EFQM-compliant (European Foun-dation for Quality Management) quality management system, tailored to 
Group needs. Service culture.
Fostering enhanced service awareness and top service competency are 
integral components of our initial and advanced training courses. Deutsche 
T elekom also backs the implementation of a service culture in its team 
development, organizational structures and pay policy, gearing business skills and processes to the wishes and needs of our customers. In the 
same way that DNA determines the basic makeup of living cells, clear 
service orientation – which we call “Service DNA” – will be the underlying 
factor that motivates employees throughout the Deutsche T elekom Group 
and provides them with concrete guidance in their day-to-day work.
Paving the way to service competency.  Even our training offers concentrate 
on the areas of service, sales and IT. With this emphasis, our training 
activities reflect the Deutsche T elekom Group’s focus on service centricity and on close relationships with our customers.
Backing for a service culture also has a major impact in other areas of 
Deutsche T elekom’s personnel work. For example, as defined in the collec-
tive agreement of summer 2007, staff in the three service companies are 
entitled to three days of training each year – irrespective of their individual functions and weekly working hours. In this context, emphasis is placed on refining customer and service centricity, conveying product and service know-how, and training staff to take down departmental barriers in their thoughts and actions. Over and beyond the opportunities for employee fur-ther development, high performers are offered new development and 
career openings (“service careers”).
Service culture projects. We are supporting the establishment of a ser-
vice culture throughout the Group in a broad range of projects. One central project was the founding of Deutsche T elekom’s Service Academy at the end of 2007. Here, our managers obtain an even better insight into what customers really want and into the conditions for staff involved in cus-tomer-facing activities. Attendance at Service Academy workshops, team events and practical phases with direct customer contact is obligatory for all the company’s 2,500 senior executives in Germany. This can be com-pared at international level with the Retail Certification Program currently being implemented by our subsidiaries T-Mobile UK, T-Mobile Croatia and T-Mobile CZ. Other companies will soon follow suit.

Diversity.
Living diversity – Naturally different. 
What does diversity mean for Deutsche 
Telekom?
Thomas Sattelberger: Our top priority is the 
satisf action of our cust
omers. A healthy diver-
sity culture is a strong competitive factor. First, because we can only supply top-class service 
to our customers if all employees pull their 
weight and deploy all their different abilities to 
reach this goal. T o do this, they must be sure 
that differences will not be ignored or even opposed but that they are highly valued. They 
must be able to take for granted that we want 
diversity in our company. Second: in the mid 
term, diversity will be a critical factor in suc-
cessful talent recruiting. We want to get the best – and we must find them in all parts of the 
population and inspire them to work for us. 
Third, a workforce that is just as diverse as our customers are helps us to tailor our products and services better to customer needs and to 
drive innovation. Ideally, all our employees are 
aware of the economic importance of diversity and act accordingly – we still have a long way 
to go on this score.
Apart from this, respect for diversity is a human 
right and an ethical attitude that applies be-yond the bounds of business management.Maud Pagel: For Deutsche T elekom diversity means accepting and promoting individuality 
and pluralism among our workforce – and  to 
do so irrespective of gender, age, disability, ethnic origin, religious beliefs and sexual 
orientation. We also want to do more to sup-
port our employees’ work-life balance so that 
they can live their lives as they see fit. Since 
2004 we have had our own diversity policy, 
which applies as a binding basis in all the 
national companies throughout the Group. The Group Diversity Management team over-
sees implementation in the Group units, with 
international units naturally taking their coun-
try’s legal and cultural scenarios into account. 
Outside the company, we are committed to work in networks and initiatives on the sub-
ject of diversity. Our own diversity reporting, 
a homepage on the intranet and our Annual 
Diversity Report document this work for our employees.
Maud Pagel Thomas SattelbergerAs an international corporate 
group, Deutsche T elekom unites different company cultures under one roof. Its numerous different sites, markets and customer interests mean more challenges that face the com-pany. T o face up to these and to tap the full potential that is generated from diversity in the Group in the interests of business success, Deutsche T elekom has made the subject of Diversity a top management issue. 48 | 49

Thomas Sattelberger, Chief Human 
Resources Officer (CHRO) and Labor 
Dir
ector at Deutsche Telekom since 
May 2007, has set himself the goal of 
driving efforts to establish a diversity 
culture throughout the Group.
What scenario must Deutsche Telekom estab-lish for diversity t o pla 
y a role in the Group’s 
success? 
Thomas Sattelberger: In order to benefit from  
div
ersity as a success factor, we must approach 
the issue systematically at national as well as 
international level. We must therefore gear our 
activities even more closely to internal processes 
and to the needs and conditions in the individual 
business areas. For me, this means on the one 
hand that we must achieve a much closer mesh 
between staff development processes and diver-sity. Second, diversity must be conveyed as a 
business case to and acknowledged by all 
management staff. At the end of the day, it is vital 
to acknowledge the right conduct and, at the 
same time, to address bad behavior and sanction it accordingly. Only when we implement these 
three principles will we be able to tap more of the potential that diversity has to offer. 
Maud Pagel: The primary goal in my view is to 
create a corporate culture throughout the Group 
that is characterized by mutual respect and esteem. This corporate culture is already in place 
in many units but there is still a lot to do before it 
is accepted as a matter of course throughout the 
Group. This is an important task for our manage-
ment staff, since they are the motivators for employee and customer satisfaction.
Where can we see diversity management in the 
compan y’s day -t
o-day business?
Maud Pagel: L et me illustrat e t his with some 
examples. We have various different projects 
running in our national companies and I will 
only mention a few of them here: T-Systems and 
T-Mobile Austria offer an exemplary, broad-based 
child-care service with 100 day-care places 
at their joint headquarters in Vienna. T-Systems South Africa focuses on supporting people who 
are historically disadvantaged: with its CIDA-ICT Academy, the company makes it possible for 
poor students – around 50 percent of them women – to get a high-quality education and, in doing so, works to counter South Africa’s imminent shortage of ICT experts. In Germany, we raise our employees’ awareness for diversity even at the training stage. As an example, 116 trainees attended the “Values day” in Dort-mund in 2007 and gained an insight into the different cultures of their trainee colleagues. We also support staff efforts to harmonize the lifestyles they choose with their work. It is an ambitious aim – we are only too aware of this. As well as flexible work-time models, our offers 
in this field include child care, an area in which 
the Group invested over EUR 1.5 million in Ger-many in 2007. Some of the money was channeled 
into day-care facilities for children at the com-
pany’s big sites in Bonn, Darmstadt and Munich and will soon also be going to a new facility in Stuttgart. We also provide assistance when 
employees have family members who require 
care or have problems with children approaching adolescence. 8 percent of our employees suffer 
from a severe disability. We configure barrier-free workplaces for them in line with their individual needs.
Thomas Sattelberger: Our activities show clearly 
that diversity can become an integral part of 
corporate culture. Our internal and external 
awards also help to fix its importance even more 
firmly in the minds of our employees. We confer an internal diversity award on a two-yearly basis 
as a tribute to outstanding commitment to cultural 
and personal diversity. In 2007, our subsidiary 
Magyar T elekom won first prize for an entire 
diversity project package. Submissions from 
Hungary, South Africa, Slovakia, Austria and Ger-
many reflect the growing internationalization of our diversity competition.In February 2008, a Deutsche T elekom employee won Germany’s “T op father of the year” award. He and his partner have benefited from flexible work-time models to achieve an optimal balance between their management positions and family life with care of their children. Germany’s Minister for Family Affairs, Ursula von der Leyen, congratu-lated the prizewinner in person. These prizes go to show that diversity can be practiced in day-to-day company activities and also that it pays. They are therefore a vital signal for all employees and executive staff to take active steps to follow the prizewinners’ examples. 
What will the focus areas of your work be 
in futur e?
Maud Pagel:  In the future, w e will need t
 o work 
more specifically with facilitators to spread the word about work at Diversity inside and outside the company. T o do this, we plan to launch a 
broadly based communication campaign. Com-
prehensive diversity management gives us a vital opportunity to position ourselves as an attractive 
employer, for instance for trained expert staff with an immigrant background.
In 2008, we will be focusing – initially in Ger-
many – on the subject of work-life balance, which 
includes how we reconcile work with family life. Our employees must perform excellently in a 
tough competitive arena and also have the 
chance to live their private lives as they wish. It is 
up to the Group to give suitable help and to find 
new ways of making this possible.
Thomas Sattelberger: There are another three 
focus areas which we must tackle or press ahead 
with activities in 2008. First of all, we need to 
optimize the way we approach our customers 
and bring our staffing and services into line 
with social reality. At the start of 2008, two pilot projects were launched within T-Punkt Vertriebs-
gesellschaft in Germany. We expect to have the 
first results and empirical data this summer.

employee survey on strategic topics under the title “spirit@telekom.” The survey gives our staff the chance to express ad-hoc opinions on our strate-gic initiatives, their satisfaction and the quality of change as they see it, and thus to play an active role in the Group’s opinion-building process. “spirit@telekom” equips management to gauge the ongoing change processes as well as providing an opportunity to make necessary adjustments.
 605
HR@2009 strategy process.
The HR@2009 project is a vital cornerstone of our HR strategy, which is completely realigning human resources work at Deutsche T elekom and 
equipping it to meet future needs. We are using HR@2009 to establish 
strategy-based, intelligent structures in Human Resources, and to optimize processes and competencies throughout the organization. This will give a 
major boost to the unit’s efficiency. HR@2009 is one of the twelve strategic 
projects in the HR mission and plays a direct role in improving customer and service centricity as well as in Save for Service, the company’s cost-efficiency program. It is therefore pivotal to the success of Deutsche 
T elekom’s business.

ork. 
Maud Pagel, head of Group Diversity Manage-
ment, and her team are the ones who dev elop
 
effective measures to implement the Group’s 
diversity policy. The second will be to intensify international 
exchanges, first and foremost among our expert and executive staff. In our service units, we have already imported best-practices from the inter-national units. Practical deployments in the inter-national arena will heighten our intercultural com-petency, which is a vital prerequisite for a strong diversity culture.
Thirdly, we must do more to support equal oppor-
tunities for women.
One focus is on special mentoring programs that 
back top women performers and therefore put 
more women in management positions. If we 
are to succeed in this, we will need to mesh our 
diversity programs effectively with our human 
resources development processes. Diversity must not simply be an esoteric factor that is far removed 
from our standard processes. If it were, it would 
never achieve a positive impact.
Thank you for talking to us.

Rich in opportunities.
It has long been our tradition to promote the development of media 
competencies of school students and underprivileged groups. T o maintain the viability of our company and our society in future, well educated young people are absolutely essential.

how motivating researching and experimenting can be for little children. This project, intended for elementary school children coming from an 
educationally disadvantaged background, was conducted for the second 
time by the Foundation in 2007. In a two-week course held during the school holidays, 80 boys and girls from Bochum and Kiel could learn how to interact and deal with the natural sciences. They discovered, for instance, how bats are able to have the right orientation in the dark. In another case, they had a close look at the constituents of baking ingredients and their reaction with one another. The knowledge gained by the children in the 
holidays is currently being intensified at the respective schools in weekly 
study groups.
Innovative learning concepts for secondary schools.  As part of the 
secondary school programs, the Foundation works closely with schools 
as well as with partners from extra-curricular education, the goal being to 
effectively combine learning within and outside of school. A successful 
example highlighting this is the “ExperimentierKüche,” a students’ laboratory 
which was set up at Bonn’s Deutsches Museum in 2007. Under the super-
vision of students from Bonn university, school students can experiment 
with everyday chemicals; for instance, they can manufacture gummi bears or get to learn the difference between shampoo and liquid soap. Up to 
the beginning of 2008, 69 school classes with 1,900 students as well as 
29 children’s groups had visited this facility.Promoting education.
Education, research, technology and innovation are indispensable for 
a society which is to remain viable in the future, especially one, such as 
Germany, that is not rich in natural resources. Particularly, the level of education in subjects like mathematics, information technology, natural sciences and technology (MINT) is an important indicator for the innovative capacity of a nation. There is still a tremendous demand on German schools 
to catch up in the fields of natural sciences and technology, as has been 
verified once more in the third PISA report in November 2007. With the 
backing of Deutsche T elekom Foundation, our goal is to raise the level of 
education and teaching concepts in the MINT subjects to the top level on 
the international stage.
Deutsche Telekom Foundation. Deutsche T elekom Foundation, a non-
profit organization, focuses its work along the entire education chain – from 
day care through schools up to the universities – to achieve an improvement 
in the education system, especially for the MINT subjects. Established in 
2003, the Foundation is striving to promote a broad basis and at the same 
time cultivate excellence, working at a conceptual and operative level 
and chiefly realizing its own projects in close cooperation with its partners from science and education.
“Research holidays” and didactic support for elementary schools. 
The foundations for vital intellectual and emotional competence, which are 
required throughout one’s education, are laid in day care centers and elementary schools. Deutsche T elekom Foundation supports government-
run and private educational institutions in designing programs for impart-
ing the necessary skills required to make children of pre-school and school 
age proficient in mathematics, science and technology. The “Early educa-
tion” programs provide teachers with ideas and materials for modern teaching practice and offer them further education schemes to boost their diagnostic and didactic skills in the MINT subjects.Social commitment.
Commitment for a common future.
An exhaustive and reliable access to modern information and communication technology (ICT) which 
is available to people from all walks of life forms the basis of any knowledge society. At the same time, today’s ICT products and services are also considered a significant factor for the affluence and economic progress of a nation. Being one of the world’s leading companies in this sector, we play a decisive role in this development. This is also reflected in our social commitment in which we strive to bring the benefits of modern ICT to the maximum number of people from all walks of life. It has long been our tradition to promote the development of media competencies of school students and underprivileged groups. T o maintain the viability of our company and our society in future, well educated young people are absolutely essential.

our university-level programs we strive to contribute to making Germany 
a strong center of excellence in education and science. The Foundation 
aids selected universities in upgrading their efficiency in the MINT subjects 
and supports the development of training programs for the teaching faculty. 
In all, three new projects were started in 2007 for the training of new and experienced math teachers, including the advanced training project 
“Mathematik Anders Machen” or, in English, “doing math differently.” 
Regional advanced training programs are announced nationwide on the 
Internet platform www.mathematik-anders-machen.de. Courses can be 
booked for free online. In addition to that, new courses can be posted or requested. At the start of the project, Deutsche T elekom Foundation pre-
sented the results of a survey on advanced training requirements for math 
teachers conducted by the Foundation itself. According to this report, there is a major requirement for advanced training of the teaching faculty across all disciplines, from basic education to research and experimenting 
in classes, diagnosing mathematical performance right up to the emotional 
and motivational aspects of learning. By the end of January 2008, more than 800 math teachers attended the programs across Germany and learned 
how to “do math differently.”
In 2008, Deutsche T elekom Foundation is one of the four sponsors of 
the “Year of Mathematics” in Germany. Thus, for the first time, a private sponsor is involved in a year of the sciences. The Foundation contributes several own projects, simultaneously also supporting special events and exhibitions with a total sponsorship volume of around EUR 2 million. The aim is to create greater awareness among the public for mathematics and above all to capture the interest of children and the youth for this fascinating subject. In today’s world, a sound knowledge of mathematics is the basic requirement for many professions, among which we already observe a lack of qualified staff. Career guidance for young women. In view of the demographic changes 
in industrialized nations and the constantly rising need for highly qualified 
personnel, companies are going to find it increasingly hard to find the right staff. Deutsche T elekom is therefore strongly committed to training young 
people and, with the help of innovative strategies, tapping potential that has remained unused to date. Our new program helps pave the way for young women to take up a technical profession and simultaneously contributes to 
equal opportunities.
Following a successful development and pilot phase, Deutsche T elekom 
reached a decision in 2007 to continue the “JUMP in MINT” project. The 
German acronym JUMP stands for youth mentoring program and MINT, as 
described earlier, stands for mathematics, information technology, natural 
sciences and technology. The project was developed and piloted from 2005 
to 2007 as part of the EU initiative “EQUAL.” Its aim is to help young girls with their career choice, particularly encouraging them to take up technical 
professions and giving the necessary support to embark on a career with 
a focus on one of the MINT disciplines. At information get-togethers held once every month, women from technical professions present their personal background. Female employees from companies like Deutsche T elekom 
accompany female school students along their journey to careers so far 
dominated by males. A special Internet portal invites girls and young women 
to participate in a virtual exchange and provides detailed information on 
various professions. In the scope of this project, Deutsche T elekom invites 300 school students and their teachers, once every two years, to Berlin to 
show them and elaborate on the career opportunities in the MINT disciplines.
 
Infrastructure projects at schools.  Traditionally, equipping schools with 
a charge-free Internet connection is at the heart of our commitment. 
Deutsche T elekom’s major goal is to give children the opportunity to learn 
to use digital media purposefully at school itself and without any help 
from home. For this, we have already invested hundreds of millions from 1996 to date. The personal commitment of our employees plays a key role in all these projects.
With its “T elekom@School” initiative, Deutsche T elekom provides Internet 
access free of charge to all 34,000 general education and vocational schools 
throughout Germany. Out of these, 28,000 schools are already connected 
to the broadband network via T-DSL, thereby enabling them to freely use data-intensive study material such as audio and video files or animated graphics. More than 3,500 Deutsche T elekom employees have imparted their know-how – mainly in their free time and without charging a fee – and, by 
the end of 2007, trained around 46,000 teachers in the use of the Internet 
and set up more than 20,000 personal computers.
Our subsidiary Slovak T elekom too has been working in close cooperation 
with the Slovak government since 2002 for promoting digital education at school. Throughout Slovakia, we have equipped all elementary and sec-ondary schools with a PC classroom and broadband Internet connection. In addition to that, we also acknowledge unusual and novel ideas for the 
use of computers at school by awarding the “Slovak T elekom Award.”
In close cooperation with our T-Systems national company in South Africa, 
our subsidiary T-Systems Austria has been providing support to Masibam-
bane College, the Viennese School in Johannesburg, since 2007. This school makes it possible for children who live in utmost poverty to get a 
high-quality primary education. The school was started in 1997 with initially 
47 students. In the meantime, the school boasts more than 660 children 
who are taught from kindergarten to grade six. In 2007, T-Systems Austria 
initially invested EUR 10,000 in the school’s IT infrastructure. Our goal, of course, is to build up a long-term partnership.Social commitment

Modern ICT has revolutionized communications all over the world. Not just that; connecting 
our society at work and in private life is increasing at a rapid pace with growing technological advances. T oday, intelligent monitoring and control systems are applied in almost all sectors of the industry. For example, ICT is the engine for more than 80 percent of Germany’s inno-vations in the automotive, medical technology and logistics sectors. The public sector too is growingly relying on ICT. Under the slogan “e-Government,” several German states and municipalities have already begun reshaping their public administration services to make them more efficient and transparent and bring them closer to citizens.
T-City – future lab for better quality of living and enhanced community amenities. Through T-City, 
Deutsche T elekom together with the city of Fried-richshafen is showing inhabitants, the business 
community and other organizations the added value introduced by innovative ICT and the poten-tial and opportunities that lie undiscovered in 
these technologies. Enhancement in the world 
of communications, streamlining through innova-tive technology, as well as saving of time, money 
and resources can be demonstrated clearly even 
to the skeptics. In addition, there is potential for synergies and advantages for the city thanks to networked innovations.
In February 2007, Friedrichshafen was a step 
ahead of 52 competitors when it was declared 
the winner of the T-City competition. Implemen-
tation of the latest and most innovative network 
infrastructure in the fixed and mobile communi-cations network was launched shortly thereafter. Based on these networks, a series of projects was commenced to demonstrate their benefits to 
the first user groups in T-City. The projects, for 
instance, provide digital solutions for municipal 
administration, a learning platform for local school students, and also convenient applica-
tions in home entertainment and tourism.Spotlight: T-City
Remote patient care – telemedicine in T-City. 
The first health project in T-City got underway on November 1, 2007 at the Friedrichshafen clinic. 
Patients suffering from cardiac insufficiency 
are attended to with the aid of the latest ICT via the Motiva telemedicine system. After being discharged from the clinic, the patients can have 
their vital data monitored even from home.
Special instruments regularly record the patient’s 
weight, blood pressure and pulse. The data is 
transferred automatically via Bluetooth to a set-top box via which it is relayed over a secure network – specifically developed by T-Systems for health care services – to a certified computing center. Over a broadband line, doctors at the Friedrichshafen Clinic can access the stored 
data. They can thus constantly monitor the condi-
tion of their patients, provide feedback, as well as 
inform and train them accordingly. If a serious risk becomes conspicuous, for instance, in the case of severe weight gain, the doctor intervenes immediately. The patient’s television set also 
serves as an interactive interface for additional 
exchange of information. For instance, doctors 
can send text messages to patients; the patient 
can answer questions, or watch a transmission 
with health tips on video.
Thanks to Motiva, the patients of the Fried richs-
hafen Clinic can continue living in their trusted 
environment and simultaneously have the reas-
suring feeling of being in good hands.

In the global race for young talents, corporate commitment will increasingly 
become a critical factor for success. Companies which act responsibly and 
integrate their employees in social projects will enjoy greater confidence 
over others. By demonstrating personal commitment, new avenues will open for employees, and their social and communication skills as well as 
motivation will get a boost. Deutsche T elekom supports the social commit-
ment of their employees at and outside of work. In the course of the strategic 
restructuring of our corporate responsibility (CR) activities, we will further 
expand our corporate volunteering projects within the context of long-term partnerships.
The “Huddle up” campaign in the USA. In 2005, our subsidiary, T-Mobile 
USA, started the “Huddle up” campaign for giving a facelift to recreation areas for children and youth in regions with a lack of infrastructure and economic drive. Throughout the country, all employees have been called on 
to participate and have been excused from work by T-Mobile USA for their voluntary commitment. The resonance for this project has been extraordi-
narily positive. In 2007 itself, more than 2,100 T-Mobile USA employees, 
which makes up 5.4 percent of the total workforce, were involved in one of the 13 projects throughout the country. In all, around 17,000 work hours and substantial sums of money were donated, the equivalent of which was in all USD 1.7 million.
Promoting projects selected by employees.  T-Mobile UK too has found 
an effective way to encourage their employees to volunteer in projects with 
their “Give a little … change a lot” campaign. In principle, T-Mobile UK backs 
every kind of support to recognized non-profit organizations in Britain. T-Mobile exempts each employee from his/her workplace to volunteer up to 15 hours per year in non-profit organization projects; besides, the company doubles all donations of up to £1,000, and donations by teams of up to 
£5,000, and offers to transfer a portion of the salary before tax to a selected 
organization. Via a website and a company hotline, T-Mobile UK also assists 
its employees in finding suitable projects.In 2005, T-Mobile UK was one of the founding members of the Russell Commission, whose main goal is to increase youth volunteering and civic 
service. In connection with this, T-Mobile UK supports both TimeBank, 
which provides more than 10,000 activities, and the Youth Action Network 
which trains volunteers and provides financial assistance for project ideas. 
Both of the organizations follow the common goal of winning over at least one million youth in the age group 16 to 25 for volunteer work.
Volunteer commitment in Hungary.  Our Hungarian subsidiary Magyar 
T elekom too backs their employees’ commitment to participate in volunteer 
programs. Employees, for instance, are engaged in a Hungarian national park or train the inhabitants of remote regions as part of the Digital Bridge 
project’s “Egálnet” program. “Egálnet” is a free-of-charge Internet platform 
set up by Magyar T elekom in 2007 specially for underprivileged sections of the population. Thus, new doors for social and individual networking are opened, for instance, for migrants, youths and the physically challenged. 
The platform is open to all registered users who can use it for exchanging 
information and creating their own websites. News and event tips round up the offer. Since the inception of “Egálnet,” 159 organizations have registered 
to date. Owing to its tremendous popularity, Deutsche T elekom plans to 
implement the program at other locations too.

This report provides detailed information about the strategic realignment 
of Deutsche T elekom’s CR Management ( see page 10 ff.). This realign-
ment also affects our CR targe
ts. We are therefore replacing the roadmap 
in the 2006 Human Resources and Sustainability Report with a selection of 
our new CR targets in the form of a CR program, together with the measures 
with which we intend to achieve these targets. The development and imple-mentation of our CR targets and the expansion of the CR program based 
on these is one of the main focuses of our CR strategy process up to 2010. The “Deadline” column of the program sets targets for their implementation 
and the “Status 2007” column provides information on how we have pro-
gressed in the period under review. As such, our shareholders can use the 
program as a comparative basis for evaluating our CR performance when 
the next CR report is published in 2009. 
Like the present report, our CR program is structured according to areas 
of action – customers, ecology, suppliers, human resources, and social 
commitment. We intend to measurably improve our performance in these 
areas by the time the next CR report is published in 2009.

Sustainability indicators.
T o provide a transparent and comparable view of our sustainability perfor-
mance, we introduced two “Sustainability Excellence Key Performance  Indicators” (SE KPIs) in 2006. These two SE KPIs are based on independent external evaluations by customers and non-customers as well as on assessments by experts and document the development and achieve-ments of our sustainability activities.
SE KPI 1: “Customer perception of corporate responsibility.”
  2007 2006 2005
Customer perception on a scale from 
2 to 10, with 10 being the best rating 6.35 6.8 6.4
The first indicator is based on customer perception of Deutsche T elekom’s 
responsibility toward society. The figure is ascertained by an external 
 market research institute on the basis of a representative survey of 1,000 
consumers and 600 business customers of the Group in Germany.
The second SE KPI is based on evaluable results from sustainability ratings 
issued by external rating agencies. The results underscore how well-received 
our sustainability activities are among experts.
SE KPI 2: “Assessment of Deutsche Telekom’s sustainability performance in sustainability ratings.”

and 2007 in line with the industry trend. The general rise in consumption  is the result of technology developments (DSL), increasing transmission volumes and network expansion. Other reasons for the increase in power consumption outside Germany are marked expansion of the infrastructure and activities in several countries. The rise in power consumption in Austria is accounted for by the fact that the figure now includes the data for all technical systems and shops.

Emissions are calculated on the basis of consumption of electrical power, 
district heating and fossil fuels. This was executed in line with the Global 
Emission Model for Integrated Systems (GEMIS, www.oeko.de/service/gemis/de/) and includes emissions that occur in the stages preceding 
energy generation (total lifecycle but excluding waste disposal). This 
raises the specific emission rates and the emissions calculated from them 
to about one-third above what they would be if the International Energy 
Agency (IEA) or Greenhouse Gas (GHG) protocol data had been applied. 
The marked divergence in emissions compared to the underlying energy 
consumption in some countries is accounted for by the new specific emis-
sion rates (update to GEMIS 4.42).By executing various measures, Deutsche T elekom was again able to lower the indirect CO
2 emissions resulting from power consumption in Germany 
in the year 2007. It lowered CO 2 pollution significantly, thanks above all 
to the purchase of 1.606 TWh of renewable energy certificates (RECS – Renewable Energy Certificate System). This meant that we procured almost 68 percent of our electrical energy in Germany from renewable energy sources in 2007 (share of the German power mix and RECS certificates). In 2008 we raised this figure to 100 percent.
T-Mobile UK launched various measures aimed at reducing energy con-
sumption and changing to a low-emission energy source, thereby cutting its power-related emissions by just under 40 percent.In Germany, the measures that were launched to save energy and increase 
efficiency offset a major part of this growth. Energy consumption was also greatly reduced in a number of our international subsidiaries. T elecom Croatia achieved a significant drop in heating energy consumption. Slovak T elekom cut its consumption of electrical power in 2007 by 14 percent compared with the previous year. Magyar T elekom in Hungary was also very active and successfully reduced its energy consumption and emissions. The measures it installed include the use of renewable energies, an increase in energy  efficiency and raising awareness within the workforce.

With its extensive package of measures, Deutsche T elekom works continually 
on severing the link between its business operations and CO 2 emissions. 
From 2008 the company’s electricity needs in Germany will be covered 
completely from renewable energy sources (share of the German power mix 
and RECS certificates). 2 
As a result, we will far outreach our original objective, namely to halve the CO
2 emissions that resulted from power consumption in Germany in 1995 
by 2010.

Deutsche T elekom’s mobility needs have increased steadily in Germany over the past few years. The strategic realignment of the Group and the 
resulting organizational changes have led to heavier vehicle use in the last few years. The slight rise in vehicle numbers has resulted in a minimal increase in mileage.

Above all at our locations in Eastern Europe, increased mobility needs in 
2007 led to increased mileage compared with the previous year. However, 
the average fuel consumption for the Group’s vehicle fleets fell during the 
same period. The reduction in fuel consumption despite increased mile-
age is largely accounted for by continual modernization of the vehicle fleet with lower consumption engines. In Hungary alone, 18 hybrid vehicles have been in use since 2007. 
Water consumption is not linked to provision of services to customers 
and mainly arises from the use of sanitary installations and watering the 
company gardens. This is the reason why little effort is made to record 
water consumption figures.
Water consumption data is ascertained in Germany on the basis of costs. 
In the foreign subsidiaries, some data is collected by projecting billing 
figures, metering data and making estimates. The cost data is based on 
bills issued by facility management companies that include public utility 
accounts. Due to varying billing periods, the figures may be subject to time 
differences for entering, billing and reporting consumption.Water consumption of the Deutsche Telekom Group.

a T echnical waste is recorded with waste totals in a waste register.
b Data is ascertained with estimates based on supplier documents.
c Waste data largely refers to administrative buildings. Shop data was projected by averaging the available data.
d  Magyar T elekom only measures hazardous waste (volume and waste type). It estimates all other technical waste on the basis of data supplied by Procurement. 
The volume data for 2005 and 2006 also includes Montenegro.
In 2007, a T-Home cable retrieval project produced a far higher volume of cable and plastic waste than in previous years (sleeves included). In the course of the cable retrieval project in the second half of 2007, abandoned underground cable laid in Deutsche T elekom’s conduit systems was 
retrieved from the ground and sent for copper and lead recycling prior to disposal. With this special project alone, 21,405 metric tons of cable were 
retrieved and disposed of in 2007. The cable retrieval project will continue 
in 2008. In standard disposal activities, the volume of cable waste has 
dropped slightly.
The waste data reported by our subsidiaries in 2007 shows reduced 
 volumes in some instances. The reasons for this have not yet been analyzed.
Waste data in our international subsidiaries is chiefly ascertained from 
 service provider billing data or projected on the basis of information from 
suppliers. Concrete data is normally documented for hazardous waste.
Volumes of municipal waste and waste paper for Germany are calculated 
on the basis of cross-company figures. T o do this, the waste figures are 
converted by density into volume and weight and projected as annual totals on the basis of employee figures. Annual waste recycling rate of the Deutsche Telekom Group in Germany.

Deutsche T elekom introduced its own company pension fund as long 
ago as 2002 in order to provide its employees with financial security at the 
end of their working lives. The number of employees participating in the 
T elekom Pension Fund (TPF) dropped slightly in the period under review. 
The total number of contracts as of December 31, 2007 was 39,365. At the 
same time, the fund developed positively on the financial side. Due to declining headcount in Germany, the number of capital account obligations 
for the employer-financed company pension scheme fell in 2007, totaling 
108,509 on December 31, 2007.In 2007, restructuring measures and changes in processes and reporting led to a significant decline in accidents that occurred on the way to and from or at work and that are subject to reporting obligations at Deutsche T elekom AG compared with the previous year. A modified monitoring system will be launched in Germany and across the Deutsche T elekom Group in 2008.

Our employees submitted a total of 8,841 ideas in the year 2007, 1,200 
of them as part of the Ideas for Service competition. This raised the number 
of submissions slightly on 2006. The improvement measures based on 
suggestions from our employees generated savings of EUR 99 million for 
the Group. Moreover, 542 new patents were applied for in 2007.
In order to exploit the potential offered by our employees even better, we 
want to raise the number and quality of ideas in the future, and to improve 
our ideas management processes. In 2007, the relevant structures and 
processes were checked. The findings will be used in 2008 to realign the Group’s ideas management system as part of the HR@2009 project.Key indicators

*  Since January 1, 2007 reporting of Magyar T elekom has included a further breakdown of results 
into the segments Business Customers and Group Headquarters & Shared Services. In previous 
periods, these results were reported under Broadband/Fixed Networks. Prior-year figures have been adjusted accordingly.
T echnological development, high competitive pressure and regulatory pol-
icy in Germany, aimed at distributing Deutsche T elekom’s market share among competitors, are forcing Deutsche T elekom to make regular adjust-ments to its workforce in order to bring it into line with customer and  business volumes. These personnel restructuring activities go hand in hand with staff rightsizing first and foremost in the Fixed Network segment. This is being executed above all in Group units in Germany and Eastern Europe. However, in strong growth markets such as the mobile communications market in the USA we were able to recruit additional staff in 2007.Vivento is the internal service provider that handles staff surplus and placement management at Deutsche T elekom. Since its foundation in 2002, around 38,600 employees from the Group have been transferred to Vivento. With effect from December 31, 2007, 3,600 employees left Vivento, reducing the total workforce to 10,200. Of these 600 were permanent staff, 5,200 emplo-yees in the Vivento Business Lines and around 4,200 transfer emplo yees. Around 2,900 of the transfer employees had temporary assignments at the time. A total of 28,300 people have left Vivento since it came into existence.Vivento workforce.

Deutsche T elekom and ver.di agreed on an above-average trainee ratio for 
2007 at around 8.4 percent of the Group’s national workforce (excl. Vivento). 
The trainee ratio will be maintained at this high level in the years 2008 to 
2010. It lies at an annual ratio of 2.9 percent of the permanent workforce in 
Germany.As in previous years, Deutsche T elekom did more than simply fulfill the 
legal requirement of providing 5 percent of its jobs for severely disabled 
 persons in 2007. Under Germany’s statutory provisions, private and public 
employers with a minimum of 20 workplaces are obliged to comply with 
this ratio. For many years, Deutsche T elekom has demonstrated its commit-ment to its responsibility for people with disabilities and continues to set 
up barrier-free workplaces to meet individual needs.

engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on selected data 
of the Corporate Responsibility Report in German language and issued 
an independent assurance report in German language, which has been 
translated as follows: 
Independent Assurance ReportT o Deutsche T elekom AG, BonnWe have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on 
selected data of the report “Connected life and work – Corporate Respon-
sibility Report 2008” (the “Corporate Responsibility Report”) prepared by 
Deutsche T elekom AG, Bonn.
Management’s Responsibility. Deutsche T elekom AG’s Board of Manag-
ing Directors is responsible for the preparation of the Corporate Respon-
sibility Report in accordance with the criteria stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 (pp. 7-17) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI): 
Materiality, Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability Context, Complete-
ness, Balance, Clarity, Accuracy, Timeliness, Comparability and Reliability. This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the Corporate Responsibility Report and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual disclosures which are reasonable 
in the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, 
implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the 
preparation of the Corporate Responsibility Report.
Practitioner’s Responsibility.  Our responsibility is to express a conclusion 
based on our work performed as to whether any matters have come to 
our attention that cause us to believe that the data of the Corporate Respon-sibility Report marked with a check symbol (  
) has not been prepared in 
accordance with the above mentioned criteria of the Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines Vol. 3 of the GRI. 
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000. This standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to express our conclusion with limited assurance. In a limited assurance 
engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than in a 
reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained 
than in a reasonable assurance engagement.The procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgment. This includes the assessment of the risk of material incompliance of the data 
marked with a check symbol (  
) with the above mentioned criteria. 
Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures:
–  Inspection of the processes for gathering, analysing and aggregating 
the selected data marked with a check symbol (  
) on the level of the 
headquarter and on the level of operations.
–  Inquiries of the central unit responsible for preparing the Corporate 
Responsibility Report about the process to prepare the report and the 
internal control system aligned with this process.
–  Comparison of selected data with corresponding data in the financial 
report 2007.
–  Inquiries of employees of the central units of CR Strategy/Controlling, 
Idea management, Human Resources, Social Responsibility/Communi-
cation, and Sustainable Development/Environment.
–  Examination of the system of determining CO 2 emissions regarding 
the process and responsibilities, limitations of the system and emissions factors as well as use of the audit results regarding 2007 data of the TÜV 
assurance report for electricity usage of Deutsche T elekom in Germany. 
–  Obtaining evidence for the accuracy of the data marked with a check 
symbol (  
), e.g. by inspecting notifications to public authorities and 
contracts and by analysing data based on IT-system reports.
Conclusion. Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the data of the Corpo-
rate Responsibility Report marked with a check symbol (  ) has not been 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria of the 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 (pp. 7-17) of the GRI.

GRI index and 
Global Compact Communication on Progress.
Deutsche T elekom’s 2008 Corporate Responsibility (CR) Report fully meets 
the current guidelines (G3) from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), 
including the pilot version of the T elecommunications Sector Supplement 
of 2003. GRI has checked and confirmed this with an “A+,” the highest application level. 
The following GRI index indicates to what extent we take the GRI indicators 
into account. At the same time, it shows where in the report the indicators 
are dealt with. For some indicators, we also refer to the 2008 CR Online 
Report and other publications of the Deutsche T elekom Group. Additional indicators, whose fulfillment is not compulsory for level A, are printed in gray.
A detailed GRI index is published in the 2008 CR Online Report. There 
you can find additional information for the individual indicators, and an 
explanation why Deutsche T elekom does not make reference to certain 
indicators. In some cases, this is due to the materiality process, which 
preceded the report process.

Digital divide.  The term digital divide refers to a situation in which 
people do not have the same degree of access to modern digital 
information and communication technologies (ICT) and, for this reason, do not have the same opportunities for social and economic development. As a leading ICT enterprise, Deutsche T elekom sees itself responsible for giving people within its sphere of influence broad access to ICT and, in this way, for preventing inequality.
EMF – Electromagnetic fields.  Electromagnetic fields are a combina-
tion of electric and magnetic fields. They are produced when electric 
current and charges change. This forms an electromagnetic wave, which transfers energy. Some EMFs occur in nature – daylight, for example – while others are generated by technical apparatus.
E-TASC – Electronics-Tool for Accountable Supply Chain. The 
electronics industry’s information tool – E-TASC – is an innovative instrument that helps us to establish transparency with regard to the social and ecological aspects of our supply chain.
GeSI – Global e-Sustainability Initiative.  GeSI is a joint initiative 
established by the world’s leading ICT organizations with the objective 
of improving sustainability in the ICT sector. Deutsche T elekom is a member of GeSI, as are many other leading enterprises.
Global Compact. Global Compact, the initiative founded in 2000 
by the then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a “global pact,” aims to support and strengthen cooperation between the United Nations, industry and other social gr oups. It sets out ten principles 
relating to the protection of human rights, employment, social and environmental standards, and the fight against corruption, and calls on companies to incorporate these into their corporate policies. Deutsche T elekom originally declared its commitment to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the year 2000.
ICT. Information and Communication T echnology.ISO 14001. The international environmental management standard 
ISO 14001 defines requirements that are accepted worldwide for environmental management systems. They focus on a continual improvement  process in the implementation of green goals in busi-ness enterprises and other institutions. These can have their environ-mental management systems certified to the ISO 14001 standard by independent environmental auditors.
KPI – Key Performance Indicator.  In business administration, 
key per formance indicators are figures that are used to measure the 
progress that an organization has made in the implementation of its main objectives.Low-carbon society. The term “low-carbon society” refers to a scenario for future development of the world economy in which greenhouse gas emissions, above all CO
2 emissions, are greatly reduced in order 
to slow down the ongoing climate change. Increased efficiency based on the use of innovative information and communication technologies can play a vital role in this field.
RECS – Renewable Energy Certificates System. RECS was intro-
duced in 2002 in order to promote the development of renewable energies at international level. The system now operates in 24 coun-tries in Europe as well as in Canada, the USA and South Africa. The standard certificate awarded by RECS guarantees that identifiable amounts of electrical energy are  supplied from specific regenerative sources, thus making regenerative, CO
2-neutral energy freely tradable. 
Procurement of these certificates when buying energy means that the quantities purchased can be allocated to the certificate acquirer. Deutsche T elekom relies on this system to obtain all the energy it needs in Germany from regenerative sources.
SAR – Specific Absorption Rate. The SAR is measured in watts per 
kilogram of body weight. It is a measure of the rate at which electro-magnetic energy is absorbed and converted to body heat. The SAR levels of all mobile phones sold by T-Mobile comply with the limits set out in international guidelines, and generally fall well below them.
Social Audit. In order to embrace the Deutsche T elekom values 
throughout our procurement processes, we hold special assessment procedures, known as Social Audits, on a regular basis. The key components of these Social Audits are:– Risk assessment– Supplier self-assessment– Internal supplier assessment–  Personal contact and constructive dialog with suppliers and 
business partners
– Audit report including audit evaluation.
SPWG – Sustainable Procurement Working Group.  T o ensure 
a sustainable, universal procurement strategy is implemented, 
Deutsche T elekom sets up a cross-Group body in 2007: the Sustain-able Procurement Working Group (SPWG). The Working Group is the central point of contact for all issues and problems relating to sustainable procurement. The SPWG’s  primary aims include clearly mapping out a suitable procurement profile, devising exacting social and environmental standards as well as monitoring the procurement process in accordance with these standards.
T-Laboratories. The T-Laboratories are a research and development 
institute that Deutsche T elekom opened in Berlin in 2005. The institute is an associate of T echnische Universität Berlin and gives top scientists from all over the world the chance to work in an attractive research environment. The institute’s work focuses on the development of innovative services and solutions for Deutsche T elekom customers.About this report.
More than ten years ago, Deutsche T elekom began reporting about its 
commitment in social activities. Initially, environment issues had been our 
main concern. With the growing interest of the public and our stakeholders 
on the subject of sustainability, the scope of our reporting too has been extended. Since 2003, Deutsche T elekom has published its annual com-
bined report on human resources and sustainability. The interim report 
“Corporate Responsibility (CR) Facts & Figures” from 2007 serves as the 
transition to the present form of reporting. With “Connected life and work. 
Bringing people together. Embracing responsibility. Finding solutions.” 
we are pleased to present our first, in-depth CR report. Aim of the report is to give a detailed account to our stakeholders and the general public about 
the activities, progress and goals of our company in business, social and environmental issues. The report also serves as an 
update of Deutsche T elekom’s progress in the scope of the 
United Nations Global Compact.
Our present report is modeled in compliance with the interna-tionally recognized guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) G3 including the T elecommunications Sector Supple-ment (pilot version 1.0). By awarding the highest Application 
Level of “A+,” the GRI has acknowledged Deutsche T elekom’s exacting 
adherence to the initiative’s requirements of open and transparent report-
ing. While selecting the topics portrayed within the present report, we have 
also considered, apart from the recommendations issued by the GRI, the results of a materiality workshop conducted in December 2007. T aking into 
account the perspective of external stakeholders, the key fields of respon-
sibility for Deutsche T elekom, the most material issues, were identified. 
These issues were subsequently assigned to corresponding CR areas of 
action, viz. customers, ecology, suppliers, human resources and social commitment, each of which forms one chapter of the present report. As 
part of these chapters, spotlights focus on particularly challenging issues 
in the telecommunications sector, as seen from the perspective of impor-
tant stakeholders, as well as Deutsche T elekom’s responses to these 
 topics. Subjects not discussed in the printed CR report are dealt with in the online report. The 
 symbol and a numeral indicate where additional 
information is available online. By entering these numerals in the search field of the CR Online Report, the reader is led directly to the Internet 
page containing the desired information. In addition, our Group portal, www.telekom.com/corporate-responsibility, presents constantly updated 
reports on our CR activities.
The key indicators section at the end of the report presents an overview of 
selected consolidated key indicators of Deutsche T elekom. Some of these 
key indicators have been examined by independent auditors for accuracy, completeness and adequacy. The result is presented in the certification on page 70. 
The report is a Group report and incorporates all Group subsidiaries in 
which Deutsche T elekom holds a majority interest. The reporting period 
applies to the financial year 2007. However, we have also included 
relevant information from 2008 available to us by the editorial deadline on February 29, 2008. We may also report beyond the editorial deadline in exceptional cases to reflect the latest developments. The data protection spotlight, for example, was updated in October 2008. “Connected life 
and work. Bringing people together. Embracing responsibility. Finding 
solutions.” is available in both the English and German language versions. 
Our next CR report is due to be published in summer 2009.

KNr. 642 200 148 (English)This Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect 
the current views of Deutsche T elekom management with 
respect to future events. They are generally identified by the 
words “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” “aim,” “goal,” “plan,” “will,” “seek,” “outlook” or similar expres-
sions and include generally any information that relates to 
expectations or targets for revenue, adjusted EBITDA or other 
performance measures. Forward-looking statements are 
based on current plans, estimates, and projections, and 
should therefore be considered with caution. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are diffi-
cult to predict and are generally beyond Deutsche T elekom’s 
control, including those described in the sections “Forward-
Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” of the Company’s 
Form 20-F report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission. Among the relevant factors are the progress 
of Deutsche T elekom’s workforce reduction initiative and the impact of other significant strategic or business initiatives, including acquisitions, dispositions and business combinations. In addition, regulatory rulings, stronger than expected com-
petition, technological change, litigation and regulatory devel-
opments, among other factors, may have a material adverse effect on costs and revenue development. If these or other risks 
and uncertainties materialize, or if the assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, Deutsche T elekom’s actual results may be materially different from those expressed 
or implied by such statements. Deutsche T elekom can offer 
no assurance that its expectations or targets will be achieved. 
Without prejudice to existing obligations under capital market law, Deutsche T elekom does not assume any obligation to 
update forward-looking statements to take new information 
or future events into account or otherwise.
