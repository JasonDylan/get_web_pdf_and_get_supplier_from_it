2018 Corporate  
Responsibility Report
The economic, environmental and social challenges facing us 
today call for new solutions – and Verizon is at the forefront of delivering them. 5G technology and the array of Fourth Industrial Revolution innovations transforming our world hold the potential to create a cleaner, healthier, more inclusive world in which people from all backgrounds can achieve their full potential. And today, Verizon is building toward that future by working in communities to connect people and businesses to each other and to the services they need, to help cities operate and use energy more efficiently, and to give under-resourced students access to technology and education that will help them succeed in the digital economy. We’re working in partnership with communities and national organizations such as the National Urban League, National Disability Leadership Alliance and many others that provide us with perspectives and advice as we develop policy and make business decisions to help address the issues they’re confronting. We’re also finding new ways to leverage Verizon’s technology to create solutions that address the issues described in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This is Verizon’s road to progress, and it’s how we’re using our technology to tackle the world’s biggest challenges.T able of contents

T oward a more 
sustainable  and equitable futureAt Verizon, our mission is to deliver the promise of the digital world by 
empowering people to generate innovation and positive change.

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportSenior social responsibility leader Rose Kirk addresses how Verizon ‘s Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy today is building on past success – tackling the biggest problems in the world to benefit our customers, shareholders, employees and society.A conversation 
with Rose KirkPriorities  |  Leadership Q & A
Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer & President, Verizon Foundation 
We’re sharpening our vision of what 
social responsibility means at Verizon, 
and that vision is a bold one: T o tackle the biggest problems in the world to benefit our customers, shareholders, employees and society.Q:  T oday there is a heightened interest in a company’s purpose, going beyond financial performance to assess how it delivers value for all its stakeholders. How is Verizon’s CSR strategy evolving?
A:
  W e’re sharpening our vision of what social responsibility means at Verizon, 
and that vision is a bold one: T o tackle the biggest problems in the world to benefit our customers, shareholders, employees and society. We are being even more intentional about understanding the pressing economic and social challenges that communities are dealing with and leveraging products and solutions to address them. Also, we are working to ensure that socially responsible practices are integrated throughout every facet of our business and become a core element of our corporate DNA. Our focus is on minimizing the environmental footprint of our own operations, and also on working with our vendors to improve the energy efficiency of the components and equipment that comprise our world-class network. Moreover, as a purchaser of more than $50 billion of goods and services, we are working in partnership with our suppliers to promote ethical and responsible business practices throughout our ecosystem. As a champion of diversity and inclusion, we are working not only within our own company and among our suppliers and business partners, but also serving as a leading voice among technology providers to ensure that the digital world provides equitable opportunities so that no one is left behind. 7
Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportPriorities  |  Leadership Q & A
Q:  For many years Verizon has been recognized as a leader in 
diversity and inclusion. How does that approach contribute to business success?
A:  We are proud of our standing as a leader in diversity and inclusion, not only in our industry, but among all major corporations. We are consistently recognized as a top employer for veterans, people of color, women and people with disabilities. And at Verizon, diversity starts at the top. Half of our board members are women or people of color, and these groups each fill roughly a third of our senior management positions.  
 Our business is all about innovation. In order to attract and retain the very best innovators, it’s essential that we have a work culture that is inclusive and lets employees bring their authentic selves to work every day. Also, our primary goal is to serve our customers’ needs. The millions of customers we serve are diverse across every dimension, and a diverse and inclusive team is an absolute necessity to understand and meet their expectations.
 
Q:  In today’s digital world, privacy is more relevant than ever. As you think about Verizon’s CSR strategy and objectives, what role do privacy and data security play?
A:  The digital world offers myriad opportunities to improve lives and address economic, environmental and social challenges. But we know this: consumers will allow us to roll out these innovations only if they trust us with their information. That’s why we are committed to transparency. Our privacy policy explains what information we collect about our customers, how it is used and the choices our customers can make. In addition, we have safeguards in place to guard against unauthorized use or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, and have made significant investments in our security programming so that we have the capabilities we need to stay ahead of current and future cyber threats. Getting privacy and security right, and strengthening the foundation of trust with our customers are fundamental to the success of our business over the long term.  
 Verizon’s Chief Privacy Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, both of whom are women, are leading the charge so that Verizon is well positioned to meet the diverse needs and expectations of our customers and ensure trust with their data. They participate in the efforts of numerous organizations composed of diverse stakeholders so that they are actively engaged in how new developments can engender even greater consumer trust. 
Q:  You have a goal to cut the carbon intensity of your operations in half by 2025. Are on you on track with this and other environmental commitments?
 
A:  Since 2016, we have reduced our carbon intensity by 28 percent and are on pace to reach our goal. In 2018, we announced a new commitment to source renewable energy equivalent to 50 percent of our total electricity usage by 2025, a significant undertaking for a company of our size. This will further contribute to reducing our carbon intensity. Verizon recently issued a $1 billion green bond, a first for our industry in the U.S., with proceeds to be used to fund key environmental priorities like renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings, water conservation and biodiversity. So, even as we make gains toward our goals, we are raising the bar on our environmental objectives.

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportPriorities  |  Leadership Q & A
Q:  Why is STEM education such an important priority for Verizon?
A:  T oday, millions of American students are lacking the technology and skills 
required for success in a world that grows more digital every day. As a country, we cannot ignore the importance of developing the next generation of technology savvy citizens to fuel a healthy economy and promote our global competitiveness.  
 
 Verizon’s efforts to close the digital divide are aimed at helping those with little or no access to the digital world gain the ability to use technology in economically advantageous ways.  
 Our Verizon Innovative Learning program provides free technology, free internet access and a next-gen, technology-infused curriculum that changes the way teachers teach and students learn. We work hand in hand with nonprofit partners and our team of education and technology experts to build and administer STEM-focused programs from the ground up. We carefully measure and refine our programs to ensure we’re making a difference – and we have.  Our programs drive real academic improvements such as improved math achievement and increased student engagement as compared to non-Verizon Innovative Learning schools.  
 Additionally, we are committed to being the first to bring 5G technology to the classroom, where our students and teachers will be at the forefront of the transformative technology that will drive the Fourth Industrial Revolution. T echnology such as virtual and augmented reality and advanced, low-latency robotics, along with more immersive collaboration experiences will further prepare the next generation for tomorrow’s digital world.  
 Since 2012, we have committed a total of $400 million to help under-resourced communities bridge the digital divide. We have helped more than 1 million kids to date and plan to help roughly 2 million more by 2021.

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportOur CSR strategy is grounded in our priorities, which are defined by our 
Credo – the set of principles that describe who we are and what Verizon’s customers value. Many principles of our Credo, including focus outward on the customer, having integrity at our core, embracing diversity and sharing our success with the community are inherent in our social responsibility framework. This framework outlines the focus areas in which we are infusing social responsibility practices into our core operations. They are:
Growth and customers:  We are building processes to identify and pursue 
market opportunities that address economic and social challenges while 
enabling significant revenue generation for Verizon. In addition, we are working to ensure that our product development processes incorporate product life cycle considerations, and our business cases include environmental and human rights considerations.
Performance excellence:  We are further integrating efforts to minimize 
our environmental impact into our processes, and finding additional ways 
to work in partnership with our suppliers to scale these efforts. In addition, we are targeting opportunities to align with the social responsibility goals of our partners and suppliers to effect positive change on a global scale.
Tru st :  We are redoubling our efforts to be transparent and put policies in 
place that engender customer trust.We partnered with BSR, the global sustainability nonprofit, to identify and 
prioritize the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues most relevant to our stakeholders. We group those issues into three categories: A strategy derived from

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportStrengthening our 
commitmentsPriorities  |  Our Purpose & Goals
With the inherent capability to address global societal challenges, Verizon 
technology underpins the innovation that can lead to achievement of all 17 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, we have determined that our technology and assets can have unique impact in addressing SDG 4: providing young people with relevant skills for good jobs and entrepreneurship and SDG 8: promoting an environmentally sustainable economy. In addition, we have set aggressive goals that align with SDG 13: climate action. As we continue our work to address society’s big challenges, we will continue  
to identify additional SDGs that our technology has the potential to help achieve. We anticipate that this will lead to setting goals that focus on additional SDG targets.  
As part of our strategy, we set goals that demonstrate how we are contributing to the achievement of these SDGs:
 By 2021, Verizon will help provide 3 million students with 
the skills required to put them on the path to success in an increasingly tech-dependent job market. 
By 2022, Verizon’s networks and connected solutions will 
save more than double the amount of global emissions that our operations create. 
In late 2018, we set an additional goal that aligns with SDG 13:
 By 2025, Verizon will source renewable energy equivalent 
to 50 percent of our total electricity usage.Also in alignment with SDG 13,  
we have made progress with these existing goals:
By 2020, 80 percent of our assessed suppliers will be compliant with Verizon’s 
overall CSR standards. By 2025, we will reduce water consumption by 15 percent against our  
2016 baseline.By 2025,  we will reduce our carbon intensity (a measure of the carbon our 
business emits divided by the terabytes of data carried by our networks) by  
50 percent against our 2016 baseline.By 2030,  we will plant 2 million trees in communities around the world,  
including 250,000 in areas impacted by the 2017 hurricane season.11In This Section
Education is the fuel that powers innovation and creates a more sustainable future. That’s 
why Verizon has made significant, long-term investments in STEM education in America’s schools – supporting innovative programs that reach students in underserved areas. Our work to build and strengthen communities also encompasses volunteerism by thousands of V T eamers, a leading role in responding to natural disasters, and our commitment to leverage our technology in diverse and exciting ways to help people do more in this world.Education

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportMillions of students lack access to 
technology in the classroom and at home. Without those resources they run the risk of being left behind in a world that grows ever more digital by the day. Moreover, our nation’s ability to be globally competitive, and our economic prospects, will be imperiled if we do not bridge the digital divide and succeed in leveraging the talent of all our young people. Since 2012, the Verizon Foundation has been working to support those students through a transformative program called Verizon Innovative Learning.

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportUnfortunately, 2018 brought natural disasters to many of the areas we 
serve. Our Credo tells us to run to a crisis, not away, and Verizon and our employees stepped forward in a variety of ways to help those who were victims of hurricanes, wildfires, floods, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Our employees helped millions of people impacted by these disasters get back on their feet. In total, Verizon donated more than $4.6 million to disaster recovery and community projects throughout the U.S., including $1 million to the American Red Cross for Hurricane Michael relief.
Verizon launched an Emergency Resource Center Hub, which provides updates

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportMore progress 
toward our goalsEnvironment  |  Emissions & Carbon Intensity
We aggressively pursue strategies to reduce emissions and drive greater 
energy efficiency across Verizon’s operations. More than 92 percent of 
Verizon’s emissions come from the electricity we use to power our networks. We place a particular emphasis on increasing the energy efficiency of our larger wireless core data centers. 
In pursuit of our goal to reduce carbon intensity by one-half by 2025 compared 
to our 2016 baseline, we focus on increasing our use of renewable energy and on initiatives like copper-to-fiber migrations, facilities improvements and changes in our fleet operations.
We are pursuing opportunities for continued, sustained progress and will 
continue to measure and disclose our performance against the 2025 carbon intensity goal. Our results are independently assured. We commissioned independent external assurance of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 (exclusively business travel) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon intensity for 2017 and reported the results in our 2018 CDP Climate Change Response ( CDP .net ) 
and on our corporate site. In 2017 , we achieved a 28 percent reduction in the carbon intensity of our operations against our 2016 baseline. We are currently undergoing independent external assurance of our 2018 GHG emissions and carbon intensity and will report the results when they become available.

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportDuring the course of the past seven years, Verizon has made it a priority to 
deploy more green energy resources – such as solar and fuel cell technology – in our facilities. In 2016, we set a goal to add an additional 24 megawatts of  green energy in our operations by 2025.
In 2018 Verizon committed to a new goal: to source or generate renewable  
energy equivalent to 50 percent of our total annual electricity consumption  
by 2025. We’ll achieve this by continuing our development of renewables at  our own operations and by sourcing green energy from external sources.
Early in 2019 we issued our first-ever green bond , a debt instrument aligned with 
the interests of a growing number of environmentally conscious investors. The 
bond’s $1 billion proceeds will be used to fund important environmental initiatives in the areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings, water conservation and biodiversity.Adopting an

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportBetter systems,
best practicesEnvironment  |  Efficient Facilities & Logistics
A commitment to installing energy-efficient systems and employing energy 
management best practices contributes to reaching our goal to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Facilities improvements include mechanical and whole-building control systems, LED lighting, high-efficiency motors, economizers, cable dehydrators and high-efficiency uninterruptible power supplies. 
Better cooling technologies in our data centers further our progress towards 
reduced carbon intensity, and these approaches have improved power utilization effectiveness (PUE) at these facilities. Extensive deployment of economizers, which bring outside air into the HVAC system when it is cooler outside than in, also reduce energy consumption.
Altogether we have 354 LEED-certified buildings and 278 ENERGY ST AR-
certified buildings, and we are committed to pursuing ENERGY ST AR certification for 100 percent of eligible facilities.
More efficient logistics
Over the past year Verizon Wireless has reduced our shipping carbon intensity – the amount of CO
2 emitted per pound shipped through our supply chain – 
by 15 percent compared to 2017 . These logistics improvements represent the removal of approximately 5,633 metric tons of CO
2 emissions from the 
atmosphere, or the annual equivalent of about 13 million passenger vehicle miles.For the  
6th consecutive year, 
Verizon was named as an ENERGY STAR  Partner of the Year and was again 
recognized for Sustained Excellence.
A big reason for the improvement? We’ve changed the way customers send 
and receive packages when they buy a new device or when they participate in Verizon’s T rade-in program. Formerly, customers purchasing a new device and trading in an old phone would receive a package containing their new device from one distribution center and a second empty package from another facility to return their trade-in device. Thanks to operational and IT improvements, these customers now receive a single package with their new device and all the materials needed to complete their trade-in. It creates an easier and more environmentally friendly experience for our customers.31
Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportSupporting lower-
carbon alternativesEnvironment  |  Efficient Mobility
We continue to focus on improving the fuel efficiency of our fleet. As we 
replace older service vans, we are switching from V8 to V6 engines because 
they are more fuel efficient. In addition, as we replace aerial lifts, we have switched to systems that run solely on electric power so a technician can turn off the vehicle’s main engine. 
As we work toward a lower carbon future, electric vehicles (EVs) are playing  
an increasing role in making personal mobility more environmentally efficient.  
T o support that transition, and to help our employees reduce their emissions  
and carbon footprint, we’re expanding our capacity for EV charging at 
Verizon facilities.

Verizon is committed to the sustainable sourcing and use of paper, and 
our approach is detailed in our paper sourcing and use policy, found here: verizon.com/about/our-company/company-policies/paper-sourcing-and-use-policy .
In support of that commitment we have adopted an annual public goal: that at least 50 percent of the paper we source includes 10 percent postconsumer waste (PCW) content. In 2018, we exceeded our goal, achieving 65 percent of our sourced paper including at least 10 percent PCW content. (This total excludes billing segments that cannot be printed on recycled content paper as a result of machinery issues.) 
Over the past four years, Verizon Wireless has reduced the amount of printed 
material for customer orders by 70 percent compared to 2014 levels. For 2018 this represents avoiding the use of approximately 157 tons of paper, the equivalent of about 3,100 trees, compared with 2017 .

Our goal is to divert cell phones, set-top boxes and other electronic devices from 
landfills by reusing or recycling them. We refurbish and redistribute Fios set-top 
boxes and recycle Verizon-owned equipment, including network equipment, batteries and other supplies. 
We also engage with customers and the community by conducting public 
recycling rallies to collect e-waste in the communities we serve. In 2018,  
we held 53 e-waste recycling events. Through these events, we gathered 500,289 pounds of material for recycling, enough to offset 725.3 metric tons  
of CO
2e emissions. 
Internal recycling and conservation programsWe’ve reduced the use of plastic model phones for marketing purposes by  45 percent since 2015. This amounts to approximately 209 tons of plastic  no longer required to support our business.

Water is a precious and irreplaceable resource, and many communities are 
water stressed – struggling to balance competing demands for a limited water supply. At Verizon we are doing our part by setting conservation goals and implementing processes to reduce our water consumption.
Verizon established a goal of reducing water consumption by 5 percent over a 
2014 baseline. By 2016 we had met and exceeded that goal, having achieved a reduction of 7 percent. Following that success we twice raised our targets for water conservation. Our current, updated goal is to reduce our water consumption by 15 percent over our 2016 level by 2025.

Verizon has adopted an environmental management system (EMS) 
based on International Standards Organization (ISO) 14001 and achieved certification in some markets, while evaluating implementation across the business. Our EMS provides guidance, instruction and best management practices that exceed regulatory requirements while striving for continuous improvement. In 2018 we updated 7 programs with an environmental focus.
Verizon’s EMS provides a framework for identifying, controlling and 
reducing the risks associated with the environments in which we operate. Besides regular management system assessments, internal and third-party compliance audits and inspections are performed annually at hundreds of facilities worldwide. The goal of these assessments is to identify and correct site-specific items, and to educate and empower facility managers and supervisors to implement corrective actions.
Verizon’s environment, health and safety efforts are directed and supported 
by highly trained and experienced health, safety and environment experts around the world that support our operations and facilities.

The Green T eam is Verizon’s voluntary, grassroots effort that builds sustainability 
into everything we do. In 2018, 27 ,248 employees in 36 countries and territories 
were part of the Green T eam. Green T eam members work to help Verizon reduce our environmental impact at work and to reduce their personal impact at home. Verizon has a public goal of 20 percent of employees participating  
on the Green T eam by 2020. At year-end 2018 we met that goal early, with  
20.4 percent of employees participating, and set a new goal of having  
25 percent of employees on the Green T eam by 2025. 
In 2018, we exceeded our goal to conduct 250 Green T eam events – 
encompassing tree plantings, green space cleanups, beautification projects, recycling events and more.  In March 2018, Verizon observed Earth Hour by offering employees five ways to pledge an hour to the environment throughout the month. This annual event brings together individuals, companies and other organizations to raise awareness around resource use and conservation. Green T eam members  
in 36 countries pledged nearly 14,000 hours in the month of March.
Reforestation initiatives
Verizon established a goal to plant 2 million trees by 2030, and in 2018 we made continued progress toward that objective. In 2018 we sponsored the planting of 156,766 trees, including more than 50,000 trees in areas impacted by the 2017 hurricanes. Since the initiative began in 2009, some 724,550 trees have been planted.

stronger company and cultureV T eam  |  Diversity & Inclusion
Our business is all about connecting people and cultures across the world, 
and using technology to enable people, business and society to innovate and drive positive change. We know we can only fulfill this purpose by building a diverse workforce and inclusive culture where differences are a strength and all people are empowered to grow and contribute – within Verizon, with our customers and among our business partners and suppliers. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is more than the right thing to do – it’s a business imperative and a competitive advantage. By valuing diversity and inclusion across people with different backgrounds and ways of thinking, we build a stronger company and culture.
Verizon’s Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Policy  reinforces 
our commitment to diversity.
 Our commitment to diversity and inclusion encompasses the principle that all employees should be compensated equitably for similar work and should have an equal opportunity to contribute and advance in the workplace. In 2017 , Verizon published its Pay Equity Commitment , our pledge to identify 
and promote best practices in compensation, hiring, promotion and career development; to develop strategies to reduce unconscious bias; and to make hiring, promotion and compensation decisions that promote pay equity. We have removed from employment applications all questions seeking current or past salary information of applicants for employment.We continue to invest in the growth of women and people of color  
on the V T eam. Among our most successful initiatives: 
A seven-month mentorship program that matches senior 
executives and female V T eam members with the goal of advancing leadership skills and development.
A three-month program supporting managers who 
are people of color, fosters leadership development and networking with senior leaders.
In 2018, we expanded the required workshops for our 
leadership team to explore unconscious bias and how to mitigate its impact to create a more inclusive workplace.
We promote diversity and encourage the contribution of diverse business partners to our success through our Short-T erm Incentive Plan, which includes a 5 percent diversity and sustainability metric relating to the percentage of U.S.-based employees who are women and people of color; our overall supplier spending directed to firms owned by women, minorities, veterans, LGBT, and people with disabilities; and reductions in the carbon intensity of our business.40

Verizon is a founding sponsor of Women in T echnology and 
Entrepreneurship in NY (WiTNY) . As a collaborative initiative with 
Cornell T ech, the City University of New York (CUNY), and industry partners 
like Verizon, WiTNY propels women – from high school through graduate school – into rewarding tech careers with programs focused on education, work experience, and community building. We partner on a number of initiatives, including the “winternship” program, three-week internships for college freshmen and sophomores during their winter break. Verizon worked with WiTNY to pilot the winternship in 2017 with five students, and in 2018 WiTNY expanded the program to more than 170 students across 45+ companies. In 2018, Verizon hosted 10 winterns, and nine of them returned to Verizon for summer internships that year. In 2019, Verizon will host an additional 12 winterns across technical functions. Verizon launched adfellows  2.0 in September 2018. adfellows is a program 
for college graduates across the country with diverse backgrounds and an interest in marketing. The eight-month marketing fellowship allows participants to rotate through Verizon and agency partners to gain both client and agency experience and promote diversity in the marketing industry. We achieved a 100 percent graduation rate and an 84 percent full-time retention rate in our first year. In 2018 the initiative expanded to include 30 new adfellows and six new sponsor partners.Recognition and recruiting partnershipsOur success in building a diverse and inclusive culture continues to earn Verizon numerous prestigious awards.

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportStrengthening 
our connections, empowering the V T eamV T eam  |  Employee Resource Groups
T o create and sustain a diverse and inclusive culture, it’s essential that 
we engage and empower our employees so they can fulfill their greatest 
potential. Our global employee resource groups (ERGs) and their members serve as ambassadors of diversity and inclusion. While each ERG has its unique mission, together all work toward four common objectives:
• Career – dynamic programming for employee professional development.
•  Customer – a forum for employees to collaborate to help the company 
deliver great customer experiences in all market segments.
•  Community – outreach to enable economic inclusion for underserved 
communities.
•  Culture – continue to build an inclusive company culture where everyone 
can thrive on their uniqueness and contribute to the business. 
ERGs help the V T eam to value and leverage our differences – and similarities. By collaborating through ERGs, members bring their whole and authentic selves to their work and contribute their unique perspectives. Knowing their voices are heard and their work is valued, they find a strong sense of belonging, helping to drive Verizon’s competitive advantage.
We want every member of the V T eam to bring their best selves and  
feel included at work every day. So, in addition to engaging thousands of 
V T eamers through our ERGs, we strengthened our best practices for a diverse and inclusive culture by expanding the reach of our unconscious bias training. Live workshops and virtual training were implemented, covering all levels of the organization in 2018. As we continue to learn about and discuss the impact of unconscious bias, we will explore opportunities to ensure our policies, practices and systems evolve to reflect that learning. Verizon sponsors nine ERGs: 
• Asian-Pacific Employees for Excellence 
• Black Resource Association of Verizon Employees 
• Disabilities Issues Awareness Leaders 
•  Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and T ransgender Employees of Verizon

Performance & Diversity
Verizon is committed to partnering with our suppliers to better the world 
collaboratively. We use EcoVadis and Avetta, third-party platforms, to assess our suppliers’ corporate responsibility – their safety and environmental performance. Since 2013, we have invited 448 key suppliers to the EcoVadis platform. EcoVadis assesses four key areas: environment, fair labor practices, ethics and fair business practices, and supply chain. EcoVadis combines supplier questionnaire input with public data to benchmark suppliers on their corporate responsibility performance. When weaknesses are identified, Verizon works with the supplier to create a corrective action plan to improve their program. Both Verizon and our suppliers benefit from this program. Verizon’s minimum goal is that 80 percent of the assessed suppliers will complete the EcoVadis assessment by 2020 and receive a passing score. 
Avetta, an external qualifier of supply chain risk, reviews injury rates, environmental 
health and safety violations, fines, corrective actions, and other environment and safety performance metrics for Verizon’s suppliers working in areas most prone to environmental and safety risks. Avetta compares the data to industry benchmarks and, when weaknesses are identified, Verizon works with contractors to review root causes and plan corrective actions. More than 2,500 Verizon contractors have been screened by Avetta. Verizon is also a member of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC), an association of telecom operators that collaboratively audits their common suppliers and looks for opportunities to improve corporate social responsibility across the Information and Communications T echnology industry. JAC supplements Verizon’s supply chain CSR program by investigating suppliers’ actual performance on site to ensure that they are living up to what they pledge in their policies. Since its inception in 2010, JAC has completed 482 on-site supplier audits – 116 in 2018. Verizon joined the group in 2013 as the first U.S.-based member and serves on both the Leadership Assembly and Operational Board. Other members include A T&T, Deutsche T elekom, KPN, Orange, Proximus, Rogers, Swisscom, T elecom Italia, T elefónica, T elenor, T eliaSonera, and Vodafone. Our public goal:

Recognized for strong supplier diversity performance
Verizon has long been a recognized leader for supplier diversity. In 2018, we purchased more than $5 billion in goods and services with diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, veterans, LGBT and

Verizon is a charter member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, a coalition of 28 companies that each spends more than $1 billion every year  with diverse suppliers.We operate a robust set of supplier diversity initiatives that include designed collaboration with executive champions from across our business. This creates opportunities for diverse businesses, advocacy and outreach. You can read more about our supplier diversity program here: verizon.com/about/our-company/supplier-diversity .

Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportGovernance  |  Code of Conduct
As our Credo states: We believe integrity is at the core of who we are. This  
principle governs every aspect of how we run our business, from how our Board of Directors operates to our engagement with stakeholders.
The Code: Safeguarding the integrity of our business
We monitor conflicts of interest and require all employees to complete Verizon Code of Conduct training to safeguard the integrity of our business. 
We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that’s built on our 
Verizon Code of Conduct and includes ongoing educational communications, mandatory training and readily accessible tools. The Verizon Code of Conduct defines how we work. It establishes a set of guidelines aligned with the principles in our Verizon Credo and our core values of Integrity, Respect, Performance Excellence, Accountability and Social Responsibility. The Code helps V T eamers make sound job-related decisions that strengthen our culture of integrity. Compliance with the Code and applicable laws and regulations is expected wherever V T eamers conduct business on behalf of Verizon. All employees must complete required Code training and apply its principles in their work. The Code outlines ethical and legal expectations in a number of areas, including:
• Maintaining an inclusive and healthy work environment
• Maintaining integrity and fairness in the workplace
• Protecting Verizon’s assets and reputation
• Maintaining integrity and fairness in the marketplace
We also continue to share additional compliance and ethics-related communications with V T eamers, including training on privacy and  
information security for all employees. A conflict of interest questionnaire is regularly completed by all Verizon employees at the director level and above, and by employees below the director level in targeted areas of the business. 
An Environment, Health and Safety Attestation is completed each year by 
management showing their commitment to supporting their teams in following  
safe work procedures and environmental requirements for their job.
All V T eamers are encouraged to raise questions, report concerns and acquire any 
additional needed information about our ethics standards. V T eamers are provided with a suite of resources to help them fulfill our commitment to integrity, including:

Our zero-tolerance 
approachGovernance  |  Anti-corruption
Verizon enforces a zero-tolerance policy for unethical business practices, 
including bribery or corruption of any kind. V T eamers in relevant operational roles receive anti-corruption training and communications that clearly articulate our expectations, core principles and zero tolerance for corrupt activities or unethical business practices. Our training, which incorporates practical examples, helps employees understand and comply with various anti-bribery laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
We instruct employees to seek legal approval before giving anything of value 
to a public official. We supplement our general compliance training with targeted communications and in-person instruction on an as-needed basis.
Properly addressing concerns
In 2018, environmental inspections at our facilities resulted in 212 notices from regulatory agencies – 31 more than in 2017 . We attribute the increase to our improved reporting rather than to more incidents because most notices resulted from record keeping or administrative matters in California, not environmental harm. We continue our efforts to prevent environmental harm while taking steps to correct the record keeping.  Stakeholder engagement: connecting with those we serveOur long-standing Consumer Advisory Board (CAB), composed of diverse leading business and public-interest advocates, provides us with an unfiltered view of relevant technology, consumer, business and social issues at twice-yearly meetings. CAB members’ perspectives and advice play a role in the development of many important Verizon policy and business decisions.
We strive to make it easy for our stakeholders to understand our positions and 
progress on issues that matter to them. In pursuit of that goal, we publish: 
•  A semiannual T ransparency Report , listing all the law-enforcement 
requests for customer information that we received in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business as of the publication date; 
•  A semiannual Political Engagement Report , disclosing all of Verizon’s  
PAC contributions, corporate political contributions and support for ballot initiatives, independent expenditures, and listing our public policy organizations’ significant memberships in trade organizations; and 
•  The Verizon Broadband Commitment , which outlines our commitment to 
an open internet that provides consumers with competitive broadband choices and internet access – when, where and how they want it. 5656
Verizon 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportA diverse, independent 
and engaged boardGovernance  |  Corporate Governance & Risk Management
Verizon is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance 
because we believe that good governance is essential to driving success, enhancing our reputation and building long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Our Board of Directors oversees Verizon’s business strategies, risk management, responsible business practices and succession planning with the assistance of four standing committees comprised solely of independent directors. All Board members stand for election annually and, with the exception of the Chairman and CEO, are independent directors. An independent lead director shares governance responsibilities with the Chairman and facilitates forthright communication and effective independent oversight of management’s performance.  
Board diversity and refreshment  
We believe that good governance starts with an independent, engaged 
and diverse Board. In 2018, one-third of our board members were women and nearly half were Hispanic or African American. Verizon’s commitment to board refreshment is central to ensuring that the composition of our Board evolves along with our strategic needs for the future. The Board’s Corporate Governance and Policy Committee  regularly evaluates 
director skill sets to ensure the optimal combination of expertise is represented on the Board. In the last seven years, seven new independent directors have been elected to the Board, and the Corporate Governance and Policy Committee continues to actively oversee the recruitment of additional directors to ensure that this refreshment process continues. Overseeing strategyOur Board is vigilant in the oversight of Verizon’s long-term strategy. At each Board meeting, Directors engage our senior leaders in robust discussions about Verizon’s strategic goals. It is with our corporate strategy and business priorities in mind that the Human Resources Committee  determines the 
appropriate compensation structures and levels for our senior leaders to incentivize them to achieve these goals. T o ensure Verizon has the financial ability to execute on our strategic plan, the Finance Committee  
monitors Verizon’s capital needs and financing plans. In addition, in order gain a broader perspective on the environment in which Verizon competes, our directors participate in numerous activities outside the boardroom, including regular education sessions on topics central to the industry. 
Overseeing risk 
We view Board oversight of Verizon’s risk profile – in its strategic activity, business operations and deployment of capital – as fundamental to the well-being of our Company. Our directors ensure that Verizon’s risk management policies and procedures are consistent with the Company’s strategy and risk appetite, that these policies and procedures are effective and functioning as directed, and that management is fostering a culture of risk-aware decision making throughout the organization. Verizon has a robust, formalized business risk management reporting process that is overseen by the Audit Committee  
and designed to provide visibility to the Board on critical risks and risk mitigation strategies. The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee  oversees 
Verizon’s handling of business and reputational risks relating to Verizon’s position and engagement on important public policy issues, including political contributions, lobbying, corporate social responsibility and sustainability, as well as individual events and incidents that may affect the Company’s reputation. Our Board also regularly receives briefings on cybersecurity, privacy, product-related risks and “lessons learned” from completed mergers and acquisitions. 5757

Overseeing responsible business practices We believe that a corporation that is purposefully operating at the intersection of economic, environmental and social accountability creates greater long-term value for its shareholders. In 2018, Verizon established a new management body called the Verizon Responsible Business Council , chaired by the CEO, 
to oversee the integration of responsible practices into our business as a core operating principle. The Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer reports on the Council’s activities to the full Board at least annually.
Overseeing succession planning and leadership development 
Our Board recognizes that one of its most important duties is to oversee the development of executive talent and ensure continuity in Verizon’s senior leadership, as well as the efficient succession of the CEO. The Human Resources Committee  takes the lead in overseeing succession planning  
and assignments to key leadership positions, and regularly reports to the full Board during executive sessions. Our Board conducts an annual in-depth  review of senior leader development and succession planning to assure that  
our processes support Verizon’s strategic objectives. In 2018, the appointment  
of Hans Vestberg as CEO of Verizon was the culmination of a deliberate  
and thoughtful multi-year planning process.

T o support our efforts to operate with respect for human rights, Verizon 
launched the Business & Human Rights Program (BHRP) in 2018. This Program, which is based on an initiative created ten years ago at Yahoo (prior to its acquisition by Verizon), strives to enhance our human rights due diligence by embedding human rights considerations into responsible business decision-making processes across the company.  
The BHRP is characterized by executive commitment and a dedicated 
BHRP team, supported by partners throughout the business, working to perform assessments of the human rights impacts of business decisions. This work is informed by engagement with external networks and experts from around the globe in the field of business and human rights.
