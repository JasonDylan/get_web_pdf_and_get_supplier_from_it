Responsibility 
Report 2002  
  
 
 Stockholm 15 April, 2003  
 
  
 
Dear Reader,   
The journey towards the publication of this report has been one of insight and learning. The 
process has highlighted areas where we sometimes exceeded our own expectations, but also areas where we were just simply not yet up to the mark. 
 
The reader of this report should see it as a first attempt to make H&M’s commitment to sustainability understandable for a wide group of stakeholders. For the first time we publish our CSR vision and our objectives for the implementation of H&M’s Code of Conduct in our 
supply chain. We also publish our main environmental aspects as well as our environmental 
objectives and targets. By primarily describing our processes, we hope to visualise for the reader H&M’s approach to CSR.  
One of our objectives for reporting on CSR has been to create a base for improvement of 
our performance. A concrete example is that while evaluating our work in 2002 we have realised that less factory re-inspections than expected were unannounced. Such insights 
help us to develop targets and action plans for specific areas of improvement where we find 
that our work is not meeting our ambitions. The internal benefits of the measures and reporting should not be underestimated.  
H&M’s approach to CSR has a strong focus on the supply chain. While we recognise the 
importance of taking responsibility for our own actions, we feel that we can bring about the most significant changes towards sustainability in the production of our garments. H&M is 
committed to the Global Compacts nine principles and to the OECD guidelines for 
multinational enterprises. In this report we try to clarify how we have interpreted our role in the promotion of each principle and guideline, with emphasis on our supply chain.   
H&M is a financially strong company which is expanding quickly in existing and new 
markets. We understand that to continue to do so, we have to maintain the trust in our brand from our customers, employees, and investors. It is our belief that our long-term voluntary commitment to CSR will help us to earn that trust.   
 
 Sincerely Yours, 
 
 
 
 Ingrid Schullström  
Manager, Environment & CSR

 CEO-statement 
 
As a major international company, H&M has a social 
responsibility. It is important that we have good 
relations with the world around us and take 
responsibility for how people and the environment are 
affected by our activities. 
  Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has high priority 
within H&M and the department that is responsible for 
the environment and social responsibility reports 
directly to me. This enables me to keep a close track 
on this important work. Our employees have also 
demonstrated great commitment to these matters and 
during the year we introduced training of sales staff in 
CSR matters.  
 
  
 
 
These types of issues require cooperation and 
dialogue with many different interested parties around 
the world. We run our own projects as well as 
cooperating with industry colleagues and international 
organisations. H&M also supports the UN Global 
Compact. In so doing we want to signify that we respect human rights and are prepared to contribute 
to sustainable development within the areas that we 
are able to influence.  
 
By publishing this report, we genuinely want to 
demonstrate to our stakeholders our commitment to 
CSR as well as our successes and shortcomings within 
this field.  
 
    
Our Philosophy 
 
Our business concept is to give the customer unbeatable value 
by offering fashion and quality at the best price. H&M’s concept of quality means that customers must be satisfied with both our products and with H&M as a company. Rolf EriksenCSR Report 2002 
 
CSR Vision and Strategy 
 
H&M’s CSR-vision is: 
 
To uphold Human Rights, contribute to Sustainable 
Development and thereby earn trust from our 
Stakeholders. 
 
H&M’s general strategy is to continue to grow whilst 
maintaining good profitability. H&M also believes that 
good relations with the world around and long-term 
profitability depend on H&M taking responsibility for how people and the environment are affected by our 
activities. 
 
The following quote from our environmental policy 
very well concludes the general strategy that H&M has 
on Corporate Social Responsibility:  
 
“Continuous improvements are significant for all H&M 
activities. This includes our environmental and social 
efforts, which are conducted within the framework of 
our business operations. H&M's business concept is to 
give our customers unsurpassed value by offering fashion and quality at the best price. Our quality 
concept is based on ensuring that our customers are 
satisfied with our products and H&M as a company. To 
this end, we are committed to acting responsibly in 
our community. We shall also co-operate with our 
suppliers to improve the social and environmental 
standards in the factories that manufacture H&M 
clothing, thereby contributing to sustainable 
development in these areas.” 
CSR as defined by H&M 
 
H&M has chosen to define CSR as “a concept whereby companies 
integrate social and environmental concern in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a 
voluntary basis in order to meet or exceed the ethical, legal, 
commercial and public expectations that society has of business”.  Main Responsibility Aspects 
 
H&M has identified a number of aspects that we 
consider our main responsibility in the area of CSR. 
The aspects are what we consider most pressing 
within our business. 
 
Social Aspects 
 
Working conditions, Labour standards and 
Human Rights 
 
H&M does not own or operate any factories of its own. 
We are doing business with approximately 900 
suppliers, who in turn use subcontractors. 2771 
production units1 around the world manufacture our 
goods. Based on our experience, it is necessary to 
work closely with our suppliers on issues such as 
working conditions, compensation and benefits, 
working hours, non-discrimination, health and safety, 
to mention a few, in order to make sure that nobody, 
whose work is contributing to our success, is deprived 
of his or her human rights, or suffers mental or bodily 
                                    
1 This term is used to describe factories producing clothes for 
H&M, whether it is a supplier’s factory or a subcontractor’s 
factory. harm. The Code of Conduct also makes it clear that 
under no circumstances will H&M accept child labour, 
forced labour or discrimination amongst employees. 
All the suppliers who produce H&M's products must 
sign an agreement in which they undertake to adhere 
to our Code of Conduct. H&M's production offices have 
full-time inspectors who make regular inspections of 
our suppliers and their subcontractors to check that 
the requirements of the Code of Conduct are being respected. Should the inspectors find any 
shortcomings in this respect, an action plan is drawn 
up together with the supplier. Re-inspections ensure 
that improvements are made. As a last resort, if the 
supplier does not implement the agreed 
improvements, the co-operation with the supplier may 
be terminated. 
 
Environmental, Health, and Safety 
Aspects 
 
Anyone who uses, works with, or in any other way 
comes in contact with our products must feel 
absolutely sure that there is no risk of being exposed to, for example, hazardous chemicals, sharp objects 
or easily flammable fabrics. Therefore H&M is devoted 
to work hard with product quality and safety. 
 Product quality and safety 
 
H&M have a high standard of product safety and 
quality. There are extra safety requirements for baby 
and children's products. 17 H&M laboratories are 
located in the production countries and approximately 
110 quality controllers and their daily presence in the 
factories ensure that the quality and safety 
requirements are met.  
Restricted Substances in our products 
 
All our suppliers of goods have signed agreements to 
abide by established chemical restrictions. In this 
way, we contribute to the reduction of environmental 
harm throughout the production of our goods as well 
as during the burning and recycling of worn out 
clothing. Our chemical restrictions are continuously 
updated, with new substances being added on a 
regular basis. Our restrictions concern chemicals used 
in the production of clothing as well as cosmetics. 
 The environmental impact in the supply chain 
 
The most substantial environmental effects occur in 
the dying of fabrics and processing of fibres - stages 
of production that take place before the assembly of 
H&M's clothing begins. In our experience, there is a 
need of more environmentally friendly operations in 
order to achieve sustainable development. H&M has 
initiated a pilot project
 to increase environmental 
consciousness in the early stages of production. Our 
experiences with this project will lay the groundwork 
for plans to reduce our suppliers' manufacturing 
effects on the environment. 
 
Transportation - environmental considerations 
 
Transportation of goods, although not operated by 
H&M, stands for almost 40% of total carbon dioxide 
emissions caused by H&M operations. Therefore, it is 
vital for H&M, in cooperation with our transporters 
and service providers, to try to achieve more 
environmentally friendly transports. For the 2nd 
consecutive year, a comprehensive enquiry to our 
transportation service providers about their environmental performance has been completed. 
From January 2003 we have a set of minimum 
environmental requirements for road transports. 
  Respect for nature and sustainable resource use 
in our shops and distribution centres 
 
H&M operates 844 shops and 13 distribution centres 
(DC's). In order to optimise resource use, every 
decision with an environmental bearing demands 
careful consideration bearing in mind the size of our 
operations. We therefore endeavour to reduce 
consumption and increase recycling of packaging, hangers, decorative materials, disposable materials 
etc.  
 
Major themes of sustainable development 
 
Related to the major themes of sustainable 
development, this report just briefly covers human 
resource management, stakeholder management, and 
corporate governance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Value Added 
 
Major Products and services 
 
At H&M, everyone is working towards the same goal – 
giving the customer unbeatable value through the 
combination of fashion, quality and price. H&M’s 
concept of quality means that customers must be 
satisfied with both our products and with H&M as a 
company. We have therefore undertaken to act 
responsibly towards the society in which we are 
active.   
 
We have a wide range of products and new goods are 
delivered to our stores every day. To make things clearer for our customers, we have divided the range 
into a number of different concepts. We offer fashion 
basics as well as clothes with high fashion content 
within each collection, so that customers can easily 
combine different garments and find their own 
personal style. This allows customers to choose from 
a wide range – from updated classics to the trendiest 
garments, from newborn baby to fully- grown adult. 
Our stores are designed to allow customers to make 
their own choices easily. The aim is to create a 
comfortable and inspiring atmosphere in the store 
that makes it simple for customers to find what they want and to feel at home. It is important to provide 
customers with ideas and inspiration, so that they can 
choose what suits their own style. We do this through 
our garment displays and mannequins that provide 
inspiration for matching and styling tips.  
 
H&M has been selling cosmetics since 1975. Today 
H&M sells cosmetics in Scandinavia, Germany, the UK, 
Austria, and Spain. H&M places great emphasis on having a fashionable, good value range of high quality 
products with a high fashion content. The product 
range now includes hair care and body care, make-up 
and accessories for men and women.  
 
Since 1980 H&M has offered its customers an 
alternative and convenient way of shopping by mail 
order. This business is managed by H&M Rowells. 
Here, again, the aim is to provide fashion and quality 
at the best price. Mail order shopping is currently 
available in Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark.  
 
In 1998 H&M began its shopping online service, when 
e-commerce was first started as a test activity in 
Sweden. In 1999, the activity was extended to Denmark and Finland and in 2001, our online shop 
expanded to Norway. H&M’s Purchasing Processes 
 
Suppliers 
 
H&M does not have any factories of its own, but 
instead works with around 900 suppliers. Around 50 
percent of the production takes place in Europe and 
the rest mainly in Asia. We make an effort to co-
operate only with suppliers meeting a number of 
requirements in respect to compliance with our Code 
of Conduct, quality, capacity and punctual deliveries 
to mention a few of the most important ones. H&M 
endeavours to bring about long-term relationships 
with suppliers. Continuous co-operation with our 
suppliers helps us to ensure that our requirements are met. 
 
Production offices 
 
In order to be able to follow up production, H&M has 
21 production offices in Europe, Asia, and Africa with 
nearly 600 people employed. The tasks of any 
production office are for example to develop each 
buying market, order-placement, to control all 
production and to make sure that the supplier is 
following H&M’s instructions. This means making sure 
that all orders are placed with the right supplier, that 
the goods are produced at the right price, are of good 
quality, and to checking that our Code of Conduct is 
followed. 
 
  
 
 
 H&M IN BRIEF 
 
 
/Gd8/G20H&M was established in Sweden in 1947. 
/Gd8/G20Today H&M sells clothes and cosmetics in more 
than 844 stores in 14 countries. We plan to open 110 new stores and to close 7 stores in 2003. 
/Gd8/G20The business concept is “Fashion and quality at 
the best price”. 
/Gd8/G20H&M has around 90 designers who work with a 
team made up of 50 pattern designers, 100 buyers and a number of budget controllers to 
create H&M’s clothin
g collections for women, men, 
children and teenagers. 
/Gd8/G20H&M also sells cosmetics under its own brand. 
/Gd8/G20H&M sells over half a billion items a year and new 
goods are delivered to our stores every day. 
/Gd8/G20In Scandinavia H&M Rowells sells fashion by mail 
order. 
/Gd8/G20In Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland H&M 
sells fashion via the Internet. 
/Gd8/G20H&M does not have any factories of its own, but 
instead works with around 900 suppliers. Around 
half of production takes place in Europe and the rest mainly in Asia.  
/Gd8/G20H&M has 21 production offices around the world – 
ten in Europe, ten in Asia and one in Africa. 
/Gd8/G20The group has more than 39,000 employees. 
/Gd8/G20The turnover in 2002 was 53,332 million SEK. 
 Distribution 
 
Every stage in the chain, starting with the transport 
from the supplier, is controlled by H&M, acting as 
importer and wholesaler as well as retailer. Once the 
garments are ready, they are distributed to H&M's 
stores via distribution centres. Every sales country 
(with the exception of Luxembourg, which is served 
by Belgium) has a distribution centre where the clothes are checked and, if necessary, steam-ironed 
before being sent on to the stores. Having few links 
and as few stops as possible in the distribution chain 
makes the supply of goods efficient. H&M sells more 
than half a billion items a year.

 Governance Structure and Management 
Systems 
 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ WORK 
 
The Parent Company Board of Directors met seven 
times during the financial year. Stefan Persson was 
re-elected Chairman of the Board at a Board Meeting 
following election and the Board adopted a working 
arrangement for themselves. This calls for them to 
hold five ordinary meetings annually, the Board meeting following election not included. It also 
stipulates that the Board of Directors shall decide on 
the Group financing policy, investments and 
disinvestments in companies and activities, as well as 
new markets. The Board of Directors have kept 
abreast of the financial development and position of 
the Group. No special committees were appointed.  
 
Severance pay 
 
The managing Director of the Parent Company is 
entitled to one year’s notice. In the event the 
company cancels the employment contract, the 
Managing Director shall receive, in excess of 12 
months’ notice, an additional year’s salary as part of the severance pay. There are no other agreements 
regarding severance pay in the Group. 
 
Terms of employment for other Group senior 
executive officers 
 
In accordance with decision at the Annual General 
Meeting, remuneration to the Board of Directors 
reached SEK 3,900,000 (3,900,000), of which SEK 2,700,000 (3,000,000) was paid to the Chairman of 
the Board. Board members employed by the company 
were not compensated. Remuneration to the 
Managing Director in the form of salary and benefits 
amounted to SEK 7,621,000, of which bonus SEK 
1,500,000 (last year 4,775,000. No bonus was paid). 
The usual premium for a Swedish ITP retirement plan 
should be added to the aforementioned figures. 
Remuneration to other Group management in the 
form of salary and benefits amounted to SEK 
14,663,000, of which bonus SEK 1,500,000. Certain 
executives who are entitled to retire between the ages 
of 60 and 62 receive retirement payments. The cost of 
these payments has been covered by separate 
insurance policies.   Bonus system 
 
The Managing Director, country managers2, and 
certain senior executives are included in a bonus 
system. The size of the bonus is based on 0.2% of the 
increase in the ordinary dividend decided by the 
Annual General Meeting, which is then adjusted to 
take account of the result in their respective areas of 
the business. The maximum bonus per person and year has been set at SEK 500,000. In the case of the 
Managing Director the bonus is 0.6% of the dividend 
increase, up to a maximum of SEK 1,500,000. The 
bonus paid after tax must be invested in its entirety in 
shares in the company, which must be held for a 
minimum of five years.
                                   
 
2 The Country Manager is managing one of our sales countries. External factors influencing H&M 
 
H&M faces various external risks in its business. A 
number of these can be dealt with by well-developed 
internal routines, while others are largely determined 
by external factors. 
 
Fashion 
 Working in the fashion industry is a risk in itself. 
Fashion is a perishable item and there is always a risk 
that some of the collections will not be well received 
by customers. Within each concept H&M must have 
the right volumes and achieve the right balance in the 
mix between fashion basics and the goods with a high 
fashion content that are so important for H&M’s 
image. To reduce the fashion risk H&M is 
systematically working on reducing lead times from 
the idea until the finished product is in the store. 
Production of clothing with high fashion content is also 
increasingly being commissioned in Europe, where 
lead times are shorter. This allows production to be 
adapted to customer demand more quickly. H&M 
trades in 14 countries on two continents. Although purchasing patterns are relatively similar in the 
various markets, differences do occur. The start of the 
season varies between countries, for example, as 
does the length of the season. Consequently, both the delivery date and the volume of goods for the 
different stores must be adjusted to match. In Spain, 
for example, autumn comes later and is considerably 
shorter than in Scandinavia. 
 
The weather 
 
H&M’s goods are bought and launched in stores on the 
basis of a normal weather situation, for example assuming that autumn will arrive when it should 
according to the statistics and will maintain a certain 
temperature. Major departures from the norm will 
affect sales. The biggest effect is felt if there are 
major departures at the beginning of a season. 
 
The economic cycle 
 
In 2002 a number of major economies experienced 
slower economic growth and generally weaker 
demand. It is difficult to know how an economic 
downturn will affect H&M’s sales, but historically it has 
emerged that H&M does not tend to see any 
significant reduction in sales when there is a downturn 
in the economic cycle. 
 Currency hedging 
 
The most significant purchase currency for the Group 
are the US dollar and related currencies. Fluctuations 
in the dollar/euro exchange rates form the largest 
individual transaction exposure within the Group. To 
hedge against fluctuations in the dollar rate and thus 
reduce the effects of future exchange rate 
fluctuations, the US dollar and related currencies are secured under forward contracts on an ongoing basis 
throughout the year. Since the sole aim of this 
currency management is to reduce risk, only actual 
exposure is hedged. In addition to the transaction 
exposure arising from purchases in foreign currencies, 
the Group is affected by currency fluctuations as a 
result of the receivables and liabilities that arise on an 
ongoing basis between Group companies. The 
introduction of the euro has reduced this exposure 
somewhat. The majority of the remaining risk is 
hedged through forward contracts. 
 
 
Translation effects 
 
In addition to the effects of transaction exposure, the Group’s result is also affected by translation effects. 
These arise when a foreign subsidiary’s profit/loss is 
converted into Swedish kronor in order to be consolidated in the Group accounts. The underlying 
profit/loss in each market may be unchanged, but 
then either reduced or increased when converted into 
Swedish kronor. Translation effects also arise in 
respect of the Group’s net assets on consolidation of 
the foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets. No equity 
hedging is carried out for this risk. 
 
Liquidity management  
Liquid surplus funds are invested short-term in banks 
or in government securities in the local currency of 
the company in question. The Group does not utilise 
any derivative instruments in the interest-bearing 
securities market. The Group does not trade in shares 
or similar instruments. 
 Stakeholder Engagement 
 
H&M recognizes the need of interacting and having a 
dialogue with its various stakeholders. Every day we 
learn more about CSR-issues and concerns in our 
meetings with our stakeholders and in other forum. 
When making use of this knowledge and information 
that has been worked up, it is at times difficult to 
communicate what stakeholder information led to 
what decision. More important is of course that our 
stakeholders are comfortable with our plans, 
achievements, and progress. During 2003, we will 
look more thoroughly into our interactions with our 
stakeholders.  
 Furthermore, H&M, through its CSR-organisation, is 
kept up to date in the CSR-area through various 
channels such as newsletters
, seminars, and 
memberships  of different kinds. The subsequent 
stakeholder events have been of importance in our 
dealings with supply chain issues. 
 
Master’s Theses on Stakeholder Management 
 
In 2002, H&M funded a Master’s Theses that 
examined current practises on how to manage 
stakeholders who are situated in different parts of the 
world. The underlying assumption for this Master’s 
Theses was that stakeholders in our sales countries, 
(e.g. our customers and staff), have concerns that do not correspond with the concerns of stakeholders in 
our production countries (e.g. the textile workers). 
Our customers for example, are concerned about the 
presence of child labour in the garment production 
whereas the textile workers are concerned about 
attaining higher wages. 
 
The conclusions of the Theses gave us input about: 
 
/Gd8/G20What stakeholders to include in a consultation. 
/Gd8/G20The need to compare and consider the influence 
of our stakeholders and the practical 
consequences of this comparison. 
/Gd8/G20Our stakeholders’ various concerns and 
priorities and how to deal with the differences. 
 
 
Stakeholder Dialogue 
 
During the spring of 2001 H&M took part in a 
Stakeholder dialogue. Nine other companies 
participated. The stakeholder dialogue consisted of 
three parts, the keynote speeches, the workshops, 
and formal, as well as informal, individual meetings 
between corporations and organizations. Participating 
in this dialogue were representatives from, ECPAT, 
Amnesty International Business Forum, ATTAC, 
Friends of the Earth, Fair Trade Centre to mention a 
few.  
 The Dress Code Project  
 
In May 2001, the DressCode Project was concluded 
with a report describing the outcomes of the project. 
The purpose of the project was amongst other things 
to enable H&M to secure effective independent 
verification of H&M's monitoring program. The 
DressCode Project is a very good example of our 
various stakeholders coming together to address their concerns and share their knowledge.  
 
Although this particular proposal for independent 
verification has not been implemented, H&M still 
supports the idea.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Human Resources  
 
At the end of the year, H&M had around 39,000 
employees. The average number of employees was 
25,674 (converted into full-time positions), 19 per 
cent of whom were male. Net employment creation 
has been 16% on average the last five years. The 
chart below illustrates this as well as yearly job net 
creation.

Constantly finding new staff around the world while at 
the same time retaining and communicating the particular spirit of H&M on which the company is 
based is a major challenge. 
 The spirit of H&M 
 
The spirit of H&M is based on a number of values 
which describe in simple terms how we want to work. 
These values are the foundation of our business 
concept – fashion and quality at the best price. 
 
The spirit of H&M is based on common sense, taking 
own initiatives, believe in people, direct communication, cost consciousness, team work, fast 
pace and continual improvement always with the 
focus on the customer. Within H&M we provide room 
for people to make their own decisions and take 
responsibility and staff get continual feedback on their 
performance. 
 
Since we are constantly opening stores in new 
countries, our employees also have opportunity to 
work in different countries. This creates understanding 
across boundaries and increased commitment. Our 
internal newspaper H&M News is one of a number of 
tools in which we communicate and strengthen the 
corporate culture as well as updating our staff on 
what is going on within the Group. 
 Recruitment 
 
At H&M we principally recruit internally. External 
recruitment is used primarily for sales staff for our 
stores. These later form a good recruitment base for 
positions of responsibility both in the stores and in 
other functions within the company. That way we 
ensure that the spirit of H&M is spread throughout the 
organisation, whilst at the same time giving our employees opportunity to develop continuously.

Attracting and retaining competent staff is important 
for our success. We therefore work continually on 
developing skills. The biggest knowledge gain is made 
through active learning in everyday work and all 
training is carried out within our own organisation. 
Newly employed store staff undergoes a three-week 
induction programme in which the emphasis is on  
passing on experience and skills. Each new member of 
staff is given a mentor. They then have continual 
training as needed, for example in customer care, 
textiles, and display. The induction programme 
guarantees that everyone has a basic knowledge in 
H&M’s way of working. We also carry out 
management training in which we place great 
emphasis on being a good communicator of H&M’s 
values. 
 
Organisation 
 
H&M’s head office is in Stockholm. In addition to the 
company management this is also where the main 
functions for buying and design, finance, expansion, shop fitting and display, advertising, communications 
and Public Relations, human resources, CSR, logistics 
and IT are located. AVERAGE NUMBER OF

Main aspects 
 
From a life cycle perspective, the most substantial 
environmental effects occur in the dying of fabrics and 
processing of fibers - stages of production that take 
place before the assembly of H&M's clothing begins. 
In our experience, there is a need of more 
environmentally friendly operations in order to 
achieve sustainable development. H&M have initiated 
a pilot project to increase environmental 
consciousness in the early stages of production as 
well. Our experiences with this project will lay down 
the groundwork for plans to reduce our suppliers' 
manufacturing affects on the environment. 
 
Transportation of goods, although not operated by 
H&M, represents approximately close to 40% of total emissions caused by H&M operations. From January 
2003 we have a set of minimum environmental 
requirements for road transports.  H&M’s Environmental Policy
 
Continuous improvements are significant for all H&M 
activities. This includes our environmental effort, which is conducted within the framework of our business operations. H&M's business concept is to give our customers unsurpassed value by offering fashion and 
quality at the best price. Our quality conce pt is based on 
ensuring that our customers are satisfied with our products and H&M as a company.  To this end, we are committed to acting responsibly in our community. We shall also co-operate with our suppliers to improve the social and environmental standards in the factories that manufacture H&M clothing, thereby contributing to sustainable development in these areas. To achieve this goal, H&M has adopted the following principles. 
 
We shall:  - always consider the health and safety of our employees. By adopting the precautionary principle, we will continuously update our restrictions against the use of environmentally and health hazardous chemicals in the production of our garments and other products.  - continuously update ourselves on environmental news and legislation. We will not be content to follow existing environmental 
 legislation, but will in certain areas do more than the 
law requires.  - conduct our business in a manner that utilises natural resources as efficiently as possible.  - develop new and continuously improve existing environmental requirements concerning the purchase of products and services.  - train, inform and motivate our employees to 
participation and responsibility, thereby making 
environmental work an integrated part of H&M daily routines.  - specify for our suppliers our position regarding behaviour towards the environment and human rights and follow up to ensure that our suppliers improve their 
operations according to these requirements. Environmental Impact Assessment 
 
Two studies have examined the environmental impact 
of H&M’s activities: 
 
/Gd8/G20In 2000, we mapped out the environmental 
impact of the decisions affecting the shops. In 
addition, an action plan for improvement was 
created. 
 
/Gd8/G20In 2001-2002, one minor field study on a pair of 
cotton trousers was conducted that resulted in 
two Life Cycle analyses: “From the cradle to the 
gate” and “From cotton to clothes”. The authors 
have collected their raw data from the same field study but have produced two separate 
Master of Science theses. 
 
The Environmental Impact Assessment has been 
developed in-house. It is an environmental impact 
estimation produced by two experts, one with decades 
of experience in the textile business, and one with the 
environmental knowledge.  
 Coverage of Targets for 2003 and Business Partner Requirements  
 
In addition to the environmental impact assessment 
illustrated in the next page, we also illustrate, through 
colours, in what environmental area we impose 
purchase requirements on our business partners.  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
Furthermore, we place each environmental target for 
2003 (for detailed targets, see the chapter 
Environmental Targets 2003 ) in the environmental 
area where it belongs.

 Environmental Im pact Assessment Environmental Management 
 
H&M´s Environmental organisation  
 
H&M’s Corporate Social Responsibility Manager(CSR), 
environmental responsibility incorporated, is part of 
the management and reports directly to our Managing 
Director. The Environmental Co-ordinator coordinates 
environmental activities at H&M. H&M has 
environmental representatives for the following 
corporate functions: Building, Advertising, Buying, Travel, Logistics, Rowells, Cosmetic, Computer, and 
Design. Every production office and every sales office 
also have their environmental representatives. There 
are 34 environmental representatives in total. 
 
Certification 
 
H&M is not ISO14001-certified. Our customers do not 
call for certification as such. Hence, no value is added 
with it. Nevertheless, we consider it important with a 
systematic work on environmental issues that is a 
natural part of our everyday work.  
 
Environmental evaluation of Transportation 
Service Providers  
Since 2001 the Transportation Service Providers are 
evaluated on a variety of environmental issues in 
order to improve their environmental performance.  From The 1st of January 2003, we have the following 
minimum environmental requirements for companies 
performing goods transports on road. However, 
whether our Transportation Service Providers fulfil 
these requirements or not will not be evaluated until 
the end of 2003.

Introduction 
 
H&M has a responsibility towards the community to 
take responsibility for the environmental impact of our 
operations. It is our ambition to make our suppliers aware of the importance of improving the production 
processes in the entire supply chain. Through the 
requirements in our Code of Conduct, we make clear 
that environmental laws must be followed and that 
the supplier must possess all required permits. 
However, through the SEMS
3 project we move forward 
and in so doing further contribute to the reduction of 
the environmental impact of the production of our 
products.  
 
Strategy 
 
We have decided to use education and inspiration as 
our premier tools to achieve our goal. We do not 
believe that only strict regulation and inspections will give the desired effect. Furthermore, the authorities in 
many of the countries where H&M's garments are 
                                   
 
3 SEMS – Supplier Environmental Motivation Strategy  produced do not monitor or audit the compliance of 
laws and regulations. For all of the reasons above, it 
is essential that our suppliers see the importance and 
the advantages to take their own responsibility. To 
achieve this, we want to educate our suppliers, and 
work with them towards long-term gradual 
improvement. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The Project Status 
 
In this project, four vertical factories (i.e. factory with 
all the wet processes in house) are taking part. The 
suppliers’ factories are located in Indonesia, India, 
Turkey, and Portugal. They participate voluntarily in 
the project. 
 
The first step, which has been finalized, was to perform an initial environmental review (IER). The IER 
focused on the environmental aspects of activities in 
the factories and graded the aspects due to their 
significance. Finally, suggestions on improvements 
were given.  
 
The next step was for the supplier to set 
environmental targets, based on the IER, to improve 
their environmental performance. A designated person 
is required to take responsibility for the targets and a 
time frame must be set. At this stage, the targets are 
set for three out of four suppliers. One of these 
suppliers has already been evaluated thanks to that 
the targets were set at an earlier stage.  
 Furthermore, we have already learned that the pilot 
suppliers are motivated to make improvements on 
their environmental practice that goes beyond the 
law.   
The improvements are focused on resource use where the producer benefits environmentally and 
economically. The achievements often concerns 
energy saving where isolation of pipes, reuse of 
steam, and heat exchangers are some examples. Also 
changes in the processes means sometimes that 
chemicals that are more efficient are introduced and 
consequently less auxiliary chemicals and water are 
needed. By using the counter current flow principles in 
non-sensitive parts of the processes; reuse of water 
and heat can be attained. Some processes can 
become more efficient through cutting the resource 
use. For example, through precise control of the processes, chemicals and heat in surplus can be 
minimized and excluded. This changes often also 
leads to better quality of the products since the 
production process become more even.  
 
The project will be completely evaluated during 2003. 
Next step is to determine how the knowledge 
accumulated in the project should be spread to other 
suppliers.
 
  
 
 
 Communication of Environmental 
information to employees 
 
Our environmental information is communicated through a number of different channels, in order to 
reach all of our employees. Here are some examples: 
 
/Gd8/G20H&M's intranet 
/Gd8/G20H&M's website at internet (www.hm.com/csr ) 
/Gd8/G20H&M's personnel magazine (H&M News)

1. Obtainment of data  
 
Ø 2001: 86% accurate  
Ø 2002: 89% accurate  
 
The inaccuracy is about absence of data or old data.  Included in the Carbon Dioxide and Energy 
figures are:

3. Energy sources  
 
In cases when the information on energy sources is 
missing, assumptions have been made. The data quality in this regard has 98% accuracy.

 Conclusions 
 
There is an 8% increase in Carbon Dioxide Emissions 
2002 compared to 2001. However, as the diagram 
above shows, there is a relative decrease compared to 
last year when measured against turnover. This 
relative decrease is due to mainly two things: The 
fulfilment of our goal to exchange spotlights from 50W 
to 35W and the decrease of business travel by central functions in Stockholm. 
 
Energy use 
 
Energy use is a major cost for H&M and as such 
constantly monitored throughout the organisation. 
However we are currently not systematically working 
with energy use as an environmental aspect and thus 
we do not report this indicator this year.   Environmental aspects currently not 
measured 
 
Water 
 
As described in our impact assessment, emissions to 
water and use of water is a significant aspect in the 
production of the garment and in the use of the garment. For shops, offices and warehouses, the use 
of water is for sanitary needs. Due to the complexity 
of collecting and aggregating the data, we have 
decided not to measure use of and emissions to water 
in our supply chain (production) or in the use of our 
products.  
 
NOx and SOx  
 
NOx and SOx are emissions mostly related to 
transports. Evaluating features like motor type and 
fuel type is at this point too complex to handle. 
Nevertheless, we are in this regard trying to cut the 
emissions from our transportation service providers 
trough our minimum requirements on motor type and fuel type.  
 
 Waste Management 
 
As described in our impact assessment solid waste is 
a significant aspect in our stores and at our DC’s. The 
waste situation in our shops differs depending on the 
sales country. In Norway, for example, more than  
80 % of the shops are referred to the waste handling 
system of the shopping centre/landlord. In USA, on 
the other hand, more than 60% have a separate contract with a waste handling company. In Germany, 
more than 60% of the waste is sent back to H&M’s 
warehouse. Due to the mentioned complexity, it is 
quite difficult for us to measure waste in total figures 
and the amounts in each separated fraction and their 
respective reuse or destination.  
 
Green House Gas emissions in use and disposal 
 
It is not feasible, being a company mainly selling 
garments, to measure the emissions generated by use 
and disposal of the product. Neither would it be 
feasible to measure the emissions caused by our 
supply chain. Just sewing and assembling of garments 
employs 2771 production units. These production units lack the possibilities of collecting and reporting 
any reliable figures

Social ResponsibilitySupply Chain Management 
and Code of Conduct 
 
Introduction to our Code of Conduct work 
 
“H&M, as a strongly expanding multinational 
company, feels that it is increasingly important for us to take responsibility for all our actions, in Europe as 
well as in the rest of the world. Most importantly, we 
have a responsibility towards all the thousands of 
people taking part in the production of our garments. 
We have to make sure that nobody, whose work is 
contributing to our success, is deprived of his or her 
human rights, or suffers mental or bodily harm.” 
The above quote is from our Code of Conduct and is a 
good summary of why we at H&M are working with 
these issues. The UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles 
and Rights at Work form the basis for this Code of 
Conduct. In 1997 we published our Code of Conduct 
and in 1998 we made our first inspections. Since then 
we have made around 8000 inspections.  
 
We have learned a lot and continuously we have 
improved our monitoring and enforcement program.   
Improved conditions 
 
The improvements, since the start of our monitoring 
program, are substantial. The workers can today feel 
much more protected concerning fire safety. More 
often than before they receive a correct pay check 
every month at level or above the minimum wage. 
The working conditions in general have gotten better and cleanliness, ventilation, heat and sanitary 
conditions are maintained at decent levels.  
 
The first thing we found when we started our 
systematic inspection programme was that the 
factories were sometimes unclean and in poor 
condition. Demands for a good clean up and a lick of 
paint - as well as better lighting and ventilation - 
made a real difference to the actual working 
environment. Better and cleaner toilets were required 
almost everywhere.  
 
Initially, fire safety often left something to be desired. 
Fire extinguishers and emergency exits were 
sometimes missing; if there were any emergency exits, they were often locked or blocked. Fire alarms 
were too repeatedly missing and evacuation plans and 
fire drills were rarely carried out. Now that we and 
other buyers have been setting requirements of better safety for a few years, there has been a real 
improvement in fire safety in the factories.  
 
To check wages, working hours, etc. we started by 
examining the documents that existed in the factories. 
Fairly soon we realised that first we had to get our 
suppliers to introduce meaningful reporting systems. 
For example, we made suggestions for how payroll 
reporting should be organised, with columns for the total number of hours worked, the number of 
overtime hours and for any bonuses or deductions, so 
that it was clear how the final pay was calculated. 
Only once the new reporting systems had been 
introduced were we able to effectively check that the 
staff were getting the wages to which they were 
entitled. 
 
We are proud of what we have accomplished so far. 
However, we have so far developed few indicators to 
verify our achievements. 
 
We also realise that the work towards a sustainable 
supply chain where human rights and workers rights 
are being respected is difficult and demanding.  Production  
 
H&M does not have any factories of its own. Instead, 
we buy our garments and other goods from 900 
suppliers, primarily in Europe and Asia. Our supply 
chain comprises mainly two types:  
 
Suppliers  are companies that have a direct business 
relationship to H&M. These companies may have factories of their own or they subcontract parts or 
their entire production. All variants exist, depending 
upon country. 
 
Sub-contractors  are companies that have been 
subcontracted by our suppliers. They do not have a 
direct business relationship with H&M. 
 
Production units  – this term is used to describe 
factories producing clothes for H&M, whether it is a 
supplier’s factory or subcontractor’s factory. 
 
In 2002, 2771 production units were registered. In 
these production units there is approximately a 
workforce of 540.000
5 people. 
 
                                    
5 This is an estimated number based on the figures given to us 
during our inspections. “H&M does not have 
any factories of its 
own.” 38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CSR Organisation 
 
H&M has around 30 Code of Conduct inspectors who 
carry out repeated inspections of supplier’s premises. 
The inspectors work at one of H&M’s 21 production 
offices, where around 110 quality controllers also 
have the task of reporting any infringements of the Code of Conduct that they find. The CSR-department 
is a corporate department with its manager reporting 
directly to the CEO.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Report to local office and buying office 
 
Inspection results are reported to the local H&M office 
as well as to the buying office in Stockholm. Results 
are registered in the Code of Conduct database.  CSR Reporting Structure

When setting our yearly targets, we make sure that 
they lead to the following long-term objectives. Each 
objective is expressing an ideal condition that serves 
to direct us to what we are aiming for.  
 
/Gd8/G20Full Code of Conduct Compliance by all 
suppliers and their subcontractors.  
 
/Gd8/G20Code of Conduct completely integrated 
with our business operations. The importance of Code of Conduct issues 
should be reflected in every day decisions as 
well as in strategic decisions.  
/Gd8/G20Factory workers empowered to claim their 
rights. 
The factory workers should be informed about 
labour laws and human rights according to 
national and international legislation. Their 
efforts in improving their working conditions 
should be supported. 
/Gd8/G20Code of Conduct compliance maintained 
through effective management systems. 
Tools and procedures should be developed in 
cooperation with the supplier.  
/Gd8/G20Knowledge among our stakeholders about 
our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts. 
The information or education given should be 
adapted to the various stakeholder groups.  
Inspector Workshops 
Twice yearly, H&M is organising workshops for the 
inspectors and other key people in the production 
offices. These workshops are further education for our 
inspectors with the purpose of exchanging best 
practices in different areas. Supply chain topics such 
as worker interviews, overtime, network building, 
piece-rate systems, migrant workers, work-
methodology, and statistics are addressed. In 2002, 
the workshops were held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia 
for our East and South-East Asian inspectors and in 
Istanbul, Turkey for our European inspectors.  
Networks  Due to the strong advisory function of our inspectors, 
a whole network of local contact has to be built up in 
each location. Examples are lawyers with knowledge 
of local legislation, schools, voluntary organisations, 
authorities, trade unions, UN-representatives, industry associations, and competitors.  
 
Inspections 
 
In 2002, the number of inspections was 2210. 
Approximately every third re-inspection was 
unannounced.  
  40Supplier assessment strategy  
 
To make sure that we reach our objectives and in order to gain trust from our stakeholders we need 
systems and procedures that are efficient and 
credible.  
 
Our strategy can in broad terms be described as 
follows:  
 
We at H&M wish to work together with our suppliers, 
on a long-term basis, to improve the conditions in the 
factories. We are sometimes asked why we do not 
immediately terminate our cooperation with suppliers 
who do not comply with our Code of Conduct. 
Obviously, that would be a simple solution for us, but 
H&M also feels a responsibility towards the people 
working in the factories. If H&M leaves a factory due to poor management, the ones that are truly affected 
are the workers. Another buyer indifferent to workers’ 
rights might then replace H&M.  
 
However, when we encounter serious violations a 
strong statement must be made. If the factory 
management is faking documents or if a supplier has 
subcontracted production to a production site that is 
not known to us6 or in other ways refuses to 
cooperate, we are forced to cease the cooperation.  
                                   
 
6 In case of an undeclared unit (a unit not known to us), we have no way 
of checking the working conditions and cannot be sure that our 
requirements are being met.  
There are numerous ways that management can 
mislead our inspectors consciously or unconsciously. 
Some examples are: 
/Gd8/G20If we only make announced inspections, 
child labour can be hidden away, fire-safety, 
cleanliness etc. can be temporary resolved. 
Therefore, we are sometimes making 
unannounced visits.   
/Gd8/G20Forged ID-cards can mislead factory 
management and us about a person’s age.  
/Gd8/G20Double record keeping (pay-slips, salary-
records, time-cards, log-books etc.). For 
example, through checking in detail that the 
information on the time-cards correspond with salary records and pay-slips, our inspectors 
often detect double record keeping. The records 
can also be validated through worker interviews. 
 
 
 
 
 
 “In our monitoring effort 
there is a strong element 
of consultation/education 
to really make our 
suppliers understand the 
importance and the 
advantages of complying 
with our code.”  41Compliance and Inspection 
procedures  
 
 
Prior to Inspection 
 
/Gd8/G20Compliance Commitment - Supplier has to 
sign the Code of Conduct commitment before 
the first inspection. This commitment includes 
all subcontractors who are also inspected. 
 
The Inspection  
/Gd8/G20Management interview  - The management is 
interviewed about relevant management 
practices, about salaries, working hours, 
freedom of association etc. according to a fixed 
list of questions. 
 
/Gd8/G20Factory inspection  - The factory is inspected 
to evaluate working environment, safety, child 
labour, etc in accordance with a questionnaire. 
 
/Gd8/G20Interviews with workers - Information 
sometimes needs to be validated through 
interviews to ensure that the suppliers are 
observing our requirements.  
 
 
 /Gd8/G20Inspection of residential area  - The 
residential facilities are inspected for cleanliness 
and safety according to a fixed list of items to 
check. 
 
/Gd8/G20Document Review  - Documentation to verify 
working hours, wages and overtime 
compensation is checked. Staff records and age 
certificates are checked. 
 
/Gd8/G20Closing meeting  - The inspection results are 
discussed with the supplier, as well as realistic 
time limits for improvements. 
 
/Gd8/G20Pre-inspection questionnaire  - If an 
inspection cannot be made immediately due to 
geographical distance, the supplier should fill in 
a pre-inspection self-assessment questionnaire. 
 
After the inspection 
 
/Gd8/G20Corrective action plan  - The supplier signs the 
corrective action plan. 
  42Non-compliance and Enforcement 
 
In case of repeated child labour, unsafe premises, 
faked documents, uncooperative management or 
repeated failure to make agreed corrections, H&M  
will terminate business permanently with the supplier.   
/Gd8/G20In 2002, we permanently terminated the 
business with 2 suppliers on these grounds. 
 
We also, due to other severe violations such as 
minimum wage not paid, unsafe premises, denied 
access to premises etc., grade the suppliers or their 
subcontractors as Unacceptable. If a supplier’s 
production unit is graded Unacceptable, our purchase 
order system obstructs the buyer from placing an 
order with that particular supplier. This obstruction 
will not be taken away until the supplier’s production 
unit has made the necessary improvements.  
 
• Production units previously inspected
7:  
 
At the end of the year 2002, 105 production 
units were graded, and remained Unacceptable  
for H&M production due to various code 
violations.  
 
 
                                    
7 These production units existed in 2001 or earlier. • Potential production units never inspected 
before8:  
 
In 2002 our inspectors graded another 
106 production units Unacceptable  for 
H&M production at their initial inspections9 
in spite of the fact that there were 
commercial reasons that spoke to the 
advantage of these units. The 106 
production units graded Unacceptable  for 
H&M production were graded 
Unacceptable  at both the first inspection 
and the follow up inspection. 
 
                                    
8 These production units have never before produced goods for H&M. 
9 Initial inspections  consists of a first inspection and, if graded 
unacceptable  for H&M production, a follow up inspection to check possible 
improvements.  43Violations 
 
Examples of common violations that our inspectors 
face when doing audits:  
 
/Gd8/G20Maintenance of safety issues. Many production 
units have, as a result of our work, 
implemented fire exits, fire alarms, fire 
extinguishers etc. However, the procedures to 
maintain the good safety level are lacking. 
/Gd8/G20Cleanliness and sanitary problems.  
/Gd8/G20Over time over the legal limit. Often due to 
inefficient ways of organizing work, the 
production units become dependent on workers 
putting in a lot of extra overtime. 
/Gd8/G20Overtime and leave compensation. Worker’s are 
too often not compensated enough, or at all, for 
worked over time or various leaves. 
 Child labour 
 
Child labour is a problem for the textile producing 
industry in developing countries. However, due to 
very clear communication, unannounced inspections, 
and severe sanctions from H&M, child labour is very 
rarely found.  
 
When a child is found H&M executes an action plan together with the child’s family and the supplier in 
order to get the child back in school. When seeking a 
solution for the child, H&M makes sure that the 
measures taken are in the child’s best interest. This is 
our primary focus.  
 
H&M demands the supplier to pay both for school and 
retained salary. H&M stays in contact with the 
supplier, the family and the school to make sure that 
the child continues his education. If this is not cared 
for, the children often are off to another job, trying to 
earn double incomes.

In order to improve conditions in the factories, 
education is of course fundamental. Many of the bad 
conditions in the factories are a result of inadequate 
management systems.   
H&M alone, or Business for Social Responsibility10, is 
organizing workshops on different issues such as local 
legislation, safety, labour rights, human rights. The 
target group is the managers of our suppliers and 
their subcontractors.  
 
/Gd8/G20In 2002, 12 workshops were organized for our 
suppliers and their subcontractors. 9 workshops 
were organized by H&M and 3 were organized 
by BSR. More than 700 managers from our 
suppliers and their subcontractors attended.  
 
                                   
 
10 Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) is a global non-profit organization that helps 
member companies achieve commercial success in ways that respect ethical values, people, 
communities and the environment. BSR member companies have nearly $2 trillion in 
combined annual revenues and employ more than six million workers around the world. Middle management education 
 
Besides other training events, H&M started a middle 
management training in Bangladesh, during the fall 
2002. The purpose of this training is to build the 
supplier management’s competence and capacity. 
 
Our goal is to help our suppliers’ middle management 
to see the benefits of complying with our code. This 
will only be sustained through their changed attitudes 
and behaviour. In 2003 this educational effort will be 
evaluated.  
Inspector tools  
/Gd8/G20Evaluation questionnaire  - The inspector has 
a questionnaire to support the inspection. The 
questionnaire contains approximately 100 
questions that correlate to our code of conduct. 
 
/Gd8/G20Evaluation questionnaire guidelines – To 
help the inspector there are guidelines on how 
to use the questionnaire and how to manage 
interviews in the most efficient way. 
 
/Gd8/G20Child labour guideline – To aid the inspector 
in a situation where child labour has been found 
there are guidelines to make sure that the 
child’s best interest is secured. 
 
/Gd8/G20Violation guideline – To guide the inspector 
when certain severe violations occur.  46 
/Gd8/G20Rating system guideline  – The guideline 
outlines what requirements need to be fulfilled 
to earn a certain grade. 
 
/Gd8/G20Worker interview guideline  – Supports the 
inspector on how to conduct interviews with 
garment workers. Enclosed with the guidelines 
is a questionnaire covering issues such as 
discrimination, working environment, fire safety, 
working hours, leaves, wages, child labour, 
forced labour, discrimination, punishment 
practices, freedom of association, forced labour.   
 Internal communication and education 
 
Between the fall of 2002 and summer 2003, the 
employees in our 844 shops, distributions centres and 
service offices will become educated about H&M’s CSR 
work. The purpose of this education is to build 
reliance and pride among our employees regarding 
our CSR-efforts. On top, our employees can now 
serve our customers with knowledgeable answers 
concerning this subject. 
 
Through our internal newsmagazine, the work around 
improving working conditions in our supply chain is constantly brought up.  
 
 
  
 47Targets 2003 
 
 
During 2003 we set out to accomplish quite a number 
of issues. Here are some examples: 
 
/Gd8/G20Advance the integration of the Code of Conduct 
responsibility in our everyday operations. 
Placing the responsibility of the monitoring 
effort and the code of conduct performance by 
our suppliers directly on the operational 
managers (i.e. the manager(s) of the Production 
Office). 
/Gd8/G20Improve inspector guidelines, that serve to 
educate and instruct our inspectors with a 
standardized tool aimed at guiding them in 
matters such as breeches of the code, worker 
interviews, inspections etc.  
/Gd8/G20Develop tools on how to do overtime audits. 
/Gd8/G20Develop inspections tools as well as decide a 
standard for dealing with chemicals in chemical intense production units. 
/Gd8/G20Developing and integrating Code of Conduct 
supporting functions in our new IT-system for 
Order Follow Up (OFS). Implementation will 
take place in 2004. 
/Gd8/G20Revise and implement the new rating system. 
/Gd8/G20Network building – Internally find and 
implement in all major markets best practice on 
how to build, maintain, and hand over a 
functioning network.   
 
 
 
  48Code of Conduct related projects 
 
The overtime project in China 
 
Below you find a general outline of this project. After 
phase four is completed, we will summarize the results that are expected to be included in our CSR-
report 2004. 
 
This project, as the name reveals, is trying to improve 
the situation regarding excessive and compulsory 
overtime. This is a problem in many countries, among 
them China. Impactt, a UK based organisation 
specialising in improving labour standards, has 
initiated the project, designed the methodology and is 
working in partnership with Chinese institutions. 
Impactt has convened a group of 5 purchasing 
companies - Debenhams, H&M, New Look, Pentland 
and Sainsbury - to work together to help supplier 
factories find ways of reducing excessive overtime 
working whilst maintaining appropriate wage levels. It is clear that asking factories to cut overtime, without 
addressing the causes of long working hours, will 
reduce workers wages and cause workers to leave the 
factory. The project aims to tackle some of the 
underlying factors which drive high levels of overtime 
by providing technical assistance on productivity, 
human resource management and improving 
management/labour relations in order to reduce the 
need for long overtime hours, without dramatically 
cutting wages.  
The objectives are to build: 
 
/Gd8/G20A model process for negotiating on overtime in 
factories 
/Gd8/G20A model process for allowing workers to 
exercise choice on whether they work overtime 
and how many hours they work 
/Gd8/G20An opportunity for factory managers to 
investigate ways of bringing hours of work and 
payment into line with the law without negative 
effects on their business. 
 
The project consists of four phases: 
 
/Gd8/G20Phase one: identifying factories and project 
partners (completed May 2001) 
/Gd8/G20Phase two: benchmarking the current situation 
in the factories (completed October 2001) 
/Gd8/G20Phase three: Driving improvements (completed 
December 2002): 
 
This will consist of: 
 
/Ga7/G20Training course for factory managers on 
effective human resource management 
/Ga7/G20Productivity consultancy in each factory carried 
out by the Hong Kong Productivity Council. This 
will consist of evaluation, recommendations, and 
implementation support. HKPC will also provide 
training for management and supervisors.  49/Ga7/G20Consultative PRA11 exercises with workers and 
management in each factory to begin to 
empower and involve workers changing their 
working conditions. These will be carried out by 
the Centre for Community Development 
Studies, Yunnan. 
/Ga7/G20Negotiations in each factory on reducing 
overtime, paying overtime premium and 
bringing in choice for workers on overtime 
working. The purchasing company will attend 
these. 
 
/Gd8/G20Phase four: Measuring change (April 2003) 
 
 
Freedom of Association in Export Processing 
Zones (EPZ) in Bangladesh 
 
 
Freedom of Association is not permitted in Bangladesh 
Export Processing Zone. Since 1999 we have been in 
contact with BEPZA (Bangladesh Export Processing 
Zone Association) in order to make them understand 
H&M’s view on this subject. We can now see actual 
transformation gradually take place. BEPZA instructs 
their members to implement Workers Welfare 
Committees (WWC) as a part of facilitating the 
implementation of labour unions that will be approved from January 2004. 
 
                                   
 
11 PRA – Participatory Rural Appraisal H&M is now requiring new potential suppliers in EPZ’s 
in Bangladesh to verify a number of issues concerning 
for example: 
 
/Gd8/G20Elections to WWCs 
/Gd8/G20WWC-meetings  
/Gd8/G20Education regarding the matters of a WWC 
/Gd8/G20Adherence to the law that will come in 2004 
 
Furthermore, a pilot project has been initiated 
together with a consultancy organisation. The project 
aims at capacity building of Workers’ Welfare 
Committees. Furthermore, apart from the obvious aim of implementing the WWC, an important purpose with 
the project is to find a methodology that is applicable 
in similar cases. 
 
  50Global Compact and the 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 
 
H&M supports the nine principles of the UN’s Global 
Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises. Supporting these internationally 
recognized charters means that H&M, as a company, 
explicitly adhere to the values these charters express.  
 Therefore, we wish to describe our positions and 
actions undertaken that provides support to the nine 
principles and the OECD Guidelines. These charters 
are multi-faceted. Hence, expectations on what we 
should report on will vary. We will be grateful to 
receive any comments regarding any apparent 
omissions in this regard. All the same, we also 
appreciate to be provided with positive feedback.  
 
However, the entire CSR-report is dealing with the 
provisions of these charters. The Principles of the UN’s 
Global Compact and the provisions of the OECD 
guidelines will either be treated one by one or in 
groups. The headlines from the 9 principles and the 
OECD Guidelines are used to make it possible for the reader to find the relevant passage from these 
charters. However, the full text from these charters 
will not be reproduced.   
Global Compact’s 9 principles 
 
Principle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6:  
 
 
/G71/G20To support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights within 
their sphere of influence.  
/G71/G20To make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses 
/G71/G20Uphold freedom of association and effectively recognize the right to collective bargaining; 
/G71/G20Promote the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; 
/G71/G20Promote the effective abolition of child labour; 
and 
/G71/G20Uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
 
/Gd8/G20As a policy, widely communicated, H&M’s Code 
of Conduct  serves as a non-negotiable 
standpoint. Here H&M makes clear that “We 
have to make sure that nobody whose work is 
contributing to our success, is deprived of his or 
her human rights, or suffers mental or bodily 
harm. The monitoring and sanction system  is 
there to ensure that our Code of Conduct is 
being implemented and is vital in improving the 
actual conditions in the supply chain.  
  51/Gd8/G20Child labour  is a challenge for the garment 
producing industry in developing countries. 
However, due to very clear communication, 
unannounced inspections, and severe sanctions 
from H&M, child labour is very rarely found. 
 
/Gd8/G20Compulsory and forced labour as we know it are 
not commonplace in the textile producing 
industry. The problem with certain sorts of 
compulsory or forced labour is that it is quite 
difficult to detect. Through monitoring 
crosschecks, demands on our suppliers etc we 
make it clear that human rights abuses are not acceptable.  
 
/Gd8/G20Freedom of Association in Export Processing 
Zones (EPZ) in Bangladesh is a right that 
currently is banned. H&M has initiated a pilot 
project together with a consultancy 
organisation. The project aims at capacity 
building of Workers’ Welfare Committees. An 
important purpose with the project is to find a 
methodology that is applicable in similar cases 
(e.g. China). Furthermore, H&M is now requiring 
new potential suppliers to present proof that 
shows that they are taking this matter seriously. 
Labour unions will be approved by BEPZA
12 from 
January 2004. 
 
                                    
12 BEPZA stands for Bangladesh Export Processing Zones 
Association   
/Gd8/G20To uphold the elimination of discrimination in 
respect of employment and occupation is a 
challenging task for anyone who really 
understands the notion of discrimination. To 
uphold the elimination of discrimination in a 
supply chain is even more difficult. Here 
educational efforts play a more important role 
than monitoring efforts due to the difficulties in 
detecting discriminatory behaviour.  
 
Nevertheless, we have made an effort in 
checking if the dismissal of pregnant women occurs. In addition, when different ethnic groups 
are present in one workplace, we try to make 
sure that no group is discriminated concerning 
wages paid. These two examples illustrate how 
we are dealing with discriminatory issues in our 
supply chain. 
 
/Gd8/G20In 2002, three BSR-workshops

/Gd8/G20Our environmental policy
 and our environmental 
objectives  are stressing the importance of 
applying a precautionary approach out of the 
respect for nature. We also consider it important 
to promote the awareness among employees 
and suppliers, and through various purchase 
requirements  impose environmentally friendly 
technologies to be used by our different 
suppliers. The subsequent examples illustrate 
the environmental work that constitutes our 
policy and objectives. 
 
 
 
-  Through our chemical restrictions , we are not 
only applying a precautionary approach by banning 
and restricting chemicals that may not necessarily be 
legally prohibited. We are also managing our supply-
chain; through the diffusion of know-how, making the 
suppliers take a greater environmental responsibility. 
 -  Our minimum environmental requirements for 
Road Transport Providers, IT-products, and shop-
interior are other ways of promoting and encouraging 
greater environmental responsibility and the 
development of environmentally sound technologies.

Combating Bribery 
 
/Gd8/G20H&M does not give or take any form of bribes. 
We dissociate ourselves from all types of 
corruption. This is valid for every individual employed by H&M, regardless of business area 
or position. 
 
Consumer interests 
 
/Gd8/G20The customers’/consumers’ interest is always in 
focus at H&M. Many of their interests are addressed in the chapter about Product 
Responsibility.  
 
Science and Technology 
 
/Gd8/G20Through various H&M requirements towards our 
suppliers and their subcontractors (Code of Conduct, Chemical restrictions etc) the diffusion 
of technologies and know-how is supported. H&M 
is obviously not a technology intensive company, 
which limits the relevance of this issue. 
 
Competition 
 
/Gd8/G20H&M performs business in a competitive manner 
and follow all applicable competitions laws. 
 
Taxation 
 
/Gd8/G20H&M complies with the tax laws and regulations 
in all countries where we operate. H&M always 
pay taxes timely. We provide the relevant 
authorities the information necessary for the 
correct determination of taxes in connection with 
our operations.  54Community Involvement 
 
 
Social development projects 
 
Vocational training in Bangladesh  
 
Children in Bangladesh are working for a multitude of 
reasons ranging from poverty and ignorance, to lack 
of access to educational opportunities. However, it may be noted that a vast majority of the children 
asserted that given the opportunity, they would 
attend school. Consequently, as a part of H&M's social 
responsibility program, we are financing development 
projects that are related to our Code of Conduct and 
the abolition of child labour. 
  
Vocational training for young textile workers in 
Bangladesh is one example. The program is intended 
to train ex-child labourers who previously lost their 
job due to under age. The children have been given 
basic education in the so-called MOU13-schools.  
 
H&M's training project includes a four-month 
theoretical and three-month practical program that leads to guaranteed employment as a machine 
operator at one of H&M's suppliers. H&M pay the

  55students' wages during the course as a means of 
support to their families. The project began in spring 
1999 and as of today, the 9th batch of students just 
completed their training. Currently around 50 
students trains in each class, divided on two locations 
in Dhaka. H&M has engaged highly qualified persons 
to set up the training centre. A consultant who has 
previously worked in similar projects for ILO and other 
UN agencies developed the training program. The 
head of the centre is also highly qualified from 
previous work with ILO and UCEP. 
 
This kind of project makes possible a long-term commitment that enables us to develop models for 
sustainable social development. The need for 
vocational training in Bangladesh is enormous. 
Garments being the country’s leading export, it is 
important for the future of the country to increase the 
level of skills in the garment industry. In line with our 
expectations and goals, the education level for the 
students, theoretically and practically, have improved. 
In addition, awareness has been raised for education 
among the students’ guardians. The students are not 
only trained to be first grade sewing operators, but 
are also taught to be positive thinkers and socially 
aware.  
  56Sponsored projects 
  
Rural development project in Delhi 
 
In rural parts of India, there are villages that remain 
completely outside of modern society. They have no electricity, sewerage, health care, medical treatment, 
government schools, etc. Women are often 
particularly vulnerable in such villages. For cultural 
and religious reasons, girls are not allowed to travel to 
the nearest town to go to school. The women of the 
village often supplement the family income with some 
kind of home working, which frequently means that 
older daughters have to take care of the children and 
housework rather than going to school if there is a 
school at all. 
 
A UNDP study supported by H&M was conducted by 
three local NGOs (contracted by UNDP) in 1999-2000 
in 20 villages. The study recommended a community 
development project for poverty alleviation in 6 out of these villages. The village project was initiated in 
January 2001. 
 
H&M is now financing this three-year project in 
northern India, which specifically hopes to improve 
conditions for women in selected villages around New 
Delhi. The project aims to strengthen the women’s 
situation and to prevent the use of child labour. The 
project organizes education in health matters, 
woman’s rights, and the consequences of child labour as well as investing in local teaching facilities and 
providing older children with computer training. 
Another challenge of this project is to create a model, 
that protects the rights of women and children, which 
can be applied to other villages under the same 
conditions. 
 
Child prevention project in Southern India 
 
For the third consecutive year H&M is donating 45 000 
Euro to Terre des hommes in Germany. The money 
will go to a local Indian organization in southern India 
that works on preventing child labour in Tiripur, where a lot of textiles are produced. 
 
The project aims at persuading parents to allow their 
children to go to school rather than working. Through 
organizing evening classes and weekend activities for 
the children, the Indian organization works to enable 
children to return to normal schooling as quickly as 
possible.  
 
H&M has chosen to support the Indian organization 
via Terre des hommes in Germany, which works to 
help vulnerable children around the world. It works 
not just on the problem of child labour, but also on 
other important child issues such as child soldiers and 
child prostitution. 
 
  57CSR-Initiatives - a few examples from our Sales 
Countries   
 
/Gd8/G20H&M Sweden supported the organisation Mentor 
with 1,5 million SEK in 2002.  
 
Mentor works to reduce drug abuse among young 
people. Their preventative work is focused on 
building strong individuals. Together with 
companies, schools and parents, Mentor is running 
two major drug preventive programs. Hundreds of 
various experts comprise the Mentor network. 
 
/Gd8/G20H&M Switzerland cooperated with Switzerland’s 
Federal office for public health (StopAids) 
 
All H&M shops in Switzerland were used as a 
communication platform during two very busy 
Saturdays in December. The sales staff was wearing a 
special “StopAids” t-shirt. Customers (except children) 
received a condom and a card to enable participation 
in a web-based contest. Before this event, The Federal 
office for public health sent out a press release to all 
medias.  
 
The broad target of this event was to lead people to 
the StopAids website. The response was impressive. 
10.000 people participated in the web-based contest. In addition, the reaction from media and our business 
partners were positive. Equally important, our staff 
was motivated to be part of this cause.   
/Gd8/G20H&M Norway and H&M Denmark has together 
supported the Breast cancer awareness 
campaign with approximately 500.000 SEK in 
2002. 
 
/Gd8/G20H&M England has supported Fashion Targets 
Breast Cancer with approximately £8.000. 
 
H&M donates clothes to charity  
 
Every year major tragedies occur around the world. 
Naturally, this contributes to a great need of clothing for victims of war and natural catastrophes. H&M 
continues to donate clothes to those in need. 
 
H&M's fierce efforts at improving quality have resulted 
in a number of orders being held back from sale in 
recent years. Clothes that do not meet H&M's quality 
standards are not passed on to the stores. 
 
We have signed an agreement with a reputable aid 
organization in each sales country and large quantities 
of new clothes have been sent to those in need 
through these organizations in recent years. 
 
It is understood that we never give away clothes that 
contain dangerous chemicals or that are otherwise classed as hazardous waste. Such garments are 
destroyed.  58Cause Related Marketing 
 
The WaterAid Project 
 
Safe water is something many of us take for granted. 
However, in many parts of Asia and Africa, women and children may have to travel for hours to reach the 
nearest source of clean water. The British charity 
WaterAid, with its partners in fifteen countries, help to 
prevent death and the spread of disease by providing 
safe domestic water supplies and better sanitation in 
poor areas. 
 
In 2002 H&M donated 10% of the selling price of a 
bikini to WaterAid. The total donation was more than 
GBP 30,000. WaterAid is running one of their projects 
in the slums of Dhaka where short supply of clean 
water has caused severe diseases and high infant 
mortality. Bangladesh is one of H&M’s main 
production countries in Asia, and we have chosen to 
donate the money to WaterAid’s project in Dhaka, in order to support the community in an area where our 
garments are produced.  
 
  59Product Responsibility 
 
Customer Health and Safety 
 
Quality controls  
H&M sets high quality requirements. At the buying 
office in Stockholm there are about 20 people 
supporting the production offices in quality related 
issues. They are textile engineers, chemists, 
designers, and all experienced. To ensure the quality 
of all products at the production stage, we have 110 
quality controllers employed in the production offices 
that regularly go to the factories to control and correct 
any quality problems in the course of production. We 
also, most often, carry out a final inspection before 
the goods are shipped. H&M uses the AQL
14-system 
2.5 to decide whether the quality level is acceptable 
for shipment. 
 H&M demands of all suppliers to have a built-in 
quality control system in each factory. This system, 
called GPQ (Guidelines for Production and Quality 
Control), is coordinated with the system the 110 H&M 
Quality Controllers use when checking the production. 
The main purpose is to detect any quality problems as 
early as possible in the production and to correct 
                                   
 
14 AQL=  Acceptable Quality Level  them. The goods are controlled at several stages 
during production including packing stage. 
 
 
 
 
 
  60Quality testing 
 
Samples of every product in H&M’s collections 
undergo a number of quality and safety tests. 
Garments are washed and measured to check that 
they do not shrink or twist and to check their 
colourfastness and dry rubbing. In addition, we test 
salt and chlorine bleaching, pilling and seam strength. 
Durability tests are carried out on details such as 
zippers and press-button. Flammability tests are 
performed to check that the garment is not easily 
flammable. Final quality control takes place at our 
distribution centres before the garments are distributed to the stores. During 2002 approximately 
500 000 tests were performed, mainly at our 17 
Production Office labs, but also at some external 
laboratories.  
 
Children’s safety 
 
Children's clothes must meet particularly high safety 
requirements. It is our constant goal to have baby’s- 
and children’s wear designed and made with safety in 
mind. All suppliers of baby and children garments 
must sign H&M’s Safety Requirements for Baby’s- and 
Children’s wear. There are no international standards 
for Children Safety. Some countries have national 
standards, whereas we at H&M always follow the one of our selling countries that has the strictest safety 
regulations.  
 At every production office there is a person 
responsible for children’s safety. A majority of 
designers, buyers, and staff at our production offices 
have been educated in issues concerning children’s 
safety. New employees are also getting this training. 
Every supplier of children’s and baby garments must 
receive a special children’s safety training in order to 
qualify as a supplier for children’s garments.  
 
Furthermore, on the request of SIS (Swedish 
Standards Institute) and BSI (The British Standards 
Institution) H&M participates in the work to establish 
safety standards for baby and children’s garments. This work is organized by CEN – The European 
Committee for Standardization.  
 
Some examples of H&M’s children safety requirements 
that illustrate our dedication: 
 
/Gd8/G20H&M pays extra attention to hoods and 
drawstrings in order to avoid situations where 
the construction of the garment increases the 
risk for entrapment or suffocation. Buttons and 
snap buttons must be securely fastened. 
/Gd8/G20The supplier must make sure that no details on 
the garments have sharp edges or sharp points 
/Gd8/G20All sewn on buttons, press buttons, ribbons, etc. 
are tested according to the standard for small parts and must also be securely fastened to 
withstand normal wear and wash.  61/Gd8/G20H&M is trying to avoid too many details and 
decorations on Baby and Children garments to 
prevent them from being a safety risk. 
/Gd8/G20Before packed and exported all Baby and 
Children garments are going through a needle 
detector machine, which detects any small 
fragment of metal such as broken needles. 
 
 
We should underline that H&M reserves the right to 
cancel the order or, if already delivered, return the 
goods if any of the conditions in H&M’s safety 
requirements for children’s and baby wear will fail in a test according to mentioned standard for small parts. 
 
H&M also holds the supplier responsible for any 
consequences caused by products that do not meet 
our requirements. 
 Care Label instructions 
 
As in all our work with quality, also our work on 
labelling is strongly customer orientated. Since 
autumn 2002, in correspondence with American 
regulation, all garments are labelled with country of 
origin information. However, no matter where the 
garments are produced, our quality requirements are 
the same. Furthermore, our long-term goal is that 
wearing and caring of our garments should be simple 
and comfortable in the everyday life of all our 
customers.  
 On children’s wear, our goal is that all garments 
should be washable in 60 degrees as well as suitable 
for tumble-drying. Today the majority of them are 
washable in 60 degrees. In addition, the vast majority 
of H&M clothing can be machine-washed and does not 
have to be dry-cleaned. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  62Chemical restrictions  
 
H&M has, with the concern for the health of our 
customers as well as for the environment and the 
working conditions in the factories where our products 
are made, established Chemical Restrictions for 
textile, leather, plastic and metal products. 
 
H&M's suppliers contractually guarantee not to use 
certain chemicals in production. These chemicals are, 
or could be hazardous to health and environment. 
Particular consideration is given to substances that 
could cause skin irritation or allergies or that may be carcinogenic. The precautionary principle is guiding 
our work when restricting chemicals. The restrictions 
therefore include both chemicals restricted by law, 
and chemicals we have chosen to include for 
precautionary reasons. As an important part of H&M’s 
long-term work against allergies, we are participating 
in work aimed at establishing reliable standards for 
testing allergenic substances.  
 
We require compliance with these restrictions from all 
our suppliers, and all suppliers must sign the Chemical 
Restrictions Compliance Commitment and/or 
Restrictions for Cosmetic and Hygiene Products. In 
this way we also contribute to reducing the 
environmental impact of the production stage, as well as in the incineration and recycling of worn-out 
clothing. 
 Tests are performed to check that the banned 
chemicals are not present in the garments. PH, PVC, 
AZO and Formaldehyde are some of the most 
common. 
 
The phase out of PVC 
 
In the mid-1990s H&M decided to 
gradually remove all PVC products from the range for environmental and health 
reasons. PVC - short for polyvinyl 
chloride - is a plastic that is used in items such as rainwear, imitation leather, bags and cosmetics bags as well 
as in prints on T-shirts. It is also often 
found in various types of packaging. From 1 January 2002 H&M does no 
longer sell products containing PVC.  63The tests are carried out partly in H&M´s own 
laboratories and partly by external laboratories. 
Considering the number of styles and garments H&M 
is selling, naturally the number of tests is large. We 
have estimated that approximately 30,000 chemical 
related tests were performed during 2002. In 
addition, the nickel release is checked in jewellery and 
metal details in contact with the skin. Samples from 
every order are tested. 
 
Our chemical restrictions are continuously updated, 
with new substances being added on a regular basis. 
In 2001 H&M entered into cooperation, through BSR, with a number of companies, to establish common 
restrictions. These restrictions are now finalized and 
can be viewed as an industry standard and a 
minimum level. The list is predominantly based on 
worldwide legislation
15 and regulations, while also 
maintaining a perspective on legislative trends and 
stakeholder concerns which is indicated by the fact 
that H&M has gone further than the agreed 
restrictions stipulates.  
 
The chemicals currently included in our chemical 
restrictions are listed below . The list was latest 
updated in May 2002. The restrictions are applied to 
the various products in our product range according to 
relevance and risk. The limits and test methods are 
                                    
15 If law in one of our sales countries restricts a chemical, we 
always follow the same restriction for all our sales countries. 
 also defined as per tested material, legislation, 
technical feasibility etc.  
 
Co-operations 
 
A proactive work in the areas of quality, health and 
safety is essential and given a high priority within 
H&M. Nevertheless, in order to stay ahead in this 
area, a close co-operation and exchange with relevant 
authorities is crucial. Our co-operation and knowledge 
exchange with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC), the National Chemicals 
Inspectorate in Sweden, and other similar organisations help us to become a leader in the field. 
 
  64Products and Services 
 
Animal rights  
 
H&M acknowledges fair treatment of animals. When 
documented unfair treatment of animals has been 
brought to our attention, we have made decisions that 
minimize the risk for H&M to be complicit to the 
mistreatment. H&M does only accept leather and fur 
from animals that are used for meat-production. H&M 
does not accept any leather production in India due to 
the alleged bad conditions in which the animals are 
transported.  
 
Animal testing   
H&M does not allow animal testing on cosmetic and 
hygiene products, either during production or of the 
finished products. All the ingredients used in H&M’s 
products are approved in accordance with the high 
requirements set by the authorities and by H&M itself. 
Products are always assessed for their safety and 
quality. H&M has had a policy on animal testing since 
mid 1990’s. This policy forms part of H&M’s 
restrictions for cosmetic and hygiene products
16. All 
                                    
16 H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB and H & M Rowells AB Restrictions 
for Cosmetic and Hygiene Products. suppliers of H&M’s own cosmetic and hygiene 
products have to abide by these restrictions. The 
supplier also has a duty to inform his subcontractors 
of H&M’s restrictions and ensure that they abide by 
them.  
 
Advertising policy 
 
Every year, we communicate H&M’s business concept, 
“fashion and quality at the best price” through 
different advertising campaigns throughout Europe 
and parts of the U.S.A. Our advertising is clear and 
simple and aims to inform our customers about H&M’s 
new products while representing who we are and what 
we stand for. We present the latest fashion and the 
price of the garment. 
 Our advertisements are produced centrally in Sweden 
by H&M’s advertising department in cooperation with 
internal and independent creators. Our advertising is 
in large part identical in all of H&M’s markets, but the 
medium used varies according to local needs and 
necessities. We have opted to follow the International 
Chamber of Commerce’s basic rules for 
advertisement. 
 
                                                                               
 
  65Our marketing is very influential. It is therefore 
essential for us to convey a positive, healthy image. 
H&M’s advertising photos do not aim to convey a 
specific ideal. We portray different characterizations 
and a mix of different looks and styles for our variety 
of concepts for women, kids, men, and teenagers.  
 
The models portrayed in our advertisements should 
be healthy and wholesome. H&M deliberately distances itself from drug and alcohol abuse. Our 
models are chosen in cooperation with internationally 
recognized modelling agencies and our own 
representatives. The agencies we rely on must 
guarantee that none of their models suffer from 
eating disorders or drug or alcohol abuse. The reason 
why we use professional models is that they are 
accustomed to working in front of a camera and are 
therefore able to do justice to our garments. By 
working with professional models, photographers and 
stylists, we communicate our fashion and quality in a 
clear and inspiring manner. We have special 
guidelines when it comes to advertising our “kids” 
concept. Our target group is parents, not children. 
This means that we place our advertisements in media that are not directly focused on children. We 
are careful to make sure that the children appearing 
in our advertisements choose freely to participate. A 
representative from H&M is always present during child photo sessions to ensure the seriousness of the 
session and the children’s safety. We market clothing 
for both boys and girls in different age groups. We 
reflect diversity in society by using children from 
different cultural backgrounds. 
 
H&M follows the International Chamber of 
Commerce’s basic rules on advertising.

  74Enclosure #1: Code of Conduct  
 
 
I N T R O D U C T I O N                    
 
H&M, as a strongly expanding multinational company, feels that it is increasingly important for us to take responsibility for a ll our actions, 
in Europe as well as in the rest of the world. Most importantly we have a responsibility towards all the thousands of people ta king part in 
the production of our garments. We have to make sure that nobody whose work is contributing to our success is deprived of his o r her 
human rights, or suffers mental or bodily harm.  
 
In order to make our position clear to our suppliers, our own staff, as well as any other parties, we have set up a Code of Con duct. It is a 
non-negotiable requirement from our side that all our suppliers and their subcontractors, without exception, should follow this  code.   
 
1. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS  
Our general rule is that all our suppliers must, in all their activities, follow the national laws in the countries where they are operating. 
Should any of the following requirements by H&M, be in violation of the national law in any country or territory, the law shoul d always be 
followed. In such a case, the supplier must always inform H&M immediately upon receiving this Code. 
 It is however important to understand that H&M's requirements may not be limited to the requirements of the national law.  
 
2. CHILD LABOUR 
 2. 1 Policy 
 
We base our policy on child labour on the UN Convention on The Rights of the Child, article 32.1. 
 We recognise the rights of every child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely t o be 
hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, mo ral or social 
development. 
 
  75 
2.2 Definition 
 
We define, in this context, the word "child" as a person younger than 15 years of age or, as an exception, 14 years in countrie s covered 
by article 2.4 in the ILO convention No.138.  
 
2.3  Implementation of H&M's policy on Child labour   
 
H&M does not accept child labour. 
 
We are concerned about the situation of children in many parts of the world. We acknowledge the fact that child labour does exi st and 
cannot be eradicated with rules or inspections, as long as the children’s social situation is not improved. We want to actively  work with 
factories and with NGO's (Non Government Organisations) in third world countries, to try to improve the situation for the child ren 
affected by our ban on child labour. 
 If a child (see definition under 2.2) is found working in any of the factories producing our garments, we will request the fact ory to make 
sure that the measures taken are in the child's best interest. We will, in co-operation with the factory, seek to find a satisf actory solution, 
taking into consideration the child's age, social situation, education, etc. We will not ask a factory to dismiss a child witho ut a discussion 
about the child's future. Any measures taken should always aim to improve, not worsen, each individual child's situation. Any c osts for 
education, etc. have to be paid by the factory. 
 
We will firmly demand that the factory employs no further children.  
We recommend factories with predominantly female workers to arrange day care for children below school age.  
 
2.4 Enforcement 
 
If a supplier does not accept our policy on child labour, we will not continue our co-operation with this supplier.   
 
2.5 Apprenticeship programmes 
 
In countries where the law permits apprenticeship programmes for children between 12 and 15 years of age, we will accept that c hildren 
of this age work a few hours per day. The total numbers of hours daily spent on school and light work should never exceed 7 (se ven) 
hours (ILO convention No. 33). The factory must be able to prove that this work is not interfering with the child's education, that the 
work is limited to a few hours per day, that the work is light and clearly aimed at training, and that the child is properly co mpensated. If   76we have any reason to doubt that these conditions are met, such apprenticeship programmes will not be accepted in factories pro ducing 
garments for H&M. 
 
2.6 Special recommendations 
 
We acknowledge, that according to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, a person is a child until the age of 18. We the refore 
recommend our suppliers to make sure, that employees in the age group 15-18 years are treated accordingly. Limits for working h ours 
and overtime for this age group should be set with special consideration to the workers' low age.   
 
3. SAFETY 
 
3.1 Building and Fire Safety 
 
We require from our suppliers that the workers' safety should be a priority at all times. No hazardous equipment or unsafe buil dings are 
accepted.  
 
 The factory should have clearly marked exits, and preferably emergency exits on all floors. All exit doors should open outwards . Exits 
should not be blocked by cartons, fabric rolls or debris, and should be well lit. If emergency exits are locked, the keys shoul d be placed 
behind breakable glass next to the doors, and thus be available to all staff at all times.  
 All workers should be aware of the safety arrangements in the factory, such as emergency exits, fire extinguishers, first aid e quipment, 
etc. An evacuation plan should be displayed in the factory, the fire alarm should be tested regularly, and regular evacuation d rills are 
desirable. 
 
3.2 First Aid 
 
First aid equipment must be available in each factory, and at least one person in each department should have training in basic  first aid. 
 It is recommended that a doctor or nurse should be available at short notice, in case of an accident in the factory. The employ er should 
pay any costs (not covered by the social security) which a worker may incur for medical care, following an injury during work i n the 
factory.  
  774. WORKERS' RIGHTS 
 
4.1 Basic Rights 
 
All workers producing garments for H&M should be entitled to his or her basic rights:  
 
4.1.1 We do not accept that bonded workers, prisoners or illegal workers are used in the production of goods for H&M.   
4.1.2 If foreign workers are employed on contract basis, they should never be required to remain employed for any period of tim e against 
their own will. All commissions and other fees to the recruitment agency in connection with their employment should be covered by the 
employer.   
4.1.3 Under no circumstances do we accept that our suppliers or their subcontractors use corporal punishment or other forms of mental 
or physical disciplinary actions, or engage in sexual harassment.  
4.1.4 All workers should be free to join associations of their own choosing, and they should have the right to bargain collecti vely. We do 
not accept any disciplinary actions from the factory against workers who choose to peacefully and lawfully organise or join an association. 
 4.1.5 No worker should be discriminated against because of race, gender, religion or ethnic background. All workers with the sa me 
experience and qualifications should receive equal pay for equal work. 
 4.1.6 All workers should be entitled to an employment contract. 
  784.2 Wages and Working Hours 
 
4.2.1 Wages should be paid regularly, on time and be fair in respect of work performance. The legal minimum wages should be a 
minimum, but not a recommended, level.   4.2.2 Weekly working time must not exceed the legal limit, and overtime work should always be voluntary and properly compensate d.  
 
4.2.3 The workers should be granted their stipulated annual leave and sick leave without any form of repercussions.  
 
4.2.4 Female workers should be given their stipulated maternity leave in case of pregnancy.   4.2.5 Dismissal of pregnant female workers is not acceptable.  
 
In developing countries, we recommend our suppliers to provide the workers with at least one free meal daily. 
 
5. FACTORY CONDITIONS 
 
5.1 It is important for the workers' well-being, and for the quality of the garments, that the factory environment is clean and  free from 
pollution of different kinds.   
5.2 The temperature in the factory should be tolerable as a working environment, and the ventilation should be adequate. Heater s or fans 
should be provided when needed.  
5.3 The lighting in each workplace should be sufficient for the work performed, at all times of day. 
 5.4 Sanitary facilities should be clean, and the workers should have access without unreasonable restrictions. The number of  f acilities 
should be adequate for the number of workers in the factory. Sanitary facilities should be available on each floor, and prefera bly 
separated for men and women. 
  796. HOUSING CONDITIONS 
 
If a factory provides housing facilities for its staff, the requirements regarding safety and factory conditions, under point 3  and 5 above, 
should also cover the housing area. 
 All workers must be provided with their own individual bed, and the living space per worker must meet the minimum legal require ment. 
 
Separate dormitories, toilets and showers should be provided for men and women. There should be no restriction on the workers' right to leave the dormitory during off hours.   
We want to particularly stress the importance of fire alarms, fire extinguishers, unobstructed emergency exits and evacuation d rills in 
dormitory areas. 
 
7. ENVIRONMENT 
 
The environment is of increasing concern globally and H&M expects its suppliers to act responsibly in this respect.   
 
Our suppliers must comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations in the country of operation.  
 
According to the H&M Chemical Restrictions, we do not allow use of solvents or other hazardous chemicals in the production of o ur 
garments. All suppliers must sign the H&M Chemical Restriction Commitment, confirming that no prohibited chemical substances wi ll be 
used in the production. 
 
8. MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT 
 
8.1 The principle of trust and co-operation 
 
H&M expects all its suppliers to respect the above Code of Conduct and to actively do their utmost to achieve our standards. We  trust our 
own staff to take a lot of responsibility in their work, and we expect from our suppliers that they do the same. We believe in co-operation 
and we are willing to work with our suppliers to achieve workable solutions in each individual case.  
 We are willing to take into consideration cultural differences and other factors which may vary from country to country, but we  will not 
compromise on our basic requirements regarding safety and human rights. 
  808.2 Monitoring  
 
All suppliers are obliged to always keep H&M informed about where each order is being produced. H&M reserves the right to make 
unannounced visits to all factories producing our goods, at any time.  We also reserve the right to let an independent third pa rty (e.g. a 
NGO) of our choice make inspections, to ensure compliance with our Code of Conduct. 
 
8.3 Non-compliance  
Should we find that a supplier does not comply with our Code of Conduct, we will terminate our business relationship with this supplier, if 
corrective measures are not taken within an agreed time limit.  
 
If we find repeated violations, we will immediately terminate the co-operation with the supplier and cancel our existing orders .
