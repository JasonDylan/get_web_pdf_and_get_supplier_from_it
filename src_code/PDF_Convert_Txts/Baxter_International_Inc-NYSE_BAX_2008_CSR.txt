This Baxter 2008 Sustainability Priorities Report describes progress 
against each of Baxter's nine sustainability priorities. See the  
comprehensive report online for performance information on the  
full range of Baxter's sustainability activities as well as additional  
detail about several of the priorities described in this document.
Verifica Tion aSSurance
Baxter commissioned erM certification and Verification Services  
(erM cVS) to perform verification assurance on the following 
environment, health and safety ( eHS)-related sections of this  
Baxter 2008 Sustainability Priorities Report, as noted by the symbol:∙ Safe and Healthy Workplace∙ carbon footprint∙ natural resource use∙ Product Stewardship
This review is designed to confirm that information presented is an 
accurate, reliable and transparent representation of performance. erM cVS also has provided assurance on all eHS content in the 
comprehensive sustainability report online. See more information  in the Sustainability Reporting section online.From the Chairman and CEO
Baxter plays a unique role in healthcare. Virtually every product we make is used 
to treat a critical, life-threatening condition. Our therapies are infused, injected or inhaled an estimated six million times a day, in more than 100 countries, to save and sustain the lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders, end-stage kidney disease and other critical illnesses.
The sustainability challenges we face as a society are no less critical. Poverty, 
hunger, climate change, resource depletion, and lack of access to quality healthcare and education are just some of the threats to the well-being of future generations. 
At Baxter, we are committed to applying the same dedication and spirit of innovation to improving the health of the planet as we do in developing new and better therapies for patients.
We define sustainability as a long-term approach to including our social, economic and environmental responsibilities 
among our business priorities. Baxter’s efforts in this area align with and support our mission of saving and sustaining lives.
This is the 10th year that Baxter has published a sustainability report. In all of our sustainability-related activities, 
whether it’s corporate giving, expanding access to healthcare, strengthening education or other areas you can read about in this report, we strive to be leaders, setting the pace for others to follow.
esta Blishing s ustaina Bility as p art of our c ulture 
Since joining Baxter as chairman and chief executive officer in 2004, I have been highly supportive of accelerating Baxter’s sustainability efforts, and I am proud of the progress we’ve made in making sustainability part of our culture.
Our formation in 2006 of an executive-level Sustainability Steering Committee to guide our global sustainability 
efforts was a significant step forward. It further institutionalized sustainability at Baxter and elevated accountability for sustainability across the company and to the highest levels of management.
The creation of nine sustainability priorities in 2007 was the next step in this process. These priorities, which are the 
focus of our print report this year, define what we consider to be the most important sustainability areas as a company and help us channel our resources where we can maximize our impact. Since then, we have added long-term 2015 goals for each priority to further clarify our expected progress. Advancement toward these targets is measured quarterly and reported to management.
Our sustainability priorities tie to larger societal goals. For Baxter, increasing access to healthcare, promoting diversity 
and inclusion, strengthening education and reducing our environmental impact are all areas where Baxter’s success contributes to a greater good while also benefiting us as a company. Acting with integrity, ensuring the health and safety of our employees, and developing partnerships with suppliers to foster a “greener” supply chain are equally important to industry leadership.
In early 2009, we added to our product stewardship priority an animal welfare goal to identify additional opportunities 
to replace, reduce and refine (“ 3Rs”) the use of animal 
testing. While we have long-standing policies and practices 
designed to minimize animal testing, the addition of this goal reflects our continuing commitment to build on our history of conscientious action and innovation in this area. 
looking a head, m oving f orward
Despite these accomplishments, sustainability is not about yesterday’s achievements. It is about creating a better world for tomorrow. We must continue to engage our customers, suppliers, employees, communities, other business sectors, and regional and national governments if we are truly to make the progress necessary to meet  the challenges we face.
We are in the midst of one of the most difficult economic 
crises in our lifetimes. While no company, including Baxter, is immune to the issues affecting the global economy, we remain committed to making a positive impact on the health and well-being of our local and global communities.
As a society, the biggest problem we face in tackling our  
most pressing sustainability challenges is simply the scope 
and enormity of the task. Successfully addressing these challenges requires the cooperative effort of governments, businesses, interest groups and individual citizens.
I believe corporations can play a lead role in making  
a difference. I encourage all stakeholders to join us  
in appreciating today’s sustainability challenges and  
contributing toward long-term solutions. Working together, we can create a better world for future generations.

Priorities and Goals
Although committed to addressing a broad range 
of sustainability issues, Baxter recognizes the 
importance of having clear priorities to focus its 
efforts and direct its initiatives. 
In 2007, the company's executive-level Sustainability Steering 
Committee defined nine priorities that fall into three broad  
categories: Our People, Our Operations and Products, and  
Our World. These priorities reflect issues of key concern to Baxter  
and its stakeholders and areas where the company is uniquely positioned to have a positive impact. Since then, Baxter has established longer-term performance goals for each priority to demonstrate the company’s commitment, motivate continual  
improvement and help stakeholders assess performance. This table outlines Baxter’s sustainability priorities and goals, and 
notes related information in this report and in the full report online.

As a company focused on creating life-saving products and therapies, Baxter considers it a natural extension of its 
work to make a positive impact on the safety and health of its employees and contractors.
£employee s afety In 2008, Baxter identified the following facility-level processes as the most effective ways 
to improve safety performance and strengthen the safety culture companywide:
      Hazard identification and risk assessment:   A 2008  
survey of facilities revealed that hazard identification and risk assessment programs reflect varying degrees of maturity. Baxter is standardizing its efforts in 2009  
to improve consistency.
  
Near-miss reporting:   A near-miss program identifies  
incidents that might have resulted in injury, illness or damage 
but did not. For 2009, Baxter established eight required 
elements of an effective near-miss program and is tracking 
facility progress in implementing these across the company.
In 2007, Baxter’s cases with days lost rate performance ranked fourth of industry peers.²
£health and w ellness A productive and healthy workforce is vital to Baxter’s ongoing success. Through  
BeWell@Baxter, the company’s global employee health and wellness effort introduced in 2007, Baxter is building a  
culture that promotes work-related and personal health. BeWell@Baxter aligns the company’s many health and 
wellness initiatives under a comprehensive program that raises awareness and supports individual accountability 
and engagement. 
In 2008, Baxter launched its vision for global smoke-free campuses. By the end of the year, 77 percent of company 
facilities were smoke-free campuses. The target for the end of 2009 is 80 percent of global facilities.
Baxter also launched its Personal Wellness Profile in 2008, an online health risk assessment that helps employees better understand how their lifestyle choices, family history and other factors impact their health. Employees set health goals, create action plans and track their progress. The company’s target is for 25 percent of employees globally to 
complete the assessment in 2009. Using the aggregate results, Baxter will target programs to address risk and need. 
In addition, in 2008 Baxter’s seasonal influenza prevention program vaccinated 37 percent of employees worldwide,
 
compared to 29 percent the previous year.¹  All rates based on 100 full-time employees working one year, which equals 
a total of 200,000 work hours. For tracking purposes, Baxter applies U.S. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordkeeping practices 
worldwide. Cases with days lost: work-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to lose at least one full day of work after the date of the incident. Days lost: number of days lost due to work-related injuries and illnesses. 
Recordable cases: work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention 
beyond first-aid, including cases with days lost. Serious incidents and Fatalities: see Baxter Summary Data Table 2004-2008 on page 22.

Baxter believes that an inclusive culture and a diverse workforce can drive innovation; create trusted partnerships 
with customers, suppliers and community partners; and contribute to business success. 
Beyond building a globally diverse organization of individuals from various backgrounds, perspectives and  
experiences, Baxter is committed to fostering an inclusive culture where differences are valued and respected. 
The company partners with organizations that embrace inclusion, including those involved in Baxter’s philanthropic and volunteerism efforts. Working with diverse suppliers is also integral to the company’s inclusion strategy. 
£glo Bal inclusion council In 2008, Baxter established a Global Inclusion Council, composed of leaders 
from across the company. The Council provides thought leadership, guidance and support to implement Baxter’s 
global inclusion strategy. In 2008, the Council created internal awareness of the inclusion strategy, enhanced cross-
cultural awareness of Council leaders, and assessed best practices. The Council also identified new opportunities to further the strategy in 2009 and beyond. 
£employee feed Back In 2008, Baxter conducted 17 
employee roundtables involving 200 randomly selected employees 
from 28 countries. Members of executive management facilitated 
these sessions, designed to improve understanding of local and 
organization-wide diversity and inclusion challenges, opportunities 
and perspectives. In 2009, Baxter will use feedback from the  
roundtables coupled with employee perspectives from the company’s  
2009 Culture Survey to help shape future inclusion efforts that will focus on training and education. 
£supplier diversity Baxter strives to develop mutually 
beneficial relationships with small and diverse suppliers, given  
the importance these suppliers have to the company and to the 
communities where Baxter employees live and work. In 2008, the company spent approximately $457 million with small businesses  in the United States and Puerto Rico, 17 percent of Baxter’s supplier 
spending in those markets. The company spent $88 million with 
women-owned businesses and $24 million with minority-owned  firms in those locations.

Award
Winner99priority : Baxter Will Promote Ethical Conduct and Legal Compliance
Corruption poses a significant challenge to the global economy. It is an impediment to sustainable development,
increases inequality, undermines public institutions and dampens economic growth. For companies, corruptionadds to the cost of doing business, represents significant legal and reputational risks and creates unsustainablebusiness relationships.  
Corruption risks differ by industry. In the healthcare industry, maintaining ethical interactions with healthcare providers 
is essential to ensure that purchasing decisions are based on efficacy and quality and not on inappropriate factors. Companies, including Baxter, have a pivotal role to play in promoting sound ethics by maintaining high standards and 
demanding that their business partners do the same. Baxter is committed to operating with the highest integrity and 
ethical and legal standards.
In 2008, Baxter launched its new Code 
of Conduct. Available in 20 languages, it 
builds upon the prior code by identifying expected behaviors and explaining why compliance to each standard is important
 
to Baxter’s business. In 2009, the company  
will train all of its employees globally on the Code of Conduct.
Baxter updated its Global Anticorruption 
Policy in 2008, which governs how the company’s employees, contractors, agents and third parties interact with 
government officials. The company also revised its U.S. and international policies for interactions with healthcare 
practitioners, medical institutions and patient organizations. Baxter conducts risk assessments covering all of its  operations, and it audits and monitors performance in this area through its compliance assessments and other means.
In early 2009, Baxter launched a risk-based anticorruption education program that provides ongoing training and communication to various groups within the company to sustain awareness.

is among the topics covered in Baxter’s new Code of Conduct.BAXTER 2008  SUSTAINABILITY PRIORITIES REPORT
Anticorruption efforts can be impeded or enhanced by  
others in the industry, so Baxter is committed to establishing or improving industry codes of conduct and promoting ethical behavior across the healthcare sector. For example, 
Baxter is highly involved in AdvaMed and Eucomed, which 
are U.S.- and European-based organizations that have created industry codes of conduct governing interactions with healthcare providers. In 2009, the company will identify industry associations in Latin America and Asia Pacific to collaborate with to develop and enhance medical device or pharmaceutical industry codes of conduct.
In 2009, Baxter will evaluate how broader anticorruption 
initiatives such as the UN Global Compact, the World
Economic Forum Partnering Against Corruption Initiative 
and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation  
and Development Principles may complement the  
company’s approach.Continue to champion internal and industrywide ethical sales and marketing practices by: 

key challenges facing the world today. 
Baxter realizes that its business activities 
impact the environment, and has made environmental stewardship a priority 
for more than three decades, applying 
the same high standards to all facilities worldwide. 
Understanding and reducing the  
company’s impacts – related to the  
materials and services it purchases from its suppliers, its manufacturing and the products it sells – is fundamental 
to Baxter’s commitment to sustainability. 
Every impact offers an opportunity  for improvement, and the company  has programs in place to enhance its performance across the entire range

Baxter works with thousands of suppliers in more than 100 countries to secure the raw materials, components, services, 
goods and transportation capabilities required for the company’s operations worldwide. As part of this global business 
community, Baxter is committed to working with its suppliers to improve their environmental performance, purchase products with reduced environmental impacts and minimize transportation-related emissions.
To better understand Baxter's suppliers' environmental performance, in 2008 the company conducted a supplier 
sustainability survey of approximately 100 of its major U.S. suppliers. Combined, these suppliers represented  
$2.2 billion or 50 percent of Baxter’s total supplier spend. See highlights in the full report online. 
£green procurement To improve the environmental impacts of its purchasing, Baxter has begun embedding 
sustainability into its formal relationships with suppliers. In 2008 in the United States and Canada, Baxter modified 
its request for proposal document to cover information about suppliers' sustainability commitment, initiatives and performance, and also added sustainability language to its standard supplier agreement. The company plans to 
incorporate that language into similar documents in all other locations in 2009. Baxter also will include sustainability 
criteria in its global supplier scorecards for direct suppliers.¹  
In early 2009, Baxter launched an Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Policy. It covers consumables, which are 
mainly office supplies, and also contributes to LEED
®² certification for existing buildings. The initial scope of the 
policy is the company’s Deerfield, Illinois, United States, headquarters, and Baxter plans to broaden the scope to all Northern Illinois facilities in the future.
One area of focus is the company’s car fleet. In the 2008-2009 lease cycle, Baxter selected cars with a higher 
advertised fuel efficiency than the ones it was replacing. However, the measured fuel efficiency actually decreased. Baxter is determining how to improve this performance in coming years to meet its 2015 goal. Baxter has efforts related to its fleet outside the United States as well. 
£product transportation Baxter works to reduce emissions related to the transportation of its products 
to customers worldwide. In the United States, Baxter requires all of its surface transport providers to participate in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay
SM program.
Shifting from more to less energy-intensive modes of transport such as truck to rail also reduces emissions. Baxter has increased the use of intermodal transport (rail and truck combined as opposed to truck only) in the United States every year since 2005, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 530 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2e) in 2008. In Europe, shifting from truck to other modes of transport reduced GHG emissions by 
more than 1,580 metric tons CO2e in 2008. Baxter plans to report transport-related emissions globally in the future.

California, United States, to support its Renal fleet, which delivers kidney 
dialysis solutions to home patients.
Baxter has implemented numerous enhancements 
since 2004 to its Renal truck fleet, such as installing onboard computers, which helped reduce idle times from 10 percent to 2 percent, and capping fleet 
speeds at 62 miles per hour. In 2009, Baxter will 
upgrade onboard computer systems, enhance fleet delivery routing software and introduce two diesel hybrids to the Renal fleet. The company projects that these changes, combined with ongoing upgrades, will reduce fleet emissions 18-20 percent in 2009 compared to 2008.
Starting in July 2008, Baxter offset the GHG emissions  
associated with all product deliveries from the company’s Northampton, United Kingdom (UK), distribution center to customers in the UK (more

Global climate change, caused by the increase of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere since  
the beginning of the industrial revolution, is the most pressing environmental issue of this generation. Responding  
successfully to this challenge will require all elements of society – individuals, businesses, cities, states and  
nations – to take meaningful and timely action.
Addressing global climate change and reducing GHG emissions is fundamental to Baxter’s commitment to sustainability. 
Key focus areas for the company include energy management, use of renewable energy and emissions trading.  
See additional aspects of Baxter’s approach in the full report online.
£energy m anagement Baxter’s global energy management program is focused on minimizing company 
energy use and cost, which helps to reduce energy-related GHG emissions. See page 13 for more detail and an example of energy conservation. 
One example of an energy management project that will reduce Baxter’s carbon intensity is the installation of a  
3 megawatt cogeneration system approved in 2009 for Baxter’s Castlebar, Ireland, facility. This project will generate 
electricity and steam from natural gas, a lower carbon fuel than heavy fuel oil. Heavy fuel oil is currently used and until recently was the only fuel available at the facility. 
£renewa Ble energy Baxter increased facility energy usage of renewable power to 16 percent of total energy 
usage in 2008, compared to 15 percent in 2005. In 2008, the company installed solar energy systems in China, Portugal and Spain, and plans to identify more sites in 2009. 
In 2008, the company also purchased 29,500 megawatt hours of certified renewable energy certificates in the 
United States (the 25th largest corporate purchaser in the United States as of January 2009).¹ Baxter has achieved 
carbon neutrality by offsetting GHG emissions associated with on-site fuel consumption and electricity use at three 
sites globally, including Baxter’s corporate complex in Deerfield, Illinois, United States. In some cases, Baxter also has purchased renewable energy certificates to offset GHG emissions associated with product manufacturing and product delivery to customers. See page 15 for detail. 
£emissions t rading Carbon cap-and-trade systems are emerging in various regions and countries in the  
world. These market-based systems can play an important role in facilitating the reduction of certain GHG emissions. 
Baxter participates in the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.  Baxter 
is monitoring the development of other carbon-trading systems worldwide, including in China and India.“ Baxter has shown leadership by reporting 
its greenhouse gas emissions and climate 
change strategies through the Carbon 
Disclosure Project since 2002 and through 
recognition in 2008 in the Carbon Disclosure  
Leadership Index, for its high-quality  
disclosure on climate change-related issues. ”

and a 21% reduction indexed to revenue. <<OUR OPERATIONS ANd PROdUcTS1313priority : Baxter Will Drive Reductions in its Natural Resource Use
Baxter depends on materials, energy, water and other natural resources to manufacture its products and conduct 
its business. These resources are limited, and the company has a long history of demonstrated commitment to using them wisely. The 2015 natural resource goals are a part of Baxter's third generation of environmental goals and reflect issues that are important to the company’s operations, customers and other stakeholders.
£waste Baxter's main source of non-hazardous waste is plastics scrap generated from manufacturing, and its 
main source of regulated waste is biological and blood-derived plasma wastes from plasma processing activities. Waste-reduction efforts during 2008 focused especially on the largest production sites. For example, the company’s Guayama, Puerto Rico, plant reduced waste by more than 2,000 metric tons (66 percent) compared to 2007 by 
improving the efficiency of cleaning operations and the accuracy of waste-generation data. See the Waste section  
in the full report online for information about the Guayama, Puerto Rico, facility’s 2007 performance.
Historically, Baxter's challenges with meeting its waste-reduction targets have been attributed to disposal of 
expired product that customers return and increased generation of certain wastes at a few facilities.  In 2009, 
Baxter is deploying a new information management system for its Environment, Health and Safety organization. This system will allow more timely and consistent tracking of waste generation to better enable management to respond to unfavorable trends. 
£packaging Baxter used more than 47,000 metric tons of corrugated packaging in 2008 for its products 
worldwide, and works to use these materials more efficiently. In 2008, the company reduced the packaging size for the majority of U.S. Renal solution cartons, decreasing the storage space required by customers in their homes by 30 percent. Due to this initiative, Baxter realized a corrugate reduction of 360 metric tons in the second half of 2008 
and is positioned to realize a decrease of 800 metric tons in 2009. Baxter is establishing a companywide tracking 
system in 2009 to improve reporting of packaging initiatives.

Among the facilities Baxter recognized for energy conservation practices in 2008 was São Paulo, Brazil, which decreased energy use by 4.4 percent per unit of production through projects such as a rooftop water 
evaporation system that cools the building and reduces 
process-water discharge costs. 
£water Baxter’s main use of water is for processes 
such as cooling towers, sterilizers and steam boilers  
(80 percent of total use). About 15 percent goes into the  company’s products and 5 percent is for potable uses. 
Baxter's continued success in water conservation is  
primarily due to water recovery and reuse projects at 
many locations and best practice sharing companywide. 
For example, Baxter’s Grosotto, Italy, facility reduced water consumption by 116 million liters (14 percent reduction compared to 2007) through sterilizer water recovery and cooling water optimization projects. In another project, four European locations are conducting water balances and creating value stream maps¹ to enhance processes 
in production lines for one of Baxter's intravenous (IV) 
products, which will save significant water and energy when completed.

Baxter is also focused on product end-of-life. For its  
electronic products, when refurbishment and reuse is  
not an option, Baxter pursues responsible recycling.  
Integrating design for disassembly into product  
development will facilitate more efficient processing. 
Baxter’s product stewardship programs also address  
other issues that generally arise in the research and  
design phase of the product life cycle, including issues 
related to bioethics, clinical trials and animal welfare. 
While health regulations currently require the use of animal 
testing in the development and production of healthcare 
products, Baxter is committed to minimizing animal testing. 
In early 2009, Baxter added a product stewardship goal of identifying additional opportunities to replace, reduce 
and refine (“
3Rs”) the use of animal testing. Baxter looks 
forward to adding to the number of successful innovations 
it has introduced in this area over the years.

priority : Baxter Will Drive Enhanced Product Stewardship
Baxter sells more than 100 million cases of products each year. The manufacture, transport, use and ultimate 
disposal of these products can impact the environment by using energy, materials and other resources. Baxter manages these impacts through its product stewardship programs.
The design stage offers a unique opportunity to influence a product's environmental, health and safety performance, so Baxter includes a Product Sustainability Review (PSR) during the early stages of product development. PSR focuses on medical devices, ranging from intravenous (IV) solution containers to dialysis machines. 
An initial screen reveals high-level environmental and health and safety risks and opportunities at the concept 
phase, and a comprehensive review then identifies improvement opportunities across the life cycle. Baxter uses these results to confirm product feasibility, help establish product requirements and minimize potential product 
impacts to human health and the environment. PSR also provides a channel to integrate compliance considerations 
for existing and upcoming product-related regulations.¹  
In 2008, Baxter enhanced the PSR screen for toxic chemicals. This will help the company meet growing  
customer demands and will also help Baxter prepare for potential chemical restrictions under the European Union REACH regulation. 
Since 2005, Baxter has used PSR to evaluate all new medical devices reaching the concept stage of development, and currently has several devices under review. 
£product e xamples Baxter offers a number of IV medications, parenteral nutrition solutions, injectable 
drugs, biopharmaceuticals, access systems, administration devices and other products that use or are contained in non-PVC or non-DEHP [di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate] materials. See the Materials Use section in the full report online for more information about materials used, including PVC, in Baxter products.
In the United Kingdom in 2008, one of Baxter's non-PVC IV containers became the company’s first product to receive 
the CarbonNeutral

equivalent (CO2e) to balance the emissions from sourcing and delivery of raw materials, product manufacturing, 
delivery and use, and finally disposal of the packaging.

priority : Baxter Will Strengthen Access to Healthcare through Product  
Development, Strategic Philanthropic Giving and Product Donations
More than a billion people worldwide lack adequate access to healthcare. The affordability and availability of 
healthcare is further impacted by a challenging macroeconomic environment worldwide, in developing economies and developed countries alike. Helping to address this global challenge is a key theme in Baxter’s commitment to sustainability. The company’s broad approach includes product development, strategic philanthropic giving and product donations targeted at those most in need.
While access to healthcare is a challenge worldwide, companies have an opportunity to deliver healthcare solutions 
specifically for those at the “base of the pyramid” (BoP).¹ Although Baxter has worked in emerging economies for numerous years, developing products particularly suited to those at the BoP is an emerging area of its sustainability and business strategy.
I
n 2008, Baxter began to analyze its portfolio to identify existing products as well as product development 
opportunities to meet the needs of these populations. Current products particularly well suited to emerging 
economies and potentially to the BoP have the following characteristics: long shelf life, little or no required refrigeration, low dependency on healthcare infrastructure (such as hospitals, clinics and skilled medical staff), non-complex technology and low cost. In 2009, Baxter will develop a list of the highest potential product oppor -
tunities and assess the feasibility of making those products more accessible.
Baxter also assessed research and development (R&D) investment levels in this area in 2008, which will help the company set targets to increase future spending.
Working closely with organizations that focus on the main disease states related to Baxter's businesses such as 
hemophilia and immune disorders is another way that Baxter promotes access to healthcare. In 2008, the company established a council to collect and review Baxter's U.S. cash philanthropic contributions. Decision-making is decentralized, as local managers and employees can best determine the appropriateness of a contribution in their 18PrOGress uPd Ate
¹  The term “base of the pyramid” refers to the roughly four billion people who 
live on less than $4 per day per capita, mostly in developing countries. Many 
companies have typically developed and marketed products and services for 
people at the “top of the pyramid.” In recent years, more companies have extended product and service offerings to the “middle of the pyramid,” often referred to as an “emerging economy” strategy. 
more online: sustainability.baxter.com/ community_supportcommunity. The council assesses how to most effectively 
use these data to guide Baxter’s efforts to enhance healthcare  
in ways that are globally relevant and applicable to all of 
the company’s businesses.
Product donations also play an important role in making Baxter products available to people in need. Baxter  
works with product donation partners that extend its reach – primarily AmeriCares and Direct Relief Interna-
tional – to understand their supply needs and help make 
critical products available where and when needed. In 2008, Baxter donated and shipped $10.9 million of medical products to benefit people in 58 countries. 
As part of these donations, Baxter provides targeted support in times of crisis. For example, the company assisted individuals affected by an earthquake in China and a cyclone in Myanmar, both in 2008, by donating 
nearly $2.4 million in Baxter products to humanitarian 
organizations working in the affected regions.
Baxter also facilitates access to its products through 
support of non-profit organizations such as the World Federation of Hemophilia. Baxter is a founding member and lead contributor to the organization’s Global Alliance for Progress (GAP) program, which works to improve the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia in developing countries. Baxter donated more than 600,000 units of 
recombinant factor VIII to the GAP program in 2008.
Finally, Baxter contributes products through its patient 
assistance programs, which provide continued access to products when a patient experiences a lapse in insurance coverage or faces other challenges that limit access. 
These contributions equaled $2.54 million in 2008.

According to the Nation’s Report Card™, only 29 percent of U.S. fourth-grade students, 29 percent of eighth-graders 
and 18 percent of 12th-graders performed at or above the proficient level in science.¹ Just 39 percent of fourth-graders and 32 percent of eighth-graders performed at or above the proficient level in math.² 
As a science- and technology-based company, Baxter has a responsibility to help ensure that current students as well 
as future generations have every opportunity to learn and be inspired by math and science. In 2008, the company 
initiated its first formal effort in advancing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education by unveiling a program aimed at students 
and teachers in the Chicago area, where Baxter is 
headquartered. 
Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with 
Real-World Science in October 2008. This five-year commitment to the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) will provide funding and hands-on experience with Baxter employees who volunteer to train teachers and encour -
age
 students to explore biotechnology. During that time, 
Science@Work is expected to reach up to 90 percent of CPS biology teachers (about 450) and more than 65 
percent of current CPS high school students (nearly 75,000). The initiative introduced its teacher training modules in Fall 2008, and the first 91 teachers will receive biotechnology training by the end of the 2008-2009 academic year. 
As part of Science@Work, Baxter partnered with Lindblom Math and Science Academy in Chicago’s underserved 
Englewood community to establish the school’s Biotechnology Center of Excellence. The Center will train CPS science 
teachers on how to incorporate biotechnology into their classrooms, and will teach Lindblom students biotechnology fundamentals. Baxter will also support the Illinois Institute of Technology’s Instructional Development System Program, which offers professional development in biotechnology to teachers at participating Chicago schools. 
Additionally, through Science@Work, Baxter will partner with Noble Street Network and Instituto del Progreso Latino 
to take an active role in opening two new public schools as part of Chicago's Renaissance 2010 initiative, designed to create 100 new public schools of exceptional quality in underserved communities by 2010. Baxter employee volunteers also share their passion for science with CPS students through classroom visits and field trips to Baxter facilities. In 2008, more than 60 students visited Baxter to talk with scientists about their jobs. Baxter will measure the success of these programs 
for the next several years and will assess how to best 
share the company's experience with other key audiences.
Additionally, through Junior Achievement, America's largest and oldest financial literacy organization, Baxter volunteers teach students ages 6 to 18 the basics of free enterprise to help them succeed in the global economy. Baxter is also a 
founding sponsor of FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition 
of Science and Technology), which, among other activities, helps students design and build robots.
Moreover, Baxter has traditionally supported education through programs such as The Baxter International 
 
Foundation’s employee Matching Gift and Dollars for Doers programs, and through volunteer efforts by facilities and employees. In 2008, Baxter employees devoted more than 
140,000 volunteer hours to a variety of organizations, a 
portion of which supported education initiatives worldwide.
