The year 2020 presented unprecedented challenges for MGM Resorts – 
our people, our guests and our communities. Our properties closed for 
several months, travel and tourism industries were profoundly disrupted, 
the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in catastrophic human and economic 
consequences, and the conscience of the United States was galvanized by 
profound calls for racial justice. 
Amid chaos and loss, one thing was clear: the importance of our core values 
and our commitment to social impact and sustainability had never been more 
meaningful, nor more urgently needed. At MGM Resorts, we have long believed 
businesses have a responsibility to communities. During the challenging 
months of 2020, we reinforced our core values through action. Our dedication 
remained Focused on What Matters as events compelled us to meet the 
moment and live our long-standing beliefs in new and innovative ways.
We swiftly overhauled our operations to ensure the health and safety of our 
guests and employees, and took decisive action to further the tenets of our 
social impact and sustainability strategy. 
Highlights of these efforts included: 
• Developing the MGM Seven-Point Safety Plan and training protocols, 
which allowed us to safely reopen to guests, put employees back to work 
and greatly reduce the likelihood of Covid-19 transmission among guests 
and employees at our properties. 
• Procuring nearly 1 million articles of personal protective equipment for 
state and local Covid-19 relief efforts and providing logistical support for 
their delivery. 
• Donating 662,000 pounds of food, or 552,000 meals, to food banks in the 
communities where we operate (significantly contributing to a total of  
1.1 million meals we donated in the calendar year).
• Expanding the MGM Resorts Foundation Employee Emergency Grant Fund 
to provide over $15 million for bill payments on behalf of employees (current 
and former) who experienced financial hardships as a result of the crisis. • Launching Courageous Conversations with diverse groups of MGM 
employees to develop actionable ideas for enhancing diversity 
and inclusion efforts within our organization and across our local 
communities. 
• Completing substantial construction on the MGM Resorts Mega Solar 
Array in North Las Vegas. 
We write this letter while continuing to face challenges and impacts, yet we 
look to the remainder of 2021 and the future with hope, renewed purpose 
and optimism. Science, medicine and human ingenuity have delivered 
vaccines and the promise of long-term recovery.
Through this letter, with the content of this report, and as evidenced by 
the range of Social Impact & Sustainability policies available on our public 
website (mgmresorts.com/focused), we reaffirm our commitment to the 
United Nations Global Compact and to the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals.
We are immensely proud of our employees and partners, who saw our 
company through this difficult time and came together to support and care 
for one another. Each page of this report demonstrates our commitment to 
the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategies and practices 
that matter most to our stakeholders. This is a promise more meaningful 
today than ever before. By dedicating ourselves to embracing humanity 
and protecting the planet, we resolve to continue leveraging our leadership 
position to drive positive change and greater environmental, social and 
economic value in the years to come. A LETTER FROM BILL HORNBUCKLE AND ROSE MCKINNEY-JAMES

CHIEF PEOPLE, INCLUSION 
AND SUSTAINABILITY 
OFFICERThe events of the past year inflicted immense heartache and anxiety in our 
communities and among our colleagues, thousands of whom experienced 
the impact of furloughs, unemployment and extreme hardship, including 
sickness and loss. While these dual health and economic crises were 
difficult, especially for the travel and hospitality industry, corporate leaders 
everywhere were called upon to reprioritize efforts and allocate resources for 
greater impact.  
At MGM Resorts, as the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic became clear, 
we immediately reassessed our social impact and sustainability priorities 
and focused our efforts on the health and safety of our working employees 
and caring for those waiting to return to employment.  
And, even while vaccines are more widely available and the promise of long-
term recovery is closer at hand, the impact of the pandemic on our people 
and community partners is expected to be considerable for the foreseeable 
future. As such, we will continue efforts to support our colleagues and local 
communities. This report explores the scope and impact of our philanthropic 
work during 2020 and beyond, along with progress made in our efforts to 
Foster Diversity & Inclusion and to Protect the Planet.  
While it was indeed a challenging year, we still achieved several notable 
accomplishments, many of which are detailed in this report. One significant 
milestone was the completion of MGM Resorts’ first formal ESG Materiality 
Assessment through which we obtained internal and external stakeholder 
input on our priority ESG issues and related strategies. The findings from 
the assessment helped us refine and augment our go-forward approach and 
triggered a significant increase in the scope and scale of the quantitative 
ESG metrics we will disclose publicly. Throughout this difficult period we retained a commitment to the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Principles of the United 
Nations Global Compact:  
• We publicly released policies on human rights and against human   
 trafficking.  
• We refreshed and updated our human capital strategy with deeper  
 integration of diversity & inclusion.  
• We released new environmental programs and goals.  
• We continued our long-term focus on anti-corruption and anti-money  
 laundering as expressed in our Code of Conduct and Compliance Charter.
I am incredibly proud of our teams for all they did to lift up our employees 
and support our communities. In the face of daunting challenges, the work 
featured throughout this report confirms that our commitment to Focus On 
What Matters is authentically felt and deeply woven into the fabric of our 
culture at MGM Resorts. 
Human compassion and corporate stewardship underpin our company’s 
response during turbulent times like these, and are characteristics that drive 
loyalty, engagement and enduring success. We look forward to the long-
term recovery of our business, the health and well-being of our neighbors 
and our continuing role in building a just and equitable society and cleaner, 
sustainable world for all people. A LETTER FROM JYOTI CHOPRA

In 2019, MGM Resorts established an ESG task 
force comprised of executives from strategy, investor 
relations, risk, finance, purchasing and other 
functions. One of their primary tasks was to develop 
and execute a formal materiality assessment to help 
the company prioritize ESG issues based on internal 
and external stakeholder input. The findings from this 
assessment, completed in Q1 2020, are summarized 
in the adjacent matrix. 
As shown, Climate Change was deemed the 
highest priority ESG issue by internal and external 
stakeholders, while Human Capital Management 
(HCM) and Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) were assessed 
as the most material social issues.  
It should be noted that the unprecedented Covid-19 
pandemic of 2020 made health, safety and well-
being a more relevant issue than what was indicated 
by our 2020 assessment. As a result, we elevated 
this issue above what the initial assessment 
recommended. We created a Health and Safety 
Center of Excellence and established a Seven-
Point Health and Safety Plan. We also launched 
new initiatives to help convention clients convene 
with confidence and significantly increased our 
philanthropic giving focused on Covid-19 assistance 
and emergency relief. ESG TASK FORCE AND MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

MGM Resorts is committed to taking strong and principled 
stands on issues of equality and aims to better unify our 
world. When racial injustices came to the forefront of 2020, it 
accelerated conversations on diversity, equity and inclusion.  
We knew it was important to speak out against the injustices 
that were occurring in our country, many of which were targeted 
against members of the Black and Asian communities. We took 
the approach of demonstrating empathy, creating a safe space 
for dialogue and making the commitment to taking action.
Another part of our dedication to inclusivity is maintaining 
relationships with diverse businesses and helping provide them 
with the tools and resources needed to be viable contributors 
to our nation’s economy. As health and safety protocols 
became a priority in 2020, we worked with our diverse business 
partners to acquire over $10 million in personal protective 
equipment. Collaboration with our employees and business 
partners support our value of diversity and inclusion by building 
trust, transparency and understanding. 
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is captured in our 
platform “Focused on What Matters: Embracing Humanity 
& Protecting the Planet.” This commitment is formally 
implemented through three strategic priorities: People, Culture 
and Suppliers & Customers.   
In terms of People, our strategy begins with attracting, 
developing and retaining diverse talent and ensuring that 
talent has equal access to leadership opportunities. We do 
that by continuously working to embed diversity and inclusion 
across our HR practices, from onboarding, to mentoring, to 
succession planning and promotion. We fundamentally believe 
that harnessing the power of diversity leads to breakthrough 
thinking and innovation in our company. This belief extends to 
our supplier and customer base as well. GENDER

By embedding diversity and inclusion into our business 
strategies, we are more directly able to attract diverse 
segments of society to our resorts and entertainment offerings. 
And, by actively seeking to buy from and offer mentorship to 
diverse suppliers, we not only ensure a more resilient supply 
chain but support the economic development of the very 
communities in which we operate.

MGM Resorts International / mgmresorts.comCOURAGEOUS CONVERSATIONS ON THE 
CALL FOR CHANGE
Last year was also a time in which the struggle against racial 
injustice was at the forefront. Civil unrest erupted around the 
nation following the death of George Floyd at the hand of police 
officers in Minneapolis.   
Public opinion of racism and discrimination generated dialogue 
around the world as people from all backgrounds called for 
change. We at MGM Resorts, recognize that we can do better 
when it comes to standing up for the intrinsic rights and value 
of all people. This required a willingness from the company 
to have real conversations that bring to light concerns and a 
determination to bring about positive change.  
It was in this spirit that MGM launched its Courageous 
Conversations cohort program – a series of open forums whereby 
leadership meets with groups of diverse employees to discuss where and how MGM can improve inclusion of diverse populations 
within leadership and across the workforce.   
The first forum included a cohort of over 30 Black employees from 
all levels of management within the company. The goal was to 
have a conversation about the current climate focused on racial 
inequality and injustice in America with an emphasis on MGM’s 
external responses as well as improvements that the company 
can pursue that help the career trajectory for current and future 
employees. Three key areas were identified as opportunities for 
improvement.   
One area of concern centered around the lack of Black 
representation at certain levels within the company. In response, 
MGM’s talent management team is working with leadership 
to identify ways to help high-performing Black employees 
advance within their careers and to broaden our sources of Black 
recruitment.  
Another area of focus relates to the need for increasing awareness 
among employees at all levels of the company of implicit bias. We are looking at ways to better formalize and improve implicit 
bias training and deliver far more robust inclusion curriculum and 
education across the company.   
Finally, MGM has long sought to increase the number of Black-
owned vendors with whom we work. But, while our goals are 
appropriately placed, the cohort identified a lack of buy-in 
from some department leads, who don’t always understand 
the importance of achieving these goals when establishing 
relationships with outside vendors. As a result, methods to 
establish greater accountability around these goals will be 
pursued. 
In partnership with leadership, the cohort was actively involved 
in developing the action plans to address these concerns and will 
continually monitor and manage their progress.   
Over the course of 2021, MGM will add additional cohorts of 
employees representing various demographics such as Hispanics 
and Latinos, Asians, women and LGBTQ+ individuals to hear their 
voices and continue on the path to more positive change.

LEVERAGING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
FOR EQUALITY
Since 2003, MGM Resorts has required diversity participation in all 
biddable commodity purchases of more than $3,000. Our company’s 
commitment to inclusion remained strong in the midst of the Covid-19 
pandemic and temporary closure of our resorts. We engaged over 500 
diverse suppliers — all of which are owned and operated by women, 
Black, Asian, Native American, Hispanic, LGBTQ, disabled persons 
and/or Veteran business owners. Several businesses pivoted to acquire 
personal protective equipment, and many supplies were required 
to keep our employees and guests safe and to securely operate our 
properties. These diverse businesses are located within communities 
across the country where we live and operate our resorts.  
“In 2020, we maintained our standards of inclusion in procurement 
and still achieved incremental growth toward our goal of at least a 10% 
biddable spend paid to diverse-owned business,” said Kenyatta Lewis, 
Executive Director of Supplier Diversity & Sustainable Procurement. 
One key initiative was securing cloth face coverings. Employees at 
all of our properties were issued cloth face masks as part of their 
uniforms. And as our resorts began to reopen and welcome guests, 
it was critical to have the items needed to help them have a safe and 
enjoyable stay. Amenity kits became the solution. One Las Vegas 
minority-owned business within our network, Eagle Promotions, 
a custom apparel provider and graduate of our Supplier Diversity 
Mentorship program, printed 20,000 masks with property logos within 
48 hours for the initial order.   
The masks were then transported to Opportunity Village, a Las 
Vegas nonprofit that provides programs and services for people with 
disabilities where amenity kits were assembled. The kits also included 
packs of alcohol wipes, “Covid keys” for touchless entry and hand 
sanitizers, all supplied by diverse businesses. Within a month, our 
longtime friends at Opportunity Village assembled more than 85,000 
kits for MGM Grand, New York-New York and Bellagio, and continued 
with other luxury properties as they opened. In just five months,  
MGM Resorts received nearly one million kits.

MENTORING AND RESOURCES  
HELP SMALL BUSINESS DURING 
TOUGH TIMES
Given the economic challenges of 2020, our Supplier Diversity 
Mentorship Program proved even more vital in helping our 
emerging diverse-owned suppliers pivot and survive during the 
pandemic. For the past four years, the program has provided 
minority- and women-owned businesses with support from 
subject matter experts at MGM Resorts, as well as business 
resources to enhance suppliers’ leadership skillsets and 
operational efficiencies to compete in any corporate supply 
chain. The program was expanded to help address Covid-
19’s impact on small businesses. Over 100 diverse suppliers 
participated in several workshops and webinars throughout 
the year conducted by MGM staff and community partners 
on topics such as economic empowerment, how to grow in 
turbulent times and developing impactful short-term business 
strategies in the new normal.   
Lord & Mitchell, a 
Maryland-based, Black 
woman-owned company, 
benefitted from these 
resources and was able to 
successfully provide over 
34,000 cartons of sanitizer 
wipes to MGM Resorts 
properties nationwide. 
Owner Toya Mitchell 
(pictured right) has been 
an MGM supplier since 
2012, serving our MGM 
National Harbor resort 
before it was developed. Here is what she shared about her 
experience: “I would like to thank you, MGM, for your advocacy 
over the years. I can say without a doubt that you are the best 
of the best at what you do for small, minority businesses. Our 
partnership with MGM has been a wonderful opportunity to 
grow our business and expand our product offerings.”MGM Resorts’ Learning Experiences Accelerate Development 
(LEAD) program offers professional development for 
employees in partnership with our employee network groups 
(ENGs). The hybrid program curriculum is designed to 
foster enterprise-wide collaboration and provide employees 
at all levels access to leadership. It is also grounded in an 
awareness of unconscious bias and diversity- and inclusion-
focused best practices.  
Covid-19 impacted the way people work and interact, but the 
participants adapted, and the LEAD program was modified 
to accommodate a changing landscape. Elements such 
as coaching, mentoring, volunteerism and ENG meetings 
became virtual, the program curriculum was entirely 
e-learning based and participants engaged in an internal 
support network to help everyone adapt to the changes.  
“LEAD has strengthened my professional development,  
which has deepened my personal growth,” said James Harris, a Sales Associate Lead at Bellagio and 2020 LEAD 
graduate. James says the program helped him learn how to 
handle his emotions, environment and time management, 
and he is able to apply the skills in both his personal and 
professional life.  
The self-directed program has three tracks: Emerging 
Leaders, Transitional Leaders and The Inclusive Leader. 
Graduation requires participation in at least one track. 
However, some participants took advantage of the slow 
business period. Michael Grema, a Front Desk Associate 
at The Signature, successfully completed all of the course 
curricula for all three LEAD tracks.   
“It was remarkable to see an employee like Michael take the 
initiative to develop as an inclusive leader by leveraging each 
component of LEAD,” said Alexander Quizon, MGM Resorts 
Senior Diversity & Inclusion Business Consultant.

In 2020, we refreshed our Philanthropy and Community 
Engagement strategy in support of our long-range 2025 Social 
Impact & Sustainability goals and to further align with specific 
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). We established a 
set of strategic priorities for our Philanthropy and Community 
Engagement efforts: on Workforce Development, Education 
and Food Security. These support SDG 8: Decent Work and 
Economic Growth, SDG 4: Quality Education and SDG 2: Zero 
Hunger respectively.   
While our giving and volunteering efforts do extend beyond 
these three themes, we deemed these three areas most 
strategically relevant to our business and the communities in 
which we operate and therefore worthy of prioritization. 
We have multiple desired outcomes from our Philanthropy and 
Community Engagement efforts. These include, but are not 
limited to: 
• Strengthen the economic livelihood, capacity and resiliency 
of communities encompassing MGM’s employee and 
customer footprint • Help develop sustainable institutions, smart cities  
and ecosystems 
•  Support good jobs, meaningful careers, work and wages 
• Promote next-gen skills development, career training  
and retooling • Collaborate with public sector, policy makers,  
educators and nonprofits 
We plan to achieve these outcomes by promoting a culture 
of inclusion and philanthropy, and by actively encouraging 
employee volunteering and giving.COMMITTED TO COMMUNITIES
As a company, we take seriously our responsibility within the 
communities in which we operate. The devastating impacts of 
the Covid-19 pandemic presented unforeseen challenges, but 
it also reminded us that we are stronger together. Colleagues, 
neighbors and friends quickly joined forces to ensure basic 
needs were met, from coast to coast and around the world. 
We continue to focus on our commitment to the communities 
that have welcomed us, giving generously to our neighbors and 
embodying our core value of embracing humanity every day. 
We are passionately committed to active engagement through 
volunteerism, community and civic engagement and philan -
thropic opportunities — from global commitments to meeting 
local area needs.

MGM Resorts International / mgmresorts.comPERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
As great as the need for food was among families and 
individuals within our communities, we also knew there was a 
significant shortage of PPE for our medical professionals.  
MGM Resorts quickly teamed up with the Nevada Covid-19 Task 
Force to assist. By leveraging our supply chain, procurement 
capabilities, distribution systems, supplier network and other 
resources, we provided urgent logistical support to help manage 
supply shortages of critical items. Through our colleagues in 
Macau, we procured and delivered 261,000 gowns, 200,000 
gloves, and 500,000 KN-95 masks to the state of Nevada.  At MGM Resorts, we believe our employees truly reflect the 
best in humanity. In a normal year, thousands of employees can 
be found volunteering in service to their communities. Within 
the first few months of 2020, Covid-19 changed the landscape 
of this service. In March 2020, we shut down all our U.S. 
properties as a preventative measure, prioritizing the health and 
safety of our employees and guests. As the public health crisis 
quickly devolved into an economic one, people lost their jobs, 
schools closed, and medical professionals found themselves in 
desperate need of personal protective equipment (PPE). With 
the same spirit and energy normally channeled into community 
volunteerism, our employees found new ways to aid in mitigating 
the many social challenges generated by this crisis.

It became clear early on that the ramifications of the pandemic 
shutdown were profound. Our executive chefs quickly 
mobilized to safely donate all available fresh food from our 
properties to charitable organizations serving those in need. 
Executive Chef Anthony Amoroso, one of the champions of 
our long-standing Feeding Forward program, was one of the 
leaders who took charge to coordinate the major logistical 
effort to rescue as much food as possible during the early 
months of the pandemic. “MGM Resorts is well known for our 
award-winning menus and exclusive food and beverage dining 
experiences,” said Chef Amoroso. “But we also have a long 
history of distributing food to those in need. When Covid hit, we immediately knew it was time to align and make a plan. 
Our teams came together to ensure that the fresh food at 
our resorts was collected, packaged and transferred safely 
in record time. We’ll continue to connect with our partners 
and distribute meals back into our communities as the 
opportunities arise. We’re proud to help however we can.”
Thanks to the tenacity of our chefs and our long-standing 
community partnerships, within days of shutting down, 
MGM Resorts donated more than 662,000 pounds of food—
or 552,000 meals– to the communities in which we operate. 
In Southern Nevada, we donated 444,000 pounds of food, equivalent to 370,000 meals. Throughout the rest of the U.S., 
we donated an additional 219,000 pounds of food, equivalent 
to 182,000 meals.
During most of the month of April, MGM Resorts’ chefs cooked 
and donated 1,000 hot meals daily that were distributed 
through Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada.
MGM Resorts donated more than 1.1 million meals in 2020, 
taking us to a cumulative total of 2.6 million meals donated 
since our Feeding Forward program began in 2016. This takes 
us halfway to our goal of 5 million meals donated by 2025. CHEFS COOKED 1,000

COMMITTED TO CONSERVATION
With more than 31 unique hotel and destination gaming 
offerings in the United States and Macau employing tens of 
thousands of people, MGM Resorts upholds its role in leading 
efforts to protect the planet. In the spirit of conservation, we 
are committed to creating a more environmentally sustainable 
future, while striving to make a difference in the lives of our 
employees, guests and in the communities where we operate. 
Over the last number of years, we have made significant 
progress in managing our operational environmental 
footprint. In 2020, we broadened our focus and established 
a comprehensive Sustainable Supply Chain strategy. This 
is based on our deep awareness that much of our extended 
environmental footprint is in our supply chain and ‘embedded’ 
in the products we buy from suppliers in the U.S. and around 
the world. Our strategy also integrates the concepts of social 
equity, ecological health, economic value, ensuring a well-
balanced approach to driving a positive social impact and 
sustainability through our supply chain.
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 
MGM Resorts’ Environmental Sustainability commitment  
is captured in our platform “Focused on What Matters:  
Embracing Humanity & Protecting the Planet.” We work 
to protect the planet by focusing efforts on three strategic 
priorities that address our main environmental footprints 
related to water, energy and materials.  
For each of these priorities, we recognize that to reduce 
our environmental footprints, we need to start by designing 
buildings that are efficient from the start; continue by operating 
them efficiently; and hone in on actions that are likely to make 
the most difference. For water, that means focusing most 
on reducing consumptive water use; for energy, that means 
ramping up our use of renewables; and for materials, it means

focusing on the material flows and waste associated with one

In addition, since much of our extended environmental 
footprint and risk is embedded in our supply chain, we are 
more directly connecting our social impact and sustainability 
strategy with our supply chain strategy.

PROTECTING THE PLANET: IT’S IN THE DETAILS
We recognize that to effectively bring environmental sustainability 
to life means having both a clear overall strategy and a 
commitment to get into the details. So, while we do pursue 
ambitious goals and major projects, we also bring our strategy  
to life in a myriad of detailed ways.
LED LIGHTING
We have installed over 1.4 million Light Emitting Diodes (LED)  
in one of America’s largest lighting retrofit projects.
SOLAR ELECTRICITY
At the end of 2020, MGM had 9.6MW of installed solar 
capacity. By the end of 2021, that will leap to 109.6MW 
based on the completion of our 100MW array in North 
Las Vegas.
HEATING VENTILATION & AIR CONDITIONING 
(HVAC) EFFICIENCY 
We have invested tens of millions of dollars in HVAC 
efficiency projects including multiple central plant 
upgrades and over 1,000 variable speed drives on fans, 
pumps and motors to ensure less energy is needed to 
move air and liquids around our buildings.
WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPING
In Las Vegas we converted over 200,000 square feet of 
real grass to artificial turf or desert-friendly landscape to 
help reduce our consumptive water use (water we don’t 
send back to the source).
WATER EFFICIENT EQUIPMENT & APPLIANCES
We prioritize water-efficient equipment and appliances  including 
automatic faucets for sinks; low-flow bathroom fixtures, and high-
performance commercial dishwashers.
MATERIALS DIVERSION PROGRAM
In one of the hospitality industry’s most comprehensive 
materials diversion programs we capture and divert 
over 30 materials from landfills. This includes common 
materials such as glass, metal and plastics as well as non-
traditional items such as hangers, towels and oysters.
ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PURCHASING 
We recognize that the materials we choose and products we buy 
drive much of our lifecycle environmental impact. These choices also 
affect our ability to manage waste, since some materials are more 
durable, recyclable or reusable than others. We have concentrated 
buying power in some of our markets and use that power to advance 
environmentally preferable purchasing in many categories.
SUSTAINABLE EVENTS IDEAS DECK 
Las Vegas is a global hub for meetings and conventions and sports 
and entertainment. We are very focused on helping event planners 
understand and implement more sustainable practices. Our program 
is encapsulated in a user-friendly deck of 52 Sustainable Event Ideas.
FOOD WASTE DIVERSION
As a core aspect of our overall material diversion program we also 
have a highly respected food waste diversion program. We work on 
source reduction to avoid waste being generated from the start, and 
also send tens of thousands of tons of food scraps to animals, co-
mingled food and compostable disposables to compost; and grease 
to biofuel. We also rescue unserved food to feed people in need in 
our communities.
CERTIFIED BUILDINGS
Nearly 90% of MGM Resorts’ portfolio (by square feet) is  certified 
to one or more of the following environmental certifications: LEED 
(majority LEED Gold), Green Globes, Green Key, China Green 
Building, ISO 140001 or ISO 50001.
ENVIRONMENTAL 
STRATEGY CONNECTION 
TO CLIMATE STRATEGY
Since climate change is a defining issue of our age, we consider 
each of our strategic pillars of water, energy and materials 
depicted above to be intrinsically connected to our climate 
strategy as well (not just the energy pillar as is often the case for 
many company efforts related to climate).  Our comprehensive climate strategy will be revealed later in 2021 
and will include alignment with the recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-Related Climate Disclosure (TCFD), ambitious 
Science-Based Targets (SBT) for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and 
a clear roadmap to pursue these long-term targets.

While we see our climate strategy as broader than an energy 
strategy, our energy efforts — notably increasing use of 
renewable energy — do play a key role in our approach to 
decarbonization. 
In 2020, we advanced construction of our 100 megawatt utility-
scale solar array in North Las Vegas. With over 330,000 panels 
arranged across 700 acres, the solar array powers up to 90% of the daytime electricity used at all MGM Resorts properties on the 
Las Vegas Strip — over 65 million square feet. For comparison, 
the array will generate the same amount of electricity needed to 
power approximately 27,000 homes for a year.  
This array will play a major role in helping us meet our current 
climate goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 45% 
ahead of our 2025 target year (2007 baseline).

PROCUREMENT AS AN ENABLER  
OF SOCIAL IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY
MGM Resorts is a major buyer of goods and services, and a large proportion 
of our overall spending is concentrated in our home city of Las Vegas.  
As such, we have significant market power in many purchasing categories. 
We have used this power to advance our commitment to investing in our 
communities, fostering diversity and inclusion, and protecting the planet 
while delivering economic benefits to our stakeholders.  
Recognizing this as a complex and multi-faceted area of program 
development, in 2019 and 2020 we engaged the Sustainable Purchasing 
Leadership Council (SPLC: sustainablepurchasing.org) and leveraged 
their Strategic Program Planning Process (SP3) to help us develop a 
comprehensive strategy.  
SPLC inspired us to connect and organize our previously separate work on 
supplier diversity and environmentally preferable purchasing with emerging 
work on supply chain human rights and Total Cost of Ownership into one 
holistic sustainable supply chain program.  
As this strategy unfolds, we will increasingly prioritize working with suppliers 
and procuring products and services that deliver on the core attributes 
of price competitiveness and quality but that also  help us meet our 
environmental, social and economic goals while  helping reduce our main 
environmental, social and economic risks. By doing so, we believe we will 
progressively develop a truly sustainable supply chain. 
PROCUREMENT THAT SUPPORTS OUR GOALS  
Our sustainable supply chain charter summarizes how our procurement 
efforts directly align with our stated 2025 goals for protecting the planet 
and fostering diversity and inclusion. It also clarifies how we are planning 
for emerging objectives such as quantifying Scope 3 emissions associated 
with purchased goods and services, reducing climate and water risks, and 
assessing and mitigating human rights risks in our supply chain. Since 
understanding total spend is a foundation for effective measurement of 
progress on a sustainable supply chain, we have been actively working to 
gain a clear and consistent picture of what we buy and from whom, across 
regions and countries.
MGM Resorts procurement is Focused on What Matters. We use our purchasing 
power to measurably advance the company’s mission to embrace humanity and 
protect the planet, while also delivering economic benefits to all our stakeholders.SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN CHARTER & ALIGNMENT TO GOALS

METRICS  
& GOALS
We have a range of current procurement 
projects that support our stated 2025 
Protecting the Planet goals. For example, 
to reduce water, we have sourced large 
quantities of artificial turf to replace more 
water-intensive grass at multiple properties. 
For energy, we have continued our lighting 
retrofit program and nearly replaced all of our 
over 1.5 million lights with energy-efficient 
LEDs; and for materials diversion we have 
implemented multiple product optimization 
or substitution efforts to help reduce material 
volumes and increase our material diversion 
from landfill.  
Some projects, such as our partnership with 
Ecolab to convert to a smarter ware-washing 
solution, help us make progress on multiple 
environmental goals with one purchasing 
transition. Others, such as our shift to cage-
free eggs and environmentally preferable 
copy paper, may not be tied directly to our 
14 primary social impact and sustainability 
goals, but do still help us make progress on 
issues that matter to our company and our 
stakeholders.

MGM Resorts International / mgmresorts.comMGM Resorts properties are known for providing exceptional 
dining experiences, with a reputation for delivering first-rate 
meals and unparalleled service. This focus on quality extends 
to our growing commitment to source more sustainable food 
and beverage options and meet the growing market and 
stakeholder demand for these options. 
As one of our early commitments to measurably increase our 
sustainable food offering, in February 2020, the company set 
a policy and goal to source 100 percent of eggs (shell, liquid, 
and egg products) from cage-free sources throughout our 
global portfolio before 2030. In addition, we committed to 
sourcing chickens from suppliers certified by Global Animal 
Partnership. 
We decided to have the egg come before the chicken, as it 
were, and are now proud to share that we’ve made substantial 
progress on our cage-free egg commitment. Even with property 
closures, lower guest volumes and the economic downturn 
caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, our cage-free egg spend in 
the U.S. increased from 12.7% in 2018 to 21.7% in 2020.  As the point person for this initiative, Executive Chef Anthony 
Amoroso believes that as a global leader in hospitality,  
MGM Resorts has a responsibility to lead on sustainability  
and use our purchasing power to effect positive change.  
With this in mind, Chef Amoroso wanted to take our efforts one 
step further to focus on sourcing organic, not just cage-free, 
eggs. This is because organic eggs are considered to be more 
healthy and nutritious, while also being cage free. Based on 
this effort, by the end of 2020, all of our high-end food and 
beverage outlets in Las Vegas were using organic eggs, and 
Bellagio Hotel & Casino had 100% organic eggs across all F&B 
outlets, from high end to high volume.  
We are now working to ramp up cage-free and organic egg 
sourcing at our regional properties and will increasingly 
focus on the liquid egg supply chain. After we’ve made 
substantial additional progress on our egg policy, we’ll shift 
to our chicken policy.

SMART PARTNERS  
BRING SMART RESULTS
With millions of pieces of reusable 
china, silverware, pots, pans and 
glassware needing cleaning regularly 
in the enormous dishwashers at our 
properties, MGM Resorts Director of 
Stewarding Rocky Bevevino believed 
that ware-washing could be an area 
to explore for water, energy and 
packaging efficiency. He reached 
out to our current vendor Ecolab to 
explore strategies that could maintain 
the high standards of cleanliness 
required in MGM’s more than 400 
food and beverage outlets, while also 
reducing environmental impact.  
Ecolab is a global leader in water 
treatment, purification, cleaning 
and hygiene, with a major focus 
on the hospitality segment. They 
recommended piloting their new 
SmartPower solution for commercial 
dishwashing, soaking and rinsing.  
Through an initial small-scale pilot 
at two dishwashing stations, Ecolab 
was able to indicate the potential 
for reduction in water, energy and 
packaging. An additional benefit was 
the cloud-based software that helped 
identify issues and inefficiencies at 
specific dishwashers in real time, 
thus enabling additional savings of 
energy and water.  
In 2019, a comprehensive three-
month pilot was conducted with the SmartPower solution at multiple  
high-volume commercial dishwashers 
at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino and 
Delano Las Vegas.  
The pilot demonstrated meaningful 
benefits immediately, as our wash 
cycle reduced by 11% leading to 
a corresponding estimated 11% 
reduction in water and energy use, 
all while maintaining or improving 
cleanliness. Since the new product 
line came in smaller, more compact 
packaging, there was a 96% 
reduction in plastic waste. Finally, 
since the new chemical formulations 
were milder, the need for personal 
protective equipment was eliminated, 
providing health and safety benefits 
to employees. 
The SmartPower program began 
rolling out across the company in 
the latter half of 2019 and continued 
into 2020. Approximately 75% of 
the company’s dish machines have 
converted to the new solution, with 
the remaining scheduled to transition 
as the inventory of previously 
purchased product is depleted.

ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PAPER
In 2016, we started collaborating with our office supplies vendor, 
Staples, to transition to environmentally preferable paper. We 
established a preference for paper that either contained 30% or more 
post-recycled content and/or was FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) 
certified. Since then, our environmentally preferable purchasing has 
jumped from just 4.5% of copy paper spend in 2016 to 86.9% in 2020.  
We have also partnered with Toshiba to reduce our printer fleet and 
add controls to help limit paper use. Finally, through Print Releaf, 
trees are replanted to offset the virgin fiber we use for much of our 
copy paper needs.

The people of Macau showed resilience and unity dealing with 
the pandemic and its impact under the strong leadership of 
the Chief Executive and the Macau government. Meanwhile, 
the employees of MGM China took great care to protect staff 
members, guests and the community as a whole. MGM China 
used its position as a prominent and responsible corporate 
leader to provide necessary supplies and support to various 
Macau communities and to help the region navigate the worst 
of the pandemic.   
At MGM China, sustainability is about doing well by doing 
good. To ensure the long-term success of our business, it is 
fundamental that we look after those who mean the most to 
us, including our employees, business partners, suppliers, 
customers, the community and our shareholders. It is also 
equally important to take care of the earth and its precious 
natural resources, which we depend on for life itself. 
Our Sustainability Policy outlines commitments to three 
overarching pillars: Responsible Business, Social Responsibility 
and Environmental Sustainability, with the following objectives: 
COMMITMENT TO RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  
We are committed to having governance systems in place to 
best manage sustainability risks and opportunities. We will 
include important stakeholder groups in the development 
of our sustainability programs through regular reporting and 
engagement initiatives.
Formed in 2012, the MGM Sustainability Committee 
(“Committee”) is responsible for establishing policies, 
programs and procedures that help move us towards fulfilling 
our sustainability vision and goals, and MGM China also has 
a team of dedicated professionals who are responsible for 
the daily implementation of our sustainability objectives and 
targets. To help strengthen the company’s sustainability 
policies and programs, there is continuous communication with 
key stakeholders in long-term, multi-channel dialogue.COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  
We are committed to providing employees with a great place 
to work and develop. We will give back to the community and 
invest in its long-term development and prosperity.
In 2020, MGM China donated 500,000 face masks to the 
Macau government to support its mask distribution program. 
The company also donated 100,000 child-sized masks and 
health-checking robots to the Women’s General Association of 
Macau. Both parties collaborated to launch the “Guardian of 
Love” program to distribute masks to eligible children and help 
monitor their health. 
MGM China also partnered with various community partners to 
deliver support for those in need. MGM China supplied frontline 
staff with masks, disposable caps and other necessary items, 
in partnership with Federation of Trade Unions of Macau 
(“FAOM”), General Union of Neighborhood Associations of 
Macau (“UGAMM”) and Caritas Macau. The company also 
donated anti-pandemic supplies to community organizations, 
including Tung Sin Tong, Holy House of Mercy, FAOM, UGAMM, 
Fuhong Society of Macau and Caritas Macau, which benefitted 
local community services and underprivileged families.COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL 
RESPONSIBILITY  
We will continuously work to minimize the environmental 
impacts of our business operations.
A keen supporter of green management, MGM China has 
incorporated environmentally preferable elements into its 
properties from planning and design to daily operation.  
In 2018, MGM became the first integrated resort operator 
in Macau to abandon all single-use plastics in takeaway 
packaging. Moreover, as a continuous effort to phase out the 
provision of plastic bottled water at its properties, 2020 has 
seen a 60.3% reduction (2.4 million bottles) as compared to 
when the initiative first rolled out in 2018. Additionally, seven 
new beverage stations were installed on the gaming floor to 
further reduce consumption of bottled water.  
MGM China is also committed to reducing its emissions through 
resource efficiency initiatives and by fostering climate change 
awareness and action among employees. On top of winning 
gold in the Macau Green Hotel Award, both MGM Macau 
and MGM Cotai attained the ISO 50001:2018 certification 
for effective energy management systems (“EnMS”). MGM 
Cotai is also a recipient of the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental 
Management System Certification. Its commitment to green 
buildings was recognized with major accolades, including a 
merit honor at Green Building Award, Asia Pacific Innovation 
Award from International Facility Management Association 
(IFMA) and ASHRAE Technology Award — Honorable Mention 
Winner in both Region (APAC and Society (Global) Level.

NOTES 
0.         Based on audits completed in May 2021, data for 2007 to 2020 updated from original postings on MGM Investor Relations and Social Impact & Sustainability sites on 4/28/21 and 5/6/21 respectively.
1. Any 2020 datapoint that is bold has been reviewed by the MGM Internal Audit department.
2. Only includes buildings owned or operated for the full year reporting period, except Circus Circus Las Vegas, which was divested very late in 2019. ARIA Convention Center expanded in 2018. MGM Cotai and MGM Springfield opened in 2018, but square footage and operational metrics are reflected for 2019 and 
beyond. MGM Grand Conference Center and Park MGM expanded in 2019. Non-material updates to square footage data for prior years has been restated per newly available source information.
3. Includes Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for New Construction, LEED for Commercial Interiors, Green Globes for New Construction and China Green Building (Macau).
4. Includes Green Globes for Existing Buildings, Green Key, Green Key Meetings, ISO 14001, ISO 50001. Some buildings have multiple certifications.

Actual well water use data became available from regional water authorities in 2020; previously we used well water allocation as 
proxy for withdrawal as actual withdrawal was not available.
10. Materials disposed includes: landfill, waste-to-energy, incineration, food-to-waste-water.
11. Materials diverted includes: Organics: e.g., food to farms, compost, organics, yellow and brown grease to biofuel, horticulture to farms/compost; Recycled: e.g., metal, plastic, paper, cardboard; Donated/liquidated: e.g., furniture, assets, food to charity.
12. No major new construction development projects initiated in 2019 or 2020.
