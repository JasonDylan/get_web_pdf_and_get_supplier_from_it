A better future 
for everyone
2016 Corporate Responsibility SupplementOur approach to corporate responsibility extends to our customers, suppliers and 
employees, as well as our communities. Reflecting the values embodied in our Credo, 
we are committed to ensuring our customers’ privacy and data security, pursuing 
best practices in diversity and inclusion, and improving the diversity and sustainability standards of our supply chain. We encourage our employees
—the V Team —to 
partner with us in our efforts through volunteerism and monetary support, and they 
have responded magnificently to the challenge of improving the quality of life in the 
communities where we live and work.
While we’re proud of our accomplishments, we are always conscious that there’s 
more to do. You’ll see in these pages that we take a disciplined approach to setting goals, measuring our progress and continuously improving our processes. In the 
year ahead, we will continue to raise our sights and reach for aggressive goals as we 
strive to deliver the promise of the digital age. I am proud to stand with the thousands of Verizon employees as we strive to live up to our Credo and create a better, more 
connected world for the people and communities we serve.

Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer & President,  
Verizon Foundation
President’s letter
Verizon’s commitment to corporate responsibility 
is rooted in a simple but powerful belief, expressed in the Credo to which all our 160,000 employees 
aspire: “We are good corporate citizens and  
share our success with the community to  
make the world in which we work better than  
it was yesterday.” 
This deep-rooted belief in the power of our people and technology to effect positive 
change has taken on new urgency in the digital age, as we have both new challenges 
to meet and new tools with which to address them.
We firmly believe in the concept of shared success —that is, the idea that our 
technology has the power to help people lead better lives, solve problems in new ways 
and create lasting value both for Verizon and for society. In this report, we share the 
progress we made in 2016 in turning that idea into reality in the communities we serve.
As you will see, we have focused our corporate responsibility efforts on a few key 
areas in which our technology can be most transformational. 
For example, millions of young people in underserved communities lack the tools, 
skills and resources to participate fully in the opportunities of the digital age. We’re addressing this critical education gap through our Verizon Innovative Learning 
initiative, which reached more than 200,000 students in 2016, as well as a national 
campaign called #weneedmore  that calls attention to this important issue. 
Another focus area is domestic violence prevention, where we have seen that our communications technology provides an essential lifeline for at-risk women and children. And, increasingly, we’re finding that product innovations in the emerging 
market for the Internet of Things give us new tools for creating a more sustainable 
environment, helping us and our customers save water, use energy more efficiently and reduce our carbon intensity.Corporate

4Shared  successVerizon Innovative Learning:  
connecting underserved youth to  
the skills of tomorrow
One of the country’s biggest challenges is 
preparing today’s students for the jobs of the future in a 21st century digital economy. 
Jobs in science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics (STEM) are growing at nearly twice the rate of those in other fields, yet far too many young people in underserved 
communities lack adequate access to 
technology and STEM education to take full advantage of these opportunities.
By preparing students from diverse backgrounds to participate in the digital economy, 
we not only equip young people from economically challenged areas to build better 
futures, we also strengthen communities and make businesses such as Verizon 
more competitive.
Verizon is committed to connecting underserved youth to the skills of tomorrow.
Verizon Innovative Learning (VIL)  provides free technology, free internet access, 
and immersive, hands-on learning curricula to students and teachers, particularly in 
underserved communities across America. Through VIL, we develop and fund STEM education programs and administer them in partnership with leading nonprofits. We 
also engage students through a nationwide app challenge and targeted programs for 
minority boys and girls.
In 2017 we will broaden our efforts to connect more young people to the  
opportunities of the digital world. We have launched a national campaign called 
#weneedmore, which calls attention to this crucial issue and encourages others  
to join us at www.weneedmore.com .

7Shared  successHopeLine: empowering survivors of domestic violence
The plague of domestic violence affects every community, in  
visible and not-so-visible ways —  destroying families, fracturing 
communities and throwing its victims’ lives into disarray. 
We have found that communications technology can be a powerful tool for knitting those frayed social structures 
back together and empowering survivors to put their lives back on track. Verizon established our HopeLine program 
in 2001 to help prevent domestic violence and benefit its survivors. Through HopeLine, we collect and resell used 
mobile devices, using the proceeds to provide cash grants to organizations and agencies working to prevent domestic violence. HopeLine also donates mobile phones and service plans to survivors of domestic violence, giving 
them the means to contact their support network. Learn more about our HopeLine  program .

9Shared  successInnovative technology: 
creating smarter solutions 
As wireless internet connections 
are embedded in an increasing number of everyday products 
and objects —  a phenomenon 
known collectively as the 
Internet of Things (Io T) —  Verizon 
is using its expertise in wireless 
connectivity, cloud and data 
analytics to create “smart” solutions in fields ranging from agriculture to healthcare to traffic management. 
Not only do these innovations create new growth 
opportunities for Verizon, they also give our customers 
new tools for solving business problems, creating more 
efficient communities and delivering services. In the process, they expand our definition of shared success.Saving  
children’s livesIn partnership with Children’s National Medical Center  in Washington, D.C., 
Verizon technology helped screen more than 6,000 children in rural Brazil for a 
fatal heart condition. More than 300 were diagnosed to receive treatment.

Verizon is an active member of the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) , 
an industry association dedicated to promoting and sharing environmental and 
social best practices. 
Two of GeSI’s recent reports outline how technology can create 
shared success:

helping customers reduce carbon emissions
One of the most direct ways we 
make the world better is through our connected technologies.  
By using connected solutions to displace energy-intensive technologies, we help our customers save energy and 
reduce their carbon emissions. 
As part of our shared success strategy, we work with the Carbon T rust, a respected nonprofit, to measure the yearly 
reduction in CO
2e emissions 
our customers are achieving 
through the use of our products 
and services. Eliminating 5.9–8.6 million metric 
tons of GHG emissions is equivalent 
to removing 1.2–1.8 million cars  
from the road for one year.98–144% of Verizon’s 2015 operational 
emissions (Scope 1 and 2) were offset by CO

18EnvironmentTo minimize our impact, we set a goal in 2009 to reduce our carbon intensity — 
the carbon our business emits divided by the terabytes of data we transport over 
our networks —by 50 percent by 2020, even as we grew our business. 
We have exceeded this goal, reducing carbon intensity by 54 percent through the 
first quarter of 2016, nearly four years ahead of our target. 
We achieved this reduction through copper-to-fiber migrations, investments in 
green energy, building improvements and changes in our fleet operations. 
Our results are independently assured . We commissioned independent external assurance of our 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 (exclusively business travel) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon intensity 
for 2015 and reported the results through our 2016 CDP Climate Change Response (CDP.net) and on 
our corporate site. We are currently undergoing independent external assurance of our full-year 2016 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 (exclusively business travel) GHG emissions and carbon intensity. Later this year, we 
will report our 2016 results through our CDP Climate Change Response and on our website. For more

environmental regulations, and our environmental stewardship meets or exceeds legal requirements. 
In 2016, Verizon received 37 notices regarding compliance with state and local  
environmental regulations. Most of the notices were for record keeping or other  
minor issues. Verizon is taking steps to address these notices and prevent them  
from occurring in the future. Paper 
We are committed to the sustainable sourcing and use of paper, as detailed in our 
Paper Sourcing and Use policy .
* This excludes bills that cannot be printed on recycled-content paper due to machinery issues.90 percent 
of the paper Verizon sources is  
certified by the Forest Stewardship 
Council  as having been manufactured 
in an environmentally friendly, socially responsible and economically  
viable manner. 
Verizon saved approximately 
288 tons of  
paper, or about 5,700 trees,
by reducing the amount of paper  
we use for customer orders.51 percent 
of our sourced paper includes at 
least 10 percent postconsumer waste content.* 
Partnering with organizations like the Arbor Day Foundation, we sponsored the planting of more than 68,000 trees in 2016, exceeding our goal of 50,000. 
Our goal for 2017 is to sponsor the  
planting of 
60,000 trees.

21Environmente-Waste 
Verizon aims to reduce the number of cell phones,  
set-top boxes and other products that end up in landfills 
by reusing or recycling them. As part of this strategy, we 
remove, refurbish and redistribute Fios set-top boxes.
We also recycle Verizon-owned equipment, including 
network equipment, batteries and other supplies.
2016 Recycling Results
• 28.8 million pounds of Verizon materials 
recycled in 2016
• 112 million pounds recycled since 2014, surpassing our goal to recycle 90 million 
pounds by year-end 2016
• New goal to recycle 120 million pounds 
by 2020
• 308,771 pounds of e-waste collected at 50 recycling rallies in 2016
— 
enough to offset 444.7 metric tons of CO
2e emissions
• 2.5 million pounds of e-waste collected at recycling rallies between 2009 and 2016
• 46 percent reduction in the use of 
nonfunctional handset replicas for 
marketing purposes since 2015
— 
equivalent to eliminating approximately 
70 tons of plasticBatteries & telecom materials
Our practices for recycling batteries exceed regulatory 
mandates. Verizon sends materials from U.S. operations 
for recycling to approved facilities in the U.S. or Canada. 
These facilities are audited at least every five years. In addition, we require suppliers to send their used 
batteries to approved recycling facilities that meet 
Verizon’s Environmental, Health and Safety Standards. 
In 2016, we recycled more than 67 million pounds  
of batteries, paper, cardboard, telecommunications 
equipment and other items:

26The V TeamDiversity & inclusion
We pride ourselves on being a leader in diversity and inclusion.
Our global Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) provide members with a chance not only to celebrate 
their common ties but also to network, to find or act as mentors, to learn new skills and to give back to the community. Verizon sponsors nine ERGs:
• Asian-Pacific Employees for Excellence
• Consortium of Information and Telecommunications Executives (African-Americans)
• Disabilities Issues Awareness Leaders
• Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Employees of Verizon and Their Allies
• Hispanic Support Organization
• Native American People of Verizon
• South Asian Professionals Inspiring Corporate Excellence
• Veterans Advisory Board of Verizon
• Women’s Association of Verizon Employees
To expand our best practices for a diverse and inclusive culture, we launched workshops to address 
unconscious bias. They span our entire employee base, from our CEO and senior management team through all levels.
In 2016, our dedicated military-recruitment team —which represents each branch of service —hired 
1,046 veterans. We also engage and support military spouses with career guidance by connecting them to a military-spouse recruiter.
We’re proud to have more than 10,000 veterans serving our customers. Our military leave policy allows 
our service men and women to continue serving their country. When V Teamers are called up to active duty, we bridge the gap between military pay and Verizon pay to ensure their family members and financial needs are cared for.

We have a long history of providing good jobs 
and working with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers — the two main unions that  
represent about 36,400 of our employees  
nationwide.
We meet with national and local union leaders regularly to talk about key business 
topics, including safety, customer service, plans to improve operational processes, 
our business performance, and the impacts that changing technology and 
competition are having on our customers, our employees and the company.
At the start of 2016, the company and unions were in negotiations over 28 contracts 
that cover our union-represented employees who serve our customers throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast geographies. A work stoppage, lasting nearly seven 
weeks, concluded with agreements that were successfully ratified by the unions’ 
membership. Those agreements are in effect through August 2019.
In keeping with Verizon’s history of providing high-quality service and good jobs, the 
new agreements continue to provide our employees with competitive wages and valuable benefits that rate among the best in our industry.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are among the many risks that we

from concerns over sustainable operations to those related to privacy and the use of 
data in the information economy. 
The Audit Committee assesses Verizon’s significant business risks, including those  
related to data privacy and cybersecurity, and oversees Verizon’s compliance  
processes and programs.
Human rights
Our Human Rights Statement  articulates our respect for the broad principles 
outlined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our Supplier Code of Conduct  mandates that our business partners and suppliers 
conduct their operations in an ethically responsible manner and in compliance with 
applicable law.Stakeholder engagement 
Our long-standing Consumer Advisory Board (CAB), composed of leading business 
and public-interest advocates, provides us with an unfiltered view of relevant 
technology, consumer, business and social issues at twice-yearly meetings. CAB 
members’ perspectives and advice play a role in the development of many important Verizon policy and business decisions.
We strive to make it easy for our stakeholders to understand our positions and 
progress on issues that matter to them. As such, we publish:
A semiannual Transparency Report , listing all the law-enforcement 
requests for customer information that we received in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business as of the publication date;
A semiannual Political Contributions Report , disclosing all of Verizon’s 
PAC contributions, corporate political contributions and independent expenditures; and
An Open Internet policy , which outlines our commitment to an open 
internet that provides consumers with competitive broadband choices and internet access
