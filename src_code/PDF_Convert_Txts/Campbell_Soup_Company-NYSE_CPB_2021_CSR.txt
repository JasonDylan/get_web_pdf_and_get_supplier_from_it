In 1869, a fruit merchant had a simple idea: to make the most 
delicious food with the best ingredients affordable to all. Rooted 
in farm-grown ingredients, sourced responsibly and delivering the 
same delicious taste, every time. More than 150 years later, we’re 
still staying true to those ideals while striving to fulfill our 
purpose, Real food that matters for life’s moments . This report 
demonstrates the progress we made in fiscal year (FY) 2020 
across our Corporate Responsibility priorities, focusing on the 
family of brands that now make up Campbell Soup Company.ROOTED IN

LEAD US FORWARD
WE ARE DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF OUR 
PURPOSE  BY ADVANCING OUR COMMITMENT TO 
REAL FOOD, TRANSPARENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY, 
AND BY FOSTERING DEEP COMMUNITY 
CONNECTIONS WHERE WE HAVE OPERATIONS.
Mark Clouse
President and Chief Executive Officer, Campbell Soup Company
FY2020 brought with it extraordinary 
challenges as our country and company 
grappled with a global pandemic that 
fundamentally altered our society  
and economy.
Throughout the pandemic, consumers across North America 
have relied on Campbell for comfort and sustenance. In the first 
half of FY2020, we established a strong foundation for our 
business, which served as a springboard during the pandemic. 
Our brands were reintroduced to millions of households as a 
result of the unprecedented demand for food. This demand 
translated to historic business performance for Campbell in 
FY2020. We believe that many of the consumer behaviors 
developed during this time, such as “quick-scratch” cooking, will 
be lasting, and Campbell will continue to play an integral role in 
peoples’ lives, offering comfort, convenience, quality and value. 
Campbell’s purpose, anchored in making real food, has never 
been more relevant than it is right now.
Delivering on the promise of our purpose through real food, 
environmental and social remain key pillars of our strategic 
plan, even as we navigate this new environment.Real Food Comes From Real Heroes
To effectively respond to the pandemic, we simplified our 
mission by focusing on three clear priorities: 
1. Take care of our people;
2. Produce and distribute our products as safely and as 
quickly as possible for our customers, consumers and 
communities across North America; and 
3. Anticipate and plan for the future.
Our top priority is always the safety and well-being of our 
employees. From the outset of COVID-19, we put protective 
measures in place, including protocols to identify potential 
employee exposure, quarantines and contact tracing, and 
enhanced cleaning procedures. We also implemented daily 
health screenings with thermal imaging temperature checks, 
mandatory use of masks, vigilant social distancing and other 
policies to help employees who may be out of work due to 
caregiving or health-related needs.
The efforts of our employees, particularly our front-line teams and 
our supply chain, have been nothing short of heroic. Our entire 
organization rallied around the essential role we’ve been playing 
to ensure food is on tables across North America. In recognition  
of the extraordinary efforts of our front-line employees, we intro -
duced increased compensation through the end of FY2020 to 
more than 11,000 employees. The premium pay was in place for 
18 weeks, which was one of the longest-running programs in the 
food industry, and deservedly so, given the tremendous contribu -
tions of our front-line teams during this time.DEAR  CAMPBELL STAKEHOLDERS,
4From the outset of the pandemic, we recognized the immediate 
call for food and funding to help nonprofits meet the urgent needs 
of their communities. We quickly mobilized and in mid-March made 
an initial commitment of $1 million in funding and product donations 
to support food banks and local pantries in our 33 hometown 
communities. We have since increased that contribution to more 
than $8 million in financial support and food donations across 
our footprint in North America.
Going forward, the Campbell Soup Foundation will continue to 
focus on COVID-19 relief as communities navigate the social 
and economic impact of COVID-19.
Building a Winning Team and Culture
Building a winning team and culture is another core component 
of our strategic plan. We are focused on creating an inclusive and 
diverse company and elevating the Campbell Employee Experience 
– the key moments that are integral to working at Campbell.
COVID-19 was not the only challenge this past year. 2020 was 
also a year of reckoning around racial issues and social injustice. 
We believe that as a company, Campbell can help drive societal 
change, and that starts with our organization, which is why we 
are creating an atmosphere where people can be real, and feel 
safe, valued and supported to do their best work.
In July 2020, we introduced an actionable inclusion and 
diversity (I&D) strategy focused on standardizing key business 
processes and increasing learning opportunities; advocating for 
ally networks and communities; and acting with transparency 
and accountability. As part of this work, we have committed  
$1.5 million in financial support over three years to nonprofit 
organizations to raise awareness, advance education and fight 
racism and discrimination. Working alongside the leaders of our 
Black Resource Group (BRG), the Campbell Soup Foundation 
identified organizations that are making an impact in the Black community and made a $400,000 contribution to the Equal 
Justice Initiative and $100,000 to the Boris L. Henson Foundation. 
The Foundation also worked with all of our Employee Resource 
Groups (ERGs) to create social justice funds for each ERG, 
matching employee donations at 100% – above our typical  
50% match for charitable contributions.
In October 2020, Camille Pierce joined Campbell as our first 
Chief Culture Officer. In this newly created role, Camille leads 
Campbell’s enterprise-wide I&D strategy, working across the 
organization to build a winning team and culture, and aligning 
the company’s I&D goals with business outcomes. Camille 
brings with her years of experience from senior roles in I&D at 
Whirlpool Corporation and human resources and marketing at 
Procter & Gamble. She will be integral to our approach to I&D 
and in enhancing our culture in a systemic and sustainable way 
– by making I&D a company-wide priority, supported by an 
integrated plan with measurable goals over multiple years.
As part of this work, we have committed to building a more 
diverse supplier base, setting a goal to increase our spend with 
diverse suppliers by 25% over the next three years. In October,  
I was proud to stand with a coalition of executives from across 
our home state of New Jersey to announce a commitment to 
increase spending with small and diverse local suppliers.
Empowering Stronger, Healthier Communities
This year, we will complete the final year of Campbell’s 
Healthy Communities – our 10-year, $10 million initiative 
focused on improving the health of young people, especially 
in Camden, and other communities where Campbell has 
operations. Now, we are working on the next installment  
of that multiyear commitment – with the long-term goal of 
creating a school food environment in which all students  
have access to food that provides the nourishment they  
need to thrive and excel.
Building a Sustainable and Resilient Supply Chain
We will deliver on the promise of our purpose through our 
corporate responsibility and sustainability strategy. We made 
several environmental commitments over the course of the year, 
including in May 2020, when we rolled out new sustainability 
commitments to reduce packaging waste by increasing circularity 
– keeping materials in use and out of landfills. To achieve this, 
we have committed to transitioning 100% of our packaging to 
recyclable or industrially compostable materials and designs by 
2030. These goals, listed below, are designed to address all 
phases of the packaging life cycle, from sourcing to end-of-life, 
including recycling or composting.CEO MESSAGE
5In September 2020, we joined retailers and food industry peers 
in the “10x20x30” initiative with the goal of halving food loss 
and waste by 2030. The 10x20x30 initiative is dedicated to 
achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 
(SDG) Target 12.3, which calls for a 50% reduction in food loss 
and waste worldwide by 2030. As part of this commitment, we 
will continue to measure and publish our own food loss and 
waste inventories.
We also continued to advance our farmer engagement work  
in our tomato, wheat and potato supply chains. A year ahead  
of schedule, we reached our goal to improve fertilizer use on 
70,000 acres of wheat. Reaching this milestone boosts farmers’ 
profitability, benefits surrounding water quality and reduces the 
impact on the climate.
As we look ahead and build upon our years of progress in 
advancing corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives, 
we are taking a more holistic approach to environmental, social 
and governance opportunities. Our new approach will help us 
further bring our purpose to life for our consumers, customers, 
investors, the environment and the communities we call home.In closing, Campbell plays an integral role in the fabric of our 
society, from the real food we make for consumers to the respon -
sibility we have in serving our communities and protecting our 
environment. We will continue to accelerate our impact in the 
areas of real food, sustainability, societal change and community 
support, as we advance our growth agenda and create value for 
our stakeholders.
I’d like to thank the entire Campbell organization for rising to all 
of the challenges we faced in FY2020. 
Sincerely, 
Mark Clouse
President and Chief Executive Officer

CELEBRATING OVER
150 YEARS
In 2019, we proudly celebrated Campbell’s 150th 
anniversary. This anniversary is much more than  
a number for us. It’s a testament to Campbell’s 
heritage and to the iconic brands that Campbell  
employees – past and present – have created and 
continue to nurture and grow. Not many companies 
have endured such a test of time, particularly given 
today’s rapidly changing trends. Campbell has 
demonstrated staying power, being guided by a 
clear purpose and a strong corporate responsibility 
and sustainability strategy. Take a look at some key 
milestones along our journey.1876
1948 1914
1961 1980 s 20141897
1920 sOur original packaging –  
tin cans and glass jars – is 
inherently sustainable, meant to 
be reused over and over again. 
At this time, the company name 
is stamped into the glass so the 
jars can easily be sent back to 
Campbell to be sanitized and 
used again.
Campbell acquires V8 and with 
it, the Napoleon, Ohio, plant. 
With this plant, we can now 
procure vegetables from local 
farmers in Ohio and Michigan.  
Many vegetables going to the 
Napoleon plant continue to 
be sourced from those same 
regions today. Later, this plant 
becomes the first in the legacy 
Campbell family to have  
solar installed on site. Dr. John T. Dorrance becomes 
President of Campbell, and 
his approach to procurement 
becomes the company standard: 
don't buy anything you wouldn't 
put in front of your own family. 
This is where our Real Food 
Philosophy originates. 
Campbell acquires Pepperidge 
Farm, founded by Margaret 
Rudkin in 1937. Margaret 
Rudkin becomes the first 
woman to sit on Campbell’s 
Board of Directors the  
same year.Snyder's of Hanover consolidates its operations in Hanover, 
Pennsylvania, beside a wheat field owned by the brand's 
founder. The wheat from that field is used to make Snyder′s 
of Hanover  pretzels, and continues to supply us today.  
Later, the site builds a LEED Gold certified Research  
Center and a 26-acre solar field.Campbell declares its intention  
to be a purpose-driven  
company and launches our 
purpose, Real food that matters 
for life’s moments . The Real 
Food Philosophy, rooted in the 
values of Campbell’s founders, 
is launched in 2016.Dr. John T. Dorrance invents 
condensed soup. By con -
densing soup and letting 
consumers add the water at 
home, the cans are smaller 
and lighter, which in turn 
means using less steel  
and less fuel when  
shipping to customers.
Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, John Dorrance and 
his wife, Ethel, host annual meetings for farmers at 
their home on Campbell's research farm in New Jersey. 
Campbell's in-house agricultural experts discuss new 
growing techniques and methods, educating our farmers 
on crop rotation, water savings, seed selection and how 
to maximize yields.
7As a food company, we continually evolve our business to meet market conditions, best practices, and social 
and environmental demands. We take the same approach with our corporate responsibility (CR) strategy. After 
a series of key acquisitions and divestitures over the last few years, we took a step back and reevaluated our 
focus areas and targets against a renewed Campbell. We asked ourselves where we could have the greatest 
impact with our new family of brands and have evolved accordingly to reflect that new focus.
Transitioning to a More Holistic Strategy
To make an even greater impact, we are evolving our CR strategy 
to a more holistic approach with a focus on environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) opportunities. This approach will allow 
for increased engagement across the organization and help  
us to continue meeting the expectations of our consumers, 
customers, investors and other stakeholders.
We have identified 14 ESG focus areas that were determined by 
three key considerations:
•  Issues that are most material to Campbell
•  Issues that have historically been a strength for Campbell
•  Issues that the company and our brands can leverage to 
make a measurable impact into the futureIn FY2020, owners of each focus area were identified within 
the business to build out three-year strategic plans for their 
focus area. While we have been reporting on these focus areas 
for years, this new approach will enable Campbell to manage 
corporate responsibility in a more holistic and strategic way 
over the long term by building strategies for progress into the 
business itself with alignment from our senior leadership team.
While we continue to report our corporate responsibility work 
in the Grown, Sourced, Produced and Shared framework in this 
report, we will be co-creating and launching a new communications 
framework in FY2021 that reflects our new approach and builds 
an aspirational vision for Campbell. CORPORATE

In FY2020, we worked with The Sustainability Consortium (TSC) 
to complete a commodity risk assessment that represented  
our new family of brands. This assessment reviewed the 
environmental and social risks associated with 30 ingredient 
categories in our product portfolio. The results indicated that 
we needed to make the following changes to our priority raw 
materials list:
•  Removed beef, eggs, pork, soy and sweeteners because we 
source primarily from the U.S. and Canada, which is lower risk.
•  Removed jalapeños and seafood because we purchase small 
volumes of these categories, and 89% of our seafood is Marine 
Stewardship Council (MSC) certified.
•  Focused dairy on cheese ingredients, as they feature most 
prominently in our products.
•  Added almonds and cashews because of volumes purchased 
and shift in brand focus since purchasing the Pacific Foods , 
Emerald  and Lance  brands, along with the environmental and 
social risks associated with these ingredients.
For the ingredients removed from our priority list, we will 
continue to monitor our suppliers to ensure continued  
compliance with our Responsible Sourcing Supplier Code.
Celebrating Notable Wins
We also achieved some notable corporate responsibility wins. 
•  We launched four new sustainable packaging  
commitments focused on packaging recyclability,  
recycled content, consumer education and expanding  
access to recycling infrastructure. •  We enabled food access across the country during the 
COVID-19 pandemic by increasing production to help  
meet demand and giving over $8 million in cash and  
in-kind donations to community organizations in our  
33 Campbell hometowns. 
•  We prioritized the health and safety of our employees during the 
pandemic, especially our front-line workers with supplemental 
payments, temperature checks, personal protective equipment, 
social distancing practices and other accommodations.
•  We advanced our farmer engagement work in our tomato, 
wheat and potato supply chains, and reached our wheat 
fertilizer optimization goal one year ahead of schedule. 
•  We advanced traceability of priority raw materials along our 
supply chain.
As we build the next generation of our corporate responsibility 
strategy, we will continue to advance these efforts, and 
others, and report on our progress in our annual Corporate 
Responsibility Report.
Our strategy will also continue to be built with major food 
industry trends in mind. From water scarcity, climate change 
and animal welfare to affordability, nutrition and transparency, 
we are driving impact. And as we work together now to lay the 
foundation for Campbell’s next 150 years, we remain resolute in 
our belief that while the world continues to change around us, 
some things must remain constant: our commitment to real 
food and our commitment to transparency.
OUR VISION
We strive to build a more resilient food system, making 
real food that improves the world we all share, for 
generations to come.OUR MISSION
To deliver on the promise of our purpose through 
food that is ethically and sustainably grown, sourced, 
produced and shared.

9 1.  Due to the sale of the Bolthouse Farms business, carrots are no longer a priority ingredient for Campbell and have been removed from our list of 
priority raw materials. In FY2020, we reassessed raw material risks and made some changes to our list of priority raw materials based on our new 
family of brands. We removed beef, eggs, jalapeños, pork, soy, sweeteners and seafood; we focused the dairy category on cheese ingredients; and 
we added almonds and cashews to the list. 
2.  In FY2020, our progress decreased slightly for cage-free and gestation crate-free pork, compared to FY2019, because of higher demand for products 
during the COVID-19 pandemic that have not yet converted.
3.  We remain committed to broiler chicken welfare. Our 2024 commitment is focused on advancing improved environments, including litter and 
enrichments. This approach is pragmatic, achievable and, most importantly, in line with industry progress and the capabilities of our suppliers.10

 1.  In FY2020, our progress decreased slightly for cage-free and gestation crate-free pork, compared to FY2019, because of higher demand for products during the COVID-19 
pandemic that have not yet converted.
2.  Responsibly sourced means the supplier has:  
  • Acknowledged compliance to and signed Campbell’s Responsible Sourcing Code.  
  • Disclosed country of origin and has undergone a SMETA audit if the country of origin is high risk according to the World Bank and/or the supplier is deemed high risk.  
(High risk may be defined as supplier facing negative public attention, a third-party investigation and/or Campbell organizational focus.)13

1.  In FY2019, we generated renewable energy, and in prior years we sold it to others.
2.  Scope 2 GHG emissions data prior to FY2020 were calculated using the location-based method. FY2019 GHG emissions were third-party verified.  
FY2020 Scope 2 GHG emissions data within the table were calculated using market-based calculations and include the application of RECs. Location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions 
were 251,477 metric tonnes of CO2e. They were third-party verified, as well as our water and waste to landfill data for FY2020.
3.   In prior years, Scope 3 emissions included only employee business travel by car, plane and train. In FY2019, Campbell estimated additional emissions categories, including Purchased 
Goods and Services, Capital Goods, Fuel and Energy Related Activities, Waste Generated in Operations, Business Travel, Employee Commuting, Upstream Leased Assets, Downstream 
Transportation and Distribution, and End of Life Treatment of Sold Products. We have also corrected a unit error from kg to metric tons, removed divestitures and included acquisitions.
4.  In partnership with an external consultant, we have improved our Scope 3 calculation methodology to be more detailed and accurate, and have restated our FY2020 Scope 3 
emissions using this methodology.
5. The Plum Organics brand previously purchased carbon offsets to cover the GHG emissions associated with its office footprint. The brand did not purchase carbon offsets in FY2020.14

19MATERIALITY
Corporate responsibility topics are considered material for us if 
they influence the judgment and decisions of our external and 
internal stakeholders, as well as having an impact on them and 
our business. In FY2019, we conducted a robust assessment 
with internal and external stakeholders to understand where  
to focus as our company evolves and identified and prioritized 
our material corporate responsibility topics through a four-step 
assessment process.
Step 1: Identify Issues  – We reviewed the material corporate 
responsibility topics reported publicly by our peers and assessed 
issues that are trending in the media and with Campbell’s inves -
tors, customers, suppliers and NGO partners. From this research, 
we added a few new topics to our list, including Risk and Crisis 
Management, Product Innovation, Supply Chain Resilience and 
Commodity Availability, Pesticides and Chemical Contaminants, 
Women’s Empowerment and Responsible Use of Technology.
 
Step 2: Survey Stakeholders  – We surveyed internal and external 
stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, retail customers, 
NGOs, trade associations, etc. We also posted the survey on 
Twitter for consumer feedback, which we received. The survey 
asked stakeholders to rate the importance of 25 topics in four 
broad categories: Responsible Business Practices, Societal Impact and Labor Practices, Product Responsibility and Environmental 
Responsibility. Stakeholders were also asked, of the 17 United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals, where Campbell could 
have the most impact. The responses reaffirmed our previous 
alignment with Goals 2, 3, 8, 10, 12 and 13. We received nearly 
1,500 responses in total with employees accounting for  
88% of responses.
 
Step 3: Survey Leadership  – We surveyed Campbell leadership 
to understand how the 25 topics might impact the business over 
the next five years. Leaders from across the business were asked 
to rate our ability to control potential impacts, the likelihood of 
such impacts and how these might impact our reputation, 
strategic plan, purpose and/or values.
 
Step 4: Validate  – The results of the assessment were shared 
with leaders across the business who provide feedback on the 
topics. These results were validated against the results of the 
research along with the feedback of our Campbell leaders. The 
results are shared below and are reevaluated throughout the 
year, as topics can shift in priority. We did see significant shifts 
in the rating of select topics compared to our last assessment 
in FY2016, including the ranking of Transparency along with 
Health, Nutrition and Wellness, among others.

GROWNReal food has roots. Roots in farm-grown ingredients, delicious taste and 
sustainable agriculture. Real food has roots in quality and heritage. And our 
focus on integrating sustainability principles into how we grow our food and 
nurture our land continues in partnership with farmers across the country.
Campbell’s priority ingredients for sustainable agriculture are tomatoes, wheat, potatoes, 
almonds and cashews – ingredients important to our brands and our stakeholders. In fact, 
with the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance and the formation of the Campbell Snacks division,  
we are now one of the largest purchasers of chipping potatoes in America.
We recognize our impact can be significant. That’s why we have 
been working on projects that conserve natural resources, improve 
livelihoods on farms and connect farmers with the latest innova -
tions and data analytics. These efforts empower farmers to make 
better-informed decisions. They also help us be transparent with 
our customers and consumers on the progress we make and on 
challenges that are too complex to be solved with short-term 
solutions. After all, real food must also be rooted in respect for 
nature – and we continue to learn from nature about how to best 
nurture it while growing enough food sustainably and responsibly 
to feed an ever-growing world.
Partnerships are a core component of our approach. In 2019, we 
partnered with The Sustainability Consortium (TSC) to help launch  
a task force on Responsible Pest Management. We assisted in 
recruiting a broader set of members for the task force and helped 
inform its guidelines and objectives. The task force is up and running 
and currently working to collect and analyze available data on pest 
management. The goal: to develop metrics and tools that can be used 
by farmers and companies to measure and report on responsible pest 
management and identify opportunities to reduce risk on farms.OUR APPROACH

1.  In FY2020, 100% of potato supply was baselined, laying the foundation for engagement in a sustainable agriculture program in FY2021. 
2. Some annual fluctuation in irrigation adoption rates is expected due to factors such as crop rotations and increased furrow-irrigated organic tomato use.25In 2015, we set a goal to enroll 70,000 acres of wheat in a 
fertilizer optimization plan by 2020. In 2018, we expanded  
our commitment by setting a target to sustainably source  
50% of our wheat by 2025.
To accomplish these goals, we collaborated with Truterra, LLC 
(the sustainability solutions business of Land O’Lakes, Inc.) as 
they developed a data analytics tool called the Truterra™ Insights 
Engine. This data platform helps farmers advance their 
environmental stewardship acre-by-acre and see the financial 
return on their sustainability investments. It also creates a 
framework for continuous improvement while benchmarking 
against yield and profitability 
to ensure specific and 
scalable on-farm solutions 
that benefit both natural 
resources and the farmer.
Additionally, the Truterra 
partnership leverages the 
nationwide network of Land 
O’Lakes’ agricultural retailers. 
As trusted advisors to farmers, 
these retailers are ideally 
positioned to deploy the 
Truterra™ Insights Engine, 
deliver expert advice on each 
field and facilitate flows of 
information between farmers 
and other partners in the wheat 
value chain. In 2017, we 
launched the first phase of our 
wheat sustainability program  
in the Chesapeake Bay water -
shed area of Maryland and 
Pennsylvania. Here, Truterra began working with local agricultural retailer, The Mill, to advance 
stewardship efforts with farmers across 10,000 acres of wheat. 
In 2019, we began collaborating with Heritage Cooperative to 
launch a similar effort in Ohio, another important wheat sourcing 
region for Campbell. By the end of FY2020, Heritage had engaged 
60,000 acres of wheat in the Truterra program, bringing our 
partnership to an important milestone: the completion of our 
70,000-acre commitment, one year ahead of schedule.
Another key milestone in FY2020 was the release of results 
from year two of the program, enabling us to draw insights from 
year-on-year data for the Chesapeake Bay area. Among other 
things, we learned that participating acres were, on average, 
GHG emissions-neutral, and that nitrogen-use efficiency and 
soil erosion reduction improved between 2018 and 2019. Jason 
Weller, Vice President of Truterra, LLC, conveyed the significance 
of these results: “These data help to provide proof of concept 
for farmer-led, and ag retailer-supported, stewardship efforts.”
Powered by these data, we continue to make progress to 
enhance farm stewardship, productivity and resiliency. Truterra 
and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation have also formed 
a partnership that will integrate conservation agronomy 
specialists into the services at Heritage Cooperative in Ohio. In 
the Chesapeake Bay region, The Mills’ agronomists also 
collaborate with a local Pheasants Forever Biologist, a resource 
funded in the 2018 Farm Bill. The ultimate goal of these efforts: 
to equip wheat farmers with new best-in-class tools to help 
protect air, land and water – and the economic health of their 
farms – while supporting sustainability across the supply chain.GROWN // STORIES OF PROGRESS

WE REACHED OUR 70,000-ACRE 
FERTILIZER OPTIMIZATION GOAL  
ONE YEAR EARLY.26
The most notable strengths of our tomato supply chain relate to 
our partnership with our tomato farmers. Two key aspects are 
the proximity of the family-owned farms we work with – many 
within just five miles of our processing plants – and the close 
and long-term relationships we enjoy with our tomato farmers, 
some of them working with us since the 1940s. 
Working closely with these 
farmers and seed compa -
nies each year, we select 
tomato varieties that have 
higher initial “tomato solids” 
content (sugars, minerals, 
proteins, etc.). This helps to 
reduce the amount of en -
ergy required to evaporate 
the water out of them to 
create tomato paste. In the 
fields, farmers increasingly 
adopt drip irrigation, which 
helps save water, and regularly test soil samples to optimize 
fertilizer use. For years, we have worked with growers individu -
ally to embed sustainability into field management, while using 
data to inform best practices.Sustainability doesn’t just stop at the edge of the tomato field.  
It is also embedded throughout our plant operations. Over  
80% of the tomatoes that go into Campbell products come 
from our two tomato processing plants in California at Dixon 
and Stockton. Acquired in 1976, these two plants serve as an 
important step in our tomatoes’ journey as they ultimately make 
their way into over 60 million households across the United 
States every year. And there is not a single part of the tomato 
that is wasted in the process. The tomato ingredients are 
crafted via Campbell’s proprietary methods specifically for use 
in our high-quality product recipes.
The people at our plants have their own personal stories, rich 
with appreciation for Campbell, their work and the familial 
bonds they have established over decades. The average 
length of employment at our tomato plants is 20 years, but 
some workers have been working at the plants for over 40 
years. Three Dixon, California, plant employees – Rosalio, 
Eugenia and Sara – have been there since 1975, when the 
plant opened. Our operations manager started at the plant 
when he was 18 years old as a mechanic, and one of our top 
mechanics began his career years ago as a sorter on the line. 
And it goes on. These are the stories that make us proud –  
and help us live up to our Real Food Philosophy, one tomato  
at a time.WHEN IT COMES TO TOMATOES, WE’RE FAMIL Y

27In 2020, Campbell updated its ingredient risk and opportunity 
assessment, resulting in some changes to our priority  
ingredients list (see page 32 for more information on the risk 
mapping process). Results of the exercise confirmed tomatoes, 
wheat and potatoes as priority ingredients for sustainable 
agriculture, but soy and jalapeños were replaced with almonds 
and cashews. Below is a snapshot of how we continued to 
work toward our sustainable agriculture goals in FY2020:
Tomatoes
Because tomatoes are the largest ingredient category for our 
Meals & Beverages division, we continue to prioritize working 
with farmers to embed sustainability in agricultural practices.  
In FY2020, drip irrigation adoption declined slightly1 from 78% to 
75% of tomato acres, but water used to irrigate Campbell toma -
toes has been reduced by 23% per pound of tomato since 2012. 
GHG emissions from fertilizer use also dropped 26% in the same 
period, helping farmers become more resource efficient, while 
also increasing yields.
We also provide farmers with information and best practices  
on opportunities such as grant writing for farm sustainability 
projects, irrigation scheduling technologies and Integrated  
Pest Management (IPM). For example, Campbell is laying the 
groundwork to pilot the TSC Responsible Pesticide Management 
tool with select farmers (see page 8 for more information).  
We also continue to work closely with our communication 
teams to spotlight our family farmers and partners, such as  
a YouTube video partnership with Prego Farmers Market .
Wheat
In 2019, we launched a new Truterra partnership with Heritage 
Cooperative in Ohio which, along with our Pennsylvania/
Maryland partnership with The Mill, helped us meet our goal  
of enrolling 70,000 acres of wheat farmland into a fertilizer 
management program a year ahead of schedule. Building on  
this achievement, we plan to continue developing new relation -
ships to extend our acreage and deepen our impact on soil 
health, water conservation and IPM in the coming year. For 
example, with Truterra and partners we will launch a project  
to accelerate adoption of cover crops, a conservation practice 
that has co-benefits for all these purposes. 
Potatoes
In 2018, Campbell greatly increased its sourcing of potatoes 
with the acquisition of Kettle Brand, Cape Cod, Jays  and Tom’s  
chip brands. In 2020, we baselined how our farmers have been 
managing environmental and social issues to identify opportu -
nities for improvement. We were also energized by Kettle Brand’s 
longstanding commitment to sustainability and its tradition of 
transparently telling farmer stories. Building on that strong 
foundation, we joined the Potato Sustainability Alliance (PSA)  in 2020 to gain access to additional resources to further track 
and accelerate sustainability, including committing to utilize 
PSA tools to begin collecting and analyzing pesticide data 
starting in 2020.
Almonds and Cashews
Almonds and cashews are core ingredients for our Pacific Foods  
plant-based beverages, as well as our snacking nuts under the 
Lance  and Emerald  brands. They also add a delicious dimension 
to several Pepperidge  Farm  and Archway  cookie products. We 
source all our almond ingredients from California, the largest 
almond-supplying region in the world, where we have strong 
ties to the Almond Board of California and its sustainability 
program. In the year ahead, we will identify opportunities for 
Campbell to partner with our almond farmers and handlers to 
advance stewardship in this supply chain.
Campbell sources our cashew ingredients from West Africa and 
Asia, where many cashew farmers face challenges in optimizing 
yields and developing resilience to market and climate change 
risks. As with almonds, we will be investing time to understand 
priority areas and supplier capabilities in our cashew supply 
chain, in order to identify appropriate sustainability programs  
in FY2021.GROWN // STORIES OF PROGRESS

RELATIONSHIPS, INVESTING IN THE LONG TERM
A FARMER ONLY GETS 40 CHANCES
Prego Farmers Market  
partnered with YouTube 
channel True Food TV 
for “How Does it Grow ,” 
the story of processing 
tomatoes. The show 
features Campbell farmer 
Dustin Timothy and his 
now-retired father Ron –  
capturing the harvest through their eyes. Dustin is the fifth-  
generation operator of his family’s farm and is familiar with 
the many complications and complexities of bringing a crop 
to harvest. His father reflects, “As a farmer you only get 
maybe 40 to 45 chances, because you got 40 or 45 years 
in your career. You can’t make too many mistakes.” Building 
on Ron’s experience and technological advancements, Dustin 
employs a whole suite of tools to maintain his farm’s health, 
including crop rotation between tomatoes and sunflowers, 
and drip irrigation for water savings. In 2019, he was able  
to reduce water use by 30% per acre – as the next season 
approaches, the work continues.

In 2007, we established the Campbell Soup Company Fund  
for Research in Sustainable Agriculture in Vegetables at the 
University of California, Davis (UC Davis) College of Agricultural 
and Environmental Sciences, to support education and public 
outreach about sustainable agriculture and research. The 
endowment has helped fund over a decade of critical research 
in natural pest management, soil health, crop rotation, cover 
crops, nitrogen uptake, and water and drought management. 
The research has helped uncover new sustainable practices 
and opportunities for us, including work in 2011 on the reduction 
of GHG emissions through drip irrigation, which has been a 
cornerstone of our tomato sustainability program. In 2020, 
the fund supported four UC Davis students researching the 
viability of Kernza, a perennial wheat promoted for regenerative 
agriculture purposes, in California conditions.Campbell can’t produce a cracker, chip or can of soup without 
ingredients from farms. In the spring of 2020, because of 
COVID-19, our essential front-line teams in our production 
facilities had to adapt to a new way of working to provide food 
for our consumers. At the same time, our farmers also had to 
continue planting and harvesting the crops we need with 
added safety precautions.
One of our suppliers, Bullseye Farms in Woodland, California, has 
been providing tomatoes to Campbell for over 40 years. The farm 
altered its operations to enable social distancing by hanging 
plastic barriers between employees who sit next to each other 
on equipment used to plant tomato seedlings. Other employees 
were able to socially distance themselves while working outdoors 
and when interacting with staff in the farm office. All equipment 
was disinfected daily, along with break rooms, restrooms and the 
interior of work trucks. Employees were reminded regularly of 
the importance of reporting symptoms or exposures to the virus.
Jay Huddle Farms, a Campbell carrot supplier for 55 years  
in Napoleon, Ohio, has operations in Michigan as well, which 
brings some unique challenges because of the differences  
in state guidelines. The farm made sure that all employees 
received masks and that social distancing was practiced in 
office areas.And like our front-line teams, our farmers are proud of their 
contributions during the pandemic. “We feel it is important for 
us to keep working to help provide food for the nation,” says  
Eric Schreur, whose Schreur Farms have provided celery  
to Campbell for 12 years. “We take pride in what we do.”CAMPBELL’S FARMERS ACT TO PROTECT ESSENTIAL WORKERS

SOURCEDOne of the key principles of our Real Food Philosophy is that Transparency 
Builds Trust – and this holds true today more than ever. Our consumers  
expect us to do what’s right and be transparent with them – from the farm  
to their kitchen counter.
Whether that’s growing our food sustainably, sourcing our key ingredients responsibly or 
reducing our overall impact on the environment. In 2020, we took the opportunity to review 
our priority raw materials, making sure they reflected our full family of brands. We conducted 
a social and environmental risk assessment, which yielded several changes to our priority raw 
material list. With this sharpened focus, we took steps to drive environmental and social compli -
ance in our supply chain and advance our responsible sourcing goals. We continue to engage 
our suppliers and farmers to gain transparency into where our raw materials come from and 
how they’re grown.
In 2020, our plan was to launch our audit program, addressing our highest risk suppliers first, but 
the challenges of COVID-19 prevented us from conducting new audits. However, we’ve leveraged 
our Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) membership to review our suppliers’ previous audit 
performances to better understand how they conduct business, as we continue to hold them 
accountable to environmental, labor, health and safety, and business ethics standards.
Transparency, responsibility and sustainability are core to who we are and 
how we work at Campbell, and packaging sustainability is no different. We 
introduced our first set of packaging sustainability commitments in 2010. 
These were ambitious goals for the time, focusing on material reduction and 
the use of sustainable materials wherever possible. After nearly a decade 
of progress against those two initial goals, and after significant changes 
to our product and packaging portfolios, we decided that it was time to 
relaunch our packaging sustainability commitments. After almost a year of 
work benchmarking peers, gathering input from NGOs and investors, and 
meeting with our suppliers and our customers, we announced four new packaging sustainability 
goals in May 2020. These goals are focused on reducing the amount of packaging sent  
to landfills, increasing the use of post-consumer recycled materials in our packaging, and 
increasing recycling rates through education and infrastructure.OUR APPROACH

 1.  Responsibly sourced means the supplier has:  
• Acknowledged compliance to and signed Campbell’s Responsible Sourcing Code.  
•  Disclosed country of origin and has undergone a SMETA audit if the country of origin is high risk according to the World Bank and/or the supplier is deemed high risk.  
(High risk may be defined as supplier facing negative public attention, a third-party investigation and/or Campbell organizational focus.)
2. Country of origin means the country of the farm and/or plantation the raw material came from. 
3.  Our investigation into our beef, eggs, pork, soy and sweeteners supply chains showed that the majority of our supply comes from domestic sources, thus are low risk.  
We deprioritized our jalapeño and seafood categories because we purchase small volumes of each, and 89% of our seafood is Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified.  
We focused our dairy category to specifically address our cheese ingredients as they feature more prominently in our products. We added almonds and cashews because  
of their strategic importance to our acquired product portfolio and associated environmental and social risks.GOAL:

With our acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods,  
and divestiture of our international businesses, we wanted to 
ensure our priority raw materials accurately reflected the North 
American company we now are. Furthermore, with increased 
transparency into our supply chains from previous year’s efforts, 
we conducted a social and environmental risk assessment of 
our ingredient supply in partnership with The Sustainability 
Consortium (TSC). TSC is a nonprofit, multistakeholder group 
that works to improve the sustainability of everyday products. 
We assessed 30 ingredient categories across various environ -
mental and social indicators, using publicly available data sets 
from research institutions such as the World Bank, World Wildlife 
Fund and the University of Maryland. Based on the countries of 
origin, we determined the risk level of issues such as defor -
estation, child labor and biodiversity in our supply chains. With 
this information, in addition to volume and the understanding of 
the ingredients’ strategic importance, we refreshed our list of 
priority raw materials. New additions to the list include cashews 
and almonds, and we focused our dairy category specifically 
on cheese. Our investigation into these 30 ingredient catego -
ries confirmed that certain ingredients, such as soy, beef, eggs 
and sweeteners, are actually low risk, as we source primarily 
from the U.S. and Canada. Other supply chains, like seafood, 
already undergo strong due diligence because of the Marine 
Stewardship Council (MSC) certification process. While these 
categories are no longer priority raw materials, we will continue 
to monitor our suppliers to ensure continued compliance with REASSESSING OUR RESPONSIBLE SOURCING RISKSOURCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS
our Responsible Sourcing Supplier Code. This new list more 
accurately addresses the risks in our supply chain today and 
where the opportunities for positive impact exist into the future. 
A key element of driving responsible sourcing in our priority raw 
material supply chains is auditing. In 2019, we became mem -
bers of AIM-Progress and Sedex to enable transparency and 
streamline the audit process with plans to roll out our audit 
program in 2020. Because of COVID-19 and the restrictions on 
travel and challenges getting into our suppliers’ facilities, our 
audit program launch has slowed, and, as a result, we have 
been able to issue only four audit requests. We have leveraged 
both AIM and Sedex’s capabilities for mutual recognition, 
receiving social compliance audits of 12% of our supply. As  
we navigate the implications of the pandemic, we have been 
exploring the option of virtual assessments. 
3233ENSURING THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS 
Campbell uses animal-derived 
ingredients in products ranging from 
soup and broth to cookies and 
crackers. We remain dedicated to 
and continue to partner with our 
suppliers to advance the humane 
treatment of animals, including a 
commitment to transition exclusively 
to cage-free eggs in our supply chain 
by 2025. Currently, our Pepperidge 
Farm Farmhouse  cookies and Chunk 
cookies are baked only with cage-
free eggs. 
In addition, we recognize the importance of the humane treatment 
of broiler chickens. Campbell is committed to advancing the 
welfare of broiler chickens in partnership with our suppliers.  
We will work to source chicken meat from birds that have been 
raised in improved environments, including litter and enrichments 
by 2024. This approach is pragmatic, achievable and, most 
importantly, in line with industry progress and the capabilities  
of our suppliers.For our Pacific Foods products, we are committed to sourcing 
chicken certified at GAP 2 or higher by Global Animal Partnerships 
by 2023. We are currently at 75%.
In 2012, we committed to eliminating gestation crates from our 
pork supply chain and have been making steady progress. Over 
the past year, we learned that while pigs are spending less time 
in gestation crates, the crates were still used at certain times. We’ve 
worked with our suppliers and the University of Pennsylvania  
to better understand housing systems for pigs and their social 
behaviors. As a result, we are using the Ohio Livestock Care 
Standards to define our commitment. While we remain committed 
to ultimately eliminating the use of gestation crates and are 
partnering with suppliers to limit the amount of time spent by 
pigs in crates, there may be occasions when keeping pigs out 
of group housing may be beneficial for the well-being of all 
pigs by reducing unwanted aggression.
SOURCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS
34When we acquired the Snyder’s-Lance portfolio in 2019, we 
worked hard to map the brands that joined the Campbell family 
against our existing 100% certified RSPO palm oil commitment. 
We are excited to be integrating these brands into our commit -
ment and are on target to achieve 100% certification by the end 
of FY2021. Transparency and collaboration will remain key 
priorities for us as we continue to formalize our commitments 
and work across the areas of animal welfare, human rights, 
climate change and unsustainable resource consumption.Advocacy is a key pillar of Campbell’s Inclusion and Diversity 
strategy, and one of Campbell’s largest ally networks is our  
suppliers. We are committed to using our buying power to make 
the world and our communities a more equitable place and de -
velop a supply base that reflects the demographic diversity of 
our employees and our consumers. With this mission, we have 
a goal to increase our diverse spend by more than 25% over 
the next three years. We are focusing on building a pipeline of 
diverse suppliers and mentoring and preparing diverse sup -
pliers to do business with Campbell, ensuring that they have 
equal access to procurement opportunities.
One way we are building a pipeline of diverse suppliers is by 
focusing on our sourcing in our home state of New Jersey, 
where we have been headquartered for over 150 years. We 
have a strong presence in New Jersey, not only as an employer, 
but also as a buyer of goods and services. For example, we 
purchase vegetables directly from family farmers in South 
Jersey and contract with local businesses for our maintenance 
needs. In 2020, Campbell’s CEO Mark Clouse joined an 
informal coalition of nine CEOs from New Jersey-based 
companies, and in collaboration with Governor Phil Murphy, 
committed to increase their collective diverse supplier 
spending by $250 million by 2025.AN EXPANDED COMMITMENT TO SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
OUR RSPO JOURNEYSOURCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS
35In May 2020, we announced four new packaging sustainability goals to promote circularity and reduce the environmental impact 
of our packaging. The four goals address packaging design and material selection and its life cycle from sourcing to end of life. 
The holistic approach aims to reduce packaging waste through investments in recyclability, use of recycled content, and consumer 
education and infrastructure with the following four goals:OUR NEW SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING COMMITMENTSSOURCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS
Enabling Recyclability 
The most important part of our packaging sustainability mission 
is keeping our packaging and materials in use and out of landfills. 
To ensure this is possible we have committed to transitioning 
100% of our packaging to recyclable or industrially compostable 
materials and designs by 2030. This is an ambitious goal for  
us. Many of our packaging types and materials such as steel, 
aluminum and paper are already recyclable. However, those 
that are not, like the flexible bags used for many of our snacks 
packaging, will require new materials to enable recyclability  
or compostability. 
Increasing Use of Post-Consumer Content 
Increasing our use of post-consumer recycled content (PCR) in 
our packaging has two major benefits. Using PCR directly offsets 
our consumption of virgin materials and, as a result, reduces the 
environmental footprint of our packaging. Secondly, our use of 
PCR creates demand for recycled materials, thereby stimulating 
the market for PCR production and collection, sortation and 
processing of recycled materials. While many of our packaging 
materials such as steel, aluminum and glass have incorporated 
high levels of PCR for many years, our plastic packaging has not. 
That is why we have chosen to focus specifically on our PET 
bottles by committing to using 25% PCR by 2030. Incorporating 
PCR into these packages presents several technical challenges 
that must be overcome by our suppliers, in our design of the 
bottles, and by our manufacturing sites; however, our teams  
are optimistic that these can be overcome, and we are looking 
forward to making this improvement in reducing the environmental 
impact of our packaging.Transition 100%  of packaging 
to recyclable or industrially 
compostable designs and 
materials by 20301
Increase the use of post-
consumer recycled content

packaging by 20223
Expand access to recycling 
and advance the development 
of infrastructure to improve 
the collection and recycling 
of packaging by building and 
investing in partnerships with 
peers and industry groups4
36Using Standardized On-Pack Labeling 
Designing our packaging for recyclability can only get us so far, 
however. We also need to help our consumers understand what 
to do with our packaging at the end of its life. The How2Recycle 
labeling system, developed by the Sustainable Packaging 
Coalition (SPC), is a standardized way of making recycling easy 
and guess-free. Our Plum Organics  brand was an early adopter 
of the How2Recycle labeling system in 2017, and in 2019 we 
expanded the label to seven additional brands: Campbell’s, 
Prego, SpaghettiOs, Swanson, V8, Well Yes!  and Goldfish . 
In 2020, we further expanded the label to Milano, Pepperidge  
Farm  cakes and pastries, Pepperidge Farm  bread and cookies, 
Snyder’s of Hanover, Cape Cod, Kettle Brand, Jay’s  and Pop 
Secret . Now, we have made the commitment to implement 
How2Recycle labels on all of our brands across both our Meals 
& Beverages and Snacks divisions. This will require label 
redesign, resizing and/or other creative solutions, but we are 
excited to roll out the new labels and help our consumers 
better understand which packages are recyclable and how  
to recycle correctly.
Expanding Access to Recycling Infrastructure
In addition to shifting our packaging and consumer education, 
it is equally important for our consumers to have consistent and 
easy access to recycling in their homes and communities. To 
ensure we, and our entire industry, make progress in this area, 
we are committing to investing and engaging in partnerships with 
our peers and industry groups. We will continue our long-standing 
memberships in both the Association of Plastics Recyclers 
(APR) and the SPC. We are also excited to announce that in 
August 2020 we became a funding partner for The Recycling Partnership (TRP). We will also join TRP’s Polypropylene Recycling 
Coalition and the Flexibles and Films Coalition, two groups 
focused specifically on advancing recyclability for two of our 
more challenging packaging types.

continuing to produce enough food to feed everyone amid a changing climate.
In FY2020, we engaged key stakeholders across our organization to develop a comprehensive 
Environmental Sustainability Strategy that outlines where we need to continue to expand our  
efforts in energy, water and waste management practices and where we need to evolve our 
efforts to understand and manage impacts in our value chain. 
In FY2017, we set new environmental commitments 
to reflect who we were at that time. Looking forward, 
we are committed to working with the Science Based 
Targets Initiative to set a Science-Based Target for 
our value chain. We signed the Commitment Letter 
in October 2020 and have two years to set and 
approve the new commitments. This target will integrate our existing renewable commitment, 
update our existing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reduction goal and include Scope 3 
emissions reductions.  
In FY2020, we updated our Environmental Sustainability Policy 
and our Water Policy. Through these updates, we increased the 
scope and depth of our policies. We also completed a decarbon -
ization strategy which has helped us identify additional areas to 
reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. This includes expanding 
investment in renewable energy and onsite energy optimization, 
beyond our current renewable installations, which include five 
onsite solar installations and two onsite fuel cells. In FY2021, we 
will be conducting a more robust process to account for Scope 3 
emissions, along with a value chain water risk assessment to help 
us manage water risks into the future.OUR APPROACH

1.  Environmental progress across all of our key goals, including GHG emissions, water, waste to landfill and food waste, was impacted in FY2020 due to a few important factors: 
1) production increased drastically to meet the unprecedented demand for our products during the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) there were increases in overage and off spec 
product; 3) growing conditions led to more dirt and grit coming into our facilities that needed to be disposed of; and 4) We had significant power outages at one plant and 
inoperable recycling equipment at another plant.For Kettle Brand , sustainability comes first – and supporting 
renewable energy was a natural choice back in 2003 when 
600 solar panels were installed on the roof of the Salem, 
Oregon, plant – then the largest solar array of its kind in the 
Pacific Northwest. The panels generate 120,000 kWh per 
year, enough electricity to produce 272,000 bags of chips 
and avoid 85 tonnes of CO 2 emissions annually. 
Additionally, the Salem, Oregon, site offsets 100% of its 
electricity use by purchasing wind credits, eliminating  
14,850 tonnes of CO 2 emissions annually as a result.  
That’s equal to taking 3,153 cars off the road every year. 
We have conducted a comprehensive water risk assessment 
encompassing all of our plants. In partnership with a third-party 
firm, we looked at water from three risk categories:
• Local basin-level water risk 
• Assessment of future water risk 
• Financial or strategic water risk impacts on the business
The assessment included 
benchmarking against peers; 
evaluating facility-level water 
risk using a variety of screening-  
level tools; analyzing a 
preliminary set of most-at-
risk facilities with additional 
data, including value at risk; 
as well as on-site interviews 
to validate and refine model 
findings and document best practices. The process and 
results were then reviewed with internal stakeholders.Ultimately, after applying multiple risk models and conducting plant 
interviews, it was determined that none of Campbell’s facilities are 
currently at high risk for water quality and/or quantity impacts. The 
assessment found that our programs and management approach -
es were leading or near leading among our peers and sector 
leaders. It also highlighted an opportunity to better connect our 
stewardship with setting risk-informed goals and incorporating 
water as a material risk into our governance. We also completed 
third-party assurance of our water data for the second time 
and have committed to do this annually. In FY2021, we plan  
to complete a value chain water risk assessment and quantify 
water use upstream and downstream of our operations.ASSESSING OUR WATER STEWARDSHIP AND RISKS PRODUCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS

41KETTLE BRAND  CHIPS, POWERED BY NATURE42Making real food is the foundation of our purpose. Real food is 
prepared with care, and providing safe, high-quality food is a 
key part of the culture at Campbell and essential to maintaining 
trust with our customers and consumers. Managing COVID-19 
has been a key focus for the Quality team in 2020. In addition 
to ensuring product safety, the Quality team has worked closely 
with the Health & Safety team to create a risk mitigation plan 
that includes new processes, tracking and tracing protocols, 
elevated hygiene practices, countermeasure guidelines and 
reports that help to keep our employees safe and comply with 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards and Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance. 
To track exposure and mitigation activities, the team utilized 
their expertise to create a case management system. To ensure  
a safe work environment, our sanitation team developed 
enhanced cleaning protocols and collaborated with plant 
locations to ensure continuous supplies of cleaning materials. 
As global supply chains became stretched, our Quality teams 
utilized technology and other innovative solutions to ensure 
that the development of new products and production of 
current products was not interrupted. 
Even with the pandemic, we continued to improve the consumer 
experience by improving our practices and products. In FY2020, 
consumer complaints were reduced by 5.5% compared to FY2019, 
driven by the tireless cross-functional focus on continuous 
improvement, food safety, consumer satisfaction and supplier 
improvement. Constantly raising the bar by investing in training 
and certification, we held a 2.5-day Food Safety and Supplier 
Auditor training session developed between NSF and Campbell’s 
Quality team. The training was designed to keep our team’s 
audit skills sharp, consistent and focused to ensure the food 
safety and quality goals of the business are always achieved.
Our Quality and Food Safety team encompasses many disciplines, 
including sanitation, process safety, microbiology, toxicology and 
chemistry. These subject matter experts are constantly working to improve our programs. They collaborate with vendors, regulatory 
agencies, industry colleagues and academia to ensure Campbell 
is abreast of the latest techniques, equipment and research 
related to ensuring the manufacture of safe food. Significant 
work was also completed to ensure compliance with interna -
tional regulations to support our export business. And in 
FY2020, all internal manufacturing sites were Global Food 
Safety Initiative (GFSI) certified.  
The Quality and Food Safety team continues to exemplify 
Campbell’s Do Right and Be Real value by working around the 
clock to guarantee a safe work environment for employees and 
safe food for our consumers.
STRENGTHENING FOOD SAFETY  
THROUGH SUPPL Y CHAIN ENGAGEMENTPRODUCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS
Small improvements can add up if done right. For our Napoleon, 
Ohio, plant, which makes Campbell’s  soups, V8 beverages and 
Prego  sauces, several small initiatives identified by the team led 
to a 13% reduction in water use in FY2019, compared to a 
baseline of FY2017. The annual savings: $158,000. The team’s 
efforts included:
• Identifying and systematically optimizing all water lines 
going to the cookers• Closing an automatic valve in the chiller room, which was 
not sealed properly and was allowing water to pass through 
• Using tracers to identify problems, allowing for quicker and 
better identification of leaks and other issues  
A combination of system improvements, behavior change and 
engaged employees play a key role in achieving these savings 
at Napoleon and other plants.ENGAGED EMPLOYEES  
DRIVE WATER SAVINGS IN NAPOLEON, OHIO 43Maxton, North Carolina and Napoleon, Ohio
Our Maxton plant team focused on reducing their energy use by innovating on how 
they could use waste heat produced during food processing instead of expelling it 
into the air through cooling towers. The team introduced a heat recovery process 
to capture the heat and return it to the boiler house for reuse. The heat is now 
captured at the front end and used in the plant’s hot water system, resulting in 
annual savings of $350,000. We also cut our lighting electricity use in half by 
converting both the Maxton, North Carolina, and Napoleon, Ohio, plants to LED 
lighting. This update will reduce GHG emissions by 7,500 tonnes and save us 
$950,000 annually.
Charlotte, North Carolina
Innovation can come in the smallest of ways – and when the energy management 
program is owned and led by employees, it can have tremendous results. For instance, an employee  
in our Lance  crackers facility in Charlotte noticed that uncovered belts were running, even when the  
cracker product wasn’t. The problem was quickly fixed, extending the life of the belts and reducing the 
costs and energy needed to run the belts. Similarly, upgrading the combustion fan on one of our saltine 
cracker ovens led to unexpected savings. An old combustion fan was requiring the team to run heavier 
crackers to prevent breakage. The new combustion fan allows better control of heat during the baking 
process and helps prevent breakage, thereby allowing for a lighter-weight cracker. The result: a reduction  
in the amount of dough needed to make the crackers, a lighter cracker and $250,000 in annual savings.
Stockton, California
We continued to focus on water efficiency at our tomato processing plant in Stockton, California. The tomatoes 
processed here are used to make V8 beverages, Campbell’s  soups, Pace  salsas, and Prego  sauces. In 
FY2019, we accomplished significant water savings, reducing consumption by 29% through several innovative 
methods, including:
• Recycling the water evaporated out of the tomatoes when we make paste to offset freshwater  
use in cleaning various equipment in the plant;
• Using recirculated water instead of fresh water, to move tomatoes throughout the plant; and
• Raising general awareness and daily feedback to and from employees on how to limit wasteful  
uses of water.
 
Pepperidge Farm Bakeries
We completed converting all remaining heating and cooling systems across our Pepperidge Farm facilities 
from R22 to natural refrigerants ahead of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2020 deadline. R22 
has been declared an ozone-depleting substance in the Montreal Protocol, and the switch to ammonia and 
CO 2, which are natural refrigerants, will result in reduced energy consumption and GHG emissions.SMART INNOVATIONS LEAD TO SAVINGS  
ACROSS CAMPBELL FACILITIES1
The Charlotte, North Carolina, plant 
completed an LED retrofit in 2019, 
converting 150 T8 light fixtures and 
98% of its parking lot lights to LEDs.

TACKLING FOOD WASTE IN OUR OPERATIONS
The United States generates roughly 60 million tons of food waste annually, and nearly 40 million tons of that goes to landfill. About 
25% to 40% of the food that is grown, processed and transported in the United States will never be consumed, making eliminating 
food waste a core priority for us. Here's how we're doing it:OUR GOAL:
TO REDUCE WASTE TO LANDFILL BY  
25%  BY 2025 AND REDUCE FOOD WASTE BY 
50%  BY 2030, IN LINE WITH UNITED NATIONS 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 12.3.
SOURCE REDUCTION  
AND REUSE:  At our  
Lakeland, Florida, bakery, 
bread that would otherwise 
go to waste is sold to 
another company to make 
breadcrumbs.
COMPOSTING:  At our headquarters in Camden, New 
Jersey, we send food waste from our cafeteria to compost, 
and at our Stockton, California, plant, a third-party composts 
vines and damaged fruit from tomato processing.FEED ANIMALS:  Many of our plants send 
food byproducts that would otherwise go  
to waste to feed animals. This is the largest 
category of food waste diversion for our 
company. Potato waste from our Salem, 
Oregon, chip plant for instance, goes to a 
local dairy to feed their cows. And pomace 
from the fresh vegetables that we process  
at our Napoleon, Ohio, plant to make V8 
beverages is made into pet food.FEED HUNGRY PEOPLE:   
In FY2020, Campbell donated 
product in the amount of  
$49.3 million to support the 
local communities where  
we operate.
LANDFILL:  The remaining portion of food waste is sent 
to incineration or landfill. We have a goal to reduce waste 
to landfill by 25% by 2025 and aim to reduce food waste by 
50% by 2030, in line with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal 12.3.ANAEROBIC DIGESTION AND WASTE OILS:  
At our Napoleon, Ohio, plant, where we make 
soups, sauces and beverages, we send 
product that does not meet quality stan -
dards or is expired to anaerobic digestion. 
The packaging is removed and recycled, 
while the food waste is used to create 
energy. At our chip plant in Salem, Oregon, 
waste food oil is recycled into biofuels.Least PreferredMost PreferredThis photograph was taken before the COVID-19 pandemic.45
SHARED
EMPLOYEES46At Campbell, our purpose extends to how we maintain a culture of transparency, 
integrity, innovation and care. Our people are our most important resources and 
join the Campbell team because they see their values reciprocated and respected. 
Our rich legacy is a keen attraction for talent and one that we take immense pride 
in celebrating and encouraging.
As we’ve welcomed new brands into our family over 
the last few years, we’ve also spent time reevaluating 
our approach to the employee experience, which 
includes inclusion and diversity (I&D), learning  
and development. In December 2019, we launched 
Campbell’s first Employee Experience survey to 
understand how we could create a workplace where 
every employee feels valued, inspired and supported, 
and is fully engaged in their work. The feedback we 
received from this survey encouraged the launch of  
a new Employee Experience framework committed  
to building a winning team and culture at Campbell.
Our Employee Experience framework is underpinned 
by nine “Moments That Matter” during an employee’s 
career at Campbell. Under each of the nine Moments 
we have assembled teams who have committed to 
delivering initiatives identified through our various 
employee listening channels, including our now annual 
Employee Experience survey, as well as our pulse 
surveys, focus groups and interactive Workplace  
by Facebook channel.
With the onset of COVID-19, we chose to prioritize a  
few of the most critical Moments That Matter for our 
employees, accelerating work in these areas, to include:
•  My Way of Working:  To continuously improve 
performance management, as well as efficiency in decision-making and meeting effectiveness.
•  My Workspace:  To focus on enhanced safety protocols at our manufacturing facilities and ensure 
the well-being of our front-line employees; to expand new safety protocols in our office spaces in 
preparation for future re-entry; and to support our remote employees with technology for effective 
remote collaboration.
•  My Connections:  To improve the culture and connectivity of employees at Campbell so everyone 
can be real, and feel safe, valued and supported to do their best work. 
We also continued to progress our learning and development opportunities through a cohort-based 
program, manage  to WIN (taken by 80 people managers in FY2020) and two I&D self-paced  
courses (completed by 100% of people managers in FY2020), as well as the relaunch of Campbell 
University (10,524 e-learning courses taken in FY2020 through this platform by 3,316 unique  
learners) to equip employees with the tools they need to thrive.OUR APPROACH

term goal of 0 incidentsImage was taken prior to COVID-1948As part of our commitment to building a winning team and culture, we have launched an Employee Experience framework, 
underpinned by nine “Moments That Matter.” During COVID-19, we prioritized the following three “Moments”:BUILDING A WINNING TEAM AND CULTURE
Perform to WIN  uses an objective 
and key result (OKR) model through 
which employees set clear objectives 
aligned to our companies’ strategic 
priorities for the year. It’s designed to 
drive greater focus and alignment, 
improve our operating discipline and 
increase accountability. 
Meeting Effectiveness through the  
“5 Essentials” supports delivery of  
our enterprise priorities through more 
efficient and productive meetings. The 
5 Essentials set the expectation that 
all employee meetings must have an 
agenda, clear roles for meeting partic -
ipants, adequate preparation through 
pre-reads, strict time limits of either 
25-minute or 50-minute meetings, 
and strong re-caps with next steps 
and actions. Our team measures 
progress against these 5 Essentials, 
and our leaders hold their teams 
accountable for them.Keeping our front-line employees safe 
when they show up for work each day 
has been our number one priority 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Some of the safety protocols put  
in place include new temperature 
screening processes, enforced social 
distancing and barriers on our 
production lines, where these 
precautions can be challenging to 
implement, and protocols around 
personal protection equipment (PPE).
For our remote workers, Microsoft 
Teams was launched to help facilitate 
collaboration in our new COVID-19 
environment. Teams offers employees 
functionality that includes file sharing, 
enhanced chat and an improved virtual 
meeting experience, including more 
reliable audio and video quality. 
To-date, our team has achieved over 
95% adoption of the new technology.We have elevated our Inclusion & 
Diversity (I&D) strategy to strengthen 
connections for all employees,  
and ultimately improve the culture  
of our company through three 
strategic pillars:
•  Building I&D capabilities with 
systemic actions to drive change, 
including hiring a Chief Culture  
Officer as a member of the  
executive team
•  Creating advocacy for ally networks 
and communities, including our 
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)
•  Being accountable and transparent 
about our I&D progress, including 
a demographic dashboard and 
360 feedback/review program
We will also take time to ensure 
our purpose is fully aligned to our 
current strategy and our values truly 
reflect our company.My Way Of Working My Workspace My Connections
SHARED: EMPLOYEES // GOALS & PROGRESS HIGHLIGHTS 
Photograph was taken prior to mandating face masks in all Campbell plants.49Keeping our people safe when they show up for work each day 
has always been our number one priority. Never has this been 
more important than during the COVID-19 pandemic, as we work 
to ensure the continued health and safety of our employees 
from ever-evolving challenges. Our incredible team of dedicated 
safety professionals have worked day and night – and often 
behind the scenes – to help make this possible.
Our site safety leads have shown tremendous leadership, 
dedication and hard work during these turbulent times. At the 
onset of the pandemic, our safety team quickly went into action, 
developing health screening and social distancing procedures 
based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) and industry experts. 
To protect our front-line employees, we implemented the 
following practices and procedures:
•  Mandatory health screenings, including the use of thermal 
imaging scanners for temperature checks before each shift
•  The mandatory use of masks at all facilities
•  Implementation of aggressive social distancing best practices
•  Protocols to identify potential exposure and quarantine 
requirements based on and exceeding the CDC’s guidance
•  Enhanced cleaning procedures in place – with cleanings 
happening multiple times per day
•  Installation of physical barriers on our production lines
Campbell established a leadership team early on to facilitate the 
case management of COVID-19 illness cases, providing direction 
for personnel who contracted or were in close contact with a 
person who tested positive for COVID-19. When an employee tests 
positive for the virus, contact tracing is conducted immediately 
to identify other personnel who were within close contact, and 
a decision is made on whether the operation needs to be paused 
for further deep cleaning. This investigative work has been 
rigorous and time-consuming but is necessary to protect the 
safety of our employees. The speed at which we implemented EMPLOYEE SAFETY  IS TOP PRIORITY DURING PANDEMICSHARED: EMPLOYEES // STORIES OF PROGRESS
A social distancing mural created outside the locker rooms at our  
Maxton, North Carolina, facility.these management systems early on has helped to prevent the 
spread of the virus among our essential front-line team. 
In addition to managing the impacts of COVID-19, our safety team 
continued to identify and address opportunities to improve our 
processes and shift behaviors where needed. We implemented 
a new learning management system in FY2020 to ensure that 
our standard safety protocols are kept top of mind. Site safety 
leads can schedule and facilitate engaging safety training 
programs for all employees utilizing an online platform. The 
system helps to educate employees about Campbell’s Critical 
Safety Rules and our Behavior Based Safety program to help 
facilitate a healthy discussion around potential or future risks and 
hazards, and collaborate on solutions to prevent workplace 
incidents from occurring. 
While these are just a few examples of our exceptional teams 
collaborating during the COVID-19 crisis, we want to thank all of 
our employees who are managing a substantial workload while 
continuing to find more ways to help keep our people safe while 
feeding our nation.50
Inclusion and diversity(I&D) are crucial to building a winning 
culture that is committed to listening to, learning from and 
understanding one another in every interaction. This year, we 
deepened our commitment to I&D efforts, engaging with a 
strategic culture change consulting firm, The Kaleel Jamison 
Consulting Group, in December 2019. This group assessed our 
current culture through stakeholder interviews and presented 
multiple key findings, which served as a strong input to our 
enterprise I&D strategy, which consists of three pillars:  
Capabilities, Advocacy and Accountability.MAKING DIVERSITY  
PART OF HOW WE OPERATE SHARED: EMPLOYEES // STORIES OF PROGRESS
EMPLOYEE RESOURCE GROUPS
 
Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) continue to 
provide a way for employees to connect, develop and 
discuss important issues — and they’ve been active for  
over 10 years. We have 10 ERGs at Campbell:
• Asian Network of Campbell (ANC)
• Black Resource Group (BRG)
• BRIDGE Network
• Campbell Administrative Professionals (CAPs)
• Latino Network
• Maxton Employee Resource Group (MERG)
• Our Pride Employee Network (OPEN)
• Roots
• Veterans Connection
• Women of Campbell (WoC)
Our ERGs collectively host 7-10 events each month, 
focusing their efforts on developing talent, building  
culture within our organization, and connecting  
externally to our marketplace.
WE HAVE RELAUNCHED OUR 
DIVERSE SUPPLIER PROGRAM WITH 
THE GOAL TO INCREASE DIVERSE 
SUPPLIER SPEND BY 25% OVER  
THE NEXT THREE YEARS.Capabilities
Under our Capabilities pillar, we have launched multiple education 
forums to increase understanding and implementation of key 
concepts, mindsets, behaviors and skills that will build a more 
inclusive culture that leverages its diversity. In addition to the 
cohorts, we are working to document and standardize key 
business and HR processes to drive clarity and transparency for 
employees. Lastly, we have hired a Chief Culture Officer, Camille 
Pierce, who sits on the senior leadership team and will work to 
strengthen the culture at Campbell.
Advocacy
The Advocacy pillar works to strengthen ally networks and 
communities internally and externally. The Inclusion and Diversity 
Advisory Board, which launched in 2019, with the mission to 
advise our Campbell Leadership Team and serve as the voice 
of our employees, will continue to play a role in providing input 
on the impact and progress of our I&D efforts. We have also 
relaunched our diverse supplier program with the goal to increase 
diverse supplier spend by 25% over the next three years. Our 
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) have also been optimized 
and resourced to better support the organization. Among other 
engagement activities, many of our ERGs have focused 2020 on 
talent development and building internal community. Our Women 
of Campbell ERG hosted the first annual International Women’s 
Day celebration, which included a virtual learning opportunity and 
a webcasted fireside chat between Sarah Hofstetter, Campbell 
board member, and Elizabeth Duggan, Senior Vice President of 
the Transformation Office. The Latino Network celebrated Latino 
Heritage Month with an array of events, ranging from a Leader -
ship Panel to a virtual Salsa and Bachata dance class.
In support of our imperative to build diverse talent pipelines, our 
Black Resource Group, Latino Network and Women of Campbell 
ERGs launched sponsorship and/or mentorship programs to boost talent development. These programs include tailored trainings and 
activities that aim to cultivate deeper professional relationships 
and advance the careers of their members. 
In support of our external communities, Campbell pledged  
$1.5 million in donations to nonprofit organizations that are 
working to raise awareness, advance education and equity, 
promote social justice, and fight racism and discrimination. 
Employees can also donate in support of social justice through 
curated social justice funds created by most of our ERGs. At 
specific times of the year, employee donations to the funds will 
be matched at 100% by the Campbell Soup Foundation. 
Lastly, our Veterans Connection ERG partnered with Campbell’s 
Chunky  brand and the U.S. Army to host a discussion highlighting 
the unique impact veterans make on the corporate community. 
Subsequently, the ERG group recruited volunteers to connect 
with American Corporate Partners (ACP), a nonprofit group that 
provides mentors to veterans to help them transition back to 
civilian careers.  
Accountability
Our last pillar, Accountability, focuses on driving shared ownership 
and transparency of our I&D goals. We’ve committed to providing 
a demographic data dashboard that showcases the composition 
of our organization. We’ll also take our strategy and generate  
a scorecard that measures progress. To instill accountability 
throughout the organization, we’re launching a 360-degree 
feedback program for our managers, and all salaried employ -
ees have a performance objective that relates directly to I&D. 
Lastly, we’re updating the language in our Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics to better reflect the inclusive organization 
we strive to be. At Campbell, we will build a company where 
everyone can be real, and feel safe, valued and supported to 
do their best work.SHARED: EMPLOYEES // STORIES OF PROGRESS

CONSUMERS53From our humble beginnings canning whole, fresh tomatoes for use throughout 
the winter, to the multitude of products we make today, Campbell has spent the 
last 150 years providing multiple generations of American families with hearty and 
healthy food options. Our purpose – Real food that matters for life’s moments  – 
holds true despite the many changes we’ve seen across diets, lifestyles and 
expectations from consumers over those years.
Our Real Food Philosophy, which emphasizes 
transparency, consumer sentiments and 
expectations, as well as food prepared 
sustainably and with care, guides our work to 
develop new products and innovate existing 
ones. This Philosophy ensures we are giving 
people real food that they can enjoy, trust and 
afford, and that meet their health and well-being 
goals. As consumers continue to show more 
interest in plant-based options, accessible 
wellness, more natural ingredients and clean 
labels, we work hard to keep our research and 
development efforts in line with our Philosophy 
and these changing consumer demands.
We know that balancing consumers’ taste expectations with their health and well-being goals is 
crucial to our long-term success. We continue to evolve our nutrition strategy and improve our 
portfolio through product renovation and innovation. We are committed to offering a balanced 
portfolio that provides portion control options, makes it easier to eat underconsumed food 
groups, like vegetables and plant-based protein, and encourages families to eat together more 
often with quick-scratch cooking solutions. As we renovate existing products and launch new 
ones, we look for opportunities to decrease sodium and added sugar, while delivering the same 
great taste our consumers know and love.
We know that transparency is important to our consumers and other stakeholders. We provide 
nutrition and product information on packaging globally and dive deeper into sensitive issues 
like sodium , genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and more online, so that consumers can 
make informed choices about the foods they eat. We also publish clear marketing policies on 
our advertising practices to children . We rely on both internal subject matter experts and rela -
tionships with external experts and organizations to advise us on these nutrition, transparency 
and public health matters. 
As tastes and diets continue to evolve, we will continue to keep our eyes set on what our consumers 
want and what we believe is the right way forward for accessible and nutritious food. Just as we led 
the food industry in our commitment to voluntarily label GMOs in our food, we remain committed 
to stakeholder transparency into the future so that our consumers can make the best decisions 
for themselves and their families.FRUITS & VEGGIES –

SHARED: CONSUMERS // STORIES OF PROGRESS57Campbell is a proud partner of the Whole Grains Council, which 
is committed to increasing consumption of whole grains for better 
health. The Council does this through consumer education 
resources, media engagement and their Whole Grain Stamp 
program. To receive a stamp, each product goes through third-  
party validation from the Whole Grains Council to confirm that 
each serving of the product is at least 50% whole grain.
Over 75 of our products currently carry this stamp, including our 
Late July  chips, Pepperidge Farm  Whole Grain breads, Lance  
sandwich crackers and more. In FY2020, we delivered over  
1.5 billion servings1 of whole grains through Pepperidge Farm  
and Campbell brands. At the same time, we also offer products 
that meet the needs of people adhering to a gluten-free diet.  
Our Kettle Brand  chips and Emerald  nuts are 100%-certified 
gluten-free, and brands like Snyder’s of Hanover  and Late July  
provide gluten-free versions of their products. For several 
years, Snyder’s of Hanover  and Lance  have made donations  to support the Celiac Disease 
Foundation’s mission. Our 
Meals & Beverages portfolio 
also provides gluten-free 
options for select products 
from Pace, Prego, Swanson  
and V8. In FY2020 alone, 
we sold over $2.5 billion in 
gluten-free snacks, beverages, 
broths and sauces.
1.  This data does not include our newly-acquired 
Snyder’s-Lance brands. As a result, the number  
of servings of whole grains is underreported here. 
We are working to integrate our acquisitions into 
our data tracking systems to improve our data 
accuracy in the future.GRAIN OPTIONS THAT FIT CONSUMERS’ NEEDS 
In order to share real food signals and insights across the 
business, we created the Real Food Signal Tracking team, a 
cross-functional team dedicated to continuously monitoring 
external trends and signals that can impact how we design, 
make and procure ingredients and packaging for our food. This 
team has developed a systematic process to identify emerging 
issues, assess opportunities and identify ways to mitigate risk. 
The team has successfully brought together colleagues from 
R&D, Nutrition, Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability, 
Procurement, Legal, Regulatory, Consumer Insights, Food 
Safety & Quality, Packaging, Culinary and Sales.We believe in telling our consumers what is in our products so 
they can make informed choices about the foods they enjoy. This 
is why we are committed to transparency – providing information 
about our products on packaging and online to help consumers 
make food choices that meet their needs and the needs of their 
family. And we ensure that 100% of our products provide nutrition 
information on packaging globally.
Our multidisciplinary team of experts follows a rigorous multistep 
review process to ensure any claims we make for our products 
are truthful and not misleading to consumers. In addition to an 
extensive internal review process, regulatory agencies enforce 
compliance in our operating markets. At a minimum, we label for energy (calories), total fat, saturated fat, sodium, carbohydrates 
and protein in 100% of our markets. Most products also include 
a percentage of recommended daily intakes for nutrients per 
serving in line with local regulations.
We participate in front-of-pack labeling systems mandated by 
regulations throughout Central and South America markets.  
We also participate in voluntary front-of-pack labeling programs 
throughout other regions as determined by individual businesses. 
For consumers who want more information about our food, 
beyond what we can fit on product packaging, additional 
information about ingredients, nutrition and claims is available 
online on individual brand websites.

COMMUNITIES59Supporting and engaging with our communities is core to who we are at Campbell. 
It has been a part of our DNA from the beginning – starting with our founders –  
and has continued to drive our philanthropy today. For more than 150 years, this 
legacy of giving has remained one of the critical ways in which we deliver on the 
promise of our purpose.
Our Giving That Matters community affairs programming is built around our mission to strengthen 
and empower healthy communities in our hometowns and enhance employees’ connections to 
both the company’s and their personal purpose. Through our direct grantmaking, including the 
Campbell Soup Foundation and signature Campbell’s Healthy Communities program, employee 
engagement initiatives, in-kind giving, disaster relief and more, we work to achieve this mission 
by focusing our philanthropy on three focus areas:
• Increasing healthy food access
• Encouraging healthy living
• Nurturing Campbell neighborhoods
We work to increase healthy food access by concentrating on driving 
long-term solutions and changes to food systems that result in 
equitable access to fresh, healthy foods. To support healthy living 
and a healthy lifestyle, we encourage and provide access to nutrition 
education and active lifestyle programs. Finally, nurturing Campbell 
neighborhoods, by transforming the physical spaces where people 
live, learn and play, is a necessary foundation for building healthy 
communities wherever we are.
We believe that in order to build solutions to meet our communities’ 
most pressing social needs, we must engage in initiatives that are 
informed and championed by local residents to ensure their sustain -
ability. This, coupled with the passion and skills of our employees, our 
expertise as a food company and learnings from our signature Campbell’s Healthy Communities 
program, is helping inform what’s next for Campbell and our philanthropy.
In an unprecedented year, 2020 has put this approach to the test, challenging Campbell, our 
employees and our nonprofit partners to think differently about how we serve our local commu -
nities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether it was providing flexibility to grantees to use 
grant funds for immediate relief or personal protective equipment or finding innovative solutions 
for getting our products to the smallest communities we serve, Campbell remained steadfast in 
our commitment to our communities.OUR APPROACH

change in our communities. Therefore, the core criteria we use 
to inform our grant decisions include:
• How the organization’s work leads to behavior change that 
can be sustained by beneficiaries even when they are no 
longer directly participating in a program
• How the organization leverages other dollars and partner -
ships to sustain their work
• How well they take advantage of the skills of our employ -
ees to multiply their impact
• How effectively they engage residents in their work and 
use resident input to inform programming 
• Whether or not they partner across sectors to create  
systemic change . 
While our grant programs take different forms and have different 
levels of geographic reach, breadth and depth, as well as 
different processes – these criteria apply across them and help 
us gauge whether we are having the impact that we seek.SHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS

62Helping Our Communities  
in Times of Disaster
2020 has been a year unlike any other – we’ve faced disasters 
including a global pandemic, raging wildfires, and a record-  
breaking number of named hurricanes. Through it all, Campbell 
has remained steadfast in our commitment to our employees 
and local communities.
COVID-19
In March of 2020 when COVID-19 first took hold in the U.S., 
Campbell committed $1 million in food and funds to support 
our local communities. In the first nine months of the pandemic, 
that number grew to more than $8 million, as the needs of our 
communities and local nonprofits increased. Campbell provided 
an initial round of emergency relief grants and product donations 
to Feeding America food banks and local feeding programs in  
each of our 33 communities in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.  
Beyond initial emergency relief, Campbell has provided a wide 
range of support to our partners to aide their evolving needs. 
In Camden, New Jersey, we provided a $100,000 grant to the 
Camden Education Foundation to fund laptop computers for 
remote schooling needs and an additional $100,000 to the 
New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund to fight the medical, so -
cial and economic impact of COVID-19 on New Jersey’s most 
vulnerable. Nationally, we partnered with Feeding America as 
part of the NFL Draft and provided a $500,000 grant to support 
increased financial need from network food banks due to a 
shift in distribution models to serve clients.
In all areas of our business, Campbell employees developed 
innovative ways to support their local communities during  
the pandemic. Campbell’s Foodservice Team, which sells  
Pacific Foods  plant-based beverages to coffee shops, shifted  marketing dollars toward donations and coupons totaling 
$30,000 to purchase and distribute food for local baristas out 
of work due to the closure of local coffee shops. In Norwalk, 
Connecticut and Camden, New Jersey, product from our com -
pany stores was donated to front-line workers at area hospi -
tals. In Canada, our marketing team shifted their Andy Warhol 
60th anniversary celebration campaign budget to distribute 
$300,000 CAD in grants to food banks across Canada.SHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS
NEIGHBORLY PARTNERSHIP
 
As part of our initial COVID-19 relief commitment, 
Campbell partnered with both national nonprofits and 
small feeding programs in 33 communities where we 
have operations across North America to donate Campbell 
product. Sometimes these organizations were in areas 
far from our distribution centers, which proved difficult 
to reach. Enter NFI - a Camden, New Jersey-based 
international third-party logistics provider and Campbell 
supplier, which offered to take our donations to those 
hard-to-reach partners, as part of their standard routes. 
NFI helped ensure the food got into the hands of those 
who needed it most.
“NFI is extremely grateful for the opportunity to work 
with our local partner, Campbell Soup Company, on this 
much needed endeavor,” said David Broering, President, 
Non-Asset Solutions at NFI Industries. “We recognize 
that food banks around the country are struggling to 
meet demand in these unprecedented times, and we 
feel fortunate to be in a position to help those in need 
around the U.S. in this small way.”63SHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS
Natural Disasters
In addition to navigating the realities our communities faced 
during COVID-19, many areas of the country were struck with 
countless natural disasters, including Hurricane Dorian in 2019, 
tornadoes in Nashville, Tennessee, Hurricanes Laura, Sally, 
Delta and more in 2020, and massive, destructive wildfires in 
California and Oregon. Campbell provided consistent support  
to communities affected by these disasters through our flag -
ship partners, American Red Cross, Convoy of Hope, Team 
Rubicon and Feeding America. More than $250,000 in direct 
grants and product donations was provided in support of the 
2019 and 2020 hurricane seasons.
The Oregon wildfires displaced our Pacific Food s and Kettle 
Brand  employees due to mandatory evacuations. Thankfully, 
our employees, their families and homes were safe, but to 
support them for costs incurred due to evacuations, Campbell 
activated our Emergency Assistance Foundation Fund, and 
provided grants to 10 employees, totaling $7,500.
Employees Step Up  
When Disaster Strikes
In early April when personal protective equipment (PPE)  
was scarce, team members in our Denver, Pennsylvania, and  
Napoleon, Ohio, manufacturing plants stepped up to the plate 
and put their sewing skills to the test. They made face masks 
and encouraged others to do the same, generating 7,000 
masks for Campbell employees in just two weeks. Wondering 
what they could do to help, Campbell employees in our Cam -
den headquarters and our Paris, Texas, manufacturing facility 
donated food to local food banks and front-line health care 
workers using funds from their federal stimulus payments.  
Coming together to support those impacted by the COVID-19 
pandemic, Campbell employees donated more than $36,000 
to our COVID-19 Community Response Fund, which aided  
the relief efforts of the CDC Foundation, Center for Disaster 
Philanthropy, Feeding America and Convoy of Hope. With  
a 100% match from the Campbell Soup Foundation, more  
than $72,000 was contributed to support the impactful work  
of these organizations.In the wake of devastating wildfires in the Oregon 
community many of our Campbell employees call home, 
one employee, with the support of leadership at our 
Salem, Oregon plant, took his work calls remotely while 
helping transport 50 chickens, six cows, 35 goats and six 
horses out of fire zones and to safety.
64Campbell’s Healthy Communities
Our signature community affairs program, Campbell’s Healthy Communities, is a 10-year, $10 million commitment to measurably 
improve the health of young people in our hometown communities. Launched in 2011, Campbell’s Healthy Communities brings 
together an ecosystem of partners that work together and conduct mutually reinforcing activities, primarily in our headquarters  
of Camden, New Jersey. The work focuses on four areas that we believe make communities healthier: food access, nutrition 
education, physical activity and public will. Activities take place across a variety of settings, including schools, health care sites  
and food retailers.SHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS
Pivoting to Meet the  
Need during COVID-19
Our Campbell’s Healthy  
Communities organizations 
have worked collaboratively 
at KIPP Cooper Norcross 
Academy in Camden over the 
past six years, building school 
gardens, teaching nutrition 
education lessons, offering after-school physical activity 
programs, assisting with taste tests and food distributions, 
and transforming the food in the cafeteria. But, in March 
of 2020, programming ceased as schools closed and these 
partners quickly pivoted to help support KIPP as it became 
a designated food pantry to feed the community, while 
also continuing to provide school meals to students. Incorporating Student 
Voices with the Camden 
Youth Advisory Council
Another exciting component  
of our Campbell’s Healthy  
Communities program is our 
Camden Youth Advisory Council 
(CYAC), a group of high school 
students who serve as advisors 
and thought partners to our work. In FY2020, CYAC 
members led a mini-grant program with the Delaware 
Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) to learn 
about city planning and grant writing. Students conducted 
research, a walking audit of Camden, New Jersey, along 
with a mapping exercise to identify three priority areas 
– safe streets, healthy food access and parks and green 
space. Students invited local nonprofits to apply and 
ultimately selected and funded five projects to improve 
their local neighborhoods.
65SHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS
Campbell Soup Foundation
The Campbell Soup Foundation’s grantmaking has two main 
portfolios: one focused on fostering a healthy school food 
environment, building off the success of our work in schools 
through our signature program, Campbell’s Healthy Communities; 
and a second focused on supporting our individual Campbell 
communities through Community Impact Grants. In FY2020,  
the Campbell Soup Foundation pivoted to focus on COVID-19 
relief and recovery.
Improving School Food
With our signature program, Campbell’s Healthy Communities, 
having just finished year nine of the 10-year initiative, we are 
beginning to look to the future, taking what we have learned 
from this program to launch our next initiative. In FY2020, the 
Campbell Soup Foundation allocated strategic funds toward 
our long-term priority of improving food offerings in schools. 
Building from the success at our KIPP schools in Camden, we 
are planning to take this work to the next level. Through a 
combination of larger grants to national partners and smaller 
grants in support of local organizations working on the ground 
in districts, we are helping create a school food environment in 
which all students have access to real, healthy food.
Investments supported:
• FoodCorps service members placed in schools across  
several districts, focusing on hands-on learning about 
healthy food and healthy school meals, while helping  
to create a school-wide culture of health
• Wellness in the schools’ efforts to rewrite school menus 
and train cafeteria staff to prepare fresh and healthy  
meals for kids
• Mini grants to improve equipment in cafeterias to make 
them conducive to healthy cooking and eating
HEALTHY CORNER STORE INITIATIVE
 
The Healthy Corner Store Initiative remains a highlight of 
the Campbell’s Healthy Communities program. Corner 
stores are a significant source of food, particularly in 
underserved communities, but these stores do not always 
stock fresh, healthy food choices. With Campbell’s support, 
local nonprofit The Food Trust provides store owners with 
technical assistance and support to stock and market 
healthy foods. In FY2020, this support included mini-
grants to store owners to assist them with immediate 
needs in the face of COVID-19. Starting with two stores 
in 2011, the initiative has grown to 42 stores (40% of all 
corner stores in Camden) that promote and sell healthy 
food, serving 13 low-income neighborhoods.
In FY2020, a Corner Store Owner Affinity Group and 
Purchasing Cooperative was formed. These groups will 
help ensure the sustainability of the Healthy Corner 
Store Initiative, as owners organize and band together 
to increase their purchasing power and advocate for 
their collective needs.

Community Impact Grants
Our Community Impact Grants Program was created to expand 
the geographic reach of our funding to more Campbell commu -
nities and to engage more employees in our grantmaking process. 
Through this program, we rely on select employee nominators 
from each of our Campbell locations to nominate nonprofit 
organizations operating in their communities to apply for a 
grant. Nominators are trained to identify organizations whose 
work aligns with our community affairs mission and focus areas 
and who meet the other criteria that Campbell considers when 
making grants. During FY2020, 35 organizations were selected, 
totaling $620,000 in grants and representing 20 Campbell 
locations across the U.S. The grants ranged between $15,000 
and $20,000.
Examples of FY2020 Community Impact grantees include:
• Growing Gardens,  which works with families, schools and 
correctional facilities to support fresh food access through 
urban farming and gardening in Tualatin, Oregon
• Together We Can Make a Difference Initiatives,  which 
focuses on preventing hunger in Henry County, Ohio, 
through empowering individuals in need and equipping 
them with skills to break the cycle of poverty
• 100 Gardens,  which provides hands-on educational 
opportunities for students to learn about aquaponics and 
environmental stewardship in Charlotte, North CarolinaFLEXIBILITY IN A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY 
 
In order to meet the needs of our nonprofit partners 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, Campbell allowed all 
FY2020 grantees flexibility in repurposing previously 
awarded grant funds for immediate needs. Sixteen 
grants, totaling more than $200,000 were repurposed 
for COVID-19 relief, allowing partners to fund pivots to 
new distribution models, increased demand for services 
and personal protective equipment. In addition, the 
Campbell Soup Foundation committed an additional  
$1 million in relief grants for the remainder of FY2020.  
As the pandemic wears on and needs continue to grow 
across our Campbell footprint, Trustees of the Campbell 
Soup Foundation allocated all FY2021 direct grant support 
toward COVID-19 recovery.
For Pacific Foods, nourishment 
is at the heart of everything 
they do: from products that are 
made from simple, carefully 
sourced ingredients to efforts 
to care for the environment 
and ongoing work to nourish 
the community. In 2019, Pacific 
Foods formalized its Nourish 
Every Kid community program 
with clear guidelines, partner -
ship parameters and an 
outreach plan to ensure they 
were reaching the most people 
with the greatest need.
For years, Pacific has run 
multiple donation initiatives, 
including its flagship effort: donating over 100,000 meals each 
year to local children in partnership with local food banks, 
elementary schools and donation centers. Nourish Every Kid 
was developed to help meet the needs of thousands of children 
in the Pacific Northwest who experience food insecurity on 
weekends and over school breaks when they don’t have access to what is often their primary source of 
nutrition – school meal programs. Each box 
contains enough food for three meals a day 
for three days. The boxes are designed to be 
small enough for a child to carry or fit in a 
backpack. Pacific Foods employees participate 
in box building by either volunteering individually 
or through team-building events.
Nourish Every Kid supports 23 schools and other organizations. 
The team is taking steps to formalize the program even more in 
coming years.DONATIONS THAT NOURISH EVERY KID  SHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS

WITH THE OREGON FOOD BANK,

PLEDGING OUR SUPPORT FOR  
RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY
 
In response to the multiple incidents of racism and injustice 
against Black Americans, in June 2020, CEO Mark Clouse 
reiterated his commitment to foster a more diverse and 
inclusive culture at Campbell where all employees feel safe, 
heard and valued. This commitment included a holistic 
Inclusion and Diversity strategy of which Advocacy is a key 
pillar. Strengthening our ally networks by supporting our 
employees, partners and the communities where we live 
and work, is central to this strategy. As part of this work, 
Campbell pledged $1.5 million over three years to nonprofit 
organizations working to raise awareness, advance educa -
tion and equity, promote social justice and fight racism and 
discrimination. An internal team that included the Campbell Soup Foundation, the Inclusion and Diversity team and the 
Black Resource Group identified nonprofits doing pivotal work in advancing this cause.  
Campbell made an initial donation of $400,000 to the Equal Justice Initiative and $100,000 to the Boris L. Henson 
Foundation, which work to eradicate injustice and support the mental health of Black people across the U.S., respectively. 
Our Pacific Foods Team started a partnership with the Black Food Sovereignty Coalition, an organization which focuses 
on agriculture to help Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) growers, policymakers, advocates and educators 
stabilize food systems and infrastructure for marginalized communities in the Pacific Northwest. In addition, Campbell  
created an employee fund which included the aforementioned organizations in addition to the NAACP Legal Defense 
and Education Fund, Black Girls Who Code and the National Urban League. The Campbell Soup Foundation matched  
all gifts to this fund at 100%, raising a total of $18,300. Campbell launched three social justice funds with our Employee 
Resource Groups in FY2020, with an additional five slated to be launched in FY2021.

Rooted in the beliefs of our Founders, we have been making food 
that we are proud to serve in our own homes since 1869. The work 
we do every day is guided by our values, as we strive to fulfill the 
promise of our purpose, and deliver our corporate responsibility 
goals. Thank you for inviting us into your homes for these many 
years and for joining us on our journey to make delicious food that 
is rooted in goodness, prepared with care and accessible to all.REAL FOOD THAT 
MATTERS FOR  
LIFE’S MOMENTS
6869GOVERNANCE
We continue to make transparency a priority, embedding it in our 
new strategic plan and expanding both what it means and its 
audience beyond consumers. The following principles will guide 
our decision-making, measurement, reporting, communication 
and engagement. We are committed to:
• Understanding the expectations of all stakeholders, including 
our employees, so that we can build trust
• Engaging on the topics that matter most to our stakeholders 
and that impact society, the economy and the environment
• Providing communications that are always honest, timely, 
relevant and accessible
Our governance structure reflects this priority with company-wide 
decision-making taking place at the Campbell Leadership Team 
(CLT) level, which is then integrated into our two divisions – Snacks 
and Meals & Beverages – by our division heads and supported 
by corporate responsibility and sustainability through the Strategic 
Planning Process. In FY2020, we also had sustainability leads  
in each division responsible for ensuring sustainability was 
integrated into business strategies, plans and operations. 
We have a Sustainability Steering Committee, sponsored by 
the Executive Vice President of Global Supply Chain, who is also 
a member of the CLT. Led by our Vice President of Corporate 
Responsibility & Sustainability, the Steering Committee serves  
as the advisory body for the development and achievement  
of Campbell’s sustainability strategy and goals.
Together with Ernst & Young, we organized a workshop with 
leaders across Campbell on how to integrate environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) risk factors into our existing Enterprise 
Risk Management (ERM) process. The Corporate Responsibility 
& Sustainability team worked in collaboration with the Audit team, which manages the ERM process, to design a four-hour 
educational session for colleagues from Legal, Procurement, 
Strategy, IT, Human Resources, Marketing, Operations, Sales, 
R&D, Quality, Nutrition, Regulatory and Government Affairs. 
Since this initial internal engagement, we were able to include five 
ESG risk factors into our ERM process in FY2020. Two of these 
risk factors, Supply Chain Resiliency and Commodity Availability 
and Crisis Management, were included in the top 10 risks for the 
enterprise and will be more fully integrated into management 
systems and processes moving forward.Campbell’s commitment to corporate responsibility is reflected in our purpose, Real food that matters 
for life’s moments . Because of this, our governance structure helps ensure that corporate responsibility 
is integrated into our business decisions. In FY2020, we continued to deepen this integration, moving 
the corporate responsibility and sustainability function under the legal department and delegating 
Board oversight of environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities to the Governance Committee 
of the Board of Directors. On at least an annual basis, ESG goals and progress are now presented to the 
Governance Committee. We also continued to link incentive compensation with sustainability progress 
for both our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Supply Chain.70

expectations, highlights important policies and summarizes 
certain fundamental legal requirements that employees must 
follow. Employees receive a copy of the Code  when they join 
Campbell and participate in training regularly. The Code  was

GRI 307: Environmental Compliance
103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its boundary 10-K p. 5
103-2 The management approach and its components Campbell Soup Company manages environmental compliance through the use of 
an electronic system, the Campbell’s Environmental Management & Metrics System 
(CEMMS). The CEMMS system is used at all of our facilities and is the backbone of 
our overall compliance monitoring. The CEMMS system addresses our document 
management, permit tracking, tasks and calendar management, incident and 
inspection notifications, and PSM/RMP documentation control. While this system 
is auditable and supports ISO 14001, our compliance monitoring is not ISO 14001 
certified, and we currently do not have any facilities that are ISO 14001 or OHSAS 
18001 certified. 
Campbell’s environmental group uses CEMMS data to provide a monthly report to 
Supply Chain leadership for the purpose of identifying environmental compliance 
status and open issues throughout owned manufacturing and distribution centers. 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach

of origin and undergo a social and environmental risk assessment, which determines

Campbell has a long history of actively monitoring pesticide residues on 
incoming ingredients via our own internal chemical residue testing laboratory. 
Ingredients and suppliers are selected for sampling using a risk-based approach 
using internal and external data sources on likely residue risk to set sampling 
frequency. In tomato ingredients, Campbell’s number one ingredient type for 
our legacy brands, we have over a decade of requiring farmer compliance with 
Campbell pesticide requirements which are stricter than U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) and California EPA standards. Farmer pesticide 
application reports are monitored, and tomato farmers out of compliance with 
these requirements cannot harvest their fields for Campbell.

Assessing Our Water Stewardship and Risks
In partnership with a third-party firm, Campbell conducted a comprehensive 
water risk assessment encompassing all of our plants to look at water from 
three risk categories: 
• Local basin-level water risk
• Assessment of future water risk
• Financial or strategic water risk impacts on the business
It was determined that none of Campbell’s facilities are currently at high risk 
for water quality and/or quantity impacts, and the assessment also found that 
our programs and management approaches were leading or near leading among 
our peers and sector leaders. It also highlighted an opportunity to better connect 
our stewardship with setting risk-informed goals and incorporating water as a 
material risk into our governance. We completed third-party assurance of our 
water data for the second time and have committed to do this annually. In FY2021, 
we plan to complete a value chain water risk assessment and quantify water 
use upstream and downstream of our operations.

designs and materials by 2030.
2. Increase the use of post-consumer recycled content and incorporate 
25% post-consumer recycled content into polyethylene terephthalate 
(PET) bottles by 2030.
3. Drive increases in recycling rates through standardized on-pack 
labeling by including the How2Recycle label on 100% of packaging by 
2022.
4. Expand access to recycling and advance the development of 
infrastructure to improve the collection and recycling of packaging by
