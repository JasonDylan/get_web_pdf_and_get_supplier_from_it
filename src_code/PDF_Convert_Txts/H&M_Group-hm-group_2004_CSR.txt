RESPONSIBILITY
REPORT 2004
Stockholm 15 April 2005
Dear Reader,
2004 has been a very exciting year for us in terms of developments 
within the field of social responsibility in our supply chain. We have 
engaged in an internal evaluation of our progress after more than 
12,000 audits during the last seven years. The result of the evalua-
tion was a shift in our strategy. Monitoring has led to substantial 
improvements and is still important but we find that we have to 
focus more on finding sustainable solutions together with our supp-
liers. We have realized that we have to start asking the question 
“why” things are wrong rather than just observing “what” is wrong.  
Only when we can address the root cause will it be possible to 
achieve sustainable change. We have come to the conclusion that 
many problems stem from poor management practices at our supp-
liers’ factories, but we also need to analyse our own practices as 
well as external factors. And we need to apply more of a bottom up 
approach and listen more to the workers than we have done so far.
During 2005 a new computer application will be developed that 
will allow us to register data from audits in a way that enables us to 
more easily quantify progress in the social area. However, since our 
monitoring focus is rapidly shifting from “policing” to constructive 
interaction with suppliers to achieve sustainable improvements, the 
result of our work may not always be measurable in figures. As our 
CSR work develops we still have to find ways to report progress in 
a way that makes sense to our stakeholders. Within this process, a 
continued dialogue with our stakeholders about our reporting will be 
invaluable.In last year’s report I expressed regrets about the quality of our 
reporting of carbon dioxide emission figures in 2002. I would cer -
tainly not have expected to be forced to do the same this year. We 
seem to have ended up in a quagmire of calculation errors, ques -
tionable calculation methods and mistakes in the reporting from 
external sources. We are now confident that the quality and accu -
racy of this year’s data is up to the mark. This is particularly impor -
tant since we have now formulated a five-year target for reduction of 
CO2 emissions with 2004 set as the base year.
Although our CSR report for 2003 has been very well received, we 
are aware that we can still improve our reporting in many ways. In 
order to make our CSR report for 2004 even more relevant to our 
stakeholders, we last year invited four representatives of NGOs, 
trade unions, ethical investors and the Swedish Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs to comment on our report. You can read about their feedback 
in this year’s report.
The reporting process continues to be an important part of our 
CSR team’s internal process of continuous improvement. At the 
same time we hope that it will give you, our readers, a better under -
standing of H&M’s philosophy and ambitions in the field of corporate 
responsibility. As usual we appreciate your feedback!

 CSR 2004 – OUR BUSINESS   5
STATEMENT FROM OUR
MANAGING DIRECTOR
As an international corporation, H&M has a 
social responsibility. It is important for us to 
maintain good relations with the world around 
us and to take responsibility for how people and 
the environment are affected by our activities. 
That is why we must listen to our customers, our 
staff and other stakeholders in society in order to 
understand the expectations that they have of us 
as a corporation.
During the year we reorganised our buying 
department, dividing it into two parts: buying 
and production. Thanks to this division, one 
section of our buying organisation is now able 
to focus entirely on our production offices and 
contacts with H&M’s approximately 700 inde -
pendent suppliers. This makes it much easier 
for the buying department to cooperate with our 
CSR department, which coordinates our efforts 
in the social and environmental areas. Since we 
are aware that H&M’s own actions can affect 
how well our suppliers are able to live up to our 
requirements, this is an important development. 
We are now focusing more on long-term busi -
ness relationships with our suppliers in which 
both the quality of the garments and the supp-
liers’ ability to comply with the requirements laid 
down in H&M’s Code of Conduct are essential 
factors for our continued cooperation.On the environmental side, this year we have for -
mulated a measurable target for reducing carbon 
dioxide emissions from the company’s opera -
tions. Our objective is to reduce emissions by 
ten per cent in five years in relation to turnover. 
It is important for H&M to have a presence in 
the production countries so that our own staff 
can check that the working conditions in the 
production units are acceptable and that child 
labour is not being used. However, we should 
not forget either that producing our merchandise 
creates many job opportunities. I think we should 
take pride in the fact that more than 600,000 
people worldwide are employed in factories that 
produce goods for H&M. A further 45,000 people 
are now employed within H&M’s own operations. 
Job creation is also a social responsibility.

CSR VISION AND STRATEGY
CSR AS DEFINED BY H&M
H&M has chosen to define CSR as “a concept whereby com -
panies integrate social and environmental concern in their 
business operations and in their interaction with their stake -
holders on a voluntary basis in order to meet or exceed the 
ethical, legal, commercial and public expectations that society 
has of business”.CSR Vision
To uphold human rights, contribute to sustainable development and 
thereby earn trust from our stakeholders.
CSR Strategy
H&M’s business strategy is to continue to grow whilst maintaining 
good profitability. H&M believes that long-term profitability and good 
relations with the world around depend on us taking responsibility 
for how people and the environment are affected by our activities. 
The following quote from our environmental policy sums up H&M’s 
general strategy on corporate social responsibility very well: 
“Continuous improvements are significant for all H&M activi -
ties. This includes our environmental and social efforts, which are 
conducted within the framework of our business operations. H&M’s 
business concept is to give our customers unsurpassed value by 
offering fashion and quality at the best price. Our quality concept 
is based on ensuring that our customers are satisfied with our 
products and H&M as a company. To this end, we are committed 
to acting responsibly in our community. We will also cooperate with 
our suppliers to improve the social and environmental standards in 
the factories that manufacture H&M clothing, thereby contributing to 
sustainable development in these areas.” ■ CSR 2004 – OUR BUSINESS   7
MAIN RESPONSIBILITY
ASPECTS
1 In this report, the term ‘supplier’ 
denotes a prime contractor 
which supplies products to 
H&M, and which consequently 
has a direct business relation -
ship with H&M. Our suppliers 
may have factories of their own, 
or subcontract all or parts of 
production.
2 An individual or company hired 
by a prime contractor (supplier) 
to perform a specific task as 
part of the overall project. Thus, 
a subcontractor does not have 
a direct business relationship 
with H&M.
3 In this report, the term ‘produc -
tion unit’ refers to factories that 
produce garments for H&M, both 
suppliers’ and subcontractors’ 
factories.  H&M has identified a number of responsibility aspects in the area 
of CSR. These aspects are what we consider the most pressing 
aspects within our industry, especially with regard to our supply 
chain. 
Social aspects 
H&M does not own or operate any factories. We work together 
with approximately 700 suppliers1, who in turn use subcontrac -
tors2. About 2,000 production units3 around the world manufacture 
our goods. More than half of these production units are located 
in countries where it is probable that local labour law, and univer -
sally accepted human rights and labour standards are not always 
observed. 
Our risk assessments as well as several years of experience in 
monitoring garment factories has shown that the main aspects 
are violations of laws concerning working hours and wages. Other 
pressing issues, although less common, are child labour, forced 
overtime, physical and verbal abuse, sexual harassment and unac -
ceptable punishments. Unclear employment conditions, lack of 
employment contracts, misuse of trainee status and exploitation of 
migrant workers are other examples of violations that occasionally 
occur.
In our Code of Conduct, we make it clear that we do not accept 
any of the above mentioned violations. Nonetheless, we do see 
potential for improvement, and believe that it is important that we 
as a buyer work together with our suppliers in order to achieve 
progress.  Environmental aspects
The most substantial environmental effects occur in the dyeing and 
processing of fibres and fabrics. Examples of aspects in garment 
production are energy consumption, water pollution, and chemical 
handling. H&M’s Code of Conduct includes environmental require -
ments. 
Transportation of H&M goods accounts for approximately 46 per 
cent of total carbon dioxide emissions caused by H&M operations.  
It is therefore vital for H&M, in cooperation with our transport service 
providers, to aim for more environment-friendly transport. 
At the end of 2004, H&M operated 1,068 shops and 15 distribu -
tion centres. Our operations result in waste from packaging, hangers, 
decorative materials, disposable materials etc. It is our ambition to 
reduce waste and re-use and recycle waste material whenever pos -
sible. 
Health and safety aspects
All our suppliers have signed an agreement to abide by established 
chemical restrictions. In this way, we contribute to the reduction of 
environmental harm during the manufacture of our goods as well 
as during the burning and recycling of worn out clothing. Due to 
continuously increased awareness about the negative effects of 
various substances, our chemical restrictions are regularly updated. 
Our restrictions concern chemicals used in the production of H&M 
clothing and cosmetics.  
Anyone who uses, works with, or in any other way comes into 
contact with our products must feel confident that there is no risk 
of being exposed to hazardous chemicals, sharp objects or easily 
flammable fabrics, for example. There are extra safety requirements 
for baby and children’s products. ■ CSR 2004 – OUR BUSINESS   8
OUR PRODUCTS
H&M offers fashion and quality at the best price through a wide and 
varied range of fashion, divided into different concepts. The range 
covers everything from updated classics and basics to clothes that 
reflect the very latest international trends. It also includes underwear, 
sportswear, accessories and cosmetics. The largest department is 
women’s wear, followed by children’s wear, teenage fashion and 
men’s wear. The majority of our stores are full-range stores, but 
H&M also has concept stores offering garments for women, men, 
teenagers or children only, and stores that sell only cosmetics, linge -
rie and accessories.H&M has been selling cosmetics since 1975. Today, the range 
consists of make-up, body care and hair care products as well as 
accessories for women, men and teenagers. 
Since 1980, H&M has offered its customers an alternative and  
convenient way to shop by mail order through H&M Rowells. 
In 1998 it became possible to shop at H&M on the internet. 
Internet shopping is available to customers in Sweden, Denmark, 
Finland and Norway. We see the internet as one of several distribu -
tion channels, but we anticipate that the bulk of our sales will con -
tinue to be made in our shops. ■
H&M IN BRIEF

OUR PURCHASING PROCESS
Suppliers
We do not own any factories. Instead, we work with around 700 
suppliers. Approximately 60 per cent of the production takes place 
in Asia, and the rest mainly in Europe. We make an effort to cooperate 
only with suppliers who meet a number of requirements relating for 
instance to capacity, quality, lead times and compliance with our 
Code of Conduct. H&M endeavours to bring about long-term rela -
tionships with suppliers. Continuous cooperation with our suppliers 
helps us to ensure that our requirements are met.
Production offices
In order to be able to follow up production, H&M has 22 produc -
tion offices: ten in Europe (e.g. Italy, Turkey), ten in Asia (e.g. China, 
Bangladesh) and one each in Central America and Africa. The 
production offices employ approximately 700 people. The role of 
the production offices is to serve as links between the buying office 
in Stockholm, Sweden and the suppliers. Our production office 
staff places orders, oversees production, and follows up on H&M’s 
requirements including Code of Conduct compliance and quality.
Distribution
Every stage in the transport chain, starting with the forwarder, is 
controlled by H&M which acts as importer and retailer. Once the gar -
ments are ready for shipment, they are distributed to H&M’s shops 
via distribution centres. Most sales countries have a distribution 
centre where the garments are checked and sent on to the shops. 
Having few links and as few stops as possible in the distribution 
chain makes the supply of goods efficient. H&M sells more than  
600 million garments and accessories annually.Multi-Fibre Agreement 
During 2004 discussions were held in many international forums 
about the potentially negative effects for some production markets 
of the phase out of the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA). Fears were 
raised that countries previously benefiting from the system, such 
as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, would lose market share to China 
and India. H&M has been following the discussions closely and has 
evaluated the potential effects for our own business. Although it is 
too early to estimate the long-term effects of the abolition of quotas, 
H&M does not anticipate drastic short-term changes to our buying 
patterns. China has already imposed an export tax on certain gar -
ment categories. H&M will not be able to fully evaluate the effect of 
the MFA phase out until it is clear what potential measures might be 
taken by the US and the EU in order to limit imports from China. ■ CSR 2004 – OUR BUSINESS   10
OUR EMPLOYEES
At the end of the year, H&M had more than 45,000 employees. The 
average number of employees was 31,701 (converted into full-time 
positions), 20 per cent of whom were male. Net employment crea -
tion 2003/2004 was 15 per cent (net increase: 3,946 employees). 
The spirit of H&M creates commitment 
H&M’s strong corporate culture – the spirit of H&M – has existed 
ever since the days of H&M’s founder, Erling Persson. This strong 
culture is of great value and is a contributory factor to H&M’s suc -
cess over the years.   
The spirit of H&M is based on a number of values that describe 
in simple terms how we want to work. These are in turn based on 
our business concept – fashion and quality at the best price. The 
fundamental values behind the spirit of H&M include common sense 
and own initiative. AVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

Within H&M we provide room for people to make their own deci -
sions and take responsibility, and employees get regular feedback 
on their performance. It is an important part of H&M’s culture that 
responsibility is delegated to the shops. Great commitment is 
essential and employees are expected to take their own initiative 
within certain given confines. Creativity and job satisfaction increase 
when there is a good working environment. 
Our employees’ commitment makes a major contribution to 
H&M’s success. We believe in individuals’ abilities and encourage 
our employees to develop further. Respect for the individual is a 
fundamental value at H&M. This applies to everything from fair pay, 
reasonable working hours and freedom of association to the oppor -
tunity to grow and develop with the company.
Agreement with UNI 
On January 14 2004, H&M signed an agreement with the interna -
tional trade union network UNI1. This agreement declares in writing 
that both parties consider the ILO2 Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work3 to be the cornerstone for their 
cooperation. It also makes H&M’s corporate policy on, among other 
areas, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining 
at H&M’s workplaces clear to parties both within and outside the 
company. It is of the utmost importance to ensure the observance of 
these principles. The US Case 
H&M’s core values apply to all H&M employees. The USA is no 
exception. H&M is a rapidly expanding company, and having good 
relations with employees and the organisations that represent them, 
are prerequisites for this expansion. This is the reason why H&M 
offers its American workers better-than-average wages and working 
conditions. 
On April 12 2004 it was publicly announced that 53 per cent of the 
employees at H&M’s US distribution centre had voted to join and 
be represented by the trade union UNITE HERE4 (formerly known as 
UNITE). This means that all employees at this place of work are now 
represented by UNITE HERE in on-going negotiations. 
In order to reach a satisfactory agreement concerning whether 
other H&M workplaces in the USA should be organised, discussions 
have been held with the international organisation UNI, the central 
US trade union AFL-CIO5, and representatives from the unions 
UFCW6 and UNITE HERE. The process to decide if a union has a 
majority at an H&M workplace, and thereby is entitled to represent 
the employees of that workplace in negotiations with H&M, should 
be in line with American practice. Furthermore, it should be carried 
out in a manner that protects the integrity of our employees, and 
makes it possible for every worker to make an independent decision. 
This is the basic guideline for H&M’s proposal to those American 
unions that seek to organise our employees in the USA.  ■1 Union Network International

benefits amounted to SEK 8,368,000, which included a bonus of 
SEK 1,500,000 (previous year SEK 8,358,000 including a bonus of 
SEK 1,500,000). Pension expenses for the Managing Director during 
the year were SEK 6,319,000 (previous year SEK 23,290,000), of 
which SEK 2,641,000 comprises pension commitments entered as 
liabilities. The Managing Director may retire at the age of 62 and 
receive a pension of 65% of regular salary until ordinary pension age.
From the age of 65 the Managing Director will receive a lifelong 
old-age pension of 50% of the regular salary effective at the time. 
The Managing Director is entitled to 12 months’ notice. In the event 
that the company should cancel his contract of employment the 
Managing Director will receive an extra year’s salary as severance pay, 
in addition to the 12 months’ notice. There are no other agreements 
regarding severance pay in the Group. The Managing Director’s 
terms of employment are decided by the Board.Terms of employment for other Group senior executives 
Remuneration to other members of the Group management in 
the form of salary and benefits amounted to SEK 23,835,000 
(19,215,000), which included bonuses of SEK 2,000,000 (SEK

beyond the usual plan which cover certain senior employees. The 
retirement age for these varies between 60 and 62 years. The cost of 
these payments has been covered by separate insurance policies.
In addition, a bonus amounting to SEK 6.1 m (6.0) was paid to 13 
country managers. The terms of employment for other members of 
the group management are decided by the Managing Director and 
the Chairman of the Board. CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   13
Bonus system
The Managing Director, country managers and certain senior execu -
tives are included in a bonus system. The size of the bonus is based 
on 0.2% of the increase in the ordinary dividend decided by the 
Annual General Meeting, which is then adjusted to take account of 
the result in their respective areas of the business. The maximum 
bonus per person and year has been set at SEK 500,000.
In the case of the managing director the bonus is 0.6% of the ordi -
nary dividend increase, up to a maximum of SEK 1,500,000.
The bonus paid after tax must be invested in its entirety in shares 
in the company, which must be held for a minimum of five years.

SECURITY AT H&M
Our security policy guides our security work. Attention is centred on:
■ Fire prevention and evacuation
■ Loss prevention
■ Crime prevention
Security organisation
Generally, the manager for each H&M unit is responsible for security 
issues. At the managers’ service, there is a corporate organisation 
to facilitate and govern the security work in the Group. The head of 
security reports to the Managing Director. The corporate organisa -
tion also has security managers for information and information 
technology, as well as internal audit. In addition, the following H&M units have security managers: 
■ Buying department and production offices 
■ Sales offices and shops
■ H&M Rowells 
■ IT department
Every shop manager must, in collaboration with the country’s secu -
rity manager, analyse the risks of crime against the shop and train 
the staff accordingly. We report all types of internal and external 
crime to the police. Any employee who has been found guilty of 
committing a crime against the company will be dismissed.
Combating bribery 
H&M does not give or take any form of bribes. We dissociate our -
selves from all types of corruption. This applies to every individual 
employed by H&M, regardless of business area or position. Our 
Code of Ethics defines what is considered to be corrupt behaviour. 
The 700 or so employees in our production offices sign this docu -
ment when they are hired. 
In addition, our suppliers have signed to confirm that:
■ they have fully understood H&M’s Code of Ethics,
■ the requirements in H&M’s Code of Ethics are not in any way  
 contradictory to national law,
■ they undertake to comply with H&M’s Code of Ethics, and take  
 responsibility for informing all their subcontractors about the  
 content of the Code of Ethics, and to make sure the  
 subcontractors also comply accordingly. SECURITY POLICY
H&M must be a place where both staff and customers can feel safe. 
Every employee of the company must, in their daily work and personal 
behaviour, strive to create a working climate that avoids the risk of fire, 
criminal behaviour and damage to both customers and staff - without 
in any way limiting space for spontaneity and creativity in daily activi -
ties together or hindering sales in the company’s shops. 
A properly functioning security system, where everything is ordered 
and well organised, creates a safer place in which to work; it redu -
ces the company’s costs for damage and loss and contributes to 
increased profitability and comfort.
The person responsible for security is always the manager for each 
respective H&M unit. It is possible to delegate part of this responsibi -
lity, but the ultimate responsibility always lies with the manager. It is 
the business of every employee to take part in security work and to 
contribute to safety at H&M.  CSR 2004 – OUR BUSINESS   15
Our suppliers are also requested to inform the production office 
manager immediately if there is any suggestion of corruption when 
dealing with H&M staff.
Security managers at the production offices conduct internal 
reviews of the Code of Ethics procedure to make sure that it has 
been implemented correctly. If an employee is found accepting 
bribes of any kind, the matter will be reported to the police for 
investigation. If a supplier does not comply with our company policy 
on this matter, we will be forced to discontinue all business connec -
tions with this supplier.
During 2004 we have had a few breaches of our Code of Ethics. 
Not all cases are closed and hence the consequences of these 
breaches are still pending.
Information and IT security 
Our Information Security Policy and Guidelines guide all security 
work on information and IT. These instructions cover:
■ Organisation and responsibility
■ Asset cl assification and control
■ Document and information management
■ Physical security
■ Communication and operations management
■ Access control
■ Systems development and maintenance
■ Routines for incident management
■ Business continuity pla nning
The intention is for H&M’s security work to be harmonised with the 
SS-ISO/IEC-17799 standard for information security management. 
All our work must at least meet legal requirements.Policy on information and IT security
The levels of the security procedures depend on the possible dam -
age that could be inflicted on H&M’s businesses.
Responsibility and support
Security is a line responsibility that extends from the operation 
manager all the way down to the co-worker. The information security 
manager coordinates and monitors the security work and revises 
the security level – he/she is the business support within the infor -
mation security area.INTERNET POLICY
Rapid access to correct information is important if we are all to do 
our jobs in the best way possible. The Internet is a source of informa -
tion that can be used to supplement and rationalise this knowledge 
gathering. The Internet is intended for the gathering of information and 
knowledge for business purposes. Employees must be aware that it is 
an external medium in which - as in all other external situations – he or 
she is representing the company. Employees who wish to have access 
to information on the Internet from their PC in order to carry out their 
work undertake to abide by the following Internet policy.
■ Websites that supply pornographic, racist, or other unethical or  
 unlawful information must not be visited from H&M’s computers.  
 Storage of such information on H&M’s computers is absolutely  
 prohibited and may result in dismissal.
■ The user shall always be responsible for observing the necessary  
 security measures, copyright rules and licensing procedures for  
 software, sound and images when downloading via the Internet.
■ The employee does not object to the company checking the   
 Internet addresses to which he/she has been connected.  CSR 2004 – OUR BUSINESS   16
Risk analysis
Damage prevention and damage-limiting measures shall be pre -
ceded by a risk analysis and the cost must be in proportion to the 
identified risks.
Consequences of disregarding laws,  
regulations, and internal rules
Employees who do not follow laws and regulations may be dis -
missed. Employees who do  ot follow the internal rules may be given 
a warning and in serious cases may be dismissed. We report all 
types of crime to the police. 
Privacy policy
We have a privacy policy on our web site www.hm.co m. Our privacy 
policy is based on PUL, which is a Swedish law that regulates 
personal data handling. PUL is based on the EU Directive 95/46/EC 
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 
on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of 
personal data and on the free movement of such data. The provision 
concerning cookies is based on the law on electronic communica -

LISTENING TO OUR
STAKEHOLDERS
During 2004, H&M met with various stakeholders at conferences 
and other meetings. Among others we had fruitful discussions with:
■ international, European and national trade unions such as  
 ITGLWF1, UNI2, ETUF:TCL3, Industrifacket4, and Handels-
 anställdas förbund5. We also held meetings with local trade
 unions in several production countries, among them Turkey   
 and Bangladesh.
■ representatives from various NGOs such as Clean Clothes   
 Campaign (www.cleanclothes.or g), Greenpeace  
 (www.greenpeace.or g), Amnesty International (www.amnesty.or g),  
 Oxfam (www.oxfam.or g), WWF (www.wwf.or g), UNICEF  
 (www.unicef.or g), as well as a number of Swedish NGOs.  
 We have also held a dialogue with local NGOs and UN agencies  
 in many countries where our garments are produced, such as  
 Bulgaria, Cambodia, Bangladesh and India.
■ governmental representatives from the Swedish Ministry for  
 Foreign Affairs, and the EU Commission. We also held talks  
 with representatives of local governments in countries such as  
 Bangladesh and China.  
 In December 2004, H&M met with four stakeholders with various 
perspectives in order to receive structured feedback on our CSR 
reporting. 
■ Fair Trade Center is a Swedish non-profit organisation that works  
 for fair international trade.  (www.fairtradecenter.s e)
■ Banco is one of Sweden’s leading ethical fund managers.

■ Industrifacket (Industrial Workers’ Union) represents Swedish  
 workers from various industrial businesses, including textile  
 workers. (www.industrifacket.s e)

 is the Swedish government’s effort to persuade Swedish   
 companies to become ambassadors for human rights,  
 acceptable economic and social conditions and a good  
 environment. (www.ud.se/g a)
 We conducted indivi dual meetings where the stakeholders  
 could express their opinions on our 2003 CSR report. After this  
 meeting, each stakeholder was asked to give a written statement  
 on the report. Global Responsibility and Banco decided that  
 they did not wish to put their opinion in writing. The following  
 texts are extracts from The Industrial Workers’ Union’s and Fair  
 Trade Center’s written statements. The complete statements can

“We welcome H&M’s ambition to publish the social and environ -
mental costs of the production in a yearly CSR report. It is essential 
that companies disclose this to make it possible for consumers, 
investors and decision-makers to make ethically balanced choices 
and decisions. The report covers most areas relevant to a garment 
company like H&M. The most important area left out relates to envi -
ronmental effects and working conditions in the production of textile 
fibres, such as cotton.
H&M’s code of conduct states that ‘We have to make sure that 
nobody whose work contributes to our success is deprived of his 
or her human rights, or suffers mental or bodily harm.’ This is not 
the reality of H&M’s production today, and unfortunately this is not 
made clear in the report. The report does not describe the condi -
tions under which H&M’s products are produced. From the report 
it is impossible to see to what extent H&M’s code of conduct is 
followed. H&M holds much of this information already, and it should 
be presented.”  
Henrik Lindholm
Project leader
Fair Trade CenterIndustrifacket (Industrial Workers’ Union) 
“As we review H&M’s work with CSR issues, we see a company that 
sets high standards and takes social issues seriously. It is our under -
standing that the company wants the products sold in its shops to 
be manufactured under decent working conditions and without a 
negative impact on the environment. This is expressed in the fact 
that the company stands behind the ILO Core Conventions, the 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Global 
Compact.
Despite this, we, as a trade union with considerable international 
contacts, conclude that it is not enough. More needs to be done to 
ensure that everyone concerned is at least able to enjoy the condi -
tions that the company’s policy prescribes. 
We are convinced that the most important measure for better 
compliance with the company’s social policy is to make sure that 
the ILO Convention No. 87 (on the freedom of association) and No. 
98 (on the right to bargain collectively) are observed.”  ■

H&M’s CSR report is an integral part of H&M’s CSR work. The 
reporting process helps us to highlight the areas that we need to 
focus on within our organisation, and helps us set and follow up tar -
gets. This is a time-consuming process, parallel to a constant deve-  
lopment and improvement of tools, methods, IT support, staff 
capacity, projects, and interaction with partners and other stake -
holders. We are in no doubt that external verification of the report 
would add transparency and make the report more trustworthy. 
However, we combine the report with an open attitude to various 
stakeholders who contact us with follow-up questions or ask for ‘a 
look behind the scenes’. We do not exclude the possibility of having 
the report verified in the future; we clearly see a general develop -
ment in that direction. However, at the moment we prefer to focus 
on improving our CSR performance and prioritising the internal 
benefits of the report rather than spending time and other resources 
on an external verification process.  ■ CSR 2004 – OUR BUSINESS   20

OUR SOCIA L
RESPONSIBILITY
To make this section more accessible, we have divided it into 
two main parts. Code of Conduct Activities describes this 
year’s social performance and activities, including the Full 
Audit Programme (FAP), our new method for Code of Conduct 
monitoring. Code of Conduct Management explains the  
challenges that we face in different countries of production,
as well as our working methods. CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   24
PRODUCTION
H&M does not own or operate any factories. We buy our garments 
and other goods from approximately 700 independent suppliers,  
primarily in Asia and in Europe. 
SUPPLIERS  have direct business relationships with H&M. Our supp -
liers may have factories of their own, or subcontract parts or all of 
their production. 
SUBCONTRACTORS  are individuals or companies hired by suppliers 
to perform a specific task. Subcontractors thus do not have direct 
business relationships with H&M.
PRODUCTION UNITS  are factories that produce garments for H&M, 
and include both suppliers’ and subcontractors’ factories.Introduction to our Code of Conduct work 
H&M is a value-driven company that strives to conduct its business 
in a responsible manner. We want to live up to the expectations of 
our customers, employees and other stakeholders. The following 
quote from our Code of Conduct shows how we translate our values 
into a broadened responsibility for our supply chain.
 “H&M, as a strongly expanding multinational company, feels that 
it is increasingly important for us to take responsibility for all our 
actions, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world. Most impor -
tantly, we have a responsibility towards all the thousands of people 
taking part in the production of our garments. We have to make sure 
that nobody whose work contributes to our success is deprived of 
his or her human rights, or suffers mental or bodily harm.”The Convention on the Rights of the Child1 and the ILO’s Declaration 
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work2 form the basis for 
this Code of Conduct. In 1997, we published our Code of Conduct 
and in 1998, we made our first inspections. Since then, we have 
made more than 12,000 inspections. 
We continuously improve our monitoring programme and develop 
new tools and methods for implementation of the Code at our sup -
pliers’ factories. 
■ H&M’s Code of Conduct is found at  
 http://seit26.hm.com/codeofconduc t.
Cooperation on a long-term basis
H&M wishes to work with its suppliers on a long-term basis in order 
to achive a sustainable business relation that can benefit both par -
ties. By focusing on a limited number of key suppliers we gain better 
control over quality and working conditions. The number of suppli -
ers we work with is now around 700. 
We are sometimes asked why we do not immediately terminate 
our cooperation with suppliers who do not comply with our Code 
of Conduct. Obviously, that would be a simple solution for us, but 
H&M also feels a responsibility towards the people working in the 
factories. If H&M were to leave a factory due to poor management, 
the ones that would primarily be affected are the workers. The basis 
for sound cooperation is trust. Until proven otherwise, we have 
confidence in our suppliers and their subcontractors. However, we 
must not be naïve. For example, if we only make pre-announced 
inspections, fire safety and cleanliness etc. could be temporarily 
taken care of. 
Our monitoring work involves a strong element of awareness rais -
ing and education to make our suppliers understand the importance 
and the advantages of complying with our code.CODE OF CONDUCT ACTIVITIES

Dealing with violations
When we do encounter serious violations, a strong statement must 
be made. If the factory management is repeatedly faking documents 
or if a supplier has subcontracted production to a production site 
without informing H&M or otherwise refuses to cooperate, ultimately 
we are forced to cease the cooperation. When this does happen, we 
make an effort to terminate the business in a responsible manner in 
order to avoid sudden adverse affects for the workers.
Improved conditions
The improvements since the start of our monitoring programme 
have been substantial. The standard of fire safety and the working 
environment have been radically improved. In many cases, and 
according to the results of our evaluations, the working hours have 
come down and all workers now receive at least the legal minimum 
wage and frequently more. More and more factories also pay correct 
overtime rates. The right to paid annual leave, sick leave and mater -
nity leave has been radically improved. In countries with a social 
security system, a majority of the workers are now covered.
The work towards a truly sustainable supply chain, where human 
rights and workers’ rights are fully respected and there is minimum 
adverse impact on the environment, is hard and will take a long time. 
Improvements are difficult to measure in quantitative terms and the 
main focus of our work is still on describing our processes. 
The Full Audit Programme: A new platform  
for our Code of Conduct monitoring
During the year we have worked on developing a new platform for 
our future Code of Conduct work, called The Full Audit Programme 
(FAP). The new platform is the result of six years experience in Code 
of Conduct monitoring. In order to indicate the use of a different 
monitoring approach, we have changed our terminology slightly; what were previously termed inspections are now audits, and our 
inspectors are now called auditors. 
Until now, our work has primarily been focused on establishing  
a set of rules for our suppliers’ conduct and ensuring that they  
abide by these rules. We have focused on what is wrong rather 
than why things are wrong. By asking why, we will be able to guide 
our suppliers on how to achieve sustainable improvements in their 
organisation through effective policies, routines, control systems, 
target-setting, and follow-up systems (i.e. effective management 
systems). 
The new way of working will make it possible to detect compli -
ance issues at an earlier stage. Another feature of FAP is the pos -
sibility to select the most important suppliers in order to put heavier 
emphasis on them in the advisory and follow-up phases when 
implementing effective management systems. Furthermore, FAP 
has a risk management function where our production countries are 
divided into different risk categories based on past performance on 
human rights and workers’ rights. The most significant part of the 
FAP is the extended form of issues and questions being looked at, 
together with an increased depth in verification, primarily through 
worker interviews, but also through our document sampling tech -
nique. Worker interviews will be an integral part of FAP auditing. 
In December 2004 we held a workshop for all our Code of 
Conduct auditors in order to establish the new FAP platform and 
discuss how we can support our suppliers further. During 2005 we 
will educate all auditors on the new working methods, and the aim is 
to have FAP fully implemented by the end of 2005.
In the short term, our improved working method is likely to result 
in an increase in detected violations. However, in the long term we 
will be able to work more effectively with our suppliers towards sus -
tained compliance. It is our ambition to make it clearer for our sup -
pliers that Code of Conduct performance is an important part of the CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   26
Supplier Evaluation Process and that there is a clear link between 
volume of business and improved working conditions.
We want to increase the awareness among our suppliers that 
improvements in accordance with our Code of Conduct and their 
cooperation with us represent an investment in the future. We 
believe that our suppliers benefit from Code of Conduct-related 
improvements such as a decrease in overtime and better working 
conditions. Such improvements may result in lower staff turnover, 
increased productivity, higher quality, and possibly new business 
opportunities. This is a long-term commitment, in which construc -
tive dialogue with the factory managers is crucial. 
The auditors’ work gets more complex by the day. Sometimes, 
factory managers seem to go to great lengths to hide the actual 
facts from us. Faked time cards, faked salary records, subcontrac -
tors being used without our knowledge or approval, and workers 
being instructed on what answers to give in an interview are exam -
ples of what our auditors must be constantly vigilant against. This 
type of action from the suppliers’ side is a sign that we have not 
been able to convey the message that fair working conditions and a 
healthy working environment are good for business. We believe that 
our increased focus on good management practice rather than  
“a policing approach” will highlight the business benefits of improved 
practices for those suppliers. 
Some of our stakeholders have clearly indicated that they require 
more quantitative accounts of our work on improving working condi -
tions at our suppliers’ factories. We respect this view, but cannot 
currently show quantitative results. There are two main resons for 
this. One is the lack of IT support for data collection. This will be 
developed during 2005. The more important reason is the new and 
improved monitoring techniques (FAP) that will be introduced dur -
ing 2005. It is our hope that we will be more effective in identifying 
violations with our new working methods. As the FAP audits will MONITORING FACTORIES IN 2004
FACTO RIES
In 2004, about 700 suppliers and 2,000 production units were regis -
tered. Together, these production units had a workforce of around 
600,000 people. It should be noted that these workers also manufac -
ture garments for buyers other than H&M.  
AUDITS
The number of audits was 2,715 (2,578). One third of all audits in Asia 
and in Europe were unannounced. Approximately 70 per cent of our 
auditors work in Asia. 
AUDITS AT POTENTIAL NEW PRODUCTION UNITS
During the year, our auditors graded 16 potential production units (19) 
‘rejected’ for H&M production in spite of the fact that they were com -
mercially interesting for H&M. These units were graded ‘rejected’ at 
both the first audit and the follow-up audit and were subsequently not 
approved for H&M production. 
REJECTED PRODUCTION UNITS 
At the end of 2004, 143 production units (164) remained rejected from 
H&M production due to various Code of Conduct violations. These 
production units could be approved for H&M production if the required 
improvements were to be made.
PERMANENTLY REJECTED  
We permanently ceased business with 9 suppliers (10). Reasons for 
permanently rejecting a supplier could be repeated use of undeclared 
units, repeated child labour or repeated use of fake documentation.
■ Read more about our Code of Conduct grading scale on page 50. 
WORKSHOPS
20 workshops were organised for our suppliers and their subcontrac -
tors to educate them on how to comply with labour law and H&M’s 
Code of Conduct. The majority of all workshops were organised by 
H&M, but we also invited our suppliers and their subcontractors to 
workshops organised by other organisations. Around 380 factory mana -
gers and supervisors attended. CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   27
be more comprehensive, the yearly number of audits will also be 
reduced. A fair comparison beween the results in 2004 and 2005 
would therefore not be possible. We estimate that we will be ready 
to report more performance figures by 2007 at the earliest, when 
FAP has been fully implemented for one year, and 2006 can be used 
as the base year.
Investigating options on independent verification 
As we have previously reported, we are investigating options for 
independent verification of our internal monitoring system. Our main 
focus during the year has been on developing and improving our 
internal monitoring system, but discussions have also been held 
with both the Fair Labor Association (www.fairlabor.or g) and the Fair 
Wear Foundation (www.fairwear.n l). However, by the end of 2004, 
no decision had yet been taken to join either initiative. Independent 
verification is mainly interesting for us as a way to demonstrate to 
our stakeholders how our internal monitoring system functions. It 
could also serve as quality assurance internally.
Code of Conduct and cosmetic suppliers
In Sweden and Norway, H&M sells brands of cosmetics and hygiene 
articles other than H&M’s own. Of course H&M’s Code of Conduct 
also applies to those suppliers. However, after years of negotiation 
with these suppliers, a few still refuse to sign a commitment to 
comply with the Code. The Swedish Cosmetic, Toiletry & Detergent 
Association and the Norwegian Association of Cosmetics, Toiletries 
and Fragrance Suppliers have also advised their members not to 
sign H&M’s Code of Conduct.In order not to mislead our customers H&M has decided to publish 
the names of those suppliers and brands that have not signed 
H&M’s Code of Conduct in order to make it possible for our custo-
mers to make an informed choice. The suppliers/brands that have 
not signed and are not willing to continue discussions are: Procter 
& Gamble (Wella, Head & Shoulders, Max Factor, Olay, and Always) 
and The Gillette Company (Gillette razor products). 
Suppliers willing to discuss but who, because of their parent 
company’s policies or for other reasons, still have not signed H&M’s 
Code of Conduct are Lever Fabergé (Rexona, Lux, Dove, Sunsilk), 
Beiersdorf (Nivea, Labello), Henkel Norden (Poly Blonde, Gliss), 
and Colgate-Palmolive (Colgate and Palmolive). SCA Mölnlycke 
(Libresse, o.b.) in Norway has signed; however, the Swedish branch 
has not. 
Many international brands are sold through national agents in 
Sweden and Norway. In those cases the local agent may be willing 
to sign but is not allowed to do so by the brands it sells. This is 
most common with Procter & Gamble’s brands and such agents are 
Lepsoe and Marwel Hauge in Norway and Scandinavian Cosmetics 
in Sweden. 
H&M has no indication of or reason to believe that the above com -
panies and brands are violating our Code of Conduct, but we do not 
have the permission from those companies to verify this through 
audits. We therefore have to refer the full responsibility for any 
violation of H&M’s Code of Conduct to the suppliers of the above 
mentioned brands.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   28
Special focus on maternity leave in Bangladesh
During 2004, H&M has started a project focusing on maternity leave 
in Bangladesh. A majority of the garment workers in Bangladesh are 
women of child-bearing age. Based on our regular factory inspec -
tions, we have had reason to believe that not all women get the 
maternity benefits to which they are legally entitled. We have there -
fore carried out research among all our suppliers in Bangladesh on 
their maternity leave policy and on what percentage of the women 
have been on maternity leave during the last year. We also included 
research on whether or not there is a day-care centre in the factory 
and if there are trained carers in those centres. We also consulted 
local NGOs specialising in women’s issues to learn more about 
female factory workers’ views on motherhood and awareness of 
their rights to maternity leave. 
We found great differences between different factories. As few as 
0.1 per cent and up to 8.4 per cent of the women in various factories 
were utilising their right to maternity leave. On average, 2.3 per cent 
of the women were on maternity leave in one year. 53 per cent of 
the factories had day-care centres and 56 per cent of those have 
trained carers.
The main reason for the differences seems to be awareness 
among the women about their rights, and the factory manage -
ments’ lack of knowledge about the subject. We are now finalising 
our analysis of the research results, and in 2005 we are planning 
workshops for suppliers with low prevalence of women utilising their 
rights to maternity leave. There are several examples of good prac -
tice from other factories that we can build on. In cooperation with a 
local NGO we have also developed a video and information leaflets 
about maternity leave which have been used for a general education 
programme for garment workers. These materials will also be used 
for education of factory managers.Projects and dialogues with trade unions
One of the ILO’s core conventions (no. 87) guarantees all workers 
freedom of association. This is therefore also an important require -
ment in H&M’s Code of Conduct. The inspection methods used so 
far have not been sufficiently effective in verifying whether workers 
at factories supplying H&M enjoy this right. During the year we 
have sought dialogue and cooperation with trade unions both on 
an international and local level, to learn more about the situation 
in various countries and to establish valuable contacts. Examples 
include meetings with local trade unions in Turkey and Bangladesh, 
visits to our head office in Stockholm by unions from Cambodia 
and Bangladesh and a project in Bulgaria described in more detail 
below. During the meetings, H&M has gained a better understand -
ing of the difficulties many unions frequently face while trying to 
organise workers in garment factories. This has built up confidence, 
and we have now started to get indications from local unions when 
our suppliers are not respecting the workers’ right to freedom of FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION IN BANGLADESHI EPZS
Freedom of association has previously not been granted in Bangladesh 
Export Processing Zones (EPZ). In 2004 steps were taken in the right  
direction when new legislation (the EPZ Trade Union & Industrial Relations 
Bill 2004) increased workers’ right to organise. There are still reservations 
in the new legislation, but from November 2006 workers will have a limited 
right to organise in non-political trade unions. From February 2005 all  
factories in the EPZ are required to have Workers’ Representation and 
Welfare Committees (WRWC) that have been democratically elected. H&M 
has previously not approved any new suppliers in the EPZ as trade unions 
were not allowed. But given that the new legislation has been passed we 
are again accepting new suppliers in the EPZ as long as they have a  
functioning WRWC in accordance with the new legislation. CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   29
association. During the year we have had such cases in Thailand, 
Bangladesh and Turkey, for example, where workers have been 
laid off in connection with union activities. In those and other cases 
H&M has intervened and demanded that the workers should be 
reinstated at their previous jobs. Whether or not that has succeeded 
has depended a lot on H&M’s importance as a buyer at the factory, 
successful cooperation with other buyers as well as the workers’ 
actual interest in going back to work for the factory. In cases where 
workers have decided not to go back for various reasons, we have 
focused our efforts on making sure that workers are compensated 
according to the local law. In some cases we have actively tried to 
find other employment for such workers.
Bringing stakeholders together in Bulgaria
The apparel industry is important for Bulgaria, and the challenge for 
the future will be to maintain and increase the industry’s competi -
tiveness in the global market. An effort to build the Bulgarian apparel 
industry as a leader in CSR has brought together several stakehol-
ders in a project focusing on dialogue and capacity building. 
In a unique project during 2004, four international brands, the 
European Trade Union Confederation of Textile, one local NGO, two 
Bulgarian trade unions, ten suppliers (represented by mainly Greek 
owners, managers and workers), the Bulgarian Ministry of Labour 
and the General Labour Inspectorate came together to learn about 
CSR. The project was mainly financed by the EU Commission. This 
was probably the first time factory owners in Bulgaria had sat side 
by side with workers, brands and trade unions in a common work -
shop. From their various perspectives they came together to share 
their views about the advantages of social dialogue and CSR for the 
future of the Bulgarian garment industry.After the initial workshop in January 2004, almost 100 workers have 
participated in direct training, and have then disseminated the learn -
ing to more than 500 workers in the ten participating factories. The 
methodology used has been “improvement circles” where workers 
have come together and discussed various CSR-related subjects, 
leading to suggested improvements in the factories. The training 
also extended to several supervisors from each factory in order to 
create channels for internal dialogue.
The first goal of the project was to encourage constructive 
dialogue between the local stakeholders leading to increased 
cooperation. The second was to increase the awareness among 
management and workers about local, national and international 
laws and standards, with a focus on workers’ rights and their impact 
on business operations. At the closing workshop in November there 
was no doubt that both these objectives had been met, at least in 
the shorter term. The most enthusiastic group were factory workers 
who now felt more like a part of the success or failure of the com -
pany with greater understanding both of their responsibilities and 
rights. However as the project only lasted less than a year, it is still 
too early to evaluate any long-term effects. It is unclear whether the 
local stakeholders feel sufficient ownership to continue the process 
that has been started. As a learning exercise the project has in any 
case already been a success, as there are plenty of positive experi -
ences to build on for future projects.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   30
Education of garment workers in Bangladesh
One of H&M’s CSR objectives is to increase the awareness among 
garment workers about their rights. During 2004, we have taken 
some initiatives in this direction. The project in Bulgaria described 
above is an example. Another is a project with a local women’s 
rights-NGO in Bangladesh. Together with this organisation we have 
developed an education programme for, primarily female, workers 
focusing on labour rights, women’s rights, maternity leave and gen -
der issues. Educational material (four leaflets and a video) have been 
developed, and the first groups of workers have been educated in 
three factories supplying to H&M. Each group of 20-25 workers edu -
cated at a time, are provided with four to five sets of leaflets each 
that they can then use to educate co-workers, thereby spreading 
the knowledge to their peers. The leaflets cover areas like working 
hours, wages, leave, occupational health and safety, and maternity 
benefits. It is our ambition to educate around 20 per cent of the 
workers in each factory with direct education.The staff resources of the local NGO are limited, but we hope to 
be able to cover three to four factories per year with this educa -
tion, reaching about 400 workers directly, and 2,000 indirectly. The 
project started in August 2004 and by the end of the year we had 
reached 96 workers in three factories directly, and 400-500 indirectly. 
Additional groups in two of these factories will be trained in 2005, 
and depending on the capacity of the NGO we hope to expand the 
training to two to four additional factories in 2005.
One challenge has been that one of the initial two factories 
dropped out after the first two days of training. No follow-up training 
was performed in this factory. Instead the factory has undertaken 
to arrange similar training for the workers in cooperation with the 
ILO. H&M has asked to be closely involved as an observer to ensure 
the quality of the training. At the same time, another participating 
factory has been so enthusiastic about the training that they have 
asked H&M to arrange training in their other factory.  ■CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   31
H&M and UNICEF work together 
During 2004, H&M signed a three-year cooperation agreement  
with the world’s largest children’s rights organisation, UNICEF  
(www.unicef.or g). Since H&M is a multinational corporation with 
shops in 20 countries, we chose a global organisation that is well 
known and respected in both our sales and production countries. 
The partnership involves a donation from H&M totalling USD 
500,000 per year for three years towards two of UNICEF’s top priority 
projects; Girls’ Education, and Maintaining HIV Prevention among 
Youth in Cambodia. 
The Girls’ Education project aims at raising the level of education 
for girls in developing countries. Education is the first step towards 
equality between men and women, and can help girls and women 
around the world to improve their living conditions. Supporting 
the development of girls and women is relevant to H&M, not least 
because the majority of the company’s customers and staff are 
women. 
The Maintaining HIV Prevention Among Youth in Cambodia project 
will provide the local community with information on how to protect 
themselves from HIV and AIDS. A call centre will be set up, and 
teachers will receive information in order to be able to educate their 
students. The project directly addresses workers in ten factories 
contracted by H&M. Charity initiatives 
Every year our sales organisations are engaged in various charity 
projects. Here are some examples from 2004.
■ H&M Great Britain and H&M Norway have supported the Pink  
 Ribbon breast cancer awareness campaign. H&M had pink  
 ribbons in all UK shops for customers and staff to wear.   
 Customers donated GBP 1 or more for each ribbon.
■ H&M France supports the Secours populaire, a French non-profit  
 organisation that aids children and disadvantaged families. 
■ H&M USA donated USD 10,000 as part of a USD 25,000 one  
 year commitment to Childhood, USA, the US chapter of the  
 World Childhood Foundation. The contribution will be used to  
 support a home for pregnant teens in New York City. 
H&M donates clothes
H&M continues to donate clothes to victims of war and natural 
catastrophes and other people in need. H&M’s efforts at improv -
ing quality have resulted in a number of orders being held back 
from sale in recent years. Clothes that do not meet H&M’s quality 
standards are not passed on to the shops. We have signed an 
agreement with a reputable aid organisation in each sales country 
and large quantities of new clothes have been sent to those in need 
through these organisations in recent years. Some of the organisa -
tions that we work with are UNHCR, Oxfam, Caritas, Deutsche 
Malteser, Red Cross, and Terre des hommes. Naturally, we never 
give away clothes that do not pass our safety or chemical require -
ments. Such garments are destroyed. ■COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT

Our quality work
Quality is an integral part of H&M’s business concept. Our ambition 
is to make sure that all customers always are both safe and satisfied 
regarding the quality of all our goods. Our customers’ expectations 
lead our work.  
To fulfil this ambition, our quality work is controlled through our 
production offices and their local quality organisation that consists 
of laboratory technicians and quality inspectors. There are laborato -
ries that work according to H&M standardised working methods in 
most production offices. The quality department at the Stockholm 
buying office supports the production offices in quality related 
issues. To ensure the quality of all products at the production stage, 
there are more than 100 quality controllers employed in the produc -
tion offices. They regularly visit factories in order to control and 
correct any quality problems in the course of production. In most 
cases, our quality controllers also carry out a final inspection before 
the goods are shipped. H&M uses the AQL 2.51 system to decide 
whether the quality level is acceptable for shipment.PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY
OUR QUALITY DEPARTMENT IS ORGANISED  
WITHIN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: 
QUALITY STANDARDS AND TESTING
This section focuses on developing and implementing requirements for 
our physical and chemical tests in accordance with the safety require -
ments of the sales country with the strictest regulations.
TECHNICAL  
This section centres its attention on issues related to fit, sizes, and 
technical making of garments. H&M participates in a body measure -
ment study and a size project that will lead to a common size system in 
Europe. 
PRODUCT CONTROL 
This section is concerned with issues such as consumer product safety 
and children’s safety. Much attention is also centred on the implementa -
tion of a guideline for production and quality control with our suppliers.1 Acceptable quality level refers 
to the maximum percentage 
of defectives (in this case 2.5 
per cent) that, for the purpose 
of sampling inspection, can be 
considered satisfactory as a  
process average.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   33
Controlling quality
H&M requires that each factory has a quality control system. The so 
called GPQ system (Guidelines for Production and Quality Control), 
is coordinated with the system H&M’s quality controllers use when 
monitoring production. The main purpose is to detect and correct 
any quality problems as early as possible in the production process. 
The goods are controlled at several stages during production inclu-
ding the packing stage.Samples of every product in H&M’s collections undergo a number 
of quality and safety tests. Each year, hundreds of thousands of 
tests are carried out, mainly at our production office and sales 
country laboratories, but also at external laboratories. Garments are 
washed and measured to check that they do not shrink or twist, and 
to check their colourfastness and dry rubbing. In addition, we test 
salt and chlorine bleaching, pilling and seam strength. Durability 
tests are carried out on details such as zippers and press-buttons. 
Flammability tests are performed to check that the garments are not 
flammable. Random quality control takes place at our distribution 
centres before the garments are distributed to the shops. 
Children’s safety
Children’s clothes must meet particularly high safety requirements.  
It is our constant goal to design and manufacture baby and chil -
dren’s wear with safety in mind. H&M always follows the safety 
requirements of the sales country with the strictest regulations. 
At every production office there is a person responsible for chil -
dren’s safety. The majority of our designers, buyers, and production 
office staff have received training on children’s safety. New employ -
ees are trained as well. All baby and children’s wear suppliers are 
required to sign H&M’s Safety Requirements for Baby and Children’s 
wear. In so doing, they undertake to follow our requirements and 
policies on e.g. button and accessory testing machines, broken 
needles, and needle detection machines. Each supplier must also 
have a person that has been educated and updated on children’s 
safety by H&M staff. HOW GARMENTS ARE QUALITY CONTROLLED
In order to ensure that garments are of high quality, H&M quality 
controllers visit suppliers during production.
START-UP MEETING
We meet the supplier prior to production to examine the garment 
in order to identify any technical difficulties that might occur.
INSPECTION
Our controllers carry out inspections as early as possible during 
production in order to avoid mistakes. These inspections include 
checking measurements. The controllers have a size chart to help 
them and the suppliers must have a sample against which they 
can compare their products to make sure that they are exactly 
what H&M has ordered. The quality controllers can carry out  
several different inspections during production. 
FINAL INSPECTION
During the final inspection, the controllers check to see if the  
garments have been well sewn, well pressed, and are produced 
according to the approved sample and other requirements.  
They also check price tags, labels, and sizes. CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   34
Furthermore, at the request of SIS1, H&M participates in the work to 
establish safety standards for baby and children’s garments. This 
work is organized by CEN2. 
■ H&M designs baby and children’s wear with safety in mind.  
 For instance, we pay attention to hoods and drawstrings in  
 order to avoid situations where the construction of the garment  
 increases the risk of entrapment or suffocation. All sewn on  
 buttons, press buttons, ribbons, etc. are tested according to  
 EN 71-13 and BS 7907:19974. 
■ H&M tries to avoid too many details and decorations on baby  
 and children’s garments to prevent them from being a safety risk.
■ Before baby and children’s garments are packed and exported,  
 they are run through a needle detector, which detects any small  
 fragments of metal. 
H&M reserves the right to cancel an order or, if it has already been 
delivered, return the goods if any of the conditions in H&M’s   
safety requirements for children’s and baby wear are not met. 
Chemical restrictions 
Out of concern for the health of our customers, as well as for the 
environment and the working conditions in the factories where our 
products are made, H&M has established chemical restrictions for 
textile, leather, plastic and metal products. These are chemicals 
that are, or could potentially be, harmful for health and environment. 
Particular consideration is given to substances that could cause 
skin irritation or allergies or that may be carcinogenic. The precautionary principle guides our work with chemical restric -
tions. Thus, the restrictions include both chemicals restricted by law, 
and chemicals that we have chosen to include for precautionary 
reasons. As an important part of H&M’s long-term work against 
allergies, we participate in projects aimed at establishing reliable 
standards for testing allergenic substances. 
We require that all suppliers comply with our chemical restrictions. 
To this end, all our suppliers must sign the Chemical Restrictions 
Compliance Commitment and/or Restrictions for Cosmetic and 
Hygiene Products. We support our suppliers with information on 
how to implement and comply with our chemical restrictions. Our 
suppliers also receive information on how to locate and resolve 
problems if they infringe our restrictions. In this way we contribute 
to reducing the environmental impact in the production process, as 
well as in the incineration and recycling of worn-out clothing.
We perform tests in order to check that banned chemicals are not 
present in the garments. Nickel, AZO dyes, disperse dyes, formalde -
hyde, and phthalates are examples of substances that are routinely 
tested. Approximately 20,000 chemical related tests were performed 
during 2004. In addition, jewellery and metal details are tested for 
nickel release. Tests are made on products where the risk of detect -
ing breaches to our chemical restrictions is higher. This means that 
products that are made of particular materials, or that are manufac -
tured by suppliers with poor track records are selected for testing. 
For example, products with certain colours are more likely to contain 
banned AZO dyes, which are prohibited by H&M. Our chemical 
restrictions are continuously updated, with new substances being 
added on a regular basis. The chemicals currently included in our 
chemical restrictions can be found under a drop down menu at

In order to stay ahead, a close cooperation and dialogue with 
relevant authorities is also crucial. Our cooperation and sharing of 
information with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission 
(CPSC), the National Chemicals Inspectorate in Sweden, the 
Swedish Consumer Agency, and other similar organisations have 
helped us become a leader in the field.
Our product policies
■ H&M only sells fur and leather from sheep, pigs, goats and cattle  
 that have been bred for meat production, not just for the sake  
 of the skin. No other fur or leather is permitted in products sold  
 by H&M.
■ H&M’s children’s clothing must be comfortable and practical.  
 We do not make children’s clothes that may be perceived as  
 provocative. 
■ H&M has decided not to use camoufluage patterns on garments. 
■ Prints on tops and other garments must not be offensive, racist,  
 sexist, political or religious.
■ For products made of tropical wood H&M requires a certificate  
 from FSC1. 
■ H&M’s suppliers must guarantee that material used for H&M’s  
 products does not contain endangered species in any form.
■ Since autumn 2002, in accordance with American legislation, all  
 garments are labelled with country of origin information. REACH – PROPOSAL FOR A NEW CHEMICAL  
LEGISLATION WITHIN THE EU
Chemicals are used in the manufacturing processes for almost every 
product, and as ingredients in the articles themselves. However, the 
information on what harm these chemicals do to our health and the 
environment is insufficient. Companies that are dependent on che -
micals for their products are presently unable to obtain or demand 
the information they need. Still, they cannot afford not to have such 
information. To tackle this deficiency, a new set of EU legislation is 
taking shape. The existing patchwork of different chemicals laws will 
be replaced by one single piece of legislation for the registration, eva -
luation, and authorisation of chemicals (REACH).
H&M strives to gain the long-term confidence of customers, 
employees and other interest groups by avoiding hazardous sub -
stances. We have already phased out brominated flame retardants, 
organotin compounds, phthalates and PVC from our clothing lines in 
favour of substitutes. 
REACH will lead to internationally harmonised and authorised cri -
teria for Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC). This will obviously 
assist us in selecting substances for substitution, very much the same 
way as our chemical restriction list process. H&M has adopted the 
precautionary principle, and that means we have to be proactive and 
solve the problems upstream. The most cost-effective and the only 
adequate control measure should be substitution – not to continue to 
use hazardous chemicals. 
A strong REACH will benefit H&M’s business by minimising our 
business risks and by reducing our costs for ensuring that all pro -
ducts we offer our customers are free from substances that are, or 
could potentially be, harmful for health and environment. 1 Forest Stewardship Council

Animal testing 
H&M does not allow animal testing on cosmetic and hygiene prod -
ucts, either during production or on the finished products. All the 
ingredients used in H&M’s products are approved in accordance 
with the high requirements set by the authorities and H&M. Products 
are always assessed for their safety and quality. 
H&M has had a policy on animal testing since the mid-1990s. This 
policy forms part of H&M’s restrictions for cosmetic and hygiene 
products. All suppliers of H&M’s own cosmetic and hygiene prod -
ucts undertake to abide by these restrictions. Finally, suppliers have 
a duty to inform their subcontractors of H&M’s restrictions, and 
ensure that they abide by them. 
Recall management
In spite of well organised quality work, occasionally garments that 
do not live up to our standards reach our shops. In such cases, our 
recall management system ensures fast and professional recall of a 
particular item. Recalled items are listed on www.hm.com/cs r. ■
 FOLLOWING LEGISLATION THROUGH ECO-TRACK
Our concerns about the impact of certain substances on the environ -
ment and on human health require us to keep abreast of the stringent 
legislation that exists in many of our sales countries. ECO-TRACK 
provides valuable and up-to-date information on relevant legislation 
– existing and forthcoming – that may affect our products.

All H&M’s communication aims at building the H&M brand in the 
long term. The way in which we communicate with the world around 
influences our credibility. Both internal and external communication 
must therefore be characterised by an open attitude with clear mes -
sages, objectivity, accessibility and awareness. 
H&M communicates and conveys the brand via a number of dif -
ferent channels. The main forum for communication is via our shops. 
Our methods of communicating include advertising in magazines, 
on television, billboards, and the internet. Our advertisements are 
largely identical in all our markets, but the media mix is adapted 
to local needs and conditions. Commercial images are a matter of 
taste, and it is extremely difficult to satisfy different preferences. 
Through customer surveys in all our markets, we know that the vast 
majority of our customers appreciate our marketing and that it cre -
ates positive brand values. 
H&M’s fashion models
Fashion changes continuously and our campaigns strive to follow 
the different trends. This means that different campaigns require 
the use of different fashion models. However, when trends move 
towards unhealthiness, we actively choose not to follow them in our 
communication.
Our models are chosen in cooperation with internationally recog -
nised agencies. The models portrayed in our advertisements should 
be healthy and wholesome. H&M actively chooses not to work with 
models who are too young or too thin, or models suffering from 
eating disorders or drug or alcohol abuse. Representatives from 
H&M are always present at commercial photo shoots to ensure that 
H&M’s demands are met. COMMUNICATIONS  
AND MARKETING
H&M’S ADVERTISING POLICY
H&M communicates its business concept – fashion and quality at the 
best price – through various advertising campaigns each year through-
out Europe and North America. The campaigns are designed to be 
clear and simple and aim to inform our customers of what is new at 
H&M and to show who we are and what we stand for. We show the 
latest fashion and the price of the goods.
Advertising is produced centrally in Sweden by H&M’s marketing 
department in cooperation with various creative professionals. The 
advertisements are largely identical in all H&M’s markets, but the 
media mix is adapted to local requirements and conditions. 
Our marketing has a major impact. It is therefore essential for us to 
convey a positive and healthy image. H&M’s advertising images do not 
aim to communicate a specific ideal. We use different characters and a 
mix of different looks and styles to advertise our various concepts for 
women, men, teenagers, and children. 
The people we show in our advertising must be healthy and who -
lesome. H&M deliberately distances itself from drug and alcohol 
abuse. The models are chosen in cooperation between internationally 
recognised agencies and our own representatives. The reason why we 
use professional models is that they are used to being in front of the 
camera and can give a true impression of our clothes. By working with 
professional models, photographers and stylists we can communicate 
our fashion and quality in a clear and inspirational way. 
We have special guidelines for the advertising of our children’s con -
cepts. Our target group is parents, not children. This means that we 
place advertisements in media that is not aimed directly at children. As 
far as children who take part in our campaigns are concerned, we are 
satisfied that they take part of their own free will. Whenever children 
are involved in a photo shoot there is always a representative of H&M 
present to ensure professionalism and the safety of the children. We 
market clothes for both boys and girls of different ages. By using 
children from different cultures we highlight the diversity of society.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   38
Handling feedback 
H&M welcomes constructive feedback. The feedback that we 
receive from customers and other stakeholders is generally very 
positive. However, we do get negative comments and, occasionally, 
H&M’s campaigns are reported to ethics councils. 
In 2004, H&M used wall drapings to advertise a bikini bottom. This 
particular advertisement was part of our bathing suit campaign that 
was communicated through a broad range of media channels in our 
sales countries. The image was cut, and showed the bikini and the 
model’s hands from behind. The wall draping that was placed on a 
building in Stockholm was reported to the Ethics Council against 
Sex Discrimination in Advertising in Sweden. No advertisement used 
in the 2004 bathing suit campaign was reported in any H&M sales 
country other than Sweden. 
We have learned from the criticism that ERK has put forward. We 
realize that aspects other than just the creative content of an image 
matter. More precisely, we will make sure we consider factors such 
as format, placing and context to a greater extent than we have up 
to now.  ■One of the basic principles of the International 
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) International 
Code of Advertising Practice is that commer -
cial communication should be designed with 
an appropriate sense of social responsibility. 
According to Article 4, item 1 of the Code, 
advertisements should not condone any form of 
discrimination, including that based on sex.
The Ethics Council has expressed an opinion 
on a number of occasions in the past about 
H&M’s undergarment campaigns. In 101-110/93 
among others, the Council stated the following: 
“Naturally, H&M must have the right to present 
the undergarments sold in its shops on live 
models. What the Council must consider is 
where to draw the line between presenting the 
undergarments in a sensual manner and using 
the model wearing the undergarments as a sex -
ual eye-catcher in a way that can be perceived 
as insulting to women. When scrutinising H&M’s 
outdoor campaign, it is important to take into 
consideration the fact that different age groups 
are affected in different ways by these types 
of images and that images on large billboards 
outdoors have a far greater impact than, for 
example, pictures in a newspaper. Also, adverti -
sing reflects a society’s values.”
The Council found that the campaign in 
question could not be considered as discrimi -
nating on the basis of sex. 
As in other similar cases, the Council 
recognized that it is important for advertisers 
who offer undergarments and other similar 
products for sale to have considerable free -
dom to present the clothes on living models 
in advertisements. The campaign that is cur -
rently in question is, however, different from 
past campaigns in that it would seem that the 
images have been dramatically cut for the purpose of focusing exclusively on a very small 
part of the woman’s body, namely her bottom 
and the bikini bottom she is wearing. With 
this type of focus, which is further reinforced 
because the size of the image makes it even 
more striking, the woman’s body, or part of the 
body, is reduced to an object. The image is 
thereby objectified more than would otherwise 
be the case, and more than has been the case 
in past H&M undergarment campaigns. The 
Council therefore finds in an overall assess -
ment that the objectification is so pronounced 
that the advertisement goes beyond what is 
considered justified to market the product and 
exceeds the necessary freedom for marketing 
undergarments/bathing suits. Accordingly, in 
the Council’s opinion, the outdoor campaign 
in question is insulting to women in general. It 
is therefore in violation of the ICC International 
Code of Advertising Practice. 
H&M’s response
Hennes & Mauritz has issued a statement 
which briefly puts forward the following: “The 
purpose of our campaigns is to present our 
latest fashions. The images used in the ad 
campaign should illustrate current trends and 
inform our customers about our range in an 
inspiring way. Our intention is not to present an 
ideal, but rather to find models that can repre -
sent our trends. The bathing suit campaign is 
one of several that we have presented during 
the year. The theme for this year’s bathing suit 
campaign was “the joy of the beach” and it was 
photographed using Brazilian models. We do 
not find it unnatural to show a picture of just a 
bikini bottom. We want our campaigns to touch 
people, not upset them.”STATEMENT FROM NÄRINGSLIVETS ETISKA RÅD MOT

CODE OF CONDUCT MANAGEMENT
Objectives for the Code of Conduct work 
When setting our yearly targets, we make sure that they lead to the 
long-term objectives described below. Each objective expresses an 
ideal condition that guides our efforts.
  CODE OF CONDUCT OBJECTIVES
■ Full Code of Conduct Compliance by all suppliers  
 and their subcontractors.
■ Code of Conduct completely integrated with our  
 business operations.  
 The importance of Code of Conduct issues should  
 be reflected in everyday decisions as well as in strategic  
 decisions. 
■ Factory workers empowered to claim their rights.  
 The factory workers should be informed about labour  
 laws and human rights according to national and  
 international legislation. Their efforts in improving their  
 working conditions should be supported. 
■ Code of Conduct compliance maintained through  
 effective management systems.  
 Tools and procedures should be developed in  
 cooperation with the supplier.  
■ Knowledge among our stakeholders about our  
 corporate social responsibility efforts.   
 The information or education given should be adapted  
 to the various stakeholder groups.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   42
CSR organisation
H&M has more than 30 Code of Conduct auditors that audit our 
suppliers’ operations. The auditors work at H&M’s production 
offices, where we also have more than 100 quality controllers who 
report any infringements of the Code of Conduct that they find. 
Audit results are reported to the local H&M office as well as to the 
CSR department in Stockholm. The CSR department is a corporate 
level department. Its manager reports directly to the managing 
director.  ■

In discussions with our stakeholders we have noticed an interest 
in understanding the reality that we face in different countries of 
production. This section is aimed at providing our readers with 
some insight into the dilemmas that we are struggling with. It is to 
be noted that the following text is not a fully comprehensive account. 
Rather, it gives some examples of the complexity of the issues cov -
ered by our Code of Conduct, and the challenges that we deal with. 
Legal Requirements
The Code states: 
Our general rule is that all our suppliers must, in all their activities, 
follow the national laws in the countries where they are operating. 
Should any of the following requirements by H&M be in violation of 
the national law in any country or territory, the law should always 
be followed. In such a case, the supplier must always inform H&M 
immediately upon receiving this Code. It is however important to 
understand that H&M’s requirements may not be limited to the 
requirements of the national law.
Auditing dilemma
In some countries it is extremely difficult to understand what is 
prescribed by law. The reason for this is often regional and local 
deviances from national regulations. It can be due to differences in 
interpretation or implementation. It is difficult to audit compliance 
with a law that is subject to interpretation, and that is not effectively 
enforced by local authorities. In some cases the laws are also obso -
lete, and do not always apply to the garment industry. Addressing the issue
We have consulted local governments and local legal experts in 
many countries for guidance on how to interpret various laws. We 
still struggle for example with calculation of overtime compensation 
for workers being paid by piece, in countries where the law does not 
specify how this compensation should be calculated.
Child labour 
The Code states: 
■ We base our policy on child labour on the UN Convention on  
 The Rights of the Child, article 32.1. 
■ We recognise the rights of every child to be protected from  
 economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely  
 to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be  
 harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral  
 or social development.
■ We define, in this context, the work “child” as a person younger  
 than 15 years of age or, as an exception, 14 years in countries  
 covered by article 2.4 in the ILO convention No. 138. 
■ We are concerned about the situation of children in many parts  
 of the world. We acknowledge the fact that child labour does  
 exist and cannot be eradicated with rules or inspections, as long  
 as the children’s social situation is not improved. We want to  
 actively work with factories and with NGOs in third world  
 countries, to try to improve the situation for the children affected  
 by our ban on child labour.ADDRESSING COMPLIANCE ISSUESCSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   44
Auditing dilemma  
Child labour is very uncommon in export garment manufaturing; 
only a handful cases are detected yearly. However, child labour can 
sometimes be difficult to detect since neither the child nor the fac -
tory manager want to be exposed. Child labour can normally only 
be found through unannounced visits. In most countries a person is 
allowed to work at the age of 15 (16 in China). To visually decide the 
exact age of a teenager can be difficult. In some countries ID-cards 
are not available. In such cases we need other age certificates or 
a physician’s statement. Moreover, children can become scared 
when their age is questioned. They might panic and disappear or 
be immediately dismissed by the management. This is why auditors 
make sure they immediately note down the name and contact infor -
mation of the child and its parents so that H&M can always trace the 
child for follow-up action. 
Addressing the issue
As we absolutely do not accept child labour we are always looking 
out for the slightest sign of anyone being too young to work. Does 
anyone look young? Does anyone seem frightened? Is anyone 
hiding? Is there a workstation that looks as if someone just left it in 
a hurry? During document review we go over age certificates and 
check dates of birth. However, we still need to ensure that checking 
the age becomes a standard routine when recruiting new workers. 
Security guards are instructed not to let anyone inside who is under 
legal working age. We do not even allow children to go to factories 
in order to visit their parents since we cannot feel confident they do 
not work. 
Nevertheless, if a child is found working at one of our suppliers’ 
factories we make an arrangement with the child’s family to find the 
best solution for the child. In most cases this means some type of 
education. A family can become dependent on a child’s income. H&M demands 
that the supplier, which has violated the law and H&M’s Code, pays 
both for school and maintained salary until the child reaches legal 
working age. H&M stays in contact with the supplier, the family, and 
the school to make sure that the child continues his or her educa -
tion. If there is no follow-up, the child may leave school and take up 
another job, seeking to earn double income. 
If a supplier continues to use child workers, we see no other 
option but to permanently terminate business with that supplier. 
Worker’s basic rights 
The Code states:
■ We do not accept the use of bonded workers, prisoners or illegal  
 workers in the production of goods for H&M.
■ If foreign workers are employed on a contract basis, they should  
 never be required to remain employed for any period of time  
 against their own will. All commissions and other fees to the  
 recruitment agency in connection with their employment should  
 be covered by the employer.
■ Under no circumstances do we accept that our suppliers or their  
 subcontractors use corporal punishment or other forms of mental  
 or physical disciplinary actions, or engage in sexual harassment.
■ All workers should be free to join associations of their own   
 choosing, and they should have the right to bargain collectively.  
 We do not accept any disciplinary actions from the factory   
 against workers who choose to peacefully and lawfully organise  
 or join an association.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   45
VIOLATION OF FREEDOM OF  
ASSOCIATION IN BANGLADESH 
We frequently get questions about how H&M can uphold the 
demand for freedom of association in our Code of Conduct. The 
best way to demonstrate this would be a real example of how we 
act when a violation is reported to us.
On December 14 2004 we got a call to our office in Dhaka from 
a Bangladeshi trade union, informing us about one of our suppliers 
where around 30 workers had been dismissed after an incident in 
the factory. We immediately started to investigate the case through 
meetings with workers, management and the union. After some 
research we came to the conclusion that the allegations were true. 
After consultations with international NGOs and trade unions we 
shared our findings with other buyers in that factory in question. We 
also initiated a meeting with the factory management and the gar -
ment exporters’ association in Bangladesh informing them about the 
violation and asking for assistance. 
To our satisfaction the joint action by buyers and local and inter -
national stakeholders led to a constructive dialogue between the 
local union and the factory management. On February 24, 2005 an 
agreement was made, granting the workers an offer of reemploy -
ment. The local union confirmed to us that they were satisfied with 
the agreement and encouraged us to resume business with the 
factory.Auditing dilemma
The problem with violations of workers’ human rights is that they are 
difficult to detect using ordinary monitoring methods. Frequently, the 
evidence is ambiguous. For instance in the case of forced labour, 
workers’ passports may be kept by the supplier with the argument 
that the documents are protected from theft. Another example is a 
supplier giving a worker an advance payment which could be seen 
as a generous gesture. But the worker cannot leave until he has 
worked long enough to pay back the debt which can again be con -
sidered forced or bonded labour. Violations that would never happen 
when one of our auditors is present, such as verbal abuse, corporal 
punishment or sexual harassment are obviously also very difficult to 
detect. 
To decide whether workers have full freedom to organise is also 
impossible to determine during factory audits. In some production 
countries, there are indications that only a very small share of the 
workforce is organised in trade unions. There are several possible 
reasons for this. In some countries, industrial relations do not func -
tion properly. The number of players is substantial; at times some 
twenty or thirty trade unions may seek to recruit members in the 
same industry sector. Further, employers may not accept trade 
unions and try to prevent workers from organising. Finally, in some 
countries workers may not know what a trade union is or how it 
works, and subsequently they do not demand to join one. 
In these cases, the only way of detecting violations is to interview 
workers. However even this method has its limitations. For fear of 
punishment workers may not always trust our auditors and do not 
dare to tell the truth. Particularly in cases of violation of freedom of 
association, we tend to receive information from trade unions rather 
than directly from the factory workers. But we also see an increasing 
number of human rights violations being reported directly to our 
auditors by factory workers.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   46
Addressing the issue
Any violation against the ILO’s Core Conventions is considered to 
be such a severe violation that the production unit in question is 
graded ‘rejected’ for H&M production until the problems have been 
solved. Normally these issues cannot be solved by simply pointing 
out to management that a violation has been detected. In many 
cases, top or middle management is involved in these practices, or 
approves of them in one way or another. The solution must therefore 
involve education and influencing attitudes. Frequently, a joint action 
from several buying companies is necessary to put pressure on the 
management to take the issue seriously. A few suspected cases 
of dismissal of union members have occurred during the year in 
Bangladesh, Indonesia and Turkey. If our investigations show that 
workers have been dismissed due to union activity it is a clear viola -
tion of our demand for freedom of association and in those cases 
we have asked that the dismissed workers should be reinstated. 
H&M has in every such case actively been involved in discussions 
between unions, suppliers and other stakeholders to reach an 
acceptable solution.
Wages and working hours 
The Code states:
■ Wages should be paid regularly, on time and be fair in respect  
 of work performance. The legal minimum wages should be a  
 minimum, but not a recommended, level. 
■ Weekly working time must not exceed the legal limit, and  
 overtime work should always be voluntary and properly  
 compensated. 
■ The workers should be granted their stipulated annual leave  
 and sick leave without any form of repercussions.Auditing dilemma
In order to check wages and working hours we examine various 
documents in the factories. Double record-keeping (pay slips, sal -
ary records, time cards, log books etc.) is a common violation. The 
intent is to mislead auditors and/or local authorities. The main 
reason for faking documents is to hide illegal overtime, and avoid 
paying correct compensation. By comparing production records, 
time cards, salary records, pay slips, and other documents, our 
auditors often detect double record-keeping. The records can also 
be validated through worker interviews.
Addressing the issue 
In some cases, we have had to advise our suppliers to introduce 
meaningful reporting systems. For example, we have made sug -
gestions on how payroll reporting could be organised, with columns 
for hours worked, overtime hours, and for any bonuses or deduc -
tions, so that it would be clear how the final pay is calculated. Only 
once the reporting systems had been introduced we were able to 
effectively check that the factory workers were getting the wages to 
which they were entitled.
Due to rigorous checking of documents such as salary records, 
time cards, and payslips we can be quite sure that all workers 
receive at least the legal minimum wage based on regular working 
hours. We can also verify whether overtime work is compensated 
fully. Excessive overtime and failure to pay correct overtime com -
pensation are still fairly common violations detected during factory 
audits. Improved planning, increased productivity, better human 
resource management, improved quality insurance, better dialogue 
between workers and management are all measures that can reduce 
violations regarding working hours and wages. H&M has run several 
projects aimed at addressing these problems. The overtime project 
in China described in last year’s report is one such project.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   47
Safety
The Code states:
■ We require from our suppliers that the workers’ safety should  
 be a priority at all times. No hazardous equipment or unsafe  
 buildings are accepted.
Auditing dilemma
Many production units have, as a result of our work, installed fire 
exits, fire alarms, fire extinguishers etc. However, the procedures to 
maintain good safety levels are lacking. Personal protective equip -
ment required by us is usually available, but frequently it is not used 
since the workers have not been sufficiently educated about the 
purpose of the protection. Occasionally factories share buildings 
with other companies. It can then be difficult to maintain overall 
safety in the building. 
Addressing the issue
Our focus is gradually changing from merely pointing out safety 
issues to involving our suppliers in discussions about policies and 
routines. There must be dedicated staff appointed with responsibility 
for safety standards in the factories. As in many other areas, educa -
tion is a key to sustained improvements. For example, there is little 
point asking for fire extinguishers to be installed if none of the work -
ers understand what they are and how to operate them. Another 
example is that many machines are delivered with safety devices 
that mechanics, ignorant of the consequences, permanently remove 
because they hinder maintenance. Factory conditions
The Code states:
■ It is important for the workers’ well-being, and for the quality of  
 the garments, that the factory environment is clean and free from  
 pollution of different kinds. 
■ The temperature in the factory should be tolerable as a working  
 environment, and the ventilation should be adequate. Heaters or  
 fans should be provided when needed. 
■ The lighting in each workplace should be sufficient for the work  
 performed, at all times of day. 
■ Sanitary facilities should be clean, and the workers should have  
 access without unreasonable restrictions. The number of  
 facilities should be adequate for the number of workers in the  
 factory. Sanitary facilities should be available on each floor,  
 and preferably separated for men and women.
Auditing dilemma
It is difficult to develop universal criteria for what is acceptable 
and what is not in terms of working environment. We have seen 
examples where other buyers have requested that suppliers provide 
tables and chairs in the canteen in countries where people normally 
sit on the floor, or install air-conditioning even though many workers 
do not appreciate it. Good knowledge of local conditions is essential 
in order not to waste the factories’ resources on improvements that 
do not necessarily benefit workers. What may be considered far 
too hot in one country is acceptable or even desirable in another. 
Common sense has to be used and one has to be sensitive to cul -
tural differences.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   48
Another common problem in this area is the lack of policies and 
procedures to maintain improvements already achieved. We can 
however note during worker interviews that complaints about the 
working environment are fairly uncommon. 
The most serious violation related to factory conditions is when 
workers are not allowed to use the bathrooms as frequently as they 
want to, in order not to interrupt the production. This can cause seri -
ous health problems for the workers and is not allowed. It can be dif -
ficult to detect such violations other than through worker interviews.
Addressing the issue
Compared to most other issues, factory conditions in terms of work -
ing environment and cleanliness are fairly easy to address. We rarely 
find cases where factories do not make improvements in lighting, 
temperature, cleanliness and so on when requested. Many factories 
have a doctor or nurse available during working hours who can treat 
minor injuries and common discomforts such as headaches or upset 
stomachs. However, the challenge lies in upholding cleaning and 
maintenance routines. This is an ongoing process, not least when 
we start buying from a new supplier. 
Environment
The Code states:
■ Our suppliers must comply with all applicable environmental  
 laws and regulations in the country of operation. 
■ According to the H&M Chemical Restrictions, we do not allow  
 use of solvents or other hazardous chemicals in the production  
 of our garments. All suppliers must sign the H&M Chemical   
 Restriction Commitment, confirming that no prohibited chemical  
 substances will be used in the production.Auditing dilemma
Awareness about environmental hazards is generally low in many 
countries where H&M’s garments are produced. Legislation is also 
weak in many areas and govermental environmental programmes 
and services ore often lacking. Even though we are able to identify 
various types of hazardous waste generated in the factory, the coun -
try or region may lack the facitlites to handle waste in an appropriate 
way. This leads to complications in terms of what corrective actions 
we can actually demand. We also demand that material safety data 
sheets for all chemicals handled in the factory should be available, 
but frequently these cannot be obtained from local dealers and do 
not exist in local languages. Chemical containers are often inad -
equately labelled and it is hard to check the exact content.
Addressing the issue
By asking questions about required permits and by physically 
inspecting factory premises, H&M can identify potential violations 
of the local environmental laws. We focus mainly on chemicals, 
emissions to water and air, and hazardous waste. When local law 
is vague or suitable facilities for waste disposal do not exist we do 
what we can in that particular situation. This means that although 
we may not be able to find a perfect solution, we try to make some 
improvements. At the very least, we give our suppliers advice to 
help them limit envionmental risks. We can also make sure that 
chemicals are handled and stored in a way that is safe for the work -
ers, and avoid spillages and leaks that can cause pollution or health 
hazards. We also check that necessary personal protective equip -
ment is available, although it is hard to monitor whether it is always 
used. CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   49
Code of Conduct inspection procedures 
In order to reach our Code of Conduct objectives, and consequently 
gain trust from our stakeholders, we need systems and procedures 
that are efficient and credible. Below, we give an account of how 
inspections have been performed. With the introduction of the full 
audit programme in 2005, the way we do audits (inspections) will 
change. Read more about the full audit programme on page 25.
Auditors’ tools
■ Supplier evalutation form and guidelines – The supplier  
 evaluation form is the basis of every inspection. It contains more  
 than 100 questions that correlate to our Code of Conduct. The  
 inspector uses the guidelines for support. 
■ Overtime audit form and guidelines – A template for conducting  
 overtime audits. The guidelines support the inspector when   
 making overtime audits. Advice is given on where overtime is  
 most frequently discovered, how many workers should be  
 sampled, how to cross-check information etc.
■ Child labour guidelines – To help the inspector to handle  
 suspected child labour situations. Measures taken aim at  
 securing the child’s best interest. 
■ Violation guideline – To guide the inspector when severe  
 violations occur.
■ Rating system guideline – The guideline outlines what  
 requirements that need to be fulfilled to earn a certain grade.■ Worker interview guideline – Provides support on how to conduct  
 interviews with factory workers. The enclosed questionnaire  
 covers issues such as fire safety, working hours, wages, working  
 environment, freedom of association, discrimination, child labour,  
 and forced labour. The guidelines also give information on how to  
 file reports and take action.
Prior to auditing
■ Compliance commitment – The supplier is required to sign a  
 Code of Conduct compliance commitment contract before the  
 first inspection. This commitment covers the supplier’s own  
 production unit as well as any subcontractors’ units. 
The audit
■ Management interview – The management is interviewed about  
 issues such as relevant management practices, salaries, working  
 hours and freedom of association. 
■ Document review – Documentation to verify working hours,   
 wages and overtime compensation is checked. Staff records and  
 age certificates are checked.
■ Factory inspection – The factory is inspected to evaluate working  
 conditions, safety and environmental aspects. 
■ Closing meeting – The inspection results are discussed with the  
 supplier, as well as a realistic timeframe for improvements. The  
 supplier is asked to sign a corrective action plan. 
■ Worker interviews – We complement the information that we  
 obtain through worker interviews. CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   50
Depending on the situation, inspections may contain  
additional items: 
■ Pre-inspection questionnaire – In rare cases, we request the  
 supplier to fill in a pre-inspection self-assessment questionnaire.  
 This happens when an inspection cannot be made immediately  
 due to geographical distance, for instance.
■ Inspection of residential area – The residential facilities are   
 inspected for cleanliness and safety according to an audit form. 
Compliance mechanisms – our grading system 
We cooperate with our suppliers in order to improve the conditions 
in the factories they own or subcontract to. The purpose of our 
grading system is to find a tolerable level where we can start to work 
with the production units. It is primarily when we place orders that 
we have the chance to be truly influential. Finally, one must bear in 
mind that our suppliers and their production units differ substantially 
in regard to, for instance, size, company culture and ownership. The 
grading system is regularly modified in order to put further pressure 
on the production units. OUR GRADING SYSTEM
The grading scale consists of five levels: 
SATISFACTORY  – A production unit graded ‘satisfactory’ fulfils all 
‘insufficient’ requirements. In addition, the unit complies with all other 
Code of Conduct requirements, e.g. environmental aspects. 
INSUFFICIENT  – A production unit graded ‘insufficient’ fulfils all ‘tem -
porary’ requirements. In addition, our requirements in regard to safe -
ty, and housing and factory conditions are met. Overtime is always 
voluntary, and compensation is paid. Workers receive the sick leave 
that they are entitled to. 
TEMPORARY  – A production unit graded ‘temporary’ meets our 
requirements regarding worker’s basic rights, basic safety and basic 
housing conditions. A production unit that has been graded ‘tem -
porary’ has six months to make the improvements necessary to earn 
an ‘insufficient’ grade. 
REJECTED  – A supplier or production unit is graded ‘rejected’ if 
workers are denied any of their basic rights, if factory premises are 
unsafe, if the supplier has not signed our Code of Conduct, if H&M 
is denied access to the factory premises, or if management refuses 
to cooperate in other ways. A production unit that has been graded 
‘rejected’ can do business with H&M only if it makes major improve -
ments in accordance with our Code of Conduct. 
PERMANENTLY REJECTED  – Repeated employment of child labour, 
repeated use of faked documents, and repeated use of undeclared 
units are severe violations that cause H&M to permanently terminate 
business with a supplier. A supplier graded ‘permanently rejected’ 
can never again do business with H&M.CSR 2004 – OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   51
If a supplier’s production unit is graded rejected or permanently 
rejected, our purchase order system prevents our buyers from plac -
ing an order with that particular supplier.
Training our auditors 
The expectations on the performance of our Code of Conduct audi -
tors are high. Hence, we need to facilitate the basic conditions for 
every auditor to meet these expectations.
In order to secure the audit quality, and the continuous improve -
ments towards Code of Conduct compliance among our suppliers, it 
is of the utmost importance to give newly employed auditors a thor -
ough introduction to both H&M and to the audit profession. Finally, 
we need to continue to educate and challenge our auditors. 
H&M’s introduction plan for auditors covers topics that should be 
communicated in writing, orally, or through practical training. Some 
examples are:
■ Company values
■ H&M’s Code of Conduct
■ The ILO Core Conventions
■ The role of the auditor
■ Relevant labour law
■ H&M’s latest CSR report
■ Audit forms and guidelinesThe introduction is carried out by a senior auditor or by the 
Stockholm based Code of Conduct coordinators. 
Normally, H&M organises workshops for the auditors and other 
key employees in the production offices. These workshops are 
further education for our auditors. Their primary purpose is best 
practice exchange. Supply chain topics such as worker interviews, 
overtime, network building, piece-rate systems, migrant workers, 
work methodology and statistics are addressed. In 2004, one work -
shop was organised in China. All auditors attended.  
BSR Labour Standards Working Group
One of the important success factors commonly identified within the 
field of CSR is cooperation between companies within the garment 
industry. H&M participates in several formal and informal groups of 
garment brands and retailers working for a common goal of improv -
ing labour standards. One example of a formal group is the Labour 
Standards Working Group within BSR1.
Educating our supply chain
Education and awareness is crucial in order to improve conditions 
in the factories. Bad conditions are often a result of insufficient 
knowledge among factory management on all levels. To this end, 
H&M organises workshops on topics such as safety, local legislation, 
labour rights and human rights. The target groups are managers of 
our suppliers and their subcontractors. ■1 Business for Social

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL
RESPONSIBILITY
This section is divided into two main parts. The first part
gives an account of projects in the environmental area and
environmental performance. The second part describes our
policies and organisation. 
CSR 2004 – OUR ENVI RONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY   53
This section describes our environmental performance in terms of 
projects and tangible results. We describe three projects, and report 
on carbon dioxide emissions and recycled cardboard. The reasons 
for omitting other environmental aspects are explained.
Cleaner production programme for fabric mills
In the last few years H&M has run a pilot project, Supplier 
Environmental Motivation Strategy (SEMS), with four suppliers 
with the purpose of evaluating the possibilities of reducing the 
environmental impact of fabric production, particularly fabric dyeing 
and other processes that can lead to water pollution. These direct 
suppliers were vertical companies, which means that they have 
more production steps than garment manufacturing within their 
own operations. Normally these are production stages taking place 
earlier in the supply chain, meaning that H&M then has no direct 
business relationship with the dyeing mills. 
After evaluating the result of the SEMS project we came to the 
conclusion that the best approach is “cleaner production”, which 
is a preventive approach. The focus is on improving the processes 
in order to minimise pollution. We believe that the saving of energy, 
water and chemicals can result in a financial incentive for the mills to 
participate without the commercial pressure from a direct buyer.
During 2004, work on development of technical measures and 
management measures for cleaner production has been initiated 
in cooperation with a consultant and the Wuppertal Institute in 
Germany. The technical measures are descriptions of suggested 
process changes and the management measures are the required 
changes to the organisation, for example a responsible team, and 
introduction of measuring routines. The local partner in India is the 
National Cleaner Production Centre. The main focus is reduced con -
sumption of energy, water and chemicals, with focus on resource 
saving but also reduced emissions. Six fabric mills in India, supply -ing some of H&M’s major garment suppliers, have been selected for 
the initial trial of the cleaner production programme. A workshop to 
introduce the programme to the mills in India has been planned for 
early 2005.
EU Flower 
H&M has applied for a licence to use the EU Flower, the official eco 
label of the European Union (www.eco-label.co m). We plan to mark 
parts of H&M’s baby basic collection (approximately 250,000 pieces) 
with the EU Flower during 2005. H&M customers will recognize 
these cotton garments by a flower label on the packages and care 
labels. 
The EU Flower stands for restriction of hazardous substances and 
reduced water pollution in the whole production chain, from the cot -
ton wool to the finished product. In addition, the label’s quality crite -
ria represent the garments’ ability to keep their shape and colour. 
All products in the H&M collection will as usual be covered by 
H&M’s own chemical restrictions in order to minimise or exclude the 
use of substances that may be harmful to the health and/or to the 
environment. ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES  
AND PERFORMANCECSR 2004 – OUR ENVI RONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY   54
Organic cotton
We are aware of the negative environmental impact of conventional 
cotton farming. Therefore, H&M has started to include five per cent 
organic cotton in certain baby and children’s garments from Turkey. 
Initially this was a trial, including a process to get our suppliers’ 
spinners certified for the spinning of blended yarn with a five per 
cent organic cotton content.
In the first year 400,000 pieces of children’s garments were 
shipped from Turkey containing a total of five tonnes of organically 
grown cotton. These garments do not carry any special label.
For 2005 we are planning to increase the volumes and also to 
start trials in India. Our target for 2005 is to use at least 20 tonnes 
of organic cotton in our products. Although we are aware that only 
a very small fraction of the total cotton used for H&M’s products is 
organic, our aim is to contribute to an increased global demand for 
organic cotton. Since the conversion from conventional cotton farm -
ing to certified organic cotton farming takes three years, increase in 
global production can only happen gradually. It is H&M’s intention 
to continue to increase the volumes of organic cotton used in our 
products from year to year. We are also planning to source garments 
containing five per cent organic cotton from additional markets 
in the future and the first such delivery was made from India in 
December 2004. At present, we do not aim for products containing 
100 per cent organic cotton since it would not fit H&M’s profile and 
price structure.Carbon dioxide target
H&M’s activities produce emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases. A large part of our emissions comes from trans -
port and electricity, both related to fossil fuels. As a response, H&M 
is developing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
We have decided to target our most relevant greenhouse gas, 
carbon dioxide (CO 2). We have previously measured and reported 
on our CO 2 emissions. Now, we are taking a step further by develop -
ing a target for reduction of CO 2 emissions from H&M’s activities. 
The target is to reduce the emissions by a total of 10 per cent (on 
comparable figures) between 2005 and 2009. On average we must 
therefore reduce the CO 2 emissions by two per cent annually. The 
emissions are measured on a yearly basis in tonnes, and are related 
to annual turnover. In order to be able to track progress, the base 
year has been set to 2004.
The CSR department will work with the departments concerned in 
order to develop strategies for how the established group target can 
be met. CSR 2004 – OUR ENVI RONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY   55
Carbon dioxide data
The following elements are included in the carbon dioxide data: 
■ Purchased electricity in the entire company, where H&M  
 purchases direct from the supplier
■ Purchased heat for distribution centres, where H&M purchases  
 direct from the supplier
■ Purchased fuels for heating of distribution centres, where H&M  
 purchases direct from the supplier
■ Purchased transport of goods (road, sea, rail)
■ Purchased transport of goods (air, sea/air)
■ Purchased transport of personnel
■ Purchased fuels for vehicles owned by H&M
The shops where H&M purchases electricity direct from the supplier 
account for 85 per cent of annual turnover. For the remaining 15 per 
cent of the shops, the cost of electricity is included in shop leases.
Details about data acquisition can be found in the annexes. 
Carbon dioxide performance
The list and table below show carbon dioxide emissions caused by 
H&M operations. The bulleted list states carbon dioxide emissions 
2000–2004. The table displays emissions in tonnes for 2003 and 
2004. Each source’s share of total emissions is shown. The change in emissions between 2003 and 2004 is presented as well. Please 
note that the 2003 figures have been adjusted for the calculation 
error described in the annex. Hence, the table shows that purchased 
electricity produced 100,394 and not 76,384 tonnes of carbon diox -
ide in 2003. 
■ 2000: 102,494 tonnes (excluding air and sea/air transport)
■ 2001: 124,611 tonnes (excluding air and sea/air transport)
■ 2002: 158,690 tonnes (134,437 stated in CSR Report 2003,   
 excluding air and sea/air transport)

Below, we have related carbon dioxide emissions to annual turnover. 
Please note that our data did not include air transport prior to 2003. 
Therefore, one graph displays CO 2 emissions excluding air and 
sea/air transport. In this way, the data for 2000–2004 becomes com -
parable. The other graph displays CO 2 emissions including air and 
sea/air transport (2003 and 2004). Both graphs have been adjusted 
for the mentioned calculation error (data for 2002 and 2003).  
Finally, the fact that we sell more goods at lower prices affects the 
CO 2/turnover quota, and should therefore be taken into considera -
tion. Conclusions
The actual increase of carbon dioxide emissions is from 204,040 
tonnes in 2003 to 241,583 tonnes in 2004, i.e. 18.4 per cent. This 
increase is almost on a level with the increase in sold volumes (16 
per cent). 
One factor that helps to explain this year’s higher CO 2 figures is 
that we have not used old data to the same extent as last year. For 
example, we have new data on energy consumption in the USA. 
Due to the substantial growth in the US market, these figures are 
now considerably higher. Another contributory cause is that Belgium 
has reported a power generation mix that produces more carbon 
dioxide emissions. 
There are several reasons for the increase in emissions produced 
by transport of goods. For instance, there has been an increase in 
purchased volumes. Another explanation is that the data for 2004 is 
more comprehensive. For example, combined modes of transport 
(e.g. sea/air) were not included until now. Yet another explanation 
is that this year’s data has been collected and processed with 
greater precision. We have had to evaluate and correct data that 
we obtained from some of our transport service providers. Also, a 
courier company has stated significantly higher CO 2 figures for 
2004 (1,280 tonnes, cf. 54 tonnes for 2003). As the amount spent on 
courier services in 2004 was about the same as in 2003, we have 
come to the conclusion that the 2003 figures could not have been 
accurate. This difference has had a noticeable effect on the total 
carbon dioxide emission figures.

Direct energy use
Energy use is continuously on the agenda, not least from a cost 
perspective. In addition, there is a clear link between cutting energy 
use and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The below table shows 
H&M’s direct energy use in gig joules. 
Omitted environmental aspects
H&M sells garments and accessories to the consumer market. 
Consequently, it is not feasible to monitor and measure emissions 
generated by use and disposal of our products. Further, it is not 
possible to measure the emissions caused in our supply chain. The 
sewing and assembling of garments alone employs approximately 
2,000 production units. It is not possible to collect and report reli -
able figures from these production units. 
Emissions to water and use of water are significant aspects in the 
production and use of garments. For shops, offices, and warehous -
es, water is used purely for sanitary needs. Due to the complexity of 
collecting and aggregating data, we have decided not to measure 
emissions to water and use of water throughout the production and 
use of our products. 
Nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions are most -
ly related to transport. Evaluating features like engine type and fuel 
type is at this point too complex. Nevertheless, we strive to reduce 
the emissions by setting minimum requirements for our transport 
service providers’ engine and fuel types. ■SOURCE GIG JOULES

1,444,512
Waste management
Solid waste is a significant aspect in our stores and at our distribu -
tion centres. Waste handling in our shops differs depending on sales 
country. In Norway, for example, the vast majority of the shops use 
the waste handling system of the shopping centre or landlord. In 
the USA, on the other hand, more than half of the shops have a 
separate contract with a waste handling company. In Germany, over 
half of the waste is sent back to H&M’s warehouse. Due to this com -
plexity, it is difficult to measure, compare and report on how different 
types of waste are handled. 
However, we are able to present figures on recycled cardboard, 
as it is mainly collected at our distribution centres. In spite of a 16 
per cent increase in total volumes, and frequent use of cardboard 
boxes rather than hanging garment transportation, the increase in 
cardboard collected and recycled at our distribution centres was 
only 13 per cent. YEAR CARDBOARD IN TONNES CHANGE

 Main aspects 
Our environmental coordinator and CSR manager have conducted 
an environmental impact assessment, and identified the following 
environmental aspects. 
The most substantial environmental effects occur in the dyeing 
and processing of fibres and fabrics. Examples of aspects in the 
garment production are energy consumption, water pollution and 
chemical handling. H&M’s Code of Conduct includes environmental 
requirements. 
Transport of H&M goods accounts for approximately 46 per cent 
of total carbon dioxide emissions caused by H&M operations. 
Therefore, it is vital for us and our transport service providers to try 
to use more environment friendly transport.
At the end of 2004, H&M operated 1,068 shops and 15 distribution 
centres. Our operations generate waste from packaging, hangers, 
decorative materials, disposable materials etc. It is our ambition to 
reduce waste, and re-use and recycle waste material when possible.ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

Our environmental organisation 
Our CSR manager is part of H&M’s management team and reports 
to the Managing Director. H&M’s environmental coordinators are 
part of the CSR department, and manage all environmental activities. 
The following corporate functions have environmental representa -
tives; advertising, building, IT, logistics, travel, and H&M Rowells. 
The representatives’ prime function is to be the communicative link 
with the CSR department. All major production offices and sales 
offices also have environmental representatives. There are 31 envi -
ronmental representatives in total.
Environmental information to employees
Our environmental information is communicated through a number 
of different channels. Colleagues who make decisions with high 
impact on the environment receive more in-depth education. For 
other employees we mainly focus on awareness building. We use 
the communication channels listed below. 
■ H&M's internet site (www.hm.com/cs r) – The CSR report  
 can be downloaded here. Hence, this is where the most  
 comprehensive information is found. 
■ H&M Wallpaper is our news billboard. It is found on walls near  
 lunchrooms and other social areas in the entire company. 
■ H&M's intranet – All H&M offices have access to the intranet. 
■ Education at the buying office (optional) – This education takes  
 place approximately twice a year.
■ Key group education - During 2004, the logistics department and  
 all distribution centre managers received environmental training. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
Continuous improvements are significant for all H&M activities. This  
includes our environmental effort, which is conducted within the 
framework of our business operations. H&M’s business concept is 
to give our customers unsurpassed value by offering fashion and 
quality at the best price. Our quality concept is based on ensuring 
that our customers are satisfied with our products and H&M as a 
company.
To this end, we are committed to acting responsibly in our com -
munity. We shall also cooperate with our suppliers to improve the 
social and environmental standards in the factories that manufacture 
H&M clothing, thereby contributing to sustainable development in 
these areas. To achieve this goal, H&M has adopted the following 
principles.  
 
We shall …  
- always consider the health and safety of our employees. By adop -
ting the precautionary principle, we will continuously update our 
restrictions against the use of environmentally and health hazardous 
chemicals in the production of our garments and other products.
- continuously update ourselves on environmental news and legisla -
tion. We will not be content to follow existing environmental legisla -
tion, but will in certain areas do more than the law requires.
- conduct our business in a manner that utilises natural resources as 
efficiently as possible.
- develop new and continuously improve existing environmental 
requirements concerning the purchase of products and services.
- train, inform and motivate our employees to participation and 
responsibility, thereby making environmental work an integrated part 
of H&M daily routines.
- specify for our suppliers our position regarding behaviour towards 
the environment and human rights and follow up to ensure that our 
suppliers improve their operations according to these requirements.CSR 2004 – OUR ENVI RONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY   63
Environmental requirements for transport service providers 
Generally, H&M cooperates with one transport service provider per 
country of production and means of transport. 
Since 2001, our transport service providers are evaluated on a 
variety of environmental issues in order to improve their environmen -
tal performance. 
From January 1, 2003 the following minimum requirements apply  
to road transport service providers:
■ Road transport for H&M must be carried out with vehicles  
 meeting the requirements of Euro 1 or US 91. 
■ All vehicles purchased must meet the requirements of  
 Euro 2 or US 94. 
■ Diesel with maximum sulphur content of 350 ppm (0.035%).
■ Instructions to drivers on what fuel type to use.
■ At least 25 per cent of all drivers must have received theoretical  
 and practical training on fuel-efficient driving, i.e. eco-driving. 
■ Company policy banning idling in excess of one minute.  
Forthcoming minimum requirements: 
■ Road transport for H&M must be carried out with vehicles  
 meeting the requirements of Euro 2 or US 94 (as of January 2006). 
■ All vehicles purchased must meet the requirements of  
 Euro 3 or US 98 (as of January 2005).
■ At least 50 per cent of all drivers must have received theoretical  
 and practical training on fuel-efficient driving, i.e. eco-driving  
 (as of January 2005). During 2004, we made random checks of engine type and vehicle 
age at our distribution centres in Hamburg, Germany. By doing this, 
we were able to determine if our transport service providers at least 
met the requirements of Euro 0. We identified only one service pro -
vider that did not comply with these requirements.
Environmental requirements for other business partners 
H&M sets minimum environmental standards when purchasing shop 
equipment. Apart from legal requirements we also apply a number of 
H&M specific environmental requirements. The following materials, 
metals and chemicals should generally be avoided in the production 
process or the product itself:
■ Materials:  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), halogen-based plastic  
 materials, paper-based materials processed with chlorine or  
 chlorine derivates, and tropical wood (unless FSC1 labelled). 
■ Metals:  Lead, chrome (especially Cr6+), cadmium, mercury.
■ Chemicals:  Bisphenol A, brominated or chlorinated flame-  
 retardants, e.g. polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), polybrominated  
 diphenyl ether (PBDE), octabromodiphenyl (octaBDE),

H&M sets minimum environmental standards  
for IT product purchases 
H&M uses the eco-declaration developed by Svenska IT-företagens 
organisation (IT-företagen; Organisation of Swedish IT Companies). 
The Nemko Group, a Norwegian firm that offers testing, inspection 
and certification services, randomly examines the information that IT 
companies submit. 
Every year, 25 per cent of all companies that participate in the eco-
declaration cooperation are chosen for examination. Declarations 
for one product from each company are assessed. If a company is 
found consciously declaring false information, IT-företagen will expel 
that member. Our various suppliers of IT equipment have to send 
in one eco-declaration for every product they offer. We evaluate all 
answers to find an acceptable level. Any product that does not meet 
legal requirements is automatically rejected. H&M’s requirements are 
based on our sales countries’ legislation and our own standard.Certification 
H&M’s environmental management system is not ISO-certified. We 
believe that the construction of ISO is not compatible with our meth -
ods of working. Nevertheless, we consider it important to have a 
systematic approach to our environmental work. It is our ambition to 
make environmental considerations an integral part of our everyday 
decisions and operations. ■H&M

Fair Trade Center 
“During 2004 Fair Trade Center was invited by H&M to comment 
on its CSR report for 2003. This is a comment on the information 
presented by H&M in their CSR report and is not a statement on the 
actual performance of H&M.
We welcome H&M’s ambition to publish the social and environ -
mental costs of the production in a yearly CSR report. It is essential 
that companies disclose this to make it possible for consumers, 
investors and decision-makers to make ethically balanced choices 
and decisions. The report covers most areas relevant to a garment 
company like H&M. The most important area left out relates to envi -
ronmental effects and working conditions in the production of textile 
fibres, such as cotton.
H&M’s code of conduct states that ‘We have to make sure that 
nobody whose work contributes to our success is deprived of his 
or her human rights, or suffers mental or bodily harm.’ This is not 
the reality of H&M’s production today, and unfortunately this is not 
made clear in the report. The report does not describe the condi -
tions under which H&M’s products are produced. From the report 
it is impossible to see to what extent H&M’s code of conduct is 
followed. H&M holds much of this information already, and it should 
be presented.
This lack of quantitative information on working conditions makes 
it hard for the reader to follow the development of H&M’s work. The 
reader will not be able to know if H&M is indeed improving, or if 
conditions are actually deteriorating. The need for proper payment (i.e. a living wage) is directly linked to 
many of H&M’s problems such as inhumane working hours. H&M 
does admit that minimum wages are too low in several countries 
of production, among them Bangladesh. But nothing is said about 
what proportion of the garments are produced by what H&M itself 
admits are underpaid workers. Fair Trade Center urges H&M to 
revise its code to live up to the standard of UN Declaration of 
Human Rights, which prescribes the right to a living wage. 
The management system for dealing with environmental and 
social issues is outlined in a comprehensive way. The report makes 
clear that the monitoring system of working conditions relies on a 
top-down approach, but makes no mention of if and how the wor-
kers are involved in securing that their rights are respected.
Lastly, the CSR report lacks information on whether and how H&M 
has changed purchasing practices to make it easier for suppliers 
to follow the code. H&M should describe whether cost-sharing, 
extended production lead times or other measures have been taken. 
If H&M would take these remarks into consideration when doing 
their future CSR reports, we think it could become an important tool 
in creating lasting social and environmental improvements in the 
production of garments.”

“As we review H&M’s work with CSR issues, we see a company that 
sets high standards and takes social issues seriously. It is our under -
standing that the company wants the products sold in its shops to 
be manufactured under decent working conditions and without a 
negative impact on the environment. This is expressed in the fact 
that the company stands behind the ILO Core Conventions, the 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Global 
Compact.
Despite this, we, as a trade union with considerable international 
contacts, conclude that it is not enough. More needs to be done to 
ensure that everyone concerned is at least able to enjoy the condi -
tions that the company’s policy prescribes. 
We are convinced that the most important measure for better 
compliance with the company’s social policy is to make sure that 
the ILO Convention No. 87 (on the freedom of association) and No. 
98 (on the right to bargain collectively) are observed. 
What we require is for H&M, in cooperation with free democratic 
trade union, to guarantee that its own employees as well as people 
employed in the supply chain are educated and informed about their 
rights, and that their right of association is not violated. 
Free democratic trade unions with the capacity to negotiate are 
fundamental in ensuring reasonable wage levels and working condi -
tions in the labour market. Parties that enter into agreements with 
each other are also best placed to ensure that the parties comply 
with the agreement. No supervisory organisations in the world 
can replace the supervision that constantly present parties can guarantee. H&M has signed a global agreement with UNI covering 
the company’s own employees. H&M’s CSR work would improve 
considerably if the company were to sign an agreement that cov -
ered the entire production and sales chain. The agreement should 
contain clearly defined rules regarding implementation, follow-up 
and supervision, and furthermore, it should be signed both by UNI 
and ITGLWF . 
The CSR report needs a better and more clearly-defined account 
of H&M’s CSR policy. This is particularly important since the CSR 
year-end statement should be evaluated in the context of the com -
pany’s policy. The report should also be more reader-friendly and 
accessible.
As H&M is supporting the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises and the UN Global Compact, the company’s Code of 
Conduct should be updated so that the different documents are in 
line with each other. In order to avoid any doubt about the fact that 
H&M is fully committed to the interpretation and application of the 
ILO Core Conventions, each convention should be listed and related 
with numbers to the applicable part of the Code of Conduct. 
The report could well be split up into a descriptive section with 
policy and facts, and a section that gives an account of the previ -
ous year’s CSR work. The latter section should contain statistics 
on suppliers etc. with information about numbers, grading etc. 
inspections, problem areas, complaints and how they were handled, 
education, etc. The report would be improved by being structured 
as a clear account of the results and conditions in all areas referred 
to in the company’s social policy.  CSR 2004 – ANNEXES   68
At the end of the report there is a description of a number of social 
projects supported by H&M. These are certainly sound and worthy 
projects, but until all of the employees covered by H&M’s social 
policy are able to enjoy basic union and human rights in their wor-
king life, all strength and energy should be put into this area. 
Finally, it is unacceptable that the CSR report is currently only avail -
able in English. The report should be accessible to everyone con -
cerned, i.e. it should be translated into the languages used wherever 
H&M has sales activities or where the company’s suppliers are 
located. In order to reach a wider audience, the annual CSR report 
could be summarised into a simplified version.”  ■

Previously, we have had a problem obtaining fully reliable data. To 
some extent, the problem still exists. Our electricity suppliers have 
provided us with records of electricity consumption in kilowatt-
hours (kWh) and conversion factors1. As mentioned above, these 
consumption records are for 85 per cent of all H&M shops. Our road, 
sea, and rail transport service providers have given us data about 
H&M’s part of their carbon dioxide emissions. Our air transport 
providers have given us information on routes and the weight of the 
goods transported on our behalf. Based on this information and the 
calculation template NTMCalc from the Network for Transport and 
the Environment ( www.ntm.a.s e), we have been able to estimate 
carbon dioxide emissions caused by our air transport. 
Spain and Portugal’s power generation mixes2 were not known 
to us. Therefore, we have made assumptions. However, Spain and 
Portugal’s energy consumption represents a mere two per cent of 
total energy consumption. Thus, the data is 98 per cent accurate. 
This year, we have used old data for rail transport in the USA, 
and road and rail transport for H&M Rowells in Sweden. This data 
accounts for one per cent, which means that the figures are 99 per 
cent correct. CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS  
– DATA ACQUISITION 
1 Conversion factors can be used 
in order to convert energy con -
sumed in kWh to kilos of carbon 
dioxide. 
2 The proportion of electricity dist -
ributed by a power provider that 
is generated from available sour -
ces such as coal, natural gas, 
petroleum, nuclear, hydropower, 
wind, or geothermal.Finally, we need to point out that this year’s increased carbon 
dioxide figures in part stem from a considerable calculation error 
from 2002 and 2003. Mistakenly, the wrong conversion factor was 
used for Germany’s data. More precisely, coal-fired power (820  g 
CO2/kWh) was mixed up with combined power and heat (360 g 
CO2/kWh). Given that Germany is H&M’s largest market, this error 
caused a substantial difference. In reality purchased electricity in 
2003 produced 100,394 tons carbon dioxide, not 76,384, as was 
stated in our previous CSR report. This means that the increase in 
carbon dioxide emissions between 2003 and 2004 is in fact  
18.4 per cent. ■CSR 2004 – ANNEXES   70
