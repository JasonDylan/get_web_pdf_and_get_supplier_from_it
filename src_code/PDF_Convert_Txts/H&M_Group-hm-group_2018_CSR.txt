OVERVIEW
 LETTER FROM CEO  / EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / KEY ACHIEVEMENTS 2018 / AWARDS & RECOGNITIONS / ABOUT H&M GROUP / OUR VALUE CHAINOVERVIEW
Letter from CEO
A little more than 70 years ago, my 
grandfather opened a shop selling wom -
en’s apparel in the small Swedish town 
of Västerås. He believed that everyone 
should have the opportunity to express 
their personality through fashion and 
he saw it as his mission to democratise 
fashion and make it available to all 
rather than the privileged few. The con -
cept of “Fashion for everyone, at a great 
price” has remained with our company 
ever since.
In the same way that we took the lead 70 
years ago by making fashion accessible 
to all, we now want to take the lead in 
ensuring a more sustainable fashion 
industry by tackling some of the most 
significant challenges that are facing our 
planet and society.   
We are part of an industry which 
undoubtedly faces significant chal -
lenges when it comes to environmental 
and social sustainability – but I want 
H&M group to continue to be a positive 
force towards resolving these shared challenges. We know that we are a large 
company and we therefore know that we 
have an equally large responsibility to 
ensure that we have a positive impact on 
our planet.
As such I am proud to say that our 
sustainability work is embedded in our 
culture and our values. A long-term 
approach is a natural and important 
part of our overall business strategy. We 
also believe that taking a long-term view 
is crucial when it comes to dealing with 
complex sustainability issues.
According to the UN, climate change 
and poverty are two of the most signi -
ficant challenges of our time and will 
affect many generations to come. While 
I have a great deal of respect for the vast 
complexity of both of these challenges, 
I also strongly believe that we can make 
a positive contribution towards facing 
them. We will continue to take a long-
term approach to achieve sustainable 
production, while at the same time cre -
ating good jobs and driving prosperity 
in the markets in which we operate.
H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 20185 OF 109
OVERVIEWHOW WE REPORT STANDARDS & POLICIES 100% FAIR & EQUAL 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE VISION & STRATEGY
In order for our company to take on 
these challenges in an effective way 
I believe that sustainability must be 
considered as an integral part of our 
business rather than being treated as 
an after-thought. For this reason, we 
work to ensure that sustainability is 
integrated into all aspects of our busi -
ness – it should pervade everything 
that we do, all the decisions we make 
and the everyday work of all our 
employees. 
Taking this approach makes it possible 
for all of us to work towards the same 
goal. For this reason, all functions 
within H&M group are assessed on 
the basis of sustainability objectives, 
which are just as important as any 
other benchmark. 
However, it is not possible to achieve 
great change in isolation. We have 
over 70 years of experience, but we are 
entirely dependent on our partnerships 
with experts from other fields to really 
drive our sustainability work forward. 
We therefore fully support the develop -
ment of the new technology and innovation that is required to create a 
circular fashion industry. 
Encouragement of and collaboration 
with other forces for positive change 
is especially important when it comes 
to the complex challenges faced by the 
fashion industry, and indeed all other 
industries. Just a few examples of our 
collaborations include: our work with 
WWF on the responsible use of water 
in our value chain, our investment in 
innovations companies that are devel -
oping technologies for textile recy -
cling, and our close partnership with 
the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that 
is helping drive the development of a 
circular economy as well as our work 
with the UN and textile workers’ global 
trade union who are advising us about 
the best way to tackle the huge issue of 
wages in the textile industry.
The values of H&M group also include 
a constant willingness to innovate 
and look at things in new ways. Today, 
we are using AI to make it easier for 
us to ensure a good match between 
production and demand, thus saving energy, transport and resources. We are 
switching to renewable electricity and 
streamlining our use of energy. With 
the help of innovation, we are not only 
able to find new sustainable materials 
and recover textile fibres in a better 
way than before, but we can also make 
this scalable in the long term. I am 
impressed every year by the winners of 
the Global Change Award challenge for 
innovation, which was founded by H&M 
Foundation – it presents solid proof that 
a circular fashion industry is possible. 
The transformation of orange peel and 
algae into fabric and grape residue into 
plant-based leather, are just a few of 
the great ideas that have been realised. 
I’m convinced that technical innova -
tions will be the solution to many of the 
environmental challenges the textile 
industry is facing and will contribute to 
a more sustainable consumption.
The reality is that as our population 
grows, so does also consumption, 
which already today goes beyond what 
the planet can afford. The key to our 
future is therefore to ensure that we 
move away from an old, linear and environmentally hazardous system to 
a circular one that ensures long-term 
environmental and social sustain -
ability. Big leaps towards new and 
greener solutions, are usually taken 
by companies and countries that are 
developing and can therefore invest 
in technological innovations. As such 
consumption that contributes to both 
reducing global poverty and enabling 
investment in modern, sustainable 
production is not the problem, but 
instead part of the solution.
This report is our opportunity to share 
an honest and transparent account of 
the positive steps that we have taken 
so far as well as the complex challenges 
we continue to face. It helps us under -
stand both the areas in which we have 
made progress, and those that we need 
to re-think and further develop. While 
I am proud of our achievements, I am 
aware that there is still a lot more for 
us to do. However, I remain convinced 
that our long-term approach coupled 
with our genuine determination, will 
help us lead the way to creating a more 
sustainable fashion industry. OVERVIEW

Since day one, our business has 
been about bringing fashion and 
design to all people. Today, this 
is reflected in all our brands. We 
are always working to create the 
best offering for our customers, in 
the most sustainable way.
H&M group includes nine brands, 
each with their own specific 
brand DNA – H&M, COS, Week -
day, Cheap Monday*,  Monki, H&M 
Home, & Other Stories, ARKET 
and Afound.  Together, our 
brands offer customers a wealth 
of styles and trends in fashion, 
beauty, accessories and home -ware – as well as healthy, modern 
food in selected stores.
We reach customers around the 
world through our integrated 
physical stores and digital 
channels. Our customer proxim -
ity is amplified by our 177,000 
colleagues globally, operating 
in both sales and production 
markets.
*As previously communicated, Cheap Monday will 
be ending operations in 2019. The H&M group’s 
transition work in response to the extensive 
changes within the fashion industry means that the 
company is prioritising and focusing on its core 
business. Cheap Monday’s business model is based 
on traditional wholesale, which is a model that 
has faced major challenges due to the shift in the 
industry. The H&M group has therefore decided to 
close Cheap Monday.OVERVIEW

Our vision is to lead the change towards a circular

and equal company. To do this, it is our respon -
sibility to ensure our value chain works to its 
full potential. Our value chain describes the full 
sequence of processes involved in the production 
and lifespan of all our products, from product idea -
tion to customer use and disposal.
But our value chain does not operate in isolation. 
With nine brands selling products in over 4,968 
stores and online markets in 47 countries, it is 
connected to countless people, communities, eco -
systems and other businesses around the world.
IMPACTS ALONG OUR VALUE CHAIN 
Our vast network of value chain connections  
means that our social, environmental and eco -
nomic impacts are significant and far-reaching.  
To maintain our business idea, we need to  
maximise our positive impacts and minimise  
our negative impacts throughout our value chain 
and along every customer’s journey with us. 
To make this happen, we use our size and scale 
to drive change and innovation in all parts of 
the value chain, from raw materials to customer 
 experience.

*Climate impacts are based on a scope 3 assessment made by Ecofys in 2017, based on 2016 data. Deviation from 100% is 
due to omission of other emission sources not fitting the format of this illustration, the major one being the scope 3 category 
purchased products (other expenditures). The water footprint is based on the Water Footprint Network’s methodology and 
includes green, blue and grey water footprints. Deviation from 100% is due to rounding effects.

Our vision is to lead the change towards 
a circular and renewable fashion indus -
try, while being a fair and equal com -
pany. Using our size and scale, we are 
working to catalyse systemic changes 
across our own operations, our entire 
value chain and the wider industry. In 
this way, we can continue to engage our 
customers and provide great fashion 
and design choices – today, and into the 
future.
Our vision and strategy applies to all 
our brands, while allowing each of them 
to maintain their own brand identity.
While our business has a long and well- 
established history in sustainability, 
projected population growth figures 
and natural resource levels make it 
clear that a more focused approach to 
sustainable fashion is needed. Our role, 
as leaders in our industry, is to inno -
vate, influence, collaborate, and lead 
the way towards a truly sustainable 
fashion future.At H&M group, we’ve always believed that great design should – 
and can – be available to anyone. From the beginning, our role 
has been to democratise fashion. Today, that means making it 
sustainable: it’s the only way we’ll keep making great fashion and 
design available to many people, for many years to come. 
This vision is not only necessary from 
a social and environmental perspec -
tive, it also makes good business sense. 
Long-term investments in sustainabil -
ity provide us with long-term business 
opportunities that will keep H&M 
group relevant and successful in our 
rapidly changing world.
We know that achieving our vision  
will not be easy, but our openness to 
tackling challenges keeps us alert  
to opportunity. We are strongly posi -
tioned to make a positive impact, in 
part because of our continuing part -
nership with stakeholders and industry 
experts who help set and shape our 
sustainability work. Further  more, by 
applying a science-based approach to 
our work, we can set the best goals and 
roadmaps possible to drive positive 
change throughout our company and 
the wider industry.Our vision & strategy

By steering and integrating sustainability 
across our business, our Change-Making 
Programme turns our strategy into action 
and drives long-lasting change.
H&M group is comprised of multiple brands, which 
operate in a variety of functions across many different 
countries and cultures. Similarly, our value chain is 
vast and complex. Along with the obvious opportunity 
this scale offers, it also presents a big challenge: how 
do we drive systematic and effective long-term change 
across both our business and value chain?
HOW WE INTEGRATE SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainability is integrated as one of four equally 
important parameters in our company performance 
score card. This means that each central function 
and brand is measured on a set of sustainability 
KPI’s, alongside and in equal weight to sales figures, 
customer satisfaction, etc. In addition to that, our 
Change-Making Programme brings together the 
goals, roadmaps, standards and follow-up  methods 
we need to work towards our vision, while also 
leaving room for locally tailored implementation and 
activities. This enables our brands and functions 
to take ownership and integrate our sustainability 
strategy across the business, setting its own meas -
urable sustainability goals and activities. Within 
each sales market, we employ a dedicated sustain -
ability manager who drives the implementation of 
our  strategy from a local perspective to engage all 
colleagues and customers.Our Change-Making Programme

“ We must continue to dare and push the boundaries ”
The fashion industry is going through a 
major transformation. How is H&M group 
positioning itself to be a part of this journey?  
As a major player in the industry, we are 
well-positioned to not only be part of, but 
to also lead the change on this journey. One 
area that we have been focusing on for a 
while is the shift from a linear to a circular 
business model, where we have the ambi -
tion to become fully circular.
We are also constantly innovating and 
developing our sustainability work in line 
with other developments in the industry. For 
example, we have accelerated our invest -
ments in AI and algorithm-driven retail and 
see them as important tools to not only 
grow our business in a sustainable way, but 
also reach our sustainability goals. 
How do you see the customer becoming a 
part of H&M group’s sustainability journey?
Today we see a positive trend in customer 
behavior, where more and more customers 
want to know where and how the garments 
are made, and how they can contribute to 
a sustainable fashion future. This year, we 
have developed a customer-facing transpar -
ency layer where our online customers can 
see sustainability information such as mate -
rials used, or in which factory the product 
has been made. 
We have also expanded our Take Care con -
cept across more markets, which we see as I also wish that we could have come even 
further. But the issue of wages goes far 
beyond our own suppliers and their factories 
and we alone cannot change the industry. 
This also goes for many other sustainability 
challenges, such as scaling technologies for 
garment recycling, developing solutions for 
microfibre shedding and driving transpar -
ency on sustainability performance across 
the industry. 
Another important lesson from this year is 
the need to constantly keep sustainability 
integrated into the business, which can be a 
challenge given the rapid change and trans -
formation that the retail industry is under -
going. In the light of the hoodie incident, we 
have learned that we need to do even more 
to integrate inclusion and diversity across 
our operations and beyond. 
Back to H&M group leading the change  
in the fashion industry transformation. 
Where do you see us in five years? 
I hope that we will continue to lead the 
change towards a sustainable fashion 
industry. With all the technological advance -
ments and ever-changing expectations from 
customers, it’s hard to have a clear picture 
of what exactly will be happening five years 
from now. But I am positive, that by then we 
will see a wide use of both circular technol -
ogies and renewable energy that will move 
the fashion industry within the planetary boundaries. I hope that we will continue 
to stay true to our long-term direction and 
at the same time keep our agility. And of 
course, that we continue to dare, push 
boundaries, test, and never be afraid to fail.

colleagues during 
the Fair Living 
Wage Summit in 
Cambodia.an important step in helping our customers 
care for their favorite pieces longer and in 
that way prolong the lifespan of the product.
Looking back over the year, what has been 
the greatest achievement?
There are many things I’m proud to have 
been a part of, but one that stands out this 
year is our results from the five-year Fair 
Living Wage Strategy. We have not only 
achieved, but exceeded in all our goals, 
affecting the lives of almost one million 
garment workers. This has been the result of 
many of my colleagues’ tremendous efforts 
to make an impact and drive change in a 
very challenging area. There is still a lot to be 
done and I can’t stress enough the need of 
alignment between different actors through-
out the whole industry. 
Another achievement is our new packaging 
strategy, which is an important milestone 
towards our circular ambition. With our goal 
to only use recycled or sustainably sourced 
packaging materials by 2030, we will be able 
to have a big environmental impact, create a 
better shopping experience for our custom -
ers, and a better work environment for our 
colleagues. 
… and what are the biggest lessons learned?  
That big change takes a long time. For 
example, even though I am very proud of

Many of the sustainability challenges 
facing our industry require intense inno -
vation to find solutions. These challenges 
also present us with business opportuni -
ties. For example, there is not yet a viable 
technology for recycling of blended fibres 
at scale, which means we cannot make 
new products from as many old products 
as we would like. To tackle this, we are 
currently working with experts who are 
developing new scalable technological 
solutions that will transform the way our 
industry works with materials.
At H&M group, we have a responsibil -
ity, as well as an opportunity to iden -
tify, invest in and promote sustainable 
innovations, from digital systems that 
provide traceability information to new 
energy-saving solutions. Our size and 
global reach means we can take the most 
promising sustainable innovations to 
scale and help create the transformation 
our industry needs.
HOW WE APPROACH INNOVATION
To make our business better, we use 
innovation to challenge our thinking 
and give us new perspectives. Across 
our company, we prototype ideas that Innovation
Innovation is the key to 
achieving industry-wide change.
At H&M group, we have an internal inno -
vation department called the Laboratory. 
It is our home for research and develop -
ment and it exists to challenge our think -
ing and give us fresh perspectives, turning 
research into action through co-creation, 
launching new business and service 
models. Laura Coppen works as Creative 
Business Development at the Laboratory.
What is it like to work with innovation?
Working with innovation is a constant 
adventure, one has to navigate through a 
global landscape of trends, both macro 
and micro, identifying the key areas that 
will disrupt our industry. For me, working 
with innovation means collaborating; we 
work with an external and internal net -
work of experts to support us and make 
our concepts come to life. In today’s 
ever increasingly complex landscape it’s 
necessary to look at the whole picture, the 
whole system. 
What trends do you see when it comes 
to innovation?
The trend I’m most focused on is the rise 
in responsible businesses and service 
models. These have an action-driven agenda towards changing the fashion industry and 
are transitioning to a circular economy 
model while building a socially and environ -
mentally positive supply chain. That is a huge 
shift, and much more than a trend, it is the 
necessary future. We are proud to be one of 
the leaders on this journey.
What projects are you working with right 
now?
We are working on a concept that is centred 
around the future of local, smart and circular 
manufacturing. This model enables us to 
be faster to customers’ demands and test 
new technologies like custom fit, customi -
zation and small batch collections with new 
machinery. We are also looking into several 
areas within service models, from remaking, 
to renting and renewing products. Alongside 
new packaging solutions and the greater 
system around online logistics.
How can innovation help us achieve our 
sustainability goals?
Innovation is a necessary part of reaching 
our sustainability goals. With the huge shift 
that we need to make in the fashion indus -
try, we can’t rely on what already exists. We 
need new materials, processes and busi -ness models, which we are on the journey 
of creating with many of our partners. Right 
now, an intrapreneurial spirit is needed – in 
all companies, including ours – to achieve 
the sustainability goals. It’s an ‘all hands on 
deck’ time!

that our commitment to sustainability demands 
both a new way of working and a new way of 
thinking.
Our approach to innovation always starts by 
looking at our customers’ needs alongside the 
macro and micro trends that are changing our 
industry and the world around us. We then 
employ a design and system thinking approach to 
problem solving and innovation. Finally, we take 
the best and most promising innovations and use 
our size to help them scale.
This involves looking at the wider systems and 
trends we are a part of – both now and in the 
future. We have an opportunity to rethink how 
we organise global production and consumer 
demand, and to access cutting edge technologies 
and innovative business models. We have a wide 
network of partners that help us identify and

ALGORITHM-DRIVEN RETAIL 
To further secure an organization that drives 
innovation and optimizes business decisions 
which enable sustainable choices, H&M group 
is working with advanced analytics and artifi -
cial intelligence. Our new AI department sup -
ports various processes across our entire value 
chain – from design to customer experience. For 
example, by amplifying the decision making of 
our designers and buyers we can ensure that we 
are designing the right products. We also use 
advanced analytics and AI to better forecast 
trends, make sure the right products are in the 
right stores, and to give our customers even more 
relevant and customized recommendations and 
offers. Used right, AI is one of the most powerful 
tools we have to secure that we meet our future 
in a sustainable way through the lens of a circu -
lar economy.Arti Zeighami, Head of Advanced 
Analytics and AI at H&M group:  
How are your colleagues using  
AI tools in their work? 
When we talk about AI at H&M group, 
we mean Amplified Intelligence. 
Advanced analytics and machine 
learning are tools that enhance our 
human intelligence. Amplified intelli -
gence is the collaboration between 
machines and humans – between 
science and art, data and gut feeling. 
We are creating solutions that help our 
colleagues make more precise deci -
sions, and enable them to focus on the 
most relevant and creative parts of 
their work.
What is the connection between   
AI and sustainability? 
Circularity is ultimately about 
using resources sustainably, where 
one central aspect is to avoid 
over-production. With the help of advanced analytics and AI, we can be 
much sharper in aligning supply and 
demand. This could also entail less 
transport and warehousing, which 
means less energy is used. It’s really 
a win-win situation: while creating an even more relevant offering for our 
customers, we are reducing the envi -
ronmental impact of our operations.
AI and advanced analytics are great 
tools for reaching our sustainability 
goals, and it is equally important to 
have a sustainable and ethical 
approach when we work with AI. This 
is a high priority for us, and our work 
on sustainable and ethical AI is part 
of the overall vision of leading the 
change towards circular and renew -
able fashion while being a fair and 
equal company.
 
If you look ahead, what part do 
you think AI will play in the journey 
towards a circular business model? 
I think it is one of the most powerful 
tools we have in the transition towards 
a circular and sustainable fashion sys -
tem. With AI we can make sharper and 
better decisions that impact our world 
in a sustainable way.

The Global Change Award is one of 
the world’s biggest challenges for 
early-stage fashion innovation. Initiated 
by the non-profit H&M Foundation, 
it calls for ideas that accelerate the 
shift from a linear to a circular fashion 
industry. This means changing the way 
garments are designed and produced, 
shipped, bought, used, and recycled, 
by adding disruptive technology or 
new business models. 
With almost 15,000 entries from  
182 countries since its inception, the 
award is the go-to competition for 
circular innovation and has been  
called the Nobel Prize of fashion. 
The award’s five annual winners are 
selected by a panel of international 
experts. Amongst this year’s innovators 
was a company making sustainable 
bio-textiles by using left-overs from 
food crop harvests. As well as their 
share of the € 1,000,000 grant, winners 
are invited to an innovation acceler -
ator provided by H&M Foundation, 
Accenture and KTH Royal Institute of 
Technology in Stockholm, which offers 
focused support to further develop 
their innovations.
During the fourth year of Global 
Change Award, H&M Foundation kept 
an extra eye on digital innovation. 
“Digital innovations can make signifi -
cant impact on efficiency planning and 
resource use – all the way from making raw material to a garment’s end of 
life. Digitalization has the potential to 
disrupt at the root, reinvent how things 
are done and help producers, sellers 
and customers to become circular”, 
says Erik Bang, Innovation Lead, H&M 
Foundation. Neither the H&M Foundation nor H&M 
group take any equity or intellectual 
property rights in the innovations. The 
aim of the challenge is to find innova -
tions that allow major change for the 
entire industry, and the winners can 
collaborate with whomever they want.H&M Foundation’s Global Change Award

We are convinced that transparency is 
the foundation for gaining trust and 
building strong relationships – with 
our customers, colleagues, investors, 
business partners and other stakehold -
ers. That’s why we provide transparent 
information about our business and 
value chain through various channels 
and dialogues – this report being just 
one of them. By sharing our ambitions, 
challenges, solutions and progress in an 
open and honest way, we can collaborate 
more effectively with others, and gain 
mutual trust. 
However, we believe there is more to 
be done. We want all the players in our 
value chain to be able to make conscious 
and informed choices. That means we 
need to make it easier for consumers to 
understand where and how the products 
they buy have been made. It also means 
we need to create even greater traceabil -
ity in our value chain, and make impacts measurable and comparable across 
the industry. In this way, transparency 
becomes a key tool to lead the change 
towards a sustainable fashion industry.
We are working on transparency in two 
key areas:
1. TRANSPARENCY TO EMPOWER  
THE CUSTOMER’S CHOICE
We are committed to inspiring our cus -
tomers to make more sustainable choices. 
One way we can do that is by bringing 
the story behind the product closer to the 
customer, which means being transpar -
ent about exactly where and how it has 
been made, the materials used, and its 
social and environmental impacts. In 
recent years, we started sharing product 
stories for H&M’s Conscious Exclusive 
collection and ARKET’s regular assort -
ment. For some ARKET products, we also 
share the material supplier’s name. In 
2019, we will take this a step further and Transparency is the key to build trust and enable customers  
to make conscious choices. It is also an important driver for 
improved performance and creation of stronger impact across  
our value chain. Beyond disclosing where and by whom our 
products are made, we also work to make the impacts of how  
they are made measurable and comparable.Transparency
During 2018, a tight-knit team of sustain -
ability experts, IT architects, business 
developers and other experts from 
across H&M group has worked intensely 
to develop a solution through system 
integration and automation. Combin -
ing this solution with the results of our 
in-depth customer research, during 2019 
we will be offering the following in our 
online stores:
•  Information about each product’s mate -
rial, including how sustainable it is, and 
our specific sustainability goals for it.
•  Where each product is produced, down 
to a country, supplier and factory level.
•  Information about how to recycle the  
garment and why it is important to do so.
This function will be available for all our 
own textiles, footwear, and accessory 
products in our online store at H&M and 
H&M Home. Looking ahead, we want to 
see an industry standardised index for 
each product that makes it even easier 
for our customers to make sustainable 
choices. Helping our customers make conscious choices

Transparency information allows 
consumers to make more informed 
decisions about the impacts of the 
products they buy. If companies truly 
want to build sustainable businesses 
for the future, they need their custom -
ers to act more responsibly and sus -
tainably and that requires awareness, 
information and education. This is what 
consumer-facing transparency can do. 
Companies can literally help create 
better future customers.
How do you see H&M group’s role 
and performance in this area so far?
H&M was one of the first major brands to publish a list of its manufacturers 
and suppliers, a crucial step towards 
greater accountability. This information 
helps trade unions and other civil soci -
ety organisations to better understand 
where products are being made. H&M 
scores within the ten highest brands in 
our annual Fashion Transparency Index, 
and this shows that H&M is striving 
year-on-year to provide more informa -
tion about its sustainability policies, 
practices and impacts. We hope to see 
even more comprehensive, compa -rable, easy-to-use and verifiable data 
and information about H&M group’s 
practices and impacts in the future. We 
are excited to see transparency infor -
mation provided at the product level. 
This is a huge step forward, enabling 
customers to make more informed 
decisions about the products they buy 
from H&M. Hopefully in the future this 
sort of transparency will be available 
to consumers on every product they 
purchase from any brand or retailer,  
big or small.Enabling informed decisions through consumer-facing transparency
Sarah Ditty.make it possible for H&M and H&M  Home cus -
tomers to see more specific information for most 
of our products. This includes information such 
as in which factory a product was made and what 
materials were used to make it. 
Creating this transparency is a big and important 
step, but it doesn’t immediately show how sus -
tainable a product is. To answer this question, 
we need a common measurement for fashion 
products that allows consumers to compare in a 
simple and trusted way. This is why we have been 
involved in developing the Higg Index.
H&M group is one of the founding members of 
the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), an 
industry-  wide alliance that, among other activ -
ities, is developing the Higg Index – a tool to 
help create a more transparent and sustainable 
fashion industry. The Higg Index aims to score 
sustainability performance, making it easier for 
customers to benchmark brands, manufacturers 
and individual products so that they can make 
more sustainable choices.
Creating the required alignment within the 
fashion and design industry is taking longer 
than we expected. We have been pushing for this 
alignment from the beginning but, as with other 
collaborations, bringing many actors together is 
a significant challenge. Nevertheless, we are con -
fident that the Higg Index will become a trusted 
tool for consumers.H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201827 OF 109

• We were ranked in the top 5 of Fashion 
Revolution’s Fashion Transparency Index, 
scoring 55% (highest score 58%). While 
we acknowledge this recognition, we know 
there is more for us to do.
• Scaling our transparency work, we 
developed a solution that will provide our 
customers with sustainability information 
on products for H&M and H&M Home.
• We arranged a Transparency Hack in 
Los Angeles, USA, bringing together 
future generations, thought leaders and 
change-makers with tech, sustainability 
and fashion expertise for a day full of 
ideation sessions. The aim was to pres -
ent scenario solutions for a transparent 
fashion future. We believe that if we colla -
borate across the industry and use new 
technologies such as blockchain and AI, 
we can push the fashion industry towards 
becoming fully transparent.
• ARKET has conducted a pilot project to 
better understand the usage of blockchain 
in connection to transparency. Blockchain  
is a ledger or table that businesses use  
to keep track of their credit and debit. 
The distinguishing feature of block chain 
is that it cryptographically chains verified 
data into blocks. That means once info is 
added into the system it can’t be modified 
without everyone connected into the chain 
being informed.
LEARNINGS
• We are working hard to promote a con -
sumer-facing Higg Index so our customers 
can compare a product’s sustainability 
performance across brands. SAC has a diverse membership, each with their own 
commitments and timelines. While we are 
confident that the Higg index will deliver 
as a ground-breaking tool for transparency 
and comparability, we acknowledge that  
creating a common standard for so many 
actors takes time.• Over the years we have learned that it 
is very difficult to find solutions that suit 
customers’ needs for sustainability infor -
mation. There is currently little knowledge 
available on how exactly customers want 
further information. That is why, amongst 
other things, we are conducting further research to address this gap. H&M joined 
an insight study with several other fash -
ion brands in SAC to learn more about 
customer expectations in China, Europe 
and the US.

SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT IN  
SUPPLY CHAIN
In 2013, we were one of the first fash -
ion retailers to make our supplier list 
public. This list includes tier 1 manu -
facturing supplier factories for 100% 
of H&M group products and tier 2 
factories, which account for 65% of our 
products.  Creating greater traceability 
in our supply chain means knowing 
exactly where our products (and their 
materials) come from. One of the 
biggest challenges in creating greater 
traceability is collecting trusted data 
throughout our supply chain. We see 
that new emerging technologies such 
as blockchain can potentially help us 
tackle this challenge.
Mapping the apparel industry’s 
complex supply chains is both a joint 
effort and a groundbreaking and 
unparalleled initiative. Within the 
frame of SAC, the sharing of data for 
brands, textile manufacturers, mills 
and material suppliers’ locations and 
sustainability performance on a joint 
platform is a significant step towards 
public transparency. However, because 
of some unanimity issues within SAC 
membership, the timelines for devel -
oping a transparency platform for data 
sharing are somewhat delayed.
H&M group recently joined the Exec -
utive Board of SAC to further drive 
industry-wide transparency of the 
fashion and apparel industry. This is 
needed now more than ever, with the 
increased expectations from custom -
ers, stakeholders and legislators for transparent supply chains and dis -
closures on the impact on people and 
the planet. SAC’s Higgs Index creates 
a ‘common language’ for transparent 
product information, allowing compa -
rability across brands.
 PROGRESS
• H&M group signed the Transparency  
Pledge  and added more detailed 
information to our public supplier list. 
Our supplier list covers 100% of our 
tier 1 and 65% of our products with 
tier 2 suppliers. We have also added 
strategic tanneries this year.
• 100% of our tier 1 and tier 2 supplier 
factories* used the Higg Index Facility

customer interest and knowledge in 
sustainability and create positive 
behavioural change. In this way, we 
encourage our customers to re-wear, 
reuse and recycle unwanted clothes 
whenever possible.We believe it is important to encourage and empower 
sustainable actions throughout our value chain. Because we 
know incentives and reward systems help achieve long-term, 
positive behavioural changes, we are using them to engage 
our business partners, colleagues and customers to accelerate 
progress towards our sustainability vision.

abundance of natural resources. 
However, with global demand rapidly 
outstripping supply, the fashion 
industry cannot continue to operate 
as it has in the past. At H&M group, 
we believe that an industry-wide shift 
from a linear to a circular business 
model is the only solution.
Circular models maximise resources and 
minimise waste. Using the current linear 
model, less than 1% of material used to pro -
duce clothes across the industry is recycled 
into new products.* But in a circular model, 
resources stay in use for as long as possible 
before being regenerated into new products 
and materials, resulting in a reduction in 
waste and negative impacts. They also open 
for new business opportunities, such as our 
newly launched Take Care concept that offers 
products, services, inspiration, and guidance 
on expanding the life of garments (read more 
on page 49 ).
To fulfil our 100% Circular & Renewable 
ambition, we are building circularity into 
every stage of our value chain; from the prod -
ucts we design and make, to the packaging, 
materials and processes we use, to how our 100% Circular & Renewable explained
customers care for and dispose of our prod -
ucts. A business model can only be truly cir -
cular if it’s powered by renewable electricity, 
which is why we are planning to use 100% 
renewable electricity throughout our own 
operations. Ultimately, our goal is to achieve 
a climate positive value chain – a value chain 
that creates a net positive impact on the 
climate by 2040. 
Making fashion circular also presents a 
strong business case. By designing for circu -
larity, maximising resource use by working 
with recycled or other sustainably sourced 
materials, prolonging product lifespan and 
creating a climate positive value chain, we 
will increase the efficiency and the value of 
our operations and products. This will ena -
ble us to continue designing and producing 
great, sustainable products while creating 
positive social and environmental impacts.
To become 100% circular, we are focusing on 
five key stages within our value chain that 
are applicable to both commercial and non- 
commercial products:
A. Design
B. Material choice
C. Production processes
D. Product use

“ Collaboration and innovation are key to creating 
a fashion industry where clothes are used more 
and never become waste. As a core partner of 
Make Fashion Circular, and a brand with signif -
icant global presence, H&M group is playing an 
essential role in driving momentum towards this 
new vision for the industry.”
 Make Fashion Circular  (MFC) exists 
to drive the level of collaboration and 
innovation necessary to create a fash -
ion industry that can thrive in the future.
The group brings together leaders 
from a wide range of backgrounds, 
including brands, cities, philanthro -
pists, NGOs and innovators. H&M 
group is a core partner of MFC, which 
means we are collaborating with other 
core partners to lead the transition to 
a circular economy.
This year, MFC has created working 
groups to focus on new business 
models that increase clothing use, 
inputs that are safe and renewable, 
and solutions for turning used clothes 
into new ones. 
STRATEGIC TARGETS FOR  
SUSTAINABLE FASHION
H&M group is working strategically  
on sustainability, using science and 
partnerships to help us lead the  
change towards a circular and renew -
able fashion industry.  We are con -
tinuously developing new goals and 
roadmaps in all areas of our circular 
approach.
One example is our research project 
with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation 
and Stockholm University’s Stockholm 
Resilience Centre. The project, “A cir -
cular fashion industry within planetary 
boundaries”, is an ongoing collabo -
ration continuing through 2019. The 
project team is using a science-based 
approach to help H&M group and the 
wider industry set targets for a more 
sustainable fashion future.The project adopts a global perspective 
and incorporates the whole fashion 
value chain. It combines the principles 
of the circular economy from the Ellen 
MacArthur Foundation with the science 
of planetary boundaries from the Stock -
holm Resilience Centre.
The principles of a circular economy 
act as guidelines for how the fashion 
industry can thrive while remaining 
within the earth’s limits. That means 
designing out waste and pollution, 
keeping products and materials in use, 
and allowing nature to regenerate. Plan -
etary boundaries highlight the extent 
to which human activities can impact 
the environment without harming our 
planet’s critical ‘life support systems’. In 
other words, planetary boundaries mark 
the edges of the playing field while the 
circular economy shows us how to play.

We want to lead the change and take a 
holistic approach towards circular built 
environment, increasing our operational 
efficiency and the longevity of our stores 
and offices. To do this, we are developing 
a strategy that covers the whole value 
chain within our built environment. 
While we’re working on this, we continue 
to collaborate with suppliers and exter -
nal experts to identify and implement 
actions that can shift us from linear to 
circular stores and offices.
We have continued to work with the 
Ellen MacArthur Foundation to develop 
tools to assess the circularity of our 
non-commercial goods and suppliers. 
We have started the implementation 
and are continuing our work to achieve 
the already set goal, that at least 80% of 
new store concepts (H&M brand to begin 
with), should be circular by 2025.
For example, we recently rebuilt one of 
our H&M stores in Stockholm, Sweden, 
using mainly building materials and 
interiors from existing store materials, 
production samples or previous purchase 
leftovers. This shortened the lead-time 
along the entire value chain, maximised 
the value and use of the resources, and 
reduced our climate impact. We are cur -
rently looking into scaling this project.OUR PACKAGING STRATEGY
We take a holistic circular approach to 
packaging, taking all the stages of the 
value chain into account. Packaging, 
particularly when it’s made from plastic, 
has a big environmental impact – from 
raw materials, to manufacturing, to use 
and disposal. Our industry, as well as 
others, need to shift from a linear to  
a circular packaging model. Plastic 
packaging is front-of-mind for custom -
ers, colleagues and legislators, which 
means we have a good opportunity for 
rapid change in this area.
During 2018, H&M group collaborated 
with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to 
develop a circular packaging strategy that 
covers the reduction of packaging used, 
circular design, material use and re-use, 
and recycling systems. 
We want to lead the change in circular 
packaging, both for commercial and 
non-commercial goods, and have set  
the following goals:
• We have set a circular design goal that 
all packaging should be designed to  
be reusable, recyclable or com  postable  
by 2025.
• We will use 100% recycled and other 
sustainably sourced materials by  
year 2030.
• We will reuse or recycle 100% of packag -
ing waste from our own sites by 2025.
In addition to our circular packaging 
strategy, H&M group has signed the New  
Plastic Economy Global Commitment , developed between the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation and UN Environment. This 
represents a unique opportunity for busi -
nesses and governments to step forward 
as global leaders working on solutions 
that address the root cause of plastic 
waste and pollution. In the agreement, 
we commit to:
• Take action to eliminate problematic 
and unnecessary plastic packaging  
by 2025.  
• Take action to move from single-use 
towards reuse models where relevant 
by 2025.
• 100% of plastic packaging to be 
reusable, recyclable or compostable  
by 2025.

Circular design involves addressing the quality and 
durability of products, as well as their chemical 
input, materials and production processes. It also 
means finding ways to expand product lifespan, 
enabling better care and repair for our products 
and creating greater opportunities for rewear, reuse 
and recycling. We also apply circular design to our 
NCG (Non-Commercial Goods), such as packaging 
and stores, to increase their operational efficiency 
and longevity.
CIRCULAR GARMENT DESIGN
All H&M group brands have their own teams of 
designers and buyers. Having a circular approach 
in the design stage is crucial for creating circular 
products. Our designers are trained in choosing the 
right materials, which means choosing materials 
that are recycled or sustainably sourced and suited 
to longevity, reuse and recyclability.
We are continuing to develop our circular design 
strategy. During the past few years we have been uti -
lizing the latest technologies in 3D visualization of 
fabrics and products, which has lead to a reduction A. Design
Design is our first 
opportunity to bring 
circularity into our value 
chain. Incorporating 
circular thinking early on paves the 
way for later stages to follow suit.
PROGRESS
• We have set a circular design  
goal that all packaging should be 
designed to be reusable, recyclable  
or compostable by 2025.
• H&M group has signed up to the 
Global Fashion Agenda’s Circularity 
Commitment. This exists to encour -
age more companies in the fashion 
industry to support and practice the 
principles of circularity, including 
circular design goals. We continue to 
report progress on the Global Fashion 
Agenda Circularity Commitment.in sample rounds and use of resources. 
Now, designers are able to iterate on 
products in 3D, until they are sure it’s 
the right style. This removes the room 
for error both in designing the desired 
products for our customers, but also 
removes potential communication 
errors between us and factories.
COS: Repurposing cut offs through design
COS has always worked according to 
the principles of timeless, functional 
and considered design. This approach 
honours longevity and durability, and 
therefore translates well into circular 
thinking. Following the recent success 
of the capsule collection “10”, which 
focused on clever patternmaking and 
garment construction to reduce cut off 
waste, the brand launched the Repur -
posed Cotton Project.
Despite minimising cut offs as much 
as possible, COS knew there was still 
some high-quality cotton going to 
waste in their supply chain. Through 
the Repurposed Cotton Project, these cut offs are now collected, shredded, 
compacted, spun, knitted, dyed and 
constructed into sweatshirts. The recy -
cled cotton is blended with some virgin 
cotton to ensure its quality meets our 
customers’ high expectations.
COS used a new recycling supplier to 
process the fabric, but the sweatshirt 
itself is produced in the same factories 
and using the same high standards as 
all other COS garments. That means not 
only is this product made from recycled 
fabric, it is also durable by design. It’s 
early days, but the project could save 
up to 1.5 tonnes of cotton cuttings from 
going to waste every year.

Recycled materials are a win-win: they stop waste 
material from going to landfill and reduce the use 
of virgin raw materials (as well as chemicals, energy 
and water used to make them). Similarly, sustain -
ably  sourced bio-based materials are naturally 
grown or cultivated, and better from an environ -
mental perspective. 
We use third-party verified lifecycle assessment data 
to evaluate the sustainability credentials of recycled 
and sustainably sourced materials. This includes 
LCA data as well as external material benchmarks 
based on LCA data, such as the Material Sustaina -

We have specific sourcing policies for many of our 
raw materials. These typically require the use of 
credible third-party certification schemes to ensure 
sustainable sourcing, such as Organic and recycled 
standards, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 
and the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS).
We are collaborating with industry experts to 
ensure we successfully integrate recycled and 
sustainably sourced materials into our value chain. 
For example, we are working with Fashion Positive Our goal is to use 
100% recycled or other 
sustainably sourced 
materials by 2030 at the 
latest. In 2018, we achieved 57%.
Recycled materials
H&M group uses several types of recycled mate -
rials, including recycled cotton, polyester, nylon, 
wool, cashmere, plastic, silver and down. We are 
constantly working to increase our use of recycled 
materials. However, for many types of textiles, par -
ticularly blended fibres, viable recycling solutions 
either do not exist or are not commercially availa -
ble at scale.
To tackle this challenge, we are creating demand 
for solutions and working with scientists and 
innovators, including investments in Worn Again, 
Re:newcell and Moral Fiber, and engagement in, 
for example, DEMETO/GR3N, Fashion Positive 
PLUS and H&M Foundation’s Hong Kong Research 
Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA).PLUS, an initiative which seeks to identify, optimise 
and accelerate sustainable materials while making 
them widely available. So far, it has awarded grants 
to three recycling technology developers – Worn

• 57% of the materials used by H&M 
group were recycled or other sustain-
ably sourced. This is an increase from 
35% in 2017.
• We have set a goal to only use 
recycled or other sustainably sourced 
material for packaging by 2030.
• H&M group is the second biggest 
user of recycled cotton in the world, 
and the sixth biggest user of recycled 
polyester. This is according to The 
Textile Exchange’s Pre  ferred Fiber  
& Materials Market Report 2018.
• We used the equivalent of over 325 
million plastic PET bottles in our recy -
cled polyester.
• Several of our brands continued 
to replace conventional polyester 
and nylon with recycled alternatives. 
ARKET and H&M worked with a 100% 
regenerated nylon fibre material called 
Econyl®, while all Weekday swimwear 
was made from recycled nylon and 
recycled polyester.
• We used recycled silver to make 
jewellery in H&M’s Conscious Exclusive 
collection 2018. By recycling metals, we 
avoid the negative impacts of mining.
• We invested in Moral Fiber, an Ame -
rican innovation company developing 
a unique technology for polyester 
recycling.In 2016, the H&M Foundation 
and the Hong Kong Research 
Institute of Textiles and 
Apparel (HKRITA) formed a 
four-year partnership which, 
in 2017, led to a technological 
breakthrough. Using a hydro -
thermal method, HKRITA 
presented a solution for 
recycling cotton and polyes -
ter blends into new fibres. 
In autumn 2018, the H&M 
Foundation and HKRITA opened a recycling facility 
in Hong Kong, the first of its 
kind, putting the new tech -
nology into practice at scale. 
“This is a significant step 
towards a new fashion 
industry that operates within 
the planetary boundaries. As 
we scale up and make this 
technology freely available to 
the industry, we will reduce 
the dependence on limited 
natural resources to dress a growing global population,” 
says Erik Bang, Innovation 
Lead at H&M Foundation.
The H&M Foundation’s 
5.8 million euro projected 
investment in HKRITA has 
been made possible through 
the surplus from the H&M 
group’s in-store garment col -
lecting programs. The H&M 
Foundation allocates 50% of 
the total donated surplus to 
research on textile recycling.H&M Foundation launches ground-breaking

• H&M group is part of DEMETO , a 
research project for polyester recycling 
with an objective to build a pilot plant 
designed to treat about 500 tons of poly -
ester waste per year. The project is 
funded by the EU and its partners.*
LEARNINGS
• The use of any synthetic fibre creates 
the challenge of microfibre shedding. 
We are taking this very seriously and are 
looking for solutions. You can read more 
on page 48 .
• We want to further accelerate the use of 
recycled fibres in our products. However, 
to do this and to be able to recycle all 
fibre types and blends at scale we need 
more technological advancement in recy -
cling technologies. H&M group supports 
this development by investing and col -
laborating with innovators such as Worn 
Again, Re:newcell and H&M Foundation’s 
Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles 
and Apparel (HKRITA).

Our goal is to use 100% sustainably 
sourced cotton by 2020, which includes 
certified organic cotton, Better Cotton 
(BCI) and recycled cotton.
We are a founding partner of the Organic 
Cotton Accelerator (OCA) and are an 
active member of the board. The OCA was formed to tackle sector-wide challenges 
and accelerate the growth of the organic 
cotton market. In 2018, prototype-sourcing

MAN-MADE CELLULOSIC FIBRES  
(VISCOSE, RAYON, LYOCELL)
Man-made cellulosic (MMC) fibres are 
one of the world’s biggest group of fibres, 
and an important material group for us as 
well. MMC fibres include viscose, lyocell 
and modal, and are made by dissol  ving 
pulp, which today is mainly produced 
from wood. However, since the world’s 
forests face challenges such as forest 
depletion and deforestation, H&M group 
has engaged with others to push this 
industry in a more sustainable direction.
We are collaborating with the not-for-
profit group Canopy and more than 160 
other brands to eliminate the use of MMC KEY FACTS & FIGURES 2018 / KPIS AND GOALS /  100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE EXPLAINED  / BECOMING CLIMATE POSITIVE100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLEPROGRESS 
• According to the Textile Exchange’s 
Preferred Fiber & Materials Market Report 
2018, H&M group was the biggest user of 
preferred MMC fibres and the biggest user 
of preferred Lyocell.
• We released the updated version of  
our man   -made cellulosic sourcing policy  
in 2018.
• H&M group is committed to the  Changing 
Markets Roadmap  for responsible viscose 
and modal fibre manufacturing. The objec -
tive of the roadmap is for viscose and modal 
producers to move towards a closed-loop 
manufacturing system. By 2025 H&M group 
will only use viscose and other man-made 
cellulosic fibre producers with good 
environmental practices that align with the 
roadmap, such as closed-loop processing 
of water and chemicals. We are working to 
reduce the chemical intensity of viscose in 
partnership with the Zero Discharge of Haz -
ardous Chemicals (ZDHC) initiative. Please 
read more about this work in the chemical 
management section on page 42 .
• H&M group is one of the investors in 
TreeToTextile, a Swedish innovation com -
pany that is working with new technologies 
that use wood pulp to make textile fibres in 
an environmentally friendly way.
• H&M group has contributed to the devel -
opment of ForestMapper, a new public 
interactive tool that identifies ancient and 
endangered forests. ForestMapper was 
developed to support the marketplace in 
making responsible sourcing decisions.  
You can take a trip through the world’s 
forests here .WOOD-BASED MATERIALS 
H&M group depends on forests for many 
of our materials, including solid wood, 
man-made cellulosic (MMC) fibres, paper 
and board material. Forests make up 
some of the world’s largest and most 
important ecosystems; tropical rain -
forests cover less than 10% of the planet’s 
surface yet contain at least two-thirds of 
its biodiversity.
However, forests are rapidly being 
destroyed through illegal (or badly 
managed) logging and unsustainable 
land conversion. Responsible sourcing 
policies promote sustainable forest 
management practices and help combat 
illegal logging and deforestation. We 
commit to not source wood and forest 
materials from:
• Forests with threatened high  
conservation values (HCV)
• Forest areas that have been illegally 
harvested 
• Natural forests cleared for  
plantations or other use
• Forest areas where traditional  
or civil rights have been violated
We aim to exclude the above by increas -
ing our use of FSC (Forest Stewardship 
Council) certified materials, and by 
increasing our use of alternative fibre 
sources, such as agricultural residues 
and post-consumer textiles. These can 
work as replacements for wood fibre in, 
for example, man-made cellulosic materi -
als and paper.fibres sourced from ancient or endan -
gered forests and other controversial 
sources, and to replace them with sus -
tainably sourced alternatives. H&M group 
is one of the founding members of the 
 CanopyStyle Leader for Forest Conserva -
tion and has been actively working with 
the CanopyStyle initiative since 2014. 
This initiative is working to eliminate 
sourcing from ancient and endangered 
forests, as well as closing the loop for tex -
tiles and supporting the development of 
alternative MMC fibres made from more 
innovative sources, such as agricultural 
residues and recycled textiles.
In our MMC sourcing policy (updated 
end of 2018), we commit that by the end 
of 2020, 100% of our man-made cellu -
losic fibres will be sourced from low risk 
suppliers that have completed Canopy -
Style audits and attained a “green shirt” 
in the Hot button report*. This means 
they will indicate a low risk of sourcing 
from ancient and endangered forests. By 
the end of 2025, all H&M group MMC 
fibres will come from either FSC certified 
forests or from other, more sustainable 
and innovative sources, such as agricul -
tural residues or post-consumer textiles.
WOOL
Although wool represents a small share 
of our total material use, it is still an 
important fibre and has benefits that 
are currently hard to replace. Our goal 
is that, by 2022, we will only source our 
virgin wool from farms certified to the 
Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) .

LEATHER
We are continuously working towards  
a more transparent leather supply 
chain. Even though leather stands for a 
very small fraction of our total material 
use, we want all the animal-derived 
leather we use to come from sources 
we know are proactively addressing 
their environmental, social and animal 
welfare impacts.  
ARKET, one of the first brands 
in the world to introduce 
Responsible Wool Standard  
 in their collection.
PROGRESS
• 100% of our tier 1, 2 and 3 suppliers 
have been briefed on the new RWS.
• ARKET became one of the first brands 
in the world to introduce the Responsible 
Wool Standard in their collection.
LEARNINGS
• Industry challenges and lack of trace -
ability and transparency in the mohair 
supply chain made us act decisively. PETA 
revealed systematic animal abuse in the 
mohair industry in May 2018. We stopped 
buying products containing mohair in mid-
2018 and by 2020, we will have phased 
out mohair completely.
• While cashmere is popular for its soft 
texture and known as a high-quality mate -
rial, it comes with both environmental and 
animal welfare challenges. As part of our 
2030 goal to only use sustainably sourced 
materials, we have decided to gradually 
phase out conventional cashmere and 
replace it with more sustainable options 
with similar high value for our customers.This will ensure we only source wool 
fibres from farms that respect animals 
and the environment.We have teamed up with other brands and 
organisations to work together for a more 
sustainable leather supply chain. This 
includes working with the Responsible 
Leather Round  table, driven by the Textile 
Exchange, the Leather Working Group 
and its sub-group on animal welfare.
We are systematically working to inte -
grate tanneries into our social and envi -
ronmental sustainability assessments. 
During 2018 we have further reinforced 
our sustainability commitment for 
leather products, putting the focus on 
chrome-free solutions for the coming 
years. By 2025, all our animal-based 
leather will be chrome-free and originate 
from more sustainable sources.
However, because leather has so many sus -
tainability challenges – from farm level up 
to finished product – we are also focused 
on finding more sustainable non-animal 
leather alternatives made using plants and 
other bio-based materials. We are increas -
ingly optimistic about the potential of 
these innovative alternatives.
OTHER SUSTAINABLY SOURCED  
MATERIALS
All the virgin down we use in our prod -
ucts comes from farms certified to the 
Responsible Down Standard (RDS). In 
2018, we also introduced recycled down 
and feathers into our products, which 
is collected from post-consumer goods. 
According to the Textile Exchange’s 
2018 Preferred Fiber Market Report, 
H&M group is the world’s largest user 
of preferred down, which includes both 
RDS certified, and post-consumer  
recycled down.H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201842 OF 109HOW WE REPORT STANDARDS & POLICIES 100% FAIR & EQUAL OVERVIEW 100% LEADING THE CHANGE VISION & STRATEGYKEY FACTS & FIGURES 2018 / KPIS AND GOALS /  100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE EXPLAINED  / BECOMING CLIMATE POSITIVE100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE
CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT
To ensure the safe use and reuse of materials 
in the circular system, we must ensure good 
chemical management. Our vision is to lead the 
change towards safe products and a toxic-free 
fashion future.
In 2018, we started the process to adopt 
Screened Chemistry to enable us to select the 
best available chemicals for our production. 
Screened Chemistry goes beyond Restricted  
Substance List /Manufacturing Restricted Sub -
stance List chemicals and identifies best-in-class 
chemicals and safer alternatives. It includes a hazard-based scoring system to rate chemi -
cals and formulations based on human health 
and environmental toxicity, and automatically 
designs hazardous substances out. This is a 
prerequisite for circular economy.
We have also re-launched a Positive List 
of chemicals that we promote throughout 
our supply chain. This Positive List will be 
included in the Zero Discharge of Hazard -
ous Chemical (ZDHC) Gateway, as a web-based 
industry platform to choose the best chemi -
cals. We are working to align all the tools and 
standards within the fashion industry, which 
will help achieve our goal of zero discharge. 
By 2030, all products on our Positive List 
should be assessed by their hazard to secure 
our vision for a toxic-free fashion future.
We have continued to work alongside other 
brands and stakeholders on the ZDHC pro -
gramme, raising awareness and developing 
shared industry standards and tools.
Using recycled materials is a key element in 
the circular economy. However, increasing 
the use of recycled materials while staying 
toxic-free presents a challenge. We have there -
fore initiated mapping of textile waste streams 
and assessing chemicals. In this way, we can 
make sure that textiles containing hazardous 
substances are not allowed to re-enter the pro -
duction cycle. Sustainable production 
processes are central 
to circular systems. In 
the fashion and design 
industry, we rely on water and 
chemicals in most of our production 
processes. To achieve sustainable 
production and our larger 100% 
Circular & Renewable ambition, 
we must address our chemical and 
water management, and tackle the 
microfibre challenge that comes from 
using synthetic fibres.C. Sustainable production

stated, “the world is not on track to achieve the global  
SDG  6 targets by 2030 at the current rate of progress”.   
With 2.3 billion people lacking basic sanitation services, 
along with worsening worldwide water pollution, we are 
resolved to push harder for action and progress on this 
issue, both within our value chain and beyond.
H&M group has been working to reduce water impacts 
throughout our value chain for over ten years. We began a 
long-term partnership with WWF in 2011, with the goal of 
becoming a leading water steward within the fashion indus -
try. With the help of WWF, we developed a five-step water 
stewardship strategy.
During World Water Week in 2018, H&M group and  
WWF called for action from the textile and apparel  
industry to join forces with stakeholders, governments, 
development partners, wider industry and water users  
to find solutions to today’s water-  related challenges in 
basins where we operate.
OUR WATER STEWARDSHIP STRATEGY
H&M group’s water stewardship strategy takes an innova -
tive and integrated approach, going beyond factory lines to 
address large scale, local, environmental and social impacts 
across our whole supply chain.
In 2018, we revised our Water Management requirements 
for suppliers. This meant raising the bar for functional efflu -
ent treatment plants and requiring the measurement and 
tracking of water streams for efficiency and benchmarking.Water management
Our 5-step water stewardship strategy
1. WATER AWARENESS 
Building water awareness at our 
company, at our suppliers’ facto -
ries and amongst our customers 
to ensure high level understanding 
of the global water challenges and 
their dependence on freshwater.
2. KNOWLEDGE OF IMPACT 
Measuring water impact and risk 
within our stores, warehouses and 
suppliers’ factories.
3. INTERNAL ACTION 
Improving the use of water within 
our stores, warehouses and our 
suppliers’ factories.4. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Increased focus on collective action 
with other companies, governments 
and NGOs in multi-stakeholder 
platforms to address water issues 
in specific focus regions.

we launched our new Water roadmap for our supply 
chain, which contains our key goals and actions up 
until 2022. It addresses the water-related challenges 
we face around the world in a way that puts our 
industry, and others, on the right path to SDG6, to 
“ensure availability and sustainable management of 
water and sanitation for all”.
The roadmap represents a paradigm-shifting move 
towards integrated water management that values 
water as a shared resource. For example, we set an 
ambitious goal to recycle 15% of wastewater back 
into production processes by 2022. We have started 
to use five new water recycling solutions for tex -
tile and apparel production processes, which will 
improve the quality and create opportunities for 
water recycling in many of our production countries.
H&M group operates in many medium-to-high risk 
water basins where challenges vary from water 
scarcity to water pollution. We have assessed the 
risk of our suppliers’ production facilities with the 
WWF Water Risk Filter and integrated the neces -
sary actions and goals in our roadmap. We have also

• We have assessed all onsite industrial Efflu -
ent Treatment Plants (ETP) in our value chain 
and worked with our suppliers to secure 
appropriate technology, operational control 
and high levels of relevant competence.  
We now have 93% functional ETPs in our 
supply chain.
• Our current rate of compliance with ZDHC 
wastewater standard for conventional 
parameters is 87%.
• We trained all our tier 1 and tier 2 facilities 
on Higg FEM 3.0. This supported them in 
making self-assessment of their environ -
mental performance. We also rolled out our 
Towards Circular & Renewable training for 
facilities, which includes capacity building 
on cleaner production with a focus on water, 
energy and chemicals.
• Our work with resource efficiency and 
cleaner production programmes has  
continued to help our suppliers to reduce 
their water consumption. In 2018 our efforts 
projected water consumption reduction by 
4.7 million m 3.
• We also encourage our suppliers to use a 
rain water harvesting system to efficiently 
capture, store and use natural water sources 
whenever feasible. In 2018, our partner 
Hamza Textiles Ltd in Bangladesh harvested 
18.9 million litres of rain water.
• We have further improved our understanding 
of where the water in our supply chain comes 
from. 38% of water comes from the ground, 
5% from surface water, 52% from municipal 
water, 5% from Produce /Process Water. (Self 
reported data Higg FEM 3.0 in 2018).• 30.8% of our denim products have 
achieved a green level EIM (Environmental 
Impact Measurement), which means they 
used a maximum of 35 litres of water per 
garment during the treatment processes.
• We have installed water-efficient equip -
ment in 64% of our own stores, offices and 
distribution centres. Our goal is to install 
water-efficient equipment across all our 
operations by 2020.
• Our partnership with WWF contributed 
to bringing in more global fashion brands 
to the WWF water stewardship program  
in Taihu, China. The first standardized  
supplier training material was digitized  
and implemented for suppliers in autumn 
2018.
LEARNINGS
• In many countries where we operate,  
water is not considered as a valuable, natural 
resource. This lowers awareness and creates 
a perception that water is dispensable. We 
are supporting the Bangladesh govern -
ment’s Water Valuation Study to develop an 
operational shadow price for water, so its 
value can be considered in policy, projects 
and investment decisions in the public and 
private sector.
• Many countries lack the required innova -
tion to provide solutions for reducing water 
consumption. Processes for washing and 
dyeing textiles still depend on water as a 
carrier, and often require huge volumes of 
water. Newer technology and innovation can 
significantly reduce water usage in textile 
processing. We are exploring new recycling 
techniques for textile processes with more 
efficient water consumption.• Most existing water management plat -
forms work in silos, making it much more 
challenging to reach common industry goals. 
The many organisations working to improve water management means there are both 
gaps and overlaps. If we could join forces, 
it would help us align and use available 
resources more effectively.

production in the 
Büyük Menderes 
basin
Water facilities often require 
financial support to adopt 
cleaner production processes. In 
many basins where we oper -
ate, such financial mechanisms 
are either absent or not pro -
moted. Providing easy access 
to finance increases resource 
efficiency and maximises profit 
for the facility. Between 2017 
and 2018, we worked with WWF 
to promote cleaner production 
in the Büyük Menderes river 
basin in Turkey. This involved 
engaging relevant ministries 
and industrial bodies, as well 
as contributing with training 
programmes, feasibility studies, 
favourable financing programmes 
and knowledge-boosting activ -
ities for programme partici -
pants. Through this project, we 
are facilitating financing options 
for the textile facility so they can 
adopt cleaner production tech-
niques in their production.
In May 2018, several major 
brands emphasised the impor -
tance of cleaner production 
to their global supply chains 
at a textile engagement event. 
This was followed by a Cleaner 
Production Guideline launch in 
September 2018.“We will continue our work in the 
Büyük Menderes region and scale 
to the heart of the textile indus -
try in Turkey, the Ergene region, 
during 2019. Other companies will also join us, which is excel -

MICROFIBRES 
When synthetic fabrics like polyester, nylon and acrylic 
are washed, they release microfibres into the water 
system, which disturbs natural ecosystems. Each year, 
approximately 500,000 tonnes of microfibres – the 
equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles – enter the ocean 
as a result of clothes-washing.*
H&M group is highly concerned about the environmental 
impact of microfibres and is engaged in driving research 
and contributing to a global solution, together with many 
others in the fashion and design industry. The issue 
of microfibres needs to be addressed at several stages 
throughout the value chain, including design, produc -
tion, usage and end-of-life. We are also investigating our 
own synthetic textiles to see how the fibre composition 
sheds during the washing process. This way, we will be 
able to see if we can make any adjustments in the making 
of the fibres to reduce the shedding.  PROGRESS 
• We joined the Swedish research 
group RISE in their project MinShed , 
which aims to find methods of 
designing clothes with minimized 
microfibre shedding. Testing and 
evaluation of fabrics to find param -
eters that affect the shedding 
behavior is currently in progress. 
Through MinShed, we also support 
an investigation to understand 
how and if washing machines can 
be equipped with filters to reduce 
microfibre emissions. Read more 
about MinShed here .• We are developing a research pro -
gramme to create a better under -
standing of how and where to best 
reduce microfibre emissions in tex -
tile production. The purpose of this 
programme is to study microplastics 
generation and management in the 
textile production processes.  
This covers polyester, recycled poly -
ester, nylon, and acrylic.
• We have added laundry bags that 
specialize in filtering microfibres to 
the assortment and are rolling this 
initiative out to more and more mar -kets. Microfibre-reducing laundry 
bags aim to prevent the release of 
microfibres into the water system 
during the wash. We recognize this 
is a short term solution, and more 
robust system solutions must be 
developed for the long term.
• We are closely monitoring the 
development of alternative bio-de -
gradable fibres that potentially could 
be used as alternatives for today’s 
synthetic fibres.

We can prolong the lifespan of our 
products and create a truly circular 
system by designing durable prod -
ucts and empowering our custom -
ers to care for and use the products 
in a sustainable way.
CUSTOMER USE
We encourage our customers to 
make sustainable choices while 
using our products. We do this by 
providing information about gar -
ment care, encouraging custom -
ers to use products for as long as 
possible and offering opportuni -
ties for reuse and recycling, rather 
than disposal. For many years, our 
garments have had the Clevercare 
label included in their washing 
instructions. This encourages 
washing at lower temperatures 
and hang drying instead of tum -
ble drying. Simple behavioural 
changes like this can dramatically reduce the environmental impact 
of our products after they leave 
our store, as well as increasing 
their overall lifespan.
Now we have taken further steps 
to create more products with 
emotional durability through 
H&M’s Take Care concept, Mon -
ki’s Re:Love event and Weekday’s 
in-store workshop. Read more on 
these initiatives on page 51 .Circular products stay in use as long as 
possible before they are recycled. For most 
products, a major part of the lifespan is with 
their owner. We have a responsibility to 
ensure we create long-lasting products and that we help 
our customers keep them for longer.Our Take Care concept inspires 
and enables our customers in 
caring for their fashion favourites 
– from the moment they leave the 
store with their new clothes up 
to the time they bring them back 
for reuse and recycling. Because 
21% of the climate impact in a 
garment ’s life occurs after it has 
left the store, we want to help 
our customers keep their clothes 
fresh and prolong their life. The 
Take Care concept does this by 
offering guidance and hands-on 
support for smart repairs and 
easy modifications. We also offer 
a range of products to support 
this behaviour change, including 
eco-friendly detergents, sewing 
kits, deco-patches and innovative 
washing bags that collect micro -
fibres, to mention a few.
During 2019 we will roll out the 
Take Care concept to more mar -
kets. Several brands in the H&M 
group have ongoing initiatives 
similar to the Take Care concept, 
personalized to their customers 
Take Care concept expands to more markets

• After the initial pilot project in 
Germany we launched the Take

Product reuse & recycling
At H&M group, we work 
hard to increase the 
number of our products 
that are reused or recycled.  
We run renewal and remake projects, 
turning old clothes into new fashion 
favourites through reprinting, re  -
purposing and remaking.  
We also continue to collect unwanted 
clothes and home textiles from our 
customers through our garment 
collection initiatives. In 2016, H&M 
brand set a goal to collect 25,000 
tonnes of unwanted clothes annually 
by 2020. In 2018, we collected over 
20,649 tonnes.
We started collecting unwanted textiles (from any 
brand, in any condition) in H&M stores in 2012 in 
Switzerland, rolling out the initiative globally in 
2013. We also offer the service in all & Other Stories, 
Monki and selected Weekday stores. & Other Stories 
also offers instore collection and recycling of beauty 
product containers. Our new brand Afound offers 
collection service not only for garments, but also 
shoes. We collaborate with I:CO  (a global 
partner for collection, reuse and recy -
cling of used textiles and shoes) to run 
our garment collecting scheme. I:CO 
and their partners sort all collected 
textile and shoes according to the 
EU Waste Hierarchy which promotes 
reuse before recycling.
About 50–60%* of the textiles are 
sorted for re-wear or reuse: wearable 
pieces are kept in their current con -
dition and marketed as second hand 
garments. Some are even used to create 
new products in both regular and spe -
cial collections for H&M group brands.
About 35–45%* of the textiles are 
recycled to become products for other 
industries or made into new textile 
fibres. For example, some textiles are 
used to make cleaning cloths. Other 
textiles are mechanically shredded 
into fibres and used to make insula -
tion materials or painters’ drop cloths. 
During this process, buttons and 
other hard materials are sorted out. 
Even the dust, which is left over from 
shredding is kept and used for felt 
board production. 
A still rather small share of the 
recyclable textiles is also recycled *Sorting results vary due to geographical and seasonal changes.Please find an independent assurance statement related to our

We are constantly working to 
increase the share of textile-to- 
textile recycled materials in our 
products. As new recycling technol -
ogies become available at scale, we 
will be able to create more prod -
ucts from the post-  consumer waste 
we collect via our garment collect -
ing scheme. This will help us reach 
our goal to use only 100% recycled 
or other sustainably sourced mate -
rials by 2030.into new textile fibres and yarns 
for our closed loop collections. This 
is something we want to change 
and dramatically increase through 
investing and engaging in solutions 
for scalable recycling technologies 
available for all types of textile fibres 
and blends. The remaining 3–7%* 
that can’t be reused or recycled are 
used as combustibles for energy pro -
duction. Sending textiles to landfill 
is not an option.
Used clothing and shoes are sorted for reuse 
and recycling at I:CO’s partner facility plants.

brought old Monki favourites and 
customised them for free with 
graphics, stickers and prints.
WEEKDAY  launched the Week -
day Workshop in August 2018, a 
mini manufacturing hub inside the 
store in Stockholm. Customers 
were offered production on-  
demand of local trends, testing 
new designs before producing 
in bulk, and replenishing stock 
on the fly – all in all reducing the 
amount of unsold products and 
increasing accuracy to demand. 
The workshop also invited 
Weekday customers to co-create 
products with prints to their liking. 
After the success of the work -
shop, Weekday is scaling up to 
nearshore facilities that make use 
of new printing, embroidery and 
custom fit technologies, all part of 
a circular production innovation 
plan. We’ve seen in research, if a 
customer is part of the process of 
creating their product, it is more 
likely that the product will last longer in their wardrobes and be 
worn more frequently. Weekday ’s 
experiment has proved success -
ful: customers become more 
interested in how products are 
made and are eager to be part of 
new experiences, like printing in 
store and on-demand production. 
This initiative has resulted in per -
manent printing services in one of 
Weekday ’s stores in Stockholm.
CHEAP MONDAY  launched their 
yearly C/O collection for AW18, 
which in this capsule creates new 
products by upcycling workwear. 
The collection consists of jackets, 
work chinos, t-shirts, sweats and 
a shopper bag, all made from 
discarded workwear with that 
sought-after worn look. The pro -
ject aims to shift the context from 
workwear to fashion, rescuing the

Waste, particularly product waste, is 
an emerging topic in our industry. We 
believe one product going to waste is one 
too many, whether that’s after customer 
use or before. We have a strict policy in 
place that prohibits the destruction of 
any products that could be sold, used 
or recycled. We naturally want to avoid 
any overstock; it’s in our interest to sell 
everything we produce. We put a lot 
of time and effort into forecasting the 
demand of our customers as accurately as 
possible, which involves using advanced 
AI tools. If we plan incorrectly, we will 
discount a product and sell it, but we will 
never destroy it.
We also apply very strict quality require -
ments to all our products. If, despite 
preventive measures, a product is made 
that does not meet these quality require -
ments, we have a responsibility not to sell 
it. When this happens, we either give the 
product to charity or recycle it. The same 
goes for samples or any damaged or faulty 
products returned to us by our customers. 
There are very rare instances in which a 
product cannot be sold, given to charities 
or recycled. This is the case if a product 
has failed certain chemical tests, has been 
contaminated by mould, for example, 
during transportation or when there is no 
viable recycling or downcycling solution 
available. In those rare cases the product 
unfortunately can’t be reused, donated to 
charities or recycled.
We work preventively to minimize any 
such instances wherever possible and to 
accelerate new recycling technologies that 
can handle these challenges.However, if they occur, we follow a strict ban 
on landfill. Due to lack of solutions and to 
keep the risk of circulating unsafe materi -
als to an absolute minimum, such products 
unfortunately have to be destroyed (prioritiz -
ing incineration for energy recovery where 
possible).
STORE & DISTRIBUTION CENTRE WASTE 
We focus on managing the most common 
forms of waste within our stores and distri -
bution centres (DCs) – cardboard, plastic and 
paper. These materials are usually collected 
in our stores and then sent to our local DC 
facilities for recycling. We occasionally face 
a challenge when a country or region does 
not have the necessary recycling systems 
available. In 2018, the share of stores that 
had enough recycling systems for our waste 
equated to 63%. This indicates a decrease 
from last year’s result (2017: 64%), which can 
be attributed to improved data collection.
In 2018, 92% of waste originating in our DCs 
and waste delivered to our DCs from stores 
was recycled compared to 93% in 2017. Our 
aim is to recycle 100% of the waste collected 
in all our stores and 95% of waste originating 
or delivered to our DCs.
PRODUCTION WASTE
In 2018, H&M group started developing a 
strategy that focuses on the management of 
waste generated by our group’s supplier fac -
tories. Over the next two years, we aim to set 
goals and roadmaps that will help in man -
aging the waste resources through reduc -
tion, reuse and recycling. In 2019, we will 
focus on waste sources and waste disposal, 
and continue to evaluate options for waste 
recovery in the different production markets 
we operate.WASTE MANAGEMENT WITHIN  
OUR OWN OPERATIONS
To make sure we operate in a truly circu -
lar way, we always aim to reuse or recy -
cle the waste generated within our own 
operations. During 2018, we rolled out 
Sustainable Workplace Standard (SWS). 
SWS is our commitment to create the best 
possible sustainable working environment 
in our offices, distribution centres and 
stores, such as waste management and 
recycling. The other categories within 
waste management are faulty products 
and store and distribution centre waste.  PROGRESS
• With our newly created brand Afound, 
we use a new business model that gives 
unsold fashion new life by selling overstock, 
both from H&M group brands as well as 
over 100 external brands.
• We collected 20,649 tonnes of garments 
through our garment collecting initiatives. 
This is an increase of 16% from last year, 
meaning we have achieved our 2018 goal.
LEARNING
• Mechanical recycling techniques are 
advancing, but are restricted as to which 
fibres they can be used for and how the 
fibres are affected by the process. We know 
it takes time for new recycling techno -
logies to scale and are therefore involved in 
research projects such as DEMETO and H&M 
Foundation’s Hong Kong Research Institute 
of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA), to support 
breakthroughs and make solutions more 
mainstream. Through H&M group’s invest -
ments in Worn Again, Re:newcell and Moral

Becoming circular and climate 
positive are closely linked. 
Climate change remains one  
of the greatest challenges of  
our time. Its consequences  
will affect our entire planet  
and everyone living on it.  
To tackle the challenge of 
climate change, we need to 
collaborate across sectors. 
For example, by creating  
energy-efficient products and 
services, sustainable and 
innovative material use, and 
improvements in supply chains.

We at H&M group are determined to 
take the lead in tackling the challenge of 
climate change. That means going way 
beyond simply cutting our emissions, 
committing instead to make a significant 
contribution to help our planet stay below 
the 2°C global warming limit as set by the 
Paris Climate Agreement. In addition, a 
recent landmark report by the UN Inter -
governmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) described how we must stay below 1.5°C of warming to avoid the worst 
impacts of climate change and called for 
all sectors to hasten the transition to  
climate neutral or positive operations.
We have set an ambitious goal to become 
climate positive by 2040, which includes 
everything from raw materials to the 
consumers’ use of our products. It means 
removing more emissions from the atmos -
phere than our value chain emits. We don’t yet have all the solutions we will need to 
achieve this goal, but the urgency of immi -
nent climate change means we must start 
taking bold, decisive action now. Together 
with the help of expert scientific organisa -
tions and the WWF Climate Savers, we have 
identified three key priorities for action.
• Priority 1 focuses on leadership in energy 
efficiency to enable us to use as little 
energy as possible.• Priority 2 tackles our 100% renewable 
energy goal, which will help us to ensure 
the energy sourced by H&M group and our 
supply chain is renewable.
• Priority 3 targets climate resilience and 
carbon sinks to address unavoidable 
emissions and emissions beyond what our 
value chain is responsible for. These three 
priorities relate to both our own opera -
tions and those across our value chain.H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201854 OF 109

either own or have direct control over.
Scope 2 emissions:  are defined as “indirect” emissions created from the 
consumption of purchased electric -
ity. Purchased electricity is defined 
as electricity that is bought or other -
wise brought into the organisational 
boundary of the company.
Scope 3 emissions:  are defined as 
any emissions that are produced out -side of our own operations and that 
we therefore have indirect control 
over. This includes our suppliers and 
the producers of raw materials used 
in our products, as well as emissions 
from the use of products, for exam -
ple when our customers use washing 
machines to wash their clothes.OUR KEY COMMITMENTS
Besides the efforts across our value chain to reach 
our climate positive goals, we are also engaging with 
other actors within the industry and beyond in driv -
ing policy change, by adopting science-based targets 
and committing to global climate reduction goals:
SBTs  As testament to H&M group’s leadership, and 
as an important milestone on the journey towards 
becoming climate positive by 2040, our science  -
based targets aligned with the Paris agreement have 
been approved by the Science Based Targets  
initiative (SBTi) . H&M group commits to reduce 
absolute GHG emissions 40% in our own operations 
(scope 1 + 2) by 2030. H&M group also commits to 
reduce scope 3 GHG emissions from raw materials, 
fabric production and garment manufacturing 59% 
per product by 2030. Both targets are set against a 
2017 baseline.
TCFD  H&M group has publicly endorsed the Task  
force on Climate Related Disclosure (TCFD) and 
aims to comply with its recommendations. We are in 
the process of analysing our climate risks according 
to the TCDF guidelines and will follow the recom -
mendations for disclosure.
UNFCCC  We are a signatory of the Fashion Industry  
Charter on Climate Action initiated by UNFCCC. 
The UNFCCC’s Fashion Industry Charter for Cli -
mate Action is an industry-wide collaboration to set 
a decarbonization pathway for the fashion industry, 
complementing and supporting other fashion sector 
initiatives, and aimed at increasing climate action.
Policy Push  Through a series of seminars, meetings 
and correspondence, together with IKEA Group, 
WWF and RE100, we informed the European  
Parliament and the Council about the importance 
of high ambitions in The Clean Energy for All

*Climate impacts are based on a scope 3 assessment done by Ecofys in 2017, based 
on 2016 data. The categories are based on GHG Protocol. Calculations in the footprint 
analysis are based on calculations on a combination of high-quality H&M group 
data combined with the best available public data sources on CO 2 emissions, using 
conservative assumptions. We are working to further improve the calculations by using 
primary data from our main suppliers.
** GHG Protocol Category 1: Purchased products.
*** Including fuel & energy related activities (0,1%), employee commuting (0,2%), 
business travel (0,4%), waste generated in operations (0,02%), franchises (0,1%).
What are scopes?*Our GHG emissions accounting and reporting is aligned with the GHG protocol.  
Scope 2 emissions under the market-based approach is equal to 45,160 tonnes 
CO2 e. Under the location-based approach (using grid average emission factors), 
comparable to emission figures in our 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017 reports, 
scope 2 emissions were 662,739 tonnes. For further details and data, please 
see our CDP Climate Change Investor Response 2018. CO 2e emissions include

Leadership in energy efficiency
We need different approaches to energy 
efficiency in different parts of our value chain. 
We have a varying level of control over energy 
efficiency across our value chain, with greater 
control over some parts than others. Despite 
this, we are committed to increasing energy 
efficiency at all stages of our value chain by 
optimising maximum possible energy output 
from the smallest, necessary energy input.
OUR STORES  
We have a primary focus on improving 
energy efficiency in our stores, because – with 
over 4,968 stores – our bricks-and-mortar 
portfolio accounts for the majority of H&M group’s own electricity consumption. We 
have increased our store energy goal from 
a 20% reduction in electricity intensity by 
2020 to 25% by 2030. With 2016 figures as 
our baseline, we are measuring this by taking 
into account the amount of electricity used 
per square metre of sales area and opening 
hours. Our store energy management strategy 
targets improvements in lighting and HVAC 
(heating, ventilation, air-  conditioning), which 
accounts for 90% of the electricity we use in 
our stores. By putting more specific demands 
on HVAC systems and replacing HID with 
LED lighting systems, we are confident that 
by 2030 every store we construct will use 40% 
less energy per square metre and opening 
hour than those we constructed in 2016. • We are gradually replacing all existing 
lighting with LED, while phasing out 
high-intensity discharge (HID) lighting.
• We have made substantial energy 
savings in the US and Poland. In 2017 and 
2018, the US saw decreases of around 
5% both years; Poland has decreased 
by 20% over the last five years. These 
results have mainly come from replacing 
older HVAC units with newer technology 
and focusing on building management 
steering.H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201856 OF 109

We work to reduce energy emissions in several ways 
within our transport and distribution centre opera -
tions. We monitor our own energy consumption 
and ensure that our distribution centre operations 
and logistics are as energy efficient as possible.
We work with transport companies and ensure 
we use the most energy-efficient options where 
possible. This involves optimising routes, as well 
as looking at energy efficient vehicles and alterna -
tive fuel options. Transport represents 2% of our 
emissions and, with a growing online business, this 
is becoming an important focus area for reducing 
our impact.
We are members of the Clean Shipping Network, 
Clean Cargo Working Group, Green Freight Asia and Network for Transport Measure Path -
ways Coalition. We are also working 
with the Global Logistics Emissions 
Council (GLEC) to support work to 
find a global standard that accurately 
measures logistics-derived emissions.
PROGRESS
• We formed a transport coalition with 
Scania, Eon and Siemens called the 
Pathways Coalition. Its vision is to create 
fossil-free heavy commercial transport 
by 2050 or earlier, in line with the Paris 
Agreement. The group aims to acceler -
ate decarbonisation of heavy transport 
and increase electrification. By collabo -
rating across sectors, we can speed up 
the pace of change and form a louder 
voice for advocacy and leadership.
• We hosted our second Global Logis -
tics Sustainability Week. The event 
aims to engage our logistics and dis -
tribution centre teams in our sustaina -
bility work and raise awareness about 
the importance of improving energy 
efficiency, reducing CO 2 emissions for 
transport, improving waste recycling 
and reuse, and collecting unwanted 
garments. 80% of distribution centres 
participated, 12.7 tons of garments 
were collected.
LEARNING
• Increased air shipments in some of 
our markets in Southeast Asia due to 
expansion to new geographical areas, 
has caused our upstream air trans -
port emissions to increase. We are 
concerned about this and will look for 
other ways to distribute our garments 
in these areas.
4.9. CO2e EMISSIONS IN KILO TONNES   
FROM UPSTREAM TRANSPORT AND BUSINESS TRAVEL *Pathways Coalition.
*Please find an independent assurance statement related to GRI 305-3 on page 
106 . Reported scope 3 emissions include energy use, goods transport and 
distribution, and business travel. CO 2e emissions include carbon dioxide (CO 2), 
methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), hydroflourocarbons (HFCs), perflourocarbons 
(PFCs) and sulphur hexaflouride (SF 6). Increase in emissions from transport is 
mainly related to an increase in air freight. Emission data from previous years was 
likely underreported and actual historic emission data is unavailable.OUR SUPPLIERS
Our goal is to create a climate neutral 
supply chain for our tier 1 and tier 
2 suppliers by 2030. This commit -
ment will involve both an increase in 
energy efficiency and a transition to 
renewable energy. It includes  
the following:
•  100% of factories enrolled in an 
energy efficiency programme by 
2025.
•  30% GHG reduction per product by 
2025 compared to 2017 baseline.
•  30% of factories will be enrolled in 
energy efficiency programme by the 
end of 2019. For 2018, the goal was 
to enroll 20% of factories in energy 
efficiency programme. If we calcu -
late our progress using the number 
of factories we had at the time of this 
goal-  setting, we reached this goal. 
However, because the number of 
factories has substantially increased 
since we set the goal, programme 
enrolment is currently at 18%.PROGRESS
• We are reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions at a factory level 
through supplier factories 
energy efficiency programmes 
in Bangladesh, China, India and 
Turkey. The energy savings from 
our 2018 efficiency improvement 
programs in Europe, China, Indo -
nesia, Vietnam and Pakistan are 
633,587,214 kWh, which equals 
a reduction of 183,296 tonnes of 
GHG emissions.
• We have created a new engage -
ment strategy to achieve our goal 
for energy efficiency and GHG 
reduction in the supply chain. This 
strategy allows us to work with 
our remaining suppliers who are 
diverse in size, energy profile and 
maturity of energy management. 
Having conducted a supplier cat -
egorisation exercise, we created 
targeted strategies and actions 
that directly address each group’s 
unique level of maturity, capacity 
and resulting needs.2016 2015 2014 2017 2018325kt 328kt374kt414kt587ktH&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201857 OF 109

100% renewable energy  
We are committed to maximising the use 
of renewable energy in our value chain. 
We know that by using more renewable 
energy and helping our suppliers and 
customers do the same, we are supporting 
the transition to fossil-free energy use.
OUR OPERATIONS
We want to source 100% renewable 
energy in our own operations. This 
year, 96% of the electricity purchased 
was renewable. We understand that 
adding new renewable energy (RE) gen -
eration capacity is needed to contrib -
ute to the necessary decarbonisation 
of energy systems, and we see that it 
makes good business sense too. As a 
result, our RE purchasing strategy will 
evolve from today’s focus on Environ -
mental Attribute Certificates (EACs) to 
a balanced portfolio of Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs) supporting large-
scale renewables projects, rooftop solar 
PV and EACs. We are also members of 
RE100, a group of businesses commit -
ted to using renewable electricity.
PROGRESS
• 96% of the electricity purchased  
was renewable.
• Solar panels covering 800 m² were 
installed at our Head Office in Stock -
holm. A production of 105 000 kWh 
clean energy is expected annually.
• This year we have concluded our 
five-year initiative ‘Double Sales – Half 
Impact’ for our IT operations to break 
the link between business growth and environmental impact. Despite a 75% 
increase in the number of H&M group 
stores, we reduced our IT operations’ 
energy consumption by 48%. This is 
thanks mostly to new capacity from 
solar panels and heat recovery from 
data centres. The initiative was lim -
ited to in-store IT systems, office IT 
systems, servers and data centres. In 
total, we saved over 27 million kWh, 
the equivalent of 10.9 million kilograms 
of carbon dioxide and electricity cost 
savings of EUR 4 million.*Due to inaccuracy in calculation, the 2017 share has 
been corrected from 96% to 95%.

To guide our work in terms of 
reducing CO 2 emissions from 
transportation we have put 
together a Renewable fuel 
strategy. The key compo -
nents are to support the use 
of electrical vehicles and 
second generation bio-fuels.
In recent years, we have 
actively supported the shift 
to more last-mile deliveries 
by electric vehicles. So far, 
we use electric trucks in 
Cyprus, France, China, Italy 
and Finland. Although this 
represents a small share 
globally, in certain markets 
a significant percentage of 
deliveries are performed by 
electric trucks. For example, 
in China, 50% of last-mile 
deliveries for store distri -
bution were made using electric trucks in late 2018. 
In Italy, we are working 
with a pioneering trans -
port service provider that 
is advocating the usage of 
electric vehicles in the Ital -
ian market. This makes up 
19% share of total transport 
in Italy, and 79% of the total 
transport in the major cities 
of Milan, Brescia, Florence, 
Turin and Rome. All deliver -
ies for & Other Stories and 
COS in Italy are served by 
electric vehicles. 
We are working to overcome 
several obstacles that are 
currently slowing the intro -
duction of more electrical 
vehicles. This includes a 
changing policy and taxation 
landscape, which makes 
long-term investments risk -ier for our transport service 
providers. The widespread 
lack of infrastructure for 
electric vehicle charging is 
also a challenge, as is the 
relatively short lifecycle 
for batteries, and the fact 
that electric vehicles can 
spend less time on the road 
because they need longer  
to charge.
In addition to electrical 
trucks and renewable fuel, 
we are striving to reduce 
the carbon impact of our 
operations through other 
measures, including opti -
mising transport routes 
and number of deliveries 
per trip, filling grade, and 
training drivers to reduce 
fuel consumption through 
efficient driving techniques.Going electric in transport operations

several rooftop solar projects and 
demonstrated the business case 
using results of feasibility studies 
conducted last year.
• We have initiated several projects with 
our suppliers in China and India for the 
installation of rooftop solar panels.We are engaging our suppliers to 
accelerate the adoption of renewa -

panels on factory rooftops is one of 
today’s most feasible clean energy 
solutions. In China, we have been 
working with stakeholders to educate 
suppliers and support feasibility 
studies, as well as project design and 
implementation.Like other suppliers, Wuxi Shilead Dyeing 
Co., Ltd was convinced by the feasibility 
studies to embrace rooftop solar. Once 
live, the 1,98MWp rooftop solar project 
will generate significant positive eco -
nomic and environmental impacts, such as 
annual 1,883-ton reduction in greenhouse 
gas emissions, along with the reduction 
of other air pollutants. On average, the 
22,000  m² rooftop solar system can gen -erate 2,133,200 kWh electricity every year; 
>90% of this will be used on-site. The pro -
ject should make a return-on-investment in 
less than six years and have GHG reduction 
of 1,755 tonnes.
This is just one of the rooftop solar 
projects commissioned by our suppliers 
in 2018, as a result of our low carbon 
roadmap. Accelerating solar energy in our supply chainOUR SUPPLIERS
To reach our climate positive goals, 
we want to help all our suppliers use 
renewable energy. However, although 
some partners already source clean 
energy, many have limited access to 
viable renewable energy, particularly 
in new markets. We are working 
closely with stakeholders, including 
government bodies, to change this.
Solar energy is one of the most 
feasible clean energy solutions.

Climate resilience & carbon sinks
Our commitment to the elimination of greenhouse 
gas emissions from our own operations remains as 
strong as ever. However, we know there will still be 
unavoidable emissions in our value chain, whatever 
action we take. We are therefore engaging in activ -
ities to absorb carbon (both within and beyond our 
direct control) to become truly climate positive.
These activities include supporting mechanisms 
that reduce existing emissions while strengthening 
climate resilience. We need to further develop this 
approach and collaborate with experts to move 
solutions forward, and are currently exploring 
opportunities in three areas: 
1. Natural carbon sinks – these are nature’s exist -
ing mechanisms for absorbing greenhouse gases. 
Potential strategies include protecting valuable 
biomass (such as rainforests) and investing in more 
sustainable agriculture.
2. Technological carbon sinks – these are tech -
nological innovations that absorb existing green -
house gases and turn them into new products  
and materials. 
3. Reductions outside our value chain – these activi -
ties reduce greenhouse gases coming from sources 
unrelated to our value chain. We urge innovators 
and experts to collaborate with us and like-minded 
partners to develop these opportunities.PROGRESS

100% Fair & Equal100% FAIR & EQUALOur 100% Fair & Equal ambition has  
two focus areas:
1. Providing fair jobs for all 
• within H&M group  
• within our supply chain
2. Inclusion and diversity
A fair job is defined as one with fair  
compensation, a safe and healthy work -
place, an environment free from discrim -
ination and one in which every employee  
is heard . At H&M group, we believe that a 
fair job should make every individual feel 
valued, respected and engaged within 
their workplace. Fair jobs enable people 
to enjoy life and provide for themselves 
and their families.

H&M group directly contributes to 
1.6  million jobs*, and the textile industry 
has helped many people and countries 
out of poverty. H&M group has been 
working for many years to ensure that 
all jobs within our supply chain are 
fair jobs. Back in 1998, we started an 
assessment programme to help moni -
tor working conditions in supply chain 
factories, which has led to improvements 
ever since. However, certain issues are 
complex and require collaboration and 
systemic industry-level action to ensure 
lasting change.  
In 2013, in close dialogue with a variety 
of external experts, unions and inter -
national organisations, we updated our 
social sustainability strategy. It now 
takes a more holistic approach with an 
increased focus on capacity building, collaboration and structural change at 
factory, industry and country level.  
Our assessment programme contin -
ues to provide a solid foundation for 
our work and is an integral part of our 
company risk and human rights due 
diligence framework (read more on 
page 92). The programme ensures our 
requirements are met, drives contin -
uous improvement and informs our 
core social sustainability strategy. Our 
strategy covers salient global and local 
human rights issues, with a focus on the 
rights we believe will help us meet our 
ambition to ensure fair jobs for all.Fair jobs for all: within our supply chain (production)
We are working with our suppliers to achieve our ambition that 
everyone in our supply chain has access to a fair job. Although 
the concept of a fair job sounds simple, many of the production 
markets in which we operate are developing countries and they 
either lack or face challenges in implementing the legislation  
that would make fair jobs available to all. This creates an 
industry-wide challenge.

• build industry collaborations 
• engage with local governments 
MAKING SURE WORKERS ARE HEARD

team in almost every country in which 
our products are made. Each PO team is 
responsible for working with our vari -

facilitate stronger relationships between Enabling well-functioning industrial relations
local factory employees and factory man -

our workplace dialogue programmes 
with workers and management to raise 
awareness of rights and obligations, 
including the importance of freedom of

teams can also provide worker and man -
agement training around the democratic 
election of workers’ representatives in 
the factories. 
Worker representatives, trade unions 
and workers’ committees are impor -
tant components for making sure 
workers are heard. These can address 
issues such as working hours, health 
and safety, grievances, etc. Unions are 
particularly well suited to negotiate 
wages in good faith with employers, 
while worker representatives can use 
the trust from their peers and respect We believe well-functioning industrial relations are crucial to the 
creation of fair jobs. We have seen how good working conditions 
and better wages are more likely to come from good relationships 
between workers, their representatives and management, and 
effective interactions and negotiations between social partners at 
a factory, industry and country level. Good labour relations also

Role Machine operatorMeeting an elected worker-representative
Why did you want to be 
re-elected as Vice Chair?
I find my daily communication  
and dialogue with workers and  
managers in my factory inspiring, 
so I decided to stand for re-elec -
tion in 2017. I am very happy  Our supplier, Newage Apparels LTD, elected their first 
worker participation committee in June 2014. Here,  
we meet Ms. Shahida Khanom, who joined the factory 
in 2010 and works as a machine operator. She was 
elected as Vice Chair of the nine-person committee in 
2014 and re-elected to the position in September 2017.
The Executive Director at 
Newage Apparels LTD during 
info session with trainees.BUILDING INDUSTRY COLLABORATIONS 
We believe that industry-wide collaboration is 
essential to establish the agreements and strate -
gies needed to further improve industrial rela -
tions. One of the key relationships we have built is 
with the trade unions, IndustriALL and IF Metall. 
We have a Global Framework Agreement (GFA) in 
place to improve industrial relations in our supply 
chain. The GFA focuses on the right of freedom of 
association and collective bargaining. 
We have set up National Monitoring Committees 
(NMC) as a collaborative mechanism under the 
Global Framework Agreement (GFA) in Bangla -
desh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Turkey. 
NMCs are composed of local IndustriALL- 
affiliated trade union representatives and local 
H&M group production office representatives. 
NMCs work with partners to co-develop action 
plans, establish long and short-term goals for the 
implementation of the GFA and deliver agreed 
action points, most of which concern the facilita -
tion of conflict resolution for both employers  
and  employees.
The role of an NMC is:
 • To create, monitor and evaluate national strate -
gies to implement the GFA.
• To create collaboration between trade unions, 
workers’ representatives and H&M group suppliers 
to support well-functioning industrial relations, 
with a focus on dispute prevention and resolution.
H&M group is also a founding member of Action 
Collaboration Transformation (ACT), a partner -
ship between international brands, retailers and 
trade unions that exists to address the issue of 
a living wage through industry-wide collective 
bargaining. Read more about our work with ACT 
on page 75 .I was re-elected because I really 
enjoy contributing to a better 
dialogue between management 
and workers.  
What do you think is important 
in your role?
My role is to gain trust from the 
workers by always listening  
carefully to what they have to say 
so I can deliver their messages 
to the managers. I always try to 
explain the overall picture of a 
challenge in the factory so that 
workers are not disappointed if 
they don�t see quick fixes.
What are the best things about 
being a Vice Chair?
It has been great professional  
and personal development for 
me. I have improved my communi -
cation skills and strengthened  
my dialogue with both workers  
and managers. I am more  
confident overall. It is also a great 
feeling to know I am contributing 
to improving the workplace  
dialogue in this factory.“ Efficient workplace  
dialogue is the key to 
become one force, together 
we can build a better 
future!  ”

factories in 2018 (2017: 458, 2016: 290, 
2015: 132). Our 2018 programmes included 
factories in China, Bangladesh, Cambodia, 
India, Indonesia, Turkey, Ethiopia, Myanmar, 
Pakistan and Vietnam. In total, we reached 
840,000 workers.
• Factories producing 73% of our product

global meeting for National Monitoring Com -
mittees (NMCs) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 
Each NMC reported on its progress during 
for 2018 and shared experiences from 
the past year. The meeting was attended 
by experts from both the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) and the International Labour Organ -
isation (ILO), who hosted workshops on due 
diligence in supply chains, procedures for 
dispute resolution, and the definition of Inter -
national Labour Standards.• We have been working with Ethical Trading 
Initiative (ETI) to raise our concerns about 
Cambodia’s change in trade union law.
• Our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
with the Swedish development agency Sida 
shares the common goals of supporting 
ILO’s Decent Work Agenda and developing 
opportunities that contribute to sustainable 
development in our supply chain.LEARNING
• Our Global Framework Agreement (GFA) 
with IndustriALL and IF Metall is an agree -
ment between the global union of textile 
workers and its affiliated unions to collabo -
rate for well-functioning industrial relations 
in our supply chain. The GFA is a framework 
that can create awareness and maturity 
between labour market parties to effec -
tively negotiate and engage in dialogue. 
It will take time to build up the necessary 
structures, and we are only at the beginning 
of this long journey.ENGAGING WITH GOVERNMENTS 
Enabling legal and institutional 
frameworks is crucial for well-func -
tioning industrial relations. We engage 
with governments and policy mak -
ers directly and indirectly, conduct 
advocacy work and have an agreement 
with ILO to cooperate and collaborate 
around the implementation of the 
Decent Work Agenda . Through our 
partnerships, we are in a good position 
to engage with governments and other 
national stakeholders.
As a partner of ILO, we promote ILO 
conventions and engage in the debate 
on important public policy issues that 
affect the well-being and rights of  
the workforce.

When we devised our Fair Living Wage Strategy, we set measurable goals, milestones 
and actions to be achieved between 2014 and 2018. As we started to accomplish these, 
we used what we’d learned to increase our ambitions, setting further goals, expanding 
our scope and improving our measurements. This process led to the development of 
five key goals for 2018:

Goal  Ensure that supplier 
factories producing 50% of 
H&M group’s product volume have

LIVING WAGE STRATEGY
Achieving our goals means that today, 
930,000 garment workers work in 
factories that are either implementing 
improved Wage Management Systems 
or have democratically elected worker 
representation – or, in most cases, 
both. This is an important achievement 
that lays the foundation for structural 
changes by making sure workers’ voices 
are heard in a better way. 
Over the last five years, we have ana -
lysed data from hundreds of factories 
in some of our most important sourcing 
markets to gain further understand -
ing of the impacts that have and can 
be created at a factory level. We have 
learned that our work can achieve great 
progress in individual factories, but it 
has limitations – we need broader per -
spectives, involvement at industry level 
and legislation.UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT 
COMPONENTS OF WAGES
Wages are a complex issue. In order to 
achieve fair living wages for all garment 
workers, it is important to understand 
the components of a textile worker’s 
monthly take-home wage and how they 
can be influenced. In general, there are 
two components:
The biggest component is minimum 
wages which are stipulated by govern -
ments and the lesser component is indi -
vidual wage setting and factory benefits. 
Combined, these components make up 
the take-home wage for garment workers. 
We believe that improved Wage Manage -
ment Systems will help factories become 
fairer and more transparent in the way 
they work with individual wage setting 
and bonuses. We have supported our 
suppliers in establishing transparent 
wage grids in their factories, which show 
Seamstress in one of our supplier factories.

how they can influence their wage by 
improving their skills and performance, 
etc. At the same time, the improved Wage 
Management Systems strengthen and 
mature Human Resources management 
systems, which should lead to increases 
in motivation, retention and productivity 
among the workforce.
When analysing the data from supplier 
factories in our key market suppliers, we 
can see that the factories which are imple -
menting improved Wage Management 
Systems pay higher take-home wages than those which don’t (see tables no. 5.1. and 
5.2.). In 2017, the difference ranged from 
8% higher take-home wages in Bangladesh 
to 29% in Indonesia. In 2018, the differ -
ence ranged from 2% in Turkey to 11% 
in Indonesia. In Myanmar first factories 
started implementing improved Wage 
Management Systems in late 2017 which 
is why first results show a positive devel -
opment since 2018. 
Besides higher take-home wages, the 
factories that are enrolled in our Wage 
Management System programme (but also 
all other factories) increasingly provide 
workers with non-monetary benefits, such 
as subsidised or free meals, housing subsi -dies, medical insurance, free child care or 
health services, and transport subsidies. 
This is not reflected in the take-home 
wage figures mentioned in graph 5.1., but 
it means workers spend less money or 
receive additional benefits.
By creating incentives and structures 
that reward workers’ skills, performance 
and loyalty, etc., we can make significant 
improvements to the situation of work -
ers and the operations of our supplier 
factories. However, there is a limit to both 
how much can be achieved at a factory 
level, and to how much above the indus -
try standard a factory can pay without 
losing their competitiveness. So, while it is important for factories to implement 
improved Wage Management Systems 
and similar measures, this is not the 
whole solution to a future of fair living 
wages for workers.
For this reason, our strategy has always 
looked beyond individual factories to 
find solutions that can increase mini -
mum wage in a sustainable and compe -
tition-neutral way. These solutions bring 
together all relevant actors, from govern -
ments, factory owners and other brands, 
to workers and trade unions. Learn more

ment Systems here .

by H&M group’s developers in the different production markets. The data is weighted by factory in flat averages. We are currently working to further improve our data method and instead report wage data as a weighted average per worker, since we see it as a better and 
more representative measure of salary in a country. We plan to report according to this new method with our 2019 report. The Conversion to USD is based on Swedish Central Bank average exchange rate for the period.2017 IN USD 2018 IN USD INCREASE

supplier factories, including those not 
enrolled in our Wage Management 
System programme and excluding any 
overtime compensation, we can see that 
H&M group supplier factories pay signif -
icantly higher wages than the relevant 
minimum wage. For 2018, this ranges 
from 24% more in Cambodia to 122% 
more in China (Guangdong).
Increases are in most markets often 
above inflation rates according to the 
IMF . However, even if the wage incre -
ments are higher than the inflation rate 
in a majority of the countries, workers are 
facing increments of housing rents, food 
prices, etc. which leads to no real wage 
increment for the workers in the end.
FROM MINIMUM WAGES TO INDUSTRY-  
WIDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
To achieve industry-wide living wages, 
minimum wages must increase. The 
minimum wage is the most important 
benchmark for wages in the industry 
and usually defines the biggest portion 
of a worker’s income. Today, it is usually 
defined by minimum wages, which are 
set by governments. 
Over the past five years, minimum wage 
levels have increased substantially in 
several countries – wages are up by 82% 
in Cambodia and 60% in Bangladesh. 
While this is a positive development, these 
increases are not enough. Too often, they 
simply reflect the poverty line in these 
countries and neither keep up with infla -
tion nor the growth in industry in these 
markets. As a result, the minimum wage 
in most markets is not a living wage.We share the view of the UN body ILO 
and many other experts, that the only 
lasting and viable way to achieve sub -
stantial and sufficient increases in the 
minimum wage for all workers is through 
fair negotiations between workers, trade 
unions and employers. This requires 
collective bargaining agreements that 
empower workers’ representatives to 
engage in fair negotiations. This approach 
replaces the idea that global brands 
should impose specific wage levels, a 
short-sighted tactic that undermines the 
role of workers, unions, employers’ organ -
isations and governments to effect lasting 
change. Wages are an industry-wide chal -
lenge, and therefore need to be solved at 
an industry level to stand the test of time. 
Instead of imposing specific wage levels, 
brands should ensure that our purchas -
ing practices facilitate the payment of a 
living wage and enable collective bargain -
ing. Brands also need to advocate govern -
ments because they can set the necessary 
legal framework, ensuring the right to 
freedom of association and enabling col -
lective bargaining.
This is not an easy thing to achieve, 
especially considering trade union 
representation is low in many sourcing 
markets and industrial relation sys -
tems are often immature or even legally 
restricted. However, we believe this is the 
only way that workers wages can increase 
in a sustainable way, with a level playing 
field. While it takes time to change com -
plex systems like this, we can see signif -
icant progress and a growing consensus 
between relevant stakeholder groups to 
collaboratively drive structural change at 
an industry and country level.

TRANSFORMATION
The formation of ACT represents a sig -
nificant milestone on the journey to fair 
wages. ACT is a ground-breaking coali -
tion of 22 global brands, including H&M 
group, and IndustriAll Global Union. The 
group’s mission is to transform the gar -
ment, textile and footwear industry and 
achieve living wages for workers through 
collective bargaining at industry level. 
One particularly game-changing com -
ponent in ACT’s approach is to include 
brands’ purchasing practices in the 
equation. While local employers and 
trade unions should negotiate wage levels 
and working conditions with each other, 
brands can contribute with a commit -
ment to responsible purchasing practices. 
For example, they can offer long-term 
commitments to source from suppliers 
and markets that are willing to enter such 
a collective bargaining agreement. To 
support this, all ACT brands have signed 
a Memorandum of Understanding with 
IndustriAll Global Union, which commits 
them – amongst other things – to ensure 
that their purchasing practices facilitate 
the payment of a living wage.
You can read more about ACT and  
the meaning of an industry-wide collec -
tive bargaining agreement here . “ By addressing the structural barriers to living 
wages, ACT has the best chance of increasing  
garment workers’ wages in a way that is scalable, 
sustainable and enforceable.” JENNY HOLDCROFT, ASSISTANT GENERAL SECRETARY, 
INDUSTRIALL GLOBAL UNION
PURCHASING PRACTICES
A brand’s purchasing practices are an 
important contributor to achieving fair 
living wages. We developed a purchas -
ing practice guide as part of our 2013 
roadmap. It helps ensure best possible 
capacity planning, timely payments and 
much more. Thanks to these measures, 
93% of our suppliers regard H&M group as 
a fair business partner.
We also developed a ‘scientific pricing 
method’. This involves suppliers sharing 
with us all the major cost components 
that contribute to a product’s price, 
including the labour cost component. 
This means merchandisers can and will 
negotiate the price of a garment with our 
suppliers around all component costs 
except one: labour. This takes garment 
workers’ wages out of the equation for 
price negotiations. If wages increase 
as a result of a collective bargaining 
agreement, our method ensures the 
money needed to pay for these wages is 
accounted for. Together with the other 
brands within ACT, we are committed 
to ensure that higher wages are covered 
by our purchasing price. We believe this 
systematic isolation of the labour cost is 
important as an enabler to an industry  -
wide collective bargaining agreement.H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201876 OF 109

“ Our purchasing practices should make it possible to fulfil  
our business idea and give long-term benefits to workers,  
sup pliers, customers and the environment.” DAVID SÄVMAN, HEAD OF PRODUCTION, 
H&M GROUPCreating win-win-win situations with 
good purchasing practices
DAVID SÄVMAN, HEAD OF PRODUCTION, H&M GROUP
What does the term  
purchasing practices  
mean to you?
It simply means doing good 
business! Our purchasing prac -
tices should make it possible 
to fulfil our business idea and 
give long-term benefits to 
workers, suppliers, customers 
and the environment. During 
2018 we focused on suppliers’ 
production plans, our execu -
tion and follow up of produc -
tion volumes, as well as how 
we can secure ring-fencing 
labour costs in price negoti -
ations. This means when we 
negotiate price with a supplier, 
the labour cost is taken out of 
the equation.
How do you isolate the  
labour cost?
We exclude the labour cost from 
our price negotiations with the 
supplier. When we negotiate 
the price, it can only affect the 
material and quality, for example, 
and not the workers’ wages. 
What does the isolation of  
the labour cost mean to  
workers, suppliers and our 
business?
By isolating the labour cost, we can be more concrete and 
credible towards both suppli -
ers and production countries, 
and show that we can and 
will stand by our purchasing 
practices. It also means that 
we can do better business 
and minimize challenges for 
workers to get better working 
conditions.
How does the scientific  
pricing method work?
We transparently look at all 
parts of producing a product 
and make sure we have the 
right cost that creates win-win-
win situations: for the workers, 
our business partners and for 
H&M group.
You developed an app based 
on this method that other  
companies can use to isolate 
labour costs in the same 
way?
Yes! The app is called SEA 
(SMV Estimation Application), 
and it’s basically old facts 
packaged into a modern and 
user-friendly way! We believe 
that the only way to create 
change in the industry is to get 
as many brands as possible to 
join us.H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201877 OF 109

BETTER PREPARED FOR COLLECTIVE  
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS
As part of our Fair Living Wage Strategy, we 
have placed a strong focus on establishing well-  
functioning dialogue and democratically elected 
worker representation in factories. We exceeded our 
2013 goal for 50% of our product volume to come 
from factories with democratically elected worker 
representation, reaching 73% by 2018. Democrati -
cally elected representation provides workers with 
better opportunities to make their voices heard and 
resolve any issues that arise. 
Democratically elected worker representation 
also helps prepare suppliers for an industry with 
maturing industrial relations. Many of our supplier 
factories undergo a mindset shift when they initiate 
this kind of change, in which they recognise the 
benefits of improved dialogue with their workers 
and worker representatives. In turn, this leads to an 
openness in addressing specific key issues such as 
worker well  -being, health and safety, or wages and 
compensation.
Alongside this mindset shift, we have also seen an 
increase in the number of supplier factories with 
one or more trade unions. While this is a positive 
development that we will continue to support, more 
needs to be done by all actors involved. You can find 
out more about our Industrial Relations strategy on 
page 66.PROGRESS 
• We reached and exceeded the Fair 
Living Wage Strategy goals we set 
in 2013. In five years, this work has 
reached 655 factories and more than 
930,000 garment workers in ten differ -
ent countries . Read more on page 79 .
• ACT has brought together 22 differ -
ent brands as well as trade unions to 
work together to achieve industry-wide 
collective bargaining agreements, 
supported by brands’ common com -
mitments on purchasing practices. As 
part of this, all signatory brands have 
signed Memorandums of Understand -
ing, which commit them, amongst 
other things, to ensure their purchasing 
practices facilitate the payment of a 
living wage.
• H&M group developed and imple -
mented a ‘scientific pricing method’, 
which systematically removes labour 
costs from price negotiations with sup -
pliers, therefore ensuring that labour 
costs are paid and accounted for with 
each product order.
• We asked the Ethical Trading Initiative 
(ETI) to review our Fair Living Wage 
Strategy and implementation, and to 
compile an independent evaluation 
report. We recognise and have already 
addressed several of the report’s 
findings, such as further developing 
our purchasing practices using the 
above-mentioned scientific pricing 
method. With help from other stake -
holders, we’ll continue to address 
issues as we develop our strategy. ETI’s 
report is publicly available here . • In December 2018, we shared the 
ETI’s feedback from 150 key stake -
holders at an event in Phnom Penh. 
Through this kind of openness, we can 
jointly advance best practices, learn 
from shared challenges, and set the 
framework for joint steps forward to 
ensure fair living wages for all garment 
workers.
• In Ethiopia, the Government has not 
ratified the ILO Minimum Wage and 
has not set a minimum legal wage for 
the private sector. In 2018, together 
with the ILO we have engaged with the 
Ethiopian Government to advocate for 
a minimum wage-setting mechanism 
for the textile industry. Although we 
believe this process might take a long 
time, we are fully committed to support 
the ILO driven agenda.LEARNINGS
• Together with trade unions and other 
experts, we have learned that the best 
way to achieve wage increases in a 
scalable, lasting and competition-neutral 
way is through industry-wide collective 
bargaining agreements.
• We recognise that we cannot achieve 
industry-wide living wages only through 
factory level interventions. To achieve 
sustainable increases, minimum wages 
have to increase. Although there have 
been significant increases in minimum 
wages in several markets, the change has 
been too small and too slow to achieve 
industry-wide living wages.

Transformation) is a group of 
22 brands and retailers that 
are working together with 
IndustriALL towards a future 
in which all textile workers 
earn a fair living wage.
What makes ACT different?
ACT is something that has 
never been tried before. It’s a 
joint initiative between major 
brands in the garment and 
textile industry, plus Indus -
triALL, which has a clear 
objective to work together 
to achieve living wages for workers in the garment and 
textile producing countries.
What role does H&M group 
play in ACT?
H&M group has been at the 
forefront of our discussions, 
particularly around finding 
practical solutions. For exam -
ple, it is important that the 
brands buying from textile 
suppliers make sure their 
respective purchasing prac -
tices support a living wage. 
One of the agreements H&M 
group helped with is that the 
wage cost on a product is not up for negotiation, which 
ensures that workers’ wages 
are not negatively affected.
Why does the industry need 
ACT?
We are trying to prove that 
worker representation can 
lead to positive change. Some 
of the countries we work 
with have experienced other 
forms of worker representa -
tion, including bargaining by 
riot. We show these countries 
a different way – that it is 
possible to build systems to 
create stable and predictable 
development.
What has ACT achieved so 
far?
Bringing all these stake -
holders together was our 
first achievement. Our 
second was to agree to use 
industry-wide collective 
bargaining to engage with 
national actors in countries 
like Cambodia, Myanmar, 
Turkey and Vietnam. Our 
third achievement was to 
present the shared message 
that international brands – 
like H&M group – will make a 
country a preferred country 
of sourcing if they share our 
vision of a living wage for 
textile workers. Interview with Frank Hoffer, Executive Director of ACT
Frank Hoffer.“ Progress against the H&M group’s 2018 
targets already points to the measurable 
contribution such strategies can make 
towards key Sustainable Devel  opment 
Goals. The company’s next targets must 
maintain and increase the pace of change. 
And even more companies within and 
beyond the apparel sector should feel  
challenged to follow suit.”
 CAROLINE REES, 
BUSINESS & HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERT, 
PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER OF SHIFT NEXT STEPS
We remain committed to our vision 
of achieving fair living wages for all 
textile workers. We will continue 
to work with our supplier factories 
to further build on the positive 
learnings and impacts from the 
implementation of improved Wage 
Management Systems, as well as the 
implementation of democratically 
elected worker representatives. 
Beyond this, we know we’ll con -
tinue to need strong collaboration with various actors. Therefore, 
we will further expand our work 
with key partners in the industry 
moving forward. This includes 
continuing to work with ACT and 
its ground-breaking approach to 
achieving fair living wages.
We will continue to take a leading

10 of our factories in a project to prevent 
child labour and protect young workers. 
The project aims to train factory manage -

on the prevention and remediation of child 
labour. We have now covered all our sup -
plier factories, in total 45 in Myanmar over 
the course of our work with CCR CSR .

We make it an absolute, minimum 
requirement for all factories producing

child labour taking place in an H&M 
group-supplying factory is very small. 
During 2018 we identified 1 case of an 
underage worker in a factory in China. 
The boy was 15 years and 10 months 
old (in China minimum working age is 
16 years). In dialogue with the boy and 
his family it was agreed, that he should 
attend a vocational training school until 
he reached legal working age. During 
this time, the factory compensated him 
in line with the legal minimum wage and Respecting human rights is a fundamental part of H&M group’s

Modern Slavery Statement, which is 
published each financial year alongside 
our annual sustainability report.ADDRESSING HEALTH & SAFETY
Our priority is to ensure that all 
workplaces in our business and supply 
chain are places that always prioritise 
health and safety for workers. Where 
hazards do occur, these workplaces 
must take preventative measures to 
safeguard and protect workers’ safety. 
One of these preventative measures is 
to involve workers in health and safety 
awareness-raising, and to secure griev -
ance channels that enable workers to 
raise safety concerns. This requires 
worker representation, dialogue with 
factory management about issues of 
concern, and worker involvement in 
decisions that affect workplace-related 
health and safety issues.
ADVANCING THE BANGLADESH 
ACCORD 
H&M group actively supports the 
Bangladesh Accord, which was set up 
in May 2013 to help improve fire and 
building safety in the textile industry 
in Bangladesh. We were one of the first 
companies to sign the Accord and have 
been on the steering committee since 
day one. The Bangladesh Accord is now 
monitoring over 1,600 factories. 
Initially, the Accord was meant to be 
transferred to a local national regula -
tory body by May 2018. However, this 
transfer process depended on the local 
body satisfactorily demonstrating its 
capacity to inspect factories, protect 
workers, provide transparency and 
offer confidential complaints mech -
anisms. A Transitional Accord was 
signed in 2017 and became effective in 
June 2018.PROGRESS
• The High Court of Bangladesh inter -
vention has changed the scenario and 
we keep monitoring the situation closely. 
H&M group has a close and constant 
dialogue with the Bangladesh authorities, 
BGMEA, ILO and other stakeholders. Our 
position is that the timeline must secure 
the possibility for a smooth and progres -
sive transition of the Accord to a national 
regulatory body. Our presence and 
commitment in our production markets is 
long-term. H&M group has been sourcing 
from Bangladesh over three decades and 
currently we source from around 250 pro -
duction units. For further reference, our 
supplier list has been public since 2013 at 
sustainability.hm.com .
• 98% of our suppliers have remediated 
issues as defined by the Bangladesh 
Accord. Effective January 2019 we only 
place orders with factories that 100% 
comply with the Accord requirements.

• In Cambodia, the legislation regarding 
Fixed Duration Contracts (FDCs) and 
Undetermined Duration Contracts (UDCs) 
was amended by the government during 
2018 to better facilitate the use of UDCs 
– which are typically more secure for 
workers. We have started to map the ratio 
of UDCs to FDCs in our supply chain, and 
in 2019 we will work with suppliers and 
workers to increase the transition from 
FDCs to UDCs. Although progress on this 
issue has taken longer than expected 
since we first identified the problem, 
we have recently started to see signs of 
positive change. 
• In Turkey, H&M group is building capacity 
and collaborating with various stakehold -
ers to enable the formal employment of 
Syrian refugees in our supplier factories 
in Turkey. As of 2018, more than 300 
Syrian refugees are employed in over 20 
approved units in Turkey, supported by the 
United Work programme. The ILO SCORE 
initiative invited factory units employing 
Syrian refugees to participate in a training 
programme. Four facilities have partici -
pated so far, and the programme focuses 
on functional workplace dialogue and 
health and safety committees.
• In Italy, we engaged in a working group 
to map resources amongst local trade 
unions and government programmes 
that ensure responsible conditions for 
migrant workers.  ADDRESSING SOCIAL SECURITY 
Social security is a human right, and 
includes benefits such as healthcare, 
sick pay, work-related injury coverage 
and maternity leave. Social security can 
be undermined by recruiting and hiring 
methods that exclude people from social 
security schemes. Modern slavery is the 
worst example of this. Permanent forms 
of employment usually entitle employees 
to social security benefits, but in many 
countries, employment schemes do not 
always entitle their workers to the same 
kind of protection. In fact, some schemes 
can limit a worker’s ability to exercise 
their rights.
At H&M group, we seek to minimise 
these limitations by working with sup -
pliers to improve the terms they offer 
their workers. This starts by ensuring 
suppliers and factory management are 
both aware of and meeting their obliga -
tions under labour and social security 
laws. We then look to identify instances 
in which social security obligations 
are being systematically avoided. For 
example, some suppliers avoid providing 
better employment schemes through 
the continued use of short-term con -
tracts rather than the offer of full-time 
employment.
We also ensure that especially vulnera -
ble groups such as refugees can access 
social security system through proper 
registration.

We believe each and every individual 
should be treated fairly and equally, and 
are therefore dedicated to advancing 
inclusion and promoting diversity. We 
aim to understand, reflect and advance 
the inclusion of every person we connect 
with – from suppliers to customers – in 
all the diverse markets in which we oper -
ate. We believe this is the foundation for 
great customer experience and key to our 
ongoing success.  
In 2018, we intensified our continuing 
work around inclusion and diversity. One 
of the reasons was the key learning from 
the children’s hoodie, which many per -
ceived as racist. This was unintentional 
and consequently had to be addressed 
comprehensively. As a result, we have 
increased our emphasis and attention to 
our inclusion and diversity work. Dur -
ing 2018 we updated our strategy on 
inclusion and diversity and broadened 
the scope of our ambitions. We use our 
size and scale to advance inclusion and 
diversity towards our customers and the 
communities around us. An important step in implementing our strategy was 
the roll out of a new training programme 
on inclusion, diversity and unconscious 
bias, which raises awareness and helps 
us shape our goals, as well as identify 
improvement areas. Several markets, 
including South Africa and USA, have 
teamed up with external partners to 
customise their own training on inclusion 
and diversity. 
Our ambition is to be inclusive and 
become more diverse at all levels of our 
company. This will optimise our deci -
sion-making and team performance, and 
ensure we reflect and respect the diversity 
around us. We want to be inclusive across 
our wide customer offering, continue to 
promote diversity through our marketing 
and campaigns, and contribute to posi -
tive social impact through inclusion and 
diversity initiatives where we are present.
Rooted in our values, and through our 
global reach, we also want to be advocates 
for everyone’s right to be included and 
accepted, and to express who they are.Inclusion & diversity
Through relationships with our employees, business partners and 
customers, and through our global presence, H&M group represents 
and connects with a huge number of people around the world. This 
presents us with a unique opportunity to drive inclusion and diversity. H&M colleagues

• According to our employee survey, 83% 
of H&M group employees agree with the 
statement ”I feel comfortable being myself 
at work”. 81% of H&M group employees 
agree with the statement “I am treated with

• In 2018, 74% of all H&M group employees 
were female and 72% of management posi -
tions were filled by female employees (2017: 
76%, 72%).
• Our Board of Directors was represented by 
a 60%:40% (female:male) gender split.
• Our Internship for Integration programme 
focuses on providing refugees in Germany, 
Sweden and Italy with work experience 
opportunities. In 2018, Spain launched a 
similar programme. The internship initiative has been around for three years and has had 
a positive impact for all participants. Going 
forward, we will work to strengthen our 
social impact measures as well as look into 
possibilities to scale up.  
• Our initiative to provide safe transport to 
and from work for our female H&M store 
employees in India continued. In addition, 
we are working with vocational schools, 
such as the World Class Skill Centre and 
Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services 
Skills Development Corporation Limited, and 
NGOs such as the Magic Bus and Oasis, to 
attract and recruit new colleagues from less 
advantaged socio-economic backgrounds. 
Approximately 5% of our employees have a 
chance to be hired through these partner -
ships. 
• All our head office functions, including the executive management team and the 
CEO, have completed our internal training 
programme for inclusion and diversity and 
unconscious bias, which covers aspects 
across our value chain. 
• In 2018, we initiated a further roll-out of 
trainings to reach most of our employees. 
The training programme aims to ensure 
more intentional goal-setting around inclu -
sion and diversity throughout the employ -
ment lifecycle, and to identify clear action 
points related to an inclusive customer 
offer, advancing inclusion and promoting 
diversity.
• We have worked with different focus mar -
kets throughout the year. For example, we 
partnered with the Institute for Justice and 
Reconciliation in South Africa to conduct 
internal training for the ZA organisation. We also participated in the Anti-Racism Network 
conference. In the USA, we partnered with 
Accenture to offer internal training, and put 
a Diversity Officer in place to drive our inclu -
sion and diversity strategy forward.
LEARNING – INTERNAL
• During the roll-out of internal training on 
inclusion, diversity and unconscious bias, 
we realized there are a lot of learnings for 
us as an organization. We are a global com -
pany but need to adapt to, and address, 
issues of local relevance. This is why we 
have started to review our policies and 
processes to further improve an inclusive 
approach and way of working. A key insight 
from the training on unconscious bias is 
that we constantly need to challenge our 
perspectives. In 2019, we will continue to 
look into how we can effectively measure 
inclusion and diversity.
“ We commend H&M group for its investment in a series 
of our interventions. The increasing complexity of the 
issues facing society often make people long for simple 
answers. However, for H&M group to provide an opportu -
nity for their staff to engage with the issues is a  proactive 
move to  contribute positively, not only to internal 
 company culture and values, but also to building a more 
cohesive and inclusive society. ”

Why is it important for you to 
work with gender equality? 
I have always cared about par -
ticipation in civil society activi -
ties, as well as business life. As a 
student and as an entrepreneur, 
I have experienced various 
difficulties and realized the 
sacrifices that women need to 
make in order to succeed in the 
business world. This should not 
be the case, women and men 
should have equal opportunities 
in all aspects of life, at home 
and at work.
What kind of role can your 
business play?
The business world has a great 
responsibility in this area in 
addition to government policy. 
Gender equality is at the very 
heart of human rights and a 
corner stone on which I founded 
my company. Suteks is based 
on gender equality which not 
only involves the opportunities that we offer to our female 
employees during pregnancy 
and the first period of mother -
hood, but also all employees 
taking advantage of the oppor -
tunities to keep a good work 
and family balance in life. Non- 
hierarchical management, as 
well as the profit share system 
are unique management tools.
How can we advance gender 
equality?
In my opinion, women’s access 
to education is one of the 
best ways to eliminate gen -
der inequality. As the level of 
education increases, so does 
women’s participation in the 
labour force. But gender equal -
ity isn’t possible without includ -
ing men. For many years now, 
women in this country have 
been alone in their struggle 
for women’s rights and social 
gender equality. That is why 
I founded Yanindayiz (Stand 
By You) together with 40 male 
members, all advocating for 
gender equality in Turkey. In 
order to get changes in the 
laws, institutions and social life, 
we aim for the better aware -
ness and active involvement of 
men in the struggles against all 
obstacles and prejudices that 
cause gender inequality and 
sexual discrimination.Advocating for gender equality in Turkey
Nur Ger.“ In a global society, there is still 
work to be done to achieve gender 
equality. It is an explicit priority 
for the world, through the sus -
tainable develop ment goals, and 
it is a priority for us. As a large 
company where the majority of 
people employed by us directly 
or indirectly are women, we need 
to ensure that we address both 
structural and unconscious ine -
qualities. We are sig  natories to 
the Women’s Empow  erment Prin -
ciples and use these principles to 
guide our strategy development, 
goals and actions.”

In June 2018, the Kakuma Refu -
gee Camp in the north of Kenya 
hosted the world’s first TEDx 
event in a refugee camp. The 
theme was “Thrive” and it focused 
on life as a refugee away from the 
image of suffering, and towards 
stories of resilience, contribution 
and creativity. The event was a 
powerful demonstration of how empowered refugees can shape a 
peaceful and tolerant future.
The TEDx was part of a 30 million 
SEK collaboration between UNHCR 
and H&M Foundation. The pro -
ject’s main focus is supporting 
half a million refugee children with 
the school supplies they need to 
attend school in Chad, Ethiopia, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Pakistan, 
Rwanda, Sudan, South Sudan, 
Syria, Uganda and Yemen.
“H&M Foundation wants to 
contribute to positive change

Our sustainability standards and policies *Our business is always changing, with 
new needs, risks and opportunities 
arising all the time. Sometimes this is a 
result of external factors, such as explor -
ing a new business model; sometimes it 
comes from within our business, such as 
setting a new sustainability goal. We are 
aware of changes and respond appropri -
ately. When we become aware of a new 
need, risk or opportunity, we address it 
through a range of different actions. One 
action is to create a new set of standards and policies, together with a strategy to 
implement and evaluate it. 
Our standards and policies are part of 
our change-making programme and 
are an essential component in turning 
our strategy into action and making our 
vision a reality. 
To ensure we work with the correct 
standard and policy for the given need, 
risk or opportunity we always apply the same steps: we identify, we address, we 
implement, evaluate and report.
1. WE IDENTIFY
We identify new risks and opportunities 
by looking at our key long-term sustain -
ability needs and conducting in-depth 
assessments of our own and our business 
partners’ operations. We use both inter -
nal and external assessment tools. Three 
focus areas require particular attention:
Human rights  To respect human rights 
throughout our value chain, we require 
ongoing due diligence processes. We con -
tinuously work to ensure human rights are 
an integral part of all relevant processes. 
Our processes help us identify risks and 
impacts, and address them effectively.
Environment We make sure to conduct 
daily assessments on water, chemicals, 
climate change, biodiversity and animal 
welfare as part of our basic risk manage -
ment operations. 
Corruption We assess levels of risk for 
corruption according to country, indus -
try and position/function. Once we know 
the level of risk, we set short and long-
terms goals for mitigation. Every year, we 
map our biggest corruption risks using a 
combination of our own assessments and 
experience, and external sources such 
as the Maplecroft Country Risk Tool and 
the Transparency International Percep -
tion Index. 
We use the results of this mapping to 
identify high-risk countries and to allocate 
our resources in the best way. We have a 
zero-tolerance policy for corruption. 
2. WE ADDRESS
Having identified a new need, risk or 
opportunity, we use a framework to 
address it in the best possible way. For 
risks, this means prevention, mitigation 
and remediation. The framework is either 
prescribed by an existing standard or pol -
icy, or is developed along with a new and 
more suitable standard or policy.
 
3. WE IMPLEMENT,  
EVALUATE & REPORT
We use a tailored strategy to implement 
the standard or policy that addresses 
the need, risk or opportunity we have 
identified. We track and evaluate this 
implementation to gain insight on how 
we can further strengthen and improve 
our programmes. We report our progress 
and findings to internal and external 
stakeholders through continuous dia -
logues, public communication channels 
and regular reports.H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201892 OF 109

ards to help prevent human rights 
impacts from occurring. Despite this, 
incidents may still arise that we need 
to address and resolve. If an incident 
should occur within the factory walls, 
our Sustainability Commitment and 
Minimum Requirements apply. This 
is handled in accordance with our 
set routines. However, when human 
rights violations occur in a country 
but not directly linked to textile 
industry, we as a company need to to take a stand. For example, in Myan -
mar, when the military-led operations 
in northern Rakhine intensified in 
2017, H&M group and other brands 
used their leverage to express con -
cerns to the government on a number 
of occasions, increasingly so after the 
UN Fact Finding Mission was released 
end of August 2018. EUCham Gar -
ment Advocacy Group was formed in 
March 2018, and met with ministries 
in September 2018 to discuss the 
Rakhine situation. Read more on our 
advocacy work here  and here .

HUMAN RIGHTS DUE DILIGENCE
Our human rights due diligence is an ongoing pro -
cess that monitors the practice of and respect for 
human rights throughout H&M group. We conduct 
this due diligence systematically during relevant 
assessment processes including, for example, risk 
management processes, business partner due dili -
gence, stakeholder engagement, grievance handling 
and all internal training. Each assessment process 
contains a clear component that enables us to iden -
tify, address and report on any risks or impacts that 
relate to human rights.
HUMAN RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
Our human rights due diligence serves as the basis 
for implementing our human rights management. 
The main processes and activities connected to our 
human rights management include:Respect for human rights is funda-
mental to any successful business.  
As our human rights policy states, we 
work to integrate this respect across  
all operations and relevant activities.  
To do this, we must both understand 
the risks and impacts on human rights 
in our value chain and seek ways to 
prevent, mitigate and remediate these 
risks and impacts.

We conducted a thorough process to iden -
tify our salient human rights issues in 
2015. Salient human rights issues are the 
human rights at risk of the most severe 
negative impact because of our operations 
and supply chain. This process supple -
ments our materiality analysis in the area 
of human rights, with an understanding 
of risk to people.
Besides guiding us on the human rights 
issues relevant to report according to the 
UNGP’s Reporting Framework, the process 
also informs our strategies and works to 
address these issues going forward. To 
ensure our list of salient human rights 
issues remains relevant, we will review 
these issues annually. The full process, 
including input from external stake -
holders, will be conducted approximately 
every three years, or more frequently if 
necessary. While we take steps to mitigate 
all risks, salience guides us in what to 
focus on within human rights and hence 
informs our strategies and work.
Consequently the most recent review  
took place in 2017, and resulted in slightly 
adjusted definitions on, for example Child 
Labour changed to Child Rights.
Here is the full list of our Salient Human  
Rights issues . PROGRESS
• Having increased our knowledge of 
the UN Guiding Principles and how 
to approach them, we will update our 
Human Rights Policy during 2019.
 
• We assessed human rights issues for 
all our production countries to inform 
our prioritisation going forward. Actions 
on identified issues can be found on 
page 80.
• We see a trend where the migrant work -
force is growing, contributing to a higher 
risk for forced labour in several areas of 
our value chain. Alongside our ongoing 
work with our manufacturing partners, 
we’ve initiated a review of how we work 
with human rights issues in our logistics 
operations, as well as construction and 
facility management services. This will 
ensure that we can better identify and 
address human rights risks related to, for 
example, forced labour.
• We fine-tuned the Human Rights due 
diligence processes for our main produc -
tion markets.
• We trained staff from the Legal depart -
ment, as well as Expansion functions, coun-
try managers and functions� sustain  ability 
managers on the risk assessment process. H&M.

(FOR H&M GROUP EMPLOYEES)
Working in an ethical manner is an 
important part of our business. H&M 
group conducts business based on the 
principles of honesty, integrity, transpar -
ency and fair play. We have developed a 
Code of Ethics to make sure our employ -
ees know and practice these values. This 
code has a zero tolerance for bribery and 
corruptive practices and can be read in 
full on  sustainability.hm.com .
The Code of Ethics is the same in all 
markets and we have translated it into 
all languages spoken at H&M group. All 
employees are required to sign the Code 
of Ethics and receive practical training 
on how to act, and how to talk about and 
report violations. They will also learn 
about our whistleblowing procedure, 
through which potential breaches can be 
reported confidentially without any risk 
of reprisal.
Our security, IT and expansion func -
tions, along with several others, conduct 
internal audits of their department’s 
routines and policies. These audits 
include an analysis of how the Code of 
Ethics is being implemented. We also 
conduct random assessments on specifi -
cally risky markets or positions.We follow up on all reported incidents 
or suspicions of violation. Our Security 
department conducts the investigations 
and consequences can vary from a warn -
ing to termination of employment.
Every six months, our Head of Security 
reports on the number of breaches and 
case progress to the Board. We analyse 
cases to help us further improve our  
risk mapping for the future. We report 
the number of cases in our Annual 
Report and our Sustainability Report.
GLOBAL SECURITY POLICY
It is our responsibility to make sure our 
customers and colleagues feel safe. We 
conduct an annual store audit con -
sisting of safety, loss prevention and 
information security. We have iden -
tified employee training, as the area 
with most opportunity to improve our 
compliance rates. Training our employ -
ees includes how to work safely, prevent 
loss and comply with local legal safety 
training demand. We are working with 
HR to increase the safety and security 
awareness amongst our people through 
trainings.
WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY
We have a whistleblowing procedure in 
place so that potential breaches can be reported by H&M group employees confi -
dentially without any risk of reprisal.
GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICIES
Our business is global and has a grow -
ing presence in many markets around 
the world. We are expanding rapidly, 
which means a lot of new recruits. We 
recognise that our success depends on 
our people, so we take care to implement 
and improve our social policies. These 
include our global policy on inclusion, 
diversity and equality, and our global 
non-discrimination harassment policy, 
labour relations policy and grievance 
policy, all of which are founded on our 
respect for human rights and on UN and 
ILO conventions, amongst others .
Our social policies set our minimum 
expectations and complement our 
company values. They contain clear 
directions that help managers and 
employees to meet daily business needs, 
understand how to work and act towards 
business partners, and create fair and 
equal working conditions in safe and 
healthy workplaces. Our social policies 
are global and set the minimum stand -
ard regardless of local legislation where 
we operate. Our guiding principle is to 
use whatever gives the greatest protec -
tion for all colleagues.TAX POLICY

PROGRESS
• In 2018 we rolled out a new Sustainable 
Workplace Standard (SWS), which states 
a minimum level of sustainability require -
ments ensuring colleagues are working in 
sustainably functioning workplaces. The 
SWS also describes an aspirational level 
of performance, designed to encourage 
colleagues to tailor further sustainable 
adaptations in their workplaces.
• In 2018, our goal for the global store 
audit was 90% compliance. We com -
pleted 9,715 store audits and achieved 
85% compliance, where the safety area 
result of the global store audit was 87% 
compliance across all stores and brands. 
In 2019 we’re aiming to be 90% with the

partner, all new (and existing) business 
partners must sign and comply with our 
policies. Two of our most crucial policies 
are our Code of Ethics and our Sustaina -
bility Commitment.
CODE OF ETHICS 
(FOR OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS) 
We set an expectation of mutual trust 
and transparency in all our business 
partner relationships. We underpin this 
expectation with our Code of Ethics 
(CoE) and by building awareness, provid -
ing education and maintaining a strict 
no-gift policy.
We define business partners as any 
business that supplies us with goods and/
or services, acts on behalf of our busi -
ness or collaborates with us. That means 
business partners include suppliers (com -
mercial and non-commercial), vendors, 
consultants, landlords, agents, service 
providers, and organisations. Our biggest 
group of business partners is our com -
mercial goods suppliers; 100% of them 
have signed our CoE.
We will always address any kind of brib -
ery (including facilitation payments), and 
this may result in terminating a business 
relationship. We believe that taking such a firm line on bribery will encourage 
 others in our markets to share our values. 
We focus our efforts on high-risk coun -
tries, such as Cambodia, Bangladesh, 
India, and Russia, by providing training 
and awareness-building activities to both 
employees and business partners.
We provide all our new commercial  
suppliers with face-to-face training  
on our CoE. This training is focused on  
our zero tolerance of bribery and cor -
ruption, gifts and hospitality, and on our 
position on confidential information and 
 compliance.
SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT
We launched our Sustainability 
 Commitment in 2016; it replaced our Code 
of Conduct, which had been in place since 
1997. It outlines our basic requirements 
for all H&M group’s suppliers for commer -
cial goods and frames a long-term aspi -
rational level of performance we expect 
them to aim for. We want our suppliers to 
take this ownership of their sustainabil -
ity performance because we believe it is 
the best way to achieve long-lasting and 
sustainable change. 
Any suppliers that want to start or 
continue working with any H&M group 
brand must sign the Sustainability Commitment. The Sustainability Com -
mitment summarises the areas we are 
working on to make our supply chain 
more sustainable. The three major focus 
areas are healthy workplaces, healthy 
ecosystems and animal welfare. The Sus -
tainability Commitment also describes 
how we work with our suppliers to create 
progress in these areas.
We use a performance evaluation (see 
“How we assess our suppliers’ perfor -
mance beyond compliance”) to identify 
and reward those partners that commit 
to and meet the aspirations.
ASSESSING OUR SUPPLIERS  
COMPLIANCE AND PERFORMANCE
SIPP is our Sustainable Impact Partner -
ship Programme, and it applies to our 
suppliers. We use SIPP to assess levels 
of compliance with the Sustainability 
Commitment and to further measure our 
suppliers’ performance over time and 
drive constant improvements beyond 
compliance. SIPP consists of five major 
components: minimum requirements 
verification, self-assessment, validation, 
capacity building and case handling.Policies for our business partners

preliminary, pending SAC correction of a limited but known 
score calculation malfunction. Data is self reported and 
covers tier 1 and tier 2 factories in the apparel and footwear 
supply chain with more than 25 employees.
SELF-ASSESSMENT 
We empower our suppliers to use their 
initiative to further their  sustainabil  ity 
credentials. Once our suppliers have 
passed our initial minimum require  ment 
verification, we provide them with the 
training and tools to self-report their sus -
tainability credentials and performance 
on an ongoing basis.
We assess our partners’ capacity to man -
age their sustainability issues and track 
their performance. This component of 
SIPP is closely linked to the evaluation 
methodology of the Sustainable Apparel 
Coalition’s (SAC) Higg Facility Modules, 
part of the Higg Index suite of tools. 
The results of this SIPP assessment are 
captured in our Sustainability Index 
(SI). This index has a score of between zero and 100, which we assign based on 
the Higg Facility Modules and our own 
criteria.
We were one of the first brands to incor -
porate the Higg Facility Modules (both 
environmental and social) into our supply 
chain sustainability programme. The 
main advantage of the Higg facility scores 
is that all brands can use them, so suppli -
ers only need to complete one assessment 
rather than several brand-specific ones. As 
a result, factory assessments are fairer and 
more comparable, regardless of the brand.
Manufacturers use the Higg Facility 
Environmental Module (Higg FEM) to 
measure the environmental performance 
of their facilities. Higg FEM began being 
used by all our tier 1 apparel suppliers in 2015 (who base their self-assessment on 
the previous year’s data) and by 2018 it 
was rolled out to 100% of tier 1* and tier 2 
factories representing 65% of our products 
in 2018. The SAC which owns the tool has 
developed the content over the years, so 
the comparability over time is not perfect. 
However, we still want to share the jour -
ney of the supplier factories using the Higg 
FEM (see graph 6.1.). The Facility Social 
and Labor Module has been under devel -
opment for years and will be launched by 
SAC for the 2019 reporting cycle. 
So far we are the only brand disclosing our 
results, but we hope our industry peers 
will follow. To learn more about the Higg 
facility modules, visit SAC’s webpa ge.   Full-day sustainability

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
Before starting any working relation -
ship with a supplier, we conduct an 
“entry level minimum requirement ver -
ification”. All suppliers must pass the 
verification to begin working with us. 
(See Becoming an H&M group business 
partner for commercial goods illustra -
tion). Within the apparel and footwear 
supply chain an additional, “basic 
level” is required in order to begin 
working together. Other supply chains 
are permitted an agreed timeline (max -
imum 18 months) in order to fulfill 
the basic level. We also have ongoing 
minimum requirement checks and in 
2018 performed 2,223 across our tier 1 
and among our tier 2 suppliers. Please 
see more on minimum requirements 
verification findings on page 97.*Factories in the apparel and footwear supply chain,

Our suppliers self-report through SIPP 
and we validate the results. We deter -
mine what level of validation is appro -
priate for each factory based on their 
history, overall performance and risk 
assessments, among other indicators. We 
perform an onsite check at least once a 
year for all new and high risk suppliers. 
We may use desktop validation (checking 
data and paperwork for anomalies and 
inconsistencies) if the supplier is low risk.
We encourage our suppliers to set their 
own goals, priorities and focus areas. We 
reward those who set ambitious goals 
and maintain good performance, which 
incentivises our suppliers to improve 
their sustainability performance. These 
rewards include long-term business com -
mitments and growth opportunities.CAPACITY BUILDING
We use the validated assessments of our 
suppliers’ sustainability performance 
to identify their strengths and weak -
nesses. We use this information to ask 
our suppliers to set their goals and act 
to strengthen their capacity to better 
manage their sustainability performance. 
We work with our partners to identify 
areas where H&M group can best provide 
support through capacity-  building work -
shops, training and management systems 
analysis. We also build connections 
between our suppliers and other func -
tions at our production offices, such as 
our merchandising and quality depart -
ments. We use these connections to 
encourage our suppliers to develop their 
own strategies and solutions to chal -
lenges, as well as providing incentives to 
shift impacts from negative to positive PROGRESS
• 100% of our suppliers have signed 
our Code of Ethics and Sustainability 
 Commitment.
• We performed 2,223 minimum require -
ments verifications across tier 1 and tier 2 
suppliers.
• The self-assessment component of SIPP 
has been improved with the new 3.0 ver -
sion of SAC’s Facility Environment Module 
Higg FEM. With contributions from H&M 
group, the methodology has upgraded 
content and a more customized question-
naire leading to fairer scoring. This year we 
released the first Supplier Environmental 
Performance Score and for 2017 our score 
is 40 (2016: 37). See graph 6.1. on page 96  
for historic data and reporting boundaries.
• We continued to align SIPP and indus -
try standards and tools by piloting the 
assessment framework of the Social 
Labour Convergence Project.
 • We investigated and closed 47 inci -
dents* of potential non-compliance with 
the Code of Ethics (2017: 41, 2016: 39). 
These investigations led to terminations 
or written warnings to employees or busi -
ness partners in 12 cases.
*Please find an independent assurance statement related to 
GRI standard disclosure 205-3 on page 106 .H&M Home.ones. This consistent presence helps us 
build long-term and mutually rewarding 
partnerships.
Our capacity-building programme is a tool 
to support our suppliers in different focus 
areas, such as industrial relations, clean 
water, climate neutral supply chain, etc. 
Read more about our capacity-building 
programmes on pages 46 , 58 and 68 .
CASE HANDLING
If we learn about a problem or incident 
linked to a supplier, our sustainability 
team will log the case and investigate. 
Cases cover a broad range of issues and 
can concern anything from a specific 
facility to a regional natural disaster. If we 
have a confirmed case of non-compliance 
towards our minimum requirements by a 
supplier, we send a Letter of Concern, and 
further action depends on the number and 
kind of violation. We require a corrective 
action plan to be submitted by the relevant 
supplier, which we must approve before 
any further business is conducted. At this 
stage, we evaluate if the supplier involved 
is the right type of partner for H&M group. 
If we decide it is not, we phase them out 
and cease conducting business with them.
During previous years, we have seen the 
year-on-year decline continuing in what 
we call “business practice” violations, such 
as use of child labour (read more on page 
80 on one remediated case for 2018) or any 
lack of transparency on the part of a sup -
plier. Among our tier 1 suppliers non-com -
pliance against our social and environmen -
tal minimum requirements has remained 
at a consistent level, despite expanding and 
strengthening these requirements over recent years. As a result of expanding our 
scope, we have seen an increase in the 
number of violations. All these cases have 
been resolved according to our standards 
and policies, with a total of 108 Letters of 
Concern sent. We had 0 terminations of 
business relations with our factories.H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201898 OF 109

minimum, our chemical restrictions 
are based on laws and regulations in

apply the precautionary principle, 
which means we preventively restrict 
chemicals even where there is sci -

ANIMAL WELFARE AND  
MATERIAL ETHICS POLICY
Securing our supply of raw materials 
ethically is very important and we are 
committed to ensuring that the natural 
raw materials used in our products are 
produced in a way that respects human 
rights and animal welfare, preserves 
natural resources and helps maintain 
biodiversity.
We define our standards on responsible 
sourcing in our Animal Welfare and 
Material Ethics Policy, as well as setting 
our long-term direction in line with our 
goal for 100% recycled or other sustaina -
bly sourced materials by 2030.
We aim to have all our virgin animal- 
derived materials coming from farms 
that are certified to a credible  
animal welfare standard and are  
fully traceable.We also support the use of recycled  
animal fibres, as well as innovative and 
more sustainable materials that offer 
the same qualities but are from non  -

PROGRESS 
• We launched a new updated version 
of the Animal Welfare and Material 
Ethics policy at end of 2018.
PROGRESS
• Together with our suppliers, we have 
conducted 48,700 chemical tests to 
ensure compliance with our Restricted 
Substances List.
• We have invested in the train-the-
trainer programme based on Best 
Chemical Management Practice 
(BCMP) to implement cleaner pro -
duction. Our BCMP guidelines help 
our suppliers to minimise the use of 
hazardous chemicals by developing a 
strong chemical management system. 
BCMP is also closely linked to the new 
Higg FEM 3.0, ensuring that chemical 
performance is captured in suppliers’ 
overall evaluation.
CHEMICAL RESTRICTIONS
To ensure the ongoing safety of our 
products and to limit negative impacts 
on the environment and surrounding 
communities, we implement a strict 
global chemical management pro -
gramme and work towards alignment 
across our industry. Our vision is to 
lead the change towards safe products 
and a toxic-free fashion future. Our 
key goal is to achieve zero discharge of 
hazardous chemicals throughout our

from the relevant functions within H&M 
group and from external parties such as 
suppliers or implementation partners. 
This data is always reviewed by our inter -
nal controlling team, relevant experts in 
our sustainability team and expert func -
tions following a two-tier quality control 
principle. We clearly indicate any extrap -
olations or estimations. The same rule 
applies for any changes in data method -
ologies or scopes that may influence data 
comparability. We always base our data 
on the best possible systems that are cur -
rently available to us and, where applica -
ble, align it with recognised standards. 
However, it is important to understand 
that there are continued improvements 
in data systems, methodologies and 
scientific uncertainties. For example, 
while our GHG emissions accounting and 
reporting is aligned with the GHG Proto -col, the emission factors we use are from 
publicly-available sources such as the 
International Energy Agency (IEA 2017), 
the Network for Transport Measures 
(NTM), Reliable Disclosure System for 
Europe (RE-DISS) and supplier-specified 
emission factors. The global warming 
potential (GWP) factors used in the cal -
culation of CO₂e are based on the IPCCs 
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) over a 
100-year period.
The scientific knowledge used to deter -
mine emission factors is incomplete. This 
means GHG emission data, as with other 
data, is subject to inherent uncertainties 
that ultimately affect all measurements 
and estimations. Our reported energy 
usage is based on invoiced data, data 
from real-time electricity meters and data 
as reported by transport providers. We 
convert between fuel usage and energy 
content using energy values specified by 
the supplier or by using tabled values 
provided by national bodies.
We are required to make certain assump -
tions about waste factors, weight per 
sizes, etc. for our material reporting. We 
are continuously working to improve 
those aspects of reporting that may lead 
to minor updates in our yearly material 
consumption reporting, as well as our data systems and accuracy to report on 
material consumption.
Unless otherwise specified, all data con -
cerning business partners and supplier 
factories includes all suppliers and fac -
tories that were active and approved for 
production during the reporting period. 
We include the following factories in our 
scope: tier 1 manufacturing or processing 
(i.e. washing or dyeing), factories that are 
owned or subcontracted by our suppliers 
and, where stated, selected tier 2 sup -
pliers and suppliers for non  - commercial We are committed to transparent 
reporting on the progress we 
make towards achieving our 
sustainability strategy.

GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI) 
We have prepared this report in accord -
ance with the GRI Standards: Core 
Option. We have also included material 
indicators from the pilot of the Apparel 
and Footwear Sector Supplement. You

UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES  
REPORTING FRAMEWORK 
We were one of the first companies in the 
world to report on human rights in line 
with the UN Guiding Principles Report -
ing Framework. This framework is the 
first comprehensive guidance for compa -
nies to report on human rights issues in 
line with their responsibility to respect 
human rights set out in the UN Guid -
ing Principles on Business and Human 
Rights. Detailed references to the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework 
can be found at sustainability.hm.com .
We identified our salient human rights 
(page 93 ) in 2015, following a compre -
hensive process that involved a variety 
of internal and external stakeholders. 
We plan to conduct this process every 
third year, or as deemed necessary. On 
an annual basis, we will review the 
relevance and definitions of the issues 
identified and discuss emerging issues. 
This complements our materiality assess -
ment (described below), which identifies 
human rights as a highly material topic.
PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING  
THE MOST MATERIAL TOPICS  
AND THEIR BOUNDARIES*
1. Identification: Mapping aspects  
and creating a gross list 
We conduct an annual review of our gross 
list of aspects. This is based on an analy -
sis of external standards, such as the GRI 
Standard topic list, legislation, investor 
and NGO questionnaires, peer reviews, 
business intelligence, lifecycle assess -
ment results, stakeholder dialogues and 
stakeholder reports, and media coverage. 
The gross list has been checked against 
GRI’s Sustainability Context and Stake -
holder Inclusiveness tests most recently 
in 2016.
2. Prioritisation: Scoring  
and prioritising topics** 
We prioritise the most material topics 
from this gross list by scoring different 
aspects on their frequency (how often 
they are raised by stakeholders) and their 
significance for economic, environmental 
and social impacts. We then break these 
categories down further. For frequency, we look at frequency raised by key 
defined sustainability stakeholders and 
experts (weighted x3), frequency featured 
in media (weighted x1) and frequency 
raised in key sustainability benchmarks, 
rankings and indices (weighted x1). For 
impact, we look at social and environ -
mental impacts (weighted x1) and impor -
tance to business strategy (weighted x2). 
At least two internal experts per category 
gave scores, which were based on lifecy -
cle assessment (LCA) data and existing 
strategy documents.
We also chose at least one representative 
from each of our key stakeholder groups 
(which includes customers, colleagues, 
communities, suppliers and their employ -ees, industry peers, NGOs, IGOs, policy -
makers and investors). We asked eleven 
stakeholder representatives to feedback 
on our materiality matrix.
3. Regular review of our materiality 
matrix with key stakeholders*** 
We review our materiality matrix on an 
annual basis. This can mean conducting 
a full materiality analysis (as conducted 
in 2013 and 2016) as described in points 
1 and 2 or a review of previous year’s 
matrix considering feedback received. HOW WE REPORT  / MATERIALITY MATRIX / UN ’S SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS / KEY COLLABORATIONS / AUDITOR’S REPORT / GET IN TOUCHHOW WE REPORT

MATRIX IN 2018 
In spring 2017, we launched our updated 
sustainability strategy, developed in 
close cooperation with several external 
and internal key stakeholders, part -
ners and experts. In connection to this, 
we arranged a large-scale stakeholder 
meeting inviting over 300 represent -
atives from our stakeholder commu -
nities to a full day of workshops and 
discussions, including feedback on our 
report and the focus areas chosen in 
our strategy.In 2017 we conducted our first stake -
holder survey developed with Business 
for Social Responsibility (BSR). The 
survey assesses both the quality of 
our stakeholder engagement work, as 
well as feedback on our strategy and 
performance towards it. For this year ’s 
survey, the feedback we received widely 
confirmed our materiality matrix, 
with some adjustments made, such as 
an increased focus on inclusion and 
diversity.
PROCESS FOR DEFINING OUR  
SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES
We started the process by defining 
who we impact through our business 
activities along our value chain. We 
paid special attention to those who are 
potentially more vulnerable and hence 
are more at risk, such as migrant work -
ers, women and children. This map -
ping process resulted in a list of both 
potential and actual human rights 
impacts. From this list, we identified 
salient impacts by applying two crite -
ria: the severity of the potential impact 
and the likelihood of occurrence.  
 
We then held internal and external 
consultations about the method and 
input to the identified salient human 
rights issues with almost 100 people. 
Internally, we conducted workshops and 
opened dialogues across all levels and 
functions of our company. Externally, 
we held consultations with experts, 
organisations, academia and local stake -
holders. We review our salient human 
rights issues annually and adjust them 
accordingly. For an update on our salient 
human rights issues, read more here .

The H & M Group Sustainability Report 
2018 covers the period 1 December 2017 
– 30 November 2018.
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY
The Management of H & M is respon -
sible for preparing and presenting the 
H   & M Group Sustainability Report 
2018 in accordance with the reporting 
criteria as set out in the company’s own 
reporting guidelines as well as the Global 
Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards. 
As discussed in the section “How we 
report”, page 100 in the H & M Group 
Sustainability Report 2018, greenhouse 
gas quantification is subject to inher -
ent uncertainty because of incomplete 
scientific knowledge used to determine 
emissions factors and the values needed 
to combine emissions of different gases. 
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a con -
clusion on the above specified indica -tors in the H & M Group Sustainability 
Report based on the limited assurance 
procedures we have performed. The 
selection of indicators to be reviewed has 
been made by the management of H & M 
Hennes & Mauritz AB. We do not accept, 
nor assume responsibility to anyone 
else, except to H & M for our work, for 
the limited assurance report, or for the 
conclusion that we have reached. 
We conducted our limited assurance 
engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 ‘Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Infor -
mation’. The ISAE 3000 standard 
requires that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the 
assurance engagement to obtain limited 
assurance on whether any matters have 
come to our attention that would cause 
us to believe that the above specified 
information in the H & M Group Sus -
tainability Report 2018 has not been 
prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the reporting criteria.
A limited assurance engagement is 
provided only on the information dis -
closed in the H & M Group Sustainability 
Report, not on information linked to and 
disclosed on other web pages. The pre -sented information in the H & M Group 
Sustainability Report is to be consid -

information on data collection, consol -
idation and assessments provided by 
H  &   M. This independent limited assur -
ance report should not be used on its 
own as a basis for interpreting H & M’s 
performance in relation to its principles 
of corporate responsibility.
Our review procedures are designed to 
obtain limited assurance on whether 
the above specified indicators are 
presented in accordance with the 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of 
the Global Reporting Initiative, in all 
material respects. A limited assurance 
engagement consists of making inquir -
ies, primary of persons responsible for 
the preparation of the H & M Group
