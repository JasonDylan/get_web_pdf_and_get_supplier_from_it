the World’s 
To-Do ListWe have work because our customers value our high-quality communications 
services . We deliver superior customer experiences through our products and 
our actions. Everything we do we build on a strong network, systems and process 
foundation. The quality and reliability of the products we deliver are paramount. 
Customers pay us to provide them with services that they can rely on.
We focus outward on the customer, not inward.  We make it easy for customers 
to do business with us, by listening, anticipating and responding to their needs. 
We know our products and can explain them to customers. We focus on fundamental 
execution. We are accountable and we follow through with a sense of urgency. We 
know that having the highest ethical standards is a competitive advantage.
We know teamwork enables us to serve our customers better and faster. We 
embrace diversity and personal development not only because it’s the right 
thing to do, but also because it’s smart business.  We are driven not by ego but 
by accomplishments. We keep our commitments to each other and our customers. 
Our word is our contract. We respect and trust one another, communicating openly, 
candidly and directly since any other way is unfair and a waste of time. We voice our 
opinion and exercise constructive dissent, and then rally around the agreed-upon 
action with our full support. Any one of us can deliver a view or idea to anyone else, 
and listen to and value another’s view regardless of title or level. Ideas live and die 
on their merits rather than where they were invented.
We believe integrity is at the core of who we are. It establishes the trust that is 
critical to the relationships we have. We are committed to do the right thing and 
follow sound business practices in dealing with our customers, suppliers, owners 
and competitors. Our competitors are not enemies; they are challengers who drive 
us to improve. We are good corporate citizens and share our success with the 
community to make the world in which we work better than it was yesterday.
We know that bigness is not our strength, best is our strength. Bureaucracy 
is an enemy. We fight every day to stay “small” and keep bureaucracy out. We are 
more agile than companies a fraction of our size, because we act fast and take 
risks every day. We see crisis and change as opportunities, not threats. We run to a 
crisis, not away. Change energizes us. We work hard, take action and take personal 
accountability for getting things done. Our actions produce measurable results.
Everything we do is built on the strong foundation of our corporate values.  
We work 24x7 because our customers depend on us 24x7. We know our best was 
good for today. Tomorrow we’ll do better.Who

WE ARE VERIZON
Integrity / Respect / Performance Excellence / Accountability
We are pleased to present Verizon’s 
2010–11 Corporate Responsibility 
Report, “Tackling the World’s To-Do  
List. ”  You will see in these pages the 
progress we’ve made over the past year  
in the areas that define our approach  
to corporate responsibility and meet  
just a few of the thousands of Verizon 
people who give life and meaning to 
these priorities. The actions in this report 
reflect Verizon’s steady, concerted efforts 
to use technology to address some of  
our society’s most urgent issues. 
More broadly, they are the latest steps 
in our continuing journey to expand the 
area of intersection between Verizon’s 
business interests and those of society  
as a whole.
Officially, this journey began in 2004 
with the launch of our formal corporate 
responsibility initiative, but the impulse 
to have a positive impact on society has 
animated our company across its more than 125-year history. Communications 
is by definition a deeply social enterprise, 
and the belief that what we do—connect 
people and communities, provide great 
products and services, and invest in inno -
vative technology that fuels commerce 
and drives growth—is inherently valuable 
lies at the heart of our company’s mission. 
Our approach to corporate responsibil -
ity derives from this fundamental belief, 
which gives it integrity and connects it 
to what we do in the marketplace every 
day. With that legacy as our starting point, 
we built a disciplined process for creating 
a values-based culture and channeling 
those impulses into actions that produce 
measurable benefits to society. 
Our top priority—then and now—is to 
make sure we run our own company right. 
Therefore, our first action was to codify 
the values by which all our employees 
live and implement an extensive ethics 
and compliance program to reinforce Message from 
the Chairman
that culture throughout Verizon. 
Over the years we have extended our 
values system through a supplier code 
of conduct and employee Credo to 
guide our global interactions. We work 
hard to create a safe, stimulating and 
diverse work environment that allows 
employees to reach their full potential. 
In keeping with our long tradition of 
volunteerism, we encourage our people 
to contribute their time and money to 
our communities, which they have done 
in amazing numbers—volunteering 
nearly 4.2 million hours since 2004, the 
equivalent of nearly 480 years of service. 
We also focus on being good stewards 
of our own resources, setting aggressive 
energy efficiency targets for ourselves and 
our suppliers, developing green products 
and technologies, recycling products and 
taking active measures to reduce our own 
environmental impact.
Next, we needed to build the right system 
for organizing our corporate responsibility 
efforts and holding ourselves accountable 
for results: 
       We established a Corporate Respon-  
sibility Council—led by two senior 
officers, overseen by the board of 
directors and populated by leaders 
from across the business—to set 
priorities, performance targets and 
measurements. 
       We also created a Consumer Advisory 
Board and Strategic Alliances pro -
gram to maintain a constant dialogue 
with our stakeholders and act as an 
early warning system for emerging 
issues and customer concerns. 
Smart networks will help 
spread collaboration and 
innovation on a global 
scale, Chairman and CEO 
Ivan Seidenberg said in his 
keynote address at the 2011 
International Consumer 
Electronics Show. 
2       Most recently, we established 
Verizon’s first formal sustainability 
program under the leadership of a 
chief sustainability officer. 
With the systems in place to give us 
good inputs and market intelligence, 
developing the priorities for our corporate 
responsibility efforts came naturally. 
We instinctively believed that the 
Internet would transform education and 
developed an online learning resource 
called Thinkfinity  that has become one 
of the most trusted educational sites on 
the Internet. Our wireless employees felt 
strongly that mobile technology could 
empower women to escape the scourge 
of domestic violence and created our 
signature program, HopeLine® , to raise 
resources and awareness of this issue. Our 
customers tell us they’re concerned about 
issues of privacy and safety when it comes 
to the use of technology, motivating us 
to provide parental controls, take the lead 
in preventing distracted driving, educate 
communities about online safety and do 
groundbreaking research in cybercrime. 
And our business focus on increasing 
broadband availability led naturally to 
our commitment to accessibility, which 
has resulted in an increasing number of 
products tailored for seniors and people 
with physical challenges.
We continue to expand our view of  
how to use our technology to deliver 
both business and social value. As 
mobile and broadband technologies 
permeate every dimension of modern 
life,  we are constantly exploring busi-
ness opportunities that leverage these 
transformational technologies for social 
purposes. Already, we’re working with utility companies to create smart grids 
that maximize energy efficiency. We’re 
working with partners in our innovation 
labs on new products and applications 
for home energy management, remote 
health care monitoring, video confer-
encing and accessible products. 
You’ll learn about these and many more 
accomplishments in this report. Our 
process works because it’s connected to 
the core of what we do. Communications 
technology really does solve problems  
for people and for society. Our consistent  
and disciplined approach keeps us 
focused on results, holds us accountable 
for meeting our commitments and assures 
that our actions live up to our words. Most 
important, our people really do believe  
in the value of our work, a commitment 
that spans every level of our company. 
I am confident that my successor, Lowell 
McAdam, will bring fresh energy and 
new ideas to our corporate responsibility 
initiatives when I retire as Verizon’s chief 
executive officer and chairman later this 
year. Lowell’s thumbprint on our culture 
is already evident in the Verizon Credo, 
which we introduced company-wide in 
2011 and which you can read on page 
one of this book. In it, we reinforce our 
belief that building long-term business 
and social value is at the heart of what  
we do: “ We are good corporate citizens  
and share our success with the community 
to make the world in which we work better 
than it was yesterday. ”  I know Lowell will 
challenge the next generation of Verizon 
leaders to find a “higher gear”—to use 
one of his favorite phrases—when it 
comes to putting our technology to  
work for society.At Verizon, we have spent the last  
10 years building a foundation for 
success in the wireless and broadband 
era. We’ve invested in technology, 
expanded our innovative capacity  
and sharpened our skills, maintaining 
that focus on investment, innovation  
and execution through good times and 
bad in our quest for long-term value 
creation. In the process, we’ve changed 
our own growth trajectory and created 
new opportunities across the whole 
industry. And while we’re a different 
company than we were a decade ago—
more high-tech, more mobile, more 
global—we have built our success on 
a culture of integrity and fundamental 
values that have united our company 
throughout its history.
I am proud to have had the opportunity 
to work with the thousands of Verizon 
colleagues who have made corporate 
responsibility a dynamic force at our 
company. With their passion for service 
and their can-do spirit, they have inspired 
and challenged me every day of my career. 
Together, we have built a solid foundation 
for creating value that will generate 
expanding returns for our communities 
as well as our customers. The more deeply 
embedded technology becomes in our 
society, the more these opportunities to 
create shared success will grow.
I can’t wait to see what happens next.

opportunity as well as new 
risks, like cyberbullying and 
data theft. That’s why we offer 
online safety tools for families 
and advanced encryption for 
businesses and government.At Verizon, we bring our commitment to execution and 
operational excellence to everything we do, including 
corporate responsibility.
Our disciplined process focuses on understanding what 
matters to stakeholders and how they are affected by our 
decisions, setting clear objectives and measuring our progress.  
The result is a record of turning goals into concrete 
achievements and an expanding circle of shared success  
for our employees, customers and communities. Focusing

reviews.
• Regular “town hall” meetings and 
operations reviews led by senior 
executives and managers.
• Quarterly broadcasts conducted  
by the chairman and the chief 
operating officer to discuss results 
and unit performance. The sessions 
are web-cast across the company. 
Senior executives conduct companion 
webcasts each quarter that focus  
on departmental performance.
• Employee opinion surveys, which  
are conducted every two years,

34Our Support for the Military
Since 2001 more than 1,000 Verizon 
employees have been called to active 
duty in the military and National Guard. 
Many have served in Afghanistan and 
Iraq, while others have played crucial 
roles during the aftermath of Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita. Some 109 employees  
are currently on emergency military leave. 
Verizon is proud to support these 
employees and the military with a  
range of benefits and programs:
       For employees who are called to 
active military duty, Verizon pays the 
difference between the employee’s 
military pay and Verizon pay for up to 
36 months. We also continue medical, 
dental and group life insurance for 
those employees and their depen -
dents. Service and pension credits 
continue for the entire leave.        For leaves of 90 days or less, employees 
generally will be reinstated to the 
same job. Those on leave for more 
than 90 days generally will be 
reinstated to a similar job if the  
same job is not available.
       The Verizon Foundation has enlisted  
38 Verizon employees to serve as 
mentors to military veterans via the 
American Corporate Partners group. 
Computers and adaptive technology 
have been provided to severely 
disabled veterans.

Solutions for Improved Health Care
To say the health care industry faces 
unprecedented changes would be an 
understatement. From shifts in demo-  
graphics and technologies, to government 
reforms and increased expectations for  
care, health care organizations are con-  
fronting significant challenges. 
Many of the critical steps for improved 
care depend on fostering collaboration 
and getting the right information into the 
right hands—when and where it’s needed. 
We’re adapting our broadband and mobile 
technologies to help provide new answers 
to some longstanding challenges in health 
care and accessibility.
   To accelerate the sharing of electronic 
data in the health care field, Verizon 
began issuing free medical identity

38   A large hurdle to creating an effective 
national electronic health records  
system is the inability of health care 
providers to share the wide range  
and volume of clinical notes that  
are produced annually. Verizon’s  
Medical Data Exchange solves that 
problem by providing a platform that 
enables medical transcription firms  
to share digitized clinical documents 
between doctors, hospitals and other 
health care providers nationwide. 
• Our first-of-its-kind platform uses a 
central directory to verify the identities 
of senders and recipients. To provide 
added security and protection, infor -

Preparing Students for Success
Today’s educational process occurs on 
campus, off campus, around the world and 
around the clock. Teachers must interact 
with their students through a variety of 
communication technologies, tapping the 
limitless amount of information available 
online while collaborating and sharing 
information quickly and easily. 
The pressure to do more with less and the 
sheer pace of technological innovation 
make it difficult for educators to sort 
through all of the complexity. This is 
where Verizon can make a difference. We’re focused on using technology  
to improve education, particularly in  
ways that help prepare students for  
the high-tech, intensely collaborative  
21st century workplace. 
   Our signature education activity is 
Verizon Thinkfinity—an award-winning 
website of free teaching and learning

(PVC and BFR) that some believe 
could have harmful health effects. 
The packaging is made from 80% 
post-consumer recycled paper and 
the user manual is made using 100% 
recycled paper and soy-based ink. 
   We have partnered with Duke Energy 
to provide the telecommunications 
network that will connect the digital 
meters, signs and media players that 
will be used in Envision: Charlotte, a

Reducing Our Impact on  
the Environment
  Verizon has been tracking its energy 
usage and efficiency since 2001.  
To gauge our performance, we’ve 
annually calculated and reported a 
standard carbon-intensity figure—  
the ratio of our greenhouse gas 
emissions, or CO2, per million dollars 
in revenue. 
• This metric has been only marginally 
useful because it does not account 
for efficiency improvements that 
accompany growth in wireless, data 
and video services.
  In 2010, we developed a new metric  
that shows the carbon emissions  
that result from moving a terabyte  
of information across our networks 
(see inset). In this way, we can 
adequately assess how we are 
becoming more energy efficient,  
even as our business expands. 21

  In 2010, Verizon improved carbon  
efficiency by more than 15% versus 
2009 (see chart on page 50). 
• We intend to report our carbon-
intensity efficiency results every  
year in addition to energy usage  
and CO2 emissions. 
Making Our Buildings Greener
  In October 2010, Verizon Wireless  
was accepted into the U.S. Green 
Building Council’s Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) Volume Program.
• Thirty-two Verizon Wireless stores  
have earned LEED certification.
• LEED certification indicates a  
building was designed and built 
to ensure energy savings, water 
efficiency, CO2 emissions reduction, 
improved indoor environmental 
quality and effective stewardship  
of resources.
• Certification of these 32 stores is 
equivalent to diverting 763 tons of 
construction waste away from landfills, 
reducing water consumption by an 
estimated 864,000 gallons per year and 
saving an estimated 386,000 kilowatt 
hours of electricity per year.
  Verizon Wireless has received the  
Environmental Protection Agency’s 
(EPA) ENERGY STAR ® certification for 
upgrading 85 of its retail stores, earn -
ing the designation as an EPA Energy 
Star Partner.   Verizon tested a new system for regu -
lating the temperature in three data 
centers during 2010. The new system 
uses sensors, wireless controllers and 
software  to ensure optimum equip -
ment cooling. Results from the trials 
suggest the new design can reduce 
energy consumption from 5% to 9%.  
Plans are to expand the new system 
to 23 additional data centers in 2011, 
which projects to a savings of approx -
imately 42 million kilowatt hours at 
full implementation. 21 For more information on our efforts to reduce our environmental

Georgia was one of more 
than 1,500 employees 
from across Verizon who 
volunteered in 2010 to 
host recycling events 
and implement energy-
efficiency programs at  
their offices. The recycling 
events collected more  
than 170,000 pounds  
of used materials. 
  In 2010 we conducted trials of four  
different “smart” building systems at  
16 Verizon locations. The result was a 
26.7 million kilowatt hour reduction  
in energy usage and a savings of $2.1 
million, projected annually. The “smart” 
building program will expand to a 
total of 250 buildings in 2011. 
49Verizon collects global emissions data every year. Our profile is based 
on The Greenhouse Gas Protocol®, a widely used accounting framework 
developed by the World Resources Institute and used by governments 
and businesses worldwide to quantify and manage emissions. 22 
Our profile includes what this framework defines as Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 sources and calculations using emission factors provided by 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Environmental 
Information Agency (EIA).  
 Scope 1: Represents direct emissions from the fuel used by our fleet  
and to heat our buildings.  The EPA and the EIA emission factors vary 
based on the type of fuel used, e.g., 8.8 kg of CO2 per gallon of gasoline, 
10.1 kg of CO2 per gallon of diesel fuel and 8.1 kg of CO2 per gallon for 
B20 Biodiesel.
 
 Scope 2: Represents indirect emissions based on electricity used. For 
our 2008 and 2009 reporting, we used the EPA’s eGRID National profile 
factors. For 2010, we used the more precise EPA eGRID Subregion 
profile, which calculates CO2 emissions per kWh based on unique 
regional factors.Carbon

54The tragic conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which 
has persisted since the early 1990s, involves militants who exert 
control over mineral deposits as a source of financing. 
Those mineral resources—specifically tin, tantalum and tungsten 
ores—are key elements of consumer electronics products such  
as cell phones, personal computers and MP3 players.
While Verizon does not buy raw materials, manufacture devices, 
or produce any electronic equipment directly, we recognize that 
we have a responsibility to ensure that all of our products are 
responsibly manufactured by our suppliers. Our Supplier Code  
of Conduct and Human Rights Statement (see page 20) make  
clear we strive to create an environment of respect, integrity  
and fairness for our employees and customers wherever we  
do business. We expect that our business partners will operate  
the same way. 
 
As a member of the Global eSustainability Initiative (GeSI), Verizon 
supports the organization’s process to eliminate conflict minerals 
in the consumer electronics supply chain. GeSI members are taking 
action through:
 Increasing supply chain transparency;
  Developing and piloting an auditing process for smelters  
to validate conflict-mineral-free components; and
  Engaging with other stakeholders for collaboration  
and efficiency.Eliminating Conflict

64In keeping with Verizon’s commitment to protect the environment and support for  
responsible forest management practices, we engaged a printer for the production of  
the Corporate Sustainability Report that is 100% wind powered, and is an EPA Green  
Power Partner and EPA Climate Leader.   
The Corporate Sustainability Report was printed on New Leaf Reincarnation Matte 95#  
cover and 80# text, which are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and contain  
100% recycled fiber made with 60% post-consumer waste.
