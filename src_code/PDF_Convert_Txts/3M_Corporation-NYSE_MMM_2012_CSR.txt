3M Sustainability Definition  
3M defines sustainability using the United 
Nation’s Brundtland Commission’s 
definition, "meeting the needs of society 
today while respecting the ability of future 
generations to meet their needs." Our 
definition is further informed by the work for 
the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Developm ent, Global Reporting Initiative, 
Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and others 
who define sustainability as encompassing 
environmental stewardship, economic 
success, and social responsibility.  These 
three pillars are further defined by the topics 
covered in this report.

 I
NTRODUCTION  
 
INVENTING TOMORROW  -SUSTAINING OUR FUTURE  
 
3M does not have a separate 
sustainability initiative.  
 
It is simply part of who we are and 
what we do.  
 Initiatives speak of focus groups… of 
start-up dates… end dates… 
buzzwords.  They tend to spring from 
what other companies do.  They are a 
reaction.  
 For more than 40 years, 3M has been 
a leader among global corporations in 
sustainability actions and measures, 
beginning with the creation of its 
ground- breaking Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) Program in 1975  to a broad portfolio of 
sustainable product s today.  
 
As a global corporation, we believe that we have a very real and sincere  responsibility to 
society, in general, and especially to the communities in which we live and work.  That is 
important from an environmental stewardship perspective, as well as a key competitive strategy.  
 
Our corporate vision states that  3M technology advances every company…  
3M products enhance every home… and 3M innovation improves every life.    
 
It is that vision – that focuses  on our customers’ needs and well -being – that guides our 
sustainability strategies and goals, the respect we demonstrate for our social and physical 
environments.  
 
Our sustainability strategies are built upon three key principles: environmental stewardship, 
social responsibility, and economic success.  By demonstrating global leadership within each of these powerful principles, 3M will continue to successfully deliver on its corporate vision.  
 Our f ocus on environmental stewardship dictates how we do what we do.  It guides our design 
ethic, our manufacturing processes, and our means of distribution.  
 
Our focus on social responsibility means engaging in deep, meaningful conversations with our 
key stakeholders –  our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and our communities –  to 
ensure that we are acting as responsibly and as ethically as possible and that we are furthering 
our leadership position within our sustainability operations.  
 
6 
 Our focus on economic success enables us to create impactful, innovative sustainable solutions 
today… and far into the future.  
 Our corporate vision, crafted with our customers and end users firmly in mind, is inextricably 
linked with our sustainability strategies.  Our culture of innovation, collaboration, the sharing  of 
technologies across platforms and business units, ultimately supports these guiding questions:  
How can we best meet the articulated and unarticulated needs of our global customers and 
partners?  How can we harness the chain reaction of new ideas to not only invent the products 
of the future, but also do so in a way that creates the smallest footprint upon our precious 
planet?   
 
Our sustainability measures begin with t he germ of an idea and are carried through every step 
of processes that deliver innovative products into the hands of our customers throughout the world.  Our partners and customers consistently turn to us for sustainability solutions within their 
own manu facturing processes.  We share our knowledge regularly and to the greater benefit of 
the worldwide community.  
 
We know that what we and our partners do today will have an impact far into the future.  We act 
to meet the needs of society today, while respect ing the needs of future generations.  
 At 3M, we don’t have a sustainability initiative.  
We ha ve a sustainability culture.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
EXECUTIVE MESSAGE  
At 3M, we are working hard to help create a better world for people everywhere. We apply our 
ingenuity, our expertise and our technology to solve problems innovatively, and with a focus on 
solutions for the longer term. Sustainability is fundamental to our  business philosophy –  from 
product development and manufacturing to how customers use our products.   
 
Our Enduring Commitment  
For decades, 3M has pioneered sustainable business practices with outstanding results. Our 3P 
Program – Pollution Prevention Pays —is now in its thirty -seventh year. Over the years, this 
innovative, world- leading program has prevented 3.5 billion pounds of pollution. And that’s not 
all - our efforts have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 72 percent.  
 We have created hundreds of sustainable solutions and product platforms to help our customers 
manage their environmental footprint – from paint systems that reduce the need for cleaning 
solvents and window films that ease energy consumption to a greener tape that is made with plant -based adhesive and film.  
 But we know there is much more to do.  3M and its customers face ongoing challenges such as 
energy reduction and efficient use of raw materials.  When we look upon these challenges, we 
apply 3M innovation to overcome them, for our  company, for our customers and for our 
communities.  
 
Our 2015 Sustainability Goals  
Sustainability is a real -world business initiative that is woven into the culture of 3M.  
We are building on our years of success to further reduce our environmental footpri nt. Our goal 
is to reduce volatile air emissions 15 percent by 2015, reduce solid waste 10 percent and 
improve energy efficiency by 25 percent, all from a 2010 base.  
 Our sustainability goals also measure progress on social responsibility and economic iss ues. 
For example, we aim to increase sales of 3M products that offer environmental advantages and 
we are developing and implementing water conservation plans in areas with scarce or stressed 
water resources.  
  
Sustainability will continue to be a vital focus as we work to truly advance every company, 
enhance every home and improve every life.

3M BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
3M’s Board Structure and leadership are  characterized by : 
 
• A combined Chairman of the Board and CEO (Inge Thulin) . 
• A  strong, independent and highly experienced  lead director with well defined 
respons ibilities that support the Board’s oversight responsibilities  (Vance Coffman)  
• A robust committee structure comprised entirely of independent directors with oversight 
of various types of risks  
• An engaged and independent Board.  
 
The Board of Directors (the “Board”)  believes that this leadership provides independent Board 
leadership and engagement while deriving the benefit of having our CEO also serve as 
Chairman of the Board.  As the individual with primary responsibil ity for managing the 
company’s day to day operations and with in depth know ledge and understanding of the 
company, he is best positioned to chair regular Board meetings as the directors discuss key 
business and strategic issues.  Coupled with an independent Lead Director, this combined 
structure provides independent oversight while avoiding unnecessary confusion regarding the 
Board’s oversight r esponsibilities and the data to day management of business operations.  
 The board believes that the c ompany’s corporate governance measures ensure that strong 
independent directors conti nue to effectively oversee the c ompany’s management and key 
issues related to executive compensation, CEO evaluation and succession planning, st rategy, 
risk and integrity.  
 
 12 
  
 Board Skills and Responsibilities  
The Board's Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews with the 3M board the 
requisite skills and characteristics of its members. 3M's Corporate Governance Guidelines 
contain Board Membership Criteria that apply to nominees for a position on 3M's Board of 
Directors. The committee periodically reviews with the board the appropriate skills and 
characteristics required of board members given the current board composition. It is the intent of 
the board that the board, itself, be a high performance organization creating competitive 
advantage for 3M. To perform as such, the board is composed of individuals who have 
distinguished records of leadership and success in their arena  of activity and who will make 
substantial contributions to board operations and effectively represent the interests of all 
stockholders.  
 The Committee’s and the Board’s assessment of Board candidates includes, but is not limited 
to, consideration of:  
• Roles and contributions valuable to the business community;  
• Personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment, and whether the candidate 
possesses and maintains throughout service on the Board a reputation in the community 
at large of integrity, trust, re spect, competence, and adherence to the highest ethical 
standards;  
• Relevant knowledge and diversity of background and experience in such things as business,  manufacturing, technology, finance and accounting, marketing, international 
business,  government, and the like; and  
• Whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time required for preparation,  
participation, and attendance at all meetings.  
 
In addition to these minimum  requirements, the Committee will also evaluate whether the 
nominee’s  skil ls are complementary to the existing Board members’ skills, the Board’s needs 
for particular  expertise in fields such as business, manufacturing, technology, finance and 
accounting, marketing, international business, government, or other areas of expertis e, and 
assess the nominee’s impact on Board dynamics and effectiveness.  
 
The Board of Directors values diversity as a factor in selecting nominees to serv e on the Board, 
and believes that the diversity which exists in its composition provides significant benefit to the 
Board and the  Company. Although there is no specific policy on diversity, the Committee 
considers the Board Membership Criteria in selecting nominees for directors, including 
‘‘diversity of background.’’ Such considerations may include gender , race, national origin, 
functional background, executive or  professional experience, and international experience.  
S
HAREHOLDER AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT  
3M values shareholder and stakeholder input.  The Board of Directors has adopted the following process for  stockholders and other interested parties to send communications to 
members of the Board. Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Lead Director, the chairs of the Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and 
Governance Commi ttees of the Board, or with any of our other independent directors,  
or all of them as a group, by sending a letter to the following address: Corporate Secretary, 3M  
Company, 3M Center, Building 220- 13E-34, St. Paul, MN 55144- 1000 
 13 
  
SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANC E STRUCTURE  
The Corporate Operating Committee, which is comprised of the CEO and his direct reports, 
approves 3M -wide sustainability principles, strategy, and goals, and any associated major 
changes . Executive committees associated with the strategic sustainability functions (comprised 
of cross functional members) help set and approve relevant policies and provide direction on 
executing the developed sustainability strategies.  
For example, the EHS Committee, appointed by the Corporate Operating Committee is 
composed of the following functions:  
• Senior vice president of corporate supply chain operations  
• Executive v ice president of research and development and chief technology officer  
• Vice president of EHS o perations  
• Vice president of public affairs  
• Vice president of corporate research laboratory and international technical operations  
• Vice president and medical director medical department  
• Vice president of compliance and business conduct  
• Vice president and general m anager of Materials Resource Division  
• Technical director of the Mater ials Resource Division  
• Assistant general council  
 
3M's Corporate Environmental Initiatives and Sustainability Group within the Environmental , 
Health, and Safety corporate staff organization collaborate with the various other global staff 
organizations and business units to develop the corporate sustainability strategy and goals.  In 
addition 3M’s all corporate staff groups provide additional technical expertise to assist business 
units  and area management  in implementing and meeting  the corporate sustainabili ty strategy, 
policies, and goals.
Identifying Opportunities & Risks Related to Sustainable Development  
While  the Board of Directors primary oversight of risk is with the Audit Committee, the Board 
has delegated to other committees the oversight of risks within their areas of responsibility and 
expertise. For example, the Finance Committee oversees risks associated with the Company’s 
capital structure, its credit ratings and its  cost of capit al, long -term benefit obligations, and the 
Company’s use of or investment in financial products, including derivatives used to manage risk related to foreign currencies, commodities, and interest rates. The Nominating and Governance 
Committee oversees the risks associated with the Company’s overall governance and its 
succession planning process to understand that the Company has a slate of future, qualified 
candidates for key management positions. T he Compensation Committee oversees the risks 
associated wit h the Company’s compensation practices, including an annual review of the 
Company’s risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices for its employees.  
 The Board believes that its oversight of risks, primarily through delegation to the Audit 
Committee,  but also through delegation to other committees to oversee specific risks within their 
areas of  responsibility and expertise, and the sharing of information with the full Board, is 
appropriate for a  diversified technology and manufacturing company like 3M. 3M conducts 
extensive interviews, group assessments, and reviews by senior management for completion of risk analysis assessments to  provide more customized and useful prioritized results.  This 
process assures that  the appropriate risks are properly identified as an enterprise risk, to 14 
 identify key “failure modes” that could lead to a risk incident, and to review and assess the 
quality of ownership of the risk and related resources available to assure proper avoidance, 
mitigation, and response capabilities.  A gap assessment is completed  to provide quantification 
on a common scale of the level of risk and 3M’s corresponding capabilities relative to each enterprise risk identified. The outcomes are us ed to prioritize action plans for each topic. More 
detailed quantitative and qual itative sensitivity analyses may be conducted and cover topics 
such as  operational risk (business continuity), raw material sourcing and price fluctuation, 
compliance, revenue forecasting , regulatory legislation,  pricing and st rategic planning 
processes, among many other areas. The chair of each committee that oversees  risk provides a 
summary of the matters discussed with the committee to the full Board following each 
committee  meeting. The minutes of each committee meeting are also provided to all Board 
members.  
 The Board also believes its oversight of risk is enhanced by its current leadership structure 
(discussed  above) because the CEO, who is ultimately responsible for the Company’s 
management of risk, also chairs regular Board meetings, and with his in- depth knowledge and 
understanding of the Company, is  best able to bring key business issues and risks to the 
Board’s attention.  
 
The Board of Directors Public Issues Committee review public policy issues and trends affecting 
the company.  The committee reviews and approves the company’s response to stockholder 
proposals relating to public policy issues.  
 
The Board of directors has determined that all Public Issues Committee members are 
independent under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards.  
 
With complex global operations and a wide range of businesses and market s, developing 3M 
public policy priorities  can be a challenge. 3M manages this by working with local, national and 
international government agencies and through membership organizations. In the United States, 
an evaluation process developed by the 3M Public Affairs Department establishes a public 
policy agenda of issues impacting our businesses. Internationally, 3M managing directors of 
host country businesses are responsible for evaluating and determining key government issues 
in their respective countries.  PUBLIC POLICY  
 
Top Public Policy Issues 
The Top- 10 lis t of Priority Public Policy Issues serves as a roadmap for company activities to 
include lobbying, trade association work, executive involvement, political contributions, 
grassroots communications and advocacy involving employees and retirees, as well as 
meetings with federal and state government officials. In selecting which priority issues make 
3M's Top- 10 list, the company uses a number of screens. Chief among these screens are 
issues with the potential to significantly affect 3M's financial performance and/or our corporate 
reputation. Other screens are immediacy of impact on the company; situations in which 3M may 
be uniquely advantaged or disadvantaged; importance based on instinct and/or history; or 
employee/retiree satisfaction. This list of priorities helps the Corporate Public Affairs team focus 
on those issues that have the greatest impact on the company. Finally, and probably most 
importantly, the Top- 10 list of issues helps to ensure that the many faces of 3M always speak 15 
 with a single, unified voice and it serves as the guide for advancing 3M's public policy goals and 
growth -through -government objectives.  
  
Example: Top 10 3M Public Policy Issues in the United States (as of March 2012)  
 
(1) Tax Policy − Tax reform is essential to ensuring the long- term competitiveness of 
American businesses and workers. 3M believes business tax reform should focus on a 
significant reduction of the corporate income tax rate, transitioning to a territorial system, and 
creating incentives for U.S. -based IP ownership. In addition, state tax policy should incentivize 
capital investment and sustainable job creation by rewarding plant expansion and 
modernization investments, and efforts to increase employment.  
 
(2) Regulatory Reform − The U.S. regulatory environment plays a vital role in advancing 
the nation’s economic security interests. So as to promote genuine competition and sustainable 
job creation, regulatory reforms must include thorough cost -benefit and risk assessments, while 
preserving the highest standards for safety, quality and efficiency. Efforts by certain federal agencies to extend their regulatory reach without congressional oversight must also be 
curtailed.  
 
(3) Labor Policy –  3M supports the full measure of righ ts provided to employers and 
employees under the National Labor Relations Act. However, we strongly oppose recent 
actions by the National Labor Relations Board that challenge U.S. manufacturing leadership. In 
addition, we oppose any legislative or regulatory efforts to diminish or eliminate secret ballot 
elections for employees as relates to either accepting or rejecting union representation.  
 
(4) Sustainability/Environmental Policy  − 3M's strategies for sustainable development 
encompass the pursuit of cust omer satisfaction and commercial success within a framework of 
environmental, social and economic values.  To that end, 3M has made s ignificant investments  
designed to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations, investments which continue 
today . And by developing  sustainable products, we help our customers reduce their 
environmental footprint and help to meet their sustainability goals . Finally, 3M believes 
environmental policy and regulations should be guided by science -based decision making . 
 
 (5) Energy Policy –  National (and state) e nergy policy should ensure a continuous, reliable 
and uninterrupted supply of energy at competitive rates. 3M supports policies that address new 
sources of energy, alternative energy, faster adoption of technology  and improved energy 
efficiency . 
 
(6)  Health Care Policy –  The U.S. health system should remain market -driven and efforts 
to address the uninsured should not weaken the current employer -based coverage system. 3M 
believes i mplementation of the federal health care law should focus on increasing efficiencies 
within the system as well as improving quality outcomes and patient safety.  
 
(7) Legal Reform –  The U.S. legal system is the most expensive in the world, driven in 
large part by the wide- scale nature of lawsuit abuse. To ensure the legal justice system for 
businesses is fair, efficient and consistent, we support reforms making liability litigation more 
equitable, subjecting punitive damages to reasonable caps, and ending destructive practices 
such as indi scriminate screening, venue shopping and case bundling. Such reforms can be 
achieved without eroding the principle, which 3M supports, that those injured by faulty products 16 
 should receive fair compensation that is proportionate to the injury of the claimant and the fault 
of the defendant.  
 (8) Transportation Infrastructure Policy –  The maintenance and improvement of the 
nation’s transportation infrastructure –  which is important to 3M as a supplier of traffic safety 
and construction products, and as a user of the system – can only be achieved if the Highway 
Trust Fund remains solvent. 3M believes all highway user fees should be dedicated to the fund; 
additional steps should be taken to crack down on fuel tax evasion; and Congress should 
consider other measur es, if necessary, to ensure the fund’s solvency.  
 
(9) International Trade Policy  – The U.S. economy and American jobs depend on the 
expansion of free and fair trade through the passage of new trade agreements. Additionally, 3M 
supports renewal of the presi dent’s Trade Promotion Authority so as to allow additional 
agreements to be negotiated. International trade policy also requires a level playing field, including recognition, protection, and enforcement of intellectual property rights and trading 
rules.  
 
(10) Homeland Security  – 3M believes our nation’s homeland security and defense 
preparedness should be strengthened through improved border and immigration security, 
improved force protection measures, additional support for first responders, and planning for 
pandemics or other national emergencies.  
 
At 3M, we believe that what the company stands for is just as important as what we sell. For 
110 years, 3M has operated with uncompromising honesty and integrity.  3M’s global 
compli ance program is managed and adm inistered by the Compliance and 
Business  Conduct  department, led by the  vice president, Compliance and Business  Conduct, 
who is also the corporation’ s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”).  The department is staffed with 
compliance professionals stationed at company headquarters and around the world. The CCO 
reports to the Audit Committee of the 3M Board of Directors, which assists the Board in 
oversight o f 3M’s legal and regulatory compliance efforts. The Compliance and Business 
Conduct  department oversees and administers strategic, systematic and operational 
components of 3M’s compliance program design and implementation.  The compliance program 
is based on the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Its elements include:  BUSINESS CONDUCT  
 
• a core set of business conduct policies;  
• education and training materials and a schedule upon which compliance training is 
conducted;  
• periodic evaluations,  audits and measurements of the compliance program’s 
effectiveness;  
• a 24- hour helpline and website through which employees and others can report 
concerns and ask questions;  
• programs to conduct appropriate due diligence on business partners, potential and new acquisitions, and candidates f or hiring and promotion;  
• investigative expertise;  and, 
• incentives and discipline to address compliance successes and failures.  
 17 
 The Compliance and Business Conduct  department collaborates with and is assisted by 
dedicated compliance organizations and subject matter experts in the areas of corporate audit, 
corporate security, trade compliance, government contracting, health care regulatory, 
environmental health and safety and other  areas . In addition, 3M utilizes a network of 
Compliance Contacts in every business unit and staff group who assist the Compliance and Business Conduct  department in ensuring that their organizations continuously demonstrate 
legal compliance and ethical business conduct. Compliance C ontacts assist in business conduct 
policy traini ng, communications and completing periodic risk assessments for their 
organizations.  
 
Business Conduct Policies  
The Policies help employees and others acting on 3M’s behalf take a consistent, global 
approach to key compliance issues. 3M employees, including supervisors, managers and other 
leaders are responsible for understanding the legal and policy requirements that apply to their 
jobs and for reporting any suspected violations of law or these policies . 
 
Business Conduct Committee  
The 3M Business Conduct Committee is comprised of several senior executives and is chaired by 3M’s  vice president for Compliance and Business Conduct.  The Committee has oversight for 
3M’s  various compliance efforts. The Business Conduct Committee reports jointly to the Audit 
Com mittee of the 3M Board of Directors and to the Corporate Operati ng Committee.  
 Business Conduct Policies  
3M’s Business Conduct Policies are an important component of the company’s long 
tradition of compli ance.  Our Business Conduct Policies apply to all employees of the 
parent company and all subsidiaries throughout the world. They also apply to employees of 
joint ventures and other business affiliates in which 3M has a controlling interest. These 
global policies  apply to all locations and situations where 3M business is conducted and to 
all company -sponsored events. Although 3M has business operations in more than 65 
countries, there is only one set of Business Conduct Policies, available in multiple 
languages. The Policies help employees and others acting on 3M’s behalf take a 
consistent, global approach to key compliance issues. 3M employees, including 
supervisors, managers and other leaders are responsible for understanding the legal and 
policy requirements tha t apply to their jobs and for reporting any suspected violations of 
law or these policies.  
 
3M’s Anti -Bribery Policy requires compliance with all applicable anti -bribery laws, including the 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and all applicable local laws where 3M 
operates.  This p olicy applies to 3M employees and to our business partners who act on 3M’s 
behalf. This policy, and 3M -provided training, are designed to educate our employees and 
business partners how to recognize the many forms in which bribes can appear and how to 
avoid them , even at the risk of losing business opportunities.  
 
Compliance Training and Education  
3M offers a comprehensive online compliance training  program which is available to all 
employees worldwide. In addition to an  anti-bribery course, the program offers training in related 
areas such as business across borders, understanding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 
financial reporting, government relationships, business conduct, and other key compliance 
areas.  More than twenty five courses are offered in multiple languages. In addition, the 3M 18 
 internal Legal Affairs website offers additional anti -bribery training on 3M’s global anti -bribery 
compliance program.   
 
All courses are available for  employees to take at any time. However, 3M also requires certain 
employees to take specific  courses on a periodic basis.  To accomplish this, each course has a 
predetermined mandatory population based on employee job grade, job function and country 
location.  Course complet ion is tracked electronically when an employee takes the course and 
passes a quiz. Executives and managers are accountable for creating and promoting, by sound leadership and setting a good example, a workplace environment in which compliance and 
ethical business conduct are expected and encouraged.  
 
In addition to on- line training, the Compliance and Business Conduct department, in close 
collaboration with the Office of General Counsel, provides frequent, tailored in- person training to 
business, subsidiary  and staff groups, as requested or deemed appropriate.  
 
Dedicated Reporting System  
A 24-hour confidential and anonymous helpline  is available internally and externally through 
Ethics Point  (an independent 3
rd party firm) to report any business conduct concerns (see 3M 
Business Conduct weblink below).   Reports made through this system are promptly investigated 
and responded to by the Compliance and Business Conduct department or one of the other 
staff departmen ts.  In addition, 3M’s Non- Retaliation Policy prohibits retaliation against anyone 
who raises a business conduct concern in good faith or cooperates in a company investigation.  
 
Maintaining Business Conduct Compliance  
Operating with uncompromising honesty  and integrity is one of 3M’s core values and includes 
avoiding bribery or corru ption in any form.  One hundred percent  (100%)  of 3M’s businesses 
perform a business conduct self assessment every other year which includes an assessment of 
risks related to c orruption.  Calibrated based on transaction, geography and other risk factors, 
all of our business partners are subjected to reputational due diligence reviews.  Depending on the outcome, this process may also include training, inclusion of relevant contractual terms, and 
other mitigating controls.   3M’s businesses and subsidiaries undergo an array of audits on a 
regular schedule.  In addition, the Compliance and Business Conduct department collaborates 
with the Legal Affairs department  on pre-  and post -acquisition due diligence efforts and on 
extensive compliance reviews of selected businesses, based on a variety of risk factors.  
 
By setting and implementing policies and conducting assessments, 3M ensures that compliance 
and ethical business conduct compliance are maintained throughout the organization.

DENTIFYING KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND ASSESSING SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING 
MATERIALITY   
This report and 3M’s sustainability web site are the company’s primary mechanisms to 
communicate sustainability information (principles, policies, programs, challenges & 
opportunities, performance) to stakeholders. Therefore, defining the scope and content  of the 
remaining information  provided in this  report  is extremely import ant.  3M uses the following tools 
and mechanisms to help define our  Sustainability Report’s  content:  
 
• Identification of 3M stakeholders and 3M key actions and engagement  
• Stakeholder r elevancy evaluation of information provided  
• 3M’s sustainability k ey indicators materiality evaluation 
• Feedback from previous sustainability reports  
• Investor and customer i nterests  
• The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting guidelines  
 
3M participates and engages with numerous stakeholders regarding sustainability aspects and 
programs. The following resources provide guidance to the corporate stakeholder engagement 
process: AccountAbility’s AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard and “From Words to 
Action” The  Stakeholder Engagement Manual Volume 2: The Practitioner’s Handbook on 
Stakeholder Engagement created by AccountAbility, the United Nation’s Environment Programme, and Stakeholder Resear ch Associates 3M STAKE HOLDERS AND KEY ACTIONS AND ENGAGEMENT

We identify and evaluate sustainability aspects  and their associated key performance indicator s 
based on what is materially relevant and important  to 3M  to achieve long -term sustainable 
operations  [Note: Materiality for  the purposes of  sustainability reporting is not limited only to 
those sustainability topics that have significant financial impact  on the organization as defined 
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for financial reporting] .  In addition, the 
relevancy of the same aspects  and key performance indicators are  evaluated for  our identified  
global  stakeholders groups. Materialit y, as defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
guidelines, includes topics and indicators that reflect the organization’s significant economic, 
environmental, and social impacts or would substantively influence the assessments and 
decisions of stak eholders.  DETERMINING SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING MATERIALITY AND STAKEHOLDER RELEVANCY  
 
Key global societal trends (e.g. resource scarcity, emerging economies, growing/aging 
populations, poverty, technology shifts, and environmental i mpacts) along with 3M strategies, 
processes, GRI Indicators, and additional industry recognized key performance indicators are 21 
 factored and integrated into  the analysis.  The principles of materiality as defined by the AA1000 
Guidance on Materiality  and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI ) G.3.1  Materiality principles are 
applied throughout 3M’s evaluation process  and assist in prioritizing the level of materiality 
importance and  relevancy to our stakeholders of the recognized sustainability aspects : 
 
• Relevancy and importance to stakeholders (AA1000- Stakeholder Behavior and 
Concer ns) 
• Contribution and connection  to corporate strategies and core values (GRI -Strategy)  
• Level of direct financial impact -long term and short term (AA1000- Direct Financial 
Impact)  
• Relevancy of topic to industry section (AA1000 -Organizational Peer Based Norm s) 
• Level of connection to laws, regulations, international agreements with strategic 
significance to the organization or stakeholders (AA1000 Societal Norms)  
• Level of organization’s specialized knowledge to contribute to sustainability in focus area 
(AA100 0-Related Performance)  
OUR MATERIALITY MATRIX  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2011, this analysis was completed internally using 3M subject matter experts  with a range of 
perspectives and positions related to  each of the identified sustainability aspects and key 
performance indicators. Their input for stakeholder relevancy was based on 3M  interactions with 
the identified stakeholder groups. This evaluation was not done directly with a cross -functional 
team representing all stakeholder groups.  3M continues to incr ease engagement with our 
stakeholders both internally and externally and integrating the outcomes of those interacti ons 
into our s ustainability strategy  and processes . 
 An evaluation scheme of (9) Hi gh, (3) Medium, (1) Low, (0) Not Applicable for both relevancy 
and materiality importance with associated factors was utilized.    Aspects and related 
performance indicators that showed high relevancy/importance to stakeholders and/or  highly 
material /important for 3M (from a sustainability success perspective)  using the above criteria 
were considered as key elements  to include in the report.  
22 
  
For example, aspects relating to innovation, sustainable products, diversified workforce, and 
3M’s environmental footprint along with the respective associated key perfor mance indicators 
are both highly important and relevant to 3M and our stakeholders , therefore are addressed in 
this report.  
 
3M also included aspects that are either highly  important/material to 3M’s sustainability success 
but may not be as highly relevant  to all of our stakeholders (e.g. Occupational Safety and 
Health) and also those that are highly relevant to stakeholders but not as material to 3M’s 
sustainability success as other aspects (e.g. Biodiversity).  
 
Focusing and reporting on aspects that are most material to 3M’s sustainability success and 
also most  relevant to  our stakeholders will enhance and advance 3M’s sustainability  
performance and contribute to a more sustainable future .  This sustainability success starts with 
having a Sustainability V ision and Strategy.  
 
3M’ S SUSTAINABILITY VISION  AND STRATEGY  
 
3M's commitment is to actively contribute to sustainable development through environmental 
protection, social responsibility and economic progress. To us, that means meeting the needs of 
society today, while respecting the ability of future generations to meet their needs.  OUR SUSTAINABILITY VISION 
Strategic  Sustainability  Principles  
 
In 2008, 3M launched a project to develop three strategic 
principles around sustainability. 3M's strategies fo r 
sustainability encompass the pursuit of customer satisfaction and commercial success within a framework 
of environmental, social and economic values. These 
principles were developed to provide 3M businesses and 
corporate staff groups with a flexible fram ework to 
engage our customers and key stakeholders around sustainability including help our customers address 
environmental challenges through 3M products and 
technologies.  
 
• Economic Success : Build lasting customer relationships by developing differentiated, 
practical and ingenious solutions to their sustainability challenges.  
• Environmental Protection : Provide practical and effective solutions and products to 
address environmental challenges for ourselves and our customers.  
• Social Responsibility : Engage k ey stakeholders in dialogue and take action to improve 
3M’s sustainability performance.  
 
 
23 
  
For more than 100 years, 3M has achieved consistent, profitable growth by creating innovative 
products, establishing st rong relationships with customers and boosting operational efficiency. 
At the same time, we've created a culture that promotes employee pride and well -being, fosters 
integrity and supports social and environmental responsibility. Each year, 3M continues to move 
toward sustainability and strives to raise the bar on corporate environmental, social and 
economic management. In order to ensure continuous improvement, we annually reevaluate 
and/or identify new key sustainability objectives for the company.  3M’S KEY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  OBJECTIVES  
 
These  key issues are identified through 3M's management systems  (e.g. Enterprise Risk 
Management, EHS Management Systems, Human Resource  Management, Life Cycle 
Management, Supply Chain Management, Manufacturing and Operations Management ) and 
input and feedback from our stakeholders.  A few of 3M's key objectives regarding sustainable 
development include:  
• Manage our environmental footprint.  
• Develop solutions that address environmental and social challenges for our customers 
and society.  
• Assure  our products are safe for their intended use and throughout  their entire life cycle.  
• Assure  the appropriate management of any 3M health and safety issues that may impact  
customers, neighbors and the public.  
• Maintain  a safe and healthy workplace.  
• Satisf y our customers with superior quality and value.  
• Provide a supportive,  engaging, and flexible work environment.  
• Support  local needs and education in communities where 3M employees live and work.  
• Conduct our business with the uncompromising honesty and i ntegrity.  
• Provide an attractive return for our investors.  
Although 3M has been setting environmen tal goals and targets since 1990 , our new set of goals 
established in 2010 reflect all three pillars of Sustainability and include Environmental 
Stewardship, Social Responsibility, and Economic Success.  These goals and targets have 
been appr oved by the EHS Committee  and the Corporate Operating Committee .  A summary of 
results from previous goal periods are listed under the related sections within MANGEMENT 
APPROACH  and PERFORMANCE . 3M has made great progress in 2011 on each of the 2015 
goals and will continue to strive toward a more sustainability future for our company and those we serve.  OUR 2015  SUSTAINABILITY  GOALS AND TARGETS

SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND PERFORMANCE  
An innovative company cannot be built just on inanimate lab or mathematics alone.  It is built on 
a belief in the power of research and development, belief in our people and their work, and a 
deep conviction that the collective power of their imagination and creativity will generate future 
opportunity and financial betterment for the company .  ECONOMIC  SUCCESS  
 
In 2011, the following growth strategies were set for the company and highlight  expanding focus 
on relevancy to our customers, innovati on opportunities, regional self -sufficiency, diversity and 
operational excellence.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ACCELERATING  INNOVATION  
3M has a long standing reputation as 
being a company committed to 
innovation and dedicating a large 
percentage of revenue to research and 
development  (R&D)  around the world 
(2011- $1.5 billion (USD)) .  In addition to 
having extensive resources at the 
headquarters in Minnesota, 3M has 
been rapidly expanding operations 
around the world and now operates 
approximately 80 laboratories and technology centers globally. 3M 
continues to invest in R&D to drive 
global growth of the company with emphasis being placed on organic growth.  The increased 
R&D spending is reflected in the New Product Vitality Index (NPVI) which is currently at 32% 
27 
 and continues to increase. The NPVI is the percentage of net sales of pro ducts introduced 
within the last five years as compared to total net sales.  
 
Leveraging strategic partnerships with several external entities enables 3M to integrate a rich 
diversity of thinking and open innovation into superior technologies, business asse ts, and 
innovative products. The seven phase New Product Introduction process 3M uses provides  a 
robust framework for developing products from idea to launch.  Several other tools and systems 
are in place to promote , manage,  and evaluate the innovation process.  These include but are 
not limited to  technical committees , tracking systems, and customer interaction mechanisms . 
 
 
DRIVING GROWTH THROUGH NEW PRODUCTS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ADVANTAGES   
In 2010, 3M set a new goal as part of its 2015 sustainability goals to “further increase the sales 
of new products with environmental attributes.”  Progress towards this goal will be measured by 
looking at the percentage of sales in 3M’s New Product Vitali ty Index (NPVI) that come from 
products with an environmental attribute.   Environmental product i nnovations must meet all of 
these criteria: 1) Not pose any significant environmental, health, and safety concerns; 2) 
Environmental attribute must be relevant  to product type and market place; and 3)  Contain one 
or more of the 3M product environmental sustainability attributes.  Environmental a ttributes 
across the products entire lifecycle will be considered including:  
 
 Raw ma terials  
 Manufacturing  
 Product design  
 Customer use, and  
 Disposal (i.e. products that can be recycled).  
 Substantial additional guidance and evaluation criteria are used internally  to define which 
products qualif y.   In 2011, 3M began  initial tr acking of new products with environmental 
attributes in accordance to the guidance and criteria.

ACHIEVING CUSTOMER SATIS FACTION AND QUALITY  PRODUCTS  
 
Getting Closer to our Customers  
Serving our c ustomer base locally, while still maintaining a global network  is one of our  global 
strategies to drive innovation, strengthen local resources/suppliers, and better serve our 
customers around the world. We believe by moving the research and development process 
closer to our global customers we will develop products that more specifically address  the 
needs of the respect ive global markets .   That is why 3M has been working to develop local 
research and development and technical centers, increase our use of  local suppliers and build  
manufacturing capacity close r to customers .  
Today 3M has  
 3,700 technic al service staff wor king in many different countries  
 30 customer technical centers, including new ones in Dubai, Colombia, Malaysia, Del hi, 
Bangalore  28 
  35 R&D  laboratories, incl uding a new state of the art  lab in Bangalore, India 
 
Responding to Customers  
3M has a variety of mechanisms to listen, gather, and importantly act on feedback from 
customers in the marketplace. 3M’s main customer contact center is staffed 24/7 with trained 
personnel to direct customer inquiries to the correct resources.  The director of Corporate 
Qual ity and Lean Six Sigma has overall responsibility for customer satisfaction.  In addition, 
independent quality managers, not reporting to the manufacturing organization, staff each 
division. They review customer feedback with key stakeholder s and assure that all questions  
are addressed in a professional, timely, and effective manner.  
 
 Quality Management Systems and Products 
3M’s Corporate Quality Management and Quality Network are lead by the Strategic Quality 
Leadership Team supported by the Quality Council. The strategic quality leadership team sets 
strategy, identifies common opportunities for improvement, and directs global synergy across all 
business units within 3M.    The Quality Council includes all quality leaders from divisions, 
facilities, and countries where 3M has operations and responsible ensuring the deployment of 
best practices and the implementation of the Quality Management System company -wide.  
 From the purchase of raw materials through manufacturing, packaging, marketing, wholesale 
and retail sales, inventory control, distribution, service, and support, invoicing, collection, 
warranty claims and more, there are many opportunities for 3M to drive customer focused 
quality improvement along the entire chain of activities.  Satisfying our c ustomers with 
innovative technology and superior quality, value and service is one of 3M’s core values.  
 An effective Quality Management System assures that 3M has processes in place to produce 
products and deliver services that consistently meet customer requirements. As of year -end 
2011, 73% of sites have an ISO registered Quality Management System (ISO 9001, ISO 13485, 
TS 16949, TL9000, and AS9100) . 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL  STEWARDSHIP  
Environmental stewardship at 3M is based on the principle of providing practic al and effective 
solutions and products to address environmental challenges for both ourselves and for our 
customers.  Setting and implementing global environmental policies, management systems, and 
tracking and maintaining key performance metrics enables 3M to continually integrate and drive  
environmental stewardship throughout the organization.  
 
LONG HISTORY OF COMMI TMENT  
3M has been making continuous progress to ward reducing  the environmental impact of our 
products and associated processes .  In 1975, 3M’s commitment to environmental stewardship 
was formalized when the Board of Directors adopted the 3M Environmental Policy.  This global 
policy, still in effect today, is believed to be the first policy providing a framework with 
measureable r esults from a major manufacturing company.  It is a comprehensive statement of 
3M’s environmental commitment, emphasizing preventing pollution at the source. The executive 
Environmental, Health and  Safety (EHS) Committee, reporting to the Corporate Operati ng 
Committee provides oversight of 3M’s  environmental programs .  Environmental stewardship is 
integrated into each of the six business units globally ensuring consistency and innovative 29 
 environmental thinking.  As reflected by our environmental performance indicators  and 2015 
Sustainability Goals environmental stewardship is core corporate commitment backed by 
decades of proven performance.  
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS  
3M has extensive global environmental management systems in place to identify, track, and 
manage relevant information indicative of corporat e-wide environmental  performance .  These 
include management systems covering a full range of environmental compliance and 
performance metrics relevant to 3M operations, including the following critical elements  and 
further described below : 
• Environmental c ompliance management  
• Climate change management  
• Energy management  
• Air quality management  
• Waste management  
• Water management  
• Biodiversity management  
• Product l ife cycle management  
• Sustainable Packaging 
 
Information and performance data on a majority of these program elements is  tracked and 
reported on  through corporate electronic  reporting systems . 3M Environmental, Health, and 
Safety  scorecards published quarterly include environmental performance data at the facility, 
division, business unit, and corporate levels and are reviewed by executive management  for 
performance .  This enables  3M to monitor and identify successes, risk s, and opportuni ties for 
improvements and reductions worldwide.  
 
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  MANAGEMENT  
3M operations are subject to global environmental laws and regulations including those 
pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and 
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws and r egulations are enforceable by 
national, state and local authorities around the world. 3M strives to be 100% compliant with all global environmental requirements and regulations . 
 
3M‘s  multi- faceted strategy for i mplementing enviro nmental management s ystems  and global 
auditing of environmental compliance for our operations is key to understanding  any potenti al 
gaps and gain resolution quickly .   All manufacturing facilities are required to complete a Global 
Environmental Management Self -Assessment at least annually, which consists of a detailed 
evaluation of each facility's systems for ensuring environmental compliance and management 
system perfo rmance.  In addition,  greater than 90% of 3M’s manufacturing sites have ISO 
14001 certified (or  equivalent) management systems which are reviewed by an independent  3rd 
party as required by that standard.  
 
 
Key objectives  of the environmental auditing progr am include:  
• To measure and assure that procedures, practices and programs comply with 
environmental regulations  
• To identify potential environmental concerns and establish plans to address them  30 
 • To apprise management on compliance matters  
• To assure 3M environmental policy and standard expectations are met  
 
 
Following a re several key aspects  of 3M’s auditing program:  
• All manufacturing, distribution and laboratory operations are audited for environmental 
compliance on a frequency determined based on relative risk  
• At least annually, all global operations are assessed against a variety of criteria to 
establish a prioritized list of facilities for compliance auditing 
• 3M uses a variety of tools and resources for compliance auditing, including:  
o Internally -deve loped compliance protocols, created by subject matter experts in 
regulatory programs and 3M processes  
o 3M's Global Environment al Management Self -Assessment as an evaluation tool  
reference 
o Externally -purchased compliance protocols, especially for international operations, to 
ensure local compliance obligations are understood 
o Internal environmental compliance experts from around the company  
o External environmental consultants as needed to provide additional expertise and 
3rd party verification of our auditing protocols  
o Complete and robust documentation of audit findings, assignment of responsibility 
and due dates for closure of findings, and detailed review of findings closure to assure corrective actions are appropriate and sustainable.  
 
3M's environmental auditing program is audited periodically by 3M's Corporate Auditing department.  
 
 
Environmental Compliance Metrics:  
All 3M facilities globally are required to report environmental exceedences, spills, agency 
notices, and fines through 3M’s Worldwide Incident Management  System  (WIMS) .  These are 
defined as follows:  
 
• Exceedences :  Emissions or other environmental parameters above permitted or 
allowable regulatory levels  
• Reportable Spills : Spills required to be reported to a regulatory agency or government 
organization 
• Agency Notices : Notice s received by 3M for allegations  from an environmental 
regulatory or permitting requirement  
• Fines : Compensation paid by 3M to discharge an administrative fine or penalty imposed 
by an environmental regulatory agency.  
 
 
 
 31 
  
The chart s below  provide environmental compliance metrics for 2005 -2011 in each of these 
four areas.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Worldwide Incident Management system was implemented in 2010 as the new corporate-
wide database for reporting all EHS incidents.  Several different systems were utilized in the 
past.  The increase in global spills shown in the chart is due to the increased awareness of 
responsibilities, understanding of the WIMS system, and more consistent reporting 
requirements adhered t o in 2010 and 2011.  3M continues to advance uniform use of this 
corporate- wide incident reporting system across the company for all types of EHS incidents.  
 
Global environmental fines reported herein include more than the GRI definition of significant 
and reportable in 3M’s annual financial report  (10K) , as global fines regardless of significance 
are tracked and reported through 3M’s Worldwide Incident Management System.  The increase in 2010 was the result of fines incurred at one of our US manufacturing sites.

CLIMATE CHANGE  
 
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions have been a  priority for a long time at  3M.  
Although the science of global climate change is evolving, 3M has taken voluntary, responsible action to reduce and control GHG emissions . In addition to managing direct emissions from 3M 
operations, 3M has a decades -long track record of improving energy efficiency at our facilities 
and offers a wide range of innovative products to help our customers improve energy efficiency 
and reduce carbon footprints (see Energy Efficiency section below).   
 The Corporate Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Committee is responsible for all final 
decisions on climate change strategy and GHG emissions.  This includes setting Corporate 
GHG emission reduction goals and policies. For climate change strategy and G HG emission 
advice the Corporate EHS committee has appointed the cor porate Climate Change Steering 
Team. Complementing the efforts  of the Climate Change Steering Team, 3M’s business 
continuity planning process and crisis management p rogram review and manag e risks posed to 
the company’s physical operations and supply chains that may be affected, for example, by 
severe weather events and longer term trends.                 
 
Guiding Principles  
3M’s approach to global climate change is based on several principles:  
• 3M supports the long -term goal of sustainable development; the company is 
committed to continuous and measurable improvement in environmental 
performance as a means of achieving that goal.  
• Although the science of global climate change continues  to evolve; 3M believes that 
sufficient information exists to take voluntary, responsible action to reduce its 
greenhouse gas footprint.  
• 3M recognizes the activities of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and intends to participate i n the ongoing dialog over strategies to 
address potential global climate change issues.  
• 3M endorses a voluntary approach that involves all nations. If reductions are 
mandated by regulation or legislation, 3M endorses a uniform market -based 
approach that includes all nations; this approach should also include provisions for emissions trading, and credit for early action.  
• 3M supports continued research to assess the scientific and economic impacts of 
strategies to address climate change, while considering the interrelationship to other 
environmental regulations and issues.  
• 3M applies its environmental goals and standards, including those pertaining to 
greenhouse gas reductions, consistently around the world.  
 
Management Commitments  
To address the issue of cli mate change, 3M has committed to:  
• Develop and maintain an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.  
• Continue to improve energy efficiency on a production basis in manufacturing and 
administrative operations. This includes all aspects of direct and indirect us e of fossil 
fuels.  33 
 • Manage emission of greenhouse gases to optimize reductions and cost benefits.  
• Assess the potential use of renewable energy sources at 3M operations.  
• Increase the use of energy efficiency products within 3M operations and encourage 
their use by 3M suppliers and customers.  
• Incorporate an evaluation of environmental and energy impacts throughout the full product life cycle (from raw material acquisition through manufacturing, use, and 
disposal)  as part of the company’s Life Cycle Management assessment process.  
• Invest in research and development to create new products and technology that will 
reduce the generation and emissions of greenhouse gases.  
• Develop partnerships and participate in a positive dialog with governmental agencies 
and other o rganizations engaged in the climate change issue.  
 
 
History of Climate Change Reductions 
3M understands the impacts and reduction efforts associated with greenhouse emissions 
require long term commitment as the affects of both are not realized in one year alone.  
Therefore, implementing reduction initiatives have been a key 3M corporate priori ty. 3M’s 
greenhouse gas management strategy includes a rigorous greenhouse gas accounting system to generate an annual inventory of worldwide emissions. The process and associated GHG 
emissions reported from 1990- 2002 were validated by an external 3
rd party consultant .  Since 
2002, the global 3M inventory has been developed, maintained and 3rd party verified by 3M’s 
ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory in accordance to the World Resource Institute 
(WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBC SD) GHG Protocol. The data 
chart s below reflect  2002 -2011 results . 
 
The total GHG Inventory encompasses  the company’s diversity and complexity.  A total of 
approximately 600 facilities including R& D, manufacturing, distribution centers, and 
administrative support offices within 3M’ operational control are accounted for in the current inventory.  Both Scope 1(direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions as categorized by WRI are 
included. 3M tracks  and r eports both absolute and indexed to net sales emission data.  
With the publishing of the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard in October, 2011, 3M has been working on developing a 
Scope 3 emissions inventory.  While emissions could be estimated for most Scope 3 upstream 
categories, 3M places a high value on sound science and decision- making and has elected not 
to publicly report Scope 3 GHG emissions due to a high, unverifiable level of uncertainty in any 
emissions estimate.

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goals  
We are very proud of the reductions that we have made.  In the area of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, 3M has established and met two rounds of reduction goals.  The first set of goals 
was established in 2002, a US -based goal , that was set as part of our participation in the US 
EPA’s Climate Leaders program, to  reduce absolute U.S.  GHG emissions by 30% reduction 
from 2002  - 2007, and a  stretch global -goal to reduce our absolute 1990 GHGs by 50% by 
2005 .  We achieved our US base goal by reducing GHGs by 53 % during that time period.  We 
achieved our stretch 50% r eduction goal in 2006 when we reduced our 1990 GHGs by 62% (we 
just missed the global 50% reduction in 2005 by a few percentage points).   
Our next GHG goal was established in 2007.  It called for a 5% reduction, indexed to sales, by 
2011 from a 2006 base.   Final results for this goal were determined in May 2012.  We achieved 
a 55% indexed reduction  from 2006 through 2011.  Our reduction far exceeded our goal due to 
strong growth in global sales, effective emissions control technology, and strong employee 
energy efficiency efforts.  3M is currently working to establish its next GHG reduction goal(s). 
We hope to establish a new goal in 2012.  The following considerations are part of our current GHG goal setting effort:  
• How to best align our new goal with 3M’s  sustainability principles & strategy;  
• Relative materiality and impact by  3M on global GHG emissions throughout  its supply 
chain;  
• Possible new goal structures; and  
• 3M s ystem changes  that may be required.

  Produ ct Carbon Footprint Evaluations  
3M co nducts product carbon footprint evaluations  as part of  the product Life Cycle Assessment  
process on select products, and is engaged with key stakeholders to improve and refine 
common metrics for such analysis.  3M defines a product carbon footprint as greenhouse gas 
(CO2 equivalent) emissions resulting from a product across its  entire  life cyc le -- including raw 
material acquisition , manufacturing, transport, storage, use, and disposal of the product.   To 
calculate carbon footprints, 3M applies currently available standards and tools (e.g., 
WRI/WBCSD GHG Pro tocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard) .  One of 
the challenges in this area is the wide range of potential approaches and assumptions being 
utilized for such calculations.  To address these issues, 3M supports further development of 
common metrics and is working with the World Resource Institute and World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD), peer companies, governments, and environmental organizations. The goal of these efforts is to enable 3M and others to provide cost -effective, 
accurate and useful information to customers and other stakeholders.  
 
 
Managing Carbon Offsets  
Using product carbon footprint information, 3M has offset greenhouse gas emissions from 
certain products through the purchase of carbon offsets .  To consistently manage carbon 
offsets, 3M adopted a Product Carbon Footprint Offsets Standard (available at 
www.3M.com/sustainability  ).  This standard addresses the requirements for the calculation of 
product carbon footprints and the management of product carbon offsets. This standard also 
establishes criteria for the carbon footprint methodologies applied and acceptable qualified offsets, such as Voluntary Carbon Standard offsets (VCSs) from Certified Emi ssion Reductions 
(CERs) and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) from Verified Emission Reductions (VERs).  
 
Through December 2011, 3M businesses have acquired carbon offsets for product greenhouse 
gas emissions from seven different product lines across four bus iness market sectors.  For 
these effo rts, 3M Japan received the Encouraging Prize of the Carbon Offset Award from CO -
Net in Japan  in 2012.  
 
 
Regulatory Impacts  
Emission reporting obligations in the United States and emission control requirements under the 
European Union emission trading scheme  apply to 3M operations in these jurisdictions.   
Currently, two 3M facilities (France and Belgium) are required to hold emission allowances 
under the European Union emission trading scheme.   At both facilities, for all compliance 
periods to date, actual greenhouse gas emissions have remained below the emission credit allocations awarded by the applicable regulatory agencies.  In 2011, 3M facilities in the United 
States began reporting greenhouse gas emissions under t he USEPA Greenhouse Gas 
Reporting Rule.   
 
Physical Risks  
Severe weather and long term trends could affect 3M’s operations and supply chain.  To 
address these and other risks, 3M has developed and maintains a systematic Business 
Continuity and Planning Process and Crisis Management Program.  To implement this process 
and respond to specific incidents, 3M’s Corporate Crisis Management coordinates efforts of 37 
 local crisis management teams maintained at each 3M facility and international subsidiary.  
Corporate and local plans take into account natural disaster, infect ious disease, employee 
safety, protection of assets, customer service and other business continuity requirements that may impact specific facilities and businesses.  Every year, the local crisis management team 
must review and update their plan to reflect current conditions and performs a tabletop or actual 
crisis response exercise.  3M Corporate Auditing and Corporate Security monitor facility 
compliance with the Corporate Crisis Management Program.   
 
3M mitigates supply chain risks through a variety of m anagement practices, including multi -
sourcing raw materials, pre- qualification of potential outsource manufacturers, maintaining 
appropriate stocks of raw materials and contingency plans with key suppliers to ensure 
allocation to 3M in the event of supply disruption.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY  
At 3M, energy management  is global, comprehensive,  and extends beyond energy efficiency 
efforts in factories and buildings.  It is a team effort guided by the global Corporate Energy 
Policy.   Energy management responsibilities are coordinated by the Corporate Energy 
Management team  which was established i n 1973, with oversight by 3M’s corporate energy 
manager and senior engineering vice president, with active support from the CEO.  The team 
involves personnel from purchasing, environmental  operations , facility operations, finance, 
sourcing, engineering, energy management and corporate marketing and public affairs.  Each 
department provides cross functional contributions; ensuring energy efficient technology is 
being used, opportunities are being identified in the design process, renewable energy 
opportuniti es are identified and financed, and data is tracked routinely and consistently by 
facilities.  
 
Setting Energy Performance Goals  and Evaluating P rogress  
In 2010, as part of our 2015 Sustainability Goals,  3M set a global goal to  increase energy 
efficiency (resulting in decreased  greenhouse gas emissions) by 25% in 2015 from a 2005 base 
year (as measured by worldwide energy use indexed to net sales).  
 3M collects and analyzes energy -use data and energy efficiency project metrics t o: track 
progress toward corporate energy and greenhouse gas goals; identify opportunities for 
improvement, benchmark against past performance, and identify best practices that can be 
applied across global operations. All manufacturing locations and other locations greater than 
30,000 square feet  report energy use and energy cost s into an electronic reporting system 
monthly . Data is analyzed at the facility, division, business unit, and corporate levels quarterly 
for 3M’s six major business units (210 locat ions in 42 countries) as part of 3M’s EHS 
Management System Scorecard previously described.   
 
 
Total Energy Use (2000- 2011) : 
3M’s commitment to improving energy efficiency is evident in the figures and goals summary 
below. From 2000  through 2011, 3M has reduced energy usage by 59% indexed to Net Sales.

 Investing in Renewable Energy  
3M is investing and installing on- site renewable energy within our own operations  and 
continuing to expand and collaborate with external partnerships . Currently 0.82%  of 3M energy 
used is from renewable sources.  A few examples within the company include:  
 
• Pioltello, Italy (3M Italy Hea dquarters -New 2010):   This facility’s external building shell 
was designed for effective control of solar light through a system that allows light to enter 
and at the same time provides protection from UV rays to help reduce the demand for 
air-conditioning in hot summer month s.  Photovoltaic panels on the upper part of the 
building are expected to supply 100,000 kWh of energy to the building annually and 
heating and cooling are implemented through a geothermal system.  A number of the 
building’s features further support sustai nability, including a high -efficiency heat recovery 
system, high thermal performance glazing and an external shielding system.  
 
• Perth, Canada : In 2006, this Perth manufacturing facility installed a 2000 square foot 
solar wall on the south side of the warehouse.  The solar wall is used  to both preheat the 
air and reduce building transmission loss and provide approximately 500 MMBTU/year.  
 
• Austin, Texas :  Austin Energy Green  Choice Prog ram.  The 3M Austin Research 
Boulevard Site, part of the Communication Markets Division, is a founding member of 
the Austin Ener gy Green Choice Program.  From 2001 to  2010 the site purchased 
12,490,020 kWh of Green Choice power, which was  approximately 15% of the total 
power.  The amount of Green Choice power has increased at  the site and currently 
Green  Choice power  is approximately 30% of the site's total power.   
 
2011 Energy Highlights 
• Received the 2011 ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award (8th consecutive year)  
• Held monthly energy web conferences fashioned after ENERGY STAR conferences  
• Hosted 3M Global Energy Conference featuring nine outside speakers  
• Launched 3M Energy Management blog to engage more employees in energy topics  41 
 • Held energy awareness events/prog rams at plants and international subsidiaries

• Used social media to communicate energy -related news to a broader external audience  
 
 
Rewarding Energy Management Excellence  
An important component o f 3M’s strategic energy management plan is to recognize and share 
best energy management practices throughout the employees company. An energy cost 
reduction projects database enables a continuous flow of ideas and projects with identified 
associated cost savings.   This database currently tracks 3,675 projects worldwide. Of these 
projects 177 were completed in 2011.

AIR QUALITY  MANAGEMENT   
An important component to 3M ’s sustainability strategy is our commitment  to improving air 
quality globally .  Air emissions from 3M operations include volatile organics, particulates, and 
substances listed on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)  Toxic 
Release Inventory or global equivalent.   
 
With the increasing complexity of air quality regulations globally, reductions in actual air 
emissions and a solid air permit/regulatory approach are increasingly important components to 
global business growth and long term sustainability .  Air emission reductions are achieved 
through a variety of methods at 3M and include but are not limited to increasing the use of more sustainable raw materials, water based coatings and improving  process/equipment efficiency 
upgrading equipment , and implementing and maintaining pollution control technologies . All 
reduction efforts are integral to the company’s overall succ ess and assist the company with the 
challenge of improving air quality in the areas in which we operate.  
 
Implementing an d Maintaining Pollution Control  
Although 3M has made significant progress in reducing air emissions from our operations 
through  pollution prevention thinking (elimination at the source)  and improving process 
efficiencies (e.g. Lean Six Sigma), 3M implement s and maintains pollution control equipment 
when necessary. A  variety of pollution control technologies are evaluated and utilized to control 
and reduce our air emissions.  These include thermal oxidizers, baghouses, scrubbers, and 42 
 cyclones.  3M maintains rigorous preventative maintenance schedules to ensure proper 
operation and ongoing air pollution control effectiveness of volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ), 
particulate matter , and other air emissions .    
In the future, 3M is looking to expand the use of alternative control technologies to reduce 
energy and natural resource usage  of pollution control equipment , while still providing required 
air pollution control efficiencies.  Biological air pollution control systems are an innovative 
solution to control VOC emission s in certain 3M process es. In pilot a nd select scale d 
installations, 3M has demonstrated the technology can adequately reduce VOC emissions while significantly reducing operating costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and eliminating natural gas 
usag e.  
 
 
Integrating Green Chemistry Initiatives 
 
To integrate more sustainable raw materials, 3M uses  the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry 
(Anastas, P. T.; Warner, J. C. Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice, Oxford University Press: 
New York, 1998) , a holistic set of principles and framework for putting green chemistry into 
practice , as a tool for product development in select divisions . Green chemistry is the design, 
development, and implementation of chemical products and processes to reduce or eliminate 
the use and generation of substances hazardous to human health and the environmental. They 
must be more environmentally benign, more economical, and better performing and not just 
process optimization.    
 The principles can generally be grouped into four main categories: Hazard Reduction, Lower 
Impact Products & Processes, Resource Reduction & Conservation, and Use of Renewable 
Raw Materials.  
 In 2010, 3M’s Material Resource Division (MRD) , a major  internal supplier for many materials 
within 3M , created  a new product design tool which mandates the evaluation of new 
chemistries/products against the 12 principles in their division.  These principles are as follows : 
 
1. Prevent Waste Generation 
2. Atom Economy  
3. Less Hazardous Chemical 
Syntheses  
4. Designing  Safer Chemicals  
5. Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries  
6. Design for Energy Efficiency  
7. Use of Renewable Feed stocks 8. Use of most direct synthetic route  
9. Catalysis  
10. Design for Degradation 
11. Real-time analysis for Pollution 
Prevention 
12. Inherently safer chemistry for 
Accident Prevention  
 
The Material Resource Division engages  researchers and manufacturers at every stage of 
development to meet or exceed 3M's 2015 Sustainability Goals .  Green Chemistry is now a 
formal part of all scale- up efforts, most notably in an assessment of new programs as they 
move through research to full scale production.  These assessments are documented to enable 
rapid implementation and broad application of Green Chemistry advancements, regardless of 
their origin.  T hese efforts enable MR D to effectively introduce alternative sustainable options 
aligned with increasing  regulatory trends and to minimize costs as petroleum prices continue to 
rise, giving 3M a considerable advantage in raw materials pricing.    
 
 43 
  
 
Broadening Focus in 2011- 12 
In 2011, 3M established a green chemistry network to expand these activities outside of the MRD.  The network provides a forum for 3M employees to communicate green chemistry ideas

Setting V OC Go als and Evaluating Progress  
Air emiss ions from 3M operations ( e.g. volatile organics, particulates, and substances listed on 
the US EPA Toxic Release Inventory or global equivalent ) are tracked, reported, and 
aggregated through corporate environmental data  management systems.  Reductions in 
corporate- wide air emissions have been accomplished through the development of solvent -less 
and lower particulate technologies, green chemistry initiatives, pollution prevention programs, 
and pollution control equipment all mentioned above.   
 
3M has had VOC reduction goals since 1990 as shown below. Using 1990 as a base year, 3M 
has reduced VOC emissions 98% by year -end 2011 indexed to net sales.  Specific goal period

WASTE MANAGEMENT  
Waste management and minimization is an important component of 3M’s environmental 
stewardship. The 3M Corporate Reverse Supply Chain Services organization provides 
corporate oversight for global waste management activities.  3M’s Waste Management standard 
applies to all locations and provides the framework and corporate expectations that are required 
to manage all waste types from the t ime of generation until reused,  recycled, treated or 
disposed.  The standard sets a baseline for several core waste program elements and 
encourages waste minimization and recycling whenever possible.  
 
Recycling, Reuse,  Treatment and Disposal  
All waste recycling, reuse, treatment, and disposal practices are required to comply with 
applicable regulations and the 3M Disposal of Chemical Waste Policy , including waste stream 
profiles, content identification, and labeling .  Waste management practices and technologies are 
required to be approved through the 3M Corporate Reverse Supply Chain Services organization 
where the emphasis is on using only the most environmentally safe and appropriate waste 
management practices availabl e.  
 3M Corporate Reverse Supply Chain Services has a team of subject matter experts (Resource 
Recovery) dedicated to initiating and supporting internal projects to identify materials for  
recycling.  This team works with many levels within the organization (e.g. facilities , divisions, 
businesses and corporate wide)  on a variety of different waste recycling and reuses  initiatives .  
The variation of projects and programs range from basic office recycling to more complex such 
as developing and capturing intrinsic waste materials generated off a manufacturing line.  
Through an evaluation process  all aspects of diversion benefits or risk  are reviewed.  Some 
programs have initiated and implemented excellent reuse programs, which are then shared as a 
best practice throughout the organization for replication.  3M continues to work  with our 
customers and manufacturing partners to manage or develop recycling programs to continue to 
support our community commitment of sustainability.  
 
Ensuring Waste Compliance  
The 3M Waste Management Standard requires each location to assign a Waste Management 
Coordinator who is responsible for ensuring personnel receive applicable waste training.   
Corporate Reverse Supply Chain services administers the waste training for  the coordinator s in 
the US and is currently enhancing  and expanding waste training internationally. Compliance 
with all 3M and other regulated waste requirements is evaluated through the environmental 
auditing program.  
 
    
 
     46 
  
 Setting Waste Goals and Evaluating Progress 
3M has been setting total waste reduction goals since 1990.  Using 1990 as a base year, 3M 
has reduced our total waste by 68%  (indexed to net sales)  through 2011.  Specific goal period 
achievements are highlighted below.

2011 Waste Challenges and Highlights  
 As 3M continues to grow internationally, integrating consistent waste management 
practices in accordance to 3M’s standard and expectations remains a key objective.  
 Accurate waste identification and separation to reuse, recycle, treat, or dispose of 
various  waste types is a continuous education process and provides  an opportunity to 
further advance waste minimization and recycling at all locations.  
 In 2011, 3M enhanced the Global Environmental Management Self Assessment 
(GEMSA) tool with core waste managemen t elements and requirements for all 3M 
facilities to evaluate their performance.  This will enable facilities to enhance their waste 
management practices and identify opportunities.  
 
 
Reducing Waste for our Customers  
3M is continually looking for opportuni ties to assist customers with managing/reducing waste.  
For example, s everal packaging reduction and process/product redesign projects have been 
and continue to be implemented to reduce our impacts.  3M will continue to integrate feedback 
and initiate proj ects to assist customers with minimizing waste impacts.

WATER MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION  
 
Understanding our  Water Footprint  
Reducing w ater use and improving water quality are additional important elements of 
environmental stewardship.  T herefore , 3M continues to actively understand,  manage,  and work 
toward reducing our corporate water footprint.  3M’s Water Management Standard provides a 
global framework including both general and specific elements for water management within the 
company. The standard requires 3M operations to manage their w ater resources through 
understanding their water use, compliance with regulatory require ments, systematic 
conservation and reuse, and reporting of water usage .  Water resources include water intake, 
effluent water discharge, and rainwater.  
 
Setting Water P erformance Goals and Evaluating P rogress  
3M’s Corporate Operating C ommittee endorsed a water conservation goal as part of the 2015 
Sustainability G oals.  The goal is focused on water conservation planning and reductions efforts 
in regions of the world wher e water resources are limited or excessively extracted (water 
stressed and hyper -stressed) . 3M uses the definitions and tools established by the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to compare the company's various 
site locations and their affiliated water use with validated WBCSD water  availability , population,  
and biodiversity information on a country and watershed basis.   Currently 3M has identified 18 
sites (out of over 200 sites) loca ted in water stressed or hyper stressed areas  as defined by the 
Mean Annual Relative Water Stress Index (WBCSD -Global Water Tool) . Each 3M site located in 
a water stressed or hyper stressed area is required  to understand their water use in detail, 
associated business risks/impacts, and local water requirements .  Each identified site is also 
required to develop a water conservation plan outlining current and future water conservation efforts.  Annual evaluations are conducted using any updates from the WBCSD Global Water 
Tool, an analysis of site operat ions and water usage, and local conditions to determine 3M sites 
water stress level.  
 
All 3M manufacturing sit es currently  track and report water usage. A lthough 3M does not have a 
quantitative goal , conservation efforts indicate a 48% decrease in water us e globally  indexed to 
net sales from 2005 to 2011.  Water c onservation efforts have been achieved through 
recycling/reuse and improvements to our buildings and manufacturing processes. A majority of our water int ense manufacturing operations are located in the United States and Europe in 
areas not water stressed or water scarce.  H owever , they also contribute significantly to our 
conservation efforts .  Although the company continues to grow  in many regions of the world 
thoughtful consideration is placed on the type of operations and availability of resources such as 
water.  
 49 
  
Improving Water Quality and Water management for our Customer s 
Similar to other management aspects of environmental stewardship, 3M provides solutions for 
water conservation and water  quality . Some examples include water pipe solutions  that remedy

 ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY  
Enhancing and preserving biodiversity is an important part of 3M’s value of respecting our social 
and physical environment. 3M has been working to preserve biodiversity both on our property 
and through our support of organizations like The Nature Conservancy.  
 
Biodiversity at 3M  
The locations of some of 3M’s facilities share the same land with rare species of wildlife. In 
these locations and on other 3M properties that support wildlife, the company works to enhance 
and protect the area’s natural habitat.  
 When developing property, the planning process begins with a thorough evaluation of local soils 
and geol ogic conditions, ground water and hydrology characteristics, drainage, flora and  fauna 
and items of archeological or historical significance.   The resulting design seeks to comply with 
all known local, state or federal regulations and to avoid or minimize negative impacts on 
cultural or natural resources.   If an impact is unavoidable, we seek to mitigate the impact by 
preserving a property with property of equal or greater q uality.  
 
3M has a very large, existing property portfolio, much of which was designed and built nearly 40 
years ago .  As our business and customer needs change, we have focused on maximizing the 
efficient use of existing space and to the extent possible r enovating to meet our current and 
future business needs.  This allows the company to grow while minimizing our impacts on biodiversity and our natural resources.  
 
For example, one of 3M’s  facilities in Austin, Texas is located within critical habitat for t he 
endangered golden- cheeked warbler. The 3M Austin facility has worked hard to not only limit 
the impact of its operations on the warbler, but to enhance the facility’s property to create a 
habitat that can be used by the warbler as well as a number of ot her species found near the 
facility.  
 
The 3M Austin site worked with The Wildlife Habitat Council  (WHC) , a nonprofit organization 
that helps corporations, conservation organizations and individuals interested in protecting and enhancing wildlife habitat. W HC makes recommendations in the form of a detailed wildlife plan 
for the property that will allow wildlife to prosper. After programs are put in place, the WHC  
operates a Corporate Habitat Certification/International Accreditation Program. This program 
recognizes exceptional habitat management and environmental education programs at 
corporate sites.   Sites are required to re- certify each year.  
 
In addition the 3M Austin site, c urrently, t hree other 3M facilities maintain Wildlife Habitat 
Certification : Menomonie, Wisconsi n, Cottage Grove, Minnesota and 3M Center-St. Paul, 
Minnesota. 
 
 
   
 
   51 
 
Biodiversity through Partnerships  
The Nature  Conservancy ( TNC):   
 
Through the 3M Foundation,  3M has worked 
with the Nature Conservancy to preserve habitat around the world.  This partnership is 
helping to safeguard critical habitat and 
preserve biodiversity.  The partnership with 
TNC involves 3M employees and local 
residents.   In addition to  increasing the 
amount of protected lands for migration 
zones, endangered wildlife and rare 
indigenous plants, 3M is working with the 
Nature Conservancy to improve visitor 
access and learning opportunities for the 
public.  
 
 
 
Each year, 3M works with the Nature Conservancy on a variety of projects worldwide:  
 
North America Region  
• Canada’s Dark wood’s  in British Columbia  
3M supported the preservation of land in Dark woods .  Dark wood’s  255,000 acres of 
contiguous protected area links existing wildlife management areas with parks where 
threatened plant and animal species may thrive.  Through the Nature Conservancy’s 
efforts, h abitat is being restored for caribou, grizzly bears, and owls  while protecting 
water quality and forest lands.   
• United States -Montana Forest Legacy and North Fork of the Flathead  
Sustaining the Crown of the Continent and connecting the vast network of wild lands in the Northern Rockies presents one of the best opportunities on the globe for ecosystem 
protection and resiliency.  In 2011, 3M provi ded a $1 million grant for the Crown of the 
Continent project
 representing two of the largest conservation acquisitions in North 
American history and knitting  together a 60 -million -acre network of protected public 
lands across Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and into southern British Columbia.   
 
Asia Pacific and Northern China Regions  
• The Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve  
The nature reserve is near the mouth of the Yangtze 
River near Shanghai. It is an important corridor 
unique biodiversity for migratory birds from Japan to 
Australia and a critical fish spawning area. With 3M support  through funding and over 80 volunteers , 
TNC is helping to develop conservation management plans, including ecotourism to help 
ensure that environmental safeguards are in place to pr otect the area. The State 
Forestry Administration of China has asked TNC to help direct their efforts to create a system of 51 model Nature Reserves in China by 2020. These reserves will serve as 
demonstration sites for the government to promote effective conservation management 
and the integration of community and economic development with conservation efforts.  “Over the past decade and beyond, 3M has 
been a critical partner in our organization’s 
evolution, helping to advance our work in 
places across the world –  from the 
indigenous lands of Australia’s outback, Mexico’s Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, and 
the Maya F orest; to Brazil, where we train 
Amazon indigenous leaders to conserve their 
vast territories; to China’s wetland reserves; 
to British Columbia’s Darkwoods and 
Alabama’s Paint Rock River watershed; and 
numerous points in between. . . We could not 
have achi eved our goals and successes 
without the collaboration of 3M and the 3M 
Foundation.”  Mark Tercek, Presiden t and 
CEO, The Nature Conservancy  52 
  
• Australia’s Fish River Station 
3M's support assisted with the purchase of northern Australia’s Fish River Station 
property in 2009, protecting more than 450,000 acres and hundreds of species such as 
wallabies and bandicoots.  TNC’s work is helping return the property to indigenous 
traditional owners and develop long -term sustainable management plans for the 
property.  
 
Latin America Region  
• Brazil -Atlantic Forest Water Producer Program  
In Brazil, a 3M grant is helping TNC preserve the concentration of unique and threatened plants and animals that can only be found in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest. Less 
than 8 percent of the original tropical forest remains today. The purchase of nearly 2,400 
acres will manage and protect it from further clearing and environmental threats.  
 
The Atlantic Forest pr ovides drinking water to 70% of Brazil’s 120 million people. TNC is 
working on a large- scale reforestation and protection program in the Atlantic Forest 
where one of its most important project sites provides water to nearly 9 million people in 
Sao Paolo. 3M’s plant in Campinas has been supporting national - and municipal -level 
reforestation projects in the area since 2004.   
 
• Mexico -Calakmul Biosphere Reserve and Maya Forest  
The forests of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula are of extraordinary ecological importance . 
More than 1.5 million acres of forest have been set aside –  with assistance from 3M and 
other donors in protected areas such as the Calakmul Biosphere reserve. Still, important 
forest lands are lost or threatened by illegal logging, conversion to agricul ture, 
settlement, and unsustainable tourism.  
 
TNC’s goal for the region is to protect the forest while developing livelihoods for local 
people through sustainable forestry and tourism activities.  
 Project strategies:  
o Protect an additional 250,000 acres of forest by acquiring land, decreeing 
protected areas, and working with private and community landowners  
o Develop sustainable forestry practices on 100,000 acres of private and 
community -owned forest lands  
o Promote and develop community -based, sustainable tour ism 
o Reforest up to 10,000 acres of forest lands damaged by Hurricane Dean  
Effectively manage forest protected areas by implementing wildfire controls, 
reducing illegal logging and deterring Poachers

 PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY  
Our commitment to p roduct responsibility includes product regulatory compliance, life cycle 
management, and accurately representing our products through communications and 
marketing.  
 
Life Cycle Management  
3M’s global Life Cycle Management (LCM) process is used to identify opportunities associated 
with environmental, health, and safety (EHS) performance, and to characterize and manage 
EHS risks  and regulatory compliance throughout a product’s life cycle ( raw material acquisition, 
development, manufacture, use, and disposal). LCM is qualitative in evaluation and applies 
globally to all 3M products and internal transfers regardless of their source. All 3M products -  
whether 3M -developed, developed jointly with another company, or ac quired from a third party 
may be subject to rev iew. Any product purchased from an outside supplier for sale as a 3M 
product receives the same product life cycle consideration as an internally developed and 
manufactured product. LCM evaluations are a required component of a 3M’s New Product 
Introduction (NPI) process.    
 
All of the elements listed below may be incorporated and implemented through various tools 
and resources in 3M’s overall LCM evaluation process.  
• Environmental Impacts of Product use  
• Environmental Impact of Product Manufacturing 
• Environmental Impact of Raw Materials/Procured Components  
• Climate Change Impacts  
• Reduction of Hazardous Materials  
• Reduction of Health Effects  
• Design for recycling of remaining materials  
 
A more detailed, quantitative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)  is complet ed on selected products 
and analyses the environmental impacts of material acquisition, manufacturing, and distribution.  
Individual LCAs may be conducted on specific life cycle stages to evaluate risk in more detail 
during the new product introduction process as needed.  3M has a consistent global strategy for 
conducting LCAs, lead by the Corporate Environm ental Laboratory, which has adopted the ISO 
14040 series standards, World Resource Institute, and World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development standards as guidance.  
 
 
Environmental Product Declarations  
Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs)  standardized reports to communicate Life Cycle 
Assessment (LCA) results. Product Category Rules (PRCs) are developed to standardize application of a Carbon Product Footprint or LCA standard to a specific product category. 3M 
uses EPDs as one tool to communicate aspects of our products that are environmentally 
beneficial to the user/consumer.    3M has adopted the ISO 14040 series standards, World 
Resource Institute , World Business Council for Sustainable Development standards and the 
ReCiPe methodology  for creating Environmental Product Declarations.  In addition, other 
standards as well as published category rules may apply and are utilized upon request . 
 
Environmental Product Declarations are generat ed using Product Category Rules  (PCRs) .  3M 
uses published Product Category Rules that have been established and are credible where appropriate for the use in making Environmental Product Declarations. 3M is working with the 
Sustainability Consortium to assist in establishing Product Category Rules.  Internal guidance is 54 
 provided to 3M businesses g lobally to ensure the EPDs meet  the company's requirements and 
are substantiated in accordance to the standards and methodologies specified.  
 
Product Marketing and Communications  
It is 3M policy  (3M’s Advertising and Product Representation Policy ) to rep resent our products 
truthfully, fairly and accurately  in all sales, advertising, packaging and promotional efforts. 
Management of every 3M business unit is res ponsible for ensuring  appropriate review  of 
advertising and claims regarding respective business products and services.  
 
All Environmental Product claims must be substantiated and technically accurate to the end 
user as specified by the Advertising and Product Representation Policy . 3M’s environmental 
claims support t eam assists businesses in determining the appropriate product claims and is 
comprised of laboratory scientists, legal staff, life cycle management professionals, and other 
environmental marketing and business expertise.  Extensive environmental marketing claim 
information and guidance is provided in 3M’s internal Environmental Claims Guide.  
 
 
Providing Sustainable Products 
3M’s commitment to sustainabil ity and environmental stewardship goes beyond minimizing our 
impacts to the environment from our operations. Through innovation and as noted  through 
examples highlighted above, 3M provides product solutions that help our customers minimize 
their own environmental impacts and make people's lives easier and better. Our inspiration 
comes from listening to customers and creating new products and s olutions for the challenges 
and opportunities they face. As mentioned, 3M has developed env ironmental solution catalogs 
that feature these products (see link in further information  below ).  Products included in the 
catalogs must meet one or more of the cri teria below:  
 
Products that help 3M customers to reduce their environmental footprint  
• Products that reduce air pollution  
• Products that reduce customer energy use &/or greenhouse gas emissions    
• Products that reduce customer waste (e.g. reuse,  recycling, and composting )  
• Products that reduce customer water use or pollution   
• Products that prevent the disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas or clean up 
industrial pollution 
• Impro ve fuel economy in vehicles (e.g. light weighting)  
 
Products that are manufactured with a reduced footprint   
• Products manufactured using a low/no solvent (VOC) process    
• Products that are made with recycled content, renewable resources, or using 3rd party 
certified materials  
• Products that do not contain materials of concern typically found in competitive products  
Products with less of a carbon footprint than other similar solutions using the same 
methodology

and is currently focusing on the following areas to minimize our packaging impact . 
 
• Rigid Plastic Packaging -Working to increase post-consumer recycled content  
• Polyvinyl Chloride ( PVC)-Working to eliminate PVC in packaging where technically and 
economically feasible  
• Heavy Metals -Maintain management processes in place to address heavy metals  in 
packaging.  
 
 
 Setting Goals and Evaluat ing Performance  
The US Packaging sustainability optimization improvements made by 3M packa ging engineers 
are entered into  a 3M developed, packaging sustainability reporting tool by the packaging 
engineers making the improvements.  The weight s avings data and sales volume are compiled 
each month to calculate actual pounds removed from waste streams. Improvement data on all 
items is tracked for 12 months.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
         
57 
 Reducing Packaging Footprint for our Customers 
A variety of projects have been implemented within the company  worldwide and across many 
businesses  to reduce our packaging footprint.  B elow are a few examples of reduced or more  
sustainable packaging materials .  Several other projects have been implemented to optimize 
shipping layouts .

POLLUTION PREVENTION PAYS (3P) 
3M’s Pollution Prevention Pays program celebrated its 36th anniversary in 2011.  Over that last 
36 years, the program has prevented more than 1.75 Million short -tons of pollutants and saved 
nearly $1.5 billion (USD) based on aggregated data from the first year of each 3P project.   The 
3P program helps prevent pol lution at the source, in products and manufacturing processes 
rather than removing it after is has been created.  When 3P was launched in 1975, the concept 
of applying pollution prevention on a companywide basis and documenting the results was an 
industry first. 
 
The 3P program invites participation from all aspects of the company including research and 
development, manufacturing, logistics, transportation, and packaging employees with various 
award categories and criteria.  
 
3P is a key element of our envir onmental strategy and is advancing our sustainability efforts.  
3P has achieved that status based on our belief that a prevention approach is more 
environmentally effective, socially acceptable, and more economical than conventional pollution 
controls.  Natural resources, energy and financial commitment are used to build conventional 
controls and are increase during operation.  3P seeks to eliminate pollution through the 
following methods:  
 
• Product reformulation  
• Process Modif ication/Redesign  
• Equipment Redes ign 
• Supply Chain Improvements  
• Recycling and Reuse of waste materials  
 
58 
 The program depends directly on the voluntary participation of 3M employees.  Innovative 
projects selected by a 3P committee representing R&D, engineering, EHS, manufacturing, and 
supply  chain organizations are recognized for their achievements with 3P awards  
 
3P Global  Results  (1975- 2011)  
Total Number of Projects: 9300  
Total Savings: 1.5 Billion USD 
Total Pollution Prevented:  1.75 Million Short Tons  
 
 
 
 SOCIAL  RESPONSBILITY  
3M is committed to continuously improving the quality of life of our workforce, their families, as

culture that affords all employees the opportunity to work without fear of intimidation, reprisal or harassment, in an environment where employees are able to get their questions addressed in a fair and timely manner. In all locations, the company’s 
relationship with employees, whether union or non- union, is a key responsibility of all 
leaders, assisted by human resources representatives. Human resources professionals work with all employees to maintain positive employee relations. 3M recognizes and 
respects the right of employees to join unions and engage in collective bargaining as 
permitted by applicable laws in the countries where 3M does business.

Compliance and Business Conduct independent third party vendor, Ethics Point.  Additionally, 
employees have several additional  ways to report issues, such as talking to a manager, 
supervisor, or any Human Resources professional.  Whichever way concerns are reported, 3M will assign an individual to investigate of the issues raised, and report back to the party 
expressing the concern. 3M prohibits retaliation against anyone reporting a business conduct

Our culture has always emphasized integrity and fairness alongside innovation and excellence,

 Leveraging Diversity 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is evidenced in our ongoing support of national 
diverse organizations, our support of education especially in science and technology and the 
external recognition we have received for our inclusive policies and practices.  
 Our employee resource groups are an integral part of 3M’s business growth. They provide

business challenges . What results  from the par tnership between the groups is  
impressive. Many of our employee resource groups are  able to identify market potential 
for specific customer segments which were in the millions.   
 
• Our employee resource group, People Like Us was instrumental in driving changes to 
our policies and benefits offerings. As a result, we were recognized as a Best Place to 
Work for LGBT Equality with a rating of 100% again.  Last year , the Human Rights 
Commission put more stringent requirements  into the survey and out of 315 companies;  
only 190 companies  achieved 100% .  
 
• Our businesses are leveraging employee resource groups to help accelerate growth in 
emerging markets. For example, the Industrial and Transportation Business partnered 
with the Latino Resource Group to understand how to engage and sell to diverse 
customers using a multicultural business development process.

Plan (GESPP) ‚  3M offers employees a 15 percent discount on 3M stock purchases. 3M 
hopes the GESPP will help employees achieve their long- term financial goals. Over the 
years‚ employees have used their GESPP investments for everything from home 
improvement projects to f unding their children’s and grandchildren’s educations. 3M has 
encouraged employees to become owners of the company through the GESPP since 1964‚ 
when the company introduced the plan. Today‚ more than 40 countries have adopted the 65 
 plan‚ more than 63‚000 em ployees worldwide are eligible and more than 16‚000 employees 
currently participate in the plan.

care, including child care and elder care. In 2007, 3M began offering Chil d Care and Adult 
Care Consultation and Referral services through the 3M Employee Assistance Program in 
order to help employees locate appropriate services for their loved ones across the U.S.  
 
o Employee Assistance Program :  In 1974, 3M began an employee as sistance program which 
today provides over 7,200 hours of consultation and education per year to U.S. employees and their dependents, and leaders across 3M to assist them in navigating challenging situations. In some locations outside of the United States,  3M offers employee assistance 
resources at the local level. Resources enhance well -being and effectiveness; prevent 
problems; or address a wide range of personal, family, work or behavioral health 
challenges, are available online, in print literature and other media. This includes topics 
such as: resiliency, stress management, shift work , anxiety and depression, alcohol and 
drugs, personal financial and legal problems, and how to support employees or family members in grief or troubling situations.

special discounts and priv ileges in support of exercise, friendships and fun. The largest 
employee club is in St. Paul, Minn., and has approximately 7,700 members.  
 
o Flexible Work Arrangements : 3M recognizes the importance of helping employees balance 
their life concerns with their  work responsibilities. 3M employees are able to explore with 
their management a variety of flexible work arrangements, including part -time, job share, 
flex-time, compressed work week and telecommuting. These opportunities are 
communicated to employees thr ough management and are administered through 3M 
internal systems.  
 
o Health Living:  One way we promote an enjoyable work culture is by providing a work 
environment where healthy living is easy and where wellness is promoted. 3M employees 
enjoy multiple Heal thy Living offerings. One example is 3M’s monthly Healthy Living 
Newsletter. All U.S. employees with e -mail get this monthly e- newsletter highlighting events 
and employee stories. 3M employees who do not work at computers have access to a paper 
copy of the same content. Across the U.S., 3M employees made 7,700 unique visits to the 
online newsletter in October, November and December alone. Our research finds that 3Mers enjoy reading personal stories about how others in the company have been 
successful at gai ning renewed health. That’s no surprise to us! Sharing healthy living stories 
is just one more way 3Mers collaborate and challenge each other to do more and be better 
for our customers and ourselves.   Another example is our recent Shape Up Challenge. In 
2011, the Shape Up Challenge was open to all U.S. employees and more than 10,000 3M employees registered to participate.   66 
  
 
Education, Learning and Career Growth  
Today’s business environment demands that we become faster and more flexible in anticipating 
and exceeding the needs of our customers, shareholders and employees. Creating a high 
performance culture built on continuous learning will help 3M achieve business growth for the 
company and professional growth for employees. From 2006 to 2011, 3M invested $3.4 million 
in education and learning programs.  
 
o Skill Mapping and Contribution and Development Assessment :  Each year, every 3M non-
production employee identifies their contributions in meeting their specified goals and 
creates an individual development plan that includes the next year’s set of goals to elevate individual performance and skills.  Additional skill mapping tools may be used in 
collaboration with the employee’s supervisor to identify long- term desired goals. 
Contribution and development ass essments for production staff follow site specific 
procedures depending on local  requirements and  business specific needs . 
 
o Accelerated Leadership Development :  3M views leadership development as a competitive 
advantage and is accelerating leadership devel opment in a variety of ways:  
• Our senior management team is strengthening our leadership talent by selectively 
recruiting proven leaders from outside the company for key functional and business 
roles to lead our businesses in new directions.  
• 3M's senior m anagement team has identified six key leadership attributes. All 
employees are expected to think from the outside in; drive innovation and growth; 
develop, teach and engage others; make courageous decisions; lead with energy, 
passion and urgency; and live 3M values. These attributes have been incorporated into 
our performance assessment and development process for most of 3M’s salaried 
workforce and all of its supervisory, management and executive employees so that we 
can regularly assess the extent to whic h employees' behavior demonstrate these 
attributes to help them develop their leadership behaviors.  
• 3M is identifying leaders and giving all employees the tools to develop leadership throughout their careers. We are also investing in the development of leaders through 
the Leadership Development Programs, which include training programs for all 
employees, supervisors and managers. We offer several intense accelerated learning 
development experiences for supervisors, managers and directors. Participants 
experience real -life learning by working on 3M business issues and presenting 
recommendations to senior management.  
• Employees have access to an intranet site dedicated to their career and personal 
development. The site provides a strategic career planning process, information to guide 
employees as they set goals and document contributions, access to on -demand learning 
modules and suites of courses, mentoring guidelines and tips for aligning career goals to 3M business goals for greater success at 3M.  
• While 3M  leaders have always been known for sharing best practices, especially 
technological breakthroughs, today's leaders at 3M have a passion for learning and 
sharing ideas. There's an increased emphasis on action learning and "leaders teaching 
leaders" includi ng teaching, coaching and mentoring by leaders at the highest levels of 
the organization.  
• Learning has also taken a new place within the value chain for 3M businesses. Leaders 
are leveraging new learning technologies and blended learning solutions to impr ove 
employee access to learning content and performance support tools. They are also 67 
 focused on decreasing the cost of traditional learning events and increasing customer 
and channel partner loyalty. Learning has become a more valuable and measurable 
business strategy.  
 
o Tuition Refund:  In 3M locations around the world, employees are encouraged to 
continuously learn and improve their skills. In most countries where we do business, 3M offers, with management support, tuition reimbursement to encourage employ ees to 
upgrade their education to better meet current job responsibilities, prepare for future 
responsibilities and help qualify for changes in career paths within 3M.  
 
o Mentoring:  3M encourages mentoring partnerships and provides training, tools, networks  
and consulting to support strategy and program development across the company. Some 
organizations have assisted mentoring programs to help identify and recruit mentors to meet 
the needs of specific individuals. An online Mentoring Program Design Kit with guidelines for 
developing and implementing a mentoring program in alignment with strategic business objectives is available to support organizations wanting to offer mentoring programs.  
 
The Mentoring Special Interest Group (SIG), a volunteer organization sponsored by the Vice 
President of Community Affairs, matches individuals interested in being matched with a 
mentoring partner. The SIG provides a quarterly luncheon/kick -off session to launch new 
mentoring partners. Since 2001, the SIG has matched more t han 750 mentoring 
partnerships.  
 
Self-directed mentoring guidelines provide a step -by-step process that individuals can use to 
identify and recruit a mentor and then to effectively manage a mentoring partnership.  
 
An executive diversity mentoring program supports the professional development of high 
performing minority and women employees. Since January 2002, more than 730 females and minorities have enrolled in this program.  
 
o Outplacement Assistance : 3M offers a range of outplacement services and resources for 
employees whose positions are eliminated due to business needs. These resources are 
offered on a worldwide basis to help employees transition to employment in other areas of 
3M or outside of the company and include services such as development of car eer transition 
skills and identification of job placement opportunities. In addition, 3M has an internal 
recruiting website that lists current 3M position openings for employees to self -nominate as 
well as career development information and tools.  
 
Additional Resources and Opportunities Offered Globally  
 Adoption Assistance  
 Scholarships for eligible dependents of employees  
 Employee stores for purchase of 3M products online or at many 3M locations  
 Support for community involvement: Matching Gifts, Volunteer Match, and 3M 
Community Giving

 Communi cation and Technology Networks  
3M has numerous pathways to support organizational communications, learning and knowledge 
management. There are a variety of corporate and job functional systems to methodi cally help 
information and knowledge emerge and flow to the right people at the right time to add value. Examples are detailed below:  
  
o Formal Learning Networks:  The Global Learning Network (GLN) is 3M’s corporate learning 
management system and is a one -stop electronic learning center that helps employees 
enroll in, deliver, track and report on learning activities. GLN serves the learning needs of 3M business unit s, plants and learning organizations globally.  
 o Intranet Knowledge Platforms Databases :  3M's intranet site structure is set up so that each 
employee has a "Work Center" as one of the quick link tabs following login. Each work center is a collection of tools, systems and processes that are used routinely in daily work 
practices to successfully complete projects/work assignments in an employee’s functional 
work area. A link to other work centers is also available.  
 
o Best Practice Descriptions/Processes :  As a  diverse technical company, 3M shares best 
practices several ways. Two of the most widely used internal organizations are the 3M Tech 
Forum and the 3M Engineering Technology Organization (ETO). These two organizations 
provide an extensive network of expert ise through specialized chapters focused on 3M's 
core technologies and other emerging markets. Employees in R&D, manufacturing and 
other parts of the supply chain are able to collaborate and drive innovation globally across 
the organization 
 
o Company Educat ion Facility : In addition to a variety of general courses, webinars, etc., 3M 
offers specialized extended courses to increase skills such as the 3M Leadership 
Development Institute, the 3M Marketing University and the General Managers’ and 
Managing Directors’ (GM&MD) program.  
 
o Idea Management :  Idea management is driven differently across the company depending 
on organizational needs and what works best for the area of work. Some platform examples 
include Innovation Live, Wiki Enterprise, and 3M internal and external social media 
channels. All systems are implemented and available globally to share best practices and 
ideas.  
 
M
EASURING  AND RECOGNIZING EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT    
As 3M corporate policy, a standard opinion survey is administered to all employees at locations worldwide once every two years. The information received is used to address employee 
concerns and identify opportunities for improvement. In addition, custom or  “mini” surveys can 
be used by business units to gather additional information either as a follow up to the standard opinion survey or to go more in- depth on a particular topic. A variety of other 360 feedback tools  
are also available upon demand.  
 
Employe e Rewards and Recognition  
Hard work and extra effort are rewarded and recognized at 3M through an array of award 
programs. 3M sponsors many corporate award programs to honor individuals and teams that 
make significant contributions to the company. In addit ion, many divisions, departmental areas 
of business and staff units also have their own specific ways of recognizing and rewarding 69 
 people. Across 3M, management can choose from a variety of monetary and non- monetary

 GLOBAL SAFETY AND HEALTH  
3M has a long history of ensuring global Safety  and Health commitmen t to all employees. 3M’s 
Safety and Health Policy applies to all 3M operations, including new acquisitions.  It is based on 
our core business v alues and stems from our Environmental, Health, and Safety vision for “Safe 
and Healthy People, Products and Planet.” The policy confirms 3M’s commitment to protecting 
the safety  and health of those working at or visiting a 3M location.  
Corporate Safety  and Industrial Hygiene operations executes the vision, strategies and policy by 
partnering  with each of the six business units worldwide to develop and implement practical 
preventive and risk based solutions;  driving  safety  health excellence throughout the company.  
All visitors, vendors, and contract workers at 3M locations are held to the same safety and health requirements as 3M employees, therefore consistent management systems and 
evaluation tools are critical to company safety  and health success.  
 
Safety and Health Management System & Performance  
 In 1996, a Global Safety & Health Plan (GSHP) 
tool was initiated for all 3M locations worldwide and 
is a well developed self assessment categorized 
into multiple elements addressing various areas and standards related of safety and health. The 
GSHP tool is a n integral part of 3M’s global safety 
and health management systems, which allow 
locations and the corporation as a whole to assess 
the current status versus various safety and health systems requirements. Using a standardized 
assessment approach allows for meaningful 
performance results to be shared throughout the 
company.  Through implementation of this tool, 
each 3M location develops applicable safety and 
health management system s, identifies gaps in 
their safety and health programs/performance, and 
develops plans to close gaps and drive continuous 
improvement in their own safety and performance.  
 
The GSHP standards embedded in the assessment tool are categorized under the followi ng 
elements:  
 
Management System Elements  
Local Safety and Health Plans, Safety and 
Health Committees, Performance Appraisals, Staffing and Qualifications, Self Evaluations,

Setting Goals and Measuri ng Safety and Health Performance
Measuring leading indicators of Safety and Health performance is a key focus for 3M. Aggregated data from all Global Safety and Health Plan Assessments, Audits, and Incident 
reporting are evaluated to identify performance status and corporate wide opportunities.  Metrics 
are tracked and reported for continuous improvement at the facility, business unit, regional, and 
corporate levels.  Initiatives such as improving quality and level of implementation of safely  and 
health management system elements ( includin g preventive measures) at each 3M site results in 
increased awareness, mature programs, and reduced injury and illness rates.  Based on the 
most recent evaluations, 3M has set the following key safety and health objectives for  corporate 
wide continuous imp rovement in 2012.

3M has been monitoring, measuring, and working toward improving leading indicators of 
performance while simultaneously increasing the growth of the company.  As a result of our 
efforts, lagging indicators such as worldwide recordable and lost time rates  have decreased 
overall between 2006 and 2011. 3M follows the US OSHA recordkeeping rules and formulas to 
record and measure injury / illness rates worldwide.

 There were zero employee and contingent worker fatalities on the job in 3M during 2011.  
However, we were struck by the loss of a contractor performing routine construction work. This 
person fell approximately 1 meter from a small portable A-Frame style ladder  that was 1.5 
meters in height.  The fall resulted in a fatal head injury.  This tragic accident clearly demonstrates that even low risk tasks can result in severe consequences when control 
mechanisms and layers of protection fail to work as intended.  The 2012 objective to improve 
risk management across 3M is a part of the measures being taken to help prevent serious 
injuries and fatalities in the future.

PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS  
3M has followed the advice of the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and other governmental agencies, and has developed a preparedness plan for a possible global 
pandemic . 
 3M’s pandemic preparedness plan addresses disease prevention and control, and maintenance 
of business continuity. Response measures for disease prevention and control are categorized 
under the following areas: public health communication and education; medical prevention and 
protection; social distancing and medical surveillance; workplace hygiene; medical supplies and 
resources; and business travel, Foreign Service employees and families.  
 The plan utilizes mater ials and best practices from a number of resources including pandemic 
planning recommendations from the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, government and other multinational company plans.  
 Our Corporate Crisis Management Team manages a wide range of crisis situations including 
pandemic preparedness.  Every 3M facility has a facility/country crisis management team , plan, 
and associated communication/response strategies developed in the event of a pandemic 
situation.  3M Corporate Occupational Medicine monitors  global  pandemic alerts and 
communicates the level of response depending on both the level of person to person contact and how widespread the disease is in humans.  
 
E
NGAGING OUR SUPPLIERS  
All 3M suppliers are expected to comply with applicable laws.  Those expectations are 
embedded in 3M Contract and Purchase Order terms.  3M supplements those contractual 
requirements with Supply Chain Policies that specifically address environmental, health, safety, 
transportation and labor/human resources practices and the content/origin of materials supplied 
to 3M. Those Policies apply to the selection and retention of suppliers and establish a 
framework that 3M considers important to a safe and healthy workplace, the maintenanc e of fair 
and reasonable labor and human resource practices (including the prohibition of slavery and 
human trafficking), management of manufacturing and distribution operations to minimize 
adverse environmental impact and compliance with material content/ origin laws. 3M expects 
suppliers to establish programs that are consistent with those Policies.   
 
 
Supplier EHS/Labor/Transportation Performance 
3M periodically monitors supplier performance against its Policy expectations.  Assessing that 
performance is challenging because of 3M's many thousands of suppliers, numerous supply 
chain tiers and complex global supply chains.   3M has implemented  a risk -based supplier 
assessment process to help assure that its suppliers meet its expectations:  
 
 Suppliers are ranked using a prioritization matrix tool.  
 The matrix takes into account country & type of operations and annual 3M purchases.  
 Prioritized suppliers may be asked to complete a self -assessment survey (SAS).  
 The SAS is used to understand supplier programs and whether they meet the intent of 
3M Policies.  
 An on- site audit may be conducted.  75 
  If any deficiencies are identified during an on -site v isit, a correction plan is developed.  
 3M conducts follow -up audits or other communications to assure that deficiencies are 
corrected.  
 
The supplier audit process covers environmental, health and safety practices and training, 
general  working conditions, emergency  response procedures, hazardous materials 
management including transportation protocols and employment practices.  Audits are  
conducted by 3M staff in most cases, but 3M may use third party audit firms as necessary.  The 
assessment program has in dependent oversight from the 3M EHS Advisory Committee.  
Customer or general public concerns can be brought to 3M’s attention via phone or website  (
www.3M.com/About 3M ). 
 
More than 1,800 s elf-assessments or on -site audits of suppliers have been conducted in China, 
India, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Turkey over the past six years.  Suppliers reviewed in the last three years represent 74% of 3M's 2011 spend in the 
listed countries .  Most suppliers met 3M’s expectations.  Those requiring improvement were 
given specific corrective action in order to retain 3M business. Suppliers with corrective action 
must pass a 3M re- qualification assessment after completing t he necessary steps.  
 
The most common audit findings pertain to machine guarding, human resource documentation 
and pay controls. Most suppliers work very quickly to address any 3M findings.  Those suppliers 
unwilling or unable to take the necessary correcti ve action in a timely manner have been 
terminated by 3M.  
 
In addition to existing suppliers , many potential suppliers have been evaluated using the 
assessment  tools.  Several 3M businesses have incorporated supplier EHS and labor 
considerations into life c ycle management reviews and have independently performed 
assessments of key suppliers.  
 
Supplier Development  
3M communicates its sustainability expectations to suppliers through contract clauses, 
specifications, links to 3M’s website and in direct business  meetings.  Improving energy 
efficiency and reducing waste are common supplier meeting agenda items.  3M has expanded its involvement with the US “Energy Star” program by promoting the pledge program with key 
suppliers and has hosted a best practice seminar.  
 
Sourcing Training  
3M sourcing  staff with responsibility for supplier relationships receive training on all aspects of 
supply chain sustainability, including slavery and human trafficking prohibitions.  Most recently 
3M has provided training on understanding and managing environmental preference factors in 
supplier selection.  
 
Supplier Diversity  
Sourcing from diverse businesses that are small, minority -owned, woman- owned, small veteran-
owned, service- disabled veteran- owned and certified HUBZone is an important factor in how 3M 
purchases goods and services. These businesses comprise a vital, growing segment of our 
economy and offer great potential for helping 3M obtain best value, innovation, growth, and 
diverse goods and services. In addition small and di verse businesses provide economic and 
social energy to the communities in which we operate.  3M is committed to aggressively and 
proactively identifying diverse business sources for all goods and services purchased.  3M 76 
 works to solicit capable firms and execute orders and contracts with those firms as required to 
support 3M business needs. Sourcing personnel have access to various supplier diversity 
directories and resources to assist in identifying sources.  
 When awarding business to diverse suppliers, 3M  also considers the community impact. 
Changing demand patterns may require 3M to reduce spend with a particular supplier.  If 3M 
purchases represent a high percentage of that supplier's total business, local employment 
opportunities can be affected.  3M at tempts to manage its spend levels with individual suppliers 
to avoid this type of community impact.  
 
3M’s Partners and Suppliers website is the gateway to learn more about 3M’s supplier requirements and our diversity initiative: 
www.3M.com/Partners/Suppliers  
 
Supplier Information  
3M uses product responsibility databases and tools to better manage environmental and health and safety information related to 3M products. Extensive efforts have been taken with 3M 
suppliers to gather product composition/origin information and other environmental, health and 
safety data to ensure compliance with applicable laws wherever 3M does business and respond 
to customer inquiries.   
 
Paperless Transactions 
In addition to the  3M Environmental Solutions Catalogs, 3M has worked to e- enable many 
business e- commerce processes. In the US, 85% of purchase orders are sent electronically, 92 
percent of purchase order invoices are received electronically and 75 percent of payments are 
paperless.  This has eliminated tens of thousands of paper documents per year. In a recent 
third -party benchmark study, 3M’s e- commerce results were well above other US best in class 
companies.   
 
Continuing our Progress 
3M is an innovative company and will continue finding new ways to improve supply chain 
sustainability.

 CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  
STAKEHOLDER INTERACTION  
Meeting the Needs and Keeping in Touch  
In our efforts to advance Sustainability, we continuously strive to maintain a continuous and 
open dialogue with the community, shareholders, employees, ret irees and other interested 
parties concerning past achievements and future sustainability goals.  The interconnection of environmental stewardship, societal needs, and market opportunities informs continuous 
reassessment and sustainable development progres s.  We remain committed to providing 
investors with an attractive return through sustained, high quality growth.    
3M shares information regarding our efforts, focus areas, and relative growth through a number 
of online and printed publications, open houses, and facility tours  
 
Engaging Stakeholders 
3M recognizes the connection community stakeholders have to business. The discussions and 
interactions with stakeholders help the company keep awareness of emerging issues and 
respond in a responsible manner.  3M develops engagement plans and communicates with a 
wide variety of stakeholders at the corporate, regional, or local level.  3M strives to meet 
stakeholder expectations at a global level on global issues;  however the majority of stakeholder 
interactions occur at the place where 3M activities touch our stakeholders.  
 
Local and Regional Stakeholder Engagement  
In 2005, 3M developed a new, more systematic local and regional stakeholder engagement 
process. This new method was developed as a formalized process t o help facilities establish a 
consistent, documented, and proactive system to drive engagement.  As part of 3M’s 2015 
Sustainability Goals, facilities selected on a risk prioritized basis are to complete and document 
the following activities:  
 Identify critical stakeholders  
 Analyze and evaluate their current stakeholder engagement activities  
 Identify communications opportunities  
 Identify local community needs and align with 3M’s giving priorities  
 Develop and i mplement a stakeholder engagement plan  
 Measure the plan’s effectiveness  through charitable giving results and engagement 
activities  
 
Stakeholder Engagement Plans  
Approximately 70 manufacturing facilities globally  have completed a stakeholder engagement 
plan. While facilities will develop a stak eholder engagement plan using developed guidelines , 
the engagement tactics employed by each location are developed to meet the needs of regional 
or local stakeholders.  3M locations use a wide range of methods to consult and interact with 
stakeholders:  
 Neighbor Meetings  
 Employee Meetings  
 Employee Surveys  
 Community New sletters  
 Facility Open Houses and Tours  
 Active Participation in Local Civic Groups  
 Participation in community organizations (e.g. chambers of commerce, task forces , 
nonprofit boards, mentoring in schools ) 
 Facility Websites  78 
 COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT  
Our goal is to positively impact 3M communities, and prepare individuals and families for 
success through support of education, health and human services, the arts, and the 
environment with the following areas of emphasis:  
 Education : Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM); and 
Economics/Business education to prepare students for future careers  
 Health and Human Services : Support of United Way in 3M communities, disaster relief; 
and programs that promote youth development through quality out -of-school programs 
and early childhood education 
 Arts and Culture : Premier arts organizations with educational outreach and diverse 
programming  
 Environment : Make a lasting impact on the Earth’s ecosystems and promote science 
based environmental and conservation education  
 Volunteer and Civic : Engage, recognize and support 3M volunteers  
 
Global community giving and involvement is decentralized with 3M subsidiaries in each country 
developing and administering programs that are consistent with the local culture, community 
needs, and the environment  in which they operate.  In the United States, 16 community 
relations councils develop regional strategies and direct local charitable giving.  
 
GLOBAL CONTRIBUTIONS  
Contributions from 3M and 3M Foundation supports education, health and human services, arts 
and culture, and environmental organizations that:  
 Are established, well -managed non- profit groups that are classified as charitable 
organizations for tax purposes and located in 3M communities  
 Provide broad- based community support with a r eputation for high- quality service 
delivery and measureable results  
 Develop close relationships with community to identify changing needs

 REPORT DATA COLLECTION , ADJUSTMENTS  AND VERIFICATION  
DATA PERIOD  
The data provided in this report through facts and figures are based on activities during 3M’s 
fiscal year 2011 (January 1, 2011- December 31, 2011).  For some performance indicators 
previous year’s data is provided to allow for annual comparis ons. 
 
REPORT DATA COLLECTION  
Due to the size and geographical extent of our operations, it is at times difficult to obtain all data 
points.  Therefore to the extent possible, limitations and assumptions are stated as information 
is presented in the report.  The data reported in  this report  has been reviewed for accuracy and 
completeness, including the reliability of the systems used to obtain the data by corporate staff 
professional s in each area.  Corporate staff have also verified the implementation of policies 
and management systems through audits and self -reporting systems.  
 
• Financial Data:  Financial information referenced in this report is collected and reporting 
in accordance to United States Securities and Exchange Commission through the 2011 
Annual Report.  
 
• Environmental,  Health, and Safety Data:  The environmental, health, and safety data in 
this report is related to release to the environment, safety performance, management 
systems implementation,  and regulatory compliance.  Data collection system s are in 
place at the applicable sites  to track and collect environmental and safety data through 
the corporate- wide EHS reporting systems ( e.g. Environmental Targets Database, 
Worldwide Incident Management System) . 
 
• Social Data :  The data related to employee metrics and community  programs has been 
derived from various databases from with in the Human Resources and Community 
Affairs Organizations.  This data has been reviewed and verified by the departments responsible for maintaining the internal reporting systems.    
 Sites acquired  by 3M are integrated into 3M  programs and reporting systems via a staged 
approach.  Timeframe for integration varies depending on subject matter reporting requirements 
and site systems  prior to being acquired, however on average ranges between 1 and 3 years.   
BASE YEAR AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS  
3M’s annual report (10K) and investor relations web site documents any changes to financial data.  Several of 3M’s environmental goals are normalized per net sales.  3M does not adjust 
sales data for inflation.  
 
3M generally does not adjust its base year environmental metrics data to reflect changes in 
3M’s organi zation structure.  As a result, 3M sets environmental targets that are normalized or 
indexed to production (tons emitted/net sales) to ensure the environmental  progress we report 
publically is not unduly influence by changes to our organizational structure.  However, in the 
case of our greenhouse gas emissions data, 3M follows the World Resource Institute and World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development’s GHG protocol.  Consequently, we readjust our 
greenhouse gas emissions base year data in the case of business acquisitions and divestitures.  
 87 
 In every case, 3M adjusts base year and other year’s data if data collection methods change or 
data errors are identified.  Any significant changes in the measurement methods and/or data 
values applied to key envi ronmental metrics  from previous years are documented with the 
report’s content.  Significant changes are defined by 3M’s Sustainability Report as changes greater than 5 % of the original data point.  In the case of minor changes less than 5% of the 
original data point , the data point is modified to reflect the mi nor changes in measurement 
method or data . 
 
In 2011, 3M returned to a more conventional definition of waste which considered recycling as 
neutral (contributing neither toward total waste or toward good output).  Between 2005 and 
2010 3M adopted a different definition of waste to drive the company’s waste reduction efforts toward more sustainable solutions, such as pollution prevention.  3M’s waste reduction goal  and 
progress during this period included recycling.  Waste data is reported in this report using both 
definitions.  When total waste is discussed in general, a conventional recycling neutral definition 
is used.  
 In 2007, data entry errors were identified at four 3M manufacturing facilities through internal and 
external auditing. The correction of these errors led to a 5.8% increase in 3M’s 2006 reported 
VOC emissions and a 1.2 % increas e in the company’s reported waste generation.  In 2009, 
there were no significant changes to 3M’s sustainability data.  
 
3M adjusts social metrics per the requirements of polices, standards, and regulations in those respective areas.  For example employee headcount metrics would be reinstated accordingly if 
reorganization occurs to an existing legal entity.  
REPORT AND DATA VERIFICATION  
3M’s 2011 Sustainability report was prepared using the Global Reporting Initiative’s G3.1 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines . GRI is a voluntary reporting protocol used and supported
