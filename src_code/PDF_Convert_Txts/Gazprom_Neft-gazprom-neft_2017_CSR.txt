GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017DEAR FRIENDS, 
Gazprom Neft achieved excellent production and financial 
results in 2017. The Company had the largest increase 
in hydrocarbon production in the Russian oil industry 
at 4.1%, while also significantly expanding its resource 
base. Premium sales also grew by 3.8%. Major efforts were 
put into enhancing the efficiency of business processes 
and optimizing costs. As a result, Gazprom Neft generated 
the highest net profit in the Company’s history in 2017.
We view our employees as our most valuable asset. Today, 
Gazprom Neft employs more than 67,000 people. According 
to the international Randstad Award rating, the Company 
is one of the country’s most attractive employers. Gazprom 
Neft implements programmes involving financial and non-
financial incentives, social support, and development 
for its employees and also puts together a talent pool. 
The Corporate University expanded the scope and quality 
of training and opened several new departments in 2017. 
Its innovative service platform model not only makes 
it possible to bring in external providers for training, 
but to also establish communication between employees who 
need to study and their colleagues who can teach them. 
One of the Company’s top priorities is industrial safety. 
We are committed to our strategic ‘Goal – Zero’ of causing 
absolutely no harm to people, the environment, or property 
when performing work. The Company’s injury rate 
decreased by 19% in 2017 compared with the previous year, 
the number of major traffic accidents declined by 75%, 
and qualitative changes were made to the requirements 
and tools for the monitoring of major construction projects. 
The Company pays special attention to creating an industrial 
safety culture at all its assets. While aiming for more, Gazprom Neft unwaveringly 
adheres to the principles of corporate social responsibility 
and sustainable development. The launch of the Biosphera 
treatment facilities at the Moscow Oil Refinery, in which 
the Company invested RUB 9 billion, was a major milestone 
for Gazprom Neft in 2017. The Biosphera facilities purify 
99.9% of the refinery’s wastewater, which is consistent 
with best global practices and significantly exceeds 
the regulatory requirements. A similar project is currently 
being implemented at the Omsk Oil Refinery. During 
the Year of Ecology, which was held in Russia last year, 
the Company implemented more than 1,000 events, ranging 
from the completion of infrastructure for associated 
petroleum gas utilization at the Novoportovskoye field 
to the implementation of projects to preserve the biodiversity 
of the Arctic.
In 2017, Gazprom Neft moved forward with its ‘Native 
Towns’ social investments programme, whose main goal 
is to systematically improve the quality of life in the regions 
where the Company operates. The programme has resulted 
in positive changes in dozens of regions of the Russian 
Federation, where active residents have been given 
the opportunity to implement important social initiatives. 
Over 2,000 projects have been implemented in 35 regions 
as part of the ‘Native Towns’ programme over five years 
with total investment of more than RUB 20 billion. 
Today, the Company’s success at the international level 
is measured not only by its production and financial 
performance, but also by the way it treats its employees, 
the territories where it operates, and the environment. 
For Gazprom Neft, investment in human capital, concern 
for the safety of all production processes, protecting nature, 
and developing social programmes are just as important 
tasks as the effective implementation of business projects.MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARDALEXANDER DYUKOV

BY IMPLEMENTING THE PLANS OUTLINED IN THE STRATEGY, THE COMPANY AIMS TO CREATE 
THE HIGHEST ADDED VALUE IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN RUSSIA ON THE CAPITAL INVESTED 
BY ITS SHAREHOLDERS.
To this end, the Company has introduced an operational 
management system (OMS) that facilitates the overall 
development of the organization and encompasses such 
important areas as enhancing occupational safety, improving 
asset reliability, boosting efficiency, and optimizing 
the Company’s operations as a whole. The OMS is designed 
to integrate these activities into a unified system 
and strengthen the links between different systems, 
standards, and regulations.
1 — The national classification of reserves and resources 
of oil, gas, condensate and components contained  
therein , from the industrial value.
The Novoportovskoye field is the northernmost 
and one of the largest oil and gas condensate fields 
on the Yamal Peninsula. Novy Port light crude oil is produced 
at the field with a low sulphur content (about 0.1%). The Gates 
of the Arctic, a unique marine terminal that is designed 
to operate at low temperatures, handles year-round 
shipments of crude oil. ‘Zero discharge’ technology 
prevents pollutants from entering the waters of Ob Bay. 
The Company is building its own fleet, including modern 
icebreakers and Arctic tankers, in order to transport oil along 
the Northern Sea Route.The first stage of the East Messoyakha field was put into 
operation in 2016. Fishbone technology was used in the field’s 
development to build wells with multiple horizontal branches 
that lead to separate oil fields without without penetrating 
the layers containing gas or water.Complex technical and logistical solutions were used 
to develop the field located beyond the Arctic Circle 
in order to minimize the impact on the Arctic ecosystem. 
The Company built special deer crossings when routing 
pipelines in areas of deer migration as well as underground 
crossings under the large Muduyahu and Indikyahu rivers. 
Modern equipment reduces water consumption by 25%.

In 2011, Gazprom Neft launched the large-scale 
modernization of the Moscow Oil Refinery for a total cost 
of more than RUB 250 billion in an effort to achieve the best 
production and environmental safety standards. The first 
stage of modernization resulted in the Moscow Oil Refinery 
transitioning to the production of high-class Euro-5 fuel 
in 2013 ahead of schedule. The second stage, which will last 
from 2016 to 2023, is designed to increase the operational 
and environmental efficiency of production while further 
increasing refining volumes and improving product quality. 
A key project of the second stage is the construction 
of a new combined Euro + oil refinery that will replace 
several existing previous generation installations and will 
reduce pollutant emissions by 11% per 1 tonne of refined 
oil. As part of the second stage of modernization, a deep oil 
refining complex will be built within the hydrocracking unit 
and delayed coking unit. Projects are also being implemented 
to modernize the primary refining unit of crude vacuum unit 6 
and to rebuild the catalytic cracking complex G-43-107.The successful implementation of the projects making up 
the first stage of the Omsk Oil Refinery’s modernization 
enabled the refinery to fully switch to the production 
of Euro-5 motor fuels and significantly increase energy 
efficiency and eco-friendliness. The second stage, which 
will run from 2015 to 2025, aims to increase the depth of oil 
refining to 99% and involves the construction of new facilities, 
the renovation of production facilities, and the improved eco-
friendliness, reliability, and safety of production processes.
Projects to increase refining depth at the Omsk Oil 
Refinery shifted to the stage of practical implementation 
in 2016. A deep oil refining complex is being built 
at the refinery within hydrocracking units that have capacity 
of 2 million tonnes of vacuum gas oil per year. A delayed 
coking plant with capacity of 2 million tonnes per year 
is also under construction. These projects will increase 
the production of high-margin products and provide 
the market with raw materials for group 2 and 3 base 
oils as well as petroleum coke, a valuable raw material 
for the aluminium industry.
The most important project resulting from the ecological 
modernization of the Omsk and Moscow Oil Refineries 
was the construction of the Biosphera modern treatment 
facilities, which will ensure 99.9% efficiency for wastewater 
treatment. In 2017, Gazprom Neft completed the construction 
of treatment facilities at the Moscow Oil Refinery and began 
implementing a similar project at the Omsk Oil Refinery.
Gazprom Neft intends to invest over RUB 400 billion 
in the development of the Omsk and Moscow Oil Refineries 
over the next five years.A scientific consortium consisting of Moscow State University, 
Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Gubkin Russian 
State University of Oil and Gas, the Skolkovo Technical 
Centre, and Gazprom Neft as a production partner was 
established to study the Bazhenov formation. Gazprom Neft 
and its partners are setting up the Bazhen Technological 
Centre at the key test site – the Palyanovskaya area 
of the Krasnoleninskoye field in Yugra – as an open platform 
for the development of technologies. The project was granted 
national status in 2017. 
The resource base of the Company’s current assets has been 
marked by a deterioration in the structure of the remaining 
industrial reserves as most fields enter into the late stage 
of development. Fields in the third and fourth stages 
of development accounted for more than 30% of the oil 
produced at Gazprom Neft’s current assets (100%) in 2017. 
However, due to the increased use of high-tech drilling 
and tertiary methods for boosting oil recovery, the Company Development of mature fields
is consistently enhancing the efficiency of the development 
of these reserves.
In addition, gas production increased by 1.2 billion cubic m 
in 2017 versus the previous year due to an additional 
programme involving geological and technical measures 
at mature fields.BAZHEN TECHNOLOGICAL CENTRE MODERNIZATION OF OIL REFINERIES

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017Gazprom Neft PJSC intends to increase hydrocarbon production to 100 million TOE 
per year by 2020 and continue to increase production until 2025. The Company plans 
to maintain a 15-year ratio of proven reserves to production. In order to achieve 
these goals, Gazprom Neft will strive to employ the most cost-effective methods 
to recover the remaining reserves from the current resource base by utilizing 
the best practices for optimizing field development, reducing the cost of proven 
technologies as well as acquiring and introducing new technologies. 
The strategy involves the establishment of a new production centre in the north 
of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District (YNAD). Gazprom Neft is considering 
unconventional reserves as a growth opportunity and will develop this class 
of assets as a key component of its portfolio.The Gazprom Group increased 
hydrocarbon production by 4.1% YoY 
to 89.75 million TOE in 2017. Increased 
production at the Novoportovskoye, 
Messoyakha, and Prirazlomnoye fields 
as well as in Iraq enabled the Company 
to increase hydrocarbon production 
year-on-year.
The Group boosted oil and condensate 
production by 4.3% YoY to 62.43 million 
tonnes. The Company ranked third 
in Russia in terms of oil production 
behind Rosneft and LUKOIL in 2017.
Gas production grew by 3.7% versus 
2016 to 34 billion m3 due to an increase 
in APG utilization and expanded natural 
gas production in the Noyabrsk region.Gazprom Neft reduced oil refining by 4% 
in 2017 as a result of planned overhauls 
and the reconstruction of production 
facilities at the Company’s Russian 
refineries. 
The decrease in the production 
volume of high-octane petrol gasoline 
and diesel fuel by 6.3% and 4.7% 
YoY, respectively, is due to a general 
decrease in the volume of oil refining 
at the Omsk and Moscow Oil Refineries. 
The 27.2% YoY increase in bitumen 
production resulted from growing 
demand on the domestic market 
and the expanded geography 
of exports. Fuel oil production 
declined compared with 2016 because 
of a decrease in oil refining as well 
as increase bitumen production.Key performance indicators (KPI) for 2025 Key performance indicators (KPI) for 2025STRATEGIC GOALS

RESULTS OF 2017
Oil sales increased by 16.8% 
in 2017 due to an increase in exports 
and international oil sales1. Exports 
to non-CIS countries increased by 41.1% 
compared with 2016. Gas sales grew 
by 7.8% to 14.43 billion m3.
The decrease in oil sales 
on the domestic market in 2017 
is primarily the result of the diminished 
economic efficiency of trading 
operations. 
The Company sold 43.48 million 
tonnes of petroleum products in 2017, 
a 0.3% decrease from the previous 
year. This is above all attributable 
to a decrease in fuel oil exports 
to non-CIS countries due to a reduction 
in its production volume. Petroleum 
product sales on the Russian market 
in 2017 exceeded the 2016 level 
by 3.1%. Sales increased for the entire 
range of petroleum products, except 
for marine fuel and petrochemical 
products.2013 2014 2015 2016 2017

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017MILESTONES OF THE YEAR
The drilling of two horizontal wells with multi-stage 
hydraulic fracturing at the Palyanovskaya area in 2016 
resulted in a commercial oil flow from the Bazhenov 
formation. The MSHF GROWTH software developed 
by the Company as part of a research consortium in 2017 
was tested at the wells of the Bazhenov formation. 
This solution – the world’s first hydraulic fracturing 
simulator in the conditions of the Bazhenov formation – 
makes it possible to simulate the formation of cracks 
in the reservoir, predict the oil flow, and select the optimal 
hydraulic fracturing parameters.
Gazprom Neft and the Government of the Khanty-Mansi 
Autonomous District agreed to establish a technology 
development centre for production from the Bazhenov 
formation in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District – 
the Bazhen Technological Centre. The centre, which 
is a new legal entity with the status of a technological 
testing site, is scheduled to open in 2018.
The active phase of the pilot project for soda-surfactant 
polymer flooding at the West Salymskoye field is close 
to completion. The project resulted in a 15% increase in oil 
recovery, which indicates the new solution has a high level 
of technological efficiency.Gazpromneft-Khantos launched the Upstream Control 
Centre (UCC), which was established as part of the Digital 
Field programme. The Centre consolidated previously 
developed solutions to increase the efficiency of individual 
extraction processes into a unified integrated environment. 
The Centre will reduce operating costs by 15%.
The Hydraulic Fracturing Scientific and Technical 
Support Centre was established in partnership 
with the Engineering Centre of Moscow Institute of Physics 
and Technology.
The well design was optimized at the Tsarichanskoye 
field. A project was successfully implemented to utilize 
a dual-shaft design for the first time in Russia as well 
as a set of technological solutions (geomechanics, foam 
cementing) that made it possible to carry out drilling 
and cementing in conditions of disastrous drilling mud 
losses. Seventeen wells were drilled using this approach. 
Total savings exceeded the project’s cost by more than 
four-fold. Total drilling costs were reduced by more than 
RUB 840 million.
The Company worked on creating a set of IT solutions 
for the ‘Cognitive Geologist Assistant’, which will boost 
the efficiency of preparing geological solutions by several 
times, more than double the speed of data processing, 
and reduce the cost of extracting information by a third.OIL REFINING
The oil refining segment employs a long-term R&D strategy as part of which 
a portfolio of innovative projects has been established in the priority areas 
of technological development. Introducing their results at the Company's refineries 
will increase the yield of high-margin products given the technological conditions 
of a particular refinery and also reduce operating costs.
MILESTONES OF THE YEAR
The Downstream Efficiency Control Centre (ECC) was 
established within the Downstream Division. The Centre’s 
objective is to build a unified digital platform to manage 
the efficiency of the value chain from oil supplies 
to the refinery to the sale of petroleum products to the end 
user. A total of 250,000 automated monitoring sensors 
and dozens of production processes management system 
transmit information in real time about the demand 
for petroleum products, the state of equipment, 
and the quality of raw materials to the ECC. The Centre 
has created a ‘data lake’ where management decisions 
are made based on an analysis of the data. The Centre 
will have a significant economic impact by optimizing all 
processes and enhancing the reliability of production.
Gazprom Neft successfully introduced its own catalysts 
and technological solutions as part of a project to develop 
the production of catalysts for oil refining: 
 –catalytic cracking: the new brand of Avangard catalysts 
in which the catalytic cracking unit increases the yield 
of petrol by 3.7%; –oligomerization: the new KOB-1 catalyst increased 
service cycle duration by two-fold and the yield 
of the high-octane component of petrol by 30%;
 –isodewaxing: the new catalyst without precious metals 
ensured the production of winter and Arctic grade diesel 
fuel in accordance with the production programme;
 –new process for the reactivation of the diesel fuel 
hydrotreating catalyst: the Omsk Oil Refinery efficiently 
operated the reactivated catalyst for a year instead 
of the planned six months, thus reducing expenses 
on the purchase of a fresh catalyst by 55%.
The Company concluded general agreements until 
2025 on matters concerning the development catalysts 
for oil refining with its strategic scientific partners – 
the Boreskov Institute of Catalysis (Novosibirsk) 
and the Institute for Hydrocarbon Processing Problems 
of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
(Omsk).30

IMPLEMENTED IN 2017
Yury Zlotnikov
Director of the Oil and Gas Refining Department, 
Russian Ministry of Energy“The process proposed by Gazprom Neft 
specialists provides unique advantages in terms 
of working in a non-corrosive environment, 
obtaining a higher octane number, and lower 
capital costs than in plants with mineral acids”.In 2017, the project committee under the Ministry 
of Energy of the Russian Federation approved 
Gazprom Neft’s project to create an environmentally 
safe solid acid alkylation technology – an innovative 
waste-free technology for the production of the high-
octane component of Euro 5 petrol. The commercial 
introduction of the technology at the Moscow Oil Refinery 
will ensure the production of more than 100,000 tonnes 
of alkylbenzene per year. The Company completed 
construction on Russia's first pilot plant for solid acid 
alkylation with capacity of 300 tonnes of products per year 
as part of a project in Elektrogorsk. Solid acid alkylationTHE FIRST IT PLATFORM FOR SEISMIC EXPLORATION
In 2017, Gazprom Neft, in collaboration with Yandex.
Terra, Pangea, and the Moscow Institute of Physics 
and Technology, began building Russia's first integrated 
platform for the processing and interpretation 
of seismic data that can accompany the whole cycle 
of seismic studies – from setting goals to completing 
projects. The software will be able to solve problems 
ranging from selecting promising sites and interpreting 
data to suggesting ideas for creating seismic 
geological models. In the future, the prototype 
will be supplemented with algorithms to process big 
data and make decisions. The new software products 
are being developed as part of the Electronic Asset 
Development (EDA) programme. The program 
encompasses all major areas of the Company's 
operations in the upstream segment: exploration, 
drilling, development, production, and the development 
of fields.Timur Tavberidze
CEO of the Engineering Centre of Moscow 
Institute of Physics and Technology“In today’s oil and gas industry, decision-making 
is based on data that is growing exponentially 
in volume. The Big Data paradigm allows 
for adapting business strategies for such 
explosive growth rates, while modern methods 
of data analysis, such as machine learning 
and convolutional neural networks, make it possible 
to take a fundamentally new approach to solving 
pressing problems”.

An integrated management system is used to manage the choice of counterparties 
and work with them. The Materials and Equipment Procurement Unit 
of Gazpromneft-Supply underwent an annual audit using this system during 
the reporting year. The Company's counterparties for the supply of goods, works, 
and services are selected in a unified manner based on the results of a competitive 
procedure for selecting counterparties.
In 2017, the Company launched the Supplier Management System, which provides 
a prequalification assessment of materials and equipment suppliers for compliance 
with corporate requirements prior to their involvement in competitive procedures.
The basic criteria for the selection of contractors are the cost and quality 
of and the timeframe for manufacturing and delivery / performance of work / 
rendering of services, the counterparty’s availability of the relevant technical 
and human resources, and the experience required to perform the work / 
render the services in the relevant area. One of the key selection criteria 
is the counterparty's compliance with the Company's industrial safety rules. 
The Company concludes an industrial safety agreement with the selected 
counterparties. 
In 2017, the Company involved 4,553 suppliers of materials and equipment 
in competitive procedures and concluded contracts with 2,076 suppliers. Payments 
to suppliers amounted to RUB 124 billion.
The Company continued to have a consistently high level of small and medium-sized 
businesses involved in procurements. Small and medium-sized businesses made 
up more than 30% of centralized purchases of materials and equipment in 2017.ASSESSMENT OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The Company assesses the satisfaction of retail consumers with the quality 
of motor fuel and service in regular sociological polls, studying feedback given 
at CRM system touch screens in the checkout area of filling stations, and analysing 
comments and inquiries sent via the Company’s Hotline and social media.

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017Starting from 2015, the Company has 
identified 30 critical areas for import 
substitution for which it developed 
and is implementing Alternative 
Substitution Strategies to stimulate 
the Russian production of the required 
goods and services. The Company 
is also developing cooperation 
with stakeholders in order to more 
effectively meet the import substitution 
challenges. 
Gazprom Neft is the moderator 
of five expert groups within 
an interdepartmental working 
group that was formed to address 
the import substitution objectives 
set by the Ministry of Industry 
and Trade of the Russian Federation 
jointly with the Ministry of Energy 
of the Russian Federation in such areas 
as equipment for the development 
of hard-to-recover reserves, 
catalysts and additives, software, and technologies for the manufacturing 
of spare parts, tools, 
and accessories. In 2017, Gazprom 
Neft initiated the establishment 
of a working group to introduce 
a methodology for organizing 
and conducting the qualified 
selection and accreditation 
of equipment from foreign licensors 
and EPC contractors. The group 
works to stimulate the process 
of accrediting domestic equipment 
manufacturers in an effort to increase 
the proportion of Russian equipment 
used in the process of modernizing 
oil refineries, oil and gas chemistry, 
and LNG from the current 30% to 80%.1 
The group is to be set up in 2018.
Gazprom Neft concluded strategic 
partnership agreements on import 
substitution in 2017 with Rosatom 
State Corporation, St. Petersburg State 
Maritime Technical University, United Shipbuilding Corporation, and Siemens 
AG and continued its activities 
in the joint working groups of GPB 
Bank and the GMS Group with Russian 
enterprises that manufacture 
import-substituting products.
Significant results of the Company’s 
cooperation with other organizations 
in 2017 included the testing of the first 
Russian complex for offshore seismic 
operations at the Dolginsky 
license area as well as an alpha 
version of the hydraulic fracturing 
simulation software package created 
by a consortium led by the Moscow 
Institute of Physics and Technology 
as part of the development 
of the Bazhenov formation. Information 
is also presented in the ‘Regional policy

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT47
// 46
GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017The Board of Directors handles 
the day-to-day management 
of the Company's activities. As part 
of its purview, the Board of Directors 
determines the strategy, policies, 
and main principles of the Company's 
operations, including its investments 
and borrowings, risk management, 
and the management of property 
and other activities, and also monitors 
their implementation.
The Board of Directors includes 13 
people: 10 non-executive directors 
who represent the interests 
of the controlling shareholder – 
Gazprom PJSC, two independent 
directors, and the Company’s 
CEO. Gazprom Neft is guided 
by the independence criteria that 
are enshrined in the Code of Corporate 
Governance of the Central Bank 
of the Russian Federation. Gazprom 
Neft ensures the members 
of the Board of Directors are elected 
via a transparent procedure. The Board 
of Directors is balanced insofar 
as its members possess the key skills that are essential for effective 
work. The members of the Board 
of Directors have skills in accounting, 
strategic management, corporate 
governance, corporate finance, and risk 
management as well as industry-
based experience and knowledge.1 
When performing their functions, 
Board members actively interact 
with the Company’s management, 
structural units, the registrar, 
and the auditor. 
The existing structure 
of the Board of Directors provides 
an appropriate level of independence 
from the Company's management, 
which helps to ensure the proper 
monitoring of its work.
The Management Board 
and the CEO – the Company’s 
executive bodies – are accountable 
to the Board of Directors 
and the General Shareholders Meeting. 
The CEO of Gazprom Neft is Alexander 
Dyukov. The Company strives to maintain a balance of interests between shareholders 
and management. The Company’s main shareholder has a sufficient number of votes 
to pass decisions on a significant number of issues that fall within the purview 
of the General Meeting of Shareholders and also to form the Board of Directors. 
Despite this, the Company seeks to utilize tools that feature a high concentration 
of equity to mitigate risks related to the specific nature of management.
Internal documents – the Corporate Code and the Code of Corporate Governance – 
serve as the foundation for resolving conflicts of interest. Gazprom Neft has created 
a Corporate Culture and Ethics Working Committee, which monitors compliance 
with the provisions of the Company’s Code. The Committee includes members 
of the Management Board.
In accordance with the Code of Corporate Governance, members of the Board 
of Directors must:
refrain from taking actions that could lead to a conflict of interest
refrain from voting on issues in which they have a personal interest 
in their decision-making
not disclose or use confidential and/or insider information about the Company 
in their own personal interests or the interests of third parties
There were no conflicts of interests among members of the Gazprom Neft Board 
of Directors and Management Board in 2017.BALANCE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

the approval of the Policy on Annual Bonuses for Gazprom Neft Group 
employeesREMUNERATION FOR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
AND MANAGEMENT BOARD
The Company has a clearly structured 
and objective Remuneration 
Programme for top and senior 
executives that ensures a connection 
between short-term goals 
and the amount of bonus payments. 
In addition to bonuses tied to short-
term results, the Company has 
a motivation system based 
on the dynamics of the Company’s 
market capitalization over a three-year 
period. 
The remuneration system for members 
of the Company’s Management 
Board includes the base portion 
of remuneration, which is determined 
on an individual basis and fixed 
in the employment contract, an annual 
bonus and a long-term incentive 
programme.
The amount of the annual bonus 
for key senior executives is dependent on the degree to which they fulfilled 
a fixed set of KPIs and business 
initiatives. This list of KPIs includes 
performance indicators with respect 
to the Company’s strategic goals, 
corporate, financial, and performance 
targets as well as indicators 
demonstrating compliance 
with industrial safety standards. 
In addition to the annual bonus, 
Gazprom Neft employs a long-
term incentive programme based 
on the dynamics of the Company’s 
market capitalization over a three-year 
period. Members of the Management 
Board are not paid any additional 
remuneration for work 
in the management bodies of Gazprom 
Neft or its subsidiaries. Management 
Board members received total 
income of RUB 1.285 billion in 2017. 
Payments include work remuneration 
for the reporting period, taxes and other mandatory payments 
to relevant budgets and extra-
budgetary funds, bonuses, the payment 
of annual work leave during 
the reporting period, and payment 
for medical treatment and services.
The amount of remuneration 
for members of the Board of Directors 
depends on the Company’s financial 
results and is annually approved 
by shareholders, which eliminates 
the risk of potential abuses 
of the remuneration programme.
A total of RUB 303.37 million 
in remuneration was paid 
to members of the Board of Directors 
in 2017 (remuneration includes 
personal income tax). Members 
of the Board of Directors did not receive 
compensation for expenses related 
to their participation on the Board 
of Directors in 2017.MECHANISMS TO ELIMINATE A POTENTIAL  
CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
Internal documents – 
the Corporate Code 
and the Code of Corporate 
Governance – serve 
as the foundation for resolving

OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM. DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL  
CONTROL FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Company continued 
to implement a project in 2017 
to introduce a solution to automate 
internal control functions based 
on the SAP GRC Process Control 
system. The further development 
of this project extended coverage 
to risks involving the distortion 
of financial statements at all major 
subsidiaries. A project was also 
launched during the reporting 
year to develop the existing system 
of internal tax control taking 
into account the requirements 
of the Federal Tax Service 
for the Company’s internal control 
service. The project aims to identify 
and eliminate the risk of distortions 
to tax reporting.

the principles and approaches used 
for the organization and operation 
of the Company’s internal control 
system (ICS) and conducts a high-
level analysis and assessment of its

and support high ethical standards 
at all levels of the Company’s activities, 
and conduct a regular performance 
assessment of the Company’s 
employees and train staff on internal 
control.
The heads of structural units 
and the Company as a whole perform 
functions that aim to develop, 
document, introduce, fulfil, monitor 
(self-assessment), and improve control 
procedures within the framework 
of their relevant competencies 
and in the zone of their responsibility 
and also timely inform supervisors 
about incidents when it is impossible 
to perform control procedures for any 
reason and/or changes must be made 
to control procedures due to changes 
to the internal and external conditions 
of the Company’s operation. 
The Audit Commission monitors 
the compilation of reliable financial 
statements and other information about the Company’s financial 
and business activities and property 
status.
The Internal Audit Department

and objective assessment 
of the effective organization 
and functioning of the ICS and risk 
management, drafts and monitors

of recommendations to eliminate 
shortcomings identified during audits, 
reports on the results of the ICS 
assessment, and offers suggestions

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT53
// 52
GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017The Company employs a Risk Management Policy that 
describes the goals and principles of risk management.
Gazprom Neft’s goal in risk management is to improve 
the effectiveness of management decisions by analysing 
the risks that accompany them and to maximize 
the effectiveness of risk management measures when 
implementing decisions that are adopted.
Risk management is managed using the appropriate 
tools that are integrated into key corporate processes. 
Responsibility for risk management and preparing 
reporting on risk management is determined in accordance 
with the system of linear and functional management. 
An owner is appointed for each risk and is responsible 
for managing it. Risk coordinators who promote and support 
the use of corporate risk management principles are selected 
from among managers at the level of each function and key 
business process. This approach makes it possible to identify areas 
of responsibility for risk management and to monitor 
risks at all levels of the Company’s management as well 
as ensure the development of targeted plans for responding 
to significant risks at each subsidiary as well as Gazprom Neft 
as a whole.
In order to achieve this goal, the Company has developed 
and employs a unified approach to the risk management 
process, which forms the Integrated Risk Management 
System (IRMS) in conjunction with standardized risk analysis 
tools and methods.
The Company continuously expands the methodological 
framework of the IRMS, including general recommendations 
on the quantitative risk assessment of project and business 
planning as well as detailed methods for assessing the most 
substantial risks.
As of the end of 2017, the IRMS extended to all Gazprom Neft’s 
core assets. When starting new projects or acquiring existing 
assets, they are always incorporated into the IRMS.MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
Risk description Risk management measures
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN RESOURCES
The Company’s business depends on key highly skilled employees, 
and the lack of the required amount of skilled labour, in particular 
in engineering and technology, could lead to risks associated 
with staff shortages. The Company’s success largely depends 
on the efforts and abilities of key employees, including skilled 
technical staff, as well as on the Company's ability to attract 
and retain such staff. Competition for human resources in Russia 
and abroad may intensify due to the limited number of skilled 
specialists on the labour market. The inability to attract new skilled 
human resources and/or retain existing skilled staff could adversely 
affect the Company’s appeal as an employer. Demand for and related 
expenses on skilled employees are expected to continue growing 
as a reflection of the significant interest in them from other industries 
and social projects.The company offers a safe working environment and competitive 
salaries, and also provides training for employees on specially 
created programmes. In addition, the Company is improving its 
recruitment procedures and implementing measures that aim 
to reduce staff turnover and facilitate the personal development 
of its employees.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRIAL SAFETY
The Company is exposed to risks associated with the safety of its 
employees, equipment, buildings, and facilities. Many factors can 
have an adverse impact on the Company’s core business, including 
the breakdown or failure of equipment, labour disputes, injuries 
to staff and third parties, natural disasters and terrorist attacks. 
Any of these risk factors may have a material adverse effect 
on the Company's business, financial standing, and its performance 
results.In an effort to mitigate these risks, the Company is implementing 
a large-scale integrated programme that aims to ensure safe 
working conditions for employees and the safety of production 
processes. This programme is consistent with best practices 
around the world and is based on enhancing the role of production 
managers at all levels as regards ensuring work safety. 
The Company effectively applies the experience of international 
oil companies while adapting it to the conditions of its own 
production sites. In particular, the Company is introducing 
behavioural safety audits and conducts internal investigations 
of incidents in order to determine their causes and prevent them 
from recurring. Gazprom Neft is implementing its Transport 
Safety Programme, has introduced risk assessments for high-
risk work, and is organizing large-scale educational and training 
sessions and seminars for all levels of the organization. 
The safety management system at production facilities is certified 
for compliance with the international standard OHSAS 18001, 
continuous improvements are being made, and priorities are being 
selected in this system for the coming years. 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
Gazprom Neft’s production activities are fraught with the potential 
risk of an excessive environmental impact, which could lead to civil 
liability and the need for work to eliminate any damage caused. 
The Company is fully aware of its responsibility to society for creating 
safe working conditions and preserving a favourable environment, 
constantly monitors its activities in order to comply with the appro -
priate environmental standards, and is implementing environmen -
tal protection programmes. Costs associated with the observa -
tion of environmental requirements or obligations may increase 
in the future.Gazprom Neft’s industrial safety policy aims to ensure 
compliance with the requirements of the existing environmental 
legislation of the Russian Federation by investing significant 
funds in environmental protection activities, including the use 
of technologies to mitigate any negative environmental impact. 
These activities have resulted in a significant reduction 
in the probability of risks associated with environmental pollution. 
The Company also monitors changes in environmental legislation 
in the countries where it operates.RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The risk management system covers risks 
of a social and environmental nature, 
among other areas. Detailed  information about the risk 
management system and a list of key 
risks faced by the Company are given 
in the Company's Annual Report 
for 2017

Management Service”We were pleasantly surprised by the Moscow Oil Refinery. 
Such purification technologies with such high efficiency 
have never existed before in Russian oil refining practices. 
We analyse the samples we took and can tentatively confirm 
all the attributes declared by the refinery”.The construction of the Biosphera treatment 
facilities was completed at the Moscow Oil 
Refinery in 2017. 
Numerous stakeholders visited the refinery 
to assess its current level of environmental 
safety: leaders from the Moscow government 
and the country’s environmental authorities 
as well as journalists from leading 
media outlets. Experts from the national 
environmental organization ‘Green Patrol’ paid 
two visits to the refinery. The specialists took 
samples of treated wastewater from the Moscow 
Oil Refinery both before and after the launch 
of the Biosphera facilities.‘Green Patrol’ at the Moscow Oil RefineryGAZPROM NEFT’S VALUES FORM THE BASIS FOR ITS CORPORATE 
CULTURE. THE FOCUSES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CORPORATE CULTURE 
ARE DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY’S STRATEGY AND THE CHALLENGES 
FACED BY THE OIL INDUSTRY. 
VALUES OF GAZPROM NEFT
Safety and a Green Focus. Our priority is the safety of people, the environment, 
and the Company’s property.
Integrity. We are open and honest with respect for one another, the Company, 
our partners, competitors, and the public. We practice what we preach.
Leadership.  We take initiative and strive to be the best in everything we do; 
we set ambitious goals and bear personal responsibility for the result.

and resources, and care about safety and augmentation.
Mutual respect and trust.  We respect ourselves and others, solve complex 
problems together, trust each other’s professionalism, and help our colleagues 
to achieve success.
One of the key feedback tools 
that the Company can use 
to assess how satisfied employees 
are with different aspects of their work 
and identify the Company’s strengths 
as an employer 
and areas for improvement is the social 
and psychological climate study. 
In 2017, 27,316 employees 
from 54 subsidiaries took part 
in the study. In addition, some 
2,500 employees took part in focus 
groups and 249 managers were 
interviewed.
A new format of the report was 
prepared as part of the study 
to provide an opportunity to analyse 
data on various indicators of target 
audiences throughout the Company, 
a subsidiary, or unit. An additional 
analysis of data was conducted 
on professional burnout, groups of employees were identified, 
and recommendations on ways 
to prevent this phenomenon were 
generated.
The level of involvement of employees 
increased by 2 percentage points 
compared with 2016 and amounted 
to 74%.
Key drivers of involvement:
trust in top management
commitment to the Company
a high level of awareness

The Company develops an external communications system that aims to build 
a dialogue with outside audiences, inform stakeholders about significant events 
in the Company’s activities, foster the reputation of Gazprom Neft, and promote its 
brand.
In 2017, the Company developed a long-term communications strategy

websites, which are united into a single integrated system, Gazprom Neft 
communities, Gazpromneft filling station networks, and the ‘Native Towns’ social 
investment programmes in the social networks Facebook, VKontakte, YouTube,

the overall strategy of Gazprom Neft 
and aims to achieve the Company’s key 
goals by providing it with the required 
number of skilled and motivated 
employees in the present and the future. 
In order to meet the Company’s needs 
for skilled specialists in the regions 
where it operates, Gazprom Neft 
develops incentive and social 
support programmes for its staff, 
provides training and development 
for employees, and creates a talent 
pool.
Since 2016, Gazprom Neft 
has been implementing 
the ‘Rotation of production staff 
and process improvement’ initiative 
as part of which employees have 
the opportunity to develop in new 
areas at the Company. Gazprom Neft 
works with higher and specialized 
secondary educational institutions to create training programmes 
and specialized departments based 
on the Company’s needs, including 
to train specialists in rare professions 
(as part of the programmes 
‘Development of offshore oil and gas 
fields’, ‘Geological fundamentals 
for modelling fields with hard-
to-recover hydrocarbon reserves 
and the assessment of geological 
reserves’, and ‘Chemical reagents 
and hydraulic fracturing technologies’, 
among others).

the corporate culture, and improving 
operational activities. 
The departments and faculties 
are structured according to functional 
attributes and cover virtually 
all of the Company’s activities. 
Each department consists 
of a community of internal trainers 
and experts working in one 
or more related functions and serves 
as a tool for identifying, preserving, 
and disseminating the knowledge 
required to solve production problems. 
The faculties work according 
to a competency-based approach – 
each faculty training programme is tied 
to a specific professional or managerial competency. The competency-based 
approach enables the faculty to plan 
training in accordance with actual 
functional needs, which are determined 
during the evaluation of employees. 
The evaluation is carried out annually 
and serves as a reference point when 
compiling the targeted programme 
for staff development.
The University’s portal launched 
in 2017 serves as its technological 
platform. Using the portal, employees 
can search for and obtain knowledge, 
pass e-courses, and communicate 
with colleagues and experts. 
A total of 85,000 courses were 
taken on the portal over the course 
of the year, pilot courses were 
conducted using augmented reality 
technologies, mobile and apps were put 
into operation. CORPORATE UNIVERSITY

The Corporate University went through 
a period of intensive development 
in 2017, increased the scope 
and quality of training, and gained 
recognition from the external expert 
community.
The university has a model that 
is unique for the corporate training

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017The Regional Sales Directorate 
manages a chain motor fuel sales 
outlets in Russia, the CIS, and Eastern 
Europe. The petrol stations employ 
roughly 20,000 employees. They 
are trained at a licensed training 
centre that includes classroom 
training and mobile training as part 
of which a specially equipped training 
vehicle travels to remote gas stations 
and conducts practical training 
and an assessment of the professional skills of employees. All training centres 
have been equipped with mobile 
devices for online training since 2016.
Filling station employees 
annually undergo an assessment 
of their professional skills after which 
the employees who demonstrate 
the best results take part 
in a professional skills competition. 
Some 5,000 specialists took part 
in the competition in 2017.The Directorate also organizes 
the ‘Battle of Merchants’ professional 
skills competition, which was held 
in a hackathon format in 2017 
and enabled participants to fine tune 
their skills in the establishment 
of start-ups. The competition resulted 
in the creation of 8 digital products that 
solved real business problems.The first specialized Gazpromneft-
Class took place at Lyceum No. 82 
in St. Petersburg during the reporting 
year. In addition to the core programme 
with an in-depth study of natural 
sciences, students studied specialized 
subjects, such as the fundamentals 
of geology and materials 
science, mathematical modelling 
in the oil industry, applied physics, 
time management, and the theory 
of inventive problem-solving. Students 
worked with case studies that develop 
creative and research potential.
Gazpromneft-Class joined 
the ‘Gazprom Class’ programme 
in 2017, which enabled students 
to take part in projects managed 
by the Gazprom Group. One such 
project was a powwow of ‘Gazprom

programme included scientific, 
educational, sports, cultural, excursion, 
and team-building blocks.

Head of the Staff Training and Development Department 
in the Regional Sales Directorate”The Lecture Hall Project is essentially an actual 
start-up, which over five months has transformed 
from an idea with minimal efforts and funds 
to the most popular new training format. 
Employees from all Gazprom Neft units took 
part in it".In 2017, the Regional Sales Directorate and the Corporate 
University launched the Lecture Hall educational 
project,  which consists of a platform that addresses 
topics that are important for business and are determined 
by the employees themselves. Lecture Hall speakers 
include specially invited external and internal experts. 
The seven lectures held last year were attended 
by 1,400 Company employees, while another more than 
7,000 employees watched video lectures on the in-house 
portal. Corporate Lecture HallREGIONAL SALES DIRECTORATEEDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT FORUM
In December, the Company hosted 
the Education Environment 
Forum, which brought 
together more than 
200 managers and employees 
from the Corporate Centre 
and its subsidiaries. The forum 
focused on digitalization and was 
divided into five areas of key 
competencies of the future – 
‘Digital’, ‘Relationships’, 
‘Creativity’, ‘Collaboration’, 
and ‘Personal Efficiency’, 
with lectures and master classes 
held on each theme. The Forum 
was attended by more than 
20 heads of corporate universities 
of major Russian companies.The Company launched a targeted modular training programme titled ‘Managing 
Partnerships’, which was developed based on orders from an internal client 
and focuses on executives who are responsible for working with strategic 
partnerships/joint ventures. The importance of this task is associated 
with a powerful trend – joint work by major market players on complex projects. 
This form of business organization and interaction with other companies requires 
the creation of new key competencies and the systematization of processes. 
The ‘Managing Partnerships’ programme is a solution to this problem. Each 
of the programme’s modules corresponds to the stages of the partnership’s life 
cycle and the theory is linked to team-based project work on real challenges, which 
makes it possible to identify the problematic issues in corporate processes related 
to partnerships and to develop practical approaches to eliminating them.
The Managerial and Corporate Competencies Faculty launched a project during 
the reporting year for individual development tracks. As part of the project, 
an employee can independently develop a competency he/she chooses by solving 
production tasks and studying developmental materials. Some 600 employees 
from the Company took part in the pilot project.

CONSERVATION
The lives and health of employees are a key 
priority for Gazprom Neft. The Company’s strategy 
in industrial, environmental, and occupational safety 
is guided by the ‘Goal – Zero: No Harm to People, 
the Environment, or Property When Performing 
Work’. Gazprom Neft is committed to becoming 
one of the world’s leading oil and gas companies 
in this regard. The safety management system 
is integrated with the Company’s 
operational management system 
(OMS). In 2017, Gazprom Neft launched 
the joint OISMS Committee, which 
includes members of the Management 
Board, directors of production 
units, and department heads. 
Industrial safety, occupational safety, 
and civil defence committees were 
also established in each division 
and at subsidiaries. 
When developing industrial 
and occupational safety 
programmes, Gazprom Neft relies 
on an occupational safety risk map. 
The list of such risks is regularly 
updated. The Company uses advanced 
international methods to assess 
man-made risks. The goal of such 
methods is to ensure employees do 
not start work if they are not confident 
that it can be safely performed. 
To minimize safety risks, Gazprom 
Neft is introducing effective methods 
of production control and is developing 
a safety culture.APPROACHES

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017As part of the ‘Goal – Zero’ programme, 
a number of the Company’s managers 
have become leaders in initiatives 
that aim to minimize the number 
of accidents. Such initiatives include 
‘Risk assessment training for staff’, 
‘Water transport’, ‘Railway transport 
safety’, and ‘Operation of existing 
facilities’", among others. Each 
of these initiatives encompasses 
one of the specific areas in which 
the leader and the team that the leader 
has assembled are developing 
and implementing various projects 
to improve safety. These projects include safety audits 
in a specific area, identifying areas 
for improvement, and developing action 
plans using best practices.
An industrial safety training 
system based on the requirements 
of the legislation of the Russian 
Federation, corporate standards,

by the corporate standard: ‘Procedure 
for managing and organizing interaction 
with contractors on industrial safety 
issues’, which was updated in 2017.

Neft’s requirements for contractors 
during the stages of selecting 
the contractor as well as managing 
and analysing the effectiveness of its 
work. The compliance of contractors 
with legislative and corporate 
requirements concerning industrial 
safety is recorded in contracts.
The ‘Steps’ corporate programme 
for work with contractors allows 
for monitoring the fulfilment 
by contractors of industrial safety 
requirements and consistently 
improving the level of safety culture 
at contractor organizations.
Gazprom Neft works closely 
with contractors on matters concerning 
industrial safety during all stages 
of cooperation.Contractors are part of the corporate 
training system on industrial safety: 
Gazprom Neft organizes regular 
specialized forums and meetings 
with contractors to exchange 
experience and improve efficiency. 
The Company is developing 
the practice of top-level supervision 
of contractors by Gazprom Neft 
managers. In 2017, representatives 
of contractors underwent roughly 
12,000 courses in occupational safety 
and 61,000 courses as part of cascading 
communications on basic safety rules.
The Company is developing 
programmes to provide financial 
and non-financial incentives 
to contractors for proactive measures 
to enhance the industrial safety 
culture. Starting in 2016, Gazprom 
Neft has introduced a rating system 
as part of the ‘Steps’ programme 
for contractors in matters concerning 
industrial safety. The system aims 
to increase the level of motivation 
and involvement among contractors 
and effective interaction between 
the parties. In 2017, the rating’s key 
performance indicator for industrial 
safety grew to 40%. SAFETY

The Company has developed 
the first samples of improved 
work wear for offshore 
projects. Antistatic materials 
with an enhanced fire resistance 
rating that can protect a person 
against heat and flame were used 
to manufacture the work wear. 
The work wear is appropriate 
for complex offshore working 
conditions and industrial safety 
requirements. The checklist includes 
an extensive list of basic 
workplace safety principles. 
It is a simple and understandable 
tool through which an employee 
or a contractor’s representative 
can conduct a risk assessment 
before starting and when 
performing work. The checklist 
does not require any special 
training and is available to all 
employees.
The contents of the checklist 
will be updated in accordance 
with the evolving requirements 
for the high-tech construction 
of the Company's facilities.“A FOUNDATION OF SAFETY”
A new tool for monitoring

Division – a checklist for the safe 
performance of work that 
is drawn up based on a factor 
analysis of occupational injuries.
The number of accidents involving equipment (incidents) decreased by 8.5% in 2017. 
To the Company’s deepest regret, fatal accidents were not eliminated entirely, 
but their number decreased from three to one. The Company is doing everything 
possible to prevent tragedies from repeating. A special commission was created 
to investigate the fatal incident and it conducted a detailed analysis, identified 
its causes, and took action to minimize the risk of such an incident reoccurring. 
The results of the investigation were considered at a meeting of the OISMS

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017READINESS TO RESPOND 
TO EMERGENCIESFIRE AND TRANSPORT 
SAFETY
In an effort to ensure civil defence, the Company is improving the sustainability 
of its production facilities when emergencies arise and training employees 
in actions to take in the event of emergencies, including work in challenging climatic 
conditions. 
The Company conducted 370 civil defence and emergency situation exercises 
in 2017 (a 14% increase from 2016) while devoting special attention to: 
assessing the reality of current action plans to prevent and respond 
to emergencies and eliminate oil and petroleum product spills
organizing interaction in emergency response
implementing priority measures to support and evacuate staff
The themes of the exercises and training were determined in accordance 
with the specific nature of production activities in the region.The Gazprom Neft transport 
safety programmes include 
production control, safe driving 
training, on-the-job training 
and instructions on safety issues, 
and monthly ‘Stopwatches’, or meetings 
on industrial safety issues.The 
Company employs project teams whose 
job is to improve safety in priority 
focuses for Gazprom Neft such 
as air, water, and motor transport. 
A development roadmap through 
the end of 2019 has been created 
for each focus.The Company began introducing 
the updated ‘Traffic Safety Control 
System’ standard during the reporting 
year. Drivers working for Gazprom Neft 
and contractors underwent training 
on the requirements of the standard 
as well as defensive/winter driving. 
In 2017, the number of major traffic 
accidents decreased by 54%, 
significant accidents declined by 20%, 
the accident rate plummeted by 88%, 
and the number of fires edged down 
by 8%.
An automated fire extinguishing system was introduced at the drilling sites 
of the Kuyumba field in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. 
Drilling operations at Kuyumba have an extremely fire hazard due 
to the use of oil-based drilling mud that exits the well at temperatures 
of up to 60 degrees. An automated system was introduced to eliminate 
the human role of assessing the risk of fire and its suppression: residential 
and industrial premises were equipped with sound and light alarms 
from which signals are transmitted wirelessly, the drilling equipment 
is equipped with automatic fire extinguishing modules (powder and foam 
generators), and SMS notifications are sent out when the system is triggered. 
Uninterruptible power supplies ensure the system can function for 24 hours 
after a power outage. IT technologies for extinguishing fires
Gazpromneft-Logistics introduced virtual simulators are introduced 
on which employees simulate actions in the event of emergency situations 
at petroleum product loading and unloading platforms.
During the training, employees respond to a simulated emergency situation 
by choosing a particular sequence of actions. The simulator is totally 
immersive. In the event of a mistake or sequence error, trainees will see 
a simulation of the accident that occurred. If they take the correct actions, 
they successfully pass the training and get a better idea of the actions to take 
in a stressful situation. Virtual reality The exercises aimed to improve 
the level of preparation 
for the clean-up of an oil spill 
over an area of 5,000 m3 near 
the Prirazlomnaya platform.

During the exercises, 
the participants went 
over the scenario for an oil spill 
as a result of a tanker collision 
with the support vessel 
and ensured the protection 
of the coastal strip of Varandey 
village from an oil spill in icy 
conditions.

and manages the quantitative 
determination of the volume 
of greenhouse gas emissions. The Company is developing risk 
management system associated 
with hydrocarbon regulation and also 
assesses and monitors greenhouse gas 
emissions generated by its operations. 
Emissions are assessed based 
on the following aspects:
direct greenhouse gas emissions 
related to the flaring of hydrocarbon 
fuel and substances, the operation 
of production facilities, and process 
losses indirect energy emissions related 
to the consumption of third-party 
electricity, heat, steam, or cooling
Gazprom Neft is developing 
a programme to increase the use 
of associated petroleum gas use at all 
its production assets. The Company’s 
key goal is to increase the level of APG 
utilization to 77.7% in 2018, 90.2% 
in 2019, and 95% by 2020. The Company

1 — The withdrawal of water from surface sources has increased due to heightened requirements for reservoir pressure maintenance systems.
2 — The decrease in the use of recycled water is due to a stoppage in the first process flow at the Omsk Oil Refinery for repairs and the reconstruction of process units (consumers 
of recycled water).Sergey Sobyanin
Moscow Mayor“The Moscow Oil Refinery is implementing an ambitious programme, 
which should result in a roughly 75% reduction in the enterprise’s 
environmental impact. With the introduction of treatment facilities, 
the refinery will reduce the intake of water from the Moskva River 
by 60% due to the recycling of treated waters within a closed cycle. 
This is good news for all residents of the capital and the suburbs”. When using water resources, 
Gazprom Neft seeks to reduce 
water consumption and discharges 
in wastewater as well as improve 
the environmental attributes of water 
bodies and their coastal areas. 
The Company regularly monitors water 
protection zones as well as surface 
water, groundwater, and wastewater 
and assesses the bottom sediment 
conditions of surface water bodies 
in the areas where it operates. 
Scientists from the Polar Research 
Institute of Marine Fisheries 
and Oceanography are carrying 
out comprehensive studies 
of the water environment as well as key 
hydrological and hydro-chemical 
indicators of the water condition near 
the Prirazlomnaya offshore platform.
Key water resource conservation 
projects in 2017 included two major 
projects implemented by the Company 
as part of the Year of Ecology federal 
action plan in Russia: the completion 
of construction on the ‘Biosphera’ 
treatment plants at the Moscow Oil 
Refinery and the start of construction 
on similar facilities at the Omsk Oil 
Refinery. Investment in the treatment 
facilities at the Moscow Oil 
Refinery amounted to RUB 9 billion. 
The complex consists of a multi-stage 
wastewater treatment system that The efficiency index of the multistage water treatment 
system at the refinery exceeds 99.9%. 
During the first stage, water passes through 
a pressure flotation unit, where an air flow knocks 
out mechanical impurities and petroleum products. 
Then the water passes into the membrane bioreactor 
where the wastewater is mixed with silt, which contains 
microorganisms that are specially grown for Biosphera 
and are capable of absorbing and processing 
residual petroleum products. After it does its job, 
the silt is filtered by membranes whose pore diameter 
is smaller than that of human hair. In the final stage, 
the purified water passes under pressure through 200 
tonnes of activated carbon and 1,440 reverse osmosis 
membranes in which the size of the cells does not exceed 
that of a water molecule. The purified water then 
is put back into production and the filtered petroleum Biosphera at the Moscow Oil Refinery
Alexander Kuznetsov
Associate Professor in the Biotechnology Department 
at Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology”Purification using a membrane bioreactor is more expensive than other options, 
but this is the only technology that is promising for domestic and industrial 
wastewater, especially in urban conditions. There are only a few examples 
of this technology being used in Russia. In oil refining it is quite unique”.products are used for refining. Some of the purified water 
is transmitted directly by pipes to the municipal sewage 
treatment facilities. The refinery has no open sewage 
to the Moskva River. 
In 2017, experts from the Green Patrol national public 
organization presented the Moscow Oil Refinery 
with a certificate recognizing the quality of the sewage 
treatment system’s modernization – ‘Green Certificate 
– Modernization Carried Out’. The decision was made 
based on an analysis of samples that environmentalists 
selected before and after the launch of the innovative 
Biosphera treatment facilities.
The Biosphera project was among the winners 
of the annual Ecoworld 2017 International Ecological 
Award in the category ‘Environmental Developments, 
Resource Conservation, and Non-Waste Technologies’.2013 2014 2015 2016 2017

The technological solutions drastically 
reduce the total area of the treatment facilities, make them more compact, 
and ensure the technological stages 
of water treatment are hermetically 
sealed. 
The Omsk Oil Refinery has begun 
reorganizing the recycling water 
supply system in order to meet the production needs of some 
of the units. Local water units will 
ensure the uninterrupted operation 
of base oil production and will also 
increase the reliability of technological 
processes, as the water 
recycling systems will be split up 
and decentralized.

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017Gazprom Neft is developing 
an industrial waste management 
system that aims to optimize waste 
flows, mitigate the environmental 
impact, reduce the economic cost 
of waste generation, and maximize 
the possible use of waste. 
In 2017, the subsidiaries 
of the Upstream Division introduced 
a concept for the utilization of drilling waste in order to mitigate 
environmental risks and unify 
waste management requirements. 
The concept takes into account 
the infrastructure of the fields 
under development, the existing 
technologies for neutralizing 
drilling waste, key performance 
indicators, well construction methods, 
and the injection of waste into 
the reser voir.

PROTECTION OF LAND RESOURCES AND VEGETATION
Gazprom Neft reclaims disturbed 
and contaminated land and sludge pits 
by introducing advanced technologies 
for pipeline monitoring and diagnostics 
and restoring soil taking into account 
the soil and climatic conditions 
of the regions. 
As part of the ‘Clean Territory’ project, 
the Company conducts diagnostics 
and monitors corrosion in an effort 
to reduce pipeline failure rates 
and the area of contaminated land. 
One of the focuses of the project 
is the reclamation of polluted 
“historical heritage” land.Gazprom Neft and Tyumen State University launched cooperation in conducting 
chemical and analytical quality control of the environmental restoration work being 
carried out by Gazprom Neft. Independent laboratories at Tyumen State University 
will analyse soil samples in reclaimed areas of oil contaminated lands, drilling 
waste, oily waste, and products generated from their utilization. Independent 
control is a proactive measure that allows for promptly identifying and correcting 
deviations when performing environmental restoration work.
In 2017, the Company continued to replicate the ‘Green Seismics’ technology at its 
enterprises, which saves trees from being cutting down during seismic operations. 
The conventional approach requires creating wide clearings that are needed 
for heavy all-terrain vehicles to pass through. Thanks to cable-free recording 
equipment, which can be installed using light technology, ‘Green Seismics’ allows 
for significantly narrowing the clearings or not making them at all. The technology 
is already being utilized at Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegaz, Gazpromneft-Khantos, 
Slavneft-Megionneftegaz, and Gazpromneft-Vostok.
PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY
Gazprom Neft is implementing 
a perpetual corporate programme 
to preserve biodiversity based 
on a list of flora and fauna that serve 
as indicators of the stable condition 
of the marine ecosystems in Russia’s 
Arctic zone. The programme was 
developed by the Company jointly 
with leading scientific research 
institutes, Russian Arctic National 
Park, and the Marine Mammal 
Council taking into recommendations 
from the UN Development Programme, 
the Global Environment Facility, 
the Ministry of Natural Resources 
and Environment, and the World 
Wildlife Fund in Russia.The Company carries out 
environmental monitoring of its impact 
on the Arctic ecosystems in the area 
of its operations. Studies conducted 
in 2017, including toxicological 
and genetic analyses of biological 
samples, did not reveal any significant 
changes. 
Starting in 2017, the Company 
introduced action programmes 
to preserve biodiversity 
for all its assets located in Russia. 
The implementation of these 
programmes will be continued in full 
in 2018.A programme to reproduce aquatic 
biological resources is a key component 
of the Company's field development 
projects.
The Company’s enterprises released 
36 million valuable young fry into 
reservoirs during the reporting year 
as part of the programme to reproduce 
aquatic biological resources.

methods of reclamation 
revealed it was possible 
to accelerate the adaptation 
and purification of soils. 
Based on the testing results, 
the technology will be introduced 
at the Company’s facilities.WASTE MANAGEMENT
The Omsk Lubricants 
Plant has opened a site 
to store oil sludge. It will help 
to minimize the risks of soil 
contamination at the production 
site and ensure compliance 
with legal requirements 
for the accumulation of oily 
waste.In 2017, the subsidiaries 
of the Upstream Division 
introduced a concept 
for the utilization of drilling

Chief Engineer and First Deputy CEO 
of Gazpromneft-Yamal“In the future, the company will be able to provide 
power to facilities that are located dozens 
of kilometres from main networks. Moreover, 
the introduction of a wind-solar power plant 
is entirely safe for the Arctic environment”.In 2017, Gazpromneft-Yamal launched the pilot testing 
of the YURTA combined wind-solar power plant 
with capacity of 47.5 kW, which is designed to supply 
power to a group of line-to-line consumers.  
The hybrid technology will significantly reduce the cost 
of power supplies to long-distance and remote sites 
from network infrastructure facilities due to the lack 
of a need to build power lines.
The Russian-produced equipment for the power plant 
is designed to operate at temperatures as low as -60°C. 
The vertical shape of the wind generators makes 
it possible to generate electricity regardless of which way 
air is blowing.New technologies in the Arctic

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017In 2017, the enterprises of the Downstream Division continued implementing 
the activities of the integrated Energy Conservation and Improved Energy Efficiency 
Programme. Gazpromneft-Aero and Gazpromneft-BM have joined the programme, 
which as a result now includes the energy conservation activities of 49 production 
assets in the Downstream Division.
Main activities of the programme:
replacing and modernizing process furnaces to increase their efficiency 
optimizing the recuperation system and using secondary energy resources 
in technological processes 
increasing the efficiency of fuel use in process furnaces by utilizing modern 
technologies 
optimizing condensate collection and return systems 
optimizing the operation of compressor equipment 
increasing the efficiency of heat and steam supply systems 
modernizing lighting systems 
replacing turbo drives and steam pumps with electric drives
As a result, the savings of fuel and energy resources within the Division exceeded 
the targets and amounted to:
thermal energy – by 279,400 Gcal 
fuel – by 137,500 tonnes of natural fuel

Vladimir Andreyev
Head of the Energy Department 
of the Downstream Division“The results of the energy 
conservation programme 
are a kind of indicator 
of the success and coordination 
of the work performed by a large 
team of specialists. Our further 
work in this area is consistent 
with the main trends 
in the industry’s development 
and is based on the digitization 
of business processes 
with the active use 
of components of predictive 
analytics and progressive 
IT solutions and technologies”.MOSCOW OIL REFINERY IMPROVES 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
The biggest contribution 
to the reduction in fuel 
consumption came 
from the modernization 
of the technological furnaces 
of crude vacuum unit-6, 
which accounts for 19% 
of the refinery’s total energy 
consumption, and the completion 
of a project to switch the furnaces 
from liquid to eco-friendly gas 
fuel. The installation of modern 
energy-efficient equipment 
and the transfer of the entire 
refinery’s lighting system 
to energy-saving technologies 
also helped to conserve energy.The modernization and repair 
of key units at the Moscow 
Oil Refinery in 2017 reduced 
the refinery’s fuel consumption 
by 2.1% and thermal energy 
consumption by 0.9%.

1 — Calculated according to the methodology of the company Solomon. The Energy Intensity Index (EII) allows for a quantitative comparison of the energy efficiency of a specific oil refinery 
with another refinery that is similar in terms of production units and work conditions. The index shows the ratio of actual energy consumption versus the enterprise’s standard energy 
consumption. The smaller an enterprise’s EII value is, the better its energy efficiency level is.The implementation of measures contained in the integrated programme 
to improve the reliability of power supply to refineries has reduced the number 
of power failures at refineries by 15% compared with 2016.
In general, energy conservation activities made it possible to save 7.8 TJ 
of thermal energy, electricity, and fuel. The economic effect exceeded the targets 
and amounted to RUB 929.7 million.
The increase in specific energy consumption in 2017 is due to a decrease 
in refining volumes and the utilization rate of secondary processes in accordance 
with the production program as well as the reconstruction and commissioning 
of new units at the Moscow and Omsk Oil Refineries and the start of the production 
of Group III oils at Slavneft YANOS OJSC.
The Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency 
Programme combines energy-saving measures 
at 49 production assets of the Downstream Division.

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017Launch of the Bazhen project in KMAD-Yugra. In 2017, Gazprom Neft 
and the region’s government launched a project that was granted national 
status to build a facility that will use domestic technologies and high-tech 
equipment to develop the Bazhenov formation. The Bazhen Technological 
Centre will develop cost-efficient methods for the extraction of hard-to-recover 
oil reserves using the Company’s advanced technologies and competencies. 
The new technologies and equipment will be tested at the Palyanovskaya area 
of the Krasnoleninskoye field.
Signing of road maps with the governments of the Tomsk and Tyumen 
Regions to expand the use of high-technology products, including import-
substituting products, at organizations in the regions. The programmes aim 
to support Russian producers and facilitate the manufacturing of high-tech 
products. At the end of the year, the Company held meetings with regional 
suppliers and sent them updated strategies and road maps of Gazprom 
Neft PJSC for the import substitution of technologies and equipment. A total 
of 226 enterprises from the Tyumen Region and 93 enterprises from the Tomsk 
Region joined the pool of the Company’s suppliers. Six projects from residents 
of the Tyumen Technopark were selected and will undergo an assessment 
for their potential introduction at the Company's enterprises.Expanded cooperation with the Omsk Region government as part 
of a strategy to develop the region and its petrochemical cluster. In 2017, 
the Company continued to implement a national project in the region 
to develop the production of catalysts for secondary refining processes. 
A new enterprise – Gazpromneft-Catalytic Systems – was established 
for this purpose. As part of this new focus in the Omsk Region, design work 
began on a new catalyst production plant whose products and solutions 
will be in high demand among players in the Russian oil refining industry. 
The plant is scheduled to open in 2020. The Company also continued 
a modernization programme at the Omsk Refinery that aims to increase 
the depth of oil refining. 
Signing of agreements to expand the import substitution of lubricants 
and technical fluids at utility service and industrial enterprises 
with the governments of seven regions: the Bryansk, Sverdlovsk, Sakhalin, 
Tomsk, Tyumen, and Ulyanovsk Regions and Krasnodar Territory.
The Company engages in production activities 
in areas where indigenous peoples of northern 
Russian (IPNR) reside in the KMAD-Yugra and YNAD. 
Gazprom Neft takes special care to maintain a balance 
between the implementation of its strategic 
plans and the interests of indigenous people 
as well as to preserve their cultural heritage 
and the environment.
When exploring and developing fields, the Company strictly 
observes the rights of IPNR and engages in a dialogue 
with them. Gazprom Neft provides financial support 
to families and agricultural communities of indigenous 
peoples and works to preserve the national identity of these 
northern people, establish cultural ties between different 
communities and families, and draw public attention 
to the preservation of traditional arts and crafts.In order to establish a unified approach to interaction 
with indigenous peoples, Gazprom Neft in 2017 approved 
the Corporate Policy for Interaction with Indigenous Peoples 
of the North, Siberia, and the Far East* and a methodological 
document that describes the mechanisms and focuses 
for interaction with them.Interaction with indigenous peoples of northern RussiaNatalya Komarova
Governor of KMAD-Yugra“Together with Gazprom Neft, 
we are ready to turn a new page 
in the development of Russian 
technologies. It is essential 
that the new structure 
becomes a place for uniting 
the research and production

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017The Company has been implementing its Native Towns social investments 
programme to support regional development since 2013. The programme was 
drafted in accordance with the Company's development strategy and takes 
into account the social problems that people currently face in the regions 
where it operates. The Native Towns programme was initiated as a response 
to requests from local communities that were made during a large-scale audit that 
the Company conducted in 2012 to examine the effectiveness of its social activities 
and analyse the expectations of local residents. 
The main areas requiring further development that were identified as a result 
of the audit included:
closer interaction between the Company and local communities 
and the development of partnerships and tools to engage in social activism
the integration of a system for selecting and supporting projects 
with the business development strategy to achieve the Company’s sustainable 
development goals
the introduction of innovative tools to resolve urgent social problems 
and improve the quality of the urban environment and social services
a transition from responding to emerging socioeconomic problems to a system 
that aims to prevent them in order to improve the effectiveness of projectsSTRATEGY 
FOR SOCIAL 
ACTIVITIES
GAZPROM NEFT IMPLEMENTS ITS SOCIAL PROGRAMMES ON THE BASIS 
OF A SYSTEMATIC AND STRATEGIC APPROACH IN WHICH THE MAIN GOAL 
IS TO ENSURE THAT THE COMPANY’S INVESTMENTS HAVE A LONG-TERM 
SOCIAL AND BUSINESS IMPACT.
Based on these guidelines, 
Gazprom Neft has shifted 
from a “donor-based” 
model of social investment 
to a “partnership-based” model 
in which the key principle is to actively 
involve local communities in social 
activities and engage all stakeholders 
who are ready to take part in joint 
efforts to address the challenges 
of developing these territories. Thus, 
instead of being a sponsor, Gazprom 
Neft has become a driver of positive 
changes at the local level by providing 
active residents with tools, 
opportunities, and guidelines 
for development. To maximize its 
social impact, the Company actively 
involves external experts and NGOs 
in such cooperation.Forming communities
Projects must have public support to be 
a success. We are guided by the position 
of communities, the authorities, 
business, experts, and the media, 
and also engage activists and opinion 
leaders. Successful events are the ones 
that are organized together with citizens. 
We are not only working on implementing 
urban development ideas, but also 
joining existing projects and supporting 
the initiatives of local residents.Examining context
We use only verified data in our work. 
Regular surveys of local communities, 
sociological expeditions, and statistical 
analysis enable us to carry out 
the initiatives needed for a city or region. 
Our research results in specific 
recommendations for the development 
of territories that are not only used 
in our activities, but can also be useful 
in decision-making by regional and city 
administration officials.Thinking systematically 
For us, social investment 
is a professional activity for which 
we demand effectiveness. What sets 
us apart is a systematic approach 
and the desire to achieve measurable 
results. The key to the programme’s 
success is long-term strategic planning, 
a well-established reporting system, 
and constant monitoring of the progress 
of our initiatives. Our investments 
are productive.

aimed at systemic, innovative, and effective social reforms 
that are consistent with the key focuses of the ‘Native Towns 
programme. Public, charitable, and non-profit organizations 
along with state and municipal institutions can participate 
in such competitions, and groups of local residents 
have also had this opportunity since 2017. The winners 
of the competitions receive financial, methodological, 
and expert support from the Company.The Company analyses the results of past years 
and takes them into account when developing new projects.

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017The goal of the project is to provide new opportunities for the development of gifted youth 
from the regions (winners and medallists of the All-Russian Olympiads) at St. Petersburg State 
University as well as support students and young scientists who conduct research in applied 
and theoretical mathematics.The ‘Creative Practices’ programme, which is implemented jointly with the Creative Industries 
Support Fund, aims to study the creative environment of the Russian regions, including 
the regions in which the Company operates (predominantly Siberian regions), and to utilize 
the potential of young people in developing new sectors of the economy related to creativity 
and innovative activities. 
The project involves: 
researching the main problems and developmental focuses of the creative environment 
in a particular region
conducting educational programmes (open lectures, seminars, etc.) to train enterprising 
citizens on how to develop creative industries in their regions. The programme content 
is generated based on the needs of the residents as determined by survey results. 
The programme speakers include Russian and international experts in economics, urban 
studies, the media, and culture. The project is implemented in Omsk, Tyumen, Orenburg, 
Tomsk, Muravlenko, Khanty-Mansiysk, and Noyabrsk
Intensive educational courses on the development of the urban environment were held in 2017 
in Tyumen, St. Petersburg, Tomsk, Orenburg, and Noyabrsk. Gazprom Neft became a partner 
of the International Creative Industries Forum, which was held in Tyumen on 10-11 November 
2017. Calvert Forum Siberia, which was organized with the Company’s support, served 
as a platform for discussing the development prospects of the creative and entrepreneurial 
environment of Siberian cities, including cities in which Gazprom Neft operates.
Calvert Forum Siberia brought together 250 Russian and international experts: architects, 
urban studies specialists, entrepreneurs, government representatives, and educational 
and cultural institutions. The participants discussed the prospects of creative industries 
in cities of Siberia as a strategically significant territory with enormous human potential.
The conference kicked off the ‘Masters of Siberia’ project – an online platform that brought 
together the region’s best projects in various fields: from clothing design to IT projects 
and Siberian crafts. A highlight of the forum was the announcement of the ‘Masters of Siberia’ 
large-scale programme to support youth entrepreneurship in 2018. The project was presented 
by Chairman of the Board of the Centre for Strategic Research Alexey Kudrin and the Chairman 
of the Gazprom Neft Management Board Alexander Dyukov. The key goal of the project 
is to provide young entrepreneurs with access to the best Russian and international practices 
in strategic management, marketing, and the promotion of goods and services created 
by young entrepreneurs on the Russian and foreign markets.’MATHEMATICAL PROGRESSION’ ‘CREATIVE PRACTICES’
Stanislav Smirnov
Head of the Chebyshev Laboratory 
at St. Petersburg State University“Business support is an important part of the university system 
throughout the world. Thanks to Gazprom Neft's support, among 
other things, our laboratory has become one of the country’s key 
centres for the development of mathematical science and attracts 
young scientists and talented school graduates from all over 
the country. It is essential that leading business structures invest 
in science for Russia’s future”.
Alexey Kudrin
Chairman of the Board  
of the Centre for Strategic Research“Each year, more and more young specialists are getting involved 
in the new economy, where creativity and innovation take centre 
stage. The job of representatives of government, business, 
and culture is to contribute to this process with all they have. 
I am confident that the combination of professional research 
and practical steps in creative industries will provide an additional 
impetus to Russia’s economic development”.The prize winners are annually determined by a competitive commission of employees 
from Chebyshev Laboratory at St. Petersburg State University and corresponding members 
of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
In 2017, personalized scholarships and grants were awarded to 48 mathematics students 
at St. Petersburg State University and two young scientists for their achievements in research 
work. One of the scholarship recipients of the project was a laureate of the Clay Mathematics 
Institute who received the world’s second most significant award in mathematics. Eleven 
mathematics students received travel grants. The Gazprom Neft Scientific and Technical 
Centre, along with scientists from the Chebyshev Laboratory at St. Petersburg State University,

GAZPROM NEFT   І  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT   І  2017From 30 September to 9 October, St. Petersburg hosted ‘Strelka’ Week with Gazprom Neft’s 
support – an intensive educational course for residents on the theme of environmental reform. 
The overall goal of ‘Strelka’ Week was to build a dialogue between international experts, local 
specialists, and local residents and to search for opportunities that might not be overly obvious 
for tapping into the potential of St. Petersburg.
Lectures, workshops, and discussions on new approaches to studying and developing 
the urban environment were attended by more than 5,000 people. The speakers during 
‘Strelka’ Week included global experts on urban studies and new technologies. Attendees 
of a series of workshops supervised by experts from the Strelka Institute came up with five 
projects for the development of St. Petersburg’s Primorsky District.‘Stenograffia’ is an annual street art project that brings together leading Russian and foreign 
street artists. The aim of the project is to make a monochrome urban environment more 
friendly and creative using street art. The festival has the status of a major street art festival 
in Russia and is the only street art festival whose work extends beyond the Arctic Circle.‘STRELKA’ WEEK ‘STENOGRAFFIA’ STREET ART FESTIVAL
Olga Polishchuk
Executive Director 
of the Strelka Institute“We often talk about St. Petersburg’s legacy and past while saying almost 
nothing about its future. But we should talk about this and discuss 
the problem of the outflow of young specialists, who often leave after 
graduating from universities. How can the northern capital compete 
for human capital? The potential for the development of St. Petersburg 
is the main theme of ‘Strelka’ Week.Andrey Kolokolov
Art Director of the agency Streetart, 
a co-founder of the ‘Stenograffia’ Festival“‘Stenograffia’ gets more and more interesting each year. 
This year ‘mega-objects’ have been created in almost every region. 
A five-story postage stamp in Noyabrsk. A ‘Moskvich’ carved out 
of reality in Yekaterinburg. A new form is developing that gives 
an impetus to the development of the entire street art community. 
More and more people are joining ‘Stenograffia’, and we inspire 
them to fight for good. This is the main goal for us”.5,000

In 2017, the festival was held in Noyabrsk, Yekaterinburg, Khanty-Mansiysk, Omsk, the towns 
of Novy Port and Cape Kamennaya in the YNAD, Orenburg, and Muravlenko as well as Tomsk 
for the first time. ‘Stenograffia’ has developed substantively: without being limited to certain 
topics, artists are asked to create works that reflect the uniqueness of a particular region. 
The focuses of the ideas were based on fundamental research of problems that are relevant 
to each city. For northern regions (Noyabrsk, Cape Kamenny, Novy Port, and Khanty-
Mansiysk), a proposal was made to create drawings that are designed to “warm them up” 
and emphasize the warmth of human relations. Ideas for eastern territories (Ekaterinburg, 
Omsk, Orenburg, and Tomsk) were based on the unique features of these cities. In honour 
of the Year of Ecology, the theme ‘Visual Ecology. Thinking about the Future While Acting 
in the Present’ was proposed for all regions.
‘Stenograffia 2017’ provided cities with new unique street art: murals, 3D-drawings, exhibits, 
and even the first graffiti for the blind in Russia for which Braille was used. 9

tournament of the Kontinental Hockey League, one of the biggest children’s hockey tournaments 
in Europe, and Gazprom Neft’s key project in the development of children’s sports.
In 2017, teams from Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Finland competed 
in the tournament at arenas in Sochi and Omsk. The competitions were attended 
by 32,000 spectators. The Match TV channel is the general partner of the event, which was 
won by CSKA.Over its three years, the festival has transformed from a leisure event into to a space 
for the self-fulfilment of local residents. In 2017, the Native Town festival was held in Noyabrsk 
and Muravlenko in a new format of three thematic days: ‘City of Creativity’ (master classes 
and concerts with subcultural focuses), ‘City of Technology’ (informative family celebration), 
and ‘City of Science’ (popular science lectures). Science was the focus of festivals held during 
the reporting year: schoolchildren presented their research projects, scientific and educational 
platforms for experiments were organized at the event, and residents were able to take part 
in ‘What? Where? When?’ games.
In 2017, Gazprom Neft provided support for the ‘Where Art Is Born’ national festival held 
by the Yuri Rozum International Charitable Foundation. The festival has been supported 
by the Russian Ministry of Culture for more than 10 years. Events took place in Noyabrsk, 
Muravlenko and Khanty-Mansiysk. During the festival, well-known Russian musicians 
hosted creative meetings and master classes. In addition, the subject of support 
for musically gifted children and adolescents was discussed. The festival came to a close 
with a concert in each host city performed by students from local music institutions, along 
with their teachers and invited guests.GAZPROM NEFT CUP NATIVE TOWN URBAN FESTIVAL IN YAMAL

Gazprom Neft is a major investor 
in Serbia's economy and implements 
large-scale social projects 
in the country. In 2016-2017, 
as part of a programme to support 
humanitarian projects in the field 
of culture and to preserve Serbia's 
historical heritage, unique work 
was carried out to make a mosaic 
for the dome of the Church of St. Sava in Belgrade. Making the ornamentation 
for the dome was one of the most 
ambitious projects in the world in terms 
of decorating a curvilinear space: 
the total area of the mosaic covers 
1,248 square metres. The church 
is an architectural monument of Serbia 
and one of the largest Orthodox 
churches in the world. In addition, Gazprom Neft has been 
a partner of Serbia's largest classical 
music festival, the Bolshoi, since 2013. 
The festival is aimed at supporting 
young musicians from Serbia 
and Russia and developing social 
and cultural cooperation between 
the two countries.SERBIA
Emir Kusturica
Director, musician, festival founder"I try not to forget how I took my first steps in art. 
It wasn't easy. And here I am giving young people 
a chance to take their first steps. After this, they 
will be able to find opportunities and gain more 
confidence in themselves so as to go further."One of the most significant social projects carried out 
by the Company in Serbia is the Russian-Serbian Bolshoi 
Festival of Classical Music. 
Established by Serbian film director Emir Kusturica 
and Gazprom Neft, the festival is held every year 
in the Serbian village of Drvengrad in Mokra Gora National 
Park.
Among the 62 participants in 2017 were young musicians 
from Gazprom Neft's key regions of operations: St 
Petersburg, Tyumen, Omsk, Orenburg, Tomsk, Khanty-
Mansiysk and Muravlenko. For many of them, this was 
their first time at an international festival. Kusturica 
has created a unique atmosphere for creativity: 
this ethnographic village in the mountains has been 
transformed into a platform where young musicians can 
mingle with global stars. A number of famous Russian Bolshoi Festival
and Serbian musicians have performed in Drvengrad, 
including Denis Matsuev, Yuri Rozum, Nemanja Radulović 
and Alena Baeva. In 2017, Valery Gergiev, Artistic 
Director of the Mariinsky Theater, was an honoured guest
