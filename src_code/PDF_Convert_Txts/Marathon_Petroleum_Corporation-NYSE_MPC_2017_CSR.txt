Fellow employees, neighbors and shareholders,
This year marks Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s 130th 
year of providing the most affordable, reliable and plentiful 
energy the world has ever known. Our diversification into the natural gas business through our logistics partnership, MPLX LP, positions us well for a future in which the world’s need for energy continues to grow. Petroleum and natural gas are the energy sources that make modern life possible, and we are proud to play a prominent role in bringing them to the world.
Fossil fuels continue to propel mankind into a better future 
every day. The engine technologies that drive worldwide transportation and agriculture constantly become more efficient. Our nation’s enormous power-generation needs increasingly are met by affordable, domestic natural gas supplies, lowering the emissions of our power sector. And we are able to do our critical work of processing, manufacturing and transporting energy supplies with a smaller environmental footprint than ever before.
In fact, Marathon Petroleum’s refining system is among 
 
the most energy efficient in the nation. The Environmental 
Protection Agency has recognized U.S. refineries with 48 ENERGY STAR awards for energy efficiency and environmental compliance. We have earned 36 of those awards – more than all other refining companies combined. We also apply our energy efficiency approach to our transport trucks, inland marine fleet and other aspects of our operations.
Our manufacturing processes are cleaner and safer than 
ever. At the same time, as the world’s energy needs rise, alternative energy sources like wind and solar are often portrayed as virtually free of trade-offs. It’s fortunate, 
 
then, that the World Bank has studied the matter and pointed out in a report this year that wind, solar and 
 
other energy technologies routinely called “clean,” are actually “significantly MORE material intensive in their composition than current traditional fossil-fuel-based 
 
energy supply systems.”FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO
In fact, the report notes that under the Paris Climate Accord, which aims to keep global temperature rise to 
 
2 degrees Celsius, some metals required in “clean” energy systems will grow in demand by more than 1,000 percent, and global mining operations will have to grow accordingly.
This isn’t to say that the world 
shouldn’t take advantage of every energy technology available; clearly, we should. But reports like this annual Citizenship Report and our Perspectives on Climate-
Related Scenarios – published this year and available on our website – are critical to truly understanding the choices we’re making. Transparency about how we manage the risks in our business can 
bring society closer to making 
informed decisions about a 
future of abundant energy, a clean and safe environment, and prosperity for as much of mankind as possible.
Sincerely,
Gary R. Heminger
Chairman and CEO

Our values dictate how we approach our business 
decisions. Our board of directors and executive management recognize that our shareholders expect a solid return on their investment. But those who own MPC stock also share our expectation that we will earn profits honestly, inclusively, and while protecting the environment, our employees and contractors, and the communities where we operate.
HOW WE LIVE OUR VALUES
Our governance is transparent and promotes 
accountability. On our website we post our Corporate Governance Principles, bylaws, 
 
Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers,  
and various corporate governance policies, guidelines and procedures, among other governance-related documents. These 
 
documents provide a clear view of how we  
operate our business. They can be found here:  
http:/ /www.marathonpetroleum.com/Investor_Center/Corporate_Governance/
We also post our Code of Business Conduct, 
which members of our board, executive officers and salaried employees are required to read and adhere to. The code provides guidance for a variety of business situations, and multiple ways to report instances in which ethical, honest business practices may have been breached. Our code also makes explicit our requirement to respect the human, cultural and legal rights of individuals and communities and to promote, where we can and within the parameters of our business role, the goals and principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our acknowledgment of these principles is consistent with our dedication to enriching the workplace, 
preserving the environment, strengthening the 
communities where we operate and engaging 
 
with our stakeholders to pursue progress toward these goals.  
Our inaugural 
Perspectives on Climate-Related 
Scenarios report describes Board of Director 
oversight of risk management and the policies and 
procedures we use to ensure we are adhering to our core values. The publication can be found here:
 
http:/ /www.marathonpetroleum.com/About_MPC/Publications/
A key component to operating pursuant to our 
health, environmental, safety and security values 
 
is our commitment to obtain companywide RC14001
® certification, further described in this 
report on Page 8.
In this report, you’ll also see that we combined 
Diversity and Inclusion and Talent Management into a single organization; because we value diversity, we are integrating it into the way we find, recruit, retain and manage our talented employees. Similarly, we have spent billions of dollars on environmental stewardship and safety measures, which we describe in this report.

Since 2001, MPC’s health, environment, safety and 
security (HES&S) performance has been continually improving under the Responsible Care
® Management 
System, and we are now moving into a more rigorous phase of HES&S management that represents a new level of commitment: RC14001
® certification.
RC14001 is a management system that combines Responsible Care with the globally recognized ISO14001 environmental management system, established by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO, 
as the organization is called, is an independent, non-
governmental international body that provides world-class specifications for products, services and systems that ensure quality, safety and efficiency.
“RC14001 is a more detailed, prescriptive set 
of standards than the Responsible Care Management System, and after more than 15 years of continual improvement in our HES&S 
performance, we are now 
going to hold ourselves 
accountable to this higher standard companywide,” said Chairman 
 
and CEO  
Gary Heminger.
Four MPC 
organizations already certify to the RC14001 standard: the Detroit refinery; Terminal, Transport & MPC TAKES ITS HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY 
AND SECURITY COMMITMENT TO A NEW LEVEL
Rail; the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas; and 
Marathon Pipe Line LLC. The rest of the company will begin certitfying to the new standard in 2018.
Similar to Responsible Care, RC14001 provides the 
company a management system that integrates health, environmental stewardship, safety and security, and is third-party audited to ensure compliance and continual improvement.
“I couldn’t be more proud of what we have 
accomplished under Responsible Care,” said Heminger. “We are very well-positioned in our industry from an HES&S standpoint, and holding ourselves accountable to this higher standard will ensure we keep improving across all our operations.”

BY MORE THAN A CENTURY OF EXPERIENCE.
We conduct civil, environmental and 
archaeological surveys of proposed rights of way to ensure the proposed path of the pipeline is suitable. This information supports our permit applications with regulatory agencies.
During an extensive permit application process, 
our permits are reviewed by regulators, and we answer any questions they might have, or accompany them on field visits they might wish to make to verify the conditions we have outlined in our permit applications.
Some permit applications involve the 
opportunity for public comment. We support regulatory agencies by providing technical information they might need to respond to public comments.When we develop a pipeline, our planning phase takes into account the unique terrain, environmental and other characteristics of the path the pipeline will take, as well as the potential impacts it could have on landowners and the environment.
We discuss pipeline projects with regulatory agencies to make 
sure we understand any questions or concerns they might have.
We discuss the project with landowners whose properties might 
be affected by rights of way.

OUR HISTORIC PLANTATION  
BETTER REFLECTS THE LIVES  OF ENSLAVED PEOPLE
  Interpretive signage 
adds information 
about the experience 
of enslaved people 
in conducting the 
complex work of the 
plantation, including 
the planting, tending, 
harvesting and 
manufacture of sugar.
Until late last year, tourists who 
visited the MPC-owned San Francisco Plantation in Garyville, Louisiana,  could take part in a guided tour that provided scant information about the enslaved people whose forced labor made the plantation possible. Personnel at MPC’s Garyville refinery, where the plantation is located, began a research process in 2015 aimed at 
bringing greater prominence to the 
lives of those who helped build the nation’s economy of that era.
“The economic viability of plantations 
in the mid-1800s was based on an inhumane system of enslaved people, and when we present the history of 
the San Francisco Plantation, we need 
to acknowledge that,” said Tracy Case, 
general manager of the Garyville refinery. “We can’t focus only on the charming attributes of the plantation house and grounds; we should tell the 
whole story.”
The enhancements to the plantation 
tour experience were inaugurated in March 2017. On this page you can see some of the most prominent changes.

Jaime De La Cruz has a vision for diversity and  
inclusion that might surprise some people. “Diversity and inclusion is about everyone,” he says. “No matter your race, gender or gender identity, age, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation or any other aspect of who you are, the way we see diversity and inclusion encompasses all of us.”
De La Cruz, manager of MPC’s Diversity, Inclusion 
and Talent Management organization, newly created in 2016, says there’s a misconception that diversity and inclusion is only about race, sexual orientation, or other hot-button social issues. “While that’s part of it, by no means is that all,” he says. “What diversity and inclusion means, at its heart, is that every single one of us is incredibly valuable and has enormous 
potential; we wouldn’t be working at MPC if that 
weren’t the case.”
A wide variety of factors can make a group diverse, 
and this means the individuals would approach  their work differently. Inclusion principles mean  we recognize differences, appreciate them, and work with them to maximize everyone’s ability  to contribute.
“When we respect all differences – the obvious 
ones and the more subtle ones – and we practice inclusion, then we unlock everyone’s potential and really start to see positive results for the business,” De La Cruz says.WE HAVE INTEGRATED DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION 
INTO OUR RECRUITING, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
Those positive results come from a basic human 
trait: when people feel valued, they contribute more. “It’s not speculation – it’s fact – that when everyone is engaged, everyone contributes,” he says. “When everyone feels comfortable, they feel more free to share good ideas and challenge things that could harm our performance, like unsafe practices or inefficient processes and procedures.”
These benefits of diversity and inclusion, in fact, 
prompted MPC to integrate it into the way we find, recruit, retain and manage our talent. “We feel that Talent Acquisition and Organizational Development are the natural homes for our diversity and inclusion efforts,” says De La Cruz. “These are the functions where we are positioned best to unlock everyone’s 
potential from the time they’re recruited, through 
their hiring process, and into their development as professionals at our company.”| MPC | 2017 CITIZENSHIP REPORT      19

When we say environmental stewardship, health 
and safety are corporate values, we aren’t making a vague promise; we’re making a long-term commitment. Over the past decade, we have spent billions of dollars on this commitment, and in 2016 alone, we invested $732 million in capital expenditures, operations and maintenance, and remediation related to health, environment and safety. Just a few examples:
»  Refinery flares: As part of the EPA’s refinery 
flare enforcement initiative, we collaborated 
with the EPA to define operating parameters that ensure flare combustion efficiency. We were the first company to produce and publish 
the results of our own flare performance tests, 
and  we have made significant investments in flare improvements throughout our refining system. By the end of 2016, these investments had resulted in an 87 percent reduction in emissions of volatile organic compounds, an 85 percent drop in hazardous air pollutants, and a 51 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2007 levels. By the end of 2018, we will have invested more than $375 million in this program.
»  Tier 3 fuels: The EPA’s “Tier 3 Fuels Program” 
requires refiners to further reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline. We are investing in technologies throughout our refining system  to comply with this rule.
»  Energy efficiency programs: MPC is one of 
the most efficient refiners in the nation. Our refineries have earned more ENERGY STAR
® 
recognitions from the EPA than all other refiners in the U.S. combined.WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HEALTH, 
ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY
»  Galveston Bay wastewater treatment plant: 
We are making investments at our Galveston Bay refinery’s wastewater treatment plant that will reduce volatile organic compound emissions by approximately 100 tons per year.
»  Galveston Bay heater replacements: We  
are replacing old heaters with new ones equipped with state-of-the-art emissions controls to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions  by over 370 tons per year.
»  Galveston Bay thermal desorption unit: 
We’re investing in this technology that heats hazardous material to remove hydrocarbons. This enables us to reduce the volume of waste produced and transform hazardous material  
to a non-hazardous substance.
»  Process safety improvements: We continually 
invest in process safety, which helps further protect our people, environment and communities. We have made recent investments in tank and vessel relief and 
instrumented systems, as well as upgrades  
for compressor protection, to further reduce the risk of a release.
»  Detroit wastewater re-use: Our refinery  in Detroit is piloting a system that recycles 300 gallons of wastewater per minute. This program may be expanded to recycle larger volumes, depending on the results of the  
pilot program.

A few years ago, the Oakwood Heights 
neighborhood in Detroit was a blighted residential area. Many of the homes were abandoned, making them targets for squatters, arsonists and other criminal activity. And so, when our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project moved the refinery’s footprint closer to the neighborhood, we offered buyouts to the several hundred homeowners in the area. More than 80 percent chose to take the offer.
After hundreds of demolitions and a tremendous 
amount of effort and investment by the refinery  and its staff, most of Oakwood Heights is now  well-maintained lawn and trees. Refinery Environmental Professional Treva Formby is implementing the refinery’s vision for 18 acres  of the former neighborhood to be converted to a 
habitat certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council.  
“We plan to develop a 12-acre forest bordered by 
five acres of prairie and an acre of new wetland,”  
she said. “And this is part of a larger, longer-
range vision for a green space called Marathon 
Gardens, encompassing about 100 acres and 
including wildlife habitat restoration, park-like 
areas and urban farming.”
WE’RE BUILDING A CERTIFIED WILDLIFE HABITAT IN DETROIT
Thanks to the tireless efforts 
of volunteers from the refinery 
and the community, the Wildlife 
Habitat Council certified about 
a quarter acre of the former 
Oakwood Heights neighborhood 
last fall. In order to achieve the 
certification, volunteers from the 
refinery and community got  
together to plant trees, shrubs and 
grasses; weed the area to keep out 
invasive species; and  
keep the area litter-free.
The long-term  
vision for the former 
Oakwood Heights 
neighborhood is  
100 acres of  
urban farming,  
wildlife habitat and  
park-like areas.24      | MPC | 2017 CITIZENSHIP REPORT| MPC | 2017 CITIZENSHIP REPORT      27

employee  
survey
results  28      | MPC | 2017 CITIZENSHIP REPORT
Every two years, we commission a companywide 
survey of employees. The 2016 survey consisted of two parts: employee engagement, which was provided by Sirota Consulting; and a health, environment, safety and security (HES&S) section provided by Safety Performance Solutions.
The 2016 survey measured employee engagement 
across several corporate dimensions that are important to our business success, as well as perceptions of our HES&S situation.
A favorable score of 80 percent or higher is 
considered a strength, 65 to 79 percent is moderate, and below 65 percent is an opportunity to improve.
OUR GREATEST STRENGTHS:
Of the 93 questions on the combined surveys, 78 
scored an 80 percent or above (that’s up from 67 questions scoring 80 percent or above in 2014). Our employees also scored 39 questions at 90 percent 
favorable or higher, an improvement over the 30 
questions at that level in 2014. Among our greatest strengths:
 		Employees firmly believe MPC promotes a workplace characterized by safety and environmental stewardship.
 		A large majority of employees give their supervisors high marks when it comes to  health and safety, clearly setting expectations and modeling safe behavior.
 		Employees feel they have received adequate safety and environmental training to do  their jobs.
 		Nearly everyone believes that production  is not put ahead of safety, and that their supervisor would support them stopping  a job for safety reasons.OUR EMPLOYEES ARE ENGAGED AND  
SEE MPC IN A FAVORABLE LIGHT
 		About 90 
percent of employees are proud to work for MPC and would recommend the company as a  place to work.
Sixty-four percent of employees believe that “The promotion process selects employees with the  ability and motivation to work safely.” That was our lowest-scoring question, and an issue we are 
focusing on for improvement.
HOW WE COMPARE TO OTHERS IN OUR 
INDUSTRY
		Belief that management is more concerned about keeping people safe than with keeping the injury statistics low: 29 percent higher than industry comparison groups
		Feeling that supervisors do not put production ahead of safety: 26 percent higher than industry comparison groups
		Belief that our safety reward/recognition programs encourage working safely and participating in safety activities: 24 percent higher than industry 
comparison groups
		Feeling that discipline for safety violations is fair and consistent:  25 percent higher

HOW BIOFUELS WORK IN OUR  REFINING AND MARKETING SYSTEM
The U.S. government requires that fuel refiners and others blend biofuels into petroleum fuels. Those who are obligated 
to blend biofuels are call “obligated parties,” and to prove compliance with the law, obligated parties must turn in Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A RIN is generated whenever a gallon of biofuel is produced and sold. As an obligated party, Marathon Petroleum Corporation is required 
Whenever a gallon of qualifying biofuel is produced and sold, a RIN is generated. RINs prove compliance with the federal biofuels mandate.to present to the EPA enough RINs to show we complied with our Renewable Volume Obligation, which changes each year. This biofuels mandate and system is called the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Below is a basic representation of how the RFS works in our system.
* As an obligated party, MPC separates the RIN at a 
different point; we separate it when we receive the biofuel, rather than at the point of blending.
Most gasoline in the U.S. is 10 percent de-natured ethanol. Blends with up to 15 and 85 percent ethanol are also available, although many vehicles in the U.S. cannot run on these fuels.
At a terminal or loading rack, biofuel is blended into petroleum fuel. At this point, the RIN is “separated” from the biofuel, and the blender keeps the RIN.* The blender can either use the RIN to prove compliance with the RFS, or sell it to another obligated party that needs it.

We consider participation in the political process 
an important part of maintaining a strong refining and marketing industry in the U.S. It also helps us to continue meeting the energy needs of consumers at competitive prices, protect the investment of our shareholders, and be a good corporate citizen. That’s why we encourage employee involvement in the political process, including through the Marathon Petroleum Corporation Employees Political Action Committee (MPAC). MPAC is a 
voluntary organization that some employees 
are eligible to join. If they choose to join, they make contributions to MPAC, which then decides (through a board of directors) which political candidates should receive funding.
MPAC supports pro-business, pro-industry 
officeholders and candidates from both major political parties who support issues important to the company and our industry. MPAC assesses candidates based on a variety of criteria, including:
 
¢  Voting record or position on business and industry issues
 
¢  Leadership positions or key committee assignments
 
¢  Representation of a state or district where MPC has assets or employees
In addition, MPC uses employees’ voluntary MPAC contributions as an opportunity to support  charities throughout our operational areas: For every dollar employees contribute to MPAC, the company donates an equal amount to charities  of their choice.OUR EMPLOYEES ARE 
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND  ENGAGED IN PUBLIC POLICY
MPC employees participate in a hands-on 
educational event called “Inside Congress,” which provides insight into the many stakeholder pressures that lawmakers must balance as they adopt their positions, draft legislation, and decide what measures to support.

of taxpayer money, taxpayers take notice. So it’s only natural that when people hear the often-repeated assertion that profitable petroleum companies receive billions of dollars in subsidies, they wonder what’s going on.
But we have good news. Marathon Petroleum 
Corporation is profitable, and our petroleum operations aren’t subsidized by your tax dollars. In fact, quite the opposite. As we’ve reported in this publication for years, we  pay billions of dollars into federal, state and local treasuries. In 2016, we had about  $600 million in income tax expenses alone.  See Page 45 for more about our tax payments.
So how can anyone say we’re subsidized?
The trick is in how they define a “subsidy.” In 
addition to cash outlays of taxpayer money from the government, they also define subsidies as almost anything that reduces our taxes. If we apply this definition to a typical home-owning family with children, it would mean that if you have a mortgage, you receive subsidies because you deduct mortgage 
interest and it reduces your taxes. It would also 
mean you receive subsidies because each of your children represents a deduction on your tax return.YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD PETROLEUM COMPANIES 
RECEIVE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES. WE’D LIKE TO CLEAR UP A FEW THINGS.
The fact is, governments reduce taxes on 
activities they want to encourage. Below is a list of tax reductions MPC uses, none of which is a subsidy, under the common use  of the word:
 
¢ Domestic Manufacturer’s Section 199 Deduction
		 	¡ 	 Who is eligible for it: All taxpayers engaged 
in manufacturing, producing, growing or 
extraction in the U.S.
		 	¡ 	 Details:	While most industries are eligible 
for a deduction of 9 percent, the oil and  
gas industry is singled out and limited to  
a deduction of only 6 percent.
 ¢Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) Inventory Accounting
		 	¡ 	Who is eligible for it: All industries
		 	¡ 		Details: Under LIFO, the most recent 
inventory purchased is deemed to be 
used first. In times of rising prices, the 
LIFO accounting method results in better matching of costs and revenues. It has been a recognized means of valuing inventory under the U.S. tax code since 1939.
 ¢Federal Biodiesel Blender Tax Credit
		 	¡ 		Who is eligible for it:	A biodiesel blender 
that is registered with the IRS
		 	¡ 	 Details:	Amounts to $1 per gallon of pure 
biodiesel, agri-biodiesel, or renewable diesel 
blended with petroleum diesel to produce a 
mixture containing at least 0.1 percent diesel fuel. Only blenders that have produced and sold or used that qualified biodiesel mixture as a fuel in their trade or business are eligible for the tax credit. This credit expired Dec. 31, 2016.34      | MPC | 2017 CITIZENSHIP REPORT | MPC | 2017 CITIZENSHIP REPORT      35

	¢ Bonus Depreciation
		 	 ¡	Who is eligible: Any eligible taxpayer
		 	 ¡	 Details: Allows businesses to take an 
immediate 50 percent deduction on the 
purchase of eligible business property. This accelerated deduction is being 
phased out.
 ¢ Work Opportunity Tax Credit
		 	 ¡	Who is eligible: Any eligible taxpayer
		 	 ¡		Details:	Available to employers for 
hiring individuals from certain target groups who have consistently faced 
significant barrier to employment (such 
as unemployed veterans, food stamp recipients or ex-felons).
 ¢  Federal Empowerment Zone  
Employment Credit
		 	 ¡	Who is eligible:	Any eligible taxpayer
		 	 ¡	 Details: Available to employers that  
hire employees who live and work  
in an empowerment zone, which  
are designated distressed urban  
and rural areas. May be eligible  
for an employment credit of up  
to $3,000 per eligible employee  
through the end of 2016.
 ¢ Research & Experimentation Tax Credit
		 	 ¡	Who is eligible:	Any eligible taxpayer
		 	 ¡		Details: A general business tax credit  
for companies that incur certain  
defined research and development  
costs in the U.S.And one actual subsidy
Non-petroleum energy sources 
are generally subsidized by the U.S. and some state governments. MPC built a solar 
array several years ago that 
was eligible for a federal grant of $1.3 million and a grant from the state of Ohio of $1 million, which we received. However, the 
fact remains that our petroleum 
business is not subsidized.
To put that $2.3 million solar 
subsidy into perspective, the solar array cost us approximately $4 million to build and about $30,000 a year to maintain. We also have donated all of the 
power it generates to the city of 
Findlay, Ohio, which saved the city about $287,000 over a 
 
four-year period, including almost $97,000 in 2016 alone.36      | MPC | 2017 CITIZENSHIP REPORT

MPC’s business operations, like those of 
all American manufacturers, are subject to extensive regulation at both the federal and state levels through a wide variety of government agencies and programs.
A transparent framework of sound, sensible 
regulations is important to establish standards for safety, environmental protection and other societal expectations. In fact, since 1970, total U.S. emissions of the six common – or “criteria” – pollutants have decreased by more than 70 percent, as manufacturers and other businesses have worked to implement new technologies 
and comply with various federal, state and 
local regulations. This translates directly to ever-cleaner air and water for more people across the United States. And importantly, this tremendous progress has occurred while our nation’s economy and population have continued to grow.
Regulations also come with a cost – especially 
as those regulations become increasingly stringent and manufacturers strive to reduce the final remaining fractions of emissions from their operations. In fact, the National Association of Manufacturers found in a recent study that federal regulations now cost the American economy more than $2 trillion each year. These costs ultimately mean that American families pay higher prices for goods and services of all kinds. And unfortunately, an increasing number WE ADVOCATE FOR OUR INDUSTRY AND THOSE 
WHO USE OUR PRODUCTS
of regulations in recent years – particularly 
at the federal level – have raised significant questions about whether the associated costs outweigh any benefits that those regulations might provide.
As a result, many policymakers are striving for 
ways to achieve a better balance within our regulatory framework.  
MPC strongly supports sound, transparent 
regulations that protect human health and  the environment, allow technological  innovation and enable economic growth.  We support the goal of modernizing our nation’s regulatory framework to reduce  costly, unnecessary, and duplicative burdens  on American businesses and consumers. We 
will continue to advocate for policy solutions 
that meet this goal and lead to more efficient,  cost-effective, smarter regulation.

RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD (RFS) 
The 2007 Energy Independence and Security 
Act requires fuel manufacturers and others to blend specific volumes of biofuels – like ethanol and biodiesel – into the nation’s fuel supply. The major problem with the law is that we are required, regardless of fuel demand, to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into petroleum fuels. As a consequence of decreasing fuel demand over the past 10 years, our industry has been required to force an increased percentage of ethanol into the gasoline supply in order to meet the requirements of the RFS. The ethanol requirement imposed by the statute now exceeds 10 percent of projected gasoline demand. This makes compliance 
increasingly problematic, as most vehicles on the 
road today cannot safely accommodate fuel with higher than a 10 percent blend of ethanol. To make matters worse, the vast majority of retail stations would be required to make costly upgrades to their refueling infrastructure (such as underground storage tanks, piping and dispensers) to accommodate the sales of higher ethanol blends.
Even more alarming is that after 2022, the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unilaterally takes over the RFS, as the mandated 
biofuel volume tables expire at the end of that year. 
The EPA will then have wide discretion to set the  yearly biofuel volume requirements. 
MPC advocates allowing consumer choice, rather  
than a costly mandate, to drive the liquid 
transportation fuel market. 
 TAX REFORM 
Efforts to reform the federal tax code is a top 
priority for elected officials in both parties and a topic that poses both opportunities and challenges for MPC. We support comprehensive tax reform and believe efforts should focus on simplifying the tax code and allowing businesses to recover their costs more quickly so they can reinvest in their business. This would generate economic growth and job creation.
On the other hand, repealing important current 
provisions that allow companies to recover  cost, such as accelerated depreciation and the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) accounting method, will have a negative impact on business investment and economic growth. MPC also supports a fair tax code that treats all industries equally, and opposes tax code proposals that pick winners and losers.  
In addition to advocating for the preservation 
of various cost recovery provisions, MPC is also engaged on reforming a troubling proposal known as a Border Adjustment Tax (BAT). The BAT would have disallowed the deductibility of all imports, which would raise the tax bill for importers. Because the U.S. produces only  half of the crude oil needed to meet our nation’s demand, we are heavily reliant on imported crude oil. Artificially raising the cost of  imported crude could raise the cost of transportation fuels.  
MPC will continue to advocate on behalf of  
pro-growth tax proposals with the goal of creating a simpler and more efficient tax code.

ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENTS (DEIs )*TIER 3 AND TIER 4 DESIGNATED  
ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENTS (DEIs )*
* DEIs include three categories of environmental 
incidents: releases to the environment (air, land 
or water), environmental permit exceedances 
and agency enforcement actions. These include both MPC and Speedway. Tier 3 and 4 DEIs are the most severe types of DEIs.* DEIs include three categories of environmental 
incidents: releases to the environment (air, land or water), environmental permit exceedances and agency enforcement actions. These include both 
MPC and Speedway.CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS
Thousand tons
Tier 2 DEIs are less severe than Tier 3 and 4 DEIs. We report them 
here because we consider them a leading indicator that helps us to 
identify potential problems before they occur.Six air pollutants are designated as criteria pollutants by the Clean Air Act. They include: particulate matter (PM), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO
2), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and lead.  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a 
precursor to ground-level ozone, and as such are regulated by the EPA. MPC operations typically emit and report on SO 2, NO 2, 
VOCs, CO and PM. 2002 data includes reported emissions for the Galveston Bay refinery prior to MPC ownership. MarkWest facilities, acquired in December 2015, are not included.    For more

Baseline
Refinery emissions comprise approximately 70 percent of MPC’s direct and indirect GHG emissions. Direct emissions 
are those associated with the combustion of hydrocarbons, venting sources and fugitive sources within MPC-operated 
facilities. Indirect emissions are primarily those associated with the use of purchased electricity and steam at MPC 
facilities. Data from our baseline year of 2002 includes estimated GHG emissions and throughput for the Galveston Bay refinery prior to MPC ownership.

greets a shareholder at the 2017 Annual Shareholder Meeting.GOVERNANCE AND BUSINESS INTEGRITY
MPC adheres to a 
corporate governance 
framework that promotes 
accountability and provides transparency to 
investors, employees and 
our neighbors. Our Board of Directors is guided by 
our Corporate Governance 
Principles and committee charters, which we post on 
our website and send to 
anyone who is interested. Likewise, MPC employees, 
officers and directors are 
required to adhere  to the company’s Code of  
Business Conduct.
MPC’s Business Integrity 
and Compliance office 
implements the Code of 
Business Conduct through various programs, as 
well as administering an 
Integrity Helpline. This gives employees, business 
partners and others an 
anonymous means of reporting suspected 
violations of the code. 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016
At year-end 2016, nine of MPC’s 11 directors were independent, as defined by our Corporate Governance 
Principles. One director joined the board in early 2017 and one director retired in April 2017, and the board 
now consists of 11 directors, nine of whom are independent. The two non-independent board members 
are Gary R. Heminger, MPC chairman and chief executive officer, and Frank M. Semple, retired chairman, president and chief executive officer of MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P .83% 92% 92% 90%
These numbers include allegations and inquiries entered into MPC’s Business Compliance and Integrity case management system.
The significant increases in 2015 and 2016 are primarily due to MPC’s acquisition of approximately 
1,200 additional retail locations, which caused a large increase in the number of employees. We also 
use ongoing awareness efforts to encourage employees to report ethics or compliance concerns, 
promoting an effective “speak-up” culture.INDEPENDENT BOARD MEMBERS

provide a consistent measure.
DAR:  Days Away Rate. An OSHA term representing the number of full days of work missed by employees due to injuries, per 200,000 work hours.
DEI:  Designated Environmental Incident. A metric adopted by MPC to capture several categories simultaneously. It includes releases to the environment (including to 
air, land or water), permit exceedances and agency 
enforcement actions. MPC ranks DEIs in terms of their severity, with Tier 4 being the most severe, and Tier 1 being the least. Below are partial descriptions of the 
 
DEI Tiers:
 TIER 4
  ¾  Release of oil or other hazardous material onto the land greater than or equal to 1,000 bbl.
  ¾Release of oil or other hazardous material to a regulated 
water body greater than or equal to 100 bbl.
  ¾Reportable release to air of a hazardous material greater 
than or equal to 100 times the reportable quantity
 TIER 3 
  ¾ Release of oil or other hazardous material onto the land greater than or equal to 100 bbl. but less than 1,000 bbl.

and projections about our industry and our company. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and you should not rely unduly on them, as they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. 
While our management considers these assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and
