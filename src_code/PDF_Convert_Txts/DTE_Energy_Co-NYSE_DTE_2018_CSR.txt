Our environmental leadership and goals to cut greenhouse gas 
emissions 80% by 2040, our commitment to affordability, our 
progressive approach on workforce development, our world-
class volunteerism, and our focus on employee engagement 
and diversity and inclusion are just some of the ways we are 
serving our customers and communities – and each other. 
This document is an overview of DTE’s Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) strategy and our commitment to create 
and sustain long-term value for all stakeholders. It is part 
of an industry initiative, coordinated by the Edison Electric 
Institute and American Gas Association, and provides investors 
and other stakeholders with qualitative and quantitative ESG 
information about our company. PAGE 3 2019 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORTIntroduction
Environmental
Climate change is one of the defining public policy 
issues of our time. Just two years ago, DTE led the 
energy industry with our commitment to reduce carbon 
emissions by more than 80% by 2050. But we didn’t stop 
there. In March 2019, we announced we are accelerating 
our goal by a full decade, pledging to reduce emissions 
by 80% by 2040, when we will retire our last coal plant. 
And in the near-term, we have committed to a 50% 
carbon reduction by 2030. 
While we reduce carbon emissions from our electric 
generation, DTE Gas also has committed to reduce 
emissions of another greenhouse gas – methane – by 
more than 80%. We’re controlling methane leaks by 
replacing hundreds of miles of older natural gas pipelines 
with safer, air-tight materials and through maintenance 
upgrades at DTE natural gas compression stations. 
These goals align with the target climate scientists have 
identified as necessary to effectively address climate 
change. While it may be difficult to assess an individual 
company’s contribution to mitigating climate change, 
our carbon reduction plan assumes a tighter reduction 
curve than had been included in the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan and the U.S. 
targets from the Paris Climate Accord.Our Journey to 80% Carbon Reduction
We will achieve our commitment through aggressive 
investment in energy efficiency, renewables, a new 
state-of-the-art natural gas combined-cycle plant, our 
voluntary renewable programs and earlier coal plant 
retirements. In our 2019 Integrated Resource Plan, 
we demonstrate we can do this in a way that ensures 
our energy sources remain reliable and the power 
they produce affordable. The plan, submitted to the 
Michigan Public Service Commission per Michigan’s 
2016 energy law, focuses on the next five years and 
considers the most affordable and reliable mix of 
generation sources that are available today. We will 
continue to revisit and refine our plan as technology 
develops, customer desires and trends become more 
clear, and costs decline.
Accelerating Coal Plant Retirements
In 2022, DTE will retire three aging power plants – 
River Rouge, St. Clair and Trenton Channel, which 
account for nearly 20% of our total generation – one 
year earlier than we originally intended. We want to 
move forward as quickly as possible to achieve our 
carbon-reduction goal, and need to do it in a way 
that balances the reliability of the energy grid. We 
also are working closely with our employees and 
the impacted communities during this transition, 
including a commitment to no employee layoffs. 
We will phase out our last two coal plants over the 
next 20 years – Belle River will retire by 2030 and 
Monroe Power Plant by 2040. Reducing

Doubling Renewable Energy by 2024
DTE is Michigan’s largest renewable-energy provider. 
By 2024, we will more than double our wind and 
solar energy, generating enough clean energy to 
power 800,000 Michigan homes. By the time we 
remove all coal from our generation fleet in 2040, 
our renewable-energy portfolio will have quadrupled. 
Since 2009, we’ve driven investments of $2.8 billion 
in renewable energy – a figure that will increase to 
$4.8 billion by 2024. 
Combating climate change must be a cross-industry 
effort, so we’ve expanded our MIGreenPower 
voluntary renewables program to our large business 
and industrial customers who are working to meet 
their own sustainability goals, enabling them to 
invest in renewable energy and help drive our state 
to an even cleaner future. We recently announced 
partnerships with Ford, General Motors and the 
University of Michigan that will provide 1 million 
megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable energy 
collectively for these three customers annually. 
MIGreenPower is a voluntary renewable energy 
program that provides DTE’s residential and business 
customers with an easy and affordable way to reduce 
their carbon footprint by increasing the percentage 
of their energy use attributable to local wind and 
solar energy sources, up to 100%. Increasing Energy Efficiency
When homes and businesses reduce their energy use, we 
can generate less electricity, benefiting both customers’ 
pocketbooks and the environment. We have raised our 
commitment to increasing energy efficiency at a level 
equivalent to 1.75% of sales annually, 75% more than the level 
required by law, and up from our previous 1.5% commitment. 
Our efforts already have resulted in nearly 700 MW annually of 
reduced energy demand since 2009, equivalent to the energy 
produced by one large power plant.

2019 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORTCaring for the Environment 
At DTE Energy, we work to take care of the 
land, water and living creatures within our 
service territories and beyond. We maintain 
thousands of acres of land in its natural state 
and provide habitat for hundreds of species 
of birds, mammals, fish and insects. DTE has 
37 sites certified under the Wildlife Habitat 
Council, a nonprofit organization that helps 
companies manage their property for the 
benefit of wildlife. Our leadership in wildlife 
management was recognized by the Wildlife 
Habitat Council by winning their 2018 
Corporate Conservation Leadership Award.
DTE Electric and DTE Gas recently received 
third-party certification to the 2015 
ISO 14001 Standard for Environmental 
Management Systems. While we have had 
certified ISO 14001 facilities since 2001, 
in 2018 we completed a corporate-wide 
ISO 14001 certification that describes a 
systematic framework of processes to 
review, meet and improve our environmental 
obligations across our utility operations. 
For more information on our environmental 
performance, including information on air, 
water, waste and remediation projects, 
please see our sustainability reports at  
www.DTEImpact.com.
Ensuring Balanced And Reliable Energy
Natural gas will help us make the transition to renewables in a 
way that provides the reliability Michigan residents need, while 
significantly reducing our carbon footprint. Natural gas plants 
are a highly efficient, low-emission energy source that provide 
reliable, on-demand, 24/7 electricity. The Blue Water Energy 
Center (BWEC) will be a state-of-the-art, natural gas combined-
cycle plant and one of the most efficient plants in the United 
States. It will help to replace three retiring coal plants, allowing 
Michigan to have both a sharp reduction in carbon emissions 
and an always-available energy source. The plant represents a 
nearly $1 billion investment in Michigan. Construction jobs will 
peak at about 520 full-time positions during construction and 
will provide about 35 full-time positions once the plant is in 
operation.
The Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant, which DTE co-owns 
with Consumers Energy, is located on a 1,000-acre site on Lake 
Michigan in Mason County and is the second-largest pumped 
storage facility in the U.S. The plant generates hydroelectric 
power and supports our renewables generation because it acts 
like a giant battery that can be tapped when renewable output 
drops. The reversible turbines work as pumps when energy is 
plentiful and low-cost, such as when the sun is shining and the 
wind is blowing, and as power generators when demand is higher 
and renewable sources less abundant. An $800 million upgrade 
project to replace each of the six turbines is on schedule to be 
completed in 2020. PAGE 6 2019 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Identifying, Governing and Managing Climate-Related 
Risks 
DTE Energy has a robust process for evaluating enterprise-
level risks. The Board of Directors receives, reviews and 
assesses reports from Board committees and from management 
regarding enterprise-level climate-related risks. Our key climate-
related risks around our plan to reduce carbon emissions 80% 
by 2040 would be those that impact our ability to achieve both 
healthy financial growth and affordable customer bills. For 
example, policies that may cause a sharp acceleration of carbon 
goals could drive up customer rates too fast if we are unable to 
pace or spread the investments over an adequate timeframe. 
As a Michigan-based energy company, the physical risks from 
climate change, such as increased severe weather events and 
changing Great Lakes levels, are already incorporated into our 
business planning processes for improving the resiliency of our 
generation portfolio, as described above, and in our energy grid 
infrastructure upgrade strategy.Creating a Smarter Energy Grid
To meet the needs of today’s modern homes 
and high-tech businesses, Michigan’s aging 
infrastructure requires significant investment. 
DTE Energy is doing its part by spending nearly 
$4.2 billion from 2018-2022 on upgrading the 
distribution system to improve the safety and 
reliability for the customers we serve while 
continuing to provide an affordable energy source. 
Our strategy encompasses many technical projects 
concentrated in four main areas: 
• Tree trimming – trimming trees across 31,000 
miles of overhead power lines. Two-thirds of 
the time that DTE customers spend without 
power is due to trees. Trimming trees has 
proven to reduce tree-related outages by up to 
70%.
• Infrastructure resilience and hardening 
– replacing poles and wires, and installing 
equipment to reduce outage lengths and limit 
the number of customers impacted by an 
outage event.
• Infrastructure redesign – converting older 
circuits and substations to more modern design 
and technology standards, as well as expanding 
the electrical system to meet growing demand
• Technology and automation – high-tech 
distribution management systems, and 
system monitoring and automation to improve 
reliability and system performance
These upgrades will strengthen the energy grid 
and positively impact Michigan’s economy, bringing 
jobs through both DTE hires and partnerships 
with local contractors and businesses. In areas 
where infrastructure work has already been 
completed, DTE’s customers have seen up to a 70% 
improvement in reliability. PAGE 7 2019 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORTIntroduction
Social
DTE views its ESG commitments through a holistic lens 
that includes our employees, customers, communities 
and investors. We believe that when these – our primary 
stakeholders – thrive, so too will our company. 
Our Employees
Our work with our employees and customers is deeply intertwined. In 
providing employees with a safe, healthy, engaging and diverse work 
environment, we increase their satisfaction and, in turn, their service to 
our customers. DTE is ranked in the top three percent among employers 
worldwide in engagement by Gallup. The extraordinary improvement we’ve 
experienced in this ranking can be attributed to a persistent focus on 
engagement, including our top decile safety performance, comprehensive 
health and wellness programs, a robust Diversity and Inclusion Program 
that has launched eight employee resource groups, and a thriving 
volunteerism program that reached world-class status in 2018. 
With an eye toward a wave of impending retirements, DTE also is creating 
opportunities for students and those with barriers to employment to join 
our company in the years ahead. DTE sponsored 1,500 summer youth 
employment opportunities across the state and took a leadership role 
in revitalizing two career and technical educational schools in Detroit, 
increasing enrollment more than 700% and preparing students to fill 
the jobs gap. We are amplifying our impact by engaging our peers and 
suppliers: DTE’s and our peers’ suppliers have partnered to provide 2,000 
entry-level positions for Detroiters.Our Customers
Our commitment to providing clean 
and reliable energy extends to all 
our customers, including those who 
are vulnerable. DTE enrolled 34,000 
households in our Low-Income 
Self Sufficiency Plan in 2018. The 
company also hosted 20 Customer 
Assistance Days statewide, helping 
our economically vulnerable customers 
access $3 million in energy assistance. 
In addition, DTE donated $10 million to 
The Heat and Warmth Fund in further 
assistance to vulnerable households. The 
non-profit provides help to the elderly, 
unemployed, underemployed and 
disabled people in energy crisis. 5,100

From the revitalization of neighborhoods to economic development, outreach 
into the community is key to our company’s culture. 
DTE works in neighborhoods across our service territory to help residents 
realize their vision for their community. From placemaking to beautification and 
workforce development, we work hand-in-hand with residents.
We also are leading the way in building bridges between the city and the 
surrounding communities because the economic success of our region is integral 
to the success of our business. With DTE’s leadership and support, the Detroit 
Regional Partnership, a new and collaborative regional economic development 
group that represents 11 counties in southeast Michigan, is creating a world-
class marketing and attraction economic development arm, sending a message 
to the world that Southeast Michigan is a united region, has strong assets and is 
open for business.
From a statewide perspective, DTE spent more than $1.7 billion with Michigan 
suppliers in 2018 and will increase that commitment to $1.9 billion in 2019 -- a 
four-fold increase since 2011. Additionally, we add more than $200 million to 
local economies annually across Michigan with our Foundation’s support of 
festivals and events. DTE’s own Beacon Park, developed on a former industrial 
parcel adjacent to our headquarters, has spurred $140 million in development in 
its neighborhood and attracted more than a million visitors since its opening in 
2017.
As a result of these efforts, DTE’s customer satisfaction has improved year over 
year, as evidenced by strong J.D. Power and Associates. In 2018, DTE also was 
named among the Civic 50 by Points of Light, recognizing DTE as one of the 
top 50 corporate citizens in the country, the top-ranking utility and the only 
Michigan-based company to receive the award.Our Investors
We believe that ESG best practices - 
such as producing clean, affordable 
and reliable energy, emphasizing 
workplace diversity and inclusion and 
providing strong corporate governance 
policies and practices - will continue 
our ability to create long-term value 
while effectively managing risk. Over 
the last five years, we have consistently 
reached out to engage our investors in 
ESG discussions. These discussions have 
helped us understand what’s important 
to investors and provided a way for our 
Board of Directors and management 
to proactively respond to investor 
feedback. We also remain committed 
to improving our ESG transparency and 
enhancing our disclosures. Over the 
last several years, ESG investing has 
grown exponentially, and investors are 
increasingly taking into account the ESG 
performance of corporations in their 
investment strategies. In response, we 
are working aggressively to enhance 
the quality of our ESG information – in 
news releases, investor presentations, 
and on our website – and make it easily 
accessible for investors and rating 
agencies. Investing $9.2 billion with
