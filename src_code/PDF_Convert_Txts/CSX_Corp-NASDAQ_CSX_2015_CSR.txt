Welcome to CSX’s 2015 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, Moving Forward.
The primary function of our business is to move the essential goods that feed, fuel, and build communities. Just as CSX trains are always headed to the 
next destination, this company is constantly looking to the future. We’re transforming into the CSX of Tomorrow – while continuing to make decisions that advance the interests of customers, the environment and all of the people we serve.
This sixth-annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report tracks CSX’s performance against key goals and explores the importance of those goals 
to the diverse stakeholders who work with, and depend on, this company. Following a globally-recognized reporting process helps CSX understand stakeholders’ priorities, reflect on achievements and identify areas of opportunity. 
Let me share three highlights from 2015 that provide great encouragement for the future:
 · CSX is investing in infrastructur
e to stimulate economic growth and job creation along the company’s network. Construction has begun on the Virginia Avenue Tunnel in 
Washington, D.C., where CSX is rebuilding a 110-year-old tunnel to remove a historic freight bottleneck and expand double-stack intermodal service availability. This privately-funded infrastructure project promotes the conversion of freight from congested highways to rail and further leverages the efficiency and environmental benefits of freight rail for moving consumer goods.
 · CSX r
emains committed to safety, as evidenced by the fact that freight rail continues to be the safest form of land transportation. In 2015, CSX continued its network maintenance 
by replacing 3.3 million ties and replacing or resurfacing more than 5,500 miles of track. In addition, CSX’s Safety Train rolling classroom made 20 stops across the network to share incident response expertise and build relationships at the local level. CSX has also supported resilient, safe communities by contributing to the recovery efforts led by the American Red Cross for the last 20 years and continuing the company’s Play It Safe initiative to promote safety awareness and education for motorists and pedestrians around the railroad.
 · CSX continues to foster an inclusive and dynamic work envir
onment. In 2015, CSX was again named to G.I. Jobs’ Top 100 Most Military Friendly Employers list, and veterans, 
reservists, and active duty military members made up 25 percent of new employees. CSX was also named one of ComputerWorld’s 100 Best Places to Work in IT, reflecting an innovative culture that is helping to propel the company with advanced technology.
With accomplishments come higher expectations, and there is more work to be done in the quest to be ever-better. Please join us, and help us, on the continued journey to be the safest, most progressive North American railroad.

22CSX’s rail network encompasses about 21,000 route miles of track across 23 states 
and two Canadian provinces. The network connects every major metropolitan area in the eastern United States, where nearly two-thirds of the nation’s population resides. It also links more than 240 short-line railroads and more than 70 ocean, river, and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, and the St. Lawrence Seaway.
As global population grows, the benefits of freight rail are ever-more valuable. 
Rail supports the broader transportation infrastructure that is critical to American competitiveness and encourages collaboration between the private and public sectors. In addition to being the safest form of land transportation, freight rail dramatically minimizes emissions compared with other forms of land transportation and takes traffic off the congested highway system. Importantly, rail provides efficient and competitively priced transportation solutions.
Every point along CSX’s network creates commercial potential and local opportunities 
to make a positive difference. As the company evolves into the CSX of Tomorrow, the commitment to shareholders, customers, employees, and communities will remain. (G4-4; G4-5; G4-6; G4-9; G4-17)

& GovernanceTRACKING THE TRENDS:  
A 2015 UPDATE
In the 2014 report, CSX highlighted five trends that are influencing society. As a 
significant player in major supply chains and with a network that reaches nearly two-thirds of the American population, CSX’s progress is intertwined with those trends. Here is an update on those trends and the impact to CSX today
 —
 and to
 
the CSX of Tomorrow.
The Century of Cities
According to the World Bank, 54 percent of the global 
population lives in urban areas.1 By 2045, the urban population 
is estimated to increase by 1.5 times to 6 billion, adding 2 billion more urban residents. Providing a reliable and well-connected transport system is critical to creating sustainable, 
safe, resilient, and connected cities. CSX connects every major metropolitan area in the eastern United States, and reaches two in three American consumers through its transportation network. Read more in Safety & Security. 
New Marketplace
Emerging economies and growing trade are redefining the 
global marketplace. Businesses of all sizes are increasingly becoming part of the global supply chain. This growing, vastly broadened marketplace means there are more goods to be transported and more complex supply chains to be made. 
To learn more about the evolution of the marketplace and how CSX is prepared to capitalize on new opportunities, visit Evolving Economy.
Changing Workforce Demographics
Millennials became the largest share of the American workforce 
in 2015. Organizations are adapting and sometimes re-imagining talent strategies that match the diverse generations and skills in today’s workforce. To find out more information about how CSX is working to be an employer of choice for all 
generations, go to the Employees chapter.Culture of Collaboration
Bridges and roads continue to age and face surging demand while 
there are limited resources for new infrastructure. Governments and businesses are looking to public-private partnerships to fund development projects. Research shows that public-private partnerships are also now used in more than 130 developing 
countries, contributing about 15–20 percent of total global infrastructure investment. CSX’s collaborative investment in communities includes new infrastructure projects, first responder training, and national and local non-profit partnerships. CSX’s outreach programs emphasize building mutually beneficial relationships with partners, customers, and neighbors that support more resilient communities. Read more in Business Performance & Governance and Communities.
Weather Variability
Catastrophic weather events can disrupt communities and 
commercial activity. CSX continues to make its operations more resilient to unpredictable weather conditions by investing in its workforce and infrastructure to increase preparedness and mitigate impacts. CSX also implements business practices 
and technologies that minimize the company’s environmental footprint and supports organizations working to enhance community preparedness and foster environmental stewardship. To learn more about how CSX prepares for, responds to, and seeks to improve environmental conditions, see the Environment & Efficiency chapter.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT
From March 1, 2015 to February 29, 2016, CSX conducted an assessment to 
identify material issues. That assessment included the criteria referenced below:
 · Material issues r
eported in CSX’s 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
Report were used for the 2015 CSR Report materiality assessment (refer to About This Report for 2014 and 2015 issues list).
 · CSX established eight inter
nal and external stakeholder groups and identified 
stakeholders within each group to survey, including: 
 · Employees, Customers, Suppliers, Nonpr
ofit Organizations, Government 
Organizations, Short Line Partners, Community Members, and Investors
 · CSX pr
epared an online survey containing the material issues list and received 
survey responses from more than 100 internal and external stakeholders. 
 · The survey asked stakeholders to rate issues on a 1 to 10 scale, with 1 being Not Important and 10 being V
ery Important to the long-term success 
of CSX’s business · CSX weighted the customer and supplier r
esponses to allow for comparability year-
over-year between 2014 and 2015. This weighting resulted in customer response ratings for each issue in the survey being multiplied by 1.61 and supplier response ratings for each issue in the survey being multiplied by 0.67.
 · Material issues wer
e ranked based on the weighted average ratings of all stakeholder 
survey responses and the top 20 issues are presented in the materiality matrix.
 · CSX conducted interviews and focus gr
oups with Employees, Customers, 
Suppliers, and Nonprofit Organizations to document additional insights regarding select material issues included in the 2015 materiality matrix.
Ernst & Young LLP , CSX’s independent accountants, have performed review-level assurance for the time period of March 1, 2015 through February 29, 2016 on the materiality assessment described above. Ernst & Young’s Review Report can be found in the About This Report section.

The material issues map presents the results of the materiality assessment, showing the relative importance of the top 20 issues to both stakeholders and CSX’s business. While all 
of the topics represented are important, the issues in Tier 1 in the top right-hand corner were identified as those that stakeholders consider to be the most material to CSX. Those in Tier 2 are also considered material to the business.
The colors of the issues on the map indicate their alignment within the sections of this report. Discussion of each issue will be primarily focused in the corresponding report section, 
as denoted by color. For example, the issue of Security & Infrastructure Protection, marked in orange, will be emphasized and discussed in the Safety & Security section. (G4-18)

onment & EfficiencyTREND IN CONTEXT:  
NEW MARKETPLACE
As the global population grows, demand for goods is increasing and capacity is 
constrained. Reuters finds that “for the first time in history, a truly global middle class is emerging. Rapid growth in China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia will cause Asia’s share of the new middle [class] to more than double from its current 30 percent.”
 3
These populations are also becoming more technologically-savvy and moving toward an online marketplace, where buyers and sellers can connect directly across country borders. Pew Research reported a “noticeable rise over the past two years in the percentage of people in the emerging and developing nations... who use the Internet and own a smartphone.” As the marketplace expands its geographic borders, and consumers and businesses connect online, anywhere, anytime, the world requires more flexible and integrated transportation solutions.
Increasingly, intermodal—which uses at least two modes of transportation to move 
freight—is providing the answer by moving products in a timely and safe fashion. Intermodal solutions create more capacity and fluidity within the transportation network, as trucks and trains work together so supply chain managers can utilize the best channel for each part of the journey.
CSX is investing in its intermodal network to capture this market. In early 2015, 
CSX completed the installation of two additional wide-span gantry cranes at its intermodal hub in northwest Ohio, which means the facility can increase the number of containers it can process. CSX also began reconstructing the Virginia Avenue Tunnel in Washington, D.C. to create capacity for efficient double-stacked freight. In addition, the construction of the Pittsburgh Intermodal Rail Terminal, which began in 2015, further expands CSX’s intermodal service offering. Currently, CSX is examining new opportunities to expand intermodal connectivity in the growing Carolina region. Together, these projects will help connect businesses to the global marketplace by shifting freight from highways to rail and enable service for shippers in smaller, growing markets.

onment & EfficiencyLEARNING FROM LEADERS
As the marketplace evolves, businesses must adjust to the trends and look for places 
to capitalize on new opportunities. In this section, three of CSX’s leaders offer their perspectives on some of the most pressing issues in the global marketplace, and how CSX is responding and preparing for the future. Read on for insights from:
 ·Fr
edrik Eliasson, Executive Vice President and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer,
 ·Cindy Sanbor
n, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and
 ·Frank Lonegr
o, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
What changes is CSX seeing in the marketplace and how is the company responding?
Fredrik: There are two types of changes: longer-term macro-trends and near-term 
shifts. As a nearly 190-year-old, capital-intensive railroad operator, we have a good 
track record of spotting the macro-trends and adjusting and investing to address them. For example, we know that intermodal is becoming increasingly attractive to customers, and we have made a decision to shift toward a hub-and-spoke strategy which supports that business. We have invested in new, longer trains that are more efficient and more environmentally sustainable
 —
 and of
fer even clearer competitive 
advantages over long-distance highway freight.
Cindy: At the same time, we are responding to shifts in global markets that have 
a direct impact on our volume. We’ve experienced decreased demand in the 
Appalachian region of our network, which has a long history tied to the rail industry. We ended the year by having to furlough some employees, which was a difficult decision, but one that was made in order to adjust to the current demand and keep CSX’s business success sustainable for the future.
Fredrik: What remains consistent is our focus on meeting and exceeding customer 
expectations, and running the most reliable and safe network in North America.
How did international markets affect CSX in 2015?
Frank: While our operational footprint is limited to the U.S. and Canada, our business is 
deeply connected to movements in international markets. Railroads have always been 
a barometer for the wider global economy, and in 2015, we were early to detect many of the trends that are continuing today—including softening demand for commodities, declining oil prices, and continuing uncertainty in European economies. We serve approximately 60 percent of the U.S. economy and feel optimistic about CSX’s future. While international factors undoubtedly affected our performance in 2015, we still see areas for profitability and growth which will keep the company resilient, strong, and growing in the long run.
How did extreme weather affect CSX’s operations and performance in 2015?
Cindy: Severe winter weather in early 2015 affected several segments of the CSX 
network. We have learned some valuable lessons from the past two winters. We are now better prepared to handle weather disruptions and restore network fluidity quicker than we were, even just a year ago. For example, we ramped up our locomotive program, bringing online around 350 new and upgraded locomotives during 2015. We also added and improved technology for winter preparedness and prepared rapid response teams to quickly react when catastrophic weather did occur.

onment & EfficiencyHow else is CSX using technology to manage business challenges?
Frank: Investing in technology is critical to CSX’s future and sustainability. Cindy recently 
told employees at a meeting that innovation isn’t a series of technology inventions, it’s 
a discipline to constantly find new ways to problem solve
 —
 and I agr
ee. We continue 
to see that advanced technologies are a win-win for our business and our customers, boosting productivity, generating cost savings, and strengthening customer service. Technology is also enabling efficiency by reducing CSX’s environmental footprint and improving safety. One example is investment in Positive Train Control (PTC), which has been one of the biggest projects ever undertaken by the rail industry and has required the participation of virtually every department within CSX. We believe that, when installed and tested appropriately, PTC will enable great safety and efficiency enhancements to the network. CSX will continue to utilize cutting-edge technologies and innovations whenever there are opportunities to improve performance and increase safety.
How do you manage such a diverse workforce spread across a large network?
Cindy: Our people come from all kinds of backgrounds and cover an expansive 
geographic area. That’s why CSX’s Core Values are so important. They allow us to maintain a strong culture and a common commitment to always gaining the best perspectives, which requires having diverse perspectives.
Frank: We also know it’s critical to provide the training and resources needed on 
the job every day. We continue to invest in best-in-class development opportunities, including the CSX Railroad Education and Development Institute’s 60 front-line rail operations training programs. We also work to equip employees with advanced engineering skills and technologies, such as robotics and mobile apps, to allow them to focus on the highest-value work available.
Cindy: Development has driven my career at CSX, where I began nearly 30 years 
ago. I’m proud to come from a railroading family, and my parents instilled in me a love for railroading and an appreciation of how important it is to the success of America. It’s important to remember that a majority of the rail industry’s workforce is unionized. We continue to work with the union representatives to create agreements that make CSX a good place to work. In 2015, we reached an agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers that improves flexibility and productivity for our people. Having an informed and engaged workforce helps CSX provide the best service
 — and we hope that it will keep employees committed to a
 
rewarding career at CSX.Looking at the big picture, how are CSX’s actions supporting the future of America’s infrastructure?
Fredrik: Modern, safe, and reliable infrastructure is not only good for CSX, it’s 
essential for the U.S. economy and long-term competitiveness. World-class rail infrastructure not only means better service for our customers, but it also creates more vibrant local economies, ensures community safety and accessibility, decreases highway congestion, and reduces environmental impacts.
Frank: This is why we continue to invest heavily in infrastructure improvements 
and partner with the public sector on significant projects. In 2015, CSX’s infrastructure investment reached $2.6 billion. I’m particularly proud of our role in the redevelopment of the former Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Yard. We took a facility that had operated for more than 100 years and are upgrading it into a state-of-the-art intermodal facility. We’re also investing in the District of Columbia by replacing the existing Virginia Avenue Tunnel, which is more than 110 years old.17

Adjusting to fluctuations in each market creates new opportunities and 
challenges
 —
 whether that’
s identifying the best operating plan to match a customer’s 
demand levels or creating solutions to serve a new growing market. This market overview shows the breadth of markets served by CSX and how each market performed in 2015 as measured by carload volume and revenue totals. (G4-8)
Agricultural Products: CSX moved 411,000 carloads of agricultural products in 2015 
for revenue of $1.087 billion, a 2 percent volume decrease from 2014. Volume declined due to challenging world market conditions and a strong U.S. dollar. Specifically, high levels of imported ethanol reduced rail moves to Eastern markets and export grain was down significantly. These declines were partially offset by strength in feed grain and domestic soybean moves, reflecting the record 2014-2015 harvest.
Phosphates and Fertilizers: CSX moved 301,000 carloads of phosphates and 
fertilizers in 2015, for revenue of $489 million, resulting in a 9 percent volume decrease from 2014. Volume declines reflected the weak demand for fertilizers driven by oversupply, low corn prices and a challenged export market due to strength of the U.S. dollar.
Food and Consumer: CSX moved 92,000 carloads of food and consumer products 
in 2015, for revenue of $258 million in 2015, a 2 percent decrease in volume from 2014. Volume declined as excess truck capacity and poor western crop yields in produce led to lower shipments of fresh foods.
Chemicals: CSX moved 621,000 carloads of chemicals in 2015, for revenue of 
$2.093 billion, keeping the volume flat year-over-year. Volume was flat as strong gains in LPG and petroleum products were offset by a slowdown in crude oil and frac sand due to low oil prices.
Automotive: CSX moved 450,000 automotive carloads for revenue of $1.175 billion 
in 2015, a 3 percent increase in volume compared to 2014. Volume increased as gains in auto movement, especially SUVs and trucks, resulted from strong North American light vehicle production and consumer demand.
Metals: CSX moved 233,000 carloads of metals for revenue of $596 million in 2015, 
resulting in a 16 percent decrease in volume from 2014. Volume declined due to high levels of steel imports which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar and led to lower production of domestic steel.Forest Products: CSX moved 290,000 forest product carloads in 2015, for revenue of $796 million, a 6 percent volume decrease from 2014. Volume declines reflect high inventories of building products in the housing sector as well as declining demand due to electronic substitution in paper products.
Minerals: CSX moved 311,000 carloads of minerals for revenue of $469 million 
in 2015, a 6 percent volume increase from 2014. Volume growth reflects strength in aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand, and gravel) due to increased highway and non-residential construction activity.
Waste and Equipment: CSX moved 151,000 carloads of waste and equipment in 
2015, for revenue of $308 million, a 4 percent volume decrease from 2014. Volume was down as a result of the conclusion of a customer’s major remediation project and reduced military vehicle movement partially offset by increases in municipal waste.
Coal: CSX moved 1.063 million carloads of coal for revenue of $2.3 billion in 2015, 
resulting in a 16 percent volume decrease from 2014. Domestic coal volume declined as a result of mild weather, high stockpiles and low natural gas prices favoring natural gas power generation. For export coal, reductions in both metallurgical and thermal coal volume resulted from ongoing weak market conditions due to global oversupply and the strength of the U.S. dollar.
Intermodal: CSX moved 2.838 million intermodal containers in 2015, for revenue of 
$1.762 billion, a 4 percent increase in volume from 2014. Domestic volume increased 12 percent due to customer growth, continued success with CSX’s highway-to-rail conversion program and new service offerings. In the international intermodal market, competitive losses resulted in a 5 percent international volume decline during a volatile year marked by West Coast port disruption, a subsequent volume surge and then a weaker-than-average peak season.Business Performance

onment & EfficiencyTREND IN CONTEXT:  
CULTURE OF COLLABORATION
Maintaining and developing infrastructure frequently requires close collaboration 
between the government, public organizations, private companies, and community 
members. CSX supports America’s rail infrastructure on both sides of the life cycle: 
to maintain and grow strategic projects, as well as determine the safest, best use 
of rail resources after they are no longer needed in an area due to the relocation of customers, decreased demand, or they reach the end of a useful life.
When a rail corridor is no longer needed for operations, CSX is a proponent of 
converting rail to trails for alternative transportation use through a process often called “railbanking.” CSX first identifies conversion opportunities where the company 
is ceasing operations, and then determines whether it will overlap with uses for 
the public, such as green spaces. Then, CSX works with communities to sell the 
property at fair market value. The CSX Real Property team and the Public Safety, 
Health, and Environment department also developed a process to review operations 
and identify any potential environmental impacts of a property prior to the sale.Among many transactions in 2015, CSX completed a transaction in Athens, Georgia. 
The former rail corridor will become part of the Firefly Trail stretching from Athens 
to Union Point. Once complete, it will connect residential neighborhoods to the 
University of Georgia, providing alternative transportation routes for bicyclists and 
walkers and reducing road traffic.
“This trail will serve Athens-Clarke County citizens and visitors along with staff and 
students of the University of Georgia by connecting existing trails and future planned 
trails for multi-purpose recreation and personal transportation, including pedestrians 
and non-motorized vehicles,” said Derek Doster, Project Administrator for Athens-
Clarke County. “This section is also conveniently located in close proximity to a public 
Park and Ride, making it very accessible and usable for the public.”

onment & EfficiencyCORE VALUES IN ACTION
It starts with the customer | Reliable service is our key to growth. Grow by 
understanding and meeting needs. Become easier to do business with. Own their 
problems–win their business. (G4-EC7)
CSX uses the term “Service Excellence” to describe how all employees, regardless 
of title, can improve customer experience through cutting-edge technologies and 
tailored solutions.
In 2012, the company first launched its Service Excellence initiative in the Chicago 
and Nashville divisions, empowering front line employees from operations and sales 
and marketing to coordinate between internal teams and shift from thinking of CSX as a service provider to CSX as a partner and solutions-finder. For example, Service 
Excellence includes periodic meetings where a diverse group of representatives 
from different departments join to solve customer concerns at the ground level and 
discuss growth opportunities.
Service Excellence was successful as a new program because its mission
 —
 putting 
a customer first and finding innovative solutions
 —
 had always been a part of the CSX 
DNA. Once it was formally intr
oduced, the initiative produced measurable, positive 
results and garnered support, from train crews to the leadership team. Since 2012, 
it has been rolled out to all operating divisions, engaging all employees to recognize 
that their daily actions ultimately impact the customer experience. Along with 
better customer service, “Service Excellence” creates internal awards as well, as it 
frequently helps the company achieve better asset utilization.

onment & EfficiencyFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
In 2015, CSX generated $11.8 billion in revenue, nearly $3.6 billion in operating income, and the company’s first sub-70 full-year operating ratio at 69.7 percent, despite $500 
million in losses in one of its most significant markets—coal.
The company delivered earnings per share of $2.00, up four percent from 2014. CSX also improved shareholder value through actions announced in 2015, including a 13 percent 
increase in the quarterly dividend and a new $2 billion share repurchase program.
CSX delivered a total cost reduction of nearly $375 million, which includes both efficiency initiatives and savings from rightsizing resources to match demand. CSX also chose 
to find cost savings through the voluntary transfer of its stock exchange listing from the New York Stock Exchange to The Nasdaq Global Select Market, a transaction that was 
effective after market close on December 21, 2015.

onment & EfficiencyCORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CSX is committed to top tier corporate governance practices and achieving the right 
results in the right way. The CSX Executive Team and Board of Directors understand 
the opportunities and challenges across the business and help make decisions that 
support the company’s long-term growth and success. As of December 31, 2015:
 · The Executive T
eam consists of seven individuals with diverse experience and is 
led by Chairman and CEO, Michael J. Ward.
 · The Boar
d of Directors has 12 members. Two members of the Board are women 
of color. (G4-LA12)
 · All members of the Boar
d, with the exception of Michael J. Ward, are independent.
 · The Boar
d has five standing committees, which each met at least five times in 
2015, in addition to the five or more full Board meetings each year. It also has an 
Executive Committee, which did not meet in 2015.
 · The Public Af
fairs Committee has responsibility for Corporate Social Responsibility, 
overseeing compliance with legal requirements and internal policies relating to 
equal employment, diversity in the workplace, employee safety, environmental 
impact, and corporate citizenship. (G4-34)
More information about the Executive Team and Board of Directors is available on the 
corporate governance page of the company’s website. (G4-34)
Shareholders may communicate with the Board in writing or through attending 
the Annual Shareholders Meeting and various investor conferences. Shareholders 
are welcome to communicate with the Board of Directors at the address listed in 
“About This Report.” Shareholders may also request a free, printed copy of the CSX 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, the CSX Code of Ethics, the charters of each 
Board committee, and Board policies.
ETHICS
The CSX Code of Ethics lays out standards for the ethical behavior of all employees, 
officers, and Directors of the corporation and its subsidiaries. It covers matters such 
as conflicts of interest, insider trading, confidential information misuse, compliance with laws and regulations, discrimination and harassment, whistle-blower protection, 
public and employee safety, and proper use of corporate assets. (G4-56)
In addition to the Code of Ethics, CSX also has the following practices and policies in 
place to promote ethical behavior:
 · Ethics and Compliance T
rainings: Each year, management employees complete 
multiple training courses on ethics and compliance, including anti-corruption policies. In 
2015, 100 percent of management employees completed the mandatory ethics training. 
Approximately 88 percent of craft employees voluntarily completed the ethics training 
course in 2015, compared with 84 percent of union employees in 2014. (G4-SO4)
 · Reporting Unethical or Unlawful Behavior: CSX employees can voice concer
ns 
if they suspect a violation of the Code of Ethics or are unsure about undertaking 
certain actions through the 24-hour CSX Ethics Helpline and associated website. 
In 2015, CSX received 1,376 inquiries (128 of which were repeat issues) via 
the Helpline, website, and letters. When violations are uncovered during the 
investigation process, the Ethics team ensures appropriate action is taken to 
resolve the issue. CSX management reviews aggregate Helpline activity with the 
Audit Committee at least once per year. (G4-58)
 · Anti-Competition and Anti-Corruption: CSX believes in fair competition, complies 
with antitrust laws, and expects all employees to comply with the company’
s strict 
antitrust and anti-corruption policies. (G4-DMA Anti-Corruption and G4-DMA Anti-
Competitiveness Behavior)
BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT
CSX strives to responsibly manage inherent business risks. The goal is to proactively 
identify and mitigate risks which have the ability to impact CSX’s objectives. In 
pursuing this goal, CSX adheres to a risk assessment process that is closely 
aligned with business strategy and the compliance, external, and strategic risks of 
the business. The company’s approach to business risk management focuses on 
activities the company owns or controls, as well as those outside the company.
During 2015, CSX identified and reviewed risk factors that could have a materially 
adverse effect on the company, including:25

These and many other identified risks ar

by leaders within CSX, along with CSX’s Board of Directors or a committee of the 
Board. The Audit Committee of the Board provides overall monitoring of the risk 
management process.
CYBERSECURITY
CSX uses many technology applications to run its business, such as systems 
that automate daily activities and systems that plan and inventory train movement 
to increase efficiency. As a vital component of the nation’s infrastructure, CSX 
understands the critical importance of a secure technology network to protect 
customers, employees, and communities. In 2015, the company reported no incidents 
related to breaches of data or disruption of rail service due to cybersecurity issues.
The company invests in cybersecurity protocols that seek to ensure prevention in a 
dynamic threat environment. CSX’s cybersecurity team proactively detects technology 
threats and responds to prevent intrusion and minimize potential impacts. 
In the past year, significant cybersecurity activities have included internal and external 
reviews of the CSX security program against best-practice frameworks, reviewing 
the internal CSX network design relative to the ability to monitor and control 
communication traffic, augmenting controls to better address potentially destructive cyber scenarios, improving monitoring for security events, and improving protection 
against unauthorized system access. 
CSX also partners with enforcement agencies to deliver timely cyber intelligence 
and conducts regular audits to ensure processes are functioning as designed. The 
full Internet privacy and information security policy can be found on the Privacy 
page of the website here.PUBLIC POLICY AND CONTRIBUTIONS
CSX often interacts with federal, state, and local governments and regulatory agencies 
to discuss aspects of the business and potential outcomes of legislative and regulatory 
actions. In these interactions, the company and its employees act in compliance with 
federal, state, and local laws and regulations. CSX is also a member of organizations 
that support policies for a strong business and economic environment, including the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, Association of American Railroads, 
and Business for Social Responsibility. CSX’s political and third-party contributions, as well as independent expenditures, are disclosed on the website. (G4-DMA Public 
Policy; G4-SO6)
CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS
As a transportation services provider, CSX is in the business of making connections. 
The company creates responsible transportation between points on the value chain – 
from suppliers to customers, and then on to consumers.
Customers
CSX continues to invest in training, communication, and technologies to improve the 
customer experience. In 2015, CSX achieved an overall satisfaction score of 108, 
which is managed by J.D. Power and tracked through the company’s annual Voice 
of the Customer survey. Overall satisfaction scores are comprised of service as the 
main indicator, along with planning and customer assistance scores. In 2015, a total 
of 569 employees received an award for outstanding performance, the CSX Service 
STAR Award, nearly half of which came directly from the survey. (G4-PR5)

onment & Efficiency · Communication:  CSX communicates regularly with customers through many 
cross-functional forums and workshops and the company’s Customer Advisory 
Council, which meets twice a year. In 2015, 14 active CSX customers served  
on the Council. 
 · T
echnologies: CSX provides train updates, tracks shipments, and manages 
customer inquiries through a suite of mobile tools on ShipCSX.com and ShipCSX 
Mobile. CSX has also been integrating the Mobile Rail Tool into train operations. 
The company developed this tablet technology to better service customers with 
real-time data, including:
 ·Automatically logging arrival and departur
e times;
 ·Accessing the most r
ecent customer maps; and 
 ·Easily sending customer notifications about shipment arrival time. 
 Compr
ehensive Approach: CSX uses a Total Service Integration process to support 
customer needs when loading or unloading products. By reducing this transition time, 
both CSX and customers can find efficiencies and open more capacity.  
(G4-DMA Product and Service Labeling)
Suppliers
CSX works with approximately 7,000 suppliers throughout its network and 
internationally. The company procures the vast majority of supplies and services 
through a centralized, competitive supplier selection process. This process 
incorporates cost considerations, long-term maintenance, quality, the logistics of 
materials and services, and environmental and labor policies.
To better manage risks and relationships within the supply chain, CSX determines 
critical Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers using a segmentation process that identifies top 
suppliers on the basis of criticality, risk, and spend. There are currently 16 Tier 1 
and 15 Tier 2 suppliers. CSX evaluates environmental risks within its supply chain 
and opportunities for partnership with suppliers by using CDP’s Supply Chain 
questionnaire. Many of CSX’s customers request greenhouse gas emissions and 
other environmental data through CDP’s Supply Chain program. CSX passes 
that request on to all Tier 1 and 2 suppliers as well as other selected suppliers to 
maximize transparency and identify areas for continuous improvement.
CSX’s contract language requires suppliers to uphold laws and regulations and 
maintain corporate policies that support diversity and non-discrimination. A specially trained team of supplier quality auditors reviews supplier policies and procedures to gauge safety, environmental, and other quality factors. More information on the 
environmental performance of suppliers can be found in the Environment & Efficiency 
section. (G4-12)
The CSX Supplier Diversity Program gives suppliers of all sizes an equal opportunity 
to compete to provide required services and commodities CSX needs to effectively 
run its business. In 2015, CSX’s diverse spend was more than $132 million. This 
spend includes transactions with more than 250 businesses, including those that 
are certified through agencies such as the Women’s Business Enterprise National 
Council and National Minority Supplier Development Council.

onment & EfficiencyLOCAL IMPACT 
CSX helps contribute to the economic health of communities across the network 
by providing wages and benefits to employees and retirees; paying taxes at the local, state, and federal level; and helping to grow commerce and attract more local business. CSX also helps fuel local economies through job opportunities, new facilities, and support of business operations on and around the rail network. In 2015, CSX worked with customers on 107 projects to build or expand facilities along its network. CSX customers invested more than $2.2 billion in these projects, which are expected to generate approximately 1,500 new jobs in communities served by CSX. Since 2000, customers along CSX’s 23-state network have helped create more than 62,000 jobs.For all of the benefits these projects bring, they can mean major changes for the communities where they are constructed. CSX believes that maintaining an ongoing, two-way conversation with stakeholders is the best approach to all infrastructure projects. Just as the geographies that CSX serves are diverse, each of the company’s infrastructure projects requires a customized approach.

VIRGINIA AVENUE TUNNEL:   
After receiving final permitting approval in 2015, CSX began the reconstruction of 
the more than 110-year-old Virginia Avenue Tunnel to create capacity for double-
stacked freight, thereby significantly reducing rail and truck congestion around 
the Washington, D.C. region. Chief Project Engineer, Chuck Gullakson, lives 
near the site and hosts periodic “Coffee with Chuck” morning briefings where 
residents can join in an informal conversation about the project status and ask 
questions. Information is also available at www.virginiaavenuetunnel.com or at

PITTSBURGH INTERMODAL RAIL TERMINAL:   
In September 2015, CSX began construction on an intermodal 
terminal in Stowe Township and the Borough of McKees Rocks 
outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The project, which revives the 
former Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Rail Yard, represents a CSX investment 
of more than $60 million and will create new opportunities for jobs 
and development in the region. In this close-knit community, CSX has 
created a Facebook group for project updates, along with a dedicated 
webpage at www.railpittsburgh.com.CAROLINA CONNECTOR  
INTERMODAL RAIL TERMINAL:  
In early 2016, CSX announced plans to develop a new 
intermodal rail terminal in North Carolina. This terminal will serve as a major transportation hub in the South, a catalyst for economic growth in the region, and a competitive advantage for the Carolinas. CSX is currently working with state and local leaders, and listening to residents, to find the best solution for locating this terminal.

CENTURY OF CITIES
As more people choose to live in cities, CSX is well positioned to serve a growing urban 
population primarily located along the company’s network. With this growth opportunity comes the need for enhanced safety practices around rail crossings and tracks.
CSX works on safety initiatives to raise public awareness of the potential hazards 
of highway-rail grade crossings (where a rail line crosses at the same level as the tracks). The Play It Safe initiative stresses the importance of staying safe around trains and tracks through a marketing and visibility partnership with NASCAR, which helps the company reach wide audiences, including 18 to 34 year-old males, the group most likely to be involved in rail crossing and pedestrian safety incidents.
CSX also supports Operation Lifesaver, a national, non-profit public information 
program dedicated to reducing collisions, injuries, and fatalities at highway-rail crossings and on railroads. Each year, Operation Lifesaver’s network of trained volunteers conducts rail safety education for hundreds of groups around the country. In 2015, CSX employees volunteered 355 hours for safety activities with Operation Lifesaver and shared safety information with more than 237,000 neighbors.
After an incident in South Fulton County, Georgia, involving a public transportation 
bus and train, CSX worked with the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) and Operation Lifesaver to increase bus operator awareness of rail crossing safety and incorporate it into current training and internal communication programs. Since the training started in mid-2015 more than 250 professional bus operators from MARTA have been trained. Additionally, two MARTA bus supervisors have become Operation Lifesaver volunteer trainers.
Ultimately, CSX believes that minimizing the number of opportunities to cross 
the railroad at-grade creates the safest environment for communities. In 2015, CSX also reduced accident risk by closing 132 private and at-grade crossings in partnership with communities. Over the last five years, CSX has closed more than five percent of the railroad’s at-grade crossings.

Safety Is a Way of Life | Live safely for your family. Take time to be safe. Look out 
for each other. Safety affects customers.
One of the largest safety-focused undertakings for CSX in the past decade has been 
the implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC), which can provide long-term benefits to public safety and help prevent accidents by automatically stopping trains that violate certain safety criteria.
PTC implementation was mandated by the U.S. Congress as part of the Rail Safety 
Improvement Act of 2008, requiring railroads to invent a new technology, make it compatible across freight and passenger railroads, and test and implement the technology; all with minimal disruptions to customers and the economy. 
A large and cross-functional team has made great strides to install all hardware by 
2018 and achieve full deployment by 2020, following extensive testing and training.
2015 was pivotal for the project: it was the first year CSX began operating PTC-
equipped trains in revenue service. These Revenue Service Demonstrations signal the start of transition from technology development to implementation. CSX was the second Class I railroad to start Revenue Service Demonstrations.
As of the end of 2015, nearly 12,000 employees have been trained and teams 
have equipped more than 5,000 miles of lines with new signaling equipment; fully equipped more than 1,689 locomotives; partially equipped 2,895 locomotives; and installed more than 2,500 wayside interface units. CSX expects to spend another $300 million on the project in 2016, and a total of about $2.2 billion before the system is complete.

onment & EfficiencyPUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY
The CSX Public Safety Coordination Center (PSCC) is a call center that coordinates 
safety dispatching and response teams 24 hours a day. Reports to the PSCC include railroad emergencies such as blocked crossings, crossing accidents, signal problems, materials release, theft, vandalism, trespassing, or unsafe employee driving. The PSCC team engages directly with local authorities to address issues promptly. In 2015, the PSCC managed 388,896 inbound and outbound phone calls regarding safety and security concerns.
To further promote the safety of the company’s rail network and neighbors, the CSX 
Police work to safeguard personnel, infrastructure, property, and provide security. CSX Police Special Agents, who are located strategically across CSX’s network, are sworn law enforcement professionals who meet rigorous standards and partner with local, state, and federal law enforcement. More information is available on the CSX website here.
CSX’s Infrastructure Protection team complements the resources of the CSX Police by 
focusing on the security threats against the network. These employees work closely with local, state and federal agencies to collaborate and share information on public security matters. As a part of this effort, they have established public-private partnerships to work with federal, state, and local homeland security and emergency management officials, sharing valuable, current information to assist in protecting the communities CSX serves. (G4-DMA Grievance Mechanisms for Impacts on Society, G4-SO11)
INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY
In order to run an efficient, safe railroad, the infrastructure must be maintained and upgraded as needed. Approximately 7,500 employees are dedicated to maintaining critical infrastructure at CSX. In 2015, the company replaced 3.3 
million ties, installed 3 million tons of ballast, and replaced or resurfaced more than 5,500 miles of rails.
There are more than 14,000 bridges along the company’s network. Virtually no two 
bridges are the same, and understanding these unique characteristics is critical to ensuring CSX bridges are safe. CSX maintains its own bridge fabrication shop in Barboursville, West Virginia. CSX also has a bridge management program, which  is compliant with FRA regulations and subject to review by Federal authorities.  The program establishes criteria for evaluating the condition of bridges based

As a common carrier, CSX is required to transport hazardous materials, and the 
company takes the utmost care to transport these materials safely and efficiently. CSX works to accomplish that objective through a comprehensive program of employee training, technology deployment, infrastructure investment, inspection protocols, and dialogue with communities and public officials. CSX guidelines for transporting hazardous materials build on the Association of American Railroads’ published standards of operating practices (Circular No. OT-55), and meet or  exceed federal requirements, including track inspection rates, speeds, and tank  car standards. (G4-SO2)
EMERGENCY PLANNING  
AND RESPONSE
In the event of a rail-related incident, every minute counts, and safety is paramount. That’s why CSX has worked hard to build relationships with first responders and empower them with the skills and knowledge they need. In fact, CSX was one of the first railroads to put together a dedicated hazardous materials response team. Today, the team includes two directors and 10 regional managers across the company’s network to facilitate strong relationships between CSX, local first responders, and emergency management agencies.
The CSX Hazardous Materials Team provided resources and training to more than 7,000 
emergency responders in 2015. The team regularly hosts specialized training programs for state and local responders, including a series of three-day classes for community emergency management coordinators. By the end of 2015, these training sessions had reached 115 coordinators. In addition, the CSX Hazardous Materials Team trained 1,773 first responders at Safety Train events hosted at 20 stops in the U.S. and Canada. CSX also trained 537 contractors, customers, and Short Line Partners.
CSX has also worked to give first responders the information they need in an easily-
accessible format, in near-real time through a mobile application called CSX Rail Respond. The application gives first responders information such as the exact contents of any rail car on a CSX train, along with emergency response information and recommendations for protective action. CSX Rail Respond is free for first responders, and today, nearly 12,000 first responders are enrolled. If you are a first responder, you can request access at www.csxrailrespond.com.
In 2015, CSX had two significant derailments in Mount Carbon, West Virginia and 
Maryville, Tennessee that impacted communities and the environment, and forced evacuations. Zero accidents is the goal, but when derailments and other railroad emergencies do happen, CSX is prepared with significant resources to minimize the impact on communities and the environment. Through a trained group of CSX employees and trusted support organizations, the CSX response is immediate and comprehensive, and CSX personnel remain in affected communities as long as needed. 
CSX’s incident response protocol includes:
 ·Facilitating lodging, meals, animal car
e, and other needs for displaced residents;
 ·Pr
oviding factual and timely information to the public and officials;
 ·W
orking with businesses and schools to minimize disruptions to regular activities;
 ·Pr
oviding timely updates to customers and suppliers;
 ·Monitoring impacts to soil, air
, and water; and
 ·Restoring the envir
onment.
Even after the emergency response is concluded and the initial cleanup is complete, 
CSX continues its dialogue with affected communities. To ensure the company is serving residents’ needs and to better prepare for future incidents, CSX revisits the community within six months for a conversation about response performance and lessons learned.

WORKFORCE SAFETY
Workplace safety is important at all levels and in all tasks. As employees take on 
new roles and react to changes in the business mix, it is even more critical to focus on safe work behaviors. CSX strives to continuously improve its safety culture through training, innovation, and investment, including:
 ·New hir
e and employee training 
 ·Annual job-based training on safety and operating rules
 · Monthly training sessions led by local supervisors and supported by updated  video tutorials
 ·Regularly scheduled train accident pr
evention and safety skills training
 · CPR, AED, and First Aid training (mor
e than one-third of CSX employees are 
currently certified)
There are several governing bodies that regulate employee and operational safety in the rail industry.
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations govern appropriate personal 
actions, safety standards, and equipment. FRA’s personal injury rate measures the number of reportable injuries, per 200,000 man-hours. In 2015, CSX’s FRA personal injury rate improved 5.4 percent year-over-year to 0.93, making it the second lowest personal injury rate across Class I railroads. The reported FRA train accident frequency rate, which tracks train accidents per million train miles, weakened two percent year-over-year from 2.44 to 2.49.* In 2012, CSX also began tracking a new internal injury frequency measurement, the Life Changing Index (LCI), which quantifies the potential severity of an event on a numerical scale from 0-2. By measuring the LCI, managers are armed with valuable information to target behaviors and issues that have the greatest potential risk. (G4-LA6)
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets standards for 
worker safety outside of train operations and track/signal maintenance. CSX’s Industrial Hygiene Team is focused on anticipating, recognizing, evaluating, and controlling these occupational health hazards to promote employee safety. Four additional team members received professional certifications this year, bringing CSX’s total to seven certified safety professionals and four certified industrial hygienists

 making the company the industry leader
. In 2015, the team conducted 167 days’ worth of workplace exposure assessments that included the collection of 876 samples and targeted for 44 different chemicals. (G4-DMA

WORKFORCE DEMOGRAPHICS
CSX has transitioned through a 10 year period of retirements. Baby Boomers now 
make up 25 percent of the management workforce, versus 70 percent in 2005. Today, 
CSX has a nearly balanced composition of Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, and Millennials.
In 2015, as CSX experienced the continued transition to a “multigenerational” 
workforce, the company also experienced changes in the business environment. 
These forces have changed the way that the company is planning for its workforce  
of the future.
CSX is continuing to develop talent to demonstrate technology skills, collaboration, 
customer insight and influence, and analytical excellence. CSX also recognized that 
the workforce needs to be more innovative and flexible, in order to respond to rapidly 
changing markets. The company is investing in more technology-focused work tools 
and strengthening the technology competencies of its employees to drive efficiency 
and productivity.
CSX also continues to evolve its recruitment and retention initiatives to respond to 
its changing workforce. The company prides itself on fostering an inclusive culture 
that celebrates the valuable experiences of those who have served our country. More than 20 percent of CSX employees have served in the U.S. military, and CSX has 
been named a “Top 10 Company for Veterans” by G.I. Jobs Magazine.  CSX also partners with workforce engagement and inclusion organizations such as the U.S. 
Business Leadership Network to share and learn best practices for productive and 
inclusive workplace environments.

At the end of 2015, CSX had 28,878 full-time employees. They hold a variety of 
positions from engineers, conductors, and customer service representatives, to 
information technology project managers and network modeling analysts. Over 
the last year, CSX hired 2,016 employees, 24.6 percent management and 75.4 
percent craft positions. Craft employees currently make up 84 percent of CSX’s 
overall workforce. (G4-10; G4-LA1; G4-DMA Labor/Management Relations)
*As of December 31, 2015. An employee breakdown is on page 82.In 2015, CSX adjusted resource levels to account for lower traffic volumes in some 
areas as a result of challenging business conditions. Some of the reductions took 
place in the headquarters organization to streamline support, mostly through a 
voluntary retirement program. Resources were also reduced at field facilities like 
Corbin, Kentucky, and Erwin, Tennessee, which served the coal market. CSX 
believes in treating employees with dignity and respect, and while the reductions 
were difficult, the company provided transition support and helped employees find 
opportunities in other positions when possible. Craft employees were notified in 
accordance with collective bargaining agreements and state and federal regulations.

As CSX continued the transition to a smaller workforce, the company also re-
examined its talent strategies to refine approaches to the hiring, development, and 
retention of talent. The goal is to ensure that CSX’s development resources meet 
current and future business needs and maximize the ability to grow talent from within 
the company. The examination resulted in several key changes in 2015, including: 
 · Incr
easing resources about career planning, including posting open positions  
more frequently; 
 · Impr
oving online training resources aligned to each leadership level to address 
improved proficiency in analysis and learning agility;
 ·Incr
easing frequency of advanced technical and functional training classes;
 · Requiring 100 per
cent of hiring managers to complete an effective interview 
training; and
 · Planning to intr
oduce unconscious bias seminars in 2016 to improve decision making. 
Skills development and planning takes many forms at CSX. The company uses a 
combination of skills training, coaching, and mentoring. The company provides learning 
opportunities on a 70-20-10 model, which emphasizes practical on-the-job experience as 
70 percent; coaching as 20 percent; and formal instruction making up the last 10 percent.
To support on-the-job training and coaching, CSX employees completed 1,636,008 
hours of skills and compliance training through the company’s online “TrainingTrax” 
system. A full list of ongoing employee training courses and opportunities is available 
on the CSX website here.

ellnessAs CSX realigned overall resources in 2015, the company was able to provide many 
new opportunities for employees. Over the last year, 541 management employees 
transferred to different roles throughout the company to address new and expanded 
business needs. An additional 412 management employees were promoted to new 
positions in response to attrition, and 120 management employees were promoted 
within their current roles to take on more responsibility at CSX.
DIVERSITY AND ENGAGEMENT
CSX’s goals include sustaining a diverse workforce that reflects the communities where 
the company operates, nurturing an inclusive culture, and engaging employees in 
support of the company’s vision. Women and people of color remain a focus of hiring 
efforts (see sidebar for 2015). The company is also focused on hiring and developing employees with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. A full list of CSX’s diversity and inclusion groups, councils, employee resource groups, 
and partnerships is available on the CSX website. (G4-10; G4-DMA Diversity and 
Equal Opportunity; G4-LA12)
 In 2015, CSX participated in the mandatory federal r
equirements for workforce 
disclosure by launching “Count Me In,” an initiative to gain a more complete 
picture of the number of disabilities and veterans represented in the workforce. The 
campaign is providing CSX with high-level data that will support improved diversity, 
inclusion, and engagement programs.
Employees are working hard every day to help build the CSX of Tomorrow. Working safely, serving customers, and achieving business goals are points of pride for CSX 
employees. The company recognizes employees who go the extra mile through 
many formal awards programs. A few examples of award-winning employee 
contributions in 2015 are on the next page.DIVERSITY REPRESENTATION: WOMEN

of excellence in service and safety. In 2015, the Huntington Division won the 
Service Pinnacle Award, which recognizes the best year-long Service Excellence 
measurements. The Mechanical Operating Unit won the Safety Pinnacle Award for 
having the lowest Life Changing Index rate in the company.
 · The Chairman’
s Award of Excellence, celebrates extraordinary achievements 
in the workplace by management employees. In 2015, Chairman’s Award 
honorees were recognized for their efforts to capture new business, identify new 
revenue, expand capacity, improve productivity, advance environmental goals, 
and enhance safety.
CSX recognizes the importance of providing tangible and intangible benefits to 
retain key skills for the future. The company is preparing for formal and informal 
conversations in 2016 with current employees to better identify additional drivers of 
engagement or issues that may yield turnover.
CSX also encourages an engaged community of employee support during times of 
need. The Employees Disaster Relief Fund provides short term financial assistance 
to CSX employees and their dependents after an incident resulting from natural 
disasters, catastrophic illness, or accidental injury. CSX employees can also make 
charitable donations directly to the Fund to build this support system.
When Engagement and Efficiency Align
In 2015, CSX piloted the “Crew Life” mobile application designed for approximately 
12,000 Train & Engine employees. The app provides data for employees to see how 
likely it is that they will be called to work, by viewing train locations and the number of 
employees waiting for the next assignment.
Prior to the app, employees had to check their status by either a phone line or 
a desktop computer. Now, by having instant access to this data in their hands, 
employees have more control to plan the balance between career and personal 
responsibilities. Since CSX began to implement “Crew Life” in December 2014, more 
than 85 percent of eligible employees are using the app on a repeated basis.
“It gives you the ability to go through your normal day without being stuck to a laptop,” 
said James Weiss, CSX employee and Local Chairman for the United Transportation 
Union, C&O District. “It really adds to your quality of life.”HEALTH AND WELLNESS
Because many jobs in transportation require long periods of sedentary work and 
travel away from one’s home, CSX wants to make sure that employees keep a 
healthy lifestyle and get the rest they need in order to safely perform their jobs. The 
company is looking at health from a comprehensive viewpoint, incorporating mental 
and physical wellbeing and quality of life assessments.
Physical health and wellness is an important component of an employee’s 
experience. CSX continues to integrate employee health and wellness programs 
into business operations. The company maintains health and wellness facilities at 45 
worksites to provide easy access for employees. In addition, CSX offers 25 voluntary 
health and wellness programs and access to a team of Licensed Dietitians and 
Health Fitness Specialists.
In 2015, the company offered a “HealthyWage” Challenge, encouraging employees to 
recruit a team of five coworkers and/or family members to all lose weight over a 12-
week period. The challenge included weekly games and giveaways, and more than 
$20,000 in cash and prizes. Five members of the Huntington Locomotive Shop

won the challenge, with a combined weight 
loss of 255 pounds, more than 16.5 percent of their starting weight. Overall, more 
than 750 employees and their family members lost a total of nearly 10,000 pounds in 
connection with these programs.
CSX also has an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides counseling, relief, 
guidance, and referral services to help employees and their families manage personal 
and work-related stress and incidents. EAP professionals are located around the 
network, and additional counselors are available through a 24-hour toll-free phone line. 
Services provided by CSX EAP are at no cost to the employee or family members. The 
EAP also helps implement CSX’s comprehensive “Critical Incident Response Plan” to 
support the employees who are directly affected by these traumatic events.

About This Report  TREND IN CONTEXT:  
WEATHER VARIABILITY
As the population in CSX’s service territory grows, catastrophic weather events 
such as hurricanes and flooding have an increasing impact on communities and 
rail operations. CSX’s operations and public safety departments play critical roles in 
weather event preparedness, from performing preventative maintenance that limit 
service disruptions for customers, to forming relationships with first responders 
and sharing resources with communities in need. CSX also continues to evolve its 
weather response playbooks, tailoring an approach specific to each area of the 
network and maintaining response teams to deploy when critical conditions arise.
In addition to planning and preparing for weather-resilient operations, CSX supports 
business practices and organizations that minimize environmental impact and even 
enhance the quality of the air, water, and land. CSX continues its work to improve fuel 
efficiency, as fuel accounts for the largest percentage of the company’s greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. In 2012, CSX set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions intensity by 6 to 8 percent by 2020. CSX is making progress against this 
goal, and from 2011 to 2015, CSX reduced GHG emissions intensity by 2.5 percent 
thanks primarily to investments in technologies that drive fuel efficiency and people 
who enable technology in operations. (G4-EC2)
CSX has also established strategic partnership with national and regional 
organizations that aim to protect and preserve the environment for communities 
along the company’s network, such as The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and The Arbor Day Foundation. These organizations are involved in major restoration 
projects of forests and rivers in the communities CSX serves. For more information 
on CSX’s environmental partnerships, see Communities.

CSX strives for continuous impr
ovement in environmental management by using  
data to design advanced processes and protocols. Raghu Chatrathi, the director of 
environmental remediation, engineering, and advanced technology applies this data 
to track progress and find solutions.
In 2015, Chatrathi was recognized with the North American Environmental Employee 
Excellence Award, the highest honor for rail industry environmental professionals 
from the Association of American Railroads. Among a number of significant 
accomplishments in environmental remediation, sustainability, and compliance 
programs over the years, Chatrathi has used data and facts to:
 · Conduct a system-wide study of r
enewable energy use, the results of which led to 
a solar energy project that saved the CO2 emissions equivalent of burning 4,000 
gallons of diesel fuel each year;
 · Develop formulas behind the rail industry’
s first Carbon Calculator, an online tool 
that calculates the emissions avoided by converting shipments to rail; 
 · Establish envir
onmental protocols for CSX’s “Rails-to-Trails” conversion program, 
including directly working on 150 miles of community trails; and
 · Upgrade the company-wide electr
onic environmental management system.
“Raghu’s ability to turn challenging problems into process-driven solutions and his 
unfailing commitment to constant improvement lead his colleagues to higher and 
higher measures of success – and ultimately help CSX minimize its environmental 
footprint,” said Skip Elliott, vice president of public safety, health, and environment.

About This Report  FUEL USE AND EFFICIENCY
Fuel efficiency benefits CSX’s business, CSX customers, and the environment. 
In 2015, CSX invested more than $633 million in upgrades, improvements, and 
solutions that helped to improve fuel efficiency, mostly on the purchase of state-of-
the-art locomotives. These efforts included using:
 · T
rip Optimizer, which gives crews the ability to help minimize fuel output by 
planning the route ahead of time and looking for opportunities for fuel efficiencies;
 · T
railing unit shut down, or the optimization of locomotive horsepower by turning off 
the power of non-lead locomotives when not in use; and
 · T
ier 4 locomotives that reduce nitrous oxides and particulate emissions by at least 
70 percent from Tier 3 standards and follow new regulatory requirements set by 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Since 1980, fuel efficiency improved by more than 100 percent. CSX continues to 
invest in progress, putting more than $2.4 billion into fuel-efficient technology over 
the last decade. Challenges in 2015 caused fuel efficiency to decrease from the 
ability to move a ton of freight 483 miles on a single gallon of fuel to 471 miles on 
a gallon. This slight decrease in overall efficiency was impacted by many factors, 
including the shift from heavy coal shipments to lighter intermodal trains. Weight, 
speed, and network fluidity all impact the number of miles that one ton of freight can 
move on a single gallon of fuel.
On average, a typical CSX freight train is four times more fuel-efficient than highway 
freight transportation, and an intermodal train can carry the cargo load of 280 trucks. 
CSX emphasizes the fuel efficiency of rail compared to highway transportation as 
one of the benefits that customers enjoy. CSX’s Highway-to-Rail conversion program converted 51,279 loads from highway transportation to rail in 2015 and nearly 
150,000 loads since the program’s start in 2013. 
(G4-DMA Energy; G4-EN7; G4-EN19; G4-DMA Products and Services; G4-EN27)LAND AND FACILITIES
CSX employees are committed to continuing the company’s legacy of responsible 
remediation. In 2015, CSX completed remediation construction on the Nocatee 
Hull Creosote site in Hull, FL. Since the start of the construction in November 2013, 
CSX restored 3 acres of wetlands by improving biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and 
habitat for wildlife.
In 2015, CSX opened Casky Yard in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, the company’s first 
new transportation rail yard in nearly 40 years. From the beginning, CSX set out to 
incorporate modern systems that minimize the environmental impact of the facility. 
For example, Casky Yard includes specially designed stormwater ponds, uniquely 
constructed fuel truck areas, and three oil-water separators that are equipped 
with remote monitoring systems. The office building design and construction was 
informed by LEED standards. 
(G4-DMA Biodiversity; G4-EN13)
WASTE MANAGEMENT
CSX employees minimize waste by using resources efficiently and by implementing 
various recycling programs. CSX diverted 63 percent of hazardous waste and 95 
percent of nonhazardous waste from landfills. By the end of 2015, the company 
successfully decreased hazardous waste generator status at 24 percent of facilities, 
making progress towards its goal of a 25 percent decrease by 2020. To encourage 
these reductions, CSX held employee training that focused on both federal and state 
standards around the proper handling of materials and the importance of reducing 
and recycling materials whenever possible. (G4-DMA Effluents and Waste)
WATER USE
In 2015, CSX reduced its water consumption by 7.3 percent from the prior year. This 
reduction was informed by insights from CSX’s water risk evaluation conducted in 
2013, which identified areas in the network with water vulnerability. Since that time, 
CSX has invested in projects and technologies that save water, including improving 
wastewater treatment facilities and rainwater harvesting efforts, among other practices.54

About This Report   · Over the past year , CSX connected more locations to the centralized water 
management system that allows for remote monitoring and control of wastewater 
treatment facilities. The company currently has 34 facilities with this technology, 
bringing it closer to its goal of 46 facilities
 —
 or nearly 75 per

 · New wastewater tr
eatment facilities and upgrades in New Orleans, Louisiana; 
Montgomery, Alabama; and Clifton Forge, Virginia, enabled CSX to reduce energy 
consumption, improve reliability, monitor process equipment, and permit remote 
access and control. Some of the efficiencies in the new system include:

INFLUENCING THE VALUE CHAIN
The company is still in the early stages of measuring its Scope 3 emissions within the 
supply chain. For a second year, CSX used the World Resources Institute and World 
Business Council on Sustainable Development GHG Protocol Scope 3 Evaluator 
Tool and annual spend on capital and purchased goods to estimate roughly 3 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from these sources.
In 2015, CSX collected additional data and information from 80 suppliers through 
CDP . The CDP Supply Chain program provides a platform for CSX to gather 
business-critical environmental data from key suppliers, and thereby better measure 
climate impacts and risks within the company’s supply chain. It also helps CSX 
and suppliers collaborate on sustainability programs throughout the year. (G4-DMA

CULTURE OF COLLABORATION
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, more than 23 million 
Americans have limited access to fresh food, in part due to lack of access to 
food sources and growers’ inability to get their products to market. Transporting 
agricultural and food-service products is an important part of CSX’s business. Yet, for 
far too many Americans, getting access to fresh, healthy food is a constant struggle.
CSX began working with The Conservation Fund in 2007, and in 2014, the 
partnership focused its efforts on improving access to healthy food in areas known 
as food deserts along the CSX network. This partnership leverages the Fund and 
CSX’s respective strengths: the Fund’s mission to redefine conservation and support 
healthy, vibrant communities by building deep relationships with regional and local 
food organizations and farmers paired with CSX’s understanding of transportation 
and infrastructure in driving social and economic stability.
In 2014, the partnership created a micro-grants program designed to improve 
resources devoted to transporting, storing, packaging, and distributing fresh food 
and produce. CSX and the Fund also supported farmers markets in West Virginia 
counties that have been identified as areas of need.
In just two years, the grant funding is projected to enable recipient organizations to 
collectively serve an additional 150,000 families with more than 9 million pounds of 
food and increase the number of meals provided by 4.5 million.
“Through our partnership with CSX, we are able to provide a lifeline to Americans 
who struggle to make fresh food a part of their daily meals,” said Katie Allen, Director 
of The Conservation Fund’s Conservation Leadership Network. “Together we’re connecting vulnerable populations to healthy food by expanding and improving the 
local transportation and storage of produce and meats from nearby farms to local 
food distribution centers and farm markets; sustaining and supporting a viable food 
system for millions of people.”

Right Results, Right Way | Reward our shareholders. Be a positive influence on 
communities and the environment. How you get there matters. Avoid fault-fixing.
Years of experience have informed and transformed how CSX works with partners 
to address community issues. Today, CSX focuses many of its resources with major 
national partners who can extend programs across the network, supplemented by 
targeted local grants distributed by regional council employees.
One partnership that has grown over the last two decades is CSX’s work with City Year, 
which began in 1995. At that point, City Year had around 1,000 Corps Members and nearly 
1,500 alumni. After CSX employees walked by a City Year “Opening Day” event, where 
City Year AmeriCorps members take their pledge to serve the community that year, the 
company decided to sponsor two teams of Corps members in Boston and Cleveland. CSX 
noticed how working with City Year would help the company support students in urban, 
population-dense communities in the Eastern U.S.
 —
 the very communities that the CSX
 
network connects
 —
 and build the next generation of leaders.
T
oday, CSX is City Year’s largest corporate partner, sponsoring more than 150 Corps 
Members on 15 teams across 13 cities, who are serving nearly 7,000 students in 
high-need schools. City Year currently has more than 3,000 City Year AmeriCorps 
members and 25,000 alumni. CSX has also supported City Year’s recruitment strategies by sponsoring the launch of a database to better manage candidates which provided 
critical infrastructure for the team. With CSX’s support, City Year increased the number of applications in 2015 and overall Corps numbers increased by six percent.
City Year has also helped CSX employees find opportunities to give back to the 
communities where they live and work through organized service events hosted by the 
City Year Care Force Team. Since 2003, CSX and Care Force have engaged more than 
15,800 CSX employees, partners, and community members in nearly 87,000 hours of 
service at events across 53 communities.
“Throughout our partnership of more than 21 years, it is clear that CSX is a company 
that truly lives its values through a steadfast commitment to strengthening the 
communities the company serves,” said City Year CEO and Co-Founder Michael 
Brown. “CSX’s generous investment will continue to support City Year’s efforts to 
recruit highly-talented, idealistic young adults to invest a year of service in high-need, 
urban schools, as well as engage thousands of CSX employees in service days to 
transform neighborhoods and communities.”

EmployeesEnvironment & EfficiencyTRANSPARENCY AND ENGAGEMENT
Because the company operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week across 
a large network, CSX maintains a team of community affairs specialists who 
promote safety and track local issues and opportunities. These regional 
colleagues organize safety events, attend public meetings, follow up on local 
questions, and more.
As a part of that team, CSX created and manages a TellCSX phone and email 
system, staffed by community affairs specialists. Community members can 
contact TellCSX regarding any company topics, from issues with horn noise to 
awareness of a local community event near rail property. Reported topics are 
shared with relevant departments for a prompt response. The TellCSX team has 
seen a shift in communications to more digital platforms like email that allow 
community members to submit more detailed information, including photos and 
videos. In 2015, more than 79,000 web-forms and emails and 29,000 phone 
calls were submitted to TellCSX. The most common call topics were related 
to railroad crossings. More information about how CSX engages community 
stakeholders is in About This Report. (G4-DMA Grievance Mechanisms for

· What’s NextCOMMUNITY INVESTMENT AND 
PHILANTHROPY
CSX’s community investment strategy aligns with the Core Values and translates into 
support for four focus areas that address real societal needs: Safety, Community, 
Environment, and Wellness. In 2015, CSX invested more than $13.5 million in grants 
and in-kind donations. More than half of the company’s philanthropic support went to 
its major national partners, which each run distinct, tailored programming to support 
communities. (G4-EC1; G4-DMA Local Communities) 
Safety: Because of the nature of the CSX business, safety is at the core of community 
programming. CSX works relentlessly to prevent injuries and accidents through 
education, outreach, and advocacy at all levels.
 · National Safe Place assists with immediate help and supportive r
esources for youth 
in need. CSX provides National Safe Place volunteer service, program funding, and 
leadership support.
Community: The CSX network serves nearly two-thirds of the American population, 
which means there are 21,000 miles of neighbors the company aims to support.
 · For 20 years, CSX has supported the American Red Cr
oss as part of the company’s 
commitment to creating resilient communities. CSX supports the organization’s 
efforts to alleviate disaster-related suffering and foster recovery.
 · FF
A, the largest youth service organization in the country, provides leadership and 
community service opportunities for more than 610,000 student members through 
agricultural education. CSX sponsors FFA Chapter Leadership programs in 22 states, 
helps develop curriculum, and offers leadership scholarships in each of its divisions.
Environment: CSX recognizes the importance of preserving the environment now 
and for the generations that follow.
 · The National Fish and W
ildlife Foundation (NFWF) uses private and public grant 
matching to help local communities clean up and restore polluted rivers and 
streams in the Chesapeake Bay region. Since 2013, NFWF has implemented 
2,000 acres of farmland conservation practices for improved water quality.
 · The Arbor Day Foundation’
s mission is to “inspire people to plant, nurture, and 
celebrate trees,” promoting urban and community tree planting across the U.S. CSX partners with the organization for the Trees for Tracks program, through which CSX employees and community volunteers planted 3,566 trees in 2015. Since 
2009, a total of 29,749 trees have been planted toward the company’s goal of 
42,000 trees
 —
 two for every mile of CSX track.
 (G4-EN13; G4-EN27)
Wellness: Improved transportation access can play an important role in the health of 
communities. CSX is focused on using transportation expertise to address hunger by 
reducing the number of nutritional food deserts and developing the next generation 
of healthy citizens.
 · Since 2013, CSX has joined for
ces with Action for Healthy Kids to increase the 
number of kids becoming physically active, which is a catalyst for improving 
community health. Partner schools in AFHK and CSX’s How Tomorrow Moves: 
Active Kids Campaign have increased the amount of daily active time for students 
by 41 percent on average.
CSX also uses its resources and expertise to help nonprofit organizations reduce 
or eliminate their transportation spending. CSX frequently provides intermodal 
equipment and rail service to help an organization move its products to areas of high 
demand. Feeding Northeast Florida was one of the organizations that CSX worked 
with in 2015, logging 21 moves of nonperishable foods at a value of approximately 
$32,000. (G4-EC8)62

AND GIVING
In 2015, 971 volunteers from the CSX workforce and its community, supplier, 
and nonprofit partners logged 22,214 volunteer hours. These acts of service 
occurred across 125 different communities, showing the reach of the CSX 
network. In addition, through the combination of donations and matching 
programs, CSX employees raised $855,006 in workplace giving funds for 
nonprofits in 2015.
CSX supports employee volunteering, philanthropy, and service with both 
corporate contributions and the CSX Foundation through a number of programs:
 · 
Service Days are CSX-sponsored events hosted each year throughout the 
network in collaboration with national nonprofit partners. The events bring 
employees and their families, community members, and the public to advance 
CSX’s core focus areas “Beyond Our Rails.”
 · 
The Team Service program creates team-building opportunities where five or 
more employees can select a charity and lead their own volunteer event.
 · 
The Dollars for Doers program, funded through the CSX Foundation, 
contributes $10 to match every employee volunteer service hour logged at 
nonprofit organizations. Employees can choose which organization they’d like 
to individually support with their earned grant.
 · 
The Board Service program encourages employees in the position of director 
and above to contribute their time on the boards of directors of nonprofit 
charities, which also includes a grant from the CSX Foundation.
 · 
The Employee Disaster Relief Fund gives employees an opportunity to 
support colleagues in times of need through a grant donation. In 2015, CSX 
awarded 24 grants from its Employee Disaster Relief Fund for a total of $171,000.
To capture all of the company’s initiatives and efforts in one place and recognize 
the individuals and organizations contributing to positive change in CSX 
communities, CSX launched #LocalMotive, an ongoing digital conversation. 
#LocalMotive highlights examples of CSX’s presence in communities through 
service and volunteerism, job creation, infrastructure investments, and moving essential goods  —  all on a digital hub that aggr egates content from different 
social media networks. Check out #LocalMotive online here.
WHAT’S NEXT
The future of community giving, development, and engagement at CSX includes 
plans for many exciting projects. The common thread among these plans is close 
collaboration with communities, schools, and local nonprofit organizations.
One of these projects is already underway. Baybrook Park is a development project 
led by the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation in partnership with the City of Baltimore and 
other organizations like CSX to build a Youth Development Park in the Curtis Bay 
area. Plans for Baybrook Park include a state-of-the-art, multi-purpose youth sports 
facility to benefit the community and the students at nearby Ben Franklin High School, 
which has moved from one of the city’s lowest performing high schools in 2011 to a 
current top choice high school.

MATERIALITY GUIDE
In line with the GRI’s G4 requirements, CSX’s 2015 materiality assessment asked 
stakeholders to identify and prioritize the issues they found as most critical to CSX’s business. The company prioritized 29 issues that drive the business, defined by GRI as “material issues,” which can be categorized into seven larger topic areas: community; customers and markets; economic; environment; governance and strategy; operations and infrastructure; and people.
The report also includes many disclosures that were not identified as the most material 
issues in 2015. Issues such as health and wellness in the workforce, water, responsible supply chain, land management, and remediation are all actively managed and integral to continued safe and sustainable operations; this year’s report reflects this and aims to include information disclosed and validated by ESG ratings and ranking systems, such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the Carbon Disclosure Project.
The results of the materiality assessment guided the structure and content of this 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report. The top “material issues” were matched with the “material aspects” defined by GRI’s G4 requirements, as outlined in the following pages. This chart identifies the relevant section of the report where each issue is addressed. Some issues impact many different areas of CSX’s business; and therefore, they are mentioned in multiple sections. These issues were also used for the 2014 CSR Report process and materiality guide.

REVIEW REPORT
To the management of CSX Corporation:
We have reviewed the materiality assessment (the “Subject Matter”) included in the 
accompanying schedule (the “Schedule”) and as presented in CSX Corporation’s 2015 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report (the “Report”) for the period March 1, 2015 to February 29, 2016 in accordance with CSX Corporation’s criteria set forth in the schedule (the “Criteria”). We did not review all information included in the Report. We did not review the narrative sections of the Report, except where they incorporated the Subject Matter. CSX Corporation’s management is responsible for the Subject Matter included in the accompanying schedule and as also presented in the Report, based on the Criteria set forth in the schedule. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.
Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  Those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria. A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the materiality assessment is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. A review also does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.  
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made 
to the materiality assessment for the period March 1, 2015 to February 29, 2016, in order for it be in accordance with the Criteria set forth in the schedule. 
June 10, 2016Schedule of Subject Matter  
and Criteria
Indicator Name Assertion
Materiality assessmentFrom March 1, 2015 to February 29, 2016, CSX 
conducted an assessment to identify material issues. That assessment included the criteria referenced below:
Criteria
1
 · Material issues reported in CSX’s 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report were used for the 2015 CSR Report materiality assessment (refer to About This Report for 2014 and 2015 issues list)
 · CSX established eight internal and external stakeholder groups and identified stakeholders within each group to survey, including: 
 · Employees, Customers, Suppliers, Nonpr
ofit Organizations, Government Organizations, Short 
Line Partners, Community Members, Investors
 · CSX prepared an online survey containing the material issues list and received survey responses from more than 100 internal and external stakeholders  
 · The survey asked stakeholders to rate issues on a 1 to 10 scale, with 1 being Not Important and 10 being V
ery Important to the long-term success of CSX’s business
 · CSX weighted the customer and supplier responses to allow for comparability year over year between 2014 and 2015. This weighting resulted in customer response ratings for each issue in the survey being multiplied by 1.61 and supplier response ratings for each issue in the survey being multiplied by 0.67
 · Material issues were ranked based on the weighted average ratings of all stakeholder survey responses and the top 20 issues are presented in the materiality matrix
 · CSX conducted interviews and focus groups with Employees, Customers, Suppliers, and Nonprofit Organizations to document additional insights regarding select material issues included in the 2015 materiality matrix

2015 GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY
Statement of Verification
7.1 Scope
CH2M performed a verification of CSX’s 2015 GHG emission inventory to determine if 
a reasonable level of assurance could be provided. CSX’s management is responsible for the collection and presentation of the information within the 2015 EI. CH2M’s responsibility is to express a conclusion as to whether anything has been identified to suggest that the reported emission inventory is not presented fairly in accordance with referenced GHG accounting principles and associated guidance documents.
7.2 Methodology
Our verification review was completed in accordance with ISO 14064-3:2006[E] section 
4.4. As such, CH2M planned and performed the verification activities in order to provide a reasonable assurance with respect to GHG emission intensity information reviewed.
7.3 GHG Assertions
CSX asserts that their total annual Scope 1, Scope 2, and listed Scope 3 emissions 
for the 2015 reporting period (exclusive of purchased goods and services and capital goods) is 5,910,060 metric tonnes CO2e.
7.4 Conclusion
Based on the verification review conducted, the GHG Scope 1, Scope 2, and listed Scope 
3 (exclusive of purchased goods and services and capital goods) assertions in CSX’s 2015 EI are materially correct and presented fairly in accordance with stated criteria.
