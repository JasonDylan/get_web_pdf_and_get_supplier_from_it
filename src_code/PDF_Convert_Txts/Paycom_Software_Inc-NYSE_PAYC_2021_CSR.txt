FROM THE CEO:  FOCUSING ON THE RIGHT THINGS.
Our culture is built on challenging the status quo and leading with grit, while 
at the same time fostering a safe and inclusive environment. These attributes 
hold true whether we are serving our clients, employees, shareholders or the 
communities where we live and work.
For nearly 25 years, we have been simplifying lives of businesses and their 
employees by giving them easy-to-use software that empowers transparency 
and direct access to data.
While our core business consists of being a leading provider of cloud-based 
human capital management (“HCM”) software and providing world-class 
service for our clients, our organization is also firmly dedicated to creating a 
safe and inclusive workplace, giving back to the community and minimizing 
our impact on the environment. We remain dedicated to focusing on these core 
initiatives for many years to come. 
Employee well-being 
As our most important asset, we are committed to providing our 
co-workers with a safe and engaging environment. I believe it is 
important everyone has the opportunity to exercise their minds just 
as they would their bodies, which is why we offer extensive mental 
wellness benefits and opportunities for our teams to meet with career 
coaches and utilize our counseling services and workplace well-being 
advisors.
While these are just a few examples of the level of care we provide for 
our teammates, we also offer several opportunities for them to focus 
on their physical, mental and financial wellness, ensuring they are 
their best selves at home and in the office.
Diversity, inclusion and belonging 
We are committed to recruiting, developing and retaining top talent, 
and we value a diverse lens across our organization. We hire and 
promote those who possess diverse backgrounds and are proud 
that nearly half of our executive and senior level officials and 
managers are women as we continue to advance gender equality. By 
intentionally hiring the best and most qualified individuals, we ensure 
our clients have the most talented people working on their behalf.
To create an opportunity for our employees to build relationships and 
contribute to an equitable environment at Paycom, we launched our 
Better Conversations series. Throughout this program, we encourage 
open dialogue among colleagues to further promote a culture of 
inclusion and belonging. We have had guest speakers share varying 
perspectives during Pride Month, Women’s History Month, Hispanic 
Heritage Month, Disability Awareness Month and others.
Through our software, we are also empowering businesses to educate 
their staff on diversity and inclusion. We added courses to our 
learning management technology that cover important topics like 
fostering inclusion, inclusive leadership, hiring diverse talent and 
much more.
Our commitment to developing workforces across the country and 
our own organization extends through product training, continued 
education offerings and leadership development programs at every 
level, which helps us perform at our best every day.Philanthropy
Investing in our community is at the forefront of our culture, and we 
reached new heights in our corporate and employee-led contributions. 
We supported a variety of nonprofits, including those that have a big 
impact on diversity and inclusion efforts, underserved communities 
and the environment. I’m proud of our combined contributions to 
groups such as Water4, The Salvation Army, The Boys & Girls Club and 
PADI Aware, just to name a few. We also supported the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre Centennial Commission’s Greenwood Rising History Center, 
which opened in 2021. 
Paycom and our co-workers are more involved than ever in supporting 
programs that ensure everyone has the resources they need for a 
brighter tomorrow. We have a gifted and purposeful team that leaves 
a lasting impact on those in need and strives to do the most possible 
good. I am excited to see what more we will accomplish through our 
giving in the future.
Environmental impact
Protecting our planet and minimizing our environmental impact 
is important. While our cloud-based technology helps our clients 
reduce carbon footprints, we have also implemented several new 
corporatewide initiatives, such as installing electric vehicle charging 
stations at our Oklahoma corporate campus and using recyclable and 
compostable dining materials. In 2021, we switched to 100% renewable 
energy at both our Oklahoma City and Texas corporate campuses.
We are proud of the collective impact we are making on the world and all 
we have added to help create a better future for generations to come.Looking forward 
Just as we have done throughout our history, we are committed 
to doing the right things and working toward a better future. Our 
Corporate Social Responsibility report shows our journey and 
leadership across our organization and communities. The success of 
Paycom is the sum of everyone’s efforts and commitment to these 
initiatives. It takes welcoming diverse thoughts and opinions for us to 
continue winning at the rate we are. For nearly a quarter of a century, 
we have focused on these tangible initiatives, but know we still have 
much more to accomplish. I look forward to leading our organization 
in doing our part to make a positive impact, and I am optimistic about 
what the future holds.

ABOUT PAYCOM
Since 1998, Paycom has been committed to redefining HR and 
payroll technology for a new era of digital convenience. In the 
process, we’ve changed the way employees engage with their 
organizations’ HR department.
Paycom’s single software encompasses an ever-evolving lineup of 
digital tools and eliminates the need to integrate, update or access 
multiple databases, all while providing real-time return on investment 
for HR tech. By empowering employees with direct access to their 
own data, Paycom helps free HR professionals to focus less on time-
consuming tasks and more on serving as strategic partners.On April 15, 2014, Paycom was listed on the New York Stock Exchange 
under the ticker symbol PAYC. For four consecutive years, Paycom 
was named one of the fastest-growing publicly traded companies in 
the world by Fortune magazine. In early 2020, the company joined the 
S&P 500, and in 2021, we continued to see rapid growth. Paycom is 
not only a company on the move, but one leading the way.
Welcome to the digital 
transformation of HR.

 9With Paycom’s end-to-end human capital management solution, the 
entire employee life cycle flows seamlessly through a single solution. 
Employee data lives securely in one database, accessible anywhere 
and anytime. Using our industry-first Direct Data Exchange®, 
leaders and HR professionals can reduce administrative burdens 
and redundant efforts while enhancing employee development, 
organizational efficiency, overall accuracy and their ability to focus 
on more strategic initiatives. Furthermore, our solution enriches 
the user experience and empowers our employees and our clients’ 
employees by providing easy access to their own information, 
benefits portal, payroll and development tools such as learning 
courses and performance reviews.    
While we released nearly 2,000 product enhancements in 2021, 
two product releases stood out:
Beti®
With Beti, employees do their own payroll. Beti builds and manages 
each payroll cycle automatically, identifies errors and guides 
employees to resolve them before submission. Employees have 
the opportunity to ensure their paycheck is correct before payday, 
empowering them to consistently own and manage their own HR data. 
Beti gives employees:
 »full insight into paychecks, including advanced knowledge of   
 take-home pay
 »a direct connection to resolve errors before payday so they don’t  
 have to wait for assistance
 »clarity on how their pay changes and is calculated
 »visualization of deductions, expenses and other allocations
 »automatic alerts when items require further action so they won’t  
  miss a deadline
 »confidence in their paychecks’ accuracy, which can help
 increase engagement and retentionClue™
In response to COVID-19 and other potential health challenges, we 
added enhanced document management and custom fields into file 
forms in the Paycom program. While this provided the necessary 
capabilities to track health-related employee data, we identified the 
need for a more comprehensive tool and created Clue. The tool clues 
employers in on their workforce’s vaccination and testing statuses by 
securely collecting, tracking and managing this important data, all in 
Paycom’s single software.After three easy, one-time steps, all scheduled payroll begins 
automatically. Beti seamlessly pulls live data on employees’ hours 
worked, approved expenses and compensation changes. For HR, at 
the same time, Beti pulls pending tasks and who needs to act on them, 
new terminations, retroactive pay still outstanding and adjustments 
in checks, then notifies personnel when payroll is submission-ready. 
Beti reduces employer liability and increases employee autonomy, 
which is why it was named a Top HR Product of 2021 by Human 
Resource Executive magazine.Employees can quickly and easily enter information, receive 
reminders of weekly tests, upload vaccination records or test 
results and provide data securely and confidentially without direct 
conversations. In turn, employers benefit from the ability to be 
informed with comprehensive and audit-ready insight. Employers 
can monitor and analyze results in one dashboard, view real-time 
vaccination percentages of their workforce and access robust 
analytics and customizable reports. OUR SOLUTION

Corporate Governance

guidelines to form the framework of corporate governance that fosters a culture of ethics and integrity. 
Board of Directors
The board of directors is responsible for oversight of the business and affairs at Paycom. Our board believes that the current composition and 
leadership structure promotes decisive leadership, fosters clear accountability and enhances our ability to communicate our strategy clearly and 
consistently to our stockholders, employees, clients and other stakeholders.

ESG Oversight
We believe that we have a responsibility to our people, our community and the world in which we operate and that effective management 
of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues will help drive long-term growth. Because of this belief, the board delegated formal 
oversight of ESG programs and policies to its N&CG committee with additional topics also reviewed by other committees as needed. Management 
provides formal ESG updates to the N&CG committee on a regular basis. 
Our ESG steering committee is a cross-functional group of leaders throughout the company that assists the CEO and board of directors in

Risk Management 
Our board of directors is responsible for overseeing the conduct of our business and the company’s risk management strategy and activities as a 
whole and at the committee level. Senior management is responsible for assessing, implementing and managing our risk management processes 
on a day-to-day basis and assisting and reporting to the board and its committees.
Ethics and Compliance
We are committed to honesty, just management, fairness and providing a respectful, safe and healthy environment. As we challenge the status 
quo and pursue our revolutionary vision, we realize ethics and compliance are critical to the success of our employees and our business. 
In pursuit of these commitments, we have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to and is signed by all of our employees, 
officers and directors annually. We have also adopted a Whistleblower Policy. Our ethics and compliance programs are ultimately overseen by 
Paycom’s board of directors, with certain responsibilities delegated to board committees, the executive vice president and general counsel and 
other members of senior management. 
Public Policy and Government Relations
Paycom actively monitors public policy and relevant legislation pertinent to our business practices throughout the jurisdictions in which we 
operate. We work to educate policymakers and advocate to advance the interests and goals of our employees, clients and company.
We also engage with trade associations to help us work collaboratively with industry partners to promote our public policy interests and business 
goals. In 2021, Paycom did not contribute to any political candidate, party or government. We also do not maintain a political action committee.16 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 17
Data Governance 
Paycom’s single-database software employs comprehensive, in-depth and industry-proven standards and technologies to protect and defend 
client data and its privacy in our environment. As one of the few payroll processors to maintain accordance with SOC-1 and SOC-2 reports as well 
as certificates outlining compliance with the ISO 27001, ISO 27701, ISO 9001 and ISO 22301 standards, Paycom’s information security, privacy and 
quality management systems are formally reviewed and audited at least annually.
Paycom has developed a governance structure for our privacy program that addresses data privacy and security at every level of our 
organization. The audit committee of the board of directors oversees data privacy and security, including compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements, and reports to the full board regularly. The chief information officer is responsible for ensuring that data privacy and security 
programs are effective and consistent; providing feedback to the audit committee on IT operations; conformity to and development of program 
policies, procedures and guidelines; enterprise data governance; and companywide IT compliance.
Data Security
At Paycom, we take our responsibility to keep client data secure seriously and consider it a top priority. We deploy stringent security measures 
to safeguard client data at organizational, operational and infrastructure levels. This includes robust data encryption; secured, monitored and 
redundant data centers with full battery and generator power; and a 24/7/365 security command center. 
Business continuity and disaster recovery testing is part of our ISO 27001 and ISO 22301 certifications. We perform disaster recovery testing 
monthly and full failover testing annually. In addition, we replicate client data live to our failover data center with the goal of clients maintaining 
access to their data at all times.
Data Privacy
Our commitment to protecting our clients’ data is at the core of our business. Our privacy program follows guidelines to meet or exceed industry 
standard practices concerning access to and the use and disclosure of client information. Features include IP filtering for time clocks and direct 
deposit changes, security and verification questions, and enhanced password requirements for all users of the Paycom system. To ensure we are 
upholding our privacy practices to the best of our ability, we also deploy mandatory training on privacy and data protection to all employees on 
an annual basis.

OUR PEOPLE
An Inclusive Environment
At Paycom, we support diversity, inclusion and belonging. We have zero tolerance for racism, harassment or discrimination and have 
demonstrated that as an organization. Still, we understand there is much more work to do. We encourage every one of our team members to form 
deeper relationships with those around them based on mutual respect, dignity and understanding.
Paycom’s goals for inclusion and diversity are to ensure that we: 
 »make employees feel heard, valued and appreciated for who they are
 »foster a work environment where employees feel safe to share their story
 »encourage diversity of thought through open dialogue and engagement
 »build and retain a more diverse workforce at all employee levels through recruitment and continuous development
 »identify opportunities to strengthen the communities where we live and work
Our hope is for our entire workforce to do its part to combat bias and divisiveness, as individuals and as an organization.Workforce Initiatives 
Paycom appreciates and values diversity of thought, and we recognize that the best way to understand and be understood is by leveraging our 
most valuable asset: our people. To encourage productive conversations, foster a more inclusive workplace and provide a forum for open and 
honest dialogue, we launched an employee listening and engagement series called Better Conversations.
The series aims to cover topics that are most relevant and important to our employees, such as diversity, inclusion and belonging; working 
parents; mental wellness; women in tech; and more, as well as special sessions for Disability Awareness, Black History, Hispanic Heritage, Native 
American Heritage and Pride Months. The sessions are open to everyone, presenting an opportunity to listen, increase allyship and have our voices heard. 
To date, we have hosted over 100 Better Conversations sessions with over 3,100 participants, including all Paycom leaders.
In 2021, Paycom received the Learning in Practice Innovation award for the series, presented by Chief Learning Officer® magazine.
Education Collection
To help our clients foster productive conversations of their own, we added a collection of diversity and inclusion courses to our digital platform, 
the Paycom Learning application. The collection includes key topics such as bias, fostering inclusion, inclusive leadership, hiring diverse talent 
and more. In addition to offering this educational tool to our clients, Paycom has incorporated diversity and inclusion courses as part of our own 
employee learning experience, including those listed above and mandatory annual discrimination and harassment training.With clear vision and purpose, we will:
 »add an additional senior level manager  
  to our DI&B program under the guidance  
  and supervision of our VP of HR and HR  
  senior leaders
 »help elevate and evolve our program and  
  outcomes
 »continue to communicate our strategy to  
  all stakeholdersThrough collaboration, advocacy and 
senior-level sponsorship, we will:
 »evolve our DI&B committees into a more  
  formalized leadership steering committee  
  and employee advisory council
 »commit to leadership accountability for  
  outcomes that drive our organizational  
  growthWe will drive positive employee 
engagement through:
 »regular celebration, awareness   
  campaigns and personal stories 
 »education and training for all employees 
 »continuing Better Conversations listening  
  and engagement sessions
We foster a work environment where employees feel 
safe to share their story.
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging
In 2021, we created a robust diversity, inclusion and belonging (“DI&B”) strategy to help strengthen our culture, drive innovation and enhance the 
employee experience. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT20 21
Diversity at Paycom

candidates to the board of directors. 
As of December 31, 2021, women represented 51.3% and ethnic minorities represented 33.6% of our workforce. Our focus is to recruit, hire, 
develop, promote and retain top diverse talent. We continue to work toward a diverse workforce at all employee levels, from entry level to executive.

OUR CULTURE
Talent Acquisition and Development
Internship and Student Programs
To fill our pipeline with top incoming talent, we offer paid internship programs for sales, technology and corporate positions at our corporate 
campus and field locations across the country. Additionally, we hosted two summer engagement programs in sales and technology. The free, 
two-week events, led by Paycom recruiting, sales and technology team members, provided professional development and technical training to college 
students interested in future opportunities at Paycom.
Diversity Partners
Paycom currently partners with 16 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and 11 Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs). We continue to 
strengthen those partnerships and identify additional opportunities to provide resources to and bolster the employment pipeline for HBCU and HSI 
graduates. One successful partnership is the Langston Career Closet at Langston University in Oklahoma, which provides job seekers and college 
recruits business attire for career fairs and interviews. Additionally, we work with other programs, such as WayUp and SV Academy, to connect 
with and attract diverse talent entering the workforce.
In 2021, Paycom sponsored both the Grace Hopper Celebration and Society of Women Engineers Conference, two events aimed at eliminating 
gender disparity in STEM. We hope to continue contributing to breaking down barriers for women in our industry. 
Employee Development
Ensuring our employees have the training and resources they need to do their jobs starts with our new employees. New employees receive 
robust training on our digital tools, business strategy and more. Our commitment to employee development extends through continued education 
offerings and leadership development programs at every level, which helps us perform at our best every day.Rising Leaders. Paycom’s leadership development program, Elevate, kicked off in 2020. The goal of the program is to provide enhanced 
opportunities for professional growth to first-time leaders, giving them the tools and resources needed to be effective and successful. Leaders 
complete 30 hours of blended learning during a 12-week period, including self-study and facilitator-led sessions with their cohort.
Experienced Leaders. Experienced leaders are also able to build their business acumen and leadership skills. Our leadership academy includes 
training focused on personal and professional development. It’s designed to introduce new ways of thinking in order to provide high-level insight 
and understanding of leadership principles across Paycom.
Furthermore, we partner with external leadership coaching programs for employees at the director level and above. Participants are matched 
with leadership mentors that provide one-on-one coaching sessions, assist the leadership team with collaborative and strategic conversations, 
advise on building relationships across business lines and promote an overall growth mindset.
Future Leaders. We also offer Basecamp, a program focused on building foundations for future leaders. Basecamp equips high-potential 
individual contributors with leadership foundations, resources and tools that strengthen them in their current roles and equip them to transition 
into a future leadership role. Participants complete 11 hours of blended learning during an eight-week period, including self-study and facilitator-
led debriefs with their cohort. 
In addition, Paycom conducted development and compensation reviews for its employees in 2021. The review process contains an employee self-
evaluation portion allowing for open dialogue between employees and their leaders. Our employees and leaders utilize Paycom’s own software 
tools to facilitate development reviews.

Support for Employees
Our philosophy is to support our employees inside and outside their 
careers. We are committed to providing our employees with a safe, 
engaging environment where they feel empowered to work hard 
toward common goals. Paycom’s employees thrive on collaboration, 
yet flourish in an environment that celebrates their individuality. We 
celebrate this with a variety of annual events, including National 
Payroll Week and Customer Service Week festivities. Paycom 
also actively recognizes, celebrates and educates during cultural 
observances such as Black History Month, Women’s History Month, 
Diversity Month, Pride Month, Mental Health Awareness Month and 
Juneteenth. During these observances, we highlight employees’ 
experiences, share educational resources, offer ways for employees 
to give to inclusive organizations and provide opportunities for 
meaningful conversations with others.
We recognize that physical, mental and emotional well-being are at 
the foundation of our employees’ success. To foster this, we provide 
a myriad of health and benefits programs to all employees, including 
a $1 employee health insurance plan with mental health coverage. 
Additionally, employees at our corporate facilities have access to a 
number of Paycom’s health and wellness opportunities, such as fully 
equipped fitness centers. Centers were closed in 2021 due to COVID-19, 
but we continued to provide fitness classes virtually. Our Oklahoma 
City corporate campus also contains four acres of greenspace and two 
cafés that offer subsidized catered lunches with a daily healthy option.We also offer financial benefits, such as financial wellness tools and 
identity theft protection, to all employees. Furthermore, all employees are 
eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and full-time 
employees are able to enroll in a 401(k) plan with a company match 
program after 90 days of service.
In addition to our employee assistance program, Paycom introduced 
well-being advisors in 2020. These advisors offer a customized and 
effective approach to learning skills and finding solutions for mental 
health and well-being obstacles. The program provides employees 
with a confidential mental health and wellness resource — individually 
and in group settings — to foster a more inclusive, productive 
workplace. When necessary, our advisors can also connect employees 
with external mental health and well-being resources.
Support for Families
It is our belief that when we champion families, we empower our 
employees and allow them to achieve at their fullest potential. To 
support new parents and assist in balancing work and family matters, 
Paycom provides paid parental leave to eligible employees for 
bonding or caring for a newborn or adopted child. 
We have also implemented comprehensive support for parents in 
our workforce. Paycom benefits include support through fertility, 
pregnancy, pregnancy loss, postpartum, adoption, surrogacy and new parenthood, as well as resources for returning to work after leave. In 
addition, employees have access to a discounted child care platform 
offering full-time and part-time recurring care, occasional care and 
backup care from caregivers of their choice.
Paycom supports all members of the family, and benefits that extend 
to legal spouses are inclusive of any gender or sexual orientation. 
We also offer a support program for those acting as caregivers for both 
children and adults at no cost to our employees, as well as insurance 
coverage for pets.
COVID-19
Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained a 
transparent, intentional and conservative approach to managing the workplace. 
In March 2020, we transitioned our workforce to a remote work 
environment and adjusted leave policies to protect the health and 
safety of our employees. We provided 80 hours of COVID-19 leave 
time to cover personal or household illness, and we eliminated 
new-hire leave restrictions for COVID-19 and sick time. To protect our 
employees and the communities around us, we also switched all in-
person events to virtual and suspended work-related travel. Every step of the way, resources and updates were consistently 
communicated to all employees. Additionally, we added our well-
being advisor program and provided coaching for leaders on handling 
COVID-19 questions and concerns from employees. We offered a 
Better Conversations special session for employees to have their 
voices heard during the challenging global pandemic. 
In late 2021, we were able to implement a safe and gradual return-
to-office plan. We continued to provide additional leave time and 
instituted rigorous protections on campus such as enhanced 
sanitization and social distancing measures. In addition, we offered 
optional flu shots and COVID-19 vaccinations at our free, on-site 
clinic as well as a voucher program for flu shots at sales offices and for 
employees not covered under health insurance plans.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT26 27
OUR COMMUNITY
Community Giving
We are deeply committed to giving back to our community and receive a vast number of requests each year from organizations across the 
country. To maximize our impact and ensure our charitable footprint reaches as many people in need as possible, giving is supported at both the 
corporate level through quarterly grant programs and individually during monthly employee giving opportunities.
Paycom gives to the communities in which we live across the country, supporting sustainable programs that ensure basic needs are met and 
encourage a brighter future for all. These programs support children and families, veterans, people living with disabilities, STEM curriculum, 
environmental education and mental health. We focus efforts based in communities in which we live and operate.
Standout 2021 contributions and involvement:
Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma and Feeding America
Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma leads the fight against hunger in the state and envisions a community where no one goes hungry. The food bank 
distributes food through a network of more than 1,300 community-based partner agencies and schools in 53 counties in central and western 
Oklahoma and is a leader in educating the public on hunger, advocating for those living with hunger and providing access to additional resources.
In 2021, Paycom and our 
employees donated nearly 
$2 million to over 250 
organizations based in 32 
states and Washington, D.C.Feeding America is the largest hunger-relief organization in the United States. Its mission is to advance change in America by ensuring equitable 
access to nutritious food for all in partnership with food banks, policymakers and supporters in the communities they serve. With Paycom’s 
donation, Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma and Feeding America were able to provide 210,000 meals across the country.
Imua Family Services
Paycom supported Imua Family Services, whose mission is to empower children and families to reach their full potential. Programs and staff 
assist children and families to overcome developmental learning challenges in the most formative years of childhood. This donation helped Imua 
continue and improve its programming at its service centers in Maui, Lana’i and Molokai, Hawaii. 
Honoring America’s Warriors
Paycom has a proud history of supporting veterans services and organizations. In 2021, we donated to Honoring America’s Warriors, an 
organization dedicated to providing service dogs and training for disabled veterans. Our donation helped Honoring America’s Warriors strengthen 
its programming and events allowing these men and women to connect with other veterans in a peer-to-peer environment.

mental health challenges. This donation helped expand efforts for the NAMI Helpline, which is a free, nationwide peer-support service providing 
information, resource referrals and assistance to people living with a mental health condition.
Calm Waters is dedicated to helping bereaved children in their grief journey after a death, divorce or significant loss. The Oklahoma-based 
organization used our donation to help fund support groups, counseling and consultations, parenting seminars, workplace crisis services and trainings.

families by providing immediate, stable and loving homes for Oklahoma’s foster children. In 2021, Paycom and our employees contributed to the 
Gumdrops and Lollipops event and participated in a toy drive donating over 600 toys for holiday gifts for the children. Paycom employees have

In 2021, Paycom donated the largest amount the Oklahoma City-based nonprofit has received as part of its annual Red Kettle Campaign to help 
the local chapter of The Salvation Army assist Oklahomans in need during the holiday season and beyond. This annual year-end contribution 
assists individuals and families needing support, whether it be food assistance, a hot meal, temporary housing in shelter facilities, rent or utility 
assistance or winterwear. Finally, our Holidazzle event provided nearly 500 coats to The Salvation Army to give to those in need during the winter season.

the help of its donors, PADI AWARE has protected over two dozen shark and ray species, driven over 222,000 conservation actions, removed 2 
million pieces of marine debris and advanced groundbreaking citizen science. Paycom has been a partner of the PADI AWARE Foundation since 2018. 
Boys & Girls Club of Oklahoma County

City Public Schools, allowing it to serve 2,500 more students. Thousands of kids in the Oklahoma City metro will now have access to academic 
enrichment, sports, activities and mentoring. Boys & Girls Club of Oklahoma County operates 12 clubs with a total of 5,000 youth members.

a joint partnership of five nonprofit organizations dedicated to facilitating a conversation on race in our home state. The goal of this program is 
to bring together local leaders to listen, learn and understand race and race relations in the context of business, government, schools and criminal justice. 
On the national scale, Paycom is a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and various chambers in communities in which we operate across the country.Maisha Project and Water4
Both based out of Oklahoma City, Maisha Project and Water4 provide essential services in communities across Africa. 
Maisha Project aims to break generational poverty by providing children in Kenya with crucial wellness resources and education. The mission 
of Maisha Project is to transform lives and empower communities through lasting solutions to address poverty, hunger and lack of education. 
Our donation in 2021 helped the organization invest in schools, health care, local entrepreneurship and community building projects to foster 
economic empowerment and sustainability.
Water4 is dedicated to eradicating the world’s water crisis through local, mission-based business in 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Water4 
reimagines the role charity plays in the solution to the water crisis by partnering with local entrepreneurs who use donated capital to operate 
locally owned water service businesses sustained by local people paying affordable rates for safe water. In 2021, Paycom’s donation provided 
capital for sustainable water resources.

servers and consuming less energy. In our largest data centers, we utilize closed system, cold-aisle containment to decrease energy consumption and 
increase efficiency. 
In late 2021, Paycom’s Texas Operations Center opened in Grapevine, Texas. This location, powered by 100% renewable 
grid electricity, houses similar facilities to our corporate headquarters, including processing and production facilities. 
Demonstrating our commitment to and alignment with high standards in data center infrastructure functionality and 
effectiveness, we received an Uptime Institute Tier IV Certification of Design Documents award for our data center at 
our Texas Operations Center.In 2021,  47 ,695 lbs.  of Paycom electronic assets were processed,
