Building the future
At its core, our business  
connects people with each 
other and the world around 
them. Our technology powers 
connections that enable people, 
businesses and society to do 
amazing, groundbreaking 
things. That is an awesome 
power, and not something we 
take lightly. It’s why we’re com -
mitted to using our technology 
and our assets to help build  
a brighter future.
For example, our smart  
community and intelligent traf -
fic solutions help people use 
resources more efficiently, 
making cities cleaner and more 
livable. And, we’re creating inno -
vative solutions to make the 
food supply chain safer, to make 
healthcare more accessible 
and to harness the power of  
5G to turn innovative ideas  
into reality. These growing 
areas of our business are  
delivering increasing value  
to our shareholders while mak -
ing a significant contribution  
to society. 
Every day, we provide  
meaningful work and benefits, 
including a diverse and inclu -
sive work environment, to more 
than 155,000 employees.  And every hour, we are diligent 
in safeguarding our customers’ 
privacy and data security. We 
manage our supply chain 
responsibly to ensure our busi -
ness is not adversely impacting 
the environment or societal  
values of communities around 
the globe, and we are working 
to reduce greenhouse gas emis -
sions. In fact, our 2022 goal is for 
our networks and solutions to 
save more than twice the amount 
of emissions that our operations 
create and by 2025, our goal is 
to reduce the carbon intensity 
of our operations (a measure  
of the overall carbon we emit 
divided by the data carried by 
our networks) by 50 percent 
from the 2016 baseline.
Through our community  
investment, we are addressing 
a very important societal  
challenge outlined in the United 
Nations Sustainable Develop -
ment Goal #4. Our society is on 
the cusp of the Fourth Industrial 
Revolution. As many as 77 per -
cent of U.S. jobs in the year 2020 
will require technology skills, 
according to experts. But millions 
of students lack access to tech -
nology and tech education in 
today’s schools, setting them 
up to be left behind in the digital economy. We are helping to 
provide underserved middle 
school students with the skills 
needed to put them on the path 
to success in an increasingly 
technology-dependent econ -
omy, with a goal to reach 6 million 
students by 2023.
Lately, the notion of corporate 
purpose has been a hot topic  
of discussion. But at Verizon, 
we have never wavered – we 
are committed to sharing our 
success with the world around 
us to make it better. I invite you 
to learn about the many actions 
we took in 2017 in pursuit of our 
mission to deliver the promise 
of the digital age.

Building the future
Verizon's CSR priorities 
Guided by our Credo and rigorous  
stakeholder engagement
T o establish our corporate responsibility priorities we started with  
our Credo, the set of principles that defines who we are and what our 
customers value. One of these principles is: We focus outward on the 
customer, not inward. With this in mind, in 2017 we partnered with Business 
for Social Responsibility (BSR), the global sustainability nonprofit, to 
engage our stakeholders in the process of identifying and prioritizing 
those environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues most relevant 
to our business. We interviewed customers, investors, employees, 
nonprofits and policymakers. We also considered how ESG issues 
impacted Verizon’s operations, technology and innovation. The findings, 
depicted in the graphic to the right, inform our strategy and reporting.

Defining our purpose
Guided by our Credo and  
the stakeholder feedback  
we received, we identified 
two of the United Nations 
Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) where our tech -
nology and resources can 
make a unique contribution. 
The first is SDG 4, helping to 
provide under-resourced 
youth relevant skills for good 
jobs and entrepreneurship. 
The second is SDG 8, decou -
pling economic growth from 
emissions and promoting 
resource efficiency.
As part of our strategy, we 
set goals that demonstrate 
how we are contributing to 
the achievement of each of 
these SDGs:
Education goal: By 2023, Verizon 
will help provide 6 million stu -
dents with the skills required  
to put them on the path to  
success in an increasingly 
tech-dependent job market. Sustainability goals: 
• By 2020, 75 percent of 
suppliers assessed will be 
compliant with Verizon's 
overall CSR standards. 
• By 2022, Verizon’s net -
works and connected 
solutions will save more 
than double the amount of 
global emissions that our 
operations create. 
• By 2025, we will reduce our 
carbon intensity (a measure 
of the overall carbon we emit 
divided by the terabytes of 
data carried by our networks) 
by 50 percent over the  
2016 baseline.
• By 2030, we will plant 2 million 
trees in communities around 
the world, including 250,000 
in areas impacted by the 2017 
hurricane season.

Helping humans do more
At Verizon, we have one mission: to give humans the ability to do more in this world. We call it Humanability, and it’s why we’re partnering with  
visionaries from just about every industry you can imagine, to enable humans to do more than they ever thought possible. Using technology

By 2023, our goal is to help  
provide 6 million middle school 
students with the skills to put 
them on the path to success in 
an increasingly tech-dependent 
job market. We have set this  
target because today, millions 
of underserved students lack 
access to technology in the 
classroom and at home. Without 
help, they will be left behind in 
the digital economy. In 2017 , 
we launched a documentary 
and a national movement that 
spotlights the crisis.
T o reach our goal, our Verizon 
Innovative Learning initiative 
delivers free technology, free access and innovative learning 
programs to under-resourced 
schools and students across 
America. We build programs 
from the ground up, using  
Verizon’s technology to provide 
tech-infused curricula that are 
hands-on and immersive. These 
programs transform middle 
schools with digital technology, 
immerse minority boys and rural 
girls in tech and entrepreneurship 
education, and train high school 
students to put design thinking 
principles to use in solving real-
world business and societal 
challenges. And we are diligent 
in measuring the impact of  
our programs.In 2017 , almost 128,000 students 
participated in our Verizon  
Innovative Learning initiative. 
Our employees – the V T eam – 
play an important role in our 
work. In 2017 , nearly 1,400  
V T eamers served as STEM  
mentors. Learn more about

Disaster response 
Helping to rebuild communities
In 2017, Verizon and its employees rushed to the aid of customers who were victims of hurricanes, wildfires and floods. Our employees 
proved to be as powerful and resilient as our network, and their efforts helped millions of people impacted by these disasters 
get back on their feet. In total, Verizon donated $75 million to disaster recovery and community projects throughout the U.S., 
including Puerto Rico, with $16.1 million supporting recovery efforts from Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma, the California 
wildfires and other disasters. 
More than  
2,000 employees   
from Verizon’s call centers served as volunteers, 
taking donations for the Hand in Hand telethon to 
benefit survivors of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Verizon committed  
$10 million  to support 
Hurricane Harvey relief efforts and more 
than $6 million  for Hurricanes 
Maria and Irma, the California wildfires and 
other disasters.Building

Energy-efficient solutions
More solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
One of the most important ways that we help humans do more is to enable them to be more 
resource-efficient. Our connected solutions help our customers save energy and reduce their  
carbon emissions. We work with the Carbon T rust, a respected nonprofit, to measure the yearly 
reduction in CO 2 equivalent (CO 2e) emissions our customers are achieving through the use of  
our products and services. In 2017 , our solutions enabled the avoidance of a minimum of 7 .7 million 
metric tons of CO 2e. The emissions avoided represent approximately 138 percent of emissions 
associated with our operations (Scope 1 and 2).

Energy & emissions
Reducing our environmental impact
Throughout Verizon’s operations we have adopted strategies to minimize our environmental impact and drive greater efficiency.  
More than 93 percent of Verizon’s emissions come from the electricity we use to power our networks.
In 2017 , we implemented several initiatives to increase energy efficiency in our larger wireless core data centers and made progress  
in lowering energy usage at these facilities. We also continued to invest in improving the overall energy efficiency of our facilities with 
numerous initiatives that included mechanical and whole-building control systems, LED lighting, HVACs and chillers, high-efficiency 
motors, economizers, cable dehydrators and high-efficiency uninterruptible power supplies.

Carbon intensityHaving exceeded our 2020 goal 
four years early, in 2016 we set a 
new carbon intensity reduction 
target (the carbon our business 
emits divided by the terabytes 
of data we transport over our 
networks). The new 2025 goal 
is a 50 percent reduction from 
our 2016 baseline. 
Our success to date in reducing 
carbon intensity has been made 
possible by copper-to-fiber 
migrations, investments in 
green energy, building improve -
ments and changes in our fleet 
operations. We are pursuing 
opportunities for continued, 
sustained progress and will 
continue to measure and dis -
close our performance against 
the 2025 carbon intensity goal.
Our results are independently 
assured. We commissioned 
independent external assur -

Efficient mobility
Reducing unnecessary trips to 
customer locations saves time, 
costs and fuel. That's why we've 
implemented sophisticated 
customer self-installation, self-  
diagnostic and online trouble -
shooting tools, which help to 
reduce the number of service 
visits required by our technicians. 
These tools contribute to greater 
efficiency for usage of our fleet 
and its fuel consumption. Also, 
in 2017 , we added 234 hybrid 
vans to our fleet in New York to

Over the past six years, Verizon 
has made it a priority to deploy 
more green energy resources 
– such as solar and fuel cell 
technology –  into our facilities. 
We’ve set a goal to add an addi -
tional 24MW of green energy in 
our operations by 2025.
 In 2017 , we made initial progress 
toward our 2025 goal by install -
ing 30KW of solar energy at 
one of our European facilities  
in Luxembourg.
 
In 2018, we will continue to work 
toward our 2025 goal.
Environmentally efficient stores & facilities
We’re focused on applying best 
practices to improve the efficiency 
of our facilities, including data 
centers, which are especially 
energy-intensive. By implement -
ing better cooling technologies 
at our Colorado Springs data 
center, we achieved a significant 
improvement in Power Utilization 
Effectiveness (PUE), reducing 
PUE to 1.28 in 2017 . Across our 
facilities, we make extensive use of economizers, which bring 
outside air into the HVAC system 
when it is cooler outside than 
in, thereby decreasing energy 
use. In 2017 , we installed 5,654 
new economizers, bringing our 
total deployed to approximately 
33,000 units. These systems 
have produced estimated reduc -
tions in electrical consumption of 
214 million kilowatt hours and 
CO 2e of 148,000 metric tons.Committed to pursuing

Managing waste
Verizon is dedicated to a standard of environmental stewardship that meets or exceeds legal requirements. 
Paper waste
We are committed to the  
sustainable sourcing and  
use of paper, as detailed  
in our Paper Sourcing and  
Use policy .Over the past three years,  
Verizon Wireless has reduced 
the amount of printed materials  
for customer orders by 49 per -
cent. For 2017 , this represents 
avoiding using approximately 
354 tons of paper or about 
7 ,000 trees.
*This excludes billing segments that are not able to print on recycled-content 
paper due to machinery issues.Goal: 
At least  
50%  
of our paper annually 
includes 10 percent  
post-consumer waste 
(PCW) content.* 2017 Progress: 
70%  
In 2017, we exceeded  
this goal with 70 percent 
(19 percent more than 
2016) of our sourced paper 
including at least 10 percent 
PCW content.
Recycling
There’s a big opportunity to 
reduce the number of cell phones, 
set-top boxes and other elec -

landfills by reusing or recycling 
them. We refurbish and redistrib -

Batteries and telecom materials  
Our practices for recycling batteries exceed regulatory mandates. Verizon sends materials from 
U.S. operations for recycling to approved facilities in the U.S. or Canada. These facilities are audited 
at least every five years. In addition, we require suppliers to send their used batteries to approved 
recycling facilities that meet Verizon’s Environmental, Health and Safety Standards.

Building togetherThe center of what we do is to 
connect people and cultures 
across the world. We under -
stand that we cannot fulfill  
that role without a strong and 
enduring commitment to the  
diversity and inclusion that 
reflects our world. One of our 
foremost objectives as an 
organization is to create a  
collaborative, inclusive and 
diverse environment – within 
Verizon, with our customers, 
and among our business part -
ners and suppliers. We believe 
this commitment is essential to 
the success of our business. 
Our Equal Employment  
Opportunity Policy  implements 
our commitment to diversity 
and inclusion.
 Verizon’s commitment to  
diversity and inclusion encom -
passes the principle that all 
employees should be compen -
sated equitably for similar work 
and should have an equal 
opportunity to contribute and 
advance in the workplace.  
In January of 2017 , Verizon  
published its Pay Equity  
Commitment  where it commit -
ted to identify and promote best 
practices in compensation,  
hiring, promotion and career 
development; to develop strate -
gies to reduce unconscious bias; 
and to make hiring, promotion and 
compensation decisions that 
promote pay equity. In October 
2017 , Verizon removed from its 
employment applications around 
the globe all questions seeking 
current or past salary information 
of applicants for employment.We continue to invest in the 
growth of women and people  
of color  on the V T eam. Among 
our most successful initiatives: 
• A 12-month mentorship  
program that matches 
senior executives and 
women V T eam members 
with the goal of advancing 
leadership skills and 
development.
• Competitive Advantage, a 
six-month program support -
ing managers who are people 
of color, fosters leadership 
development and networking 
with senior leaders.
• We launched in 2016, and are 
expanding in 2018, required 
workshops for our leadership 
team to explore unconscious 
bias and how to mitigate its 
impact to create a more 
inclusive workplace.We promote diversity and 
encourage the contribution 
of diverse business partners  
to our success in our Short-
T erm Incentive Plan, which 
includes a 5 percent diversity 
and sustainability metric relating 
to the percentage of minority 
and female employees based  
in the U.S., our overall supplier 
spending directed to minority- 
and female-owned firms, and 
reductions in carbon intensity. 
Verizon is a sponsor of Women 
in T echnology and Entrepre -
neurship in NY (WiTNY) . We 
partner on a number of initia -
tives, including the "winternship" 
program – two-week internships 
for college freshmen and sopho -
mores during their winter break. 
In January 2017 , Verizon was the 
first company to partner with 
WiTNY to pilot the initiative. We 
had five winterns who all came 
back for internships with Verizon 
in the summer of 2017 . As a result 
of the pilot, in 2018 WiTNY plans 
to expand the program to include 
more than 40 companies and 
170 students.

Supplier Code of ConductOur global supply chain
Our suppliers align with our 
Supplier Code of Conduct, 
which means acting with integrity, 
obeying all applicable health, 
safety and environmental laws, 
and protecting confidential and 
proprietary information. 
Our Supplier Code of  
Conduct also: 
• forbids the use of child  
labor, forced labor and 
discrimination; 
• protects employees’ rights 
to freedom of association 
and collective bargaining, as 
permitted by local laws; and 
• describes how suppliers 
should work with us on  
compliance and enforce -
ment issues. Verizon reserves the right to 
review or audit our suppliers’ 
compliance with the Supplier 
Code. We also incorporate 
ongoing compliance into our 
business relationships and  
procurement decisions. 
V T eamers are trained about 
social and environmental  
supply chain issues, including 
supplier assessment, through 
initiatives such as green bag 
sessions, monthly Green Insider 
newsletters, and on-site recruit -
ing and engagement events.
Our complete Supplier Code  
is available here: http://www.
verizon.com/about/sites/
default/files/Verizon-Supplier-
Code-of-Conduct.pdf .Our global supply chain includes over $50 billion in goods and services procured around the world. These goods include handsets, 
accessories and network equipment to support our global infrastructure. The vice president who leads supply chain operations 
also serves as Verizon Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairman of the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI).

Conflict minerals
We encourage our partners  
to take steps to ensure that 
their products do not include 
materials that either directly  
or indirectly finance or benefit 
armed groups in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (or in  
any adjoining country). Our Conflict Minerals Statement 
contains more information on 
our approach to this issue and 
is available here:

Supplier performance
Assessing our partners’ compliance
We use a third-party platform 
from EcoVadis to assess our 
suppliers' corporate responsibil -
ity performance. Since 2013, we 
have invited 405 key suppliers to 
the platform. EcoVadis’ assess -
ment approach focuses on four 
key areas: environment, fair labor 
practices, ethics/fair business 
practices, and supply chain.
 
EcoVadis combines supplier 
questionnaire input with its own 
research based on public sources 
to benchmark suppliers on their 
corporate responsibility perfor -
mance. When weaknesses are 
identified, Verizon works with the 
supplier to create a corrective 
action plan and improve their current program. Both Verizon 
and the supplier benefit from 
this program.
 
Verizon has committed that 75 
percent of suppliers assessed 
will be compliant with the overall 
EcoVadis assessment, consisting 
of the four combined categories, 
by 2020.
Verizon is a member of the Joint 
Audit Cooperation (JAC), an 
association of telecom opera -
tors that collaboratively audits 
suppliers common to JAC 
members and looks for opportu -
nities to improve CSR across the 
Information and Communications 
T echnology industry. JAC bolsters Verizon’s CSR program 
by going beyond what suppliers 
pledge in their policies, to inves -
tigate their actual performance 
on-site. JAC has completed 366 
on-site supplier audits since its 
inception in 2010, and 89 of them 
were completed in 2017 .
 
Verizon joined the group in 2013 
as the first U.S.-based member 
and serves on both the Leader -
ship Assembly and Operational 
Board. Other members include 
A T&T, Deutsche T elekom, Orange, 
T elecom Italia, Proximus, KPN, 
Rogers, Swisscom, T elefónica, 
T elenor, T eliaSonera, and 
Vodafone.Verizon wants to do business 
with companies that prioritize 
health, safety and environmental 
stewardship. T o that end, we 
partner with the third-party 
assessment firm, Avetta, to 
screen our relevant contractors’ 
safety and environmental perfor -
mance. Avetta reviews injury 
rates, environmental health and 
safety violations, fines, corrective 
actions and other metrics, and 
compares the data to industry 
benchmarks. When weaknesses 
are identified, Verizon works 
with contractors to review root 
causes and corrective action 
plans. More than 2,000 contrac -
tors have registered in Avetta.

Building partnerships
We believe doing business  
with diverse suppliers creates  
a multiplier effect. Diverse  
suppliers deliver value to us  
by providing innovative goods, 
services and solutions that  
help make a difference to our 
customers, and they deliver 
value to the economy by  
contributing to our diverse 
communities.
In 2017 , we purchased more 
than $5 billion in goods and  
services from diverse suppliers, 
including businesses owned 
by minorities, women, veterans, 
LGBTQ and people with disabil -
ities. This brings our total spend 
with diverse suppliers to nearly 
$26 billion in the past five years.
Verizon is a charter member  
of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, 
a coalition of 27 companies  
that each spends more than  
$1 billion every year with  
diverse suppliers.

Building accountability
As our Credo states: We believe 
integrity is at the core of who 
we are. This belief governs 
every aspect of how we run our 
business, from how our Board 
of Directors operates to our 
engagement with stakeholders.
Integrity
We monitor conflicts of interest 
and require Verizon Code of 
Conduct training to safeguard 
the integrity of our business. 
We maintain a comprehensive 
ethics and compliance program 
that’s built on our Verizon Code of 
Conduct and includes ongoing 
educational communications, 
mandatory training and readily 
accessible tools. The Verizon 
Code of Conduct defines how 
we work. It establishes a set of 
guidelines aligned with the 
principles in our Verizon Credo 
and our Core Values of Integrity, 
Respect, Performance Excel -
lence and Accountability. The 
Code helps V T eamers make 
sound job-related decisions that 
strengthen our culture of integrity.
 
Compliance with the Code and 
applicable laws and regulations 
is expected wherever V T eam -
ers conduct business on behalf 
of Verizon. All employees must 
complete required Code train -
ing and apply its principles in their work. The Code outlines 
ethical and legal expectations 
in a number of areas, including:
• Maintaining an inclusive, fair 
and healthy work environment
• Maintaining integrity and 
fairness in the workplace
• Protecting Verizon’s assets 
and reputation
• Maintaining integrity and  
fairness in the marketplace
We also continue to share  
additional compliance and  
ethics-related communications 
with V T eamers, including train -
ing on privacy and information 
security for all employees. 
Verizon’s leadership team and 
Supply Chain Services organi -
zation are required to regularly

less network organizations, 
received a Conflict-of-Interest 
Questionnaire in 2017 .

Anti-corruption
V T eamers in relevant  
operational roles receive 
anti-corruption training and 
communications that clearly 
articulate our expectations, 
core principles and zero toler -
ance for corrupt activities or 
unethical business practices. Our training, which incorporates 
practical examples, helps 
employees understand and 
comply with various anti-bribery 
laws, including the U.K. Bribery 
Act and the U.S. Foreign  
Corrupt Practices Act. We 
instruct employees to seek legal approval before giving 
anything of value to a public  
official. We supplement our 
general compliance training 
with targeted communications 
and in-person instruction on  
an as-needed basis.Verizon enforces a 
zero-tolerance policy 
for unethical business 
practices, including 
bribery or corruption  
of any kind. 
Stakeholder engagement
Accessing diverse perspectives
Our long-standing Consumer 
Advisory Board (CAB), com -
posed of diverse leading  
business and public-interest 
advocates, provides us with  
an unfiltered view of relevant 
technology, consumer, busi -
ness and social issues at  
twice-yearly meetings. CAB 
members’ perspectives and 
advice play a role in the devel -
opment of many important  
Verizon policy and business 
decisions.We strive to make it easy for our 
stakeholders to understand 
our positions and progress on 
issues that matter to them. As 
such, we publish: 
• A semiannual T ransparency

customer information that 
we received in the U.S. and 
other countries in which  
we do business as of the

Building accountability
Verizon is governed by a 
12-member Board of Directors, 
and each member stands for 
election annually. Verizon’s 
business affairs are conducted 
by management, under the 
direction and supervision of the 
Board of Directors. The Board, 
and each committee of the 
Board, has complete access  
to management. At least once  
a year, the Board conducts  
a strategic planning session 
with management, and reviews 
succession planning and  
management development. 
Our Board is committed to the 
highest standards of corporate 
governance because it believes 
that an effective board will posi -
tively influence shareholder 
value, enhance Verizon’s  
reputation and create value  
for all our stakeholders. There 
are four standing committees: 
Audit, Corporate Governance 
and Policy, Finance, and  
Human Resources. All Board members, with the exception 
of our Chairman and CEO, are 
independent directors, and 
Ms. M. Frances Keeth serves as 
our lead Independent Director.
