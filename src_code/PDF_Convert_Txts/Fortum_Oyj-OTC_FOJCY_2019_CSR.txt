The entire energy sector is undergoing a transformation. 
The faster pace of climate change is accelerating the need 
for structural changes in society. The need for low-carbon 
electricity is growing because fossil fuels must be replaced in 
transportation, industry and heating.
In addition to climate change, changes in the regulatory 
environment and the fast pace of technological development 
create new challenges and opportunities for us. Our role is to 
respond to the changing operating environment by reshaping 
the energy system, improving resource efficiency and providing 
smart solutions. This way we deliver excellent shareholder value, 
minimise our adverse impacts, and ensure sustainable and low-
carbon business.
Sustainability is at the core of Fortum’s strategy and our 
values – curiosity, responsibility, integrity and respect – form 
the foundation for all our activities. In our operations, we give 
balanced consideration to climate and resource issues, as well 
as our impacts on personnel and society. We see sustainable 
energy and circular economy solutions as today’s competitive 
advantage and a prerequisite for business growth and success.

Fortum’s operations as a provider of energy and circular economy solutions support 
the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) on the journey towards a low-carbon 
society. In line with our vision, we are driving the change for a cleaner world.
Sustainable Development Goals and Fortum
The4Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  adopted by the United Nations in 2015 are global goals set to 
solve economic, social and environmental challenges by 2030. The 17 goals have been set based on science 
and research, and they aim to solve global-level social problems. Through the goals, the UN is calling for and 
inviting companies to take action to solve the challenges using business means and the creativity and innovation 
characteristic to companies � 
We at Fortum want to do our part to promote the achievement of these goals in our own value chain � We see 
business opportunities in the goals, but we also aim to shoulder our responsibility for our adverse impacts and 
to prevent them � Nine of the Sustainable Development Goals that are key for us are presented in the graphic � 
Through innovative products and services, we offer solutions for six of the goals on the right (Our opportunities). 
We are pursuing a low-carbon society not only within the framework of our own operations, but also through 
offering solutions to 4other sectors �
Goals 5 and 8 on the left (Our responsibilities) are important to us from the social-society perspective, for 
personnel, contractors and our entire supply chain. As for goal 15, we know the responsibility we have for our 
impacts and dependency related to aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity �We support the UN Sustainable Development Goals

Sustainability priorities have been defined to support 
sustainable business. In our operations, we take into 
consideration climate and resource issues as well as our 
impacts on personnel and society. The priorities reflect 
not only the views of our personnel and stakeholders 
regarding our most important impacts, but also our 
values – curiosity, responsibility, integrity, and respect 
towards each other and our stakeholders.
In 2019, we conducted a broad analysis of material sustainability themes 
for Fortum and its stakeholders � The material themes are associated with 
risks and opportunities for Fortum, and on the other hand, our operations
have an impact on them �
In the materiality analysis, we used artificial intelligence and big data-
driven application, which uses a large volume of data available from 
public sources to analyse the sustainability themes we have defined.   
We included in the review the following data sources: 
• energy sector’s annual and sustainability reporting 
• circular economy sector’s annual and sustainability reporting 
• mandatory regulation 
• voluntary initiatives and recommendations 
• news 
• social media 
We supplemented the data-based analysis with Nordic media tracking 
and with stakeholder surveys sent to more than 900 representatives 
of NGOs, customers, public administration, capital markets, research 
institutes, industry organisations and opinion leaders.
We clarified Fortum’s internal view about the most important 
sustainability themes through a survey sent to more than 6,700 Fortum 
employees, and in a workshop for top  management and experts.

 Sustainability priorities 
In December 2019, Fortum’s Board of Directors approved a new target 
for specific CO 2 emissions from total energy production, applicable for 
2020: ≤180 gCO 2/kWh. This target will be revised after consolidation of 
Uniper. Additionally, the Board approved total CO 2 emissions from energy 
production as part of the earnings criteria for the 2020–2022 long-term 
incentive (LTI) plan for key employees and executives.As a final result, we got both the stakeholders’ external and the 
company’s internal view of sustainability themes most material for 
Fortum; the most important of which are presented in the graphic (on 
page 7) as priorities. We also decided to highlight four general themes 
that form the foundation for Fortum’s corporate responsibility: corporate 
governance, economic value creation, stakeholder engagement, and 
diversity and equal opportunity �
We believe that the results of the materiality analysis will help us 
to prioritise the most important sustainability themes in our business 
operations, steer our sustainability work, and better respond to 
stakeholder expectations.
Sustainability targets affect every Fortum employee 
Sustainability targets affect every Fortum employee and safety-related 
targets are part of Fortum’s short-term incentive (STI) programme. In 
addition to the Group-level targets, divisions have their own targets. 
Fortum’s Board of Directors annually decides on the sustainability 
targets to be included in the incentive programme � The combined 
injury frequency for Fortum employees and contractors was included 
in the incentive programme in 2019. However, the Board can, at its 
discretion, take into consideration in the result also other safety-related 
incidents and especially the number of severe occupational accidents � 
The target for severe occupational accidents is zero. In 2019, one severe 
occupational accident took place in our operations �
The 2020 short-term incentive programme remains unchanged in 
terms of safety targets (the injury frequency rate for personnel and 
contractors). Likewise, as in 2019, the Board has the option to take into 
consideration also other safety incidents � The weight of the target in the 
incentive programme is 10% (2019: 10%).

Climate and resources Personnel and society Appendices 11
 Sustainability at Fortum
We support the SDGs Sustainability priorities Business ethics and compliance
 We create value
We believe there is a clear connection between high 
standards of ethical business practices and excellent 
financial results. As an industry leader, we obey the 
law, we embrace the spirit of integrity, and we uphold 
ethical business conduct wherever we operate.
Code of Conduct sets the basic requirements 
The Fortum Code of Conduct and Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct 
define how we treat others, engage in business, safeguard our corporate 
assets, and how we expect our suppliers and business partners to 
operate � 
Fortum’s Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s mission 
and values and has approved the Fortum Code of Conduct� The online 
training on the Code of Conduct is part of the induction programme 
for new employees � The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the ten 
principles of the UN Global Compact and has been approved by the Head 
of Procurement in collaboration with the purchasing steering group �
About 97% of Fortum’s total purchasing volume is purchased 
from suppliers with a purchasing volume of EUR 50,000 or more. 
Geographically they target mainly suppliers in Russia, Finland, Sweden 
and Norway � The Supplier Code of Conduct is part of purchase 
agreements with a contract value of at least EUR 50,000. 
In line with the Code of Conduct, Fortum has zero tolerance for 
corruption and fraud and does not award donations to political parties 
or political activities, religious organisations, authorities, municipalities or 
local administrations �Business ethics and compliance
Compliance risks
The compliance risks related to our business operations include the 
potential risk of bribery or corruption, fraud and embezzlement, non-
compliance with legislation or company rules, conflicts of interest, 
improper use of company assets, and working under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs � Compliance risk management is an integrated part 
of business operations. Key compliance risks, including action plans, 
are identified, assessed and reported annually. This applies also to the 
management of risks related to sustainability �
Training 
Fortum has a Compliance programme covering key areas of regulatory 
compliance and business ethics � It is managed with a risk-based 
prioritisation � 
Training is a fundamental part of Fortum’s Compliance programme � 
In 2019 personnel of Joint Venture projects in India and Indonesia 
were trained. Training on the Market Abuse Regulation including insider 
regulations was provided for new individuals who needed it based on 
their role � Training on competition law issues was provided also for new 
individuals responsible for sales � 
Reporting misconduct 
In addition to internal reporting channels, Fortum has an external 
4“SpeakUp”  channel  which was renewed in July 2019. The new external 
channel replaced the old internal channel � The same mechanism is used 
for reporting any suspected misconduct relating to the environment, 
labour practices or human rights violations, and it is available to all 
stakeholders. In Russia, Fortum has a separate compliance organisation 
in place and employees there are encouraged to use the channels provided by the compliance organisation. They may, however, also use 
the “SpeakUp” channel should they so wish. 
Suspected misconduct and measures related to ethical business 
practices and compliance with regulations are regularly reported to the 
Audit and Risk Committee by the Group Compliance Officer.
Suspected cases of misconduct
A total of 102 reports of suspected misconduct were made in 2019. By 
year-end, all cases had been reviewed. There was no cause for action to 
be taken in 36 of the cases investigated. As a result of the investigations, 
nine employment contracts were terminated and four written warnings 
were given �
More than 60% of the investigated cases were related to non-
compliance with company rules. In these cases, corrective action was 
taken by reviewing and developing existing processes and instructions 
and by providing training for employees � 
Fortum has zero tolerance towards alcohol and drug use, and 
thousands of random breathalyser tests are conducted annually. In 2019 
altogether 19 cases related alcohol or drug use during working hours 
were identified. 
No cases of corruption or bribery were confirmed in 2019. Fortum also 
requires its goods and service suppliers as well as its business partners 
to comply with a zero tolerance policy towards corruption and bribery � 
We deal with potential cases of corruption in a professional manner, 
in accordance with the defined compliance investigation process, in line 
with applicable laws and with respect to the rights and personal integrity 
of all parties involved �

Restricting competition
In 2019 there was one ongoing investigation case in Russia for which 
Fortum was given a warning but not ordered to pay a fine. Other cases 
related to restricting competition were not reported �  
Other significant fines
There were no significant fines issued during the year. 
In Russia Fortum paid fines totalling RUB 10,000 (EUR 137) for 
exceeding the wastewater emissions limits. Fortum also paid fines 
totalling SEK 50,000 (EUR 4,736) because the minimum flow obligation 
was not met at one hydropower plant in Sweden in 2016. The police 
investigation regarding a possible environmental violation at a waste 
incineration and treatment site initiated in 2018 in Sweden was still 
ongoing � 
Environmental enquiries and grievances
Power plants receive environmental enquiries and other contacts every 
year, and they are mainly handled locally. The aim is to communicate in 
advance about upcoming measures that have possible environmental 
impacts, for example, through local media and at public events. 
Fortum’s website also has a grievance channel that our stakeholders 
can use to report problems possibly caused by our operations � No new 
environment-related grievances were reported to us through this channel 
in 2019.

Some of the environmental impacts of energy production are global or 
wide-reaching, some are regional or local. We manage our environmental 
impacts with environmental management systems. 99.8% of our 
electricity and heat production globally is certified to the ISO 14001 
environmental management system standard � 
In terms of Fortum’s operations, the key environmental aspects include:
• Climate change 
• Renewable energy production 
• Circular economy 
• Emissions 
• Environmental impacts
• Fuel procurement
Climate change mitigation 
We can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by increasing carbon 
dioxide-free energy production and the use of renewable energy, and 
by improving the energy efficiency of our power and heat production. 
In line with the strategy, Fortum targets a multi-gigawatt wind and solar 
portfolio, which is subject to the capital recycling business model.Circular economy boosts resource efficiency 
We recycle significant amounts of waste and energy production 
by-products generated in our operations. Additionally, in circular economy 
services, we recycle, reuse and recover waste received from customers 
as materials or energy production � The continuous improvement of 
resource and energy efficiency is important in terms of the sufficiency of 
natural resources and climate change mitigation �
Advanced combustion technology 
Fuel use generates sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particle emissions 
that degrade air quality and cause acidification of soil and water 
systems � Flue-gas emissions can be effectively reduced with various 
flue-gas cleaning technologies and combustion technology solutions. 
All our power plants operate in line with environmental permits � We 
have supplied also other energy companies with combustion technology 
solutions designed to reduce nitrogen oxides.
Mitigation of hydropower’s environmental impacts
Damming rivers and regulating water systems change the natural water 
levels and cause changes in aquatic habitats � We actively take part in 
research activities in the sector and implement voluntary and permit-
based measures to develop biodiversity, fish populations and the multi-
use of water systems where we produce hydropower �

More renewable energy
In 2019, we made investment decisions and invested in new wind and 
solar power. At the end of 2019, we commissioned the first wind turbines 
of the total 97-MW Sørfjord wind park in Norway. Fortum also has the 
90-MW Kalax wind farm under construction in Finland. 
In December 2019, Fortum signed an agreement on the divestment 
of an 80% share of its Nordic wind power plants. Fortum retains a 20% 
minority ownership and continues its responsibility for the construction 
and operation of the plants. The arrangement is subject to Fortum’s 
capital recycling business model �
In late 2019, the Fortum and Rusnano investment fund with 50/50 
ownership decided to start a 200-MW wind power project in Kalmykia, 
Russia, and a 50-MW wind power project in the Rostov region. An 
additional 300 MW of wind power is under construction in the Rostov 
region, and electricity production is estimated to start in 2020. The 
projects are part of the investments approved for the 1,823 MW of 
construction rights � A separate investment decision will be made for each 
project. At the beginning of 2019, the new 50-MW Ulyanovsk-2 wind 
park, the first partnership project, was commissioned. 
In 2018 and 2019, Fortum also won the right to construct a total of 
116 MW of solar power in Russia. The production of the solar power 
plants is estimated to start in 2021–2022.
In 2018, Fortum sold its majority share in the Indian solar power 
plants in line with its capital recycling business model. In 2019, Fortum 
commissioned the 250-MW Pavagada 2 solar power plant in Karnataka, 
India. Additionally, the production of the new 250-MW solar power plant 
is estimated to start in Rajasthan State in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Refurbishments of Fortum’s own hydropower plants in Sweden and 
Finland produced 13.5 MW of new renewable electricity production 
capacity in 2019.New low-carbon production
Fortum is replacing some of the coal use in heat production by building 
the Kivenlahti bioheat plant in Espoo, Finland. Its maximum heat output 
will be 58 MW, and production is estimated to commence in summer 
2020. The Otaniemi geothermal plant is expected to be commissioned 
in late 2020, and the new heat pump unit utilising waste heat from 
wastewater is estimated to start its operations at the Suomenoja power 
plant in 2021. With these actions, Espoo’s district heating production is 
estimated to achieve 50% carbon neutrality in 2022.
Fortum and the City of Espoo have together committed to make 
Espoo’s district heating network carbon-neutral in the 2020s. Fortum has 
set an intermediate goal to discontinue the use of coal in Espoo in 2025. 
The accelerated project for carbon-neutrality in 2020’s is called

1Energy efficiency
Improving energy efficiency at power plants refers to measures we 
implement to increase the efficiency of production processes or reduce 
the energy consumption of plants or equipment� This enables us to 
produce more electricity or heat for our customers without increasing fuel 
consumption � 
The energy efficiency of power plants can be increased through 
investments and technical improvements, preventive maintenance, 
and by training personnel in the optimal operation of the plant and 
in monitoring the plant’s operating economy � Improving power plant 
availability also increases energy efficiency, as unplanned plant start-ups 
are reduced �
Energy-efficiency investments 
In fuel-based energy production, we aim to utilise the fuel’s energy as 
efficiently as possible. Our most important means to improve the energy 
efficiency of fuel use is to increase combined heat and power (CHP) 
production. In CHP production, up to 90% of the energy content of the 
fuels can be utilised. Separate electricity production’s efficiency is about 
40–60%. 
Significant projects improving energy efficiency were completed in 
2019, among others:
• Hydropower plant refurbishments in Sweden and Finland, 30 GWh
• Tartu district heating and cooling construction projects in Estonia,  
10 GWh 
The combined annual energy savings of the energy-efficiency 
improvement projects is about 70 GWh. Fortum’s Group-level target is 
to achieve an annual energy-efficiency improvement of ≥1,900 GWh by 2020 compared to 2012. By the end of 2019, the cumulative energy-
efficiency improvement achieved was 1,707 GWh/a.
Energy-efficiency services for homes and businesses
Fortum has introduced energy-efficiency services for private customers 
in Finland and Sweden. Fortum’s customers can, for instance, monitor 
their electricity consumption with an in-home display or control and 
optimise the heating of their homes based on electricity price and use �
Fortum’s operation and maintenance services also have been 
improving the energy efficiency of our customers’ power plants already 
for decades. In 2019, a project was launched to improve energy 
efficiency and plant capacity at the Riihimäki waste-to-energy plant in 
Finland; the results of the project will be ready in 2020.

The next highest fuel used was uranium and coal. Our goal in the future is 
to produce increasingly more added value from biofuel and waste-derived 
fuel�
In 2019 in Finland, we combuste bedding-manure mixture at the 
Järvenpää power plant and bio-oil at a heat plant in the Joensuu power 
plant area and at the Vermo heat plant in Espoo. In addition to Finland, 
biofuels were used in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Norway.

the usage volumes and fuel-specific caloric values measured at the power 
plants � Uranium consumption has been calculated from the thermal heat 
generation in the reactors � 
In 2019, Russia’s share of our total energy-specific fuel consumption 
was about 67%. Russia accounted for 99% of our use of natural gas. We 
used coal in Russia, Finland and Poland. Russia accounted for 57% of our 
use of coal, Finland for 23% and Poland for 20%. 
Energy intensity
In 2019, our fuel consumption in electricity and heat production was a 
total of 144 (2018: 119) TWh, or 412 (2018: 430) PJ. Additionally, we 
acquired 840 (2018: 990) GWh, or 3.0 (2019: 3.6) PJ, of electricity from 
external electricity suppliers. The electricity used in electric boilers in 
Norway has been added to electricity procurement figures.
With these energy resources, we produced 40,000 GWh of electricity, 
26,300 GWh of heat, 40 GWh of cooling, and 30 GWh of bio-oil. The 
total energy consumption, calculated as the difference between the 
procured energy resources and net production, was 48,900 (2018: 
51,400) GWh, or 176 (2018: 185) PJ. 
In combustion-based energy production, we aim to utilise the fuel 
as efficiently as possible. In 2019, our average fuel use efficiency was 
58% (2018: 58%). The increased condensing power production in Russia 
and the increased use of waste-derived fuels have contributed to the 
decrease in the fuel use efficiency. The efficiency has been calculated 
by dividing the electricity and heat energy produced with the fuel by the 
energy content of the fuel used in the production � 
The energy intensity of our own production was 1.7 (2018: 1.7). 
The intensity figure has been calculated by dividing the amount of 
used energy resources by the total net production of energy products, 
including also hydropower, wind power and solar power.

Security of supply
A functional society requires an uninterrupted and reliable supply of 
energy. With hydropower, we are balancing the growing, but weather-
dependent, fluctuating production of other renewable energy forms, 
like solar and wind, and we are enabling their growth. 4Hydropower’s 
flexibility  is needed to secure the functionality of the energy system and 
the power grid also during energy consumption peaks and to balance 
fluctuations in the price of electricity.
If a sufficient supply of hydropower is not available, adjustable power 
production based on natural gas can be used to balance fluctuations in 
renewable energy production and to secure the supply of electricity � With 
planned preventive maintenance and condition monitoring, we ensure 
that our power plants operate reliably to produce the electricity and heat 
customers need �
Power plant availability at a good level
We measure the availability of our CHP and hydropower plants with an 
energy availability indicator � Energy availability is calculated by dividing 
the power plant’s actual production in the period under review by the 
theoretical maximum production. Planned maintenance outages are not 
included in the calculation � If the outage at a CHP plant is longer than 
planned, it is considered a production interruption, which decreases the 
energy availability. The energy availability of our CHP plants in 2019 was, 
on average, 95.9% (2018: 96.4%), outperforming the target of ≥95.0%.
For hydropower plants, outages due to a failure and unplanned or 
prolonged outages decrease the availability factor only if they lead to 
spillage. The energy availability of our hydropower plants was 99.6% 
(2018: 98.5%).
The load factor describing the availability of the Loviisa nuclear power 
plant is among the best in the world for pressurised water reactor power 
plants. The Loviisa nuclear power plant’s load factor in 2019 was 92.4% 
(2018: 88.4%), and Loviisa power plant’s unit 1 set a new production 
record �95.9%
Energy availability of CHP plants 
Target: ≥95.0%Interruptions in heat distribution
Fortum has about 3,100 km of district heating networks in Finland, 
Poland, Norway and the Baltic countries. The aim is to keep interruptions 
in district heat distribution as short as possible by carrying out planned 
and preventive refurbishment and maintenance activities �

 Energy
Hydropower has been used in energy production for centuries � 
Hydropower is a renewable natural resource widely used in the Nordic 
countries and its carbon footprint is small � In addition to electricity 
production, hydropower has key role in ensuring electricity system 
flexibility and security of supply. Water reservoirs can be used for brief, 
one-second adjustments or for season-long regulation. In recent years, 
also large batteries have been deployed for short-term hydropower 
regulating capacity �
Versatile and flexible hydropower
Compared to other small carbon footprint energy production forms, 
like solar, wind and nuclear, the advantage of hydropower is that it can 
be adjusted based on the electricity demand. Wind and solar energy 
production fluctuates based on weather conditions, and nuclear power 
produces mainly base-load power. Hydropower –  especially hydropower 
that utilises reservoirs, in which water is stored behind a dam – ensures 
secure supply of electricity regardless of whether the wind is blowing 
or the sun is shining. Additionally, hydropower can ensure sufficient 
electricity production also during demand peaks �
The flexibility potential of hydropower makes it an important enabler for 
the growth of renewable energy production, like wind power in the Nordic 
countries. Hydropower also contributes to balance in the electricity grid, 
together with of electricity users’ demand response and battery storages � 
This is increasingly more important in a situation where fossil fuel-based 
energy production is decreasing while energy demand is growing as a 
result of the electrification of society. Battery innovation in Sweden
In 2019, Fortum showcased a new, innovative battery project at the 
Forshuvud hydropower plant in Sweden � The plant has been equipped 
with a large set of lithium-ion batteries that have a total storage capacity 
of 6.2 MWh. The project improves the hydropower plant’s ability for short-
term regulation �
The benefits of the innovative project are many. The water flow 
continuously charges the large set of batteries, and the energy stored in 
the batteries can be fed to the grid without delay based on the fluctuation 
in demand � This reduces the wear of the hydropower plant’s mechanical 
parts because the plant turbines and generators are no longer used for 
short-term regulation � The batteries also reduce the need to regulate 
water levels in the waterway. This brings local environmental benefits, like 
less erosion of riverbanks, which is good news for residents along the river 
and for the local ecosystem �Case | Hydropower supports climate change mitigation and security of power supply

Climate change mitigation requires political 
commitment and ambitious actions from different 
players in society. We believe that electrification will 
be a key enabler for decarbonisation in many sectors. 
Electrification mitigates climate change, when energy is 
produced and supplied by low-emission and renewable 
energy sources. There is also an increasing need for 
low-carbon energy, as fossil fuels are being replaced in 
heating and cooling, transport and industry.

Governance
Sustainability is an integral part of Fortum’s strategy � The highest 
decision-making authority on sustainability and climate-related matters is 
with the members of the Board of Directors, who share joint responsibility 
for these matters � The Board of Directors annually approves Group 
performance targets, including sustainability and climate-related targets. 
The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC), members of Fortum Executive 
Management (FEM), and other senior executives support the Board of 
Directors in the decision making in these matters, when necessary. 
The Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Communications, 
has the overall responsibility for sustainability, including also climate-

the Group’s strategy and climate-related targets falls under the strategy 
function. Concrete actions are executed by the line management 
according to the annual planning �
Strategy
Climate change is one of the main drivers behind Fortum’s strategy �  
Our strategy is designed so that Fortum will be successful in  
a decarbonised society � 
The Paris Agreement aims at limiting the global warming to well below 
2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C by the end of the century. 
A central part of the agreement is to strengthen the global response 
to climate change mitigation � Ambitious actions and investments are 
required to ensure the transition to the sustainable and low-carbon 
energy system needed to limit global warming �
Fortum believes that the transformation of the electricity sector is 
making good progress, and, e.g., the EU emissions trading system will 
increasingly steer investments towards CO 2-free production technologies � 
This will accelerate the low-carbon transition in society and create new 
business opportunities, but it alone will not be sufficient for the EU to 
meet the Paris Agreement targets. In December 2019, the European 
Council agreed on the goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, 
although Poland didn’t commit to the timetable in question � This requires 
a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by all sectors. In addition to the 
electricity sector, emissions must be reduced in, e.g., heating and cooling, 
transport and industry, and, at the same time, carbon capture and 
negative emissions must be increased �
Fortum is accelerating the change towards a low-carbon energy 
system, improving resource efficiency and providing smart solutions 
for customers. In the power production value chain, Fortum is focusing 
on growth in CO 2-free hydro, wind and solar power, while efficiently 
operating the existing assets needed for security of supply during the 
energy transition as efficiently as possible.

We are pursuing solutions to decrease the carbon footprint of our 
customers. We also offer new solutions, such as the use of green 
hydrogen produced with renewable energy, batteries and demand 
response, which are necessary in the future low-carbon energy system. 
We are also focusing on the circular economy and resource efficiency 
through waste recycling, material recovery as well as bio-originated 
materials, such as biotextiles.
Scenario analysis
Fortum has applied a scenario analysis framework based on Fortum’s 
assumptions derived from external benchmarks, such as IEA, 
BloombergNEF and IHS Markit, together with internal industry expertise 
in the strategy development. We currently operate with five different 
scenarios describing varying degrees of ambition in climate change 
mitigation, technological development and evolution in the political 
landscape � 
Among the scenarios, the two most optimistic ones in terms of climate 
are consistent with the 1.5 and 2 degrees -pathways. Transition risks are 
most relevant and increase in +1,5–+2°C -scenarios. On the other hand, 
acute and chronic physical risks increase in higher temperature scenarios �
Fortum’s main scenario assumes that Europe’s electricity sector can 
almost fully decarbonise by 2050. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions in 
other sectors is based on Fortum’s scenarios of varying degrees of sector 
integration, where electrification drives the integration of transport, 
heating and cooling, and industrial energy consumption, directly and 
indirectly, through the increased production of green hydrogen.
The pricing of greenhouse gas emissions is a central factor in Fortum’s 
scenarios, and the EU emissions trading system is expected to remain a 
central factor in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, we see a 
clear need globally for more ambitious actions to both reduce emissions 
and improve resource efficiency.Most relevant climate-related risks in Fortum’s scenarios

Emissions trading
About 75% of carbon dioxide emissions from our energy production in the 
Nordic countries, the Baltic countries and Poland are within the sphere of 
the EU emissions trading system (ETS). We had a total of 50 plants in six 
countries within the EU ETS in 2019. Fortum was granted free emission 
allowances corresponding to 0.7 (2018: 0.8) million tonnes. Our carbon 
dioxide emissions within the EU ETS were 2.1 (2018: 2.5) million tonnes. 
In terms of emission allowances, we had a deficit and purchased the 
shortfall of emission allowances from the markets �
We also want to promote the establishment of a global carbon pricing 
and carbon market� We are participating in a number of international 
initiatives promoting the role of business in climate change mitigation � 
These include, for example, the UN Global Compact’s Caring for Climate 
initiative and the World Bank’s Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition � In 
Finland, Fortum is a member of the Climate Leadership Coalition (CLC). 
Towards low-carbon energy production
Fortum’s specific carbon dioxide emissions are among the lowest 
compared to other power companies in Europe. In 2019, 96% (2018: 
96%) of our electricity production in Europe was CO 2-free. Of our total 
electricity production, including the Russian power generation, 59% 
(2018: 57%) was of CO 2-free, i.e. Fortum is still among the low-carbon 
energy utilities. Over the past decades, Fortum has significantly increased 
its annual CO 2-free power production: from around 15 TWh in 1990 to 
45 TWh in 2019. 
In line with the strategy, Fortum targets a multi-gigawatt solar and 
wind portfolio, which is subject to the capital recycling business model. 
The majority of our greenfield investments in Europe and solar power 
investments in India are CO 2-free � In order to enable more investments 
into renewable production, Fortum cooperates with other financial 
investors. In 2019, we invested in new wind power production in the Nordic countries and Russia, as well as in hydropower refurbishments in 
Finland and Sweden �
In Russia, over 90% of our energy production is based on natural 
gas. Since a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions is not possible with 
Fortum’s current Russian production portfolio, Fortum aims to reduce 
emissions by improving energy efficiency. Our new plants in Russia are 
mainly based on CCGT (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine) technology, which 
represents the best available technology in natural gas combustion 
(efficiency 80–85%). 
In 2019, Fortum invested EUR 401 (2018: 278) million in CO 2-free 
production. Investments in hydro, wind and solar power and bioenergy 
totalled EUR 344 (2018: 180) million. Projects under construction 
and decisions on new investments are described in more detail in the 
section4Energy production � 
Fortum’s R&D activities aim at building a platform for future growth 
in, for example, wind and solar power, batteries, demand response, and 
bio-fractionation. To improve resource efficiency, Fortum is also focusing 
on material recovery. In 2019, Fortum spent EUR 67 (2018: 56) million 
on research and development; over 80% of this amount targeted R&D on 
mitigating climate change �Carbon funds
Fortum is a participant in the World Bank’s Prototype Carbon Fund 
(PCF). In 2019, we received a total of about 36,000 Carbon Emission 
Reduction (CER) units from this fund. So far, we have received a total 
of 2,856,000 CER units, and we estimate that we will still receive 
about 13,000 units during the PCF’s operating period. Fortum uses 
the CER units it has received from the PCF to compensate greenhouse 
gas emissions generated by employee air travel � Emissions from 
employee air travel have been compensated since 2007 .

Management of climate-related risks is integrated into Fortum’s risk management framework and follows the same governance and processes as Fortum’s other material risks and uncertainties. Climate-related risks can be divided  
into two categories: transition risks and physical risks. The identified physical risks are generally found in the operational risk category, whereas transition risks are generally longer-term and part of the strategic risk category.
Our climate-related risks are also described in our 4Financials 2019  report in the section Risk management, particularly page 31.

Climate-related opportunities
We believe that the growing awareness and concern about climate 
change will increase the market demand for low-carbon and resource- 
and energy-efficient products and services. We are leveraging our 
know-how in CO 2-free hydro, nuclear, wind and solar power and in 
energy-efficient combined heat and power (CHP) production by offering 
low-carbon energy solutions and services to our customers � 
We also believe that the electrification of transportation, industry 
and services will increase the consumption of low-carbon electricity in 
particular. Business opportunities creating climate benefits are further 
supported by our business area-specific targets.
In building options for significant new businesses, Fortum is focusing 
on the circular economy and resource efficiency through waste recycling 
and recovery and new bio-originated products. Our circular economy 
services utilise waste stream materials as efficiently as possible and 
reduce the formation of greenhouse gases generated from biodegradable 
waste at landfills. Additionally, the use of non-recyclable and non-
recoverable waste in energy production replaces fossil fuel �
The following investments and projects, among others, directly or 
indirectly reducing carbon dioxide emissions were completed in 2019:
• Refurbishments of hydropower plants in Sweden and Finland
• New Pavagada 2 solar power plant in India
• New wind turbines in the Sørfjord wind power park in Norway
Fortum has a business model of capital recycling in its solar and wind 
power portfolio. In line with the model, Fortum sells the majority share in 
its solar and wind power portfolio and releases capital for new solar and 
wind power investments �We also offer our customers a range of energy services and energy 
products to help them improve their energy efficiency and reduce their 
carbon footprint:
• CO 2-free electricity products and carbon-neutral heat products
• Real-time monitoring and optimisation of energy consumption
• Electric vehicle charging solutions
• Solar panel solutions
We are expanding our offering also by investing in start-ups that are 
developing new technologies �
Metrics and targets
Fortum’s Group-level target for specific CO 2 emissions from total energy 
production, five-year average, is ≤200 gCO 2/kWh. The five-year average, 
including 2019, was 186 (2018: 186) gCO 2/kWh, which is below the 
Group-level target of ≤200 gCO 2/kWh. Our specific carbon dioxide 
emissions (Scope 1) from total energy production in 2019 were 189 
(2018: 192) gCO 2/kWh.
In December 2019, Fortum’s Board of Directors approved a new target 
for specific CO 2 emissions from total energy production, applicable for 
2020: ≤180 gCO 2/kWh (one year performance). This target will be revised 
after consolidation of Uniper � The Board of Directors also approved 
inclusion of total CO 2 emissions from energy production in the 20 2 0– 2 0 2 2 
long-term incentive (LTI) plan for key employees and executives. 
Fortum has also evaluated possibilities to establish a science-based 
target for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for its stand-alone 
fleet. However, a science-based target should be set for a minimum of 
five years ahead, so it was not regarded as sensible at this transition 
point �
Our specific carbon dioxide emissions from total electricity production 
(Scope 1) in 2019 were 183 (2018: 186) g/kWh. Our specific

carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production in Europe were 
27 (2018: 26) g/kWh. The specific carbon dioxide emissions from our 
electricity production, measured as gCO 2/kWh, are low compared to 
other major European electricity producers. Our specific emissions in 
2018 were one of the smallest among European electricity utilities. 
European reference data for 2019 is not yet available. 
In the calculation of electricity production’s specific emissions, 
CHP plant emissions have been allocated for electricity and heat using 
the efficiency method presented in the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol 
guidelines, with heat production efficiency of 90% and electricity 
production efficiency of 40%. 
The boundary for specific carbon dioxide emissions generated from 
electricity production differs from other environmental 4reporting principles � The figures include also figures from Fortum’s share in associated companies 
and joint ventures that sell their production to the owners at cost. This 
electricity production is based on hydro, wind and nuclear power, and the 
production doesn’t cause direct carbon dioxide emissions.
Fortum also has a Group-level target to achieve annual energy-
efficiency improvement of ≥1,900 GWh by 2020 compared to 2012. 
Our energy-efficiency improvements are described in more detail in the

1Greenhouse gas emissions
Fortum has defined targets and key performance indicators for 
climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and 
risk management process. Greenhouse gas emissions are defined and 
reported according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol guidelines. 
Our greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 totalled 25.2 (2018: 26.4) 
million tonnes. Scope 1 emissions were 19.3 (2018: 20.2) million tonnes, 
Scope 2 emissions 0.1 (2018: 0.1) million tonnes, and Scope 3 emissions 
5.8 (2018: 6.1) million tonnes. The figures for the comparison years for 
greenhouse gas emissions have not been adjusted, due to insufficient 
data �
Direct greenhouse gas emissions – Scope 1
The majority of our greenhouse gas emissions are generated from the 
use of fossil fuels in electricity and heat production � A small amount of 
emissions is generated from the use of company vehicles. Our direct 
CO 2 emissions were 19.1 (2018: 20.1) million tonnes, and our direct 
greenhouse gas emissions were 19.3 (2018: 20.2) million CO 2-equivalent 
tonnes. The share of carbon dioxide emissions from our direct 
greenhouse gas emissions was 99%. Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions  
accounted for about 77% of our total greenhouse gas emissions.
Of the direct carbon dioxide emissions, 85% (2018: 84%) originated 
from the Russian operations, 7% (2018: 8%) from Finland and 4% 
(2018: 4%) from Poland. Direct CO 2 emissions decreased primarily 
because of the decreased power and heat production � Fortum’s direct 
biogenic carbon dioxide emissions were 1.6 (2018: 1.5) million tonnes.

The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions covers carbon dioxide 
(CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), fluorinated hydrocarbons 
(HFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6). Carbon dioxide emissions as well 
as methane and nitrous oxide emissions have been calculated on the 
basis of plant-specific fuel data. The amounts of HFC compounds and SF 6 
are reported on the basis of the amounts of gas added to the equipment�  
Specific emission factors of gases are based on IPCC publications.
Indirect greenhouse gas emissions – Scope 2
Greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity purchased 
for our own use were 84,200 (2018: 92,200) tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent. Carbon dioxide emissions accounted for 92% of Scope 2 
greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions accounted 
for 0.3% of our total greenhouse gas emissions.The electricity used in electric boilers in Norway has been added to 
the Scope 2 emissions calculation. The Scope 2 emissions calculation for 
2019 also takes into consideration lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.
About 94% of the market-based Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 
have been estimated based on data from electricity suppliers. Scope 2 
greenhouse gas emissions in Russia have been estimated based on 
a country-specific breakdown of electricity production and emission 
factors �

Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions – Scope 3
The majority of our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are caused by 
the purchases of goods and services, investments and the production 
and transportation of fuels � The transportation of waste received from 
customers also creates greenhouse gas emissions in our circular economy 
business. Other operations (e.g. employee travel and waste management) 
accounted for 0.4% of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.Our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were an estimated 5.8 
(2018: 6.1) million tonnes. Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions accounted 
for about 23% of our total greenhouse gas emissions. We estimate that 
all our Scope 3 emissions come from fossil energy sources.

We report Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the 
requirements of the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and 
Reporting standard � The volumes describing the scope of the various 
activities have been obtained from our monitoring and reporting systems � 
About 7% (2018: 12%) of the purchases were excluded from the 
purchasing categories defined by Fortum’s Procurement function, due 
to insufficient reporting. The emissions for these are estimated with 
the average emissions factor of the specified purchasing categories.
The specific emissions factors used in calculating the greenhouse gas 
emissions are based on different literature sources � We updated the 
emissions factors in 2018, so the calculated greenhouse gas emissions 
are not fully comparable with 2017 .
4Fortum’s CDP Climate Change 2019 response
Espoo Clean Heat
The use of coal for energy production will end in Finland in May 2029, as stipulated 
by law � We want to be forerunners and will discontinue the use of coal in Espoo’s 
district heating network already in 2025. We and the City of Espoo have together 
committed to carbon-neutral district heating in the district heating network 
operating in the Espoo, Kauniainen and Kirkkonummi regions in the 2020s. The 
accelerated project for carbon-neutrality is called Espoo Clean Heat. The Espoo 
Clean Heat concept is based on replacing fossil fuels with smart and flexible 
solutions that utilise CO 2-free electricity, excess heat, geothermal energy, and 
biofuels in energy production �
Recovery of excess heat from industrial processes
Fortum recovers excess heat from many sources, such as treated wastewater, 
office premises and data centres. Data centres are one of the world’s fastest 
growing energy-intensive sectors and they offer interesting opportunities for 
recovering heat. Currently, 99% of data centre excess heat globally goes unused, 
which is a huge energy loss. A data centre’s energy efficiency also significantly 
improves if the excess heat is recovered for district heating use.
As an energy architect and energy partner for data centres, Fortum is creating 
the conditions for having data centres in the Nordic countries. In 2019, Fortum 
started development work related to two big data centre sites in the Espoo district 
heating network area; the aim is to create the prerequisites for a hyperscale data 
centre operator. One 100-MW data centre could heat up to 35% of the region’s 
district heating network, which would be a significant step towards the target of 
making district heating carbon-neutral during the 2020s.

Received and treated waste from customers in 2019 Challenges for rapidly growing major cities and growth centres include not only 
the management of emissions, but also growth in waste volumes. Reliable waste 
management and resource efficiency are important in a sustainable society. We offer 
customers sustainable circular economy services and expert solutions. We also recover 
by-products and wastes generated in our own energy production whenever possible.
Waste received from customers
Fortum’s aim is to promote the transition towards a more comprehensive circular economy and resource efficiency. 
By circular economy, we mean that materials are utilised as efficiently as possible and hazardous materials are 
removed from circulation � The aim is to make new raw material from waste whenever possible and to keep 
valuable materials in circulation �
Our circular economy business is expanding 
In autumn 2019, Fortum commissioned Finland’s first ash refinery in Pori. About one-third of the fly ash generated 
at Finnish waste incineration plants is salt. Pursuant to the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive, waste 
containing salt can no longer be piled in landfills, as was done earlier, because in exceptional conditions the salt 
can dissolve into the environment. Also, the indirect carbon dioxide emissions are high. 
In the ash refinery process, the heavy metals are bonded together with the ash and then the ash is taken to a 
landfill. The salt, that has been washed from the ash in the first phase of the process, is released into the sea with 
the discharge water � The washing water’s impacts on the seawater are estimated to be minimal � The goal is that in 
the future the salt can be recovered and utilised, for example, as road salt. 
In early 2019, the new Zabrze CHP plant in Poland was commissioned into operation. In addition to coal, the 
plant also combusts refuse-derived fuel (RDF), and waste accounts for about 40% of the fuel use. 
In 2019, we also started the use of REcovered Fuel (REF) in Finland at the Järvenpää power plant. The REF is 
delivered from our Riihimäki plant.Circular economy

1) Includes received waste from customers and also ash from waste incinerationOur waste management services
We offer waste management services for customers in the Nordic 
countries, Lithuania and Poland. As much of the waste stream as possible 
received from customers is recycled, reused or recovered as raw material.
Waste that is unsuitable for recycling or reuse as a material is 
incinerated in our waste-to-energy plants � This reduces the use of virgin 
fossil or renewable fuels in electricity and heat production � Waste that is 
unsuitable for recovery is disposed of at landfilling sites.
In 2019, we received a total of 2.2 (2018: 2.2) million tonnes of 
waste from our customers, 62% (2018: 67%) of which was recovered in 
waste -to-energy plants. Of the waste received, about 1.6 (2018: 1.6) 
million tonnes was non-hazardous waste, with ash accounting for 11% 
(2018: 12%) and contaminated soil for 10% (2018: 9%). We also received 
about 620,000 (2018: 620,000) tonnes of hazardous waste from our 
customers; ash accounted for 12% (2018: 13%) and contaminated soil for 
12% (2018: 10%).
Recovery of materials
Various types of waste can be reused as raw materials. In 2019, of the 
waste received from our customers, we recovered as materials about 
820,000 (2018: 656,000) tonnes; various environmental construction 
materials accounted for 63% (2018: 64%) of that amount, recoverable 
ash accounted for 18% (2018: 20%), and processed raw materials and 
products accounted for 11% (2018: 11%). 
The material recovery rate of the waste was 67% (2018: 59%). In 
addition, about 182,000 (2018: 225,000) tonnes of recoverable materials 
originated at Fortum’s own power and heat plants �

Waste and by-products from our energy production 
Ash is a by-product generated in the use of fuels in power and heat 
production, and gypsum and other desulphurisation products are 
by-products of flue-gas desulphurisation. Ash and desulphurisation 
products account for a more than 90% share, on average, of the 
by-products and waste from our energy production � 
The maintenance of power and heat plants generates scrap metal and 
other conventional industrial waste and, to a smaller extent, waste oil 
and other hazardous waste � We aim for the highest possible utilisation 
and recovery of by-products and waste � The waste management service 
providers we use are properly licensed and reliable waste management 
companies � 
In addition to conventional industrial waste, the Loviisa nuclear power 
plant also generates radioactive waste, which we treat in accordance 
with the requirements of Finnish nuclear energy legislation � The volume of 
radioactive waste generated is small, but special solutions are needed in 
its treatment and final disposal. 
The total volume of by-products and waste generated at all Fortum’s 
power and heat plants in 2019 was about 740,000 (2018: 770,000) 
tonnes. Of this volume, about 47% (2018: 50%) was recovered. With the 
growth of our circular economy business, the use of waste-derived fuel 
has increased and, consequently, the volume of by-products. 
Ash and gypsum as by-products 
Ash is created in the combustion of all solid fuels. About 65% of the ash 
from our plants operating in Europe is utilised as a raw material, e.g., for 
the construction industry, road construction and soil improvement, and 
as backfill. Ash from the power plants in Russia is stored in ash basins, 
because there is no demand for wet ash sludge in Russia �
Coal-fired power plants generate either a wet or semi-dry 
desulphurisation by-product � Gypsum created as a by-product in the 
wet desulphurisation process at the Meri-Pori power plant in Finland is 
suitable for use as raw material for the construction industry � We are continuously developing activities that increase the proportion of 
waste materials kept in circulation:
• We produce 4recycled plastic  out of plastic packaging waste received 
from customers � 
• We process and recycle 4metals  separated from customers’ waste 
and from the boiler slag in customers’ energy production � We recycle 
scrap metals generated in the maintenance activities of also our own 
power and heat plants �
• We pick up and process customers’ waste oils to be refined and 
recycled as industrial lubrication oils �
• We process slag, sand, sludge, dredging masses and slurry from 
energy production and other industries for reuse in various types of 
environmental construction and earthwork projects.

67%Hazardous waste treatment
We offer solutions to treat 4hazardous waste, we take hazardous waste 
out of circulation in a sustainable manner and we clean the hazardous 
substances from materials that end up in recycling. At the same time, we 
produce energy and ensure the safe final disposal of waste. 
High-temperature incineration is the best available solution for the 
destruction of hazardous substances � We have three high-temperature 
incineration plants: in Riihimäki, Finland; Kumla, Sweden; and Nyborg, 
Denmark. At these facilities, about 347 ,000 (2018: 359,000) tonnes 
of hazardous waste and, additionally, about 321,000 (2018: 320,000) 
tonnes of non-hazardous waste were incinerated in 2019, producing 
electricity and district heating for the surrounding areas � 
Contaminated soil
In 2019, we received and treated about 236,000 (2018: 209,000) tonnes 
of contaminated soil from our customers. We directed metal, rocks, 
concrete and wood, sieved from the soil for reuse as raw materials. 
Soil that is suitable for environmental construction is used at our own 
construction sites and industrial waste treatment centres �

In 2019, 100% (2018: 99.5%) of the gypsum was recovered. The 
desulphurisation product created at the Suomenoja power plant is not 
suitable for utilisation � 
In 2019, about 700,500 (2018: 730,000) tonnes of ash, 1,600 
(2018: 3,300) tonnes of gypsum, and 13,200 (2018: 11,600) tonnes of 
the other desulphurisation product were generated. 26% of the ash was 
generated at Russian plants, 19% in Finland and 15% in Poland. The ash 
recovery rate was 48% (2018: 51%). By-products that cannot be utilised 
are transported to the appropriate final disposal at landfilling sites or in 
Russia to ash basins � 
The reported volumes of ash and gypsum from our European power plants 
are based on the weighing of the truckloads � Ash volumes at our Russian 
power plants are calculated on the basis of the ash content of the coal �

Conventional and hazardous waste
Conventional waste generated during the operation and maintenance of 
power and heat plants is sorted, and waste that can be recycled, such 
as metal, is sent for further processing. Hazardous waste is delivered to 
licensed hazardous waste treatment facilities � 
In 2019, the power and heat plants generated a total of about 32,400 
(2018: 34,700) tonnes of waste, about 1,300 (2018: 1,700) tonnes of 
which was hazardous waste. Additionally, about 13,100 tonnes of soil was 
removed for disposal in Norway � 
In 2019, the demolition project at the Inkoo power plant generated 
a total of about 38,400 (2018: 24,400) tonnes of waste, about 3,000 
(2018: 1,000) tonnes of this was hazardous waste. Over 90% of the 
demolition waste was recovered � The reported volumes of non-hazardous and hazardous waste are based mainly on the information provided by 
the waste management companies �

Radioactive waste
The Loviisa nuclear power plant’s low-level radioactive maintenance 
waste is disposed of in Loviisa’s repository. In 2019, 14 (2018: 13.9) 
tonnes of low-level radioactive waste and 12 m3 of intermediate-
level radioactive waste went into final disposal. Intermediate-level 
radioactive liquid is generated mainly from spent ion exchange resins and 
wastewater from the controlled area � Liquid waste is processed into solid 
form at the solidification plant for liquid radioactive waste before final 
disposal in Loviisa’s repository. The final disposal of intermediate-level 
waste started in December 2019.
High-level spent nuclear fuel is stored in an interim storage at the 
Loviisa power plant site. In 2019, 21.9 (2018: 20.3) tonnes of spent 
nuclear fuel was removed from Loviisa power plant’s reactors. 2.7 (2018: 
2.6) g/MWh of spent fuel was generated per produced energy unit. 
Fortum and Teollisuuden Voima have established Posiva Oy to handle 
the technical implementation of the final disposal of the spent fuel, and 
final disposal is scheduled to begin at Olkiluoto in Eurajoki in the 2020s. 
Final disposal of Loviisa’s spent nuclear fuel will begin in the 2040s.

 Circular economy
Emissions
Energy production and other production operations 
generate emissions to the environment, such as to 
air and water. We aim to control emissions caused 
by our operations and to reduce their environmental 
impacts by using technological solutions and cleaning 
technology.  
 
At the Group level, we monitor the number of major 
EHS incidents, such as leaks and environmental 
permit violations. These, in part, reflect the quality of 
environmental management.
Emissions to air
Greenhouse gases that accelerate global climate change are generated 
primarily from the use of fossil fuels and the combustion of fossil-based 
waste � Flue-gas emissions causing local environmental and health effects 
are generated from all combustion � 
We aim to reduce impacts on air quality
Nitrogen oxides (NO x) are generated from the nitrogen contained in the 
fuel and in the combustion air. Sulphur dioxide (SO 2) is generated from 
the sulphur that is an impurity in, for example, coal, peat and oil. Particle 
emissions are fine-grained ash generated primarily in the combustion of 
solid fuels and waste. Depending on the origin of the fuel and waste, the 
particles contain various heavy metals � 
It is possible to decrease nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and particle 
emissions through fuel choices, combustion technology, and various 
flue-gas cleaning technologies. Fortum has world-class know-how in 
combustion technology � We aim to reduce emissions to air from our 
own operations, and we also offer solutions to reduce our customers’ flue-gas emissions. We have delivered combustion technology solutions 
to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions to many customers’ power plants. In 
2019, we implemented projects to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions of 
customers’ coal- and oil-fired boilers in Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic 
and India � 
In Finland, our Meri-Pori and Suomenoja power plants are equipped 
with a desulphurisation plant. Our waste incineration plants located in 
Riihimäki, Finland; Kumla, Sweden; Nyborg, Denmark; Oslo, Norway, and 
Klaipeda, Lithuania are equipped with efficient flue-gas cleaning systems. 
Harmful emissions to air are minimised with various filters and scrubbers 
selected on the basis of the waste to be incinerated � 
Our carbon dioxide emissions are reported in the section 4Climate �
Flue-gas emission requirements 
The EU has set very strict limits for flue-gas emissions; meeting the 
requirements necessitates the use of best available technology (BAT). 
Emissions limits became stricter when the Industrial Emissions Directive 
came into force in 2016. Fortum’s power plants operate in compliance 
with the terms of their environmental permits, and, for the most part, the 
plants also meet the new emissions requirements �
During the past five years, we have reduced SO 2 emissions in Europe 
by nearly 40%. The demolition of the Inkoo coal condensing power plant 
and the minimal electricity production of the Meri-Pori power plant 
and its transition to peak-load reserve capacity in 2020 contributed to 
the reduced emissions in Finland. We have also reduced SO 2 emissions 
in Poland with the commissioning of the new Zabrze CHP plant and, 
correspondingly, the decommissioning of the old Zabrze and Bytom 
CHP plants.
Particle emissions have also decreased in Europe by about 15% 
primarily as a result of the commissioning of the new Zabrze plant and 
the decommissioning of the old plants. The old Zabrze and Bytom plants 
will be removed completely from operating capacity after 2022.In 2019–2020, we will invest in Poland in systems reducing NO x and 
SO x emissions at the Rejtana heat plant. We also invested in a flue-gas 
cleaning system at the Czestochowa CHP plant, and the intention is to 
complete the investments in 2021.
In 2019, we continued the optimisation of combustion at the 
Suomenoja power plant in Finland to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions 
and to boost the operational efficiency of the desulphurisation plant.
Emissions at Russian power plants are limited in accordance with 
Russian legislation. Upon enactment of new legislation in Russia, the 
emissions regulations may become stricter � 
In 2019, our Chelyabinsk CHP-3 and Tyumen CHP-1 and CHP-2 
plants as well as our Nyagan power plant commissioned a system to 
continuously monitor flue-gas emissions, such as, among others, NO x 
and CO 2 emissions, via the Internet. A similar system to monitor flue-gas 
emissions is in use also at the Chelyabinsk CHP-2 and CHP-4 plants.
Our flue-gas emissions
Our nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions were 24,900 (2018: 26,100) tonnes, 
our sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions were 14,900 (2018: 16,800) tonnes, 
and our particle emissions 11,700 (2018: 9,600) tonnes. 82% (2018: 80%) 
of nitrogen oxide, 81% (2018: 75%) of sulphur dioxide, and 98% 
(2018: 97%) of particle emissions originated from Russian operations.

comply with the permit limits. The Chelyabinsk CHP-3 plant investment 
project is estimated to be completed in 2022, the Chelyabinsk CHP-2 
plant project in late 2024, and the Argayash CHP plant project in 2026.
Environmental non-compliances 
At the Group level, we monitor the number of major EHS incidents; in 
2019, the Group-level target was ≤18 major EHS incidents. Significant 
environmental incidents include spills and leaks of over 100 litres into 
the environment, significant environmental permit violations, and other 
environmental non-compliances that have a significant impact on 
environment. In 2019, major EHS incidents didn’t include the exceedance 
of wastewater emissions limits in Russia arising from environmental 
permit changes � 
In 2019, there were 11 (2018: 18) major EHS incidents; six (2018: 6) of 
these were significant environmental incidents: leaks of over 100 litres into 
the environment were four (2018: 4) and environmental permit violations 
were two (2018: 2). 
Additionally, there were three (2018: 11) fires, one (2018: 0) explosion, 
and one INES (International Nuclear Event Scale) level 1 incident. There 
were no other major EHS incidents (2018: 1). 
Spills and leaks into the environment
There were two incidents of refrigerant leaks at the Suomenoja heat 
pump plant in Finland. One of the leaks was to air and caused by a seal 11
Major EHS incidents

offloaded at the port. A technical malfunction was the cause of an oil 
leak to water at a hydropower plant in Sweden � The incidents have 
been investigated to develop preventive maintenance activities and to 
determine the corrective actions. The incidents did not have significant 
environmental impacts �
Environmental permit violations
At the Kumla waste incineration plant, untreated wastewater got into 
a trench and further into a waterway when the wastewater treatment 
plant’s capacity was exceeded during a period of heavy rain. The incident 
has been investigated to determine the corrective actions, and the 
incident did not have significant environmental impacts. The Suomenoja 
power plant experienced an electrostatic precipitator malfunction that 
resulted in an exceedance of the particle emissions limit. The incident did 
not have a material impact on air quality �
4Business ethics and compliance
4Occupational and operational safetyThe most significant source of particle emissions, 6,300 (2018: 4,900) 
tonnes, was the Argayash CHP power plant in Russia. The wet flue-gas 
cleaning system for particle emissions at the Argayash CHP plant has 
helped to cut the power plant’s particle emissions by half during the past 
five years. 
At least the reporting of nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and particle 
emissions from our European power plants is based on continuous 
measurements. Other flue-gas emissions data is based on discontinuous 
measurements or are calculated using fuel consumption data and specific 
emission factors. Specific emission factors are based on measurements 
taken at regular intervals, on information from the equipment supplier, or 
on regulatory norms �
Emissions to water
Wastewater generated at power plants and other production facilities 
is treated either at the plant’s own wastewater treatment plant and 
discharged into a water system or it is piped to a municipal wastewater 
treatment plant for further processing. Even after treatment, plant 
wastewater may contain solids, nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphor, and 
heavy metals � 
Wastewater effluents can impact local water quality as well as the 
nutrient and oxygen balance of the water system. In 2019, about 1.3 
(2018: 1.0) tonnes of oil were released into water systems through 
wastewater �
At the Argayash CHP plant and the Chelyabinsk CHP-2 plant in Russia, 
the wet method is used to pump ash from power plants into ash ponds � 
Some of the water from the ponds is recycled back to the power plant 
and some is released into a water system after sedimentation � 
In 2019, the Chelyabinsk CHP-2 and CHP-3 plants, and the Argayash 
CHP plant had temporary permit limits for wastewater discharges � At the

Water
We use water mainly as cooling water in our condensing 
power pants. Water is also a prerequisite for Fortum’s 
hydropower production. Our responsibility for water 
use is related not only to water volume and availability, 
but also to its quality and the aquatic habitat. We are 
improving the efficiency of our own water use, and we 
offer services also to our customers for the treatment, 
analysis, purification and utilisation of their waste and 
sludge waters and other severely polluted waters. 
We use water within the limits set by our plants’ environmental and 
other permits. Permit regulations affect, e.g., the water intake volume, 
the quality of discharge water, and discharges and water levels at hydro 
power plants. Additionally, we carry out water-related local measures 
in order to take into consideration also the needs of other water users � 
Collaboration with local communities, municipalities, authorities and 
research institutes is important in the implementation of these measures � 
In our supply chain water is used especially in fuel production, but we 
estimate that our own water use is more significant than the water use in 
our supply chain �
Risks and opportunities related to water use 
The risks related to Fortum’s water availability are, based on our 
assessment, relatively small. The majority of our water withdrawal is 
seawater for cooling at condensing power plants � In most cases we don’t 
consume water in our operations; it is discharged into the same water 
system from which it was withdrawn. 15% of Fortum’s water withdrawal is 
in Russia, Poland and India in water-stressed regions, where, by definition, 
water use is generally large compared to the water resources available � 
In water-stressed regions, the risks may be related to water availability, 
increased cost of water, or restrictions in power production. With efficient water management in hydropower production we can 
produce electricity at the right time, and manage the impacts on the 
environment and on stakeholders � Hydropower is good regulating power 
that enables other renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power, 
to be added to the grid. In Sweden, implementation of the EU Water 
Framework directive will reduce the country’s total amount of hydropower 
production by about 2% at most. Fortum is a participant in the joint 
hydropower environmental fund of companies operating in Sweden, 
which is used to fund environmental measures and to compensate for 
production losses so that the environmental benefits are maximised and 
the impact on the renewable energy production system is minimised � 
Fortum is systematically reducing risks related to dam safety � 
A long-term programme is in place for improving the surveillance of the 
condition of dams and for securing the discharge capacity in extreme 
flood situations. 
In our operations we are preparing for changes in water availability 
and hydrological conditions also in the future as the climate changes � The 
preparation is related to, for example, production planning, investments, 
dam safety, flood protection, the rise in the cooling water temperature as 
well as decrease in biomass availability � 
In hydropower production planning we are preparing for climate 
change by taking into consideration changes in precipitation and 
temperature and extreme weather phenomena, which can cause 
droughts or flooding. We are also monitoring the need for adjustments 
to regulation permits with changes in seasonal variation as a result of 
climate change � 
Improving the efficiency of water use at our power plants can reduce 
environmental impacts, generate cost savings, ensure the acceptance of 
our operation, and ensure the supply of water also for other purposes and 
for other users � Water withdrawal and forms of water use 
The majority of our power and heat production using water is located in 
the Nordic countries, Russia, Poland and the Baltic countries. The Baltic 
Sea and local freshwater systems are our most important water sources � 
Brackish water of the Baltic Sea is reported here as seawater. Additionally, 
municipal tap water is used at CHP plants and in waste treatment 
services �
Our water withdrawal in 2019 was about 2,090 (2018: 2,140) million 
m3, of which seawater accounted for about 70%. We recycled 13 
(2018: 13) million m3 of water. The reported water withdrawal, water use 
and discharge volumes are based on measurements and on calculations 
of water consumption �

Cooling water in energy production
Condensing power production requires large volumes of cooling water � 
Cooling water accounts about 94% of our water withdrawal. Fortum 
has two condensing power plants in Finland: the Loviisa nuclear power 
plant and the Meri-Pori power plant, which will transition to peak-load 
reserve capacity in 2020. Both use direct seawater cooling. No water 
is consumed in the cooling process, and water withdrawn from the sea 
is discharged back into the sea, albeit at a warmer temperature. The 
thermal load discharged into water systems with cooling water was 
16 (2018: 16) TWh, of which 98% from the Loviisa nuclear power plant. 
The Loviisa nuclear power plant withdrew and discharged back into 
the sea 1,380 (2018: 1,311) million m3 of cooling water � Temperature 
measurements indicate that the cooling water has increased the 
temperature of surface water by 1–2°C within a 1–2 kilometre radius 
from the discharge point�  
In Russia, Fortum has the Nyagan condensing power plant, which uses 
river water for cooling. The plant also uses cooling towers, in which some 
of the cooling water evaporates into the atmosphere �
Condensing power is occasionally produced also at our CHP plants � In 
most cases, the cooling water is withdrawn from a local water system, such as a river or lake � Several CHP production plants in Russia and 
Poland use cooling towers �
Process water 
A power plant needs water in the water-steam cycle when electricity 
is generated with a steam turbine. Because of leaks in the pipes, 
occasionally water must be added to the water-steam cycle � Water is 
also needed in power plant auxiliary processes, for example in flue-gas 
cleaning with wet scrubber technology, and in radioactive waste handling 
and storage at nuclear power plants �
Water is also used in processes at waste treatment facilities. In 2019, 
we started using air cooling at the Kumla plant in Sweden in the cooling 
of a waste-fired furnace. Air cooling reduces water consumption by at 
least 150,000 m3 a year , which is a significant decrease in the Kumla 
plant’s water consumption � 
District heating water
Fortum is a major supplier of district heat in Finland, Poland, Norway 
and the Baltic countries. Fortum has a total of about 3,100 kilometres of 
district heat pipes � Water is used as the heat transfer medium in district 
heating. Because of leaks in district heating pipelines, make-up water 
must be occasionally fed into district heating networks � The volume 
of make-up water for Fortum’s district heating networks in 2019 was 
0.5 (2018: 9) million m3� The make-up water for the district heating 
networks decreased due to the divestment of the Russian district heating 
networks �
Hydropower production
Fortum produces hydropower from water flowing in rivers in Finland and 
Sweden. Our power plants are typically located in big rivers that have no 
problems in terms of water supply � We do not produce hydropower in 
water-stressed areas. Water is not consumed in hydropower production, 
the water quality is not changed, and it is not typically directed to another water system. However, the water system is often regulated for 
hydropower production, and the regulation changes the water flow and 
level patterns compared to their natural state � The water use-related 
environmental projects implemented with stakeholder groups are 
reported in the section 4Corporate citizenship � 
We have precise knowledge of the water situation in those waterways 
where we produce hydropower, and we use real-time hydrological 
forecasts in production planning. Fortum doesn’t report river flows as a 
hydropower production-related water withdrawal � 
We farm and stock fish to offset impacts of hydropower production. 
The majority of the fresh water withdrawn for fish farming is returned into 
the bodies of water with only a slight change in its properties � Discharged 
water is purified, when necessary, and its nutrient content is monitored 
in line with permit conditions. The new fish farm facility commissioned 
in Sweden uses significantly less water than the previous facility, so our 
water withdrawal for fish farming decreased in 2019.
Our water use in water-stressed areas 
According to the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, of Fortum’s power 
plants the four Chelyabinsk CHP plants and the Argayash CHP plant in 
Russia as well as the Czestochowa CHP plant in Poland are located in 
an area with a high (40–80%) water-stress level, and the Pavagada 2 
solar power plant in India is in an area with an extremely high (> 80 %) 
water-stress level. Our water withdrawal in water-stressed areas was 323 
(2018: 307) million m3, which was about 15% (2018: 14%) of our total 
water withdrawal. 99.9% of the water withdrawal in water-stressed areas 
is in Russia, 0.1% in Poland and 0.00004% in India.

All the Chelyabinsk CHP plants use cooling water towers, which reduces 
the amount of water needed for cooling �
The Argayash CHP plant withdraws cooling and process water from a 
nearby lake � The water volume of the lake can be maintained with water 
pumped in from another lake. Until 2017 , the amount of additional water 
pumped in wasn’t sufficient and the water level decreased significantly. 
In 2017–2018, we were allowed to increase the amount of pumped water, 
and the water level rose to a sufficient level. Fortum has an ongoing 
investment project to improve water use efficiency in ash processing. 
The investment project was developed and received regulatory approval 
in 2019. When the investment project is completed in 2026, water will be 
returned to the plant’s production process, thereby reducing the amount 
of water withdrawal �
Water is used at the Czestochowa CHP plant as process water and, in 
summer, for cooling. Air cooling is also used for cooling.
 In water-stressed areas in Russia and Poland we recycled 5 (2018: 6) 
million m3 of water �
Even though our water use in India is minimal, we aim to reduce water 
use in the country suffering from water stress � We use robotic waterless 
cleaning solutions to clean solar panels. At the end of 2019, 54% of 
Fortum’s solar capacity (including co-owned plant) in India were cleaned 
using robotic waterless cleaning; the target is to increase the share to 
90% by the end of 2020. In 2018, Fortum sold its majority share in the 
Indian solar power plants � Thus our water withdrawal in water-stressed areas in India covers only the Pavagada 2 solar plant commissioned in 
2019 and which uses groundwater. At the Pavagada 2 power plant, we 
use waterless solar panel cleaning on 92% of the panels.
Water discharge 
We pipe the majority of cooling water back into the same water system 
from which the water was withdrawn. In 2019, the water discharge 
was 2,017 (2018: 2,063) million m3, 3% of which was process water 
and wastewater and the rest was cooling water. About 55% of the 
process water and wastewater is discharged water from fish farms. 
97% of the process water and wastewater was purified, when needed, 
and discharged back into the environment; 3% was piped to municipal 
wastewater treatment plants � The discharged water in water-stressed 
areas is mainly cooling water released into fresh surface water � Emissions 
into water are reviewed in the section 4Emissions to water �

Water consumption 
Our water consumption includes cooling water that has evaporated from 
cooling water towers in Russia and Poland, water leakage from district 
heating networks, water used in power plant and other production 
plant processes, water used to move ash in Russia and water used to 
clean solar panels. In 2019, our own water consumption was about 60 
(2018: 68) million m3� We estimate water consumption as the difference 
between water withdrawal and water discharge � Fortum’s own water 
consumption doesn’t include the 7 million m3 of water supplied to 
external customers or the approximately 10 million m3 of water leaked 
from the district heating networks owned by others � 
In water-stressed areas in Russia, Poland and India, our water 
consumption was about 40 (2018: 44) million m3�

 Water
Biodiversity 
The degradation of biodiversity is one of the biggest 
environmental problems globally. We need to know 
our impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and 
ecosystem services to be able to assess the related 
risks and opportunities. 
Our impacts on biodiversity 
Our impacts on biodiversity are primarily related to Fortum’s hydropower 
production operations in Finland and Sweden � Construction of 
hydropower and water regulation related to hydropower alter the 
conditions in water systems and thus impact locally the diversity of the 
aquatic habitat and, in particular, the fish population. Emissions from 
fossil fuel-based energy production may decrease local biodiversity, 
especially in Russia, where most of our fossil-based production is located.
Indirect impacts may be caused by, for example, large-scale 
procurement of biomass for use as fuel or raw material as well as the 
procurement of other fuels. However, our production of carbon dioxide-
free energy replaces fossil fuel-based energy production and thus 
mitigates climate change, which is globally one of the greatest threats to 
biodiversity �
Our responsibility for biodiversity 
Fortum’s4Biodiversity Manual defines the company’s principles 
related to biodiversity. According to the manual, biodiversity issues are 
systematically considered as part of our environmental management 
processes and our operations throughout Fortum � The manual contains 
specific instructions for biodiversity issues in current operations, 
new projects and the supply chain, as well as for reporting and 
communication. In 2019, we updated our 4Biodiversity Action Plan , 
the content of which has been designed based on the voluntary 
environmental measures compiled by the Generation division � The Biodiversity Action Plan describes Fortum’s goals, responsibilities, 
timelines and partners for biodiversity projects.
We aim to improve biodiversity in connection with our operations, 
we carry out biodiversity-related projects, and we collaborate with our 
stakeholders in projects. We also assess the impacts our new projects 
have on biodiversity. Additionally, we offset and reduce the biodiversity 
impacts of hydropower production. In 2019, we carried out our fish 
obligations valued at EUR 2.4 million and several types of voluntary 
environmental projects valued at EUR 570,000.
Managing impacts in the supply chain
We manage the impacts of our fuel procurement on biodiversity by 
using international certification and assessment systems. We pay special 
attention to the procurement of wood-based biomass and coal �
Biomass sustainability criteria have been actively debated in recent 
years particularly at the EU level as part of the updating of the Renewable 
Energy Directive. Fortum has called for EU-wide, harmonised and binding 
sustainability criteria for all bioenergy. The sustainability criteria defined 
in the Renewable Energy Directive approved in 2018 are in line with 
Fortum’s position � Sustainability of biomass is assessed on a risk-basis 
and primarily country-specifically. Certification systems offered by third 
parties can also be used to show sustainability � The implementation of 
the directive has started in member countries � 
Certified wood-based biomass fuel originates from sustainably 
managed forests in which the preservation of biodiversity has been a 
focus. We annually collect data on the share of certified wood-based 
biomass fuel used in our power plants in Finland, Norway, Poland and the 
Baltic countries. In 2019, we improved the Chain of Custody management 
system for wood-based biomass fuel by strengthening supplier risk 
assessments � 
Fortum is a member of the Bettercoal initiative and uses the Bettercoal 
Code and tools in assessing the sustainability of the coal supply chain � 
Biodiversity aspects related to coal mining are covered in Bettercoal assessments. Assessment criteria are related to, e.g., preventing the 
disappearance or fragmentation of habitats, combating invasive species, 
and preventing adverse hydrological changes, nutrient accumulation 
and environmental pollution. By the end of 2020, we have committed to 
purchasing 70% of coal from suppliers whose mines have undergone a 
Bettercoal assessment � 
4Sustainable fuel purchasing
Habitat restoration and other projects 
Most of our habitat restorations and other projects improving biodiversity 
are related to hydropower production. Most of the projects described 
below are included in our Biodiversity Action Plan � Additional information 
about our hydropower-related projects supporting biodiversity is available 
on our4website � 
Innovative solutions for migrating fish 
To strengthen the lifecycle of fish we use a number of solutions, like fish 
stocking, habitat restoration, various types of fishways, and trap and 
transport systems to transfer fish over the dams. In 2019 at the Spjutmo 
power plant on the River Dalälven in Sweden, we started using a Finnish 
fishway innovation called Fishheart. Fishheart is a hydraulic fishway that 
uses water pressure to get fish around migration obstacles. In 2020, we 
will begin using Whoossh equipment at the Forshaga power plant on 
the River Klarälven in Sweden. Whoossh is an innovative and effective 
method enabling the fast sorting and transporting of fish over the dam. 
River continuum restoration projects 
Fortum has continued its programme of dismantling small dams in Sweden � 
There are a total of 80 dams in the programme which are no longer 
significant for water regulation and energy production. In conjunction with 
the dam removal work, the river continuum is restored and stream water

habitats can be re-established. The projects are implemented in close 
collaboration with local actors and residents � 
In autumn 2019, we carried out the planned dismantling of four small 
dams on the River Klamma. In conjunction with the dismantling of the 
dams, the riverbed was reshaped and restored by bringing in rocks 
and gravel. The purpose of the project is to improve trout migration 
opportunities in the river and to restore the European crayfish habitats. 
Additionally, in 2019 we submitted applications to Swedish Environmental 
Court to remove four dams � 
Restoring habitats 
In summer 2019, we restored five rapids areas on the River Miesjoki in 
Finland together with the fisheries related stakeholders in the area. The 
goal was to create suitable spawning areas for grayling and trout by adding 
gravel in and around rapids � Habitat restoration efforts will continue in 
2020 in order to improve the natural breeding of trout on the Myllypuro 
stream adjacent to River Miesjoki. 
In 2019, Fortum took part in projects restoring a total of 6.5 hectares 
of habitats, as the accompanying table shows.
Protection of red-listed species and combating invasive 
species
At Lake Oulujärvi in Finland, we are taking part in biodiversity enhancing 
measures in the Önkköri area in Käkilahti in a three-year-long project. 
The aim of the project is to reduce overly dense aquatic vegetation and 
to create wetland habitats for multiple red-listed species, such as moor 
frogs and Laucorrhinia dragonflies, as well as several bird species. In 
2019, dredging was carried out, excess aquatic vegetation was removed, 
and small ponds and channels were dug out for aquatic bird habitats � 
In 2019, we also started measures to improve the biodiversity in 
the vicinity of Fortum’s power plants on the River Klarälven in Sweden. 
In autumn, the removal of invasive species of lupine was started on 
the upper section of the river. The goal of the project, implemented in collaboration with the County Administrative Board, is to secure habitats 
for endangered bees. By removing the lupine with their roots, sandy 
areas are created to enable indigenous plants and pollinators and other 
insects to spread �

We promote equal treatment and opportunities in the recruiting, 
remuneration, development and career advancement of personnel, 
regardless of the employee’s ethnic background, religion, political views, 
gender, age, nationality, language, sexual orientation, marital status or 
disabilities �
In Finland, we annually draft company-specific gender equality plans in 
collaboration with personnel representatives. Using various statistics, the 
gender equality plans examine the realisation of equality between men 
and women. Additionally, the plan lays out measures to further promote equality � The separate equality promotion plan addresses various forms of 
equality and is drafted annually at the corporate level for units operating 
in Finland � Its purpose is to assess the realisation of equality at the 
workplace and to develop working conditions and ways of operating to be 
followed when selecting employees and when making decisions affecting 
to employees � 
In Sweden, Fortum was the main supporter of  Equality Week 2019. 
During the event, among other things, we organised lectures, discussions 
and workshops on equality-related themes for our personnel. Additionally, 
we take part in the Female Leader Engineer programme in Sweden; the programme aims to strengthen the role of women in the corporate 
world and especially in engineering-dominated sectors where men 
are in the clear majority. Through the programme, female engineering 
students compete for internships in industrial companies � Fortum is 
also a participant in the 4Equal by 30  campaign, which aims to get 
governments, energy companies and other energy sector organisations 
to endorse principles related to equal pay, equal opportunities and equal 
leadership by 2030 in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
The average age of our permanent employees was 42.7 (2018: 42.9) 
years. The share of employees over 50 years old was 28% (2018: 29%). 
Females accounted for 32% (2018: 32%) of our total personnel. Females 
accounted for 30% (2018: 30%) of the Group- and division-level

(2018: 50th). Equileap annually collects data on over 3,000 companies 
worldwide � Its assessment criteria are related to the gender balance 
in leadership and workforce, equal compensation, work/life balance, 
and policies promoting gender equality in, e.g., recruiting and career 
development �
Any form of harassment is forbidden and addressed immediately � In 
Finland, Sweden, and India, for example, there are separate guidelines 
in place for workplace harassment and discrimination � There were no 
harassment or discrimination incidents reported to Fortum’s reporting 
channels in 2019, but a former Fortum employee reported to the 
Regional State Administrative Agency about experienced bullying during 
the employment� Fortum has issued a report about 
the matter, and the review of it is ongoing.

Equal remuneration
Salary levels at Fortum are compliant with established industry practices 
in each country, local legislation and sector-specific labour market and 
other agreements �
Remuneration is based on job-grade levels, job performance and 
the individual’s competence development � We remunerate personnel 
for achievement of the strategic business targets and successful 
implementation of changes � The short-term incentive pay portion of the voluntary and is offered to all Fortum Group employees, except in 
countries where prohibited by local legislation or other similar reasons, 
such as Russia. The employee share savings program was of interest, and 
41% of the personnel signed up for the first savings period. 
The global human resources data system and the harmonised 
job-grade classification system enable the examination of pay equality 
for the base salary in all our operating countries. In the table, we have 
reported the most significant countries in terms of the number of 
personnel � There is no reporting for other operating countries due to the 
low numbers of employees �
Our reporting covers all personnel groups except individuals working in 
blue-collar positions, which account for 28% of Fortum’s total personnel. 
A male/female comparison of blue-collar positions is not reported 
because of the small group sizes �
The total number of personnel included in the comparison was 3,945, 
of which 1,489 (38%) were female. The base salaries of female employees 
in 2019 were, on average, 5% (2018: 4%) lower than the male base 
salaries. When examining the differences by employee group and by 
country, the differences ranged between -25% and +5%. The average 
number of years of service for female employees was 9 and for male 
employees 11. Among other things, the fact that women more commonly 
work in support functions rather than technical positions contributed to 
the salary differences in Russia, as did regional differences in wages.annual salary is determined based on the individual’s job. The amount 
of incentive pay to be paid is based on the individual’s salary and on the 
achievement of the goals of the business unit and the individual � 
In 2019, Fortum’s Board of Directors decided on a new employee 
share savings programme. The first savings period begins in 2020. 
The purpose of the programme is to encourage employees to become 
Fortum shareholders and to strengthen their commitment to increasing 
shareholder value � Participation in the share savings programme is Basic salary of women compared to men (GRI 405-2)

Employee-employer relations
Fortum’s business operations are developed and strengthened in good 
collaboration with employees � We believe that the successful management 
of business is built on relationships of trust between management 
and employees and on the free flow of information. Fortum respects 
employees’ freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining �
In our operating countries, freedom of association and collective 
bargaining are guaranteed by law. The exception to this is India, which 
has not ratified the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Convention 
on the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. In India, 
we comply with the same practices as in other countries of operation, 
and we do not limit or prohibit the right to freedom of association �
We apply local collective bargaining agreements in compliance with 
the scope of each respective agreement in all our operating countries � 
Collective bargaining agreements cover nearly 85% of Fortum’s 
employees in our biggest operating countries and range from about 4% 
coverage in Latvia to over 90% in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia. 
There are no collective bargaining agreements in Lithuania, Poland 
and India. In these countries, employment contracts are based on local 
legislation and on the company’s human resources policy � 
Fortum European Council
Fortum European Council (FEC) is Fortum’s Europe-level cooperation 
function in which personnel and employer representatives meet� In 
2019, the FEC held a meeting in Finland, and personnel representatives 
from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Estonia and Denmark 
participated. The Council’s meeting focused on, among other topics, 
Fortum’s strategy and business outlook, capacity for change in the 
changing working environment, and occupational safety.
Additionally, the FEC personnel representatives convened their own 
annual meeting. In addition to Fortum European Council meetings, 
local level meetings are held several times a year in different countries 
as needed � Restructuring situations
In situations of organisational restructuring, we negotiate with personnel 
representatives in compliance with each country’s local legislation and 
contractual procedures. In situations involving personnel reductions, we 
want to primarily support the reemployment of the personnel �
In restructuring situations, the length of the obligatory negotiation 
period depends on the scale of upcoming changes and varies in 
Fortum’s different operating countries � The shortest period for obligatory 
negotiations is three weeks (Finland) and the longest is 90 days (India). 
There is no statutory obligatory negotiation period in Sweden, Norway 
and Lithuania �
The minimum notice period is based on local legislation, collective 
labour agreements or employment contracts, which are in harmony with 
the local legislation and agreements � In situations involving personnel 
reductions, we offer outplacement services on a per case and per 
country basis, and, in cooperation with local unemployment authorities 
or service providers, we investigate the possibilities to arrange vocational 
or other training that enhances employability � Retraining for employees 
who continue working is arranged based on organisational and individual 
needs. In situations involving personnel reductions, the content of the 
support package that we offer is decided based on local needs � The 
financial compensation of the package is usually based on the years of 
employment at Fortum �
Employee wellbeing
By improving work wellbeing, we support the work environment and 
a business culture that promotes our employees’ health, occupational 
safety and the functionality of the work community �
Energise Your Day wellbeing programme
The Energise Your Day wellbeing programme aims to support and 
encourage all Fortum employees to maintain and improve their overall 
wellbeing. The Energise Your Day programme was expanded to Hafslund-background companies in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Poland, and is 
now under way in all of Fortum’s operating countries � 
The Energise Your Day programme starts with a self-assessment-
based wellbeing survey, which nearly 5,000 Fortum employees 
responded to in 2019, resulting in a response rate of 66%. Based on the 
responses, the most sought after support and tools are for recovery, 
stress management and increasing the daily activity level � The strongest 
areas, based on the employees’ responses, were working capacity and 
nutrition � 
Based on the wellbeing survey results, employees are offered various 
wellbeing services, such as lectures, wellbeing coaching and measuring 
and other wellbeing activities. The focus areas in 2019 were overall 
wellbeing, recovery, sleep, and wellbeing in knowledge work. 
We also challenged the personnel to participate in the Carbon 
Footprint Challenge campaign, which supports Fortum’s vision for a 
cleaner world � The purpose of the campaign is to develop one’s own 
wellbeing by collecting eco-friendly kilometres, e.g., by walking or 
bicycling. In 2019, Fortum employees racked up 485,000 eco-friendly 
kilometres � 
A total 3,600 Fortum employees responded to the Wellbeing Pulse 
Survey conducted in 2019. Based on the feedback, work wellbeing is 
at a good level � The results were good especially regarding teamwork � 
According to the personnel, wellbeing can be further improved by, e.g., 
focusing more on training issues �
We promote wellbeing at the workplace also through what is called 
an early-support model � We increase open communication between 
employees and supervisors by discussing and mapping the reasons for 
absences � Training is arranged for supervisors in the management of 
working capacity and work wellbeing �

Occupational safety and health care
Occupational safety and health care are organised in our operating 
countries in line with local legislative requirements � The occupational 
safety committees represent all personnel groups, and they regularly 
address issues related to occupational safety and workplace wellbeing � 
A workplace study is the foundation of occupational health 
collaboration. It is used to identify the work, the working environment 
and the working community’s resources and possible factors 
endangering and burdening employee health and safety � A workplace 
study provides researched information about the workplace’s working 
conditions, making it possible to target measures in a sensible manner 
to improve occupational health activities and working conditions � The 
conclusions and recommended actions of a workplace study are taken 
into consideration in the occupational health care’s operating plan � 
A workplace study is a statutory obligation for employers in Finland and 
a prerequisite for the reimbursements of occupational health expenses 
from Kela (The Social Insurance Institution of Finland). 
All our employees are within the sphere of occupational health care � 
We emphasise the significance of preventive activities in promoting 
wellbeing in the company � The occupational health care costs per 
person in Finland, before the share reimbursed by Kela, were EUR 467 
(2018: 485).
Fortum conducts regular medical examinations of its personnel in 
accordance with local laws. Employees who in their work are exposed 
to, e.g., noise, dust, radiation or who perform shift work are within the 
sphere of the examinations. Occupational health care also participates 
in various discussions and assessments in the work community � The 
occupational health care professionals support supervisors by providing 
information, methods and tools related to preventive actions as well as 
alternatives when the ability to work decreases. In 2019, there was a 
special emphasis in Finland on ergonomics and on carrying out targeted 
workplace studies �In 2019, the percentage of sickness-related absences was 2.9 
(2018: 2.8), which was higher than the target level of ≤2.5. Sickness 
absences increased especially in Russia and Norway. For males, the 
percentage of sickness-related absences was 2.4 (2018: 2.3) and for 
females 4.3 (2018: 4.0). The sickness absence rate is calculated based on 
the theoretical working hours of the permanent employees � In addition 
to expansion of the Energise Your Day wellbeing programme, the 
management of sickness-related absences was one of our focus areas 
in 2019. 
There was one (2018: 5) case of suspected occupational disease in 
Finland � The case was related to noise and involved a male employee � 
The case was not determined to be an occupational disease. In addition, 
three cases of suspected occupational disease raised prior 2019 were 
determined to be non-occupational �
An indication of the good management level of working capacity and 
workplace wellbeing at Fortum is the average retirement age, which was 
62 (2018: 62) years. In 2019, the average effective retirement age in 
the earnings-related pension scheme in Finland was 61.5 years (Source: 
Finnish Centre for Pensions).

Employee development
Our goal is to be a forerunner in the future energy system. This means 
that we must continuously invest in the development of leadership 
and personnel competence and in the support of an open and flexible 
corporate culture �
In 2019, we performed so called 360 assessments based on our open 
leadership principles to more than 400 supervisors, and we arranged 
several events focusing on open leadership-related themes. Our Russia 
Division published a Russian-language handbook about open leadership � 
We re-launched the Navigator programme targeting future talent, 
and 38 Fortum employees started in the programme. The programme 
consists of five modules that were arranged in Fortum’s different 
operating countries � The training programme focused especially on 
developing leadership skills and expanding business understanding. 
We offered our personnel a variety of new online training modules, 
and we held Fortum Talks events to share information about current 
topics related to Fortum’s business. Additionally, we created the Fortum 
Lens data platform that aims to improve the personnel access to real-
time data and figures related to business.
Job rotation is seen at Fortum as an important way to develop 
personnel expertise and to support open leadership principles. Job 
rotation reached a record-high rate in 2019, and 20% of the personnel 
either transferred permanently to a new position or took part in a project 
that was unrelated to their own job.
The total number of all training hours in 2019 was 50,749 
(2018: 64,831). Training costs in 2019 totalled EUR 4.5 (2018: 4.0) 
million �Performance and development discussions
We support employee development through the annual performance 
and development discussions; all employees are within the scope 
of the annual discussions. The main target of the performance and 
development discussion is to ensure that the employee has clear targets 
that align with the business as well as the competencies supporting the 
achievement of the targets and professional growth � 
The achievement of the targets forms the basis for payment of 
incentives � All permanent employees who have a minimum of three 
months of employment in Fortum are within the scope of Fortum’s 
incentive scheme �
Faster feedback from personnel
The most important elements of Fortum’s leadership principles include 
giving and getting feedback. That is why we use a real-time and flexible 
pulse tool to find out employee opinions; the tool allows supervisors 
and employees to see the results as soon as the feedback is given � The 
opportunity to constantly track the development of issues supports a 
coaching management approach � Every six months, we measure personnel engagement and satisfaction 
with ten questions � The response rate of the survey carried out in 
November 2019 was 62% (2018: 57%). According to the results,  68% 
(2018: 66%) of the personnel feel a commitment to the company and 
83% (2018: 83%) is proud to work at Fortum. Based on the survey, the 
principles of open leadership have gained a stronger foothold within the 
company, and 78% (2018: 73%) of the personnel saw progress in this 
area �  
Compared to the results of the previous year, the biggest improvement 
was seen in the increase in collaboration between the divisions and 
units and in the open, two-way communications. Based on the results of 
previous surveys, collaboration between divisions and units in particular 
had been identified as a target of development; measures to promote it 
will continue � Nearly half of the personnel still feel that decision-making 
in their own unit is too hierarchical, and the results in this area did not 
change from the previous year � We aim to have more focus on developing 
this area in open leadership � Training hours in 2019

Safety and security 
For Fortum, excellence in safety is the foundation 
of our business, and safe performance is a sign of 
professionalism. We strive to be a safe workplace for 
our employees and for the contractors and service 
providers who work for us. 
Occupational and operational safety 
We believe that all work injuries and EHS non-compliances are preventable 
when competence and the right attitude prevails, when potential risks are 
addressed and when measures are taken to safeguard against them �
Occupational health and safety management 
Safety is developed systematically in all our operations � Fortum has 
Group-level EHS instructions and minimum requirements that set 
requirements for all the operations for which we have operative 
responsibility. We regularly update the requirements, and we assess the 
divisions’ performance in complying with the revised requirements � Safety 
development plans are made as part of the annual business planning and 
they are based on the principle of continuous improvement� We actively 
conduct external and internal audits to improve operations.
For 2019, we set Group-level targets for the following key figures:
• Lost workday injury frequency (LWIF), own personnel and contractors 
• Number of severe occupational accidents 
• Quality of investigation process of injuries, major EHS incidents and 
near misses
• GAP index, implementation of EHS minimum requirements
• Contractor safety improvement index
The safety targets apply to all Fortum employees and are part of the 
Group’s4short-term incentive programme � Calculated in terms of sales, 96.5% (2018: 97 .0%) of Fortum’s 
electricity and heat production operations at the end of 2019 were 
OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001 certified. The decrease in coverage was due 
to Fortum Oslo Varme, whose operations are not yet certified.
Safety performance 
In 2019, we achieved significant improvements in the safety performance 
of contractors. We put special focus on assessing contractor safety, and 
the contractors’ lost workday injury frequency (LWIF) decreased to 3.3 
(2018: 4.8).
The lost workday injury frequency (LWIF) for own personnel and 
contractors was 1.7 (2018: 1.8), and the set target level (≤1.7) was 
achieved. The injury frequency of our own personnel increased slightly, 
but the achieved level of 0.8 (2018: 0.2) can still be considered good.
The Group target in 2019 was zero severe occupational accidents. 
Unfortunately, one case of occupational violence took place in Russia, and 
it was classified as a severe occupational accident. 
We achieved the set target levels for all the three leading indicators � 
The quality of investigation process for occupational accidents, major 
EHS incidents, and serious near misses was at level 3.0. The GAP index, 
describing the implementation of the EHS minimum requirements, was 
also 3.0. The most significant deviations were detected in companies 
that Fortum has acquired in recent years and at new sites that are just 
starting to implement Fortum’s ways of operating � The most common 
deviations were related to work permits, high risk work, and contractor 
management processes � 
The contractor safety improvement index, in use since the second 
quarter of 2019, measures how well Fortum has managed to implement 
measures targeting improvements in contractor safety � The contractor 
safety index was at level 2.0. However, the assessment has not covered 
all Fortum operations � Occupational safety risk assessment and incident 
investigation
Occupational risk management includes all levels, from strategic risks 
and business planning to daily work � A risk management plan is drafted 
on the basis of a risk assessment� Assessments and plans are made 
together with those working at the worksites and they are updated at 
agreed intervals and when conditions change �
At Fortum, work in closed and particularly confined spaces, working 
at heights, and heavy lifting work, as well as the handling of hazardous 
chemicals have been classified as high-risk work. Requirements related 
to, e.g., personnel training and experience, the provision of instructions, 
and the pre-job verification to be performed have been defined for 
performing high-risk work �
Fortum’s senior management is responsible for occupational safety risk 
management principles, targets, and development and maintenance of 
the risk management process, as well as for evaluating the effectiveness 
of risk management� Local management is responsible for the practical 
risk assessment and management work � 
The risk management process is developed based on continuous 
improvement principles and takes into consideration incidents and 
deviations at Fortum and other companies � During incident investigations 
it is concluded whether the risk assessments have been correct and the 
preventive actions sufficient. 
Fortum line management is responsible for incident investigations 
as well as for providing the required resources and taking care of 
the communication. When relevant, Fortum’s crisis management and 
crisis communication procedures are followed � Every organisation has 
a group of trained incident investigators who are actively involved in 
investigations � 
The findings of investigations are documented in Fortum’s incident-
handling system FRIDA � The learnings are shared with the organisations 
through digital safety bulletins � The quality of conducted investigations is 
verified by the divisions with quarterly process maturity assessments.

Training and development projects related to   
occupational safety 
To further improve the occupational safety level, we implemented a 
training programme aimed at top management� The programme was 
conducted by one of the world’s leading consultant companies in the field 
of safety. In the programme, special focus was put on top management’s 
role in improving the occupational safety culture, and it included coaching 
and practical training related to the necessary personal leadership skills � 
It also focused on the systems and structures that support the safety 
culture transformation �
We continued the assessment of contractor safety performance as 
part of the supplier qualification process and evaluated safety practices 
in a more systematic manner also during work � We use the contractor 
safety index to measure progress in applying the instructions and in 
implementing the mutually agreed practices �
To communicate information about the various ways, guidelines and 
tools to improve safety, we updated and published new safety materials 
in ten languages: we released two online training courses and a safety 
video, and we updated our Safety and Security Handbook.
Occupational hygiene
In recent years, Fortum has expanded its business in the recycling and 
waste management sectors. This change has subjected our operating 
environment to new kinds of exposure agents, like chemicals that are 
processed in hazardous waste treatment plants, and microbes related to 
handling of mixed waste, which may cause adverse effects for employees. 
For us to work safely, we must be aware of the risks related to 
exposure agents and follow the best practices in order not to cause 
harm to health, safety or environment. In 2019, we strengthened our 
know-how in this area by recruiting an occupational hygienist, whose 
job it is to support our operations in identifying and managing operating 
environment-related exposure agents, as well as to develop uniform 
procedures and ensure their implementation �The work in 2019 focused particularly on supporting Fortum Recycling 
and Waste Solutions. Additionally, we wanted to develop chemical safety 
by launching an online training � The training is designed especially for 
those who handle chemicals in their work, but also for other Fortum 
employees as a refresher on the safe handling of chemicals �
Operational safety 
We track major environmental, health and safety (EHS) incidents as a 
Group target; these incidents cover major fires, leaks >100 litres into 
the environment, explosions, nuclear and dam safety incidents, and 
environmental non-compliances. There were 11 (2018: 18) EHS incidents 
in 2019; the target was ≤18. The major EHS incidents included three 
(2018: 11) fires, two (2018: 2) environmental non-compliances, 
four (2018: 4) leaks, one (2018: 0) explosion, and one (2018: 0) 
INES (International Nuclear Event Scale) level 1 incident. There were no 
other major EHS incidents (2018: 1). The incidents did not cause significant 
harm to people, Fortum’s operations or the environment. 
Dam safety
In 2019, Fortum continued the high-quality work to ensure dam 
safety and to develop dam safety processes and practices � The main 
development measures focused on dam performance monitoring, on river 
plans with the aim to improve preparedness for emergency situations, 
on preparations to select a new operation and maintenance partner in 
Sweden, and on investment analyses. Fortum has actively participated in 
the updating of Sweden’s dam safety guidelines (RIDAS).
In 2019, the preparation and implementation of dam safety 
investments proceeded as planned. Three dam safety projects, 
Långströmmen and Ljusneströmmar in Sweden and the Imatra project in 
Finland, were completed. Our new, extensive dam safety project at the 
Trängslet dam in the 4Dalälven water system in Sweden was approved 
in autumn 2019, and the work at the dam has started. In terms of output 
capacity, Trängslet is our biggest hydropower plant, and the Trängslet dam is the highest dam in Sweden. For 2020, we are planning two new 
large-scale dam safety projects for the Forshuvud dam in Sweden and 
the Tainionkoski dam in Finland �
The most significant of our dam safety projects in the preliminary 
planning phase are the Letten and Dejefors dams in the 4Klarälven 
water system , and the Lanforsen and Untra dams in the Dalälven water 
systems in Sweden � The construction work on these will commence in 
2021 or 2022. The most important goals of the projects are to bring 
the dams up to current dam safety standards by increasing discharge 
capacity and by refurbishing structures, and to extend the useful life of 
the dams. Fortum had no significant operative challenges related to dam 
safety in 2019.
Nuclear safety
Loviisa power plant’s flood control project was completed in 2019. The 
modifications reduced the flood risk caused by an estimated sea-level 
rise exceeding three meters. The modernisation of the Polar cranes in the 
reactor buildings was also completed. This significantly reduced the drop 
risks of heavy lifts and loads � 
A modification of the primary water purification system’s filtering was 
also implemented in both Loviisa power plant’s units; consequently, a 
further significant decrease is expected in radiation doses during annual 
outages. Additionally, to ensure sufficient data transmission capacity 
and availability, a fibre optic connection was installed through the 
containment building �
The transmitters for the emergency make-up water tank surface-
level measurements in the Loviisa power plant’s unit 1 were replaced 
with transmitters from two different suppliers � The change reduced the 
possibility of a combined failure in measuring, which in turn significantly 
reduced the risk of damage to the power plant’s reactor core �

 Safety and security
Corporate security 
Through corporate security, we strive to ensure the uninterrupted 
continuity of business and the safety of people, information, our assets 
and processes in normal and exceptional situations. Uninterrupted energy 
production and distribution is important – both for Fortum’s business 
operations and for an energy-dependent society �
Our Corporate Security unit is responsible at the Group level for 
cyber, personnel and operational security. The business divisions play 
an important role in implementing security � The Business Technology 
function offers cyber security services for the company �
Securing personnel and business 
Compliance with the minimum security requirements improves our 
operational ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and thus 
improves productivity. We assess risks related to people, business and 
information in all operating countries and in countries where we have 
potential operations or business travel � Risks impacting the company 
and business operations may be directly or indirectly related to political 
situations, terrorism, crime, conflicts and business partners. Corporate 
security is improved also by gaining a deeper understanding of the security 
situation, which is provided to support business decision making. 
Cyber security
We have a cyber security programme to ensure the security of the 
information we handle and the security of our IT systems � The cyber 
security programme focuses on data, digital and IT services security, 
and security of automation systems � The aim is to ensure the production 
and distribution of power and heat and the functioning of digital services 
offered to customers � We also aim to secure partner-related risks to the 
extent that they relate to the company’s processes. 
In information security, we aim to ensure the accessibility, integrity and 
confidentiality of critical information. We also take seriously our compliance 
with the regulations related to the protection of personal data � Customer 
data protection is discussed in the 4Product responsibility  section �We actively engage in collaboration with authorities and other 
stakeholders to identify and prevent increasing and changing cyber 
threats � We improve the information security awareness of our employees 
through training and instructions �
Contingency planning 
Political uncertainty and climate change, as well as the growing dependence 
on partners may cause disruptions to the company’s operations � For this 
reason, we have invested in preparing for disaster and emergency situations. 
Fortum’s crisis and emergency management instructions are prepared 
for Group, division and site levels. We updated the crisis management 
plans to correspond with the changes implemented in the business 
functions and organisations � The testing and updating of the crisis 
management and continuity plans are the responsibility of each division 
and line organisation � Crises impacting Group operations more broadly 
are managed at the Group level � 
Crisis management and crisis communication instructions have been 
prepared for, e.g., power and heat outages, for the Loviisa nuclear power 
plant and for hydro power production � Corporate Security is responsible 
for crisis management development, e.g., for organising rehearsals. Group 
Communications is responsible for crisis communications � 
In 2019, the annual emergency preparedness exercise related to a 
nuclear power accident was held at the Loviisa power plant. Additionally, 
several business-specific exercises were held during the year.
Regulatory compliance 
In recent years, safety and security related regulations have increased, 
and we have initiated supplementary measures required by these 
regulations. For dam and nuclear safety, emergency preparedness 
obligations in Finland and Sweden are based on regulatory provisions; 
likewise, there are terrorism-related preparedness obligations in Russia. 
Regarding other areas, Fortum independently defines, based on its own 
risk assessments, the crisis and non-compliance situations for which it 
prepares and drafts action plans �

Our way of operating responsibly includes a close 
dialogue with our stakeholders and continuously 
identifying their views. Good collaboration and 
openness are the key ways to promote a mutual 
understanding with our stakeholders. We distribute 
added value to our various stakeholders through the 
payment of taxes, employee wages and dividends, and 
through investments and procurements from suppliers 
of goods and services.
Stakeholder collaboration 
Collaboration with different stakeholder groups helps Fortum to assess 
and meet the expectations that stakeholder groups have towards 
the company � We engage in an active dialogue with the different 
stakeholders associated with our operations � We conduct annual 
stakeholder surveys � We monitor and assess the public dialogue in 
the countries where we operate, and we have increased the dialogue 
with our stakeholders also through social media channels � Feedback 
from customers drives the development of our products and services � 
Additionally, our activities in national and international organisations help 
to deepen our understanding of global sustainability issues and their 
connections to our business �
Management of stakeholder collaboration at Fortum is assigned 
particularly to communications, public affairs, group sustainability, 
the functions responsible for electricity and heat sales and energy 
production, as well as many of our experts. Responsibilities for managing 
stakeholder collaboration are primarily determined by stakeholder group 
or interaction themes. Key interaction areas, e.g., public affairs, and 
corporate communications, have annual plans that guide the activities. Fortum has an informal Advisory Council consisting of representatives 
of Fortum’s key stakeholder groups as invited by the Board of Directors � 
The Advisory Council aims to increase the dialogue and the exchange of 
views between the company and its stakeholders �
Information through surveys 
In collaboration with third parties, we annually conduct surveys regarding 
stakeholder collaboration � The aim of these surveys is to help Fortum 
assess and respond to the important stakeholder groups’ expectations of 
the company � The surveys also measure the success of our stakeholder 
collaboration. Additionally, the surveys provide information about 
emerging sustainability trends and risks we should acknowledge � We 
use the survey results in business planning and development and in 
identifying priorities for sustainability �We use the extensive One Fortum Survey to annually measure 
customer satisfaction and our reputation and the factors that impact 
them � The survey is conducted yearly in spring in all of Fortum’s 
business functions � The survey results in terms of customer satisfaction 
are presented in the section 4Customers . As part of the One Fortum 
Survey, we also regularly survey what our stakeholders consider to be 
our4sustainability priorities �

 Stakeholders 
Uniper’s coal power a target of campaigns by 
environmental organisations 
The dialogue about Fortum’s Uniper investment and Uniper’s coal power 
continued actively with environmental non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) in 2019 and in early 2020. The NGOs are particularly opposed to 
Uniper’s plan to commission the new Datteln 4 coal-fired power plant in 
Germany � The organisations have elevated the plant as a symbol for their 
campaigning against climate change and have demanded that Fortum 
stop Uniper from connecting the plant to the grid � 
The environmental organisations have tried to bring attention to their 
agenda through social media, demonstrations and by organising various 
public events and webinars � Fortum has responded to the concerns 
raised by these organisations in social media, at meetings and at the 
General Annual Meeting. Fortum’s experts have also responded to 
presented questions, through blogs postings and by giving numerous 
media interviews �
In its own communications, Fortum has called for perspective and 
comprehensive solutions instead of symbols � We have pointed out that 
Germany is shutting down half of its electricity production with the 
phase out of nuclear power and of hard coal- and lignite-fired plants. The 
transition to clean energy must be implemented systematically, without 
compromising the security of supply and with consideration to regional 
aspects � Energy affordability for electricity consumers and industry must 
also be a factor �
For years, Fortum has been one of the biggest supporters of EU 
emissions trading and has tried to get decision makers to focus also on 
decarbonisation of the heat and transport sectors. In fact, emissions 
trading has already proven its effectiveness – while the price of emission 
allowances increased considerably in 2019, Europe’s CO 2 emissions 
decreased by more than 20%, or 80 million carbon dioxide tonnes. National decisions set the pace of coal power phase-out  
in Europe
Energy companies play a key role in Europe’s transition towards 
emissions-free energy production and carbon neutrality � In all the 
northern and western European countries where Fortum and Uniper 
have coal power, there are also national decisions to discontinue the use 
of coal. Great Britain is giving up coal power in 2024, Finland in 2029, 
and The Netherlands in 2030. The premise of the German government’s 
draft law is that coal use will be discontinued by 2038 at the latest. Of 
Fortum’s operating counties, the most dependent on fossil energy are 
Poland and Russia � These countries have not yet set a time frame for 
discontinuing coal power � 
Uniper and Fortum’s voluntary decisions to phase out  
coal power
Uniper’s share of Germany’s coal capacity is less than 9%, and the 
company has announced that it will decommission most of it� In late 
January 2020, Uniper announced that it will decommission four coal-
fired units already within two years and two more units within five years 
presuming that Germany’s coal legislation comes into effect� The total 
output of the plants to be decommissioned by 2022 at the latest is 
1.5 GW, and the total output of those to be decommissioned by 2025 
at the latest is 1.4 GW. Uniper has stated that the company’s emissions 
from coal-fired power production in Germany will decrease by 40% by 
2025 when the old plants are decommissioned and Datteln 4 has started 
its operations. In addition, the company has announced the divestment 
of its share in the lignite-fired Schkopau power plant to the plant’s 
co-owner. The sale will be completed in 2021. 
Fortum, in turn, will discontinue the use of coal in Espoo in an 
accelerated time frame already in 2025. The Kivenlahti bioheat plant to be commissioned in 2020 will replace one of the two Suomenoja coal 
units. To replace the remaining coal production, Fortum is pursuing new 
solutions utilising the excess heat from data centres, wastewater and 
industry, electric heat pumps, geothermal, smart demand-response 
solutions and bioenergy. Additionally, Fortum and the City of Espoo 
have committed to carbon-neutral district heat production in the district 
heating network operating in the Espoo, Kauniainen and Kirkkonummi 
regions in the 2020s.
Fortum’s other joint ventures and associated companies are also 
discontinuing coal use. Stockholm Exergi will decommission its last coal 
boiler in 2020, and Turun Seudun Energiantuotanto announced that it will 
decommission the old coal boiler unit 2 this year.
Reputation 
According to the One Fortum Survey, our reputation remained very stable 
during 2019. The reputation index change compared to 2018 was one 
point, at maximum, within all stakeholder groups except decision makers. 
Among decision makers, the reputation index decreased by three points 
in 2019, resulting in a rating of 78 (on a scale of 0–100). 
In general, our reputation remained on a very good level (≥75 points) 
among decision makers, opinion leaders, organisations, investors and 
personnel. Among media, the reputation index was on a rather good 
level (68). Among the general public, the result was clearly lower (58) 
compared to other stakeholder groups �
Our most significant strengths in terms of reputation are our 
operational expertise and reliability as an employer. We have most room 
for improvement in social responsibility. To improve social responsibility, 
we drafted a new sustainability programme for the company in 2019. Its 
implementation will begin in 2020.
The Group-level target for our reputation in 2019 was a rating of 
73.0 in the One Fortum Survey, measured as the average rating by all 
stakeholders included in the survey. We achieved a rating of 72.3. Our 
target for 2020 (72.5) includes the same stakeholder groups as in 2019.Brand
We continuously monitor the development of the Fortum brand, i.e. the 
image of our company. Brand tracking includes the measurement of, e.g., 
brand awareness, preference and brand attributes.
We also monitor the development of the Fortum brand with the Brand 
Value study performed by Brand Finance, an independent business 
valuation consultancy. According to the study, Fortum’s brand value in 
2019 was EUR 796 million, compared to EUR 684 million in 2018.

Economic impacts
Fortum is a significant economic actor in Finland, Sweden, Russia, Poland, 
Norway and the Baltic countries � We continuously monitor the impact 
and added value generated by our operations to our stakeholders � The 
key stakeholders include lenders and shareholders, customers, personnel, 
suppliers of goods and services, and the public sector.
Direct and indirect impacts
The most significant direct monetary flows of Fortum’s operations come 
from revenue from customers, procurements of goods and services from 
suppliers, compensation to lenders, dividends to shareholders, growth 
and maintenance investments, employee wages and salaries, and taxes 
paid. Our operations also have indirect economic impacts. The Finnish 
State owns 50.8% of Fortum’s shares, and we contribute to a functioning 
society by, among other things, paying taxes and dividends. These 
secure society’s basic functions and build wellbeing � Investments and 
the procurement of goods and services provide employment both locally 
and outside our operating areas � New investment proposals are assessed 
against sustainability criteria. In terms of suppliers of goods and services, 
we also assess the global impacts, paying particular attention to suppliers 
of goods and services operating in risk countries. The wages and taxes 
paid have a positive impact on local communities �

 Stakeholders 
Customers
As a responsible actor in the electricity, heat and 
circular economy business, Fortum offers consumers 
environmentally friendly and cost-efficient products 
and services. It also ensures the reliability of its 
marketing and communications. Fortum mirrors 
its operational responsibility through customer 
satisfaction amongst customers.
Product responsibility 
Fortum is the third largest power generator and the largest electricity 
retailer in the Nordic countries � We are one of the world’s largest 
producers of heat. We also offer district cooling, energy efficiency
services, recycling and waste solutions, and the largest electric vehicle
charging network in the Nordic countries � 
CO2-free and guarantee-of-origin-labelled electricity 
Hydro and nuclear account for two-thirds of our electricity production, 
making us one of the Nordic countries’ leading sellers of carbon dioxide-
free and guarantee-of-origin-labelled electricity. We sell CO 2-free 
electricity to our customers in the Nordic countries � The origin of the 
electricity produced from renewable energy sources, such as hydro, 
wind and solar, was guaranteed with European guarantees of origin. 
Some of the electricity we sell is also guaranteed with the pan-European 
EKOenergy label granted by environmental organisations and, in Sweden, 
with the Bra Miljöval label. 
Services for customers 
In recent years, Fortum has introduced many new services that reduce 
environmental impacts and give customers better opportunities to 
control their electricity consumption and costs � The sustainable solutions 
we offer in energy production, traffic and waste management also support a circular economy � The number of consumers participating 
in energy production is growing � The solutions offered by Fortum are 
related to home automation, smart EV charging, local energy production 
and storage, and flexible demand. Additionally, we offer diverse expertise 
services for energy systems, electricity and heat production, and for 
the process industry. Our waste and circular economy service covers, 
e.g., the safe treatment of hazardous waste, the recycling, processing 
and manufacturing of plastic and metal into secondary raw materials for 
industry, and environmental construction services by utilising industry’s 
side streams � 
Marketing communications
Our goal is to present products and services truthfully in all our 
marketing and communication materials � We follow responsible marketing 
communication guidelines, and we do not present misleading statements. 
In statements regarding environmental issues, we follow the regulations 
for environmental marketing �
In 2019, Fortum received from the Finnish Energy Authority a 
decision regarding the pricing of certain electricity products � Fortum 
has implemented the decision and has, in order to seek further certainty 
on the interpretation of the decision, appealed to the Market Court. In 
addition, Fortum received from the Finnish Energy Authority and from 
the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority certain requests for 
clarification regarding consumer products. We have addressed these 
requests for clarification within the deadline.
In Sweden, the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Ethics Committee 
for Direct Marketing instructed Fortum to implement certain changes to 
our marketing communications and processes � We are cooperating with 
the authorities and are in the process of implementing the requested 
changes. Fortum has been identified by the Swedish Consumer Energy 
Markets Bureau as one of the electricity companies with a relatively large 
number of customer complaints � We have launched an improvement programme that has so far decreased the number of complaints by more 
than 75%.
In Norway, Fortum received a decision from the Norwegian Consumer 
Authority regarding sales practices � Fortum appealed the decision and 
it was subsequently annulled by the Market Council. In addition, Fortum 
received from the Norwegian Consumer Authority certain inquiries and

Customer satisfaction
For Fortum, customer satisfaction is a top priority in implementing the 
company’s strategy and in growing the business � We have set a Group-
wide target for customer satisfaction (≥70).
We measure customer satisfaction as part of the extensive One 
Fortum Survey � The survey is conducted yearly in spring in all Fortum’s 
business functions � The Consumer Solutions division also measures 
satisfaction in autumn. In 2019, about 8,300 customers from seven 
different business functions took part in the yearly survey �
As a whole, for a large share of Fortum’s business functions the 
customer satisfaction is at a good level (customer satisfaction index ≥70 
on a scale of 0–100) or at a very good level (≥75).
Of all Fortum’s customer groups, the most satisfied customers are in 
the Nuclear Services and the Recycling and Waste Solutions units � The 
customer satisfaction rating of both business units was on the rise in 
2019, and both received an excellent (80) rating. Satisfaction amongst 
our district heating customers remained virtually unchanged (business 
customers 74 and consumer customers 70). The customer satisfaction of 
Fortum eNext, which provides power plant services, decreased slightly, 
but was still at a good level (74).
Satisfaction amongst electricity retail customers decreased for virtually 
all brands, and overall the rating was clearly lower than the previous 
year’s level (consumers 66 and business customers 60). Customer 
satisfaction with Fortum Charge & Drive, offering charging solutions for 
electric vehicles, increased slightly among consumers, but decreased 
among business customers. However, the rating for both in 2019 was 
clearly below expectations (consumers 59 and business customers 54).
The customer satisfaction target set for 2020 is the same for all 
business areas, i.e. a rating of “good” (≥70), measured with the One 
Fortum Survey � Other public customer satisfaction results
The international and independent EPSI Rating annually surveys the level 
of satisfaction of electricity retail company customers in Finland, Sweden 
and Norway�

Field biomass is largely an unutilised resource that is either left on the 
ground or, in some countries, burned at its growing site. At the core of 
Fortum’s Bio2X research and development programme is the utilisation 
of wheat straw to create high-value bioproducts, in addition to grains 
for food. One of the many areas of application is ecologically produced 
textile fibres. In collaboration with Spinnova, a Finnish supplier of new 
fibre technology, Bio2X has developed the first textile fibre made from 
fractionated wheat straw. The companies were first in the world to 
showcase fabric samples and a sample knitted shirt made from the fibre 
as well as a jacket and skirt made of a woven fabric at the Textile Exchange 
Sustainability Conference in Vancouver, Canada, in October 2019. 
Sustainable textile
In terms of life-cycle analyses, fractionated straw pulp and the textile 
fibres derived from it are very comparable to commercially available 
fibres that are least environmentally burdensome, like organic cotton and 
lyocell. Very little water is used in the process, the chemicals used are 
non-toxic, and the energy is generally produced with renewable energy 
production forms, so the CO 2 emissions of the process are minor � With 
high resource efficiency fractionation, only about 5% of the original field 
biowaste goes unused � This share can be utilised in the energy production 
for the process �Case | From wheat straw to clothing

 Supply chain
Supply chain
Fortum is a significant purchaser of goods and services. 
Suppliers are an important part of a successful 
business, and through responsible supplier selections 
we also support the achievement of sustainability 
targets.
Electricity purchases and investments play  
a significant role 
Fortum’s total purchasing volume in 2019 was EUR 3.8 (2018: 3.7) billion. 
Electricity purchased from the Nordic wholesale electricity market for 
retail sales, investments, and fuel purchases accounted for the majority of 
Fortum’s purchases � 
Of our purchases, EUR 695 (2018: 579) million targeted various 
investments. The biggest investments, EUR 188 million, were made 
in Finland. A large share of the investments is contracted out in full, 
with materials, installation and other service as well as contractor work 
included in the total purchase � 
Fortum’s fuel purchases in 2019 totalled EUR 591 (2018: 561) million. 
We purchase fuels from international and local suppliers. Our fossil fuel 
purchases totalled about EUR 488 (2018: 496) million, biomass fuels 
about EUR 72 (2018: 61) million, and nuclear fuel about EUR 30 (2018: 
32) million. 
The rest of our purchases, EUR 2.5 (2018: 2.6) billion, consist of other 
goods and services. The figure includes electricity purchased from the 
Nordic wholesale electricity market for retail sales � The other goods 
and services purchases were related to, for example, operation and 
maintenance as well as to other functions, such as IT solutions, marketing 
and travel � Over half of purchases from Europe
Over half, i.e. about 60%, of the purchasing volume was purchased from 
suppliers operating in Europe, mostly in Finland, Sweden and Norway. 
This does not include electricity purchases from the Nordic wholesale 
market. About 40% (2018: 39%) of Fortum’s purchases were from risk 
countries. The majority of these purchases were from Russia.
Violations related to work conditions and human rights are more 
likely in risk countries than in non-risk countries � Fortum’s risk-country 
classification is based on the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda, the UN 
Human Development Index and Transparency International’s Corruption 
Perceptions Index.
In 2019, we had about 14,000 (2018: 14,000) suppliers of goods and 
services. About 1,170 of the suppliers were in risk countries. Excluding 
the Russia Division’s local suppliers, there were about 105 suppliers in 
risk countries � 
Sustainable fuel purchasing
The most significant environmental impacts of our supply chain are 
related mainly to fuels, particularly to coal and biomasses. There are 
significant environmental aspects associated with coal mining, including 
natural resource efficiency, emissions to air, water and soil, and impacts 
on biodiversity. Significant occupational health and safety risks can be 
related to working in underground mines � The sustainability aspects 
of biomass sourcing are related primarily to biodiversity, but risks 
particularly outside the EU can also include, for instance, illegal logging or 
human rights violations �
In fuel purchasing, special attention is paid to the origin of the fuel and 
to responsible production. In 2019, we had about 170 suppliers in our 
fuel supply chain, 6% of them operated in risk countries.Purchases 1) by operating countries, 2017–2019

Natural gas
The natural gas used in Russia, the Baltic countries and Finland originated 
from several different suppliers in Russia � The natural gas used in Poland 
originated mainly from Poland and the natural gas used in Norway 
originated from Norway �
Coal
The coal used in Finland originated from Russia � The coal used in 
Poland originated from Poland � The power plants in Russia used coal 
originating from Kazakhstan and Russia. Fortum has published the names 
of its significant coal suppliers on its 4website � Fortum is a member 
of the4Bettercoal  initiative, and uses the Bettercoal Code and tools 
in assessing the sustainability of the coal supply chain � There is more 
about Bettercoal assessments in the section 4Supplier audits support 
assessments � 
Biomass
The biomass we used originated from Finland, Russia, the Baltic countries 
and Poland. Slightly over 50% of the wood-based biofuel used by Fortum 
in 2019 originated from certified or controlled sources. In 2019, we 
developed elements of a Chain of Custody management system for 
wood-based fuel by strengthening the systematic assessment of risks 
related to supply chains and procurement countries �

Waste-derived fuel
We use waste-derived fuel at our power plants in Finland, Sweden, 
Norway, Denmark, Lithuania and Poland. The fuel used is mainly municipal 
and industrial waste collected locally �
Uranium
The fuel assemblies used at the Loviisa power plant in Finland are 
completely of Russian origin � The fuel supplier acquires the uranium used 
in the fuel assemblies from Russian mines in accordance with Fortum’s 
agreement. In 2019, the uranium originated from the Krasnokamensk, 
Khiagda and Dalur mines. All three uranium mines have ISO 14001 
environmental certification. The Khiagda mine has also an OHSAS 18001 
certified occupational health and safety management system. ARMZ 
Uranium Holding Co., a uranium producer, and TVEL, which is responsible 
for refining and manufacturing uranium, have certified environmental 
and occupational safety systems in place in all their plants, as do the 
plants manufacturing zirconium material, uranium oxide pellets and fuel 
assemblies �
We regularly assess the quality, environmental, and occupational 
health and safety management systems of our nuclear fuel suppliers 
and the manufacturing of nuclear fuel assemblies. In summer 2019, 
Fortum’s representatives assessed the operations of Fortum’s Russian 
fuel supplier’s conversion and enrichment plants � The plants were in good 
technical condition, and their integrated management system covered 
certified quality, environmental as well as occupational health and safety 
management systems. Additionally, the plants have in place a certified 
system for energy management �

Sustainable supply chain
We expect our business partners to act responsibly and to comply with 
the Fortum Code of Conduct and the Supplier Code of Conduct� Fortum’s 
key tools in supply chain management are supplier qualification and 
supplier audits �
Codes of conduct cover basic requirements
The Fortum Code of Conduct forms the foundation for ethical business 
conduct and defines how we treat others, engage in business, and 
safeguard our corporate assets � 
The Supplier Code of Conduct includes the sustainability requirements 
for suppliers of services and goods � The Supplier Code of Conduct is 
based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact initiative 
and is divided into four sections: anti-corruption, human rights, labour 
standards, and the environment. 
The Supplier Code of Conduct is used in all our countries of operation 
and is included in all purchase agreements with a contract value of 
EUR 50,000 or more.Supplier qualification
We assess the sustainability performance of our business partners 
through supplier qualification and supplier audits. A supplier qualification 
is made when the purchase volume is EUR 50,000 or more. In the 
qualification process, we determine and assess, among other things, the 
supplier’s possible operations in risk countries, certified management 
systems, and the occupational safety performance of the contractors. 
We also pay special attention to anti-corruption practices � We manage 
potential risks by requesting the supplier to carry out a self-assessment, 
when needed, or by performing a supplier audit. 
The Russia Division uses its own supplier qualification process that 
is based on Russian procurement law. In the Russian operations, we 
set supplier requirements for business principles, ethics, environmental 
management, and occupational health and safety practices.

 Supply chain
Supplier audits support assessments
In supplier audits, we assess the supplier’s compliance with the 
requirements in Fortum’s Supplier Code of Conduct� Audits are always 
done on-site, and they include production inspections, employee 
interviews, and reviews of documents. If non-compliances are found, 
the supplier makes a plan for corrective actions and we monitor the 
implementation of them � Fortum uses an international service provider for 
conducting audits, especially in risk countries. In Fortum’s own operating 
countries, the audits are performed mainly by own personnel. 
In 2019, a total of 14 (2018: 13) supplier audits were conducted in 
Indonesia, China, India, Vietnam, Russia and Poland. The majority of the 
non-compliances identified in the audits were related to overtime and pay 
as well as to occupational safety � Non-compliances related to freedom of 
association and employee collective bargaining rights were discovered 
with six suppliers. We issued a recommendation to two suppliers to 
strengthen their practices related to the prohibition of forced labour 
and a recommendation to three suppliers to strengthen their practices 
related to the prohibition of child labour. Additionally, we issued a 
recommendation to four suppliers to strengthen their anti-discrimination 
practices � All observations related to freedom of association and 
employee collective bargaining rights as well as to the prohibition of 
forced or child labour and discrimination were made with potential 
Fortum suppliers with whom we have not yet initiated collaboration � 
Some of the suppliers were not qualified due to poor audit results. 
Fortum uses the Bettercoal Code and tools in assessing the 
sustainability of the coal supply chain � The Bettercoal Assessment 
Programme includes the suppliers’ Letter of Commitment, self-
assessment, and site-assessment. Based on the assessment, a continuous improvement plan is drafted for the suppliers, and its 
implementation is monitored regularly � Site-assessments are always 
performed by an external assessor approved by Bettercoal. All coal 
suppliers participating in the Bettercoal programme and their status in 
the assessment process are listed in the 4Bettercoal website �
In 2019, Fortum’s Kazakhstani coal suppliers’ mines were assessed 
against the Bettercoal Code. Additionally, four Fortum coal supplier mines 
were audited in previous years. In 2018, we made a commitment that 
70% of all our coal purchases by the end of 2020 would be from suppliers 
whose mines have undergone a Bettercoal site assessment. In 2019, the 
share increased to 66%.
At the end of 2018, Bettercoal launched working groups to support its 
operations in two significant coal procurement countries for its member 
companies: Russia and Colombia � The purpose of the working groups 
is to support the suppliers participating in the Bettercoal assessment 
programme in the continuous operational improvement and to increase 
the number of suppliers participating in the programme, identify country 
risks and find ways to address them, and to improve communications 
between the different stakeholders � Fortum is a participant in the Russia 
working group’s activities �

Fortum is building solar power in India
Fortum launched its operations in India in 2012, and right from the start 
the focus has been on solar energy. The new 250-MW solar power plant, 
Pavagada 2, was commissioned in August 2019. The Pavagada 2 solar power 
plant is included in the scope of sustainability reporting in 2019. Additionally, 
a new 250-MW solar power plant is estimated to start production in 
Rajasthan state in late 2020. 
In the India operations, Fortum applies a business model based on capital 
recycling which enables continuous investments in the building of new, 
renewable capacity. At the end of 2019, Fortum operated a total of 435 MW 
of solar power capacity in India � 
India’s solar power plants are susceptible to sand dust, and they 
traditionally use water to clean the solar panels � This is a challenge in India 
where acute water shortage prevails in many places � Fortum has started to 
use robotic waterless cleaning solutions. By the end of 2019, 54% of the solar 
panels are cleaned with a robotic waterless cleaning method, and the aim is 
to increase the share to 90% by the end of 2020.Fortum eNext supplies nitrogen oxide 
reduction solutions to India
Fortum exports combustion technology solutions to 
India to reduce nitrogen oxides (NO x). Specialising in reducing emissions 
and improving energy efficiency, Fortum eNext signed in June 2019 its first 
commercial project with Hindalco Industries Limited, one of Asia’s biggest 
producers of primary aluminium. The project  enables the power plant to 
comply with the tightened restrictions on NO x emissions in India and to keep 
its emissions clearly below the permitted emission limits � With the Fortum 
eNext solution, the power plant boiler’s annual nitrogen oxide emissions will 
decrease by 60%, which means 1,500 tonnes less NO x emissions per year per 
boiler�
The main goal of the combustion technology developed by Fortum since 
the early 1990s is to significantly reduce the generation of NO x emissions in 
the combustion process primarily with burner modification. The solution also 
improves power plant efficiency through optimisation of the boiler, which 
improves energy efficiency. By the end of 2019, the solution had reduced 
a total of 800,000 tons of customers’ NO x emissions in seven European 
countries �
Fortum Bio2X a refiner of bamboo and 
paddy straw
Fortum has biorefining-related research projects 
in India. In north-east India, a joint venture owned by Fortum, the Indian 
state-owned oil refining company Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) and 
the Finnish biorefining company Chempolis is establishing a biorefinery to 
produce bioethanol, furfural, acetic acid and electricity from bamboo. The 
refinery is part of Fortum’s Bio2X research and development programme 
that is developing the refining of agro biomasses and residues into high-value products. The plant’s basic planning is nearing completion, and 
procurement of the main equipment is under way � The plant is estimated to 
start production in 2022. Raw material  sourcing chain, including sustainable 
bamboo harvesting, aims to have a positive impact on the livelihood of the 
local communities �
In September 2019, Fortum signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) on paddy straw research collaboration with India’s CCS Haryana 
Agricultural University. The goal is to produce straw-based textile fibres 
and other chemicals and materials for use in the food, forage, construction 
and other industries. The longer term goal is to establish a biorefinery using 
paddy straw as raw material �
Fortum charge & drive electrifying 
transportation in India
The Indian government is pursuing electrification of 
transportation � Fortum is supporting the effort by 
developing an EV charging network in India for traditional 
electric vehicles and for three-wheeled vehicles � Currently 
Fortum has 67 charging stations in five Indian cities: Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, 
Bengaluru, Mumbai and Ahmedabad. 
Fortum’s collaboration with the Swedish Clean Motion company offers 
an innovative battery swap service for three-wheeled vehicles � The service 
enables drivers to exchange a discharged battery for a new, charged battery 
in less than three minutes. The main target groups of the service are major 
taxi companies and other organisations operating large fleets of vehicles. 
Fortum also provides other Indian electricity charging station operators 
an opportunity to manage their infrastructure with a cloud-based SaaS 
(Software as a Service) platform. Case | Fortum is building clean energy and improving air quality in India

Human rights
Fortum supports and respects internationally 
recognised human rights, which are included in the key 
human rights treaties. Our operations have a direct or 
indirect impact on the realisation of the human rights of 
our own personnel, those working in the supply chain, 
and members of local communities.
Management of human rights issues and personnel training 
Our goal is to operate in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights, and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance 
for Responsible Business Conduct, and to apply these principles in our 
own operations as well as in country and partner risk assessments and 
supplier audits � 
Our approach to the management of human rights issues is described 
in more detail in section 4Governance and management, Sustainability 
management by topic, Human rights �
Fortum’s Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for conducting 
human rights impacts assessments and Group-level coordination and 
development of other human rights issues � 
The online training on Fortum’s Code of Conduct covers human rights-
related issues � The online training is part of the induction programme 
for new employees � The online training is continuously available to 
all employees, and the entire personnel undertakes the training in 
conjunction with the updates of Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of 
Conduct includes human rights requirements for suppliers and they are 
addressed as part of the Supplier Code of Conduct training �Assessment of human rights impacts
A human rights assessment is part of investment project planning 
especially in new operating countries � It is also part of a country and 
counterparty risk assessment. Depending on the project, we assess 
risks based on either public sources or a more in-depth assessment�  
An assessment based on public sources is always completed for all new 
countries to which one of our business units is planning to sell products 
or services. In 2019, we performed six (2018: 7) such assessments. For 
investment projects targeting risk countries, we perform an in-depth 
assessment in which we often use also external local experts. No 
in-depth assessments were carried out in 2019. 
Identified impacts on human rights and corrective 
measures
We define measures for projects to manage human rights risks to comply 
with Fortum’s own requirements and, e.g., with lender requirements. 
We also aim to support favourable impacts in collaboration with local 
communities and other stakeholders. For example, we report on 
community projects we have implemented in India in the section  
4Corporate citizenship � 
All forms of child and forced labour are strictly prohibited and 
in violation of Fortum’s Code of Conduct and the Supplier Code of 
Conduct. We have not identified risks related to the use of child or 
forced labour in our own operations � Support of employees’ right to 
freedom of association and collective bargaining are discussed in the 
section4Employee-employer relations  and the equal treatment of 
personnel in the section 4Diversity and equal opportunity �
Fortum’s supplier audits cover the most important human rights 
aspects related to purchases. The supplier audits conducted in 2019 and 
their results are described in more detail in the section 4Supply chain � Human rights-related grievances
Internal reporting channels used for reporting any suspected misconduct 
relating to labour conditions or human rights violations are defined in 
Fortum’s Code of Conduct. In addition to internal reporting channels, 
Fortum has an external “SpeakUp” channel, which is available to all 
stakeholders. In 2019, there were no grievances related to human rights 
filed through Fortum’s grievance channels, nor were there any grievances 
carried over from the previous year � During the year there was one 
grievance filed related to workplace bullying which is reported in the 
section4Diversity and equal opportunity � 
Fortum’s subsidiaries operating in Great Britain published a statement 
required by the Modern Slavery Act on our 4website � We support the 
principles defined in the Act and condemn practices that are in violation 
of the Act� We ensure compliance with our principles and Code of 
Conduct through internal monitoring and reporting practices and supplier 
assessments �

Corporate citizenship
Social responsibility is a cornerstone of Fortum’s 
operations. Our operations impact the local 
communities where our plants are located, and we 
engage in many kinds of collaboration with local 
stakeholders. We support activities promoting 
the common good in society, including the work 
of organisations and communities in our operating 
countries. Fortum also engages in collaboration with 
different research and development projects with 
universities.
Local impacts 
We are an important employer and significant tax payer in our operating 
areas. In addition, our investments improve the local infrastructure. 
Of our energy production forms, hydropower has the most 
significant 4impacts on local communities  and local forms of land use � 
Hydropower construction and use may alter the fluctuation range and 
rhythm in the discharge and water level in waterways as well as the 
fish fauna. These changes impact fishing, recreational use, and boating. 
We mitigate and compensate the adversities caused by hydropower 
production through numerous measures, such as stocking fish and 
building boat launch ramps �
We communicate openly, honestly and proactively, and we engage 
in a dialogue with the stakeholder groups located in the vicinity of our 
power plants. We carry out collaboration projects with local communities. 
We conduct environmental impact assessments (EIA) for our projects in 
accordance with legislative requirements � The hearing of stakeholders is 
part of the EIA process. In addition, relevant stakeholders are heard in all 
permit procedures �

1Collaboration with local communities
We continued publishing the Naapurina ydinvoimala (Nuclear power plant 
as a neighbour) magazine in Loviisa, Finland, and maintained an active 
dialogue with local residents and representatives of the city of Loviisa � 
We engage with local decision-makers, associations and residents in 
Riihimäki and Hausjärvi through, e.g., the collaboration meetings that 
convene twice a year. Additionally, we participate in the City of Riihimäki’s 
sustainability programme � The aim of the letter of intent we signed with 
the city in 2019 is for the district heating sold to customers to be carbon 
neutral by 2030. 
In Wrocław, Poland, Fortum continued “Clean energy for Wrocław”, a 
programme that primarily aims to develop the district heating network 
in the city centre to improve air quality. In Jelgava, Latvia, we engaged 
in dialogue with stakeholders in connection with the environmental 
assessment process of fuel diversification of the CHP plant. The plan is 
to start using RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) in addition to the biomass fuel 
currently used �
4Projects  aiming to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts 
of hydropower were under way in Finland and Sweden in collaboration with municipalities, research facilities, fishermen and universities. The 
traditional collaboration continued with local players in the Oulujoki 
water system. A barrier-free fishing area was completed in the vicinity 
of the Ämmä power plant with the help of Suomussalmi fly fishers, 
and improvements were made to the Ristijärvi municipality swimming 
beach and boat landing. Projects promoting boating were started also 
elsewhere in the Oulujoki water system. During the year we also held 
several open-door events at our hydropower plants to talk about our 
activities and to engage with local residents. In Sweden, one of the 
most popular open-doors events was held in October in Gullspång in 
conjunction with the International Year of the Salmon 2019 event. Visitors 
had an opportunity to hear about the actions to help the endangered 
Gullspång landlocked salmon, and to watch them spawn in the river 
section in its natural state a mere 100 meters from the power plant dam.
In Russia, we continued the About Energy programme, which was in 
use in 100 educational institutions, reaching about 13,000 students in 
Tyumen, Chelyabinsk, Nyagan and the Ulyanovsk region. The programme 
aims to teach students about using resources efficiently and to 
encourage them to take environmental issues into consideration in their

thinking. As part of the programme, students wrote about saving energy.  
The essays will be published in a book called “Energy Tales”. The students 
also focused on sorting waste and on water and energy consumption, 
and they conducted their own research on saving energy �
In Klaipėda, Lithuania, Fortum continued to support the conscious 
parenting centre “Saulė ir Mėnulis”. The collaboration allows a new 
generation kindergarten to develop its activities � The funds are also used 
for broadcasting local radio shows giving parents advice on how to raise 
and educate their children �
We continued supporting local communities through several projects 
in the vicinity of the Kapeli and Bhadla solar power plants in India. 
Fortum has been undertaking activities for community empowerment 
around three themes – Education, Hygiene and Women Empowerment. 
Among other things, Fortum has improved the water and electricity 
supply in the villages and has supported local schools by building a new 
classroom, constructing toilets for girls and furnishing the kitchen that 
provides lunch for the children � In the villages near the Bhadla power 
plant, a community development programme was continued. Within 
its framework, local adults have been taught to read, programmes 
to support the digital skills of teachers and students have been 
implemented, advice related to health and hygiene has been provided, 
and the livelihood of women in particular has been supported by teaching 
them tailoring and how to sew clothes on a sewing machine � The Self 
Help Group for local women continued its activities �
Support for society
According to Fortum’s Policy for Sponsoring and Donations, our 
sponsoring focuses on the wellbeing of children and youth, renewable 
energy projects, R&D, and innovations supporting Fortum’s strategy, 
recycling, recovery and reuse. In 2019, Fortum’s support for activities 
promoting the common good totalled about EUR 3.0 (2018: 3.8) million.
Additionally, we support research, education and development in the 
natural, technical and economical sciences in the energy sector through Fortum Foundation. The grants awarded by Fortum Foundation in 2019 
totalled about EUR 660,000 (2018: 680,000). Fortum Foundation is not 
part of Fortum Group �
The goal of the collaboration with universities and colleges is to 
develop Fortum’s business, promote energy-sector research and 
development, and foster Fortum’s recruiting and training opportunities. In 
2019, we participated in three EU Horizon 2020-funded research projects 
in the Baltics � The Estonian 4RELaTED project is developing an Ultra-
Low Temperature (ULT) district heating network solution. The concept 
utilises low-temperature heat sources, and it enables more efficient 
utilisation of waste heat and the reduction of CO 2 emissions. In Latvia, 
Fortum continues to take an active part in the 4THERMOS  (Thermal 
Energy Resource Modelling and Optimisation System) project. In addition, 
we joined in the 4SocialWatt project, which will develop and provide 
energy suppliers with appropriate tools for effectively engaging with their 
customers and working together towards alleviating energy poverty �
Sponsorship projects
Fortum was a main sponsor of Øyafestivalen 2019 – an annual music 
festival held in Oslo, Norway. As part of Fortum’s activities at the 
festival, Fortum launched a concept called 4“The Green Rider ”. The 
idea was to get artists to sign a pledge calling for festivals to become 
more sustainable, e.g. when providing the artist with sound, lighting and 
backstage services. In addition to several famous artists, more than one 
thousand people from the general public also signed the pledge � During 
the festival Fortum had environmental ambassadors in the festival area 
who talked with the festival visitors about environmental issues and 
about the actions that had been taken to reduce the carbon footprint of 
Øyafestivalen �
Fortum joined as a partner in Neste’s 4“Zero Island ” project in Lidö, 
Sweden. The aim of the project was to make the island climate-neutral in 
just twelve months. We delivered an 80-panel solar power system to the 
island, and we were also responsible for the renewable electricity that was transmitted through the power grid. As a result of the project, the 
island’s emissions were reduced by an impressive 78% from their previous 
levels � 
In Finland, we continued collaboration with 4Yrityskylä  and the4Crisis 
Management Initiative (CMI). The Yrityskylä is a learning environment for 
sixth-graders where students work in a profession and earn money for 
their work. In Fortum’s miniature company, students perform activities 
in various tasks related to renewable energy. The CMI is an independent 
Finnish organisation that works to prevent and resolve violent conflicts 
through informal dialogue and mediation � During Ahtisaari Days held in 
November, the organisation’s representatives visited Espoo schools with 
the goal of teaching the students skills related to conflict-resolution, 
peace mediation and reconciliation � 
At the beginning of 2020,  Fortum HorsePower  received the Best 
Sports Sponsorship Award related to the collaboration with the Helsinki 
International Horse Show. As a result of the collaboration, the electricity 
for the event was produced entirely with horse manure �
To advance Fortum’s social responsibility, we created in 2019 a new 
sustainability programme for the company. Sustainability projects, 
sponsorships, donations and local as well as university collaboration 
are grouped under the programme’s three themes: climate, people and 
materials. Implementation of the programme will begin in 2020.
Environmental cleaning as a Fortum service
Fortum’s Recycling and Waste Solutions offers innovative environmental 
cleaning solutions, like remediation of soils for restoring contaminated 
land areas and the treatment of hazardous oils and chemical waste � 
In 2019, Fortum started testing the new Multi-purpose On-site Phase 
Separator (MOPS) technology to clean contaminated sand and soil. 
The technology is currently being tested in practice in Denmark in a 
contaminated shoreline area that was previously used as a deposit site for 
toxic waste from a chemical factory. MOPS removes mercury, pesticides 
and other toxins from contaminated sand. 
Fortum’s new technology not only cleans the sand, it also converts 
the toxic waste into a raw material that can be used in the construction 
industry, among others. After the technology testing with sand has been 
completed, Fortum plans to test MOPS also with other waste streams. 
The aim is to complete the pilot plant tests during the first quarter 
of 2020. 
4Cleaning contaminated sand using MOPS technology in Denmark
Plogging – cleaning urban landscapes and rivers 
while exercising
Plogging, i.e. rubbish runs, is a new way to combine exercise and picking 
up litter � Plogging can also be done in water by picking up litter while 
kayaking. In 2019, Fortum participated in a variety of jogging and paddling 
events to clean up urban landscapes and rivers in several of our operating 
countries �
Since 2018, Fortum has arranged a total of nine plogging events in 
Finland together with the “Siivouspäivä” brand. The highlight of 2019 was 
the participation in Finland’s biggest running event, Helsinki City Run, as a plogging team. In 2019, Fortum held plogging events also in Stockholm 
(Sweden), Ulyanovsk (Russia), and in Gdańsk, Warsaw, Łódź and Wrocław 
(Poland). Additionally, Fortum personnel in Gdańsk and in Warsaw 
participated in a kayaking river clean-up event with the residents of 
Gdańsk.
Young people helping river clean-up in Sweden
Rivers are a valuable natural resource for Fortum, and we want to help 
them remain healthy and clean. Since 2013, Fortum has collaborated 
with the environmental organisation Städa Sverige (part of a local sports 
organisation), and has encouraged local youth in Sweden to take part in 
clean-up efforts on five rivers where Fortum has hydropower plants. The 
initiative is called Älvstädningen, and in 2019 it succeeded in cleaning 
about 23 tonnes of waste from rivers. This year, the initiative started 
paying attention also to the water quality of the rivers by taking samples 
and analysing the microplastics. The 2019 analysis revealed that four of 
the ten river water samples contained polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic.
In addition to cleaning up rivers, Älvstädningen helps Fortum to increase 
young peoples’ knowledge of hydropower as a renewable energy source � 
It is also a great way to give local youth an opportunity to make a tangible 
impact on the environment and to get them to join the change for a 
cleaner world �Case  |  Cleaning the environment, on land and in the water

Governance and management
Sustainability management at Fortum is strategy-
driven and is based on the company’s values, the 
Code of Conduct, the Supplier Code of Conduct, 
the Sustainability Policy and other policies and their 
specifying instructions defined at the Group level.
We comply with laws and regulations � All of our operations are guided by 
good governance, effective risk management, adequate controls and the 
internal audit principles supporting them � 
Fortum’s goal is a high level of environmental and safety management 
in all business activities. Calculated in terms of sales, 99.8% (2018: 99.9%) 
of Fortum’s electricity and heat production operations at the end of 
2019 were ISO 14001 environmentally certified and 96.5% (2018: 97 .0%) 
were either OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001 safety-certified. The decrease 
in safety certification coverage was due to Fortum Oslo Varme, whose 
operations are not yet certified. The divisions and sites develop their 
operations with internal and external audits required by environmental, 
occupational safety and quality management systems �Responsibilities
As sustainability is an integral part of Fortum’s strategy and operations, 
the highest decision making on sustainability and climate-related matters 
falls on the duties of the members of the Board of Directors, who 
share joint responsibility for these matters. Therefore, Fortum has not 
established a specific Sustainability Committee for the decision making 
on economic, environmental and social matters. The Audit and Risk 
Committee, members of the Fortum Executive Management, and other 
senior executives support the Board of Directors in the decision-making 
in these matters, when necessary. 
Fortum Executive Management decides on the sustainability approach 
and Group-level sustainability targets that guide annual planning � The 
targets are ultimately approved by Fortum’s Board of Directors � Fortum 
Executive Management monitors the achievement of the targets 
in its monthly meetings and in quarterly performance reviews � The 
achievement of the targets is regularly reported also to Fortum’s  
Board of Directors � 
Fortum’s line management is responsible for the implementation of 
the Group’s policies and instructions and for day-to-day sustainability 
management� Realisation of the safety targets is a part of Fortum’s 
short-term incentive programme. In December 2019 Fortum’s Board of 
Directors also approved inclusion of total CO 2 emissions from energy 
production as part of the earnings criteria for the 2020–2022 long-term 
incentive plan for key employees and executives.Fortum’s Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for coordination 
and development of sustainability at the Group level and for maintaining 
an adequate situation awareness and oversight regarding sustainability �

Management of economic responsibility
Description
Targets and approach For Fortum economic responsibility means competitiveness, performance excellence and 
market-driven production that creates long-term value for our stakeholders and enables 
sustainable growth. Satisfied customers are key to our success and active consumers will have 
a crucial role in the future energy system � Fortum has indirect responsibility for its supply chain � 
We conduct business with companies that act responsibly � 
Each new research and development project is assessed against the criteria of carbon dioxide 
emissions reduction and resource efficiency. Likewise, new investment proposals are assessed 
against sustainability criteria as part of Fortum’s investment assessment and approval process � 
In our investments we seek economically profitable alternatives that provide the opportunity to 
increase capacity and reduce emissions � 
We measure financial performance with the return on capital employed (long-term target: at 
least 10%) and capital structure (long-term target: comparable net debt / EBITDA around 2.5x). 
The realisation of financial targets in 2019 is reported in the Financial performance and position 
section of the 4Financials.
Policies and commitments The financial management system is based on Group-level policies and their specifying 
instructions, and on good governance, effective risk management, sufficient controls and the 
internal audit principles supporting them. Other key elements steering financial management are 
presented in the section 4Policies and commitments �
Responsibilities The CFO and the Group’s Financial unit, division management, and ultimately the CEO and the 
Board of Directors are responsible for issues related to finances and financial statements and for 
broader financial responsibility issues. 
Our sustainability responsibilities are presented in the section 4Governance and management �
Monitoring and follow-up The Board decides on the company’s financial targets as a part of the annual business planning 
process � Realisation of the targets is monitored on monthly basis both at the division level and 
by Fortum Executive Management. Fortum’s management monitors the realisation of financial 
targets quarterly as part of the business performance assessment, and key indicators are 
regularly reported to Fortum’s Board of Directors � Financial key indicators related to investments 
are monitored in divisions’ investment forums and by Fortum Executive Management. 
We report regularly on the direct and indirect financial impacts on our most important 
stakeholder groups � Fortum also uses the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards indicators to 
measure economic responsibility �Management of environmental responsibility
Description
Targets and approach Fortum’s aim is to provide its customers with environmentally benign products and services � 
We strive to continuously reduce the environmental impacts of our operations by using best 
available practices and technologies. We emphasise a circular economy, resource and energy 
efficiency, the use of waste and biomass, and climate change mitigation in our environmental 
responsibility. Our company’s know-how in carbon dioxide-free hydro and nuclear power 
production and in energy-efficient combined heat and power production, investments in solar 
and wind power, as well as solutions for sustainable cities play a key role in environmental 
responsibility � We measure the realisation of the environmental responsibility with the following 
indicators, for which we have set 4Group-level targets :
• Specific CO 2 emissions 
• Energy efficiency 
• Energy availability of CHP plants
• Major EHS incidents 
• Quality of investigation process of occupational accidents, major EHS incidents, and near 
misses 
• GAP index, quality of implementation of EHS minimum standards
Additionally, we have a Group-level target for the number of supplier audits.
Policies and commitments Environmental management is based on Fortum’s Sustainability Policy. Other key elements 
steering environmental management are presented in the section 4Policies and commitments � 
We assess environmental risks as part of the Group’s risk assessment process � The risk 
assessment process is reported in the section Operating and financial review/Risk management 
of the4Financials � Climate-related risks are reported in the section 4Climate and resources: 
Climate.
Responsibilities Our sustainability responsibilities are presented in the section 4Governance and management �
Monitoring and follow-up The Group’s key indicators are reported regularly to Fortum’s Board of Directors and are 
published in Fortum’s interim reports. Major EHS incidents are reported monthly, specific CO 2 
emissions, energy availability of CHP plants, the quality of investigation process of major EHS 
incidents and the GAP index are reported quarterly, and energy-efficiency improvement is 
reported annually to Fortum Executive Management.
The divisions and sites follow and develop their operations with audits required by environmental 
management systems � 
Internal and external auditors regularly audit our ISO 14001 standard-compliant management 
system. The CO 2 emissions of plants within the sphere of the EU’s emission trading scheme are 
audited annually on a per plant basis by an external verifier accredited by the emissions trading 
authority. The verification addresses the reliability, credibility and accuracy of the monitoring 
system and the reported data and information relating to emissions � The plants must annually 
submit to the authorities a verified emissions report of the previous calendar year’s carbon 
dioxide emissions. 
Our supply chain monitoring system covers also environmental responsibility and is presented in 
the section 4Personnel and society: Supply chain.  
We map our stakeholders’ views annually with the One Fortum survey and with separate 
sustainability surveys �

Reporting principles
We report on sustainability in this Sustainability Report. 
Non-financial reporting, in line with the Accounting Act, 
is included in the Operating and Financial Review in 
the Financials. Additionally, we describe sustainability-
related governance practices in the Corporate 
Governance Statement, and strategy and the CEO’s 
view in the CEO’s Business Review. Our reporting entity 
also includes the Tax Footprint.
We apply the specific disclosures of the GRI Sustainability Reporting 
Standards we have identified as material.
We gain information about our stakeholders’ views through the 
One Fortum Survey, the stakeholder sustainability survey and other 
stakeholder collaboration. Our selection of sustainability priorities 
is based on the materiality analysis conducted in 2019 in which we 
surveyed Fortum personnel’s and our stakeholders’ views on priority 
themes for us � We report sustainability information annually in Finnish 
and English � In our annual reporting we describe Fortum’s operations in 
2019 as well as some information from January–February 2020.
The previous reporting was published in March 2019, and our next 
reporting will be published in spring 2021. In addition to the annual 
reporting, we report on our sustainability activities in Fortum’s interim 
reports�  
Reporting scope and boundaries 
Reporting related to operations and management covers all functions 
under Fortum’s control, including subsidiaries in all countries of operation. 
The figures for power and heat generation and investments include 
also figures from Fortum’s share in associated companies and joint 
ventures that sell their production to the owners at cost� Possible 
deviations to these principles are reported in conjunction with information applying different boundaries � A list of Fortum’s subsidiaries is included 
in the4Financial Statements  Note 40 Subsidiaries by segment on 
31 December 2019.
Information from previous years is mainly presented on the basis of the 
organisation and the functions of each year; the impacts of ownership 
changes in production facilities, for example, have not been updated 
afterwards in the previous figures. 
Stockholm Exergi is treated in the Financial Statements as a joint 
venture and Uniper as an associated company � Both companies are 
consolidated with the equity method. Stockholm Exergi and Uniper are 
not included in Fortum’s sustainability targets and indicators nor in the 
descriptions of management practices. Stockholm Exergi’s and Uniper’s 
sustainability information are available in the companies’ sustainability 
reports that can be found on the companies’ own web pages. Exceptions 
to the accounting practice are presented in conjunction with each figure.
Capacity changes
In 2019, Fortum commissioned the 250-MW Pavagada 2 solar power 
plant in India. In the end of the year, we commissioned the first wind 
turbines of the total 97-MW Sørfjord wind power park in Norway. The 
new capacity is included in the reporting starting from its commissioning � 
In December 2019, Fortum signed an agreement to sell an 80% stake 
in its Nordic wind power portfolio � The transaction is part of Fortum’s 
capital recycling business model; the model is used in Nordic wind power 
and in solar power in India �
Measurement and calculation principles 
Data for economic performance indicators are collected from the audited 
Financial Statements and from financial accounting and consolidation 
systems � 
The environmental information of the report covers the plants for 
which Fortum is the legal holder of the environmental permit� In such 
cases, the plant information is reported in its entirety. Fortum utilises a Group-wide database with instructions for collecting 
site-level environmental data. Sites are responsible for data input, 
emissions calculations and the accuracy of the information provided � The 
Corporate Sustainability unit compiles the data at the Group level and is 
responsible for the disclosed sustainability information � 
Fortum’s CO 2 emissions subject to the EU emissions trading system 
(EU ETS) are annually verified at the site level by external verifiers. Direct 
and indirect greenhouse gas emissions have been reported in accordance 
with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol on the basis of the Greenhouse 
Gas Analysis performed by an external consultant. 
Fortum’s human resources (HR) management system is used in all 
Fortum’s operating countries and is the main system for employee-
related personal and job data. In Russia, the employee data system 
covers mainly superiors. In addition, Russian operations have their own, 
local data system �
Other social responsibility data, such as occupational health-related 
data, originates from various data systems. Designated individuals collect 
the information and deliver it to the Corporate Sustainability unit primarily 
in the format recommended by the GRI Standards �

 Limited assurance report on GHG emissions
Independent limited assurance report on Fortum’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2019 
To the Management of Fortum Corporation
We have been engaged by Fortum Corporation (hereafter: Fortum) to 
provide a limited assurance on Fortum’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
calculations (Scope 1, 2 and 3) based on Fortum’s Reporting criteria 
according to the requirements published by CDP (Verification of Climate 
Data) for the reporting period of January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 
(hereafter: GHG Emissions Disclosures).  The calculations subject to 
the assurance engagement is presented on pages 29-30 in the section 
“Climate” of Fortum’s Sustainability Reporting 2019 (hereafter: GHG 
Reporting).
Management’s responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation of the GHG Reporting 
in accordance with the reporting criteria as set out in Fortum’s 
Reporting principles and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (hereafter: 
Reporting criteria). This responsibility includes: designing, implementing 
and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and 
fair presentation of the GHG Reporting that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, selecting and applying 
appropriate criteria and making estimates that are reasonable in the 
circumstances �
Assurance provider’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the 
reported GHG Emissions Disclosures within Fortum’s GHG Reporting 
based on our engagement. Our assurance report is made in accordance 
with the terms of our engagement with Fortum � We do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than Fortum for our work, for this 
assurance report, or for the conclusions we have reached. 
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410 to 
provide a limited assurance on GHG Emissions Disclosures � This Standard 
requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain a limited assurance whether any 
matters come to our attention that cause us to believe that the GHG 
Emissions Disclosures have not been presented, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the reporting criteria � 
We did not perform any assurance procedures on the prospective 
information, such as targets, expectations and ambitions. Consequently, 
we draw no conclusion on the prospective information � 
A limited assurance engagement with respect to the GHG Emissions 
Disclosures involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about 
the reported GHG Emissions � The procedures performed depend on 
the practitioner’s judgment, but their nature is different from, and their 
extent is less than, a reasonable assurance engagement. It does not 
include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness 
of processes and internal controls and consequently they do not enable 
us to obtain the assurance necessary to become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.
Our procedures on this engagement included:
• A review of management systems, reporting and data compilation 
processes related to the calculations presented on pages 29 and 30 in 
the Fortum’s Sustainability Reporting 2019.
• Selected interviews of persons conducting Scope 1, 2 and 3 analysis 
and data owners
• Review of assumptions and emission factors used in calculations
• Analytical testing of consolidated data
• Testing of source data on spot check basis 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion �
Our independence, quality control and competences
We complied with Deloitte’s independence policies which address and, 
in certain cases, exceed the requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants in their role as independent assurance providers and in 
particular preclude us from taking financial, commercial, governance 
and ownership positions which might affect, or be perceived to affect, 
our independence and impartiality and from any involvement in the 
preparation of the report � We have maintained our independence and 
objectivity throughout the year and there were no events or prohibited 
services provided which could impair our independence and objectivity. 
Deloitte Oy applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 
and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control 
including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements � This engagement was conducted by a 
multidisciplinary team including assurance and GHG Reporting expertise 
with professional qualifications. Our team is experienced in providing 
reporting assurance�
Conclusion
On the basis of the procedures we have performed, nothing has come 
to our attention that causes us to believe that the GHG Emissions 
Disclosures subject to the assurance engagement is not prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria. 
Our assurance statement should be read in conjunction with the 
inherent limitations of accuracy and completeness of the GHG Reporting �
