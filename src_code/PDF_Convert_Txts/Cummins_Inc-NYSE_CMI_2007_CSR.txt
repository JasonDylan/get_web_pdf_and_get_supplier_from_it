I am Cummins.
I know  what  my company  stands  for. I am 
ready  to carry  out its mission  of returning  
value  to our customers,  shareholders  and 
communities‚Äîand  to be a good  steward  
of the environment  along  the way.  I bring  
my unique  perspective  to work  every  
day, as do thousands  of my colleagues  
around  the world.  Together  we create  
a rich diversity  of cultures  and  views.  I 
understand  my company‚Äôs  vision  includes  
all the communities  we serve  around  the 
globe,  not just my own.  And I believe  my 
success  will contribute  to the success  
of everyone  we serve,  everywhere.  
I am Cummins.  You can depend  on me. About  this Report

companies  around  the world  to voluntarily  
report  on the economic,  environmental  and 
social  components  of their  business.  
Started  in 1997  by the Coalition  for 
Environmentally  Responsible  Economies  
(CERES),  the GRI became  independent  in 
2002  and today  works  in collaboration  with 
the United  Nations  Environment  Program

make  a difference,  not just today,  but for 
future  generations  as well.  Contacts

96 Cummins  Foundation  ReportTable  of Contents  Throughout  its history,  Cummins  has been  
committed  to corporate  responsibility  and 
the goal  of improving  the communities  
where  our employees  live and work.  The 
primary  driver  behind  this ongoing  effort  is 
the enthusiasm  of thousands  of individuals  
who have  donated  countless  hours  of their  
personal  time  to projects  and programs  that 
make  people‚Äôs  lives  better.
Employees  also have  an ongoing  interest  
in the environment  and global  climate  
change.  While  Cummins  is a leader  in 
developing  new  products  to meet  tough  
emission  standards,  I am equally  impressed  
by the work  people  in our plants  are doing  
to reduce  energy  usage  and focus  on the 
prudent  use of our natural  resources.  Not only is it the right  thing  to do, but it makes  
good  business  sense  for the Company.
Corporate  responsibility  and working  
toward  a cleaner,  healthier,  safer  
environment  are primary  components  of 
Cummins‚Äô  commitment  to sustainability.  
We are also very serious  about  our 
obligations  to the Company‚Äôs  stakeholders,  
including  shareholders,  employees,  
customers  and suppliers.  We have  had 
a number  of achievements  on their  behalf  
since  our last Sustainability  Report.  
Highlights  of our efforts  include:

Diversity
We embrace  the diverse  perspectives  of all people  
and honor  both  with dignity  and respect.  
Global  Involvement  
We seek  a world  view  and to act without  boundaries.  Strategic  Principles  
Cummins  has five key elements  to its business  
strategy.  This strategy  has not changed  in 
recent  years.  What  has changed  is our improved  
performance  and our continued  ability  to deliver  
on commitments.  
Being  a low cost  producer  
Cummins  realizes  that to successfully  compete  in 
the marketplace,  it must  offer  the best  products  
at the best  prices.  To do that,  we leverage  our 
innovative  technology,  economies  of scale,  global  
presence  and customer  partnerships.  
5IF4JY4JHNBRVBMJUZQSPHSBNMBVODIFEJO
is an integral  part of that strategy.  Since  the 
program‚Äôs  inception,  Cummins  has completed

 6\Y7YVMPSLThe Company  estimates  this program  
generates  savings  of approximately  2 
percent  of annual  revenue  per year,  
while  infusing  quality  into every  process.  
Cummins  also has expanded  the program  
to include  processes  with customers,  
suppliers,  distributors  and corporate  social  
responsibility  with positive  results.  
Cummins  pursues  cost  leadership  in other  
ways:  through  global  sourcing,  global  
research  and development  access,  sharing  
development  costs  with original  equipment  
manufacturer  (OEM)  partners  and technical  
productivity,  including  the use of computer  
design  and modeling  instead  of building  
expensive  physical  prototypes.  
Profitable  growth  
The Company  will continue  to focus  its 
growth  initiatives  on related  businesses  
where  it can use its existing  investments  
in products  or technology,  leading  brand  
names  or market  presence  to establish  
a competitive  advantage.  The focus  is 
on ventures  that complement  its capital-
intensive  and cyclical  core  businesses,  for 
example,  the production  of light-duty  diesel  
engines  in an existing  Cummins  facility  that 
will introduce  Cummins  to a new  consumer  
customer  base.  
Creating  shareholder  value  
Return  on capital‚Äîspecifically  return  on 
average  net assets  (ROANA)  and return  on 
equity  (ROE)‚Äîis  our primary  measure  of 
financial  performance.  Each  of our business  
segments  uses  ROANA  targets  and the 
Company,  as a whole,  has an ROE  target.  Cummins  has dramatically  improved  
its return  on capital  in recent  years;  for 
example,  since  1999  (the last peak  in the 
heavy-duty  truck  cycle),  ROE  has increased  
from 10 percent  to 20.8  percent  in 2007.  
ROANA  in 2007  was 28.9  percent.
Complementary  businesses  that 
work  together  to create  value  
Increasingly,  Cummins  looks  for ways  
to leverage  the synergies  among  its four 
business  segments.  These  synergies  
capitalize  on shared  capabilities  including  
technology,  distribution  systems,  common  
customers  (cross  selling),  joint venture  
partners  for global  growth  and cost  
reduction  through  the larger  scale  of 
shared  services.  
Creating  the right  environment  
At Cummins,  creating  the right  environment  
for success  means  an inclusive,  learning  
environment  that is reinforced  by a 
performance  ethic  that attracts,  develops  
and retains  high-quality  talent.  We 
measure  our success  through  strategic  
skill and competency  mapping,  leadership  
development  outcomes  and participation   
in tailored  individual  development  and 
training  programs.‚ÄúOn any given   
day, there  are  
approximately   
12,000  people  in  
our workforce   
involved  in  
Six Sigma   
projects  ‚Äì  
helping  us work   
smarter,  produce   
better  products   
and making  our  
customers  more   
successful.‚Äù

Our brand  is the sum  total  of all our years  in 
business.  From  the beginning,  when  the Company‚Äôs  
founders  first stood  behind  the products  they  sold  
to the ongoing  growth  of our diversified  business,  
Cummins  has maintained  a reputation  for integrity.  
In terms  of a brand,  that translates  into a single  
vision:  dependability.  We want  stakeholders  to 
know  they  can depend  on Cummins.  And we want  
employees  to be able  to unify  around  the Cummins  
brand  to create  value  and a competitive  advantage.  Who We Are
Cummins  roots  are planted  in soil nourished  by 
innovation,  persistence  and a commitment  to 
community.  Founded  in Columbus,  Ind.,  in 1919  as 
the Cummins  Engine  Company,  for its namesake  
Clessie  Lyle Cummins,  the fledgling  firm was among  
the first to see the commercial  potential  of an 
unproven  engine  technology  invented  two decades  
earlier  by Rudolph  Diesel.
The Company  has grown  to be a global  power  
leader.  Today,  half of Cummins  37,800  employees  
and half the Company‚Äôs  sales  are from  outside  the 
United  States.  
Since  the early  part of the decade,  we have  reshaped

diversified,  more  results-oriented  and committed  to 
turning  a greater  share  of its sales  into profits.  We 
have adapted  to changes  in the competitive  landscape  
by vertically  integrating  through  partnerships  with Cummins  employees  share  information  
about  their  award-winning  projects  at the 
annual  Six Sigma  Expo.

must  deliver  value  to shareholders,  it also 
strives  to responsibly  and effectively  serve  
all stakeholders  ‚Äì customers,  employees,  
business  partners  and the communities  in 
which  it operates.  
The Company  actively  engages  all 
stakeholders,  seeking  feedback  and doing  
its best  to keep  them  informed  of Cummins‚Äô  
actions  and performance.  The Company‚Äôs  
policies  reflect  a commitment  to financial  
excellence,  environmental  stewardship,  
workplace  equity,  corporate  responsibility  
and fair competition.  
Our activities  related  to the community

Customers  
Cummins  is dedicated  to exceeding  the 
expectations  of its customers,  making  
products  and providing  support  that give 
customers  a competitive  advantage  in  
the marketplace.  
Cummins  works  with key customers  
during  development  and production  to 
ensure  that products  are manufactured  to 
the customers‚Äô  satisfaction.  Increasingly,  
Cummins  is using  Six Sigma  tools  to help  
its customers  and suppliers  reduce  costs  
and improve  quality.  
The Company‚Äôs  goal  for using  Six Sigma  
with customers  is to create  the shared  
belief  that Cummins  cares  as much  about  the customer‚Äôs  business  as the customers  
themselves.  Cummins  currently  has 
approximately  220 active  customer-focused  
Six Sigma  projects  and has completed  
nearly  640 projects  since  2005.
 
In some  cases,  Cummins  has sent   
Six Sigma  ‚Äúbelts‚Äù  to work  directly  with  
a customer  to solve  a specific  challenge.   
In other  instances,  Cummins  has trained  
and provided  support  to belts  working   
for our customers.  Some  recent   
examples  of Cummins‚Äô  customer-focused  
Six Sigma  efforts:
‚Ä¢	Reducing 	a	customer‚Äôs 	soot	filter	field

aftertreatment  system.
‚Ä¢	Increasing 	the	fuel	filter	change	interval

‚Ä¢	Increasing 	a	co-generation 	plant‚Äôs	
average  monthly  availability  to  
90 percent  and meeting  all emissions  
requirements  of the operating  permit.
Customer  Care   
One of the biggest  challenges  for Cummins  
in our extremely  competitive  global  business  
environment  is becoming  and staying  the 
first choice  of customers.  That  is why 
Cummins  launched  its Customer  Support  
Excellence  (CSE)  initiative.  
As a company,  we realize  it is not enough  
to develop  the most  innovative  technology  
or build  the most  dependable  engines.  Our 
customers  have  to believe,  and we must  
show  them,  we care  as much  about  their  Commitment  to Stakeholders  
‚ÄúCummins  
can create  an 
advantage  over  
our competitors  
when  we

our customer‚Äôs  
feelings  
and provide  
a positive  
experience  for 
him or her.‚Äù

The Cummins  Dodge  Ram  pickup  heavy-duty  engine  received  top 
honors  among  the 2007  winners  of Chrysler‚Äôs  environmental  awards.  
Cummins  was a winner  in the Product  Related  Environmental  
Protection  category.
In 2007,  new  heavy-duty  diesel  engine  emission  regulations  took  
effect  in the United  States  that required  the diesel-powered  Dodge

is designed  to reduce  waste,  improve  
quality,  increase  responsiveness  and 
develop  people.  
The COS  consists  of 10 operating  practices  
that are common  across  the Company.  
It is supported  by nine common  functions,

and	future	outlook.	Top	executives 	hold	quarterly	
teleconferences  with industry  analysts  to discuss  
financial  results.  Company  representatives  also host

year,  and meet  or talk directly  with individual  analysts  
and investors  on nearly  a daily  basis.  Cummins‚Äô  positive  corporate  governance  practices

quality,  technologically  advanced  products.  
We continuously  work  with customers  
to develop  new  products  to improve  the 
performance  of their  vehicles,  equipment  
or systems  at competitive  cost  levels.  We 
are a leader  in developing  technologies  
to reduce  diesel  engine  emissions,  a key 
concern  of our customers  and regulators  
around  the world.  
We were  able  to meet  the EPA‚Äôs  2007  
heavy-duty  on-highway  emissions  
standards  that went  into effect  on  
January  1, 2007,  and we announced

We have  also developed  low-emission,  
high-performance  natural  gas engines  
as an alternative-fuel  option  for the 
on-highway,  industrial  and power  
generation  markets.  Our technology

at lower  costs.  
For example,  we have  both  customer  and  
supplier  arrangements  with Komatsu,  Ltd.,  
including  manufacturing  joint ventures  and a 
product  development  joint venture  that has 
led to the development  of several  engines.  
We are also the exclusive  supplier  of 
engines  for Komatsu  mining  equipment.
In addition,  we have  been  the exclusive  
diesel  engine  supplier  to Chrysler  for its 
Dodge  Ram  truck  since  1988.  We have  
long-term  agreements  with Volvo  and 
International  Truck  and Engine  Corporation  
for the supply  of heavy-duty  truck  engines  
and with PACCAR  for the supply  of both  
heavy-duty  and medium-duty  engines.  
These  agreements  afford  us long-term  price  
stability  and eliminate  certain  dealer  and 
end-user  discounts,  while  offering  closer  
integration  on product  development.  
Global  Presence.   We have  a strong  
global  presence  including  a worldwide  
distribution  system,  manufacturing  and 
engineering  facilities  and a network  of global  
supply  sources.  Our worldwide  presence  
has enabled  us to take  advantage  of growth

20                                     Cummins Inc. 2007 Sustainability ReportLeading  Technology;  Driven  by Zeus
Cummins  has produced  dependable  marine  engines  since  the 1920s,  but it recently  
took an innovative  new approach  when,  as part of a joint venture,  it created  an 
advanced  propulsion  system  called  Zeus.  
Zeus delivers  up to 30 percent  better  fuel economy,  up to 550 horsepower,  a proven  
level of safety  and unsurpassed  handling  at high and low speeds.  The system  was  
15	years	in	development 	at	Cummins 	MerCruiser 	Diesel,	Brunswick 	and	Mercury	Marine.	
Zeus incorporates  a familiar  looking,  yet totally  new pod with counter-rotating  stainless  
steel,	rear-facing 	propellers 	and	a	through-hub 	exhaust.	Independent 	vectoring	for	each	
pod delivers  dramatically  improved  high-speed  handling.  Docking  is easier  than  ever.  
These  steerable  pods,  along  with an advanced  joystick  control  system,  deliver  precise  
turning	and	tight	maneuvering, 	keeping	a	Zeus-equipped 	vessel	on	a	fixed	heading	
within  a tight  area,  even  in strong  currents  and windy  conditions.  An intelligent  station-
keeping  system  reads  GPS  coordinates  and keeps  the boat  in position  without  the 
captain  having  to touch  the wheel  or controls.
And safety  is engineered  in the product.  If the pod strikes  debris  or bottom,  the gear  
case and skeg  (the fin at the stern  of the boat)  protect  the propellers.  In the event  of a 
catastrophic  collision  above  the depth  of the keel,  the gear  case  is designed  to shear  
away  and remain  water  tight  so  there  is no compromise  of hull integrity.  
‚ÄúZeus-powered 	boats	track	true	and	respond	instantly	to	helm	commands,‚Äù 	 
said Motor  Boating  magazine  in its 2007  review.  The first orders  for the system   
were taken  early  in 2007.  The Zeus   
highly  advanced  
propulsion  
system  
offers  up to 
30 percent  
better  fuel 
economy  and 
unsurpassed  
handling  at 
high and low 
speeds.  In 
addition,  a
Zeus-equipped  
vessel  delivers  
precise  turning  
and tight  
maneuvering  
even in strong  
currents  
and windy  
conditions.

the Code  easier  to find,  read  and understand.  
The updated  Code,  which  was approved  by  
senior	leadership 	and	the	Cummins 	Board	of	
Directors, 	is	built	around	10	‚ÄúStatements 	of	Ethical	
Principles‚Äù 	that	provide	the	foundation 	for	ethical	
behavior  at Cummins.  The principles  are backed   
by Corporate  Policies  and other  key documents  
that give specific  guidance  on topics  and issues  
addressed  by the statements.
The 10 Statements  of Ethical  Principles  are: 
‚Ä¢	We	will	follow	the	law	everywhere.
‚Ä¢	We	will	embrace	diverse	perspectives 	and	
backgrounds,  and treat  all people  with dignity   
and respect.
‚Ä¢	We	will	compete	fairly	and	honestly.‚Ä¢	We	will	avoid	conflicts	of	interest.
‚Ä¢	We	will	demand	that	everything 	we	do	leads	 
to a cleaner,  healthier  and safer  environment.
‚Ä¢	We	will	protect	our	technology, 	our	information 	 
and our intellectual  property.
‚Ä¢	We	will	demand	that	our	financial	records	and	
processes  are accurate  and that our reporting  
processes  are clear  and understandable.
‚Ä¢	We	will	strive	to	improve	our	communities.
‚Ä¢	We	will	communicate 	with	honesty	and	integrity.
‚Ä¢	We	will	create	a	culture	where	all	employees 	take	
responsibility  for ethical  behavior.
Work  on the updated  Code  began  in 2007   
and the effort  included  feedback  from  Cummins

Cummins  is committed  to ensuring  that its 
employees,  and those  with whom  it does  
business,  follow  all applicable  laws  in the 
locations  we do business.
Since  late 2005,  Cummins  has introduced  
six online  compliance  training  courses  
targeted  at the appropriate  employee  
groups.  This training  includes:
‚Ä¢	Code	of	Business	Conduct
‚Ä¢	Treatment 	of	Each	Other	at	Work
‚Ä¢	Export	Controls
‚Ä¢	Federal	Corrupt	Practices	Act*
‚Ä¢	Antitrust

These  courses  are made  in multiple  
languages  where  necessary  and employee  
completion  is tracked.  Altogether,  more  
than 51,000  training  subscriptions  have  
been  offered  to employees  since  late 2005  Code  will continue  well into 2008  as the 
Code  is translated  into multiple  languages  
and employee  training  materials  are updated.  
New to this version  are question  and answer  
sections  to illustrate  each  of the principles  
in action,  enhanced  contact  information  and 
a section  on ‚Äúliving  the Code.‚Äù  The Code  
features  a set of ‚ÄúFAQs‚Äù  to help  employees  
find other  resources  related  to the Code  
and for reporting  ethical  concerns.  The 
Company  also has increased  its commitment  
to updating  the Code  by creating  a process  
to annually  review  and solicit  employee  
feedback  on the Code  and supporting  
policies  and information.

trust in the Company‚Äôs  ethics  investigation  process.   
Those  who  report  about  any topic  are protected  
under  the Company‚Äôs  anti-retaliation  policy.
Cummins  has a global  team  of trained  Master  
Investigators  who  investigate  complaints  and ensure  
that appropriate  action  is taken  in a timely  fashion.  
In 2007,  Cummins  investigated  541 ethics-related  
complaints,  compared  to 264 in 2006.  The numbers  
grew  because  of increased  training  and promotion  
of the reporting  process.  Of the cases  investigated  
in 2007,  46 percent  resulted  in a finding  that the

more  than  130 
audit  reports  
and audit  
memos  covering  
functions  and 
businesses  
around  the globe.with a great  place  to work.   In that time,  the 
Company  has conducted  56 diversity  audits  
at 30 sites  in the United  States  and Europe.
The audits  are conducted  by teams  of 
four to eight  employees  with diverse  
backgrounds  who  have  no direct  connection  
to the site being  audited.   The team  tours  
the	facility	and	also	examines 	satisfaction 	
surveys,  training  records,  personnel  
files and other  documents  to ensure  full 
legal compliance  and assess  the work  
environment. 		The	audit	also	examines 	
the diversity  of employees  and the site‚Äôs  
commitment  to creating  an inclusive  and 
representative  workforce.
A key component  of the audit  involves   
team  members  conducting  confidential   
one-on-one  interviews  with a randomly  
selected	cross	section	of	approximately 	 
10 percent  of the site‚Äôs  workforce.   
Employees  are asked  a variety  of  
questions  regarding  their  work  environment,  
knowledge  of workplace  policies  and 
procedures,  and their  perceptions  as to 
whether  local  management  is committed  
to the Company‚Äôs  values,  most  notably  our 
Code	of	Business	Conduct,	Treatment 	of	
Each  Other  at Work  policy  and diversity.   
Results  of the audits  are shared  with local  
management  and with the Company‚Äôs  
senior  leadership.   If issues  are discovered,  
the site must  create  an action  plan  to 
address  issues.   Currently,  the Company  
conducts  audits  at its facilities  in the United  
States	and	Europe	and	is	exploring	how	to	
expand	the	program	to	locations	in	other	
parts  of the world.In	2007,	the	Company 	completed 	a	Six	
Sigma  quality  project  aimed  at reducing  
the time  necessary  to close  investigations.  
As a result,  the average  time  to close  fell 
from more  than  60 days  at the end of 
2006  to just under  20 days  at the end of 
2007,  despite  an increased  number  of 
investigations  over  that period.  
The Company‚Äôs  reporting  system  and its 
commitment  to investigate,  take  action  and 
protect  those  who  raise  concerns  help  us 
bring	our	Code	of	Business	Conduct	to	life.
 
Ethics  Certification  Process
In 2007,  more  than  10,000  Cummins  
employees  completed  an Ethics  
Certification  in which  they  certified  their  
compliance  with the Company‚Äôs  Code  of 
Business	Conduct	and	underlying 	policies	
and	reported	any	exceptions 	to	Company

Diversity  Audits
Rigorous  diversity  audits  have  been  
conducted  at Cummins‚Äô  facilities  for  
more  than  a decade  and are today  a 
central  component  of our efforts  to ensure  
that employees  enjoy  a positive,  safe and 
productive  work  environment.  
The process  began  in 1997,  led by the 
Cummins  Law  Department,  and is focused  
on making  sure  that our locations  are in 
compliance  with the laws,  are operating  
in a way consistent  with our commitment  
to diversity  and equal  opportunity,  and are

helps  the Audit  Committee  ensure  the integrity  of the Supplier  Code  of Conduct
Cummins  places  a premium  on doing  business  with 
companies  that share  its values  and that treat  their  
employees  with dignity  and respect.  In 2005,  Cummins  
created  a Supplier  Code  of Conduct,  which  it has 
rolled  out to more  than  2,800  suppliers  representing  
nearly  all the Company‚Äôs  supplier  spending.
The Code  spells  out standards  of employee  treatment  
UPXIJDIJUFYQFDUTJUTTVQQMJFSTUPBEIFSFJODMVEJOH
provisions  banning  child  or forced  labor  and those  
which  encourage  suppliers  to provide  a safe workplace  
their employees.
Suppliers  were  asked  to establish  a process  ensuring  
compliance  with the intent  of the code  and to provide  
a means  for workers  to anonymously  report  violations  
without  fear of retribution.  
At the end of 2007,  Cummins  had received  a 99.5  
percent  response  rate,  with 99.6  percent  of those  
responding  indicating  that they  were  in compliance  
with every  element  of the code.  In certain  regions  Yancey  Jones,  a Cummins  new  hire,  meets  with

a substantially  similar  code  that embodies

an audit  of the existing  codes  in place  at all 
our international  joint venture  partners,  and 
will ensure  that such  entities  have  or adopt  
codes  in line with our own.
In 2007,  we developed  a training  package  
to orient  Cummins  employees  who  serve  
as directors  of our joint ventures  to their  
responsibilities.   The training  emphasizes  
the internal  review  processes  that we use 
in selecting  a joint venture  partner.   This 
training  focuses  on the role of the Cummins  
director  in the management  of the joint 
venture  and stresses  the support  available  
to the directors  from  Cummins  specialists  
in the areas  of finance,  human  resources,  
operations,  safety,  environmental  and 
other  functions.   The training  also stresses  
the establishment  and maintenance  of a 
favorable  relationship  with the JV partner  as 
an aid in resolution  of disputes  that arise.   
During  2007,  six training  sessions  were  
conducted  in Indiana,  India,  China  and 
England.   Approximately  100 JV directors,  
general  managers  and financial  leaders  
have been  trained.   The training  will 
continue	in	2008	in	Brazil	and	Central	
Indiana  with an additional  four-to-six  
training  events.
In addition  to this face-to-face  training,  
Cummins  also has launched  a pilot  
program  to deliver  some  of its on-line  
compliance  and ethics  courses  ‚Äì such  as 
courses  on anti-bribery  and export  controls  
‚Äì to employees  of JVs.   This program  
has been  launched  with the joint venture

In 2007,  Internal  Audit  issued  more  than  
130 audit  reports  and audit  memos  
covering  functions  and businesses  around  
the globe.   Internal  Audit  also has a formal  
implementation  plan  follow-up  process  
to ensure  management  has addressed  
identified  risks  and implemented  corrective  
actions.   When  a function  or business  
receives  an ‚ÄúUnacceptable‚Äù  audit  grade,  
the	Business	Unit	leadership 	must	present

Joint  Venture  Relationships
Cummins  does  business  around  the 
world  through  a number  of joint venture  
agreements  and alliances  with business  
partners  to increase  our market  penetration,  
expand  our product  lines,  streamline  our 
supply  chain  management  and develop  
new technologies.   Regardless  of whether  
Cummins  directly  manages  the joint venture  
entity,  we take  appropriate  steps  to ensure  
that the joint ventures  share  our values.
First,  we carefully  screen  potential  partners  
and only create  joint ventures  with partners  
we know  and trust.   Through  our employees‚Äô  
participation 	on	the	Boards	of	these	entities,	
we make  sure  that Cummins  values  are 
embodied  in the joint venture.
We are taking  new  steps  to ensure  that our 
joint venture  entities  treat  their  employees  
in	a	fair	and	equitable	fashion.		By	the	end	
of 2008,  all of our North  American  joint

that a small  number  of engines  manufactured  by a Cummins  joint venture  in China  
had been  sold by our partner  to its truck-making  subsidiary,  which  then  sold the 
trucks  to Sudan.  Cummins  had no knowledge  of the final destination  of those  
engines  and the sale violated  no U.S.  laws.

 .V]LYUHUJLManaging  Travel  Risks  
Cummins  serves  customers  in more  than  
70 countries  and territories,  so global  travel  
is part of many  employees‚Äô  jobs.  Travel  
always  involves  an element  of risk, but in 
today‚Äôs  world  it is especially  important  to 
manage  that risk to the best  of our ability.  
We found  ourselves  working  with 
numerous  travel  agencies  across  the world  
as Cummins‚Äô  business  expanded  globally,  
which  made  data  gathering  and reporting  
difficult.  In 2007,  we moved  to a single,  
global  travel  agency  that could  not only 
measure  up in terms  of economics,  but 
also capability,  systems  and emergency  
reporting.  Cummins  used  Six Sigma  tools   
to develop  the bid package  and sign the 
best agency  for the job. 
A world  map  tool is available  to Cummins  
management,  enabling  the instant  location  
of Cummins  personnel  worldwide.  
Pandemic  Planning  
Over the past  several  years,  reports  of 
avian  flu outbreaks  have  made  headlines  
around  much  of the world.  Much  has 
been  made  about  the consequences  of 
a possible  pandemic  should  the avian  flu 
virus gain  the ability  to easily  spread  via 
human-to-human  contact.  
At Cummins,  the well-being  of our 
employees  is extremely  important.  As 
such,  the Company  has taken  steps  to 
ensure  the health  and safety  of employees  
should  a flu pandemic  occur.  
The Company  formed  a Pandemic  
Planning  Team  with individuals  
representing  medical,  safety,  risk 
management,  human  resources,  facilities,  the Company  bars  transactions  with any 
person  or organization  where  the end 
destination  of a Cummins  product  is 
Sudan	or	Myanmar	(Burma);	or	where	any	
Cummins  product  or service  would  be used  
in a military  application  in Syria,  Libya,   
North  Korea  or Iran.  
Cummins‚Äô  policy  on exports  is 
comprehensive,  but can be summed  up in 
the following  manner:  We will know  which  
countries  are subject  to sanctions.  
We will know  our customers  and business  
partners.  We will know  our products  and be 
aware  of their  export  control  status.  We will 
obtain  necessary  licenses  where  warranted  
and will strictly  follow  their  conditions.  
We believe  our reputation  for ethical  and 
responsible  conduct  is our most  important  
and valuable  asset,  and we encourage  
employees  to raise  compliance  concerns  to 
the highest  levels  of the Company.  
All Cummins  employees  who  complete  the 
Annual  Ethics  Certification  must  certify  their  
compliance  with our most  recent  Export  
Control  Policy.
Crisis  Communications  
Making  sure  that Cummins  is prepared  
if a crisis  occurs  is a key Company  
responsibility.  To assist  facility  managers  
and others  involved  in emergency   
planning,  Cummins  routinely  updates  its 
Crisis  Communications  Plan.  The plan  
includes  vital information  for facilities  on 
how to communicate  effectively  during   
a crisis,  as well as templates  and forms   
to assist  employees  in gathering  and 
updating  information.  
Cummins  also has developed  business  
continuity  plans  for each  business  unit or 
critical  function  within  the business  unit.
‚ÄúEvery  employee  
at Cummins  
should  feel 
valued,  because  
there  is a 
recognition  that  
it takes  all of us 
working  together  
to make  this a 
great  company.‚Äù
Tamica  Wright
32                                     Cummins Inc. 2007 Sustainability ReportIn 2007,  the office  worked  closely  on the energy   
bill with Congress  and other  engine  companies  to 
create  a new  fuel efficiency  program  for medium  
and heavy-duty  trucks.  In addition  to increasing  
Corporate  Average  Fuel Economy  (CAFE)  
standards  for cars,  the legislation  increases  the 
use of renewable  fuels  substantially,  prompting  
the office  to focus  on providing  for the responsible  
growth  of biodiesel,  such  as requiring  labeling  so 
that consumers  know  what  they  are putting  in 
their engines  and ensuring  the adoption  of broad  
quality  standards.   The Washington  office  also 
championed  provisions  that promote  the installation  
of energy  efficiency  technologies,  including  clean  
and efficient  combined  heat  and power  projects,   
at industrial  sites  across  the country.  
Cummins  continued  to collaborate  with a broad  
group  of environmental,  industry  and public  groups  
for funding  of the Diesel  Emissions  Reduction  Act, 
a national  grant  program  to promote  the retrofit  
of older  diesel  engines  with emission  reduction  
technologies.   For the first time  in FY2008,  our 
efforts  successfully  secured  funding  for this 
program  and resulted  in a seven-fold  increase  in 
retrofit  funding  over  the previous  year.   Cummins  
also secured  increased  funding  for Department  
of Energy  research  and development  programs  
that promote  energy  efficiency  in stationary  and 
transportation  applications.communications,  business  continuity  and other  key 
areas  to help  create  a strategic  response  plan  in the 
event  of a pandemic.  
The team  has identified  key components  of the 
Company‚Äôs  response  should  a pandemic  occur.  
Our plans  take  into account  the full range  of our 
stakeholders  ‚Äì employees,  customers,  investors,  
suppliers,  vendors  and the communities  in which  we 
live and work.  A critical  part of successfully  managing  
a situation  such  as this one is providing  open  lines  of 
communication  to those  stakeholders.   Employees  at 
Cummins  receive  regular  updates  on the avian  flu and 
on our efforts  to keep  them  and our facilities  safe.  
Should  a widespread  outbreak  of flu affect   
Cummins  operations,  the Company  is prepared   
to deal  with the issue.  
Government  Relations
In August  2001,  Cummins  opened  an office  in 
Washington,  D.C.  to coordinate  government  relations  
activities  for the corporation.  The Washington  office  
provides  strategic  insight  and advice  to Cummins  
business  leaders  on emerging  government  issues  and 
activities,  provides  top level  access  to government  
officials  and key policymakers,  develops  and 
implements  government  relations  strategies   
to achieve  business  objectives  and advances  business  
marketing  objectives  relative  to government  programs.
The office  elevates  government  issues  to senior  
management,  ensures  alignment  with Cummins  
businesses  and objectives,  and identifies  and 
aggressively  resolves  key government  issues  for 
the corporation.  Specific  areas  of activity  include  
energy  policy,  environment,  tax, trade,  transportation,  
government  research  and development,  government  
markets,  workplace  and human  resources  issues,  
defense  and homeland  security,  and facility  and 
infrastructure  programs.

TVDIBTDBSCPOEJPYJEF$VNNJOTJT
actively  engaged  in creating  solutions  to 
this global  concern.
Why is Cummins  involved  in this?   First  
of all, it is a natural  fit with our mission  
to demand  that everything  we do lead  to 
a cleaner,  healthier,  safer  environment.  
Making  energy  improvements  is good  
business  because  it gives  Cummins  the 
opportunity  to improve  the efficiency  of our 
facilities  and drive  cost  reduction.   It‚Äôs also 
good  for our customers  because  we work  
with them  to get best  fuel economy  out of 
our products.  As part of our continued  commitment  
to sustainable  practices,  Cummins  is 
participating  in the U. S. Environmental  
Protection  Agency‚Äôs  (EPA)  Climate  
Leaders  program.
Launched  in February  2002,  EPA  Climate  
Leaders  is an industry-government  
partnership  that works  to develop  long-term  
comprehensive  corporate  climate  change  
strategies.  Climate  Leaders  Partners  set a 
corporate-wide  greenhouse  gas reduction  
goal,  inventory  their  emissions  to measure  
progress  and report  that data  to the EPA.
As a result  of our involvement,  Cummins  
has pledged  to reduce  its corporate-wide  
greenhouse  gas (GHG)  emissions  intensity  
by 25 percent  by 2010,  against  a base  
year of 2005.  The Company  will track  
greenhouse  gas emissions  at Cummins-
managed  facilities  worldwide.  The GHG  Managing  Carbon  Emissions

reduction  in GHG  intensity  that Cummins  has  
already  achieved.
The Climate  Change  Team
Early in 2007,  Cummins  formed  a Climate  Change  
team  to take  both  a holistic  and tactical  view  of 
climate  change  and sustainability  at Cummins.  The 
team‚Äôs  members  are from  across  business  units  and 
functions  and represent  facilities,  product  planning,  
corporate  strategy,  environmental  policy  and 
government  relationship,  among  others.  
The	team	looks	at	issues	that	range	in	complexity 	
from domestic  and international  energy  policy  and 
fuel economy  standards  to simpler  challenges,  such  
as buildings  best  suited  for occupancy  sensors  and 
daylight  harvesters.  Collaborating  with  Customers
Cummins‚Äô  efforts  to reduce  carbon  intensity  
encompass  both  our products  and our collaborative  
efforts  with customers.  
Engines  
Cummins  has numerous  initiatives  in this area,  with 
key ones  focused  on the management  of automotive  
heavy-duty  engine  idle, cruise  control  and speed.  
Idle management  features  supported  within  the 
Electronic  Control  Modules  (ECMs)  of our engines  
can help  our customers  reduce  fuel consumption  by 
shutting  off the engine  after  a specified  amount  of 
time at idle or allowing  the fleet manager/owner  to 
make	decisions 	about	‚Äúrewarding‚Äù 	drivers	with	slightly	
more	cruise	control	maximum 	set	speed	if	they	have	
minimized  their  idle time.  Customers  can allow  a 
driver  a little more  speed  but retain  a positive  balance  
on fuel saved  ‚Äî and fuel saved  is fuel not burned  
and therefore  less carbon  released.  
35 Environment‚ÄúWe believe  
we can‚Äôt  be 
successful  
unless  we 
focus  on 
working  toward  
a cleaner,  
healthier,  safer  
environment.  
This is a 
core value  at 
Cummins.‚Äù
Peter   
Jensen-MuirPower  Generation  
A typical  long-haul  truck  spends  an  
average  of 2,000  hours  a year  idling  with 
the base  engine  fuel consumption  of one 
gallon  per hour  at idle. A product  developed  
by our Power  Generation  business,  the 
Cummins  ComfortGuard  Auxiliary  Power  
Unit (APU),  mounts  to the frame  of the 
tractor  and can provide  heating  and air 
conditioning  while  using  only about   
0.2 gallons  of fuel per hour.  
In addition,  the APU  can keep  the main  
engine  heated  in cold  ambient  conditions  
so it will start  when  needed.  All of these  
requirements  can be achieved  with the 
APU as an alternative  to running  the main  
engine.  Use of the APU  can reduce  the  
fuel consumption  of a typical  long-haul  
truck  fleet by 1,600  gallons  of diesel  fuel  
per truck  each  year.  
Combined  Heat   
and Power  Applications  
Cogeneration,  or Combined  Heat  and 
Power  (CHP),  is the production  of two  
kinds  of energy  ‚Äì usually  electricity  and  
heat ‚Äì from  a single  source  of fuel. 
Cogeneration  can replace  the traditional  
method  of supplying  energy  from  multiple  
sources,  e.g.,  purchasing  electricity  from  
the power  grid and burning  natural  gas or 
oil separately  in a furnace  to produce  heat  
or steam.  These  methods  can waste  up to 
two-thirds  of the energy  in the original  fuel ‚Äì 
losses  that translate  into high  utility  rates.  The second  aspect  of reducing/managing  
the carbon  risks  involves  our fuel  
economy  features.  We have  a long  list 
of features  within  our ECMs  that are 
specifically  designed  to help  customers  
minimize  the amount  of fuel they  burn.  
Again,  this ultimately  becomes  a means   
of minimizing  carbon.  
Some  of these  features  are: 
Road  Speed  and Cruise  Control  Governor:  
The feature  limits  the maximum  vehicle  
speed  with the driver‚Äôs  foot on and off  
the throttle.  Power  required,  and therefore  
fuel burned,  is directly  proportional  to  
vehicle  speed.  
Smart	Torque:	By	allowing	high	torque	in	 
the top two gears,  you can minimize  the 
number  of down  shifts  required  to maintain  
speed	on	the	highway.	By	avoiding	a	
downshift,  overall  engine  speed  is lowered  
and a lower  engine  speed  generally  
equates  to less fuel burned.  
In addition  to these  ‚Äúactive‚Äù  features,  
Cummins  engines  also have  a number  of 
‚Äúinformation  features‚Äù  where  ‚Äútrip‚Äù  or ‚Äúduty  
cycle‚Äù	information 	is	stored.	By	reviewing	
these  data,  a fleet manager  can look  for 
variations  between  drivers  or trucks,  look  
for trends  and use the data  for driver  
coaching  or to schedule  maintenance.  
Engine  Testing  
Cummins  is working  to reduce  energy  
consumption,  lower  pollution  levels  and 
reduce  costs  through  initiatives  to reduce  
engine  testing  in product  development  
and in manufacturing.  These  initiatives  
encompass  design,  the verification  of 
manufacturing  quality  and the advanced  
diesel  engine  quality  verification  process.

Cummins  seeks  to partner  with groups  that help  us be a better  
steward  of the environment.  
In 2006  and 2007,  we participated  in the Carbon  Disclosure  Project  
(CDP),  an institutional  investor  consortium  that seeks  to encourage  
greater  environmental  reporting  among  companies.  On behalf  of investors  
representing  $31 trillion  in assets  under  management,  CDP  asks  
companies  to provide  details  on their  carbon  emissions,  their  positioning  
in response  to the impact  of climate  change  on their  markets  and

two competitive  advantages.
First,  Cummins  benefits  from  an integrated  
business  structure  that enables  it to tap the 
core competencies  of Cummins  Emission  
Solutions,  Cummins  Turbo  Technologies,  
Cummins  Fuel Systems  and Cummins  
Filtration.  These  businesses  work  together  
to bring  to market  technologically  superior,  
fully integrated  systems.  
Second,  Cummins  has worldwide  
experience 	and	leadership 	with	a	wide	
range  of proven  technologies.  Cummins  
continues 	to	execute	its	carefully	planned	
product  strategy,  anticipating  changes  and 
investing  in the research  and development  
necessary  to meet  customer  needs  and 
environmental  goals.
All Cummins  U. S. on-highway  engines  will 
be fully certified  and compliant  to the near-
zero EPA  2010  emissions  standards.
Controlling  Emissions   
in the Off-Highway  Market
Cummins  captured  the attention  of the  
off-highway  equipment  industry  as the first 
to announce  a technology  path  to meet  
Tier 4 emission  regulations.   The EPA  Tier 4 
Interim	and	equivalent 	European 	Stage	IIIB	
off-highway  emission  standards  take  effect  
across  the 174-hp  to 751-hp  (130-560  kW) 
powerband  in 2011.   
The core  technology  will be Cummins  
Particulate  Filter  and cooled  EGR  system   
as part of an integrated  technology   
solution	extending 	from	air	intake	to	 
exhaust	aftertreatment.
Cummins  is taking  a lead  role in the industry  
because  of its unique  in-house  technology  while  working  in tandem  with the cooled-
EGR subsystem.
The Cummins  Particulate  Filter,  designed  
and manufactured  by Cummins  Emission  
Solutions  and introduced  in 2007,  will be 
the only aftertreatment  required  for Heavy-
Duty engines  in 2010.  The engine  and 
aftertreatment  work  together  to further  
reduce  particulate  emissions.
MidRange  Engine  Evolution
Cummins  will enhance  its MidRange  
on-highway  product  performance  and 
reliability  by adding  Selective  Catalytic  
Reduction 	(SCR)	to	its	existing	product	
to meet  the near-zero  2010  emissions  
standards.  SCR  is the right  technology  
for Cummins  medium-duty  truck,  bus and 
specialty-vehicle  customers  who  want  a 
simple  and proven  solution  to meet  their  
diverse  power  and duty  cycle  needs.
Cummins  MidRange  engines  are known  for 
their	exceptional 	value.	With	the	MidRange 	
engines,	SCR	enables	Cummins 	to	extend	
its	power	range	while	maintaining 	excellent	
fuel economy,  maintenance  intervals  
and overall  low cost  of ownership.  This 
translates  to even  better  value  for MidRange  
customers  in 2010.
SCR technology  uses  a chemical  called  
urea and a catalytic  converter  to significantly  
reduce	NOx	emissions. 	SCR	technology 	is	
not new  to Cummins.  In 2006,  Cummins  
launched  its MidRange  engines  certified  
to the Euro  4 standard  using  SCR  for 
commercial  vehicle  applications  in Europe.
Competitive  Advantages
Across  its entire  lineup  of on-highway  
engines,  Cummins  is able  to meet  
increasingly  stringent  emissions  regulations

SHOT  OF AWARD  COMING
41 Environmentrequired  to be in compliance  with the new  
standard  by January  of 2007.  
By	2010,	all	heavy-duty 	diesel	engines	 
are expected  to meet  the NOx  standard   
of 0.20  grams  per brake-horsepower  hour   
(g/bhp-hr)  and the PM standard  of  
0.01g/bhp-hr.  
Also by 2010,  regulations  will require  the 
phase-in  of advanced  on-board  diagnostics  
with additional  sensors  to monitor  the 
effectiveness  of emission-control  systems  
on the engine,  which  will alert  the driver  if a 
failed  emission-reduction  device  needs  to 
be repaired.  
Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel  Fuel  (ULSD)  
In addition  to the new  exhaust  emission  
standards,  the EPA  is lowering  the limit for 
diesel  sulfur  fuel from  500 parts  per million  
(ppm)  to 15 ppm.  The new  fuel standard  
began  to be phased  in October  2006  and 
will be completed  by September  1, 2010  
(100 percent  participation).  
Cummins  has publicly  expressed  its  
support  of ultra-low  sulfur  fuel. ULSD  
has several  benefits.  It produces  less 
particulate  matter  from  combustion,  so it 
is a particulate  matter  control  strategy  for 
all equipment  in use.  In addition,  ultra-low  
sulfur  fuel enables  the use of advanced  
aftertreatment  control  systems.  
Biodiesel  Fuels  Now  in Use
Biodiesel	is	a	clean-burning 	alternative 	
fuel made  from  renewable  resources  like 
soybeans,  vegetable  oils and even  algae.  
It creates  about  60 percent  less carbon  
dioxide  than  petroleum  fuels,  biodegrades  
as quickly  as sugar,  and is less toxic  than  and system  integration.  Our Tier 4 solution  
is driven  by the need  to deliver  the lowest  
cost of ownership  and most  productive  
power  solutions  for operators.  The 2011  
off-highway  regulations  require  a 90 percent  
reduction  in PM and a 45 percent  reduction  
in NOx  emissions.
While  meeting  these  stringent  reductions,  
Cummins 	Tier	4	QSB	to	QSX	products	will	
offer enhanced  performance  and improved  
fuel efficiency  compared  to our current   
Tier 3 engines.  
Integrating  Tier 4 engine  and aftertreatment  
into a wide  variety  of off-highway  equipment  
types  will be challenging,  but Cummins‚Äô  
application  engineering  expertise  will enable  
us to design  and pre-engineer  all the key 
subsystems  in-house.
For Tier 4, Cummins  will offer  standardized  
engine,  aftertreatment  and air intake  
packages,  speeding  up installation  work  
and realizing  space-saving  advantages  for 
our OEM  customers.  
The 2010  EPA Emissions   
and Fuel  Rule  
Looking  ahead  to 2010,  emission  
requirements  will change  dramatically  for 
heavy-duty 	trucks	over	this	period.	Both	
NOx and PM will be reduced  by 90 percent  
from 2004  levels.  
The EPA  has allowed  for a NOx  phase-in  
from 2007  through  2009.  During  this time,  
50 percent  of the engines  produced  must  
meet  the stricter,  2007  NOx  standard,   
while  50 percent  may  continue  to meet  the 
2004  standard.  
The PM requirement  was not phased  in, 
and, as a result,  all engine  production  was ‚ÄúWe believe  the  
right  technology   
matters  and  
that nobody  is  
better  than  we  
are at creating  
emissions-compliant  
products  that  meet   
our customers‚Äô  
expectations.‚Äù

The Technology  Advantage
Cummins  has long  been  a pioneer  in 
emission  research  and development,  
investing  in critical  technologies  to 
achieve  future  emission  standards  while  
meeting  the needs  of our customers.  The 
Company‚Äôs  emissions  solutions  are the 
result  of a technology  plan  set in motion  
in the early  1990s.  This plan  will carry  
Cummins  through  2010  and beyond.  
At the core  of this road  map  is a strategic  
decision  to develop  the right  technology  
for each  application  and market  served.  
Different  operating  conditions  and factors  
can influence  the technology  path  for 
each  market.  And while  developing  
multiple  emission  solutions  has required  
a significant  investment  in research  and 
development,  the Company  believes  it will 
guarantee  Cummins‚Äô  customers  optimum  
performance  and reliability  at the lowest  
possible  cost  of operation.
More  than  half of the $2.4  billion  spent  by  
Cummins  on research  and development  
in the last 10 years  has been  invested  in 
emission  reduction  technologies.  
Nothing  the Company  does  is more  
important.  Through  our technical

‚ÄúReduce,  reuse,  recycle.‚Äù  That‚Äôs  a key slogan  for environmentalists  
everywhere.  At Cummins,  we have  an additional  term:  ReCon.  ReCon  is the 
name  Cummins  uses  for its line of genuine,  factory-remanufactured  products.  
It takes  about  85 percent  less energy  to remanufacture  a product  than  to 
make  one from  new  parts.  
Reusing  an engine  block,  for example,  saves  energy  at every  step  along  the 
way in mining,  ore processing,  transportation,  casting  and machining.  
Materials  reclaimed  through  ReCon  are estimated  to result  in energy  savings  
sufficient  to power  10,000  homes  in the U. S. Since  most  of that energy  
is fossil-fuel  based,  the savings  also add up to greenhouse  gas (GHG)  
reductions.  Cummins  reuses  or recycles  over  48 million  pounds  of material  
each  year,  with a corresponding  GHG  reduction  of about  200 million  pounds.  
As good  as ReCon  is for the environment,  it also is good  for business.  
The countercyclical  nature  of the remanufactured  parts  business  gives  
Cummins  another  opportunity  to demonstrate  long-term,  stable  earnings  for 
shareholders.  And customers  like the fact that ReCon  effectively  extends  
the life of their  equipment.  Most  ReCon  products  are available  immediately,  
reducing  customer  wait time  for a component  or engine  rebuild.  
Cummins  has had a ReCon  business  in the U. S. since  the 1960s,  but now  is 
locating  world-class  remanufacturing  sites  in India  and China.  As we increase  
our global  ReCon  footprint,  we will increase  revenues  through  remanufacturing  
and add greater  global  diversification  to our portfolio.  It takes  about  
85 percent  
less energy  to 
remanufacture  
an engine  than  
to make  one 
from new parts.

Alberta  GreenEmission  Regulations   
and Cummins  Product  Goals
Since  the 1970s,  Cummins  on-highway  
engines  have  been  regulated  by the EPA  
and similar  regulatory  agencies  around  the 
world  for combustion  emissions,  including  
NOx,  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  hydrocarbons  
(HC) and PM, also known  as soot.  
Cummins  works  closely  with regulatory  
bodies  to seek  aggressive,  but 
technologically  feasible,  emission  reductions  
that also allow  us to continue  to make  
products  that meet  the exacting  needs  of 
our customers.  
When  compared  to emissions  from  
unregulated  engines  ‚Äî i.e. before  EPA  
standards  became  effective  in 1973  ‚Äî 
today‚Äôs  on-highway  diesel  engines  emit   
90 percent  less PM and nearly  90 percent  
less NOx.  Cummins  and other  engine-One part of this strategy  involves  process  
improvement  tools  such  as Six Sigma  
and Analysis-Led  Design  (using  computer  
analysis  and simulation  tools  to optimize  
designs  analytically  and eliminate  expensive  
prototype  testing).  Another  is to involve  
OEMs  and joint venture  partners  as early   
as possible  in the development  and 
integration  process.  
This open  exchange  of information  and 
technology  has been  ‚Äì and will continue  
to be ‚Äì instrumental  in developing  high-
performance  products  that deliver  optimum  
performance  and reliability  at the lowest   
total cost.

in Other  Countries  
Cummins  meets  or exceeds  emission  
regulations  in every  country  that it operates.  
In South  Africa,  where  there  are no 
emission  regulations  for existing  types,  
Cummins  sells  EPA  certified  1998/1999  
engines.  Standards  in South  Africa  
commence  in 2010.  Similarly,  in Taiwan,  
emissions  regulations  require  EPA  1994  
standards,  yet Cummins  sells  EPA  1999  
certified  engines.  In Mexico,  the Company  
sells EPA  2004  certified  engines,  although  
the law requires  EPA  1999  certified  engines.  
Cummins  has worked  closely  with the 
Chinese  government  and OEMs  to 
introduce  ‚Äúgreen  engines‚Äù  to China.  
Cummins  is committed  to bringing  in 
advanced,  low-emission  environmental  
products  to Chinese  customers  on-road  engines,  these  non-road  engines  
release  far less HC and CO into the 
environment  than  the maximum  allowed  
by regulatory  agencies.  Likewise,  NOx  and 
PM actual  emission  levels  are under  the 
applicable  standards.  
Cummins  also participates  in a regulatory  
program	called	Averaging, 	Banking	and	
Trading	(ABT).	This	program	allows	emission	
credits  to be generated  and ‚Äúbanked‚Äù  
by a company  whose  products  generate  
emissions  that are lower  than  the regulated  
level.  These  banked  credits  may  be applied  
to other  engines  whose  emissions  are higher  
than the standard.  However,  some  credits  
are discounted  by a certain  percentage  
depending 	on	engine	type	and	ABT	program	
rules.  As a result  of this discounting  process,  
a portion  of the emissions  credits  go unused  
by the Company,  and are thus  an additional  
benefit  to the environment.  EPA Allowed

 Highlighted  sites  represent  enterprise  registrations
57 Environmentthat facilitates  implementation  of a 
common  health,  safety  and environmental  
management  system  (HSEMS)  when  new  
manufacturing  locations  are commissioned.  
The two systems  have  now  been  
successfully  integrated  at the corporate  
level,  supported  by the development  of 
integrated  audit  protocols.   These  efforts  are 
paving  the way for the future  development  
of a combined  HSEMS  enterprise.
Environmental  Management  System
The Enterprise  EMS  was first registered  by 
an independent  third-party  registrar  in 2004,  
when  a total  of four sites  participated.   In 
2007,  Cummins  recertified  the enterprise  
EMS	for	another	three-year 	period.		By	
the end of 2007,  Cummins  had 42 
manufacturing  facilities  and the corporate  
entity  registered  to the ISO 14001  Standard.  
Auditor  Certification  Program
The program  was launched  to support  
Cummins‚Äô  efforts  to develop  more  
consistently  robust  auditing  capabilities  and 
develop  employee  functional  excellence.   
Audit  trainees  are called  on to participate  
with HSE  Council  leaders  in site audits  that 
are conducted  to support  new  HSEMS  
registrations  and satisfy  Cummins‚Äô  annual  
internal  audit  requirement.   Through  
successful  participation  as a team  member  
in several  audits  and a supervised  event  as 
a lead  auditor,  audit  trainees  themselves  
become  certified  as lead  auditors.   
Not only has this initiative  bolstered  
subject  matter  expertise  and reduced  
Cummins‚Äô  dependence  on contractors,  it 
has substantially  facilitated  the sharing  of 
best practices.  Auditors  observe  first-hand  the effective  practices  in place  at the 
audited  site and bring  a fresh  perspective  
to the auditee  by sharing  their  own  
winning  environmental  management  
strategies.   Lead  auditors  are recognized  
at Cummins  annual  HSE  Awards  
Banquet.		Selected	auditors	with	both	
safety  and environmental  responsibilities  
and expertise  are being  certified  within  
both disciplines  to support  the integration  
of these  systems  and the continued  
development  of a HSEMS.   
Environmental  Objectives   
and Targets
Each  year,  the HSE  Council  sets 
objectives  and targets  for the organization  
to ensure  the continual  improvement  of 
Cummins‚Äô  environmental  performance.  
The business  units  supplement  these  
with initiatives  of special  importance  and 
interest  to their  respective  businesses.   
The Enterprise  EMS  is the mechanism  
for driving  these  improvements,  which  
can take  any form  that supports  the 
Company‚Äôs  efforts  to address  our 
environmental  policy  commitments.    
The	Engine	Business	has	reaped	
significant  environmental  benefits   
from their  focus  on paint  reformulations.    
Also,  all businesses  were  engaged  in 
the work  necessary  to develop  our 
greenhouse  gas emissions  (GHG)  
inventory  and the setting  of an emissions  
reduction  goal  as part of an overall  
objective  to reduce  our carbon  footprint.   
Sites  worldwide  have  completed  
innovative  environmental  projects  ‚Äì 
such as reducing  packaging  waste,  
recycling  solvents  and coolants  and 
capturing  rain water  for re-use.   Recent  
objectives  and targets  have  included  ‚ÄúI am honored  
to work  at

 ,U]PYVUTLU[Manufacturing  Operations
For perspective  on our areas  of 
environmental  focus  at the facility  level,  
a general  description  of the manufacturing  
operations  by business  unit follows.
Cummins  Engine:  Within  the Cummins  
Engine	Business, 	manufacturing 	facilities	
employees  conduct  product  design,  
research  and development,  engine  
manufacturing  and engine  and component  
reconditioning.   Engine  assembly  facilities  
perform  engine  block  and component  
machining,  assembly,  painting,  alkaline  bath  
parts  washing  and engine  performance  
testing.   Product  design  and engine  testing  
are the primary  operations  in the research  
and development  technical  centers  where  
production  processes  are limited.
Engine  testing  is conducted  in  
stationary  test stands  or cells,  where  
product  performance  information  is 
measured  as engines  run at various  
duty cycles.   Test  cells  also are used  for 
certification  testing  to ensure  products  
meet  emissions  requirements.  Rebuild/
reconditioning  facilities  perform  engine  
tear-down  and reassembly,  using  alkaline  
parts  washing  processes.  
Cummins  Components:   
The Components  Group  includes  four 
separate  business  units;  Cummins  
Filtration,  Cummins  Fuel Systems,  
Cummins  Turbo  Technologies  and 
Cummins  Emission  Solutions.   Facility  
operations  primarily  involve  filtration  and 
exhaust  product  design,  research  and 
development,  filter and exhaust  component  
assembly,  and product  distribution  and 
warehousing.   Key operations  conducted  
among  the Components  Group  divisions  improvements  of the tools  and processes  
that support  collection  and reporting  of 
key environmental  performance  indicators,  
auditor  training  and other  functional  
excellence  initiatives.   Addressing  water  
conservation  and emphasis  on pollution  
prevention  opportunities  will continue  to be 
focus  areas  as well.
Cummins  Launches  
Energy  Efficiency  Initiative
To meet  one of our key climate  change  
objectives,  a Cummins  global  Energy  
Efficiency  Team  conducted  energy  
assessments  at the largest  Cummins‚Äô  
sites.  They  identified  more  than  500 
capital  projects  alone  at the first 15 sites  
in the United  States.   Information  from  
these  energy  assessments  was used  to 
set an investment  strategy  and define  an 
improvement  approach  based  on energy-
use categories.   These  categories,  such  
as heating  and cooling,  capturing  waste  
energy  and improved  lighting  are driving  
improvements  in our facilities.   
Grassroots  energy  champions,  working  
with the Energy  Efficiency  Team,  also 
are engaging  employees  to initiate  and 
participate  in energy  conservation  projects.
For example,  at the Consolidated  Diesel  
Company,  Cummins‚Äô  joint venture  in 
Rocky  Mount,  North  Carolina,  a project  
was launched  to reduce  the amount  of 
electricity  used  by the plant‚Äôs  lighting.  As a 
result,  more  than  800 standard  lights  were  
replaced  with fluorescent  T5 fixtures.  This 
led to a reduction  in electrical  costs  of  
40 percent  and a savings  of 2.4 million  
kilowatt  hours  a year.
 
   ‚ÄúWorking  for 
a winning  
organization  
and a  
company  with  
outstanding  
financial  
performance  
like Cummins  
are significant  
factors  in 
keeping  
employee  
morale  high.‚Äù

Waste  Streams
The primary  waste  streams  generated  at Cummins  
manufacturing  facilities  include  waste  paint  and 
associated  materials,  paint  and other  filter media,  
wastewater  sludge  and filter cake,  machine  coolant,  
used  oil and resins.   Metals  and metal  parts  that 
cannot  be reconditioned  for re-use  in Cummins  
products  are salvaged  for off-site  recycling,  as are 
used  oils.  Other  waste  streams  include  filter media  
and resins.   At most  facilities,  machine  coolant  is 
recycled  until ineffective  and ultimately  added  to the 
wastewater  stream  for pretreatment  prior  to discharge  
to public  treatment  works.  Environmental  Performance  Measures
Reporting  Sites
Cummins  has collected  key environmental  
sustainability  measures  from  our facilities  for  
many  years,  focusing  on operations  with the  
greatest  potential  environmental  impact.    
Performance  measures  were  originally  gathered   
and reported  internally  in an effort  to identify  
environmental  performance  improvement  
opportunities.   Data  has subsequently  been  
aggregated  for inclusion  in Cummins‚Äô   
Sustainability  Report  and other  reporting  initiatives.
Because	of	Cummins‚Äô 	participation 	in	the	EPA‚Äôs	
Climate  Leaders  Program  and its comprehensive  
GHG  inventory  scope  requirements,  the number   
of sites  taking  part in data  gathering  has broadened  
significantly.   In 2008,  all of Cummins-controlled  
sites worldwide  will provide  data  for all applicable  
sustainability  indicators  irrespective  of facility  size 
and operational  scope.   For the purposes  of this 
report,  performance  data  have  been  compiled  from  
two different  data  sets,  which  are indicated  in the 
following  sections  of this report.
The full complement  of sustainability  metrics,  
including  water  use,  recycled  materials,  
commodities  consumed  and wastes,  as well 
as fuels  and electrical  power  usage  and their  
associated  direct  and indirect  emissions  included  
herein  were  derived  from  manufacturing  and large  
non-manufacturing  sites.   These  include  several  
large  joint venture  facilities  that are not under  
Cummins‚Äô  operational  control.  Fuels,  electricity  and 
other  GHG  sources  and emissions  were  collected  
from all facilities,  irrespective  of size or function,  
where  Cummins  maintains  operational  control  and 
therefore  are in scope  of our Climate  Leaders  GHG  
reduction  commitment.   The 2007  population  of 
sites in scope  of Climate  Leaders  is 233 facilities.   
Greenhouse  gas and other  fuel/energy  related  
emissions  from  Cummins‚Äô  unconsolidated  joint 
venture  businesses  are not included  in this report.

Cummins‚Äô  materials  data  collection  includes  process  
compounds  commonly  used  in the Company‚Äôs  
manufacturing  processes.   In addition,  quarterly  
data is reported  and compiled  for wastes,  recycled  
materials,  utilities  and other  key measures.   
Cummins  has increased  the population  of facilities  
reporting  sustainability  metrics  substantially  over  
the last several  years.   The population  of reporting  
sites in 2006  represents  essentially  all of the most  
significant  manufacturing  and non-manufacturing  
operations  in the company.   In 2008  and beyond,   
all controlled  sites  will systematically  report  all 
metrics,  which  will simplify  data  trend  analysis.   
An additional  16 facilities  reported  data  in 2006  
versus  2005.   The substantially  larger  data  set, 
better  measurement  processes  and continued  
company  growth  are collectively  responsible  for 
the increases  for all metrics  in 2006.   Reductions  in 
diesel	and	natural	gas	were	experienced 	in	2007	as	compared  to the prior  year,  as well as for oil,  
paint  and coolant.   These  measures  are likely  due  
in part to reduction  in engine  production  volumes   
over the same  timeframe.   Natural  gas use is tied 
closely	to	weather	and	may	be	in	part	explained 	due	 
to overall  milder  winter  temperatures  in the regions   
in which  Cummins  operates.   Increases  in quantities   
of recycled  materials  generally  reflect  improvements   
in supporting  processes  worldwide.   
Totals  for recycled  paper,  plastic  and wood  are 
understated  because  at several  locations  load  weights  
are unavailable.   Significant  discharges  to water  also 
are estimated  because  these  are not directly  measured  
at all worldwide  locations.
Re-used  liquid  wastes  represent  estimated  quantities  
of industrial  process  wastes  reclaimed  for re-use  or 
otherwise  returned  to process  as feedstock  in cement  
kilns or blended  fuels.   These  include  oil, coolants,  
solvents  and thinners  and residual  fluids  primarily  from  
painting  processes.Data for NOx,  CO, PM and CO2 for 2005  and 2006  were  developed  from  the 229 sites  reporting  fuels  and electricity   
for the GHG  inventory.   Totals  for VOC  for these  same  years  are based  on data  from  the manufacturing  and larger   
non-manufacturing  sites,  of which,  38 reported  in 2005  and 53 in 2006.   
Emissions  from  diesel  fuel used  in product  testing  applications  and No. 2 fuel oil, propane  and natural  gas used  in boilers   
and furnaces  were  derived  using  EPA  AP-42  Compilation  of Air Pollutant  Emission  Factors,  1996.  
AP-42  emissions  conversions  used  for large  diesel  engines  are based  on obsolete  technology,  so emissions  data  is overstated.Other  Significant  Direct  Air Emissions

In 1995,  Cummins  implemented  a policy  that 
stationary  equipment  using  chlorofluorocarbons  
(CFCs)  would  no longer  be purchased  by 
Cummins.   Equipment  already  in place  would  
be considered  for conversion  or replacement  
depending  on its age and repair  costs.   As a result  
of this policy,  Cummins  has replaced  an estimated  
60 percent  of its equipment  containing  ozone-
depleting  substances.

Cummins  has also been  identified  as a 
PRP at 17 waste  disposal  sites  under  
federal  and state  environmental  statutes,  
three  of which  we expect  could  result  
in expenditures  in excess  of $100,000  
or more  based  upon  our estimated  
proportional  volume  of waste  disposed  at 
these  sites.   
These  sites  and our estimated  exposure  
are as follows:  the Operating  Industries,  
Inc. Site in Monterey  Park,  California  
($211,000),  the Casmalia  Site in Santa  
Barbara,	California	($150,000) 	and	the

Cummins  Filtration‚Äôs  Fleetguard  user-friendly  line of fuel and oil filters  as 
the top Technical  Achievement  for 2006.
Among  an impressive  group  of finalists,  the Fleetguard  user-friendly

achievement  award.  The selection  committee  said the Fleetguard  filter  
was	‚Äúa	shining	example	that	innovation 	is	everywhere.‚Äù
Other  awards  received  by Cummins  Filtration  for the user-friendly  filters  
are Equipment  World‚Äôs  Top 5 Most  Innovative  Products,  Heavy  Duty  
Trucking‚Äôs  Nifty  Fifty Award  and Construction  News‚Äô  Top 100 Award.
The filter has significantly  less environmental  impact  than  a steel  filter;  
requiring  a third  less in material  cost  and presenting  unprecedented  design  
serviceability 	for	customers, 	including	ribbed	‚Äúgrips‚Äù	for	easy	installation.
In 2007,  Cummins  replaced  650,000  filters  with user-friendly  filters,   
saving  350 gallons  of paint  annually  and an associated  reduction  in  
volatile  organic  compounds  emissions  (VOCs)  of 1,250  pounds.
In addition,  the reformulated  paper  filter media  for this product  line, with

and significantly  better  than  our industry  
average.  We had 30 sites  go the entire  
year without  a single  reportable  incident.  
Likewise,  a severity  rate of 0.58  was below  
the target  of 1.0, while  lost work  days  rate 
was just a bit above  target.
These  are positive  signs  that Cummins  
takes  this issue  seriously  and is doing  many  
of the right  things.  Still, we had too many  
NBKPSTBGFUZJODJEFOUTJOoJODMVEJOH
two deaths  and a serious  injury  late in the 
year.  Even  a single  major  safety  incident  is 
one too many,  and obviously  a work-related  
death  in our facilities  is simply  intolerable.  
The majority  of those  incidents  can be 
directly  traced  to a lack of standard  operating  procedures  in facilities  or failure  
to enforce  safety  procedures,  followed  by 
workers  being  injured  as a result  of poor  
quality  equipment.
The most  severe  injuries  have  occurred  
when  workers  were  performing  non-routine  
work  on manufacturing  equipment  without  
first following  the necessary  Lock  Out,  Tag 
Out procedures.  Additionally,  analysis  has 
shown  that contract  workers  in our facilities  
are less informed  and less trained  on our 
safety  practices,  resulting  in a greater  risk of 
injury  to those  workers.
In addition  to some  specific  actions  aimed  at 
improving  safety  in our China  facilities,  which  
suffered  two fatalities  late in 2007,  Cummins  
will be implementing  a number  of actions  
and process  changes  across  the Company.  
These  changes  are aimed  at better  
educating  our employees  on key safety  
practices,  identifying  and implementing  best  Providing  a Safe  Working  Environment

Our goal  is to make  Cummins  a best-in-class  
company  when  it comes  to safety.
Safety  Management  System  
The Cummins  Safety  System  is one way Cummins  
can ensure  safety  programs  like those  mentioned  
above  become  ingrained  as a way of working,  
managing  and operating  at Cummins.   Cummins  
Safety  System  is based  on the Occupational  Health  
and Safety  Assessment  Series  (OHSAS)  18001  
specification,  an international  occupational  health  
and safety  management  system.  The purpose  of the 
specification  is to enable  the organization  to control  
its occupational  health  and safety  risks  and improve  
its safety  performance.  Registration  of the Corporate  
 :HML[`system  performance  has been  maintained  
or improved.  
Safety  and Environmental  Awards
In order  to recognize  outstanding  
performance,  the Health,  Safety  and 
Environmental  Council  presents  awards  
to those  Cummins  entities  that best  
demonstrated  excellence  in one or both  of 
these  areas.  Through  their  efforts,  these  
sites are instrumental  in helping  Cummins  
meet  the commitments  of the Company‚Äôs  
Vision  and Mission.   The Council  
evaluated  the performance  of each  entity,  
using  the following  criteria:  
‚Ä¢	Benefit	to	environment 	and	safety
‚Ä¢	Level	of	management 	 
and employee  commitment
‚Ä¢	Economic 	efficiency
‚Ä¢	Innovation
‚Ä¢	Ability	to	serve	as	a	model	for	use

The environmental  awards  focus  on 
projects  and initiatives  that promote  
sustainability,  emissions  reductions  and 
the conservation  of natural  resources.   
Bonus	points	are	awarded	for	site	
recognition  in government  and non-
governmental  organizations‚Äô  environmental  
stewardship  programs.  
Entities  are recognized  at four distinct  
levels;	Chairman, 	Business	Unit/HSE	
Council,	Director	and	Best	Practice.	
The HSE  Council  also honored  several  
individuals,  including  facility  HSE  leaders  
and plant  managers,  for their  personal  
commitment  and efforts  to improve  safety  
and environmental  performance.  and three  site systems  meeting  the OHSAS  
18001  specification  was completed  in 2007,  
with aggressive  growth  planned  in 2008.

Cummins  Safety  System  
(CSS Audits)  
The CSS  Audit  is based  on the 10 Cummins  
Operating  System  statements,  and defines  
within  its eight  criteria  statements  the 
minimum  safety  requirements  for the 
Company.  Audit  scores  enable  Cummins  
facilities  globally  to benchmark  themselves  
against  each  other  and against  the 
Company‚Äôs  standards.  Sites  whose  previous  
year performance  did not meet  the Incidence  
Rate (iR) and SLWR  targets  are required  to 
participate  in the CSS  Audit  program.  
CSS Audits  are conducted  in three  phases:  
Pre-Audit:  A pre-audit  is performed  to 
identify  the gaps  between  current  site 
practices  and the system  requirements.  
The pre-audit  is conducted  three  to six 
months  before  the formal  audit.  
Formal  Audit:   A formal  audit  is conducted  
with the participation  of corporate  lead  
auditors,  to determine  level  of conformance  
to CSS  criteria.  The site must  have  
participated  at least  in the formal  audit  stage  
to be eligible  for the Company‚Äôs  internal  
Health  and Safety  recognition  program.  
Verification  Audit:  A verification  audit   
is performed  following  the formal  audit   
when  the site needs  to demonstrate  safety  ‚ÄúThe  safety  and 
well-being  of our 
employees  is a

At Cummins  ‚Äî which  does  business  around  the

From  a business  perspective,  the Company  believes  
that successfully  managing  diversity  strengthens  
relationships  with an increasingly  diverse  customer  
base.	Beyond	that,	a	diverse	work	force	‚Äì	in	terms	
of	race,	ethnicity,	age,	gender,	sexual	orientation 	
and	educational 	background 	‚Äì	ensures	a	variety

include  the following:
 
‚Ä¢	All	employees 	complete	a	comprehensive 	
diversity	training	program	designed	exclusively 	for	
Cummins.  Second  generation  (advanced  diversity  
management  topics)  training  is a mandatory  part 
of career  development  for leaders.  ‚Ä¢	In	all,	48	Local	Diversity	Councils	(LDCs)	have	
been  created  to address  diversity  issues  in  
the communities  in which  Cummins  does  
business.  In addition,  the LDCs  focus  on 
recruiting,  retention  and cultural  differences  in  
the workplace.  Affinity  groups,  or employee  
resource  groups,  have  been  instrumental  in 
Cummins‚Äô  diversity  journey.  Currently,  we have  
affinity  groups  for African  and African-  Americans,  
Asians,  Chinese,  Latino,  new  hires  and lesbian,  
gay,	bisexual	and	transgender 	employees.
‚Ä¢	Cummins‚Äô 	long-standing 	commitment 	to	use	
qualified  minority-owned  suppliers  has yielded  
good  results  in recent  years.  In 2006,  Cummins  
spent  $298.8  million  with small  business  and

different  backgrounds.  The second  is 
creating  an environment  that manages  
people‚Äôs  differences  effectively  and,  in  
doing  so, inspires  innovative  ideas  and

The Company  relies  on the insight

Diversity  provides  Cummins  with a 
competitive  advantage  in the following  areas:  
New markets  and new  businesses:

currently  are growing  faster  than  in the U.S.  
Nearly  all world  growth  to 2050  is projected  
to occur  in Africa,  Asia  and Latin  America.  
The best  way to grow  into new  businesses  
and more  geographic  regions  is to have  
employees  who  understand  the culture  or 
are part of it. 
Customer  requirements:  Purchasing  
materials  and services  from  a diverse  supply

At Cummins,  corporate  responsibility  has three  major  
areas  of focus:  community  involvement,  corporate  
donations  and the Cummins  Foundation.  When  special  
needs  arise,  Cummins  has several  avenues  through  
which  to provide  assistance.  
Community  Involvement  Teams  
Community  Involvement  Teams  (CITs)  are employee-led  
committees  that represent  the diversity  of the workforce  
and all levels  of management.  They  are driven  by the 
philosophy  that a company  cannot  function  without  a 
healthy  community.  Each  year,  Cummins  Mechelen  (Belgium)  holds  a breakfast  in 
support  of a Rwandan  orphanage  to help  purchase  uniforms,  
pencils  and other  school  equipment  for the children,  ages   
6 to 14. Some  600 orphans  attend  the school,  and their  
education  costs  about  $30 Euros  (US $41)  per year  per student.
93 Corporate ResponsibilityIn response  to the needs,  the local  
Corporate  Social  Responsibility  (CSR)  
committee  worked  tirelessly  to provide  
short-term  housing,  food  and support.  
Additionally,  the national  CSR  team   
initiated  the ‚ÄúOne  Family‚Äù  flood  relief  
fundraising  campaign  for reconstruction  
of local  employee  homes  and shared  
community  infrastructure.  
Corporate  Donations  
Donations  provide  a means  for Cummins  
to participate  in community  events  
that are more  appropriately  funded  by 
the Company  than  the Foundation.  
These  activities  include  memberships,  
sponsorships,  dinners  or other  events.  
Cummins  made  approximately  $2.9  
million  in corporate  donations  to charitable  
causes  in 2006  and $3.4  million  in 2007.  
The Cummins  Foundation  
The Cummins  Foundation  is one of the 
oldest  corporate  charitable  foundations  in 
the United  States.  The Foundation  serves  
to improve  the communities  in which  
Cummins  does  business  by providing  the 
tools and means  for people  living  on the 
edge  of society  to overcome  the barriers  
they face.  The Foundation‚Äôs  President  
serves  as Cummins‚Äô  Executive  Director  of 
Corporate  Social  Responsibility,  providing  
leadership  and coordination  to all the 
Company‚Äôs  social  work.  Cummins  also 
has formed  foundations  in Mexico  and 
India over  the last decade.  
The Foundation  focuses  on embracing  the 
diverse  perspectives  of all people,  seeking  
innovative  ways  to address  societal  
needs  by emphasizing  partnerships  and development  of skills  among  people   
who live in Colonia  Satellite  and 
surrounding  areas.
 More  than  190 students  are benefiting  
from elementary  and high  school  classes  
at this Centre.  English,  computing,

the	Belgian	organization 	Les	Enfants	du	
P√®re Martin  to collect  $2,500  in support  
of an orphanage  in Rwanda  where  
children  ages  6 to 14 attend  primary  
school  classes.  The support  goes  toward  
the purchase  of uniforms  that are made  
locally,  as well as school  books,  pencils  
and other  school  equipment.  Some  600 
orphans  attend  the school.
‚Ä¢	During	2006	and	2007,	the	Darlington 	
Engine  Plant  (DEP)  supported  Action  for 
Blind	People	(AFBP),	a	national	charity.	
Employees‚Äô  efforts  included  both  fund  
raising,  as well as direct  employee  
engagement.  DEP  volunteers  have  been  
instrumental 	in	helping	AFPB	develop	
an Actionaires  Club  that gives  visually  
impaired  children  ‚Äì between  the ages  of 
4 and 16 ‚Äì the opportunity  to participate  
in different  sports  and leisure  activities.
‚Ä¢	In	late	July	2007,	torrential	rains,	lightning	
strikes  and mudflows  battered  cities  in 
central  and southern  China,  resulting  
in the worst  flooding  in more  than  
100 years.  More  than  1 million  people  
were  left homeless.  The rains  left the 
Chongqing  Cummins  (CCEC)  plant  and 
the homes  of many  local  employees  
water-soaked  and covered  with mud.‚ÄúSix Sigma  is an 
indispensable  
improvement  
methodology  
and toolset  at 
Cummins  that  
has permanently  
changed  the 
culture.‚Äù
