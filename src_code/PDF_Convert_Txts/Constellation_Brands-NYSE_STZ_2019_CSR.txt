2019 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT2
 3Constellation Brands has been committed to building our 
business in an ethical and responsible manner since our 
founding more than 70 years ago. Our corporate social 
responsibility efforts follow two guiding principles: we 
operate our business responsibly and sustainably; and 
we work to make a positive and meaningful impact in 
our communities. These commitments are shared by our 
talented Constellation Brands employees who live and  
work in communities across the United States, Mexico,  
New Zealand, and Italy. 
MANAGING OUR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY  
AND SUSTAINABLY  
 
We are committed to serving as good stewards of the 
environment by ensuring that our facilities operate 
sustainably and by putting measures in place to help 
safeguard precious natural resources. 
Water Stewardship  
Constellation Brands is committed to ensuring the efficient 
use of water at all our facilities. For instance, over the 
past three years our facility in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico, has 
reduced the intensity of water consumed  in our brewery 
production process by 15% liters of water per liter of beer 
produced. In addition, this facility has an on-site wastewater 
treatment operation that allows us to reuse 35% of water 
used as part of our brewery production process. 
In addition to ensuring the efficient use of water at each  
of our facilities, we also support a number of organizations 
focused on water preservation. For example, through 
our Pacifico Preserves program, we actively support 
organizations such as American Whitewater (which 
conserves and restores whitewater resources),  RESPONSIBLE

helps conserve marine resources and coastal environments). 
Our Napa Valley Vineyard Operations team collaborates with the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the Napa County Flood Control 
Agency and other partners on a nine-mile Napa River Restoration 
project that benefits wildlife, promotes biodiversity, increases 
water quality within the restoration zone, and improves  
flood control.  
Furthermore, Constellation Brands serves as a signatory of the 
Business Alliance for Water and Climate, which brings together 
private sector companies to collaborate in solving water-related 
issues and implementing strategies that reduce water-related 
risks, including companies’ operational impacts on water 
throughout the value chain.1112185 4
Energy Efficiency  
Our facilities also embrace efforts to conserve energy. We 
continuously monitor our carbon footprint and have worked to 
effectively reduce emissions per liter of product produced. We are 
part of a solar initiative that includes approximately 17,000 solar 
panels spanning four wineries—one of the largest solar footprints 
in the U.S. wine industry—and in fiscal 2018, we generated  
5.5 million kWh of solar energy.
Waste Reduction  
Across the company, we engage in a variety of activities to reduce 
waste, including composting, recycling, and diverting materials. 
For instance, our Ruffino winery operations in Italy and our Nava 
brewery in Mexico respectively diverted 92% and 99% of waste 
produced at these facilities in fiscal 2018. 
Responsible Advertising / Consumption  
In addition to our efforts to serve as good stewards of our 
environment, we also have a long-standing commitment to 
promoting, advertising, and marketing responsible use of our 
products, in accordance with industry best practices. Our Global 
Code of Responsible Practices for Beverage Alcohol Advertising 
and Marketing provides the fundamental framework for 
responsible brand advertising and marketing that ensures our 
messages are directed at legal, drinking-age consumers.
We also initiate programs to educate consumers about responsible 
consumption. For instance, during Alcohol Awareness month in 
April and during the December holidays, our brands use social 
media campaigns to reinforce to consumers the importance of 
responsible drinking. In Italy, our Ruffino Winery developed the 
Ruffino Cares program which hosts informational sessions to 
provide consumers with information about responsible drinking.

FISAC Foundation (a social research foundation that promotes 
educational awareness and responsible consumption of alcoholic 
beverages in Mexico) to help educate students about the risks  
of underage drinking.
As members of industry associations such as the Distilled Spirits 
Council, The Wine Institute and The Beer Institute, we collaborate 
with beverage alcohol peers and various business partners across 
beer, wine and spirits to eliminate drunk driving and underage 
drinking. For more than a decade, Constellation has supported 
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s “We Don’t Serve Teens” 
campaign, aimed at preventing underage drinking in markets 
across the U.S.
We empower—and expect—our employees to act as ambassadors 
of responsible consumption and provide resources such as our 
Alcohol Responsibility: Our Shared Commitment program (which 
teaches employees how to promote responsible consumption, 
how to recognize signs of impairment, and steps they can take to 
help ensure the safety and well-being of others) and our Safe Ride 
Home program (in which the company encourages responsible 
consumption by offering to cover the cost of public transportation 
and ride sharing options when employees consume beverage 
alcohol products socially).139 1387 6

Constellation’s founder, Marvin Sands, made giving back to 
our communities an integral part of our values from the very 
beginning, and what truly brings to life our commitment to giving 
back is the passion shown by our employees.
Supporting the Advancement of Women  
We are committed to supporting the advancement of women, 
in our company, in our industry, and in our communities. Our 
internal Women’s Leadership Development Program is designed 
to provide mentoring, exposure and developmental opportunities 
to up-and-coming female leaders within our company.  
In 2018, we launched our Focus on Female Founders program, 
in which the company committed to invest $100 million over the 
next 10 years in female-founded or female-led start-ups in the 
beverage alcohol space. 
In addition, Constellation Brands serves as a lead sponsor 
of Women of the Vine & Spirits, an organization dedicated to 
empowering and advancing women in the beverage alcohol 
industry worldwide.
And we also support organizations such as Dress for Success, 
which seeks to empower women to achieve economic 
independence by providing a network of support, professional 
attire, and developmental tools needed to help women thrive  
in work and life.Creating an Inclusive Environment  
We are committed to creating a safe, welcoming and inclusive 
environment within our company and in our local communities.  
We have taken steps to ensure our workforce better reflects the 
communities and consumers we serve, and to create a workplace 
where all employees feel they can reach their highest potential.  
In 2018, we appointed Kris Carey as our Chief Diversity Officer, 
and have since established a number of Business Resource 
Groups designed to support various employee populations at 
Constellation, including early career professionals, women,  
and employees of Hispanic / Latino descent, and LGBTQ 
employees. Each of these Business Resource Groups focuses  
on various forms of community and civic engagement aligned  
with their mission.

V Foundation for Cancer Research  
Hoops for Hope, the annual Corona-led campaign in support  
of the V Foundation, continues to have a huge impact. Along with 
our distributors, we raised more than $1.4 million for cancer 
research in 2018, achieving another record-breaking fundraising 
year. This joint effort, started in 2010, has now contributed a total 
of $15 million in support of the V Foundation.
Nourishing Neighbors  
Our Nourishing Neighbors initiative supports local efforts in 
communities around the world in the fight against hunger.  
Approximately 1,000 employees across the globe donated their 
time, funds and thousands of pounds of food.Employee Matching Gift Program  
Through Constellation’s Employee Match Program, the company 
matches employee contributions to eligible 501c3 organizations up 
to $5,000 per year. This allows employees to contribute to causes 
they are most passionate about in their respective communities, 
while doubling their impact. To promote participation in the 
program, we dedicate a single day each year for all employees  
to donate in unison.
Between employee donations, company match programs, 
and special incentives, our Employee Match Program raised 
nearly $1.9 million and supported more than 450 not-for-profit 
organizations during 2018.10
