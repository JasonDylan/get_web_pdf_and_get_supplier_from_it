dedication to our clients, communities and one another guided us through 
2020, a challenging year on numerous fronts. Now, that same focus guides us 
forward. We’re revitalizing our commitments and creating a brighter future

A LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN & CEO
 
 
As I look back on 2020, my thoughts immediately turn to the people who suffered and experienced loss due  
to COVID-19 and the millions of first responders and essential workers who worked on the front lines to get us 
through the toughest of times. I’m also reminded of the senseless acts of racism and bigotry that persisted 
throughout the year, prompting outrage and anguish around the world. 
It’s been a uniquely challenging year for Omnicom, and it has certainly impacted us all both personally and 
professionally. It’s been the most difficult year in Omnicom’s 35-year history, and yet, our extraordinary and diverse 
teams across the globe demonstrated unparalleled levels of dedication, creativity, innovation and professionalism 
as they overcame obstacles to support our clients and one another, as well as gave back to their communities. 
While our people have always been the bedrock of our company’s resilience and success, it was never truer than  
in 2020. As we begin to turn the corner and are now on a clear path to growth, I believe Omnicom, our people and 
our agencies will emerge stronger than ever. 
In this report, we share details about our response to the COVID-19 and cultural crises, as well as the other actions we took to create a positive and lasting impact on the world. 
Through these stories, we demonstrate how we’re promoting responsible practices, cultivating an inclusive workplace and making constructive contributions to society.
In 2020, we strived to not only continue our corporate responsibility efforts, but to build on them to further enhance our dynamic and diverse 
workforce, support our communities, manage our environmental footprint and ensure a strong governance structure.
During the past year, we heightened our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), which has long been a part of our core values. The racism and violence against diverse 
communities that we witnessed in 2020 prompted us to ask, “Are we doing enough?” And the short answer was, “No.” 
LETTER      ABOUT OMNICOM     PEOPLE     COMMUNITY     ENVIRONMENT     GOVERNANCE     ABOUT THIS REPORT     UNGC COMMUNICATION     GRI 4While we’ve certainly made progress over the years, we realized we needed to reinforce our commitment to meaningful action. We responded in 2020 by creating OPEN 2.0, 
an action plan designed to help us achieve our ultimate goal: systemic equity throughout Omnicom. As part of the effort, all of our networks and practice areas now have  
a dedicated DE&I leader reporting to their CEO, and we’ve committed to strengthening our existing support of programs dedicated to increasing diversity within the industry. 
You can find more details on OPEN 2.0 on Pages 15-16.
We also continued to advance our employee resource groups (ERGs) in 2020, representing the ability of our people to build connection even in a virtual environment. 
Omniwomen, dedicated to growing the number and influence of Omnicom women leaders, expanded to more than 15 chapters globally. OPEN DisAbility continued  
its important efforts to improve inclusion, visibility and awareness of issues affecting individuals with disabilities or long-term illnesses. And OPEN Pride, focused  
on Omnicom’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQIA+) employees and allies, grew to 12 chapters. 
Omnicom also received a perfect score for the fifth consecutive year on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index (CEI), designating us as a 
2021 Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality. Forbes also named us to its World’s Best Employers 2020 list and its ranking of America’s Best Employers for Diversity.
In a year like no other, we made several other significant commitments that will help define our culture for years to come. They include joining the Civic Alliance —  
a nonpartisan group of businesses working together to build a future where everyone participates in shaping the United States — and giving all our U.S. employees paid 
time off on Election Day to vote and/or volunteer at the polls. We also recognized June 19, or Juneteenth, as a company wide holiday in the U.S. and will do so every year 
moving forward.
While the pandemic kept us away from our offices and prevented business travel in 2020, we remained committed to minimizing the environmental impact of our global 
operations. We activated our Supplier Code of Conduct, requiring all members of our supply chain to endorse our values by operating ethically and responsibly, with 
integrity, honesty and transparency. And we also continued offering mandatory business ethics training to all Omnicom employees.
Our actions demonstrate not only our support for the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact, but our unwavering commitment to be a company that’s 
dedicated to the people we employ, the customers we serve, the shareholders who invest in us and the communities we call home. In this report, I am pleased to share 
our CR activities and progress, and I remain committed to furthering our efforts in the years to come.

RECOGNIZING THE HARDSHIPS OF 2020
This past year was incredibly difficult for so many people in 
our communities around the world. This report is dedicated 
to all those who experienced loss and strife in 2020, who 
selflessly supported their neighbors in times of need and who 
worked tirelessly on the front lines of the pandemic to provide 
critical care. 
10 LETTER     ABOUT OMNICOM      PEOPLE     COMMUNITY     ENVIRONMENT     GOVERNANCE     ABOUT THIS REPORT     UNGC COMMUNICATION     GRI 10The humanity that underpins our business was poignantly expressed  
in 2020. We would be nothing without the bold ideas, limitless passion  
and strong dedication of our people. In a year that tested the resiliency  
of people all over the world, we moved quickly to meet the needs of  
our agencies and their staffs, from technology adaptation to health and 
wellness support. But it was our people — and their courage, honesty, 
creativity and determination — who pushed us forward and stepped up for 
their clients, and one another, as the world around us changed so rapidly.
PEOPLEFostering diverse and inclusive workplaces where every person 
feels comfortable, confident and supported has been an ongoing 
mission at Omnicom. We are a people business. We depend on 
diverse perspectives to help our clients think outside the box and 
meaningfully connect to their audiences.
However, the tragic acts of racism and violence against diverse 
communities in 2020, and the social unrest that followed, prompted  
us to take a closer look at our diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) 
efforts and confront the areas that demanded a greater focus.  
This led us to refine our practices, implement new initiatives,  
and increase transparency and accountability in diversifying our 
workforce and fostering inclusion. We reported some of this in  
our 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report (see Pages 10 and 22),  
and we expand on this important topic in the following pages.

LETTER     ABOUT OMNICOM     PEOPLE      COMMUNITY     ENVIRONMENT     GOVERNANCE     ABOUT THIS REPORT     UNGC COMMUNICATION     GRIOUR RENEWED DE&I APPROACH
To ensure our commitments are propelled not just by goals, but by actions and results as well, we approach all DE&I  
efforts through the lens of these key principles:  
LEADERSHIP 
  Our Board of Directors and senior management work closely with the OPEN Leadership Team,  
which is led by Omnicom’s Chief Equity and Impact Officer and includes DE&I Champions from across our agencies  
and networks. The Team provides structure, support, counsel and visibility to DE&I initiatives and policies throughout  
our organization as we move toward our ultimate goal of systemic equity throughout Omnicom. 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
  Every Omnicom agency is required to determine specific actions, with deadlines,  
to advance DE&I. Executive compensation at Omnicom and its agencies are determined, in part, on  
key performance indicators (KPIs). 
TRANSPARENCY 
  While we have been reporting and disclosing five-year progress on DE&I metrics for  
years, we provided additional disclosures of Omnicom’s workforce diversity in the U.S. in our 2019 Corporate  
Responsibility Report, released in the fall of 2020. We are committed to building on these and furthering  
transparency in the future.

In 2020, we took the time to reflect on our efforts thus far, identify our shortcomings and commit to further progress.  
Born out of this evaluation, OPEN 2.0 is our action plan for achieving systemic equity throughout Omnicom. Our mission  
is to attain equal representation, development, support and retention of marginalized groups, and, in particular in the  
U.S., for Black, Hispanic, Asian and Indigenous professionals and all people of color.  
OPEN 2.0 specifies eight action items that are currently underway and helping us achieve systemic equity faster and  
more effectively. This action plan will maintain our energy and focus for years to come and help ensure our colleagues  
feel seen and supported within all Omnicom agencies. Initiatives for the following eight action items are shared  
throughout this report, with more to come in future reports:   
EXPAND THE OPEN LEADERSHIP TEAM 
  
 -We have expanded, supported and empowered key individuals responsible for our the implementation of this plan.
 -Designate a diversity director to report directly to the CEOs of each network and practice area. This includes  
at the corporate level, with Omnicom Group’s Chief Equity and Impact Officer, Emily Graham, reporting to  
Chairman and CEO John Wren.
ATTRACT AND RECRUIT TALENT 
  
 -Our agencies will work with the OPEN Leadership Team to promote our DE&I programs and initiatives  
and establish themselves as the best workplaces to belong.
DEVELOPMENT 
  
 -Establish the Talent Advocacy Program, which will pair an individual with a mentor in a position  
of influence who can advocate for the individual’s success and advancement.1

CLIENTS 
 -Establish a Client DE&I Communications Program to regularly update clients on  
our DE&I initiatives and accomplishments.
 -Expand our current supplier diversity programs.
COMMUNITY 
 -To complement our current partnerships with nonprofit organizations, identify  
additional organizations that our agencies enthusiastically support and offer our 
professional services on a pro bono basis to advance their goals.
MANDATORY TRAINING

to issues regarding DE&I, such as global, mandatory diversity and inclusion 
(including unconscious bias) training.
ACCOUNTABILITY 
 -Require every Omnicom agency to determine specified actions, with deadlines,  
to ensure advancement of DE&I initiatives.
 -Senior executives of Omnicom and the CEOs of each of our networks and

     INCLUSION THROUGH THE VALUABLE 500  
In 2020, Omnicom continued its commitment to people with disabilities as a 
signatory and strategic partner of The Valuable 500, a global collaboration of 
companies that have formally pledged to put disability inclusion on their business 
leadership agenda. In just its second year, The Valuable 500 increased its roster  
of signatories to total more than 430 different companies, including some of the 
world’s best-known brands. 
It is our responsibility to listen to every human 
reality so we can meet the needs of as many people 
as possible. Businesses are losing out on profits 
because their brand and employee experiences 
aren’t accessible to people with lived experience of 
disability. Ignoring these needs poses a huge risk 
to our businesses, brands and wider society.Marianne Waite  
Director of Inclusive Design, 
Interbrand
Together, The Valuable 500’s confirmed organizations represent 
over 14.8 million employees, more than $5.4 trillion in combined 
revenue and a footprint in 35 countries.
In many ways, the social-distancing measures imposed throughout much of the 
world in 2020 helped shed light on the types of challenges, isolation and frustration 
people with disabilities have faced for generations. As companies have accelerated 
efforts to create more accessible ways to work and shop, Omnicom has leveraged 
its global network of agencies and clients to elevate conversations about how to 
continue momentum around accessibility for the disability community — a group 
that represents nearly 1.3 billion people and billions in global spending power. 
As a result, Omnicom is helping The Valuable 500 evolve from a campaign to an 
active community, where signatories push each other to embed disability inclusivity 
more deeply into their leadership, culture and brand. More details about this 
transformation will be announced in 2021. Additional information on Omnicom’s 
internal disability efforts are shared on Page 20.

In the spirit of collaboration, many Omnicom agencies developed initiatives in 2020 to partner with 
diverse members of their community and drive more equitable opportunity.  
JUNIPER PARK  in Canada launched Trampoline, a DE&I initiative that serves as a branding incubator 
program for Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC)-owned businesses as well as an accelerator 
mentorship program for aspiring BIPOC creatives. Through Trampoline, Juniper Park provides a selected 
BIPOC-owned, small- or medium-sized business with pro bono branding services on a quarterly basis in 
support of their development, and offers a three-month paid internship to an aspiring BIPOC creative to 
provide development opportunities with some of the industry’s leading creatives.
KETCHUM  provided pro bono support of the HBCU Week Foundation. The organization’s annual 
signature event focuses on exposing high school students to historically black colleges and universities 
(HBCUs) by creating an authentic Homecoming Week experience. Due to the pandemic, HBCU Week 
occurred virtually, expanding access and participation opportunities for HBCUs and prospective students 
around the country. Ketchum supported the development of the HBCU Week Foundation’s narrative and 
aided the development and execution of its strategic marketing and communications plan. Overall, HBCU 
Week delivered more than 800 on-the-spot college acceptances and $7.3 million in scholarship offers from 
37 participating HBCUs during the college fair. The campaign resulted in a 75% increase in year-over-year 
attendee registrations. 
SPARKS & HONEY  rolled out a 1:1 employee donation matching program focused on supporting 
social and racial justice organizations including TGI Justice, Equal Justice Initiative, Black Girls Code, 
Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, Run With Maud, Fair Fight, Spread The Vote, Brotherhood Sister Sol, Black 
Lives Matter Global Network, One Struggle KC, Know Your Rights Camp and Campaign Zero. In addition, 
sparks & honey staff created “an incomplete list of anti-racist resources,” aggregating articles, podcasts,

Omnicom People Engagement Network (OPEN) is Omnicom’s 
umbrella group for all network employee resource groups (ERGs) 
and activities. In 2020, we committed to expand our Omnicomwide 
ERGs beyond Omniwomen and OPEN Pride as our employees 
searched for ways to foster belonging in a virtual environment.  
The groundwork laid in 2020 allowed us to launch new global  
ERGs focused on Black, Asian and Latinx communities in 2021.During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw even more need for 
community. While the physical separation from our colleagues 
was painful, it forced us to be creative, establish new networks 
and make connections to people in different agencies and cities 
that we may have never considered reaching out to before. Even 
in a post-pandemic world, we’ll be committed to ensuring that 
physical distance is not a major barrier to finding meaningful 
community and belonging at Omnicom.

Omniwomen is focused on promoting networking and career opportunities for 
women across our networks and agencies, as well as developing the female 
leaders of tomorrow. Over the last seven years, participation in Omniwomen has 
grown to include more than 10,000 members.  
While the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted some of Omniwomen’s new chapter 
launches and event plans early in 2020, the need to support women as they 
balanced work and home in a virtual environment became crucial. Omniwomen 
evolved to meet these needs throughout the following initiatives. 
INSTAGRAM LIVE LEADERSHIP SERIES 
   Omniwomen transformed its 
programming from a largely local chapter focus to a globally connected community. 
As part of these efforts, Omniwomen launched an Instagram Live Leadership Series  
profiling inspiring women leaders within the Omnicom network. Leaders included 
TBWA\Greater China CEO Joanne Lao, Goodby Silverstein & Partners Head of Equity, 
Diversity & Inclusion Dr. Jennifer Gomes, and DAS Europe President Emma Sergeant.  
The series was well received, prompting a second season in December 2020 and  
plans to continue the program into 2021.
STRONGER IN 2021 
   Toward the end of 2020, Omniwomen also launched 
Stronger in 2021, a weekly virtual series for women across Omnicom to discuss  
topics ranging from practicing empathy to promoting diversity. Omniwomen will 
continue the global initiative through 2021.
DIGITAL CHAPTER LAUNCHES 
   Not to be thwarted by the challenges of 
remote work, two new Omniwomen chapters were launched digitally in 2020 in 
Argentina and Brazil. The group's global programming continues to spur interest in 
Omniwomen around the world, with 10 new chapters planned to launch in 2021.In some ways, the virtual work environment 
liberated Omniwomen. We’re more imaginative, 
creative and resilient than before. We’ve opened  
new windows to connection. There’s fresh 
momentum and united power to actively reach 
and help more women inside Omnicom overcome 
challenges and achieve their ambitions.Valerie Accary,

OPEN PRIDE
Founded in 2016, OPEN Pride fuels the personal growth, organizational 
inclusion and business success of Omnicom Group's LGBTQIA+ employees  
and allies. In 2020, OPEN Pride established two new chapters in Dallas and 
Southern California and grew to engage nearly 4,000 Omnicom employees  
from around the globe.
Despite hurdles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, OPEN Pride achieved  
the following:
MENTORSHIP 
   OPEN Pride Dubai launched the second cohort of their 
internship program, called DDBTransit, specifically designed to help transgender 
workers find fulfilling career experiences in an inclusive work setting. 
LEADERSHIP 
   OPEN Pride again served as a Platinum Sponsor for NYC 
Pride’s fully digital 2020 celebration.
COMMUNITY 
   To build connection and support, OPEN Pride launched its

Across Omnicom networks and agencies, we are committed to ensuring our creative and production directors can 
draw from a diverse supplier base when assembling project teams. 
In 2020, ADAM&EVE  overhauled its supply chain processes and policies to champion diverse talent. These efforts 
included Fresh Takes, a new approach to triple bidding that aims to introduce and commission new, underrepresented  
talent with a specific focus on gender, ethnicity, sexual identity, neurodiverse talent and people with disabilities.  
adam&eve also participates in #SheTakesOver, an industrywide annual initiative to champion female stars across  
creative production, and Unstereotype Alliance, a platform that seeks to eradicate harmful gender-based  
stereotypes in all media and advertising content convened by UN Women, the United Nations entity  
for gender equality.
GSD&M ’s 11th annual Small & Diverse Vendor Partner Summit occurred virtually in 2020, challenging the  
agency to creatively re-engineer the agenda to ensure that small, diverse and underrepresented vendors  
had the opportunity to display their work, discuss their capabilities, gain access to key decision-makers,  
learn about next steps on how to do business with agencies and share potential opportunities.  
The efforts proved successful: There were nearly three times the number of participants than the  
agency planned. 
THE MARKETING ARM (TMA)  launched a Partner Relations program to attract and monitor  
activities with diverse suppliers. As part of the program, TMA is establishing relationships with the  
National Minority Supplier Development Council, National Veteran Business Development Council,  
Women’s Business Council Southwest and the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce. In 2020,  
the agency spent more than $11 million total in diverse suppliers and vendors, approximately  
13% of total overall spend.

Omnicom University is considered one of the preeminent management and leadership development 
programs in the industry. The format is based on the Harvard Business School case study method and 
led by professors from Harvard Business School and IESE Business School in Spain. In the 26 years 
since its founding, the program has grown to offer 11 programs a year on two continents.
Due to the risks of COVID-19, Omnicom University did not conduct classes in 2020, instead focusing 
its efforts on digital programming for its network of nearly 5,200 global alumni. This included monthly 
classes from Omnicom University professors on timely topics, such as building resilience and leading 
in a crisis. Each virtual webinar had up to 350 attendees who were encouraged to share a recording 
with their own teams. Feedback on the courses was overwhelmingly positive, with some referring  
to the content as a lifeline during a particularly challenging time for organizational leaders.
More information about Omnicom University’s programs for leaders at different stages of 
their careers, as well as Omnicomwide training and development programs during a typical year, 
including Emerging Stars for top junior talent, is included on Pages 23 and 25 of our 2019 Corporate 
Responsibility Report. REIMAGINING TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
We continue to place great emphasis on helping our people learn and develop in their 
careers. Each year, Omnicom makes substantial investments in education and training,  
and 2020 was no exception. While we had to pause in-person trainings for the majority  
of the year, we doubled down on digital opportunities for development.

DE&I TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES  
Following the social unrest in response to acts of violence against diverse communities over the summer of 2020,  
Omnicom agencies responded quickly to support their communities and employees while addressing systemic issues  
related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
HALL & PARTNERS  in the U.K. held six “Unlearn” training sessions hosted by several expert trainers to delve into  
unconscious bias, cultural appropriation and microaggressions, totaling 1,500 hours of training and nearly 100%  
participation. Many offices held follow up “Reflect” sessions to further discuss the learnings and how they might do  
things differently moving forward.  
OMNICOM MEDIA GROUP (OMG)  provided inclusive management training for all managers, hosted  
allyship sessions with more than 2,000 participants, and brought employees together for education,  
support and discussion through webinars focused on topics such as “Learning to Mitigate Bias” and  
“Recognizing and Busting Microaggressions.” 
PORTER NOVELLI  developed the “Come Together” series for employees, with sessions on a range of  
DE&I topics including Implicit Bias, Whiteness 101, Becoming a Better Ally, How to Be an Anti-Racist,  
Creating a Culture of Belonging and a discussion about “The Talks” that Black parents have with their  
children about growing up Black in America. Through this series, employees got the opportunity to  
have frank conversations and help one another understand identity and its effect on the way  
we see the world. The program was so successful that it was quickly adapted for client trainings.

OHG University is Omnicom Health Group’s core learning and development offering available 
to all Omnicom employees. Though traditionally delivered in a live, in-person format, Omnicom 
Health Group converted OHG University to an online setting in 2020. Omnicom Health Group 
offered more than 300 different virtual learning opportunities covering a range of topics, 
including personal and professional development; leadership development; diversity, equity 
and inclusion; coaching; team-building workshops; and on-demand learning. The Group 
presented 42 unique virtual instructor-led training (VIL T) classes, 23 of which were developed 
and launched in 2020, and 19 of which were converted into virtual classes from previous live 
course offerings.
Despite the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Omnicom Health Group saw an 
upsurge in online learning participation in 2020. After making its core management program 
virtual, Omnicom Health Group had 499 employees graduate in 2020 – more than tripling 
the 162 graduates who completed the program in 2019. In addition, 96% of employees 
participated in at least one voluntary online training program through OHG University in 2020. 
Employees also took advantage of Omnicom Health Group’s Grovo and LinkedIn Learning 
partnerships, logging more than 11,000 combined hours engaged in learning and development 
content through the two providers.

The events of 2020 reinforced the importance of our people’s health and safety. Omnicom continues to offer comprehensive and quality healthcare 
benefits to U.S. employees while maintaining a degree of individual choice to meet our employees’ diverse needs. Since 2016, Omnicom has covered 
transgender-related services under our medical plans, which are regularly updated and cover almost all U.S. employees and their eligible family members.
Our agencies also instituted several initiatives to help employees care for the health  
and well-being of themselves and their families throughout the year.
AMV BBDO collaborated with Self Space, a modern app-booking based therapy service, 
offering up to eight sessions per employee. They also offered a paid membership for all 
employees to Calm, the number one app for sleep, meditation and relaxation. In addition,  
AMV BBDO trained eight employees in Mental Health First Aid and ran agencywide informational 
sessions for employees to explore resources on how to prioritize their mental health during the 
pandemic.
TRACYLOCKE helped its employees set boundaries by implementing a mental wellness 
initiative called Quiet Time, blocking employee calendars once a week from 12-2 p.m. to 
encourage employees to unplug and focus on matters of importance to them, such as helping 
their kids with homeschooling, working out or relaxing. In addition, to support working 
parents, the agency invited Ruthann Horvay, a childhood development specialist, to host a 
series of forums to help them navigate the increased stress they’ve experienced during the 
pandemic. Topics ranged from the importance of taking care of themselves in addition to their 
children, how to balance work while monitoring remote schooling and thinking through the 
difficult decision of sending children back to school in-person.EXPANDED PARENTAL

Black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white  
people. And oftentimes, when police officers are questioned why they pulled 
the trigger, they say, “I thought they had a gun.” The Courageous Conversation 
Global Foundation (CCGF), an organization that leads bias training workshops 
to help drive systemic change through interracial healing, teamed up with 
Goodby Silverstein & Partners to create “Not a Gun,” a campaign to bring 
awareness to this tragic reality. The campaign launched in February 2020 
with a film illustrating how a candy bar in a white person’s hand can translate 
to a gun when in a Black person's hand. Later in the year, after the deaths of 
Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, they launched a second 
film, “Being Black is Not a Crime.” The work helped CCGF earn a 900% increase 
in racial-sensitivity training.

Theirworld is a global charity dedicated to ending the education crisis to ensure every child can fulfill their potential. Through 
innovative campaigns, policies and partnerships, Theirworld seeks to target and solve the complex barriers that are preventing 
youth from receiving a quality education. In 2020, Omnicom agencies supported Theirworld’s goals by providing strategic 
communications, research and digital counsel and expertise to the organization. 
Hall & Partners collaborated with Theirworld to facilitate research and generate insights about the attitudes of U.K. youth toward 
young women and refugees. The findings revealed evidence of existing prejudice, highlighting that while 89% of the U.K.’s young 
people ages 14 to 30 believe education is a human right, only 44% strongly agree that refugees deserve the same consideration. 
The partnership brought public awareness to these findings on International Women’s Day — making the case for more urgent 
public action for quality, equitable education.

We are making steady progress against our energy-usage goals, and are currently developing new goals and 
commitments to reduce the carbon emissions produced by our operations and source our electricity from 
renewable sources. Soon, we will also be joining the Science Based Targets Initiative, which audits participating 
companies on their emissions goals and evaluates whether they are in-line with the global mandate to keep 
warming down below 1.5 degrees.
COVID-19’S EFFECT ON ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS
Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the buildings across our footprint were 
sparsely used in 2020. Travel and commuting were reduced dramatically, as well. These situations 
impacted our use of energy, which are reflected in the environmental metrics we track, representing 
an acceleration toward meeting our goals that will likely not be replicated as the world returns to 
pre-pandemic activities. We recognize some of the energy use was shifted to homes and other off-
site locations as our employees worked remotely, but we are unable to measure this impact.

ACROSS OUR GLOBAL FOOTPRINT
We continue to explore ways to use our owned and leased real estate more 
efficiently. Doing so not only helps reduce our environmental impact, it also 
brings our agencies together and sparks creativity. 
Greenhouse gas emissions from buildings continue to be a significant challenge 
globally, and we embrace the opportunity to seek solutions. While the pandemic 
resulted in greatly reduced emissions across the office landscape in 2020, 
it didn’t slow down our efforts to address our long-term plans to make our 
workplaces more environmentally friendly. 
To that end, we continued our efforts to transition to more efficient and 
collaborative workspaces and hub buildings in many of our markets. In fact,  
we eliminated more than 1 million square feet of space from our footprint 
during 2020. 
Well before the pandemic began, we started the process of transitioning to 
agile work environments in place of the dedicated workstations that have long 
been staples of the office environment. These forward-thinking, unassigned 
workspaces are designed to give employees flexibility without affecting 
productivity, all while optimizing our square footage. 
48 LETTER     ABOUT OMNICOM     PEOPLE     COMMUNITY     ENVIRONMENT      GOVERNANCE     ABOUT THIS REPORT     UNGC COMMUNICATION     GRIThe pandemic, in many ways, accelerated this transition. Virtually overnight, 
employees embraced collaboration tools, such as video conferencing, as they 
quickly adapted to remote work. In locations where employees have returned  
to the office in shared environments, we’ve employed desk-reservation systems 
while complying with stringent social-distancing, mask-wearing and  
sanitization protocols.
As we continue to enhance our operations, we are also evaluating what the 
future of work looks like at Omnicom. Our leadership on a local level is working 
on gathering feedback from employees and clients to help us decide what the 
"new normal" will be — one where we can service our clients effectively while 
also connecting with colleagues in the safest and most flexible way possible.
We expect that even as conditions improve, employees will continue to use 
virtual collaboration tools, which should reduce reliance on travel as compared 
to pre-pandemic levels. 
Our building and retrofitting activities are guided by our global planning 
standard, which includes Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED®) principles. Across our footprint, we continue to prioritize energy-
efficient lighting, heating and cooling, and reducing and reusing materials. 
We’re also saving energy and reducing waste through shared conference  
rooms and service areas, state-of-the-art video conferencing, virtual file 
storage and printing centers.

greenhouse gas emissions. Here are some examples of how we worked toward a healthier planet 
in 2020:
The  OMD EMEA  headquarters in London launched OMD Green — a proactive initiative aiming to 
decrease carbon emissions across the advertising industry. The initiative encourages clients to develop 
sustainable practices and helps them take the necessary steps to get there.

While we continued to take steps to reduce energy consumption in 2020, the pandemic made  
it impossible for us to accurately measure the true impact. 
In 2020, we continued to cut our global energy consumption, using 114,901 megawatt-hours 
(MWh) of energy, a 22% reduction compared to 2019. We also cut our electricity use by 20%,  
from 131,990 MWh in 2019 to 105,164 MWh in 2020. 
We reduced our companywide greenhouse gas emissions by 63% in 2020, compared to 2019,  
due to the impacts of increased remote work and decreased travel which caused substantial 
reductions in the direct emissions, business-travel emissions and purchased electricity emissions 
that we track.
As part of Omnicom’s strategy to curb our carbon footprint, we derive a portion of our electricity 
needs from renewable sources. These efforts are spearheaded in the U.K., where we are buying 
green power in buildings that we manage through electricity purchasing agreements. In the 
U.S., more than 90% of our electricity spend is through landlords in our leased spaces, and we 
encourage them to seek renewable energy sources whenever possible. In 2020, total electricity 
purchased from renewable resources was 20,165 MWh, accounting for 19% of total electricity, 
compared to 16% of total electricity in 2019. This is advancing our goal to increase our use  
of electricity from renewable sources globally to 20% by 2023.

of the project, we set a goal to reuse, recycle and/or recover 
98% of the waste created by the effort. We topped that goal by 
diverting 99.68% of the nearly 24 tons of waste generated away 
from landfills. Because of our recycling efforts, we saved an 
equivalent of 142.28 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.GLOBAL ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES (MWH)

RALL YING THE UK TO PROTECT PRODUCE
Due to the pandemic and associated travel restrictions, the fresh produce 
sector faced a severe shortfall of skilled migrant labour to help harvest produce. 
This meant that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of the country’s fruit and 
vegetables were at risk of being left to rot in the ground. Waitrose, a major buyer 
of UK fresh produce, wanted to find a way to support UK growers and farmers 
and help urgently recruit 70,000 fruit and vegetable pickers to the sector to 
bridge this labour deficit. In partnership with adam&eve and ITV, Waitrose 
launched a multichannel call to arms in support of the government’s Pick For 
Britain initiative. With primetime TV spots and placements across national print 
and digital outlets, Waitrose urged the British public to get involved in the effort 
and drove potential applicants to the pickforbritain.org.uk website, where local 
vacancies were listed. Furthermore, targeted content was delivered via social 
media platforms to raise awareness among students, graduates and younger 
people looking for contracts over the summer. The campaign contributed 
toward getting enough pickers to reap the harvest, meaning tons of fruits and 
vegetables that would otherwise have gone to landfill ended up on our tables.

We accomplished our goal and finalized our Supplier Code of Conduct  in 2020, detailing the high  
standards we expect from those who provide goods and services to us. All individuals and organizations  
in the Omnicom supply chain must endorse our values by operating ethically and complying with the  
Code, which covers 15 principles that are fundamental to how we do business — ranging from human  
rights and workplace safety to environmental responsibility and data security. The Code is intended to 
promote a culture of compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations among our suppliers. 
Additionally, we ask our suppliers to hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS POLICY
In 2021, Omnicom’s Board of Directors adopted a Political Contributions Policy to codify its positions 
and provide oversight and accountability with regard to political contributions and participation in the U.S. 
political process. The policy governs Omnicom’s consideration and approval of political activities in the  
U.S., including political contributions at the federal, state and local levels. It also formalizes our long-
standing practices and provides oversight to the very limited number of political contributions our agencies 
make from time to time.  In 2020, Omnicom and its agencies made no political contributions.
A few of the key highlights of the policy include:
Omnicom does not have a company-sponsored PAC and generally does not make corporate political contributions
In the rare event that monetary political contributions over $10,000 are requested to be made, we have a formal 
review process in place which requires approval by Omnicom’s worldwide CFO and each such contribution would  
be reported to our Board’s Governance Committee
The participation of Omnicom and its agencies as members of trade associations comes with the understanding 
that their membership does not represent agreement with the positions, views or objectives of the trade 
associations or of other members, but a belief that their support will help advance policy objectives aligned  
with the interests of Omnicom and its agenciesPROTECTING ADVERTISERS   
FROM HATE SPEECH
In recent years, algorithms used by social 
networks and other online forums have led 
to advertisements from many respected 
businesses, including Omnicom clients, 
appearing on webpages with hate speech 
and other inappropriate content. While both 
Omnicom and our clients condemn hate 
speech, these major technology companies 
have struggled to employ guardrails to prevent 
advertisements from showing up next to 
unacceptable content. In 2020, Omnicom 
formed a coalition of influential companies 
with the goal of compelling social networks 
and other online forums to take measures 
protecting advertisers from being associated 
with inappropriate content. To date, the Council 
on Accountable Social Advertising has made 
meaningful progress toward achieving the goal 
and continues to push for additional protections.
