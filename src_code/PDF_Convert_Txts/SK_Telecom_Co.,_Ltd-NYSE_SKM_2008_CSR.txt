deliver happiness to all corners of society. We will continue to introduce innovative
services to secure safe mobile communications access to all people while addressingmajor issues facing the world such as climate change and the aging population. Indoing so, we also hope to contribute to revitalizing the national economy.

Sustainability Management Framework
SKTelecom incorporates stakeholders sopinions in carrying out its business activities. Separate
units have been set up for each of the major stakeholder groups identified by SKMS to enhance
communication between the company and stakeholders.
Corporate Citizenship Committee
The Corporate Citizenship Committee was created under the Board of Directors in May 2008.
Composed of three independent directors and two standing directors, the committee overseespolicies, performance and communication related to sustainability management. The committeeconvened for two meetings in 2008, during which the members discussed progress to date andareas for improvement. Based on review of the company
ssactivities and the related risks and
opportunities, the committee initially decided to focus on five areas, namely the environment, win-winpartnerships, customer protection, community involvement and ethics. Going forward, the focusareas will be adjusted based on materiality assessment taking into account future sustainabilitymanagement activities and progress together with stakeholder demands.
The ultimate objective of sustainability management at SK Telecom is to embed the spirit of
CSR
(Corporate Social Responsibility) in all business activities to enable sustainable growth and value
creation. In 2009, we plan to create a sustainability management council comprising heads of thepertinent departments which will support activities of the Corporate Citizenship Committee. We alsointend to designate and track KPIs
(Key Performance Indicators) on sustainability management.

Organizational Scheme for Sustainability Management
[Focus areas  ]
The BOD consists of eight directors including three standing directors and five outside directors and the CEO chairs the
Board. SK Telecom has been working to raise the expertise and independence of the BOD through measures such as
appointing outside directors after input from the Independent Director Recommendation Committee while striving to ensureconflicts of interest are avoided. Moreover, Independent Directors Briefings and Independent Directors Preliminary Approval
Meetings are regularly held to boost the role of outside directors. Compensation of directors is approved at the general

Dissemination & Education
SK Telecom conducts online training on win-win partnerships, customer protection, community
involvement and ethics in order to raise employee awareness of the importance of increasing value forstakeholders. More in-depth training is provided to personnel in each department designated tooversee win-win partnerships, information security, community involvement, and ethics andcompliance. In 2009, special emphasis will be placed on environmental management, an area thatcalls for greater attention, by introducing an online training course on the environment to be taken byall employees.
Risk Management Process
Stakeholders may file complaints through our Ethical Counseling Center and customer centers.
Based on the filed complaints, we identify processes that have or may cause damage or losses forstakeholders and take corrective action to prevent recurrences. Periodic meetings are held tocontinuously identify complaints or demands from regulatory bodies, government, legislature,business partners and competitors. When a particular issue is identified as substantial risk, a taskforce team is set up to prepare countermeasures before a problem actually occurs. In 2009, we plan
to introduce preemptive measures against risks to stakeholders, including mandatory preliminaryscreening for infringement of customer values related to new product development.
Performance Evaluation and Monitoring
At present, sustainability management performance is evaluated by the departments in charge of the
respective areas. Sustainability management is not explicitly stated in the criteria for assessingperformance of the Board, but the Board is to play an important role in promoting sustainabilitymanagement through the Corporate Citizenship Committee. Sustainability performance and plans willbe reviewed by the committee on a regular basis in 2009. In addition, Sustainability KPIs that apply tothe entire company will be selected to monitor companywide progress in sustainability management.
External Recognition
In September 2008, SK Telecom was named as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability
Indexes by Dow Jones of the US and Sustainable Asset Management(SAM) based inSwitzerland. We received high marks in customer relationship management, customer privacyprotection, and human resources development. However, our scores were lower in riskmanagement, environmental management, and stakeholder engagement. Subsequently, SKTelecom ranked third in the AccountAbility Rating Korea 2008 announced in January 2009.

social welfare in 2003 for effective implementation of community involvement activities. The group ssreach
will expand to sustainability management, environment, fair competition and corporate governance in2009, and will start operating under the new name of SK Telecom CSR Advisory Panel. The panel will

Stakeholder
CommunicationsCommunication Principles
AtSK Telecom, stakeholder communications is based on the company ssphilosophy of
increasing value for diverse stakeholders. The 12th revision of SKMS in 2008 classified
stakeholders for corporate relations into customers, employees, shareholders, government,
business partners, and the general public. The revised SKMS also sets forth principles for
communicating with stakeholders. Based on clearly defined stakeholder segments and
principles, we conduct activities to identify their expectations and demands, and draw up
corresponding strategies with a view to maximizing return for SK Telecom and its stakeholders.
Communication Activities
Â Customers Â Some 5,000 personnel working at our 12 customer counseling centers and
8CRM centers across Korea handle about 8.5 million cases each month. Most of the cases last year
had to do with call quality, billing and payment, customer inconveniences, additional services, andpayment plans. Employees are informed of frequent complaints raised by customers through the
company intranet, while a dedicated unit works to make necessary corrections and improvements.Going beyond just listening to the customer, SK Telecom pursues customer experience managementunder which we oversee all matters experienced by the customer while applying for and using ourservices.
Â Employees Â The labor-management council holds four meetings a year during which the
two sides discuss ways for mutual cooperation. Subjects of discussion in 2008 included changes toemployee compensation and benefits and how to improve the work environment. The managementalso informed the labor union of the company
ssoverseas investments, BOD agenda items, and
organizational restructuring. SK Telecom constantly gathers employees sopinions on major company
issues through channels such as the CEO Hotline and internal newsletter.
Â Shareholders and Analysts Â  Meetings and seminars are organized to explain the
company ssmanagement activities to investors and analysts in Korea and abroad. In 2008, we held a
total of 417 IR meetings. Individual investors and shareholders can gain access to companyinformation at their convenience through the company website.
Â Business Partners Â SK Telecom carries out a wide range of communication activities
to cater to the needs of business partners. We operate an online VoP (Voice of Partners) channel
(partneron.sktelecom.com) ,through which partner firms can convey the difficulties they face and make
suggestions. In August 2008, we opened a website (open2u.sktelecom.com) through which small- and
mid-size venture companies can propose new ideas.
Â Government, NGOs and Local Communities Â  We maintain regular communi-
cation with major regulatory agencies including the Korea Communications Commission and worktogether to address various social issues. We also pursue dialogue with civic groups and localcommunities when pertinent, such as during the course of setting up new base stations. Periodicmeetings are held with NGOs including those who disapprove of our policies or activities in order togain their understanding. We also provide consistent support to NGOs whose causes coincide withour community involvement initiatives.Access to video telephony

manage issues in which stakeholders have a keen interest and issues with a potentially large
impact on our business activities. Related to the GRI Guideline Indicators, we endeavor to convey
detailed and accurate information on our performance centered on the core indicators.
Materiality Assessment Procedure
In 2009, we conducted an analysis to decide on the inclusion of new issues and to examine the
level of interest in society and impact on SK Telecom according to the 5 Parts Materiality TestFramework set by AA1000. We upgraded the company homepage to introduce a channel forfeedback on our sustainability report. The feedback was incorporated when deriving the majorissues. In preparing this sustainability report, we conducted face-to-face interviews with sixKorean experts on sustainability management. Their opinions were reflected in the reportpreparation process.
Major Issues Derived from Materiality Assessment
The eleven major issues are covered in the tMateriality Issues to Our Business and Society u
section of the report. Issues deemed to have a relatively lower significance are detailed in the
tMeasuring Our Progress usection and will be reported on our website by the end of 2009.  
Going forward, we will conduct the materiality assessment using information gained fromcorporate-wide communication with stakeholders throughout the year.

Standardization of Smart SIM
AtMobile World Congress 2009, a project to collaborate on Smart SIM specifications was officially
launched. Through activities at GSMA, SK Telecom has stressed the importance of standardization of
Smart SIM technology. Smart SIM is the technology that expands the capacity of USIM (Universal
Subscriber Identity Module) and allows the users to keep their contents and personalized mobile
applications through successive replacements of handsets. Through this technology, we expect that
mobile communications companies will be able to develop new business models without being
restricted to specific handsets, and that handset manufacturers can concentrate on designs and
quality improvement and reduce the overall cost and time used in R&D. SK Telecom plans to lead the
standardization of Smart SIM technology through collaboration with mobile operators, card
developers, and handset makers and ensure that a new market is successfully developed.
Standar dization of Next-generation Mobile Gateway Service
Since 2008, SK Telecom has proposed the need for the standardization of the next-generation
Mobile Gateway Service (Converged Personal Network Service) .Its proposal was approved by OMA, the
worldsslargest standardization body, as an official standardization item in August 2008. The next-
generation Mobile Gateway Service is a technology that enables users of personal navigation deviceor portable multimedia player to access multimedia contents from their mobile phones through themobile communications network. SK Telecom is presently collaborating with Qualcomm, Ericsson,NTT DOCOMO, Toshiba, China Mobile, Samsung and LG to develop optimal internationalspecifications.
Open Innovation
SK Telecom has strived to combine the Web 2.0 spirit of openness, participation and sharing with
win-win cooperation to discover and foster strategic partnership opportunities. Since 2004, we
have sponsored a total of KRW 17.7 billion to support technology development of externalresearch organizations and SME partners, and viable new businesses are being explored invarious areas including satellite broadcasting and anti-piracy systems. In 2008, Open2U waslaunched, and to promote this program, a second Open Idea+Festival was organized where
more than 470 business ideas were submitted.

Service Qualityand ReliabilityCall Quality
SKTelecom has received high customer ratings on basic services including call quality, as
indicated by the results of major customer satisfaction surveys such as National Customer
Satisfaction Index, Korean Customer Satisfaction Index and Korea Standards on Service Quality
Index. Since we set up a nationwide WCDMA network in 2007, we have managed to secure the
same level of call quality for WCDMA as for the existing CDMA network through continuous
investments. In 2009, we plan to optimize network structure and enhance customer experience
byoffering a more diverse range of mobile devices and services, enabled by seamless service
continuity technology between networks. Lately, the public has called for greater disclosure of
information regarding call quality by mobile service providers. In response, SK Telecom joined the
Service Quality Assessment Council, consisting of members from the Korea Communications
Commission, the academia, NGOs, and the Korea Telecommunications Operators Association.
Weare currently in the process of building a service quality information website jointly with other
mobile communications operators.
Digital Inclusion
In order to extend network coverage in offshore and coastal regions, SK Telecom has utilized
existing infrastructure such as lighthouses to install repeaters and provide network services. In2008, as part of our quality differentiation campaign, we carried out village-by-village networkquality improvement projects. In 2009, remote regions will be included in this campaign to focuson areas with poor access. Along with other communications common carriers, SK Telecom
contributes to providing universal telecommunication services, such as services for isolatedmountainous regions or islands. The 2007 universal services contribution finalized in March 2009was KRW 93.8 billion out of which 34.5%(KRW 32.3 billion) will be borne by SK Telecom as perthe decision of the Korea Communications Commission.
Effect of Electromagnetic Radiation
Pursuant to Article 65 of the Radio Waves Act of Korea, SK Telecom takes regular measurements
of electromagnetic(EM) radiation originating from base stations whose transmitter device emitsmore than 30 Watts of power within the proximity of residential, commercial, industrial andregulated sites. With additional installation of WCDMA base stations and FAs in 2008, the scopeof monitoring increased, and a total of 1,625 measurements were taken with the results fallingbelow the specified limits. Furthermore, SK Telecom has contributed to a government-ledresearch project on the effects of EM radiation on the human body since 2000. SK Telecom isproviding KRW 150 million a year for the project from 2007 to 2011. Currently, seven tasks areunderway, including one to create a database of base stations and other EM radiation emittingdevices

Lower Rates and Discounts
SKTelecom has taken various steps to respond to demands to ease the cost burden of telecom
services. We have been offering the caller identification (CID) service for free from January 2006.
Wealso introduced a plan under which discounted rates are applied to calls made between SK
Telecom service subscribers in October 2007 and we lowered rates on text messaging in January
2008. In addition, we are receiving positive customer feedback for our efforts to lower household
telecom service costs such as discount plans for families, discounts for long-term users or
between SK Telecom subscribers, and plans that bundle wired and wireless services. We estimate
household telecom expenditures to have fallen by nearly KRW 457.4 billion in 2008 alone.
Customized Fee Plans
SK Telecom provides customized fee plans to subscribers according to their call patterns. When
asubscriber logs onto the online customer service center and enters essential details (including
age, call frequency, and text message frequency) ,he/she will receive a recommendation for two types
of call plans and can switch to a new plan online. Every month, 80,000 subscribers utilize this
service. In addition, we have introduced fee plans suitable for subscribers with regular callpatterns such as students.
Preventing tBilling Shock u
In addition to providing clear billing details to subscribers, SK Telecom has introduced ceilings
and fixed rate plans for data usage. We offer a ceiling program for 060 data usage to preventcustomers from incurring excessive voice data fees for services like fortune-telling and chatting. Apassword-protection program for 060 numbers was introduced in January 2009. Under the
program, users are required to input a password for access to 060 numbers.
Easing the Cost Burden for the Underprivileged
We offer the Silver Plan for senior citizens, the i-Kids Plan for children aged 12 years or under,
and a pricing plan to meet the needs of the disabled to alleviate the burden of customers whocannot easily use the mobile telecom services for economic reasons. In October 2008, weexpanded the application of our fee reduction program for the underprivileged to offer a 50%discount on the basic fee and call charges for minimum wage households with no initialsubscription charges and a 35% discount on the basic fee and call charges with no initialsubscription charges for the next lower income bracket. We also decided to provide recycledhandsets to those in such income brackets. Around 200,000 applications were received beforethe end of 2008 under the extended fee reduction program.Issue _04

CustomerPrivacyProtectionCustomer Information Management System
Inresponse to heightened concern over customer privacy, we designated a CPO (Chief Privacy
Officer) incharge of the company sscustomer information protection and a CSO (Chief Security Officer)
heading the company sssecurity matters in 2008. In addition, policies on the entire process of
gathering customer data to destroying it have been firmly established and related activities have
been strengthened. As we entered 2009, we devised a master plan for customer privacy, under
which we will pursue preventive measures based on stronger checks on overall business
activities that deal with customer data and countermeasures to promptly respond to any privacy
orsecurity incidents.
Stricter Customer Information Handling Pr ocess
SK Telecom is continuously working to improve the process of handling customer information.
We have updated the policies and guidelines for customer privacy and introduced the CPO pre-approval process. We regularly conduct education programs and checks on employees andvendors. In April 2007, we established the first Security Operation Center in Korea to centralize
internal and external access points to customer data. The center
ssinformation security
management system has obtained the ISO27001 certification. In 2008, the internal infrastructureto protect customer privacy was further improved with the building of Customer DataTransmission System to prevent potential risks that may arise during the transmission ofcustomer information.
Preventing Customer Data Leak and Misuse in Distribution Channel
In 2008, SK Telecom established guidelines to minimize the risk of customer information leakage
in the retail network and conducted 2,380 inspections and education programs on customer
privacy. We were the first to adopt a system of having retail shops keep a scanned image of anapplication form while handing over the original copy to the customer. The system is intended toprevent customer data leaks during the service application process. Also, SK Telecom isequipped with the Fraud Management System that allows us to monitor and quickly act on thepossibility of duplicated handsets using stolen personal information.
Response to Revised Customer Privacy Protection Laws
Growing awareness on customer privacy and stronger legislative measures demand more stern
measures for customer privacy protection and SK Telecom is operating a companywidecommittee accordingly. We have also introduced a mechanism for identification based on meansother than an individual's identity card number. We plan to further install the necessary systems inview of tighter regulations during 2009.Security Operation Center

Youth Protection
SKTelecom voluntarily discontinued service of wireless Internet adult contents in 2006 and have
made strides in youth protection ever since. During 2008, we newly introduced a Harmful
Contents Filtering Service which automatically filters out harmful contents when a UCC site user
tries to upload contents either through a wired or wireless platform. We also continued with the
thappy mobile phone culture ucampaign directed towards teenagers launched in 2007.
Campaign Homepage  http://www.happymobile.or.kr
SMS Spam Prevention
Since 2006, we have put in place a management system targeting companies that send out
spam, and developed a system and service for blocking SMS spam. This resulted in a significantdecline in customer complaints regarding spam SMS. In 2009, we will not only take swift actionto prevent and handle complaints but will also take prevention measures such as tighter controlover spam senders.
Assistance for Telecom Service Utilization
SK Telecom provides education for customers who are not accustomed to mobile telecom
services. In particular, education is conducted in conjunction with members of SK Telecom ss
collegiate volunteer group, Sunny, which is helping to narrow the divide between generations andbetween differing social brackets. Furthermore, we offer sign language and chatting services forcustomers with verbal and hearing disabilities
(##114 + video telephony, weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and a
service for foreigners (080-252-5011, 1599-2011, 24-hour service in English, Japanese and Chinese) .
Declaring a Clean Open Market
Although Korea ssopen market is growing at a pace of 20~30% a year, product credibility has
been cited as a major issue. To differentiate itself from open market forerunners, SK Telecom ss
11th Street offers a t110% guarantee for fakes u(if a product sold at 11th Street is found to be a fake, the
customer will receive a 100% refund plus 10% of the product price as loyalty points) andtsafe shopping guarantee u

Responding to ClimateChangeSK Telecom ssRole for Low Carbon Green Growth
While providing functions that make life more convenient such as real-time information on traffic
conditions and digital home service, SK Telecom is expanding services designed to promote
green and energy conserving lifestyles. As the No. 1 mobile telecom service provider in Korea, we
are sharing our experience to lead the standardization of handset related equipment such as
battery chargers with global peers and negotiating with related parties to reduce packaging
materials for mobile handsets. On top of such efforts, SK Telecom will continue to invest in R&D
onICT such as ZigBee and Smart Grid, which should help save energy and resources, and will
provide the platform to promote green growth in other industries.
Energy Ef ficiency
Higher average temperatures due to climate change, extreme weather conditions and rising
water levels are risk factors that could threaten the operation of mobile telecom networks. Inparticular, the rise in the average temperature increases the need for air conditioning, which inturn will lead to higher costs. SK Telecom is actively working to improve energy efficiency from
network management to customer service.
Management of Networks and Office Buildings
Since June 2008, SK Telecom has been carrying out companywide energy saving campaigns.
Entering 2009, we have sequentially installed energy conserving facilities such as refrigeration systems
in our office buildings. Also, we endeavor to improve energy efficiency through the virtualization ofserver equipment and the use of low power amplifiers. We plan to bring in wireless stations which userenewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, and once the efficiency of these areproven, we expect to widen their application.
Customer Service
To conserve natural resources and energy in the course of customer service, SK Telecom has
introduced an electronic billing system, remote upgrade of handsets, and virtual customer servicesutilizing the website and mobile handsets. In 2008, we replaced around two thousand signboardlighting with environmentally friendly LED following the introduction of a new brand identity. We plan touse LED lighting for signboards of newly opening stores. We also plan to introduce LED for auxiliarysignboards during 2009.

Building Infrastructure for Innovation
Tofoster a creative and global organizational culture, the wide range of titles representing various
ranks was consolidated into the single title of tmanagerutoward the end of 2006. Adoption of the
manager system resulted in greater delegation of authority and responsibility based on individual
competence regardless of a person ssrank. That, in turn, has helped to build a creative and
enterprising culture and boost employee engagement. In late 2007, we implemented a
CIC(Company-In-Company) system to promote responsible management of each business unit.
Under the system, we are working to streamline business processes and build systems and an
organizational culture attuned to each CIC.
Towards a Global Enterprise
To create a workplace where people of diverse nationalities can work without being hindered by
language barriers, we are expanding our bilingual (English and Korean) organization and raisingawareness of international cultures through a global internship program. English is being adoptedfor our work systems to set up a global work infrastructure. A global lounge manned by bilingual
facilitators provides assistance for international work processes. In 2008, we appointed a foreign national as the executive in charge of HR management tostrengthen our global business capabilities. We plan to increase foreign representation in ourworkforce through global internships that guarantee a position with the company.
Working Cultur eInnovation
For long-term growth of our employees through enhanced work-life balance, SK Telecom carried
out a campaign in 2008 to improve employee engagement during work hours through better
work practices and processes. As a part of the campaign, we identified causes for overtime work
and implemented improvements. We also introduced partial flexible working hours in accordancewith a unit

ComplianceCompliance Program
In2002, SK Telecom introduced the Compliance Program under the belief that the company
would gain a greater competitive edge through voluntary compliance with the fair competition
law. Accordingly, we distribute CP checklists and hold related education on an annual basis, in
addition to presenting clear action plans to prevent violations. We also set up an internal system
for early detection and handling of such violations. We created a CP portal to facilitate
understanding of relevant fair competition laws. The portal which opened in March 2009 provides
detailed examples of unfair practices that may transpire during the work process.
Promoting Fair Competition for Win-Win Partnership
In line with the declaration of SK Group sswin-win partnership and compliance program in
September 2008, SK Telecom is committed to improving related practices and systems toprevent unfair transaction during the contract signing and execution and supplier selection andmanagement phases. Our goal is to build a culture of fair competition with our business partners.As part of our efforts to promote such a culture, we set up a purchasing review committee in
December 2008. The committee is responsible for guaranteeing appropriateness, fairness andlawfulness during contract signing and pricing.
Complying with Service Regulations
In addition to complying with the Telecommunications Business Act and other related laws, SK
Telecom is working towards reducing any risks that may occur in various processes ofestablishing a business model, contracts, sales and PR activities, such as inflicting damages oncustomers and hindering competition. Thanks to these efforts and changes in the regulatory
environment which lifted a ban on mobile phone subsidies, SK Telecom paid much smaller
penalties of KRW 2.15 billion in 2008. The penalties were levied in connection with fee plans andvalue-added service subscription, temporary mobile phone service, and T-Ring subscription.

CSR Activities for Our Communities sFuture
SKTelecom is pursuing youth and education-centered community involvement programs
tailored to the needs of respective overseas markets such as China and Vietnam where we have
built up a presence.
Â ChinaÂ In August 2007, we opened the Yanbian IT Center offering IT training to teens and
university students in Yanbian, an area where computer and Internet education is underdeveloped.Subsequently in January 2008, the SK Fund was created under an agreement between China
ss
Communist Youth League and SK to support educational programs for college and middle/highschool students. Construction of an elementary school devastated by the 2008 Sichuan earthquakeswill be completed by August 2009. 
Â Vietnam Â In December 2007, we opened the SKT-SSU IT Training Center in Ho Chi Minh
to foster local IT professionals. In particular, outstanding trainees from the center are given theopportunity to study and work in Korea. Earlier in 2006, we introduced the Thu-Vien SK Telecomproject jointly with Global Civic Sharing to help develop the country
sseducational infrastructure.
Another major initiative of SK Telecom is providing free surgeries for Vietnamese children with facialdeformities carried out in conjunction with the Smile for Children since 1996. A total of 2,676 childrenhave benefitted from the surgeries through 2008. For its active CSR programs in the country whichcontinued even through difficult times, the Vietnamese government awarded SK Telecom with theOrder of Amicable Relations, the highest honor given to foreigners in June 2008.
Economic Contribution of Overseas Business
Leveraging its convergence service experience accumulated in Korea, SK Telecom aims to
contribute to advancing the global wireless communications market as a leading telecomoperator with in-depth knowledge and vast expertise in CDMA, WCDMA, TD-SCDMA and othertelecommunication service standards. By hiring locals under better conditions than our rivals inemerging markets like China and Vietnam, we are playing a major role in fostering the local talentpool of well-trained professionals.

philanthropic programs designed to expand welfare infrastructure and create jobs. Our key
initiatives include 1318 Happy Zone for underprivileged teens, Happy Doshirak Meal Service for
low income families and dispatch of teacher aides to help children with disabilities receive better
education. Through the Happy Doshirak Meal Service program, we deliver nutritious lunches to
children and seniors who are at risk of going hungry. Of the 29 provision centers operating across the
country, 18 attained the Labor Ministry sstsocial enterprise ucertification as of March 2009. Reflecting recent
economic conditions, we plan to open additional provisional centers to offer relief to more people in need.
Support for Underprivileged Y outh

Economic Performance
Stakeholder Return - Employees
SKTelecom has accumulated a sufficient amount of reserves for severance payments (outside
reserve ratio of 82.4% as of the end of 2008). We have negotiated with the labor union to introduce
the retirement pension where employees will be given the option of choosing between a defined
benefits plan and defined contribution plan. We will continue our efforts to find common ground with
the labor union on the issue, however, the timing of its introduction is still undetermined.
Stakeholder Return - Shareholders and Creditors
Between 2006 and 2008, SK Telecom repurchased company shares each year. Our goal is to find
the optimal balance between maintaining financial health and pursuing investments to drive growthand boost shareholder value.

Stakeholder Return - Local Community
Market Position
Major overseas invested firms of SK Telecom do not necessarily give priority to local firms when
making purchasing decisions. However, most of the supplies for the overseas subsidiaries areprocured from local firms and it is our principle to increase the ratio of local hires. Currently, localhires account for 55.4% (or 144 persons) of total employees at our four overseas corporations inkey regions. Especially in Vietnam and China, we offer more competitive wage and benefitpackages than our competitors to all local hires including fresh graduates.

SK Telecom closely monitors energy and water usage while taking an avid interest in
waste management and bio-diversity. We also consider the environmental impact ofusing company vehicles. As a mobile telecom service provider, our operations do notinvolve manufacturing products that directly use raw materials or processes that requirehazardous substances. We also do not generate ozone depleting substances or other
air pollutants. In 2008, no penalties were levied to the company for violatingenvironmental laws.
Energy and Climate Change
GHG Emissions
In2008, SK Telecom ssGHG emissions from energy use rose 8.7% from the previous year to
389,427 tons. The increase is believed to be due to expansion of our operations such as rise in the
number of employees and sales as well as building of additional base stations for 3G network
expansion. However, our energy saving campaign is paying off and we are seeing decreasing growth
rate in energy consumption from 14.0% in 2006 to 10.8% in 2007 and 8.7% in 2008. Amid growingimportance of GHG emissions control, we plan to overhaul the related measurement system andexpand the scope of energy target management currently applied to office buildings.

Energy saving actions such as introducing high-efficient air conditioners in office buildings, adjusting
room temperatures, turning off lights in unused spaces, managing cooling and heating systems afterwork hours and installing natural cooling systems in base stations led to a reduction of CO

Water
Water use management centers on office buildings. Despite water conservation drives such as
adjusting water pressure, we saw an increase in facility water usage as water coolant became
airborne due to increased power consumption. We will keep up efforts in saving resources by
incorporating environmental awareness as an integral part of our corporate culture in 2009.
Waste
Waste generated from each office building is recycled and reused as much as possible while
unrecyclable waste is disposed of following the proper procedure. Launching of an eco-office
campaign that included refraining use of disposables in the latter half of 2008 resulted insignificant reduction in waste. Our resource conservation actions will continue in 2009 withmonitoring of printer usage and avoiding use of paper cups.

share base stations when possible to protect the cityscape and environment. Accordingly, the
number of eco-friendly wireless stations rose by 12,584 in 2008 from the previous year. Over 50% of
new wireless stations to be built in 2009 will be eco-friendly.
Environmental Impact of Our Services
SK Telecom is working to minimize the impact mobile telecommunication service
has on our environment by standardizing peripheral devices, expanding e-billingand promoting used handset recycling.
Expansion of E-billing
In order to reduce the use of paper and other resource as well as mailing expenses, we are moving to
have more subscribers use e-billing services. Our plan is to expand the number to 8 million by takingour e-bills to the next level of convenience.
Product Recycling
Subsidies are being offered to customers who return their old handsets when they switch mobile
phone operators or change to a new handset. The priority is on reusing retrieved handsets, whilehandsets that are not reused are passed on to recycling companies that meet the standards set bythe Ministry of Environment or exported overseas through SK Networks. Offering of extra subsidieson used handsets led to an increase in handset retrievals by more than 1 million units in 2008compared to the previous year. Due to a drop in overseas demand, more handsets were sold todomestic recycling firms. Our goal for 2009 is to increase the number of retrieved handsets to 2.5million units. To this end, we plan to diversify partners for our handset return campaign and establish asystem that will allow customers to return unwanted handsets any time.Environmental Data Measuring Our Progress

for network maintenance and repair work (as of the end of 2008) .To minimize pollution caused by car
exhaust emissions, our policy stipulates that business partners use vehicles that comply with
Euro 4 standards. Accordingly, the ratio of cars that meet the standard among the entire fleet of
diesel engines operated by business partners rose to 34% in 2008. Our green action for 2009
includes switching leased cars that mostly run on gasoline to energy efficient compact cars. We
also plan to improve vehicle management to enable automatic calculation of GHG emissions
according to the travel distance. Meanwhile, we will increase the use of video conferencing systems
set up in 56 domestic and 3 overseas offices in 2008 to replace business trips.

Voice of Customers
SKTelecom operates the VOC(Voice of Customers) system to continuously monitor customers s
concerns and grievances and to make improvements as necessary. As a result, the number of
complaints filed against SK Telecom with external organizations such as the Korea
Communications Commission(KCC), Korea Consumer Agency and NGOs has been on a decline
since 2006. In 2008, the complaints lodged with KCC and NGOs dropped 39.3% and 12%,
respectively, year-on-year. 
Webelieve difficult economic times could lead to a rise in customer complaints in 2009.
Accordingly, we will set a specific goal to reduce number of complaints filed with KCC and focus
onindentifying and eliminating root causes of complaints in advance. Follow-up to customer
complaints will be handled by conflict specialists who we plan to nurture to arrange satisfactory
resolution.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity
Diversity and inclusion are essential to our culture and business success. Thus, there is no gender
gap in pay and promotions at SK Telecom. The average age of our female workforce is relatively
lower than that of their male counterparts, which can be attributed to the fact that men got a head
start in joining the workforce in Korea. This may explain why none of our board members are
female, and there are only three women (1.1%) in the 263 top posts. However, the proportion of
female employees is on the rise. Currently, women account for 13.5% of full-timers, 21.8% of the
entire workforce and 22.0% of new recruits, which should lead to an increased number of female
executives in the future. We also offer various support for employees to balance life and work.
These include various leaves including maternity leave and day-off for baby sshospital visits and
prenatal care, and facilities such as nursing room and nursery operations.
Labor-Management Relations
In line with the annual labor-management agreement, SK Telecom strives to ascertain that no
areas of work infringes on freedom of assembly and collective bargaining. Although annual unionmembership remains unchanged at roughly 80%, the proportion of union members in comparisonto overall full-timers are on the decline due to the rise in the ratio of supervisory roles.
Welfare Benefits
SK Telecom employees enjoy industry-leading benefits that include medical expenses, health check-
ups, maternity leaves, sabbatical leaves for long-term employees and self-development programs.Additional benefits such as scholarship for children and mortgage loans are offered as an incentive toinspire long service. In 2003, we set up an outside consultation program called 
tMy Counselor uto
offer professional support on a wide range of issues. The number of counseling cases totaled 461 in2008 on topics like health (295 cases), psychological problems (141) and finances (25).SK Telecom Sustainability Report 2008

Employee Health
Annual medical check-ups are offered to our full-time and contract employees, and their spouses
who are 35 years or older. Thanks to the company ssefforts to increase health awareness, more
people are taking advantage of the benefit. Those who receive below a certain grade in their check-
ups are subject to reexaminations and other supportive measures to improve their health.
Operation of Industrial Safety and Health Committee
Held four times a year, an equal number of labor and management representatives at the Industrial
Safety and Health Committee discuss issues at hand and their decisions are applied to all employees.The committee sets up workplace accidents prevention plan, surveys workplace accidents anddiscusses employee medical check-ups.
Employee Education
In 2008, the average training hours completed per manager were 107.1, a slight increase from
104.7 hours in 2007. Team leaders and above received training of 73.7 hours per person. Every
year, SK Telecom employees are required to draw up and carry out an tIndividual Development
Planuafter an assessment of individual skills. SK Telecom has established a new job competency
development program to provide employees with continued opportunities to grow and developtheir career through job training tailored to their tasks. Under the plan, we will nurture specialists inline with our long-term corporate strategy.
Career Management 
All employees are required to formulate individual KPI(Key Performance Indicator) before each
periodic evaluation through the tPeople Review and Coaching System. uThe outcome is reflected in
the personnel performance report. For efficient development and management of individual careerswithin the organization, we operate the
tJob-Person Fit System. uIn addition, a sabbatical leave
(Refresh Holiday) is offered to long service employees to help them rejuvenate and develop newcompetencies. For those who are retiring, we have programs to help them map out their post-retirement future and adapt to changes after SK Telecom.

SK Telecom strictly abides by regulations on forced and child labor set forth by the Korean
Labor Standard Act. We are committed to building a culture of ethics and integrity whereindividual rights are held in the highest esteem. Going forward, we will strive to extend ourcorporate culture beyond our walls to invested firms and business partners.
Investment and Supply Practice
SK Telecom conducts a comprehensive review of possible human rights violation in connection
with employees when assessing risks associated with investment agreement. Since joining theUN Global Compact in May 2005, we have been seeking ways to request our business partnersto take necessary steps to protect human rights. As a part of this endeavor, we incorporated theUN Global Compact
ssfour major principles as our guiding policy for new supplier registration in
the first half of 2009. Excluding minor contracts that occur at the departmental level, all businesspartners will be evaluated for their policies, processes and training programs on the environment,human rights and labor upon registration.
Human Rights Policy and Education
SK Telecom ssCode of Ethics stipulates employees sright to equal treatment and respect for each
other. All employees participate in regular education to understand and reinforce our ethicsexpectations. In addition, a sexual harassment class is held every year to teach employees aboutpreventing sexual harassment in the workplace. In 2008, the company rule was revised so that allsexual harassment cases are handled by the companywide personnel disciplinary committee.
Protecting Visitors sRights
To create a safe environment for everyone who visits our worksites in addition to our employees,
we conduct safety accident prevention and customer response procedure training for oursecurity personnel on a regular basis. As of the end of 2008, a total of 247 security personnelwere hired throughout our premises nationwide. Social Data

SK Telecom abides by the Political Fund Act which prohibits companies from providing
political funds. We pay attention to society ssdemands regarding anti-corruption and fair
competition, and engage in public policy efforts to create jobs and to promote genderequality and low-carbon growth. We work closely with local governments, NGOs andlocal residents to earn their support when executing a major project such as installingbase stations. We also work together with local communities in a number of community
involvement initiatives.
Anti-corruption
To achieve our goal of transparency and integrity, we conduct process-oriented audit activities as
well as EIRM (Ethical Issue Raising & Mapping) activities allowing employees to select and manage
ethical risks which may arise in general business activities. In 2008, a total of 64 teams werechosen to take part in EIRM activities. As concrete steps to elevate the importance of managing ethical risks, we offer extensive on- andoff-line training to our employees. Under the belief that the leadership plays a crucial role inmaintaining the highest standards of ethics and responsibility in our operations, the training isespecially focused on team leaders and above. In 2008, 23.6% of the entire staff and 40.0% ofleadership received ethics training. We plan to strengthen training and one-on-one interviews withthe leadership group to emphasize their responsibility of upholding a culture of integrity. We willalso map out education programs tailored to each division and job title in 2009. In the event of an ethics violation, the disciplinary committee is convened to deliberate and handdown an appropriate penalty. In 2008, two people 
(transaction with the company through a third-party such as
family members and acquaintances) received disciplinary action (above censure) ,adramatic fall from the
previous year, which is believed to be the result of strengthened company rules and emphasis onintegrity through continued education.
Observing Laws
SK Telecom sscommitment to full compliance of laws that govern every aspect of our operations
is underscored by an extensive system of policies, processes and training. In 2008, penaltieslevied by the Korea Communications Commission and Fair Trade Commission declined sharplyfrom the previous year to amount to KRW 2.15 billion for a total of three cases.

Independent Assurance
StatementAppendix

Independent
AssuranceStatementÂ  Scope and objectives Â SK Telecom commissioned Two Tomorrows (Europe) Limited to
undertake independent assurance of the Sustainability Report 2008.The assurance process was conducted in accordance with AA1000AS (2008). We wereengaged to provide Type 2 assurance, which covers:
Â evaluation of adherence to the AA1000APS (2008) principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness 
(the Principles) and;
Â the reliability of all data and key claims in the report except the financial information from annual report.
We used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Quality of Information Principles as Criteria for evaluating
performance information against tests for Reliability, Clarity, Balance, Comparability, Accuracy and Timeliness.Where GRI protocols were used to compile performance indicators, these were adopted as additional criteria.
Â Responsibilities of the directors of SK Telecom and of the assurance providers Â 
The directors of SK Telecom have sole responsibility for the preparation of the Report.  In performing our
assurance work, our responsibility is to the management of SK Telecom, however our statement represents
our independent opinion and is intended to inform all of SK Telecom stakeholders including the management
of SK Telecom.  
We were not involved in the preparation of any part of the Report.  We have no other contract with SK
Telecom and this is the first year that we have provided assurance.  We adopt a balanced approach towards
all SK Telecom stakeholders. 
Our team comprised Jason Perks, lead assuror, MinGu Jun, project leader, Thomas Krick and SangMook
Park.  Further information, including individual competencies relating to the team can be found at:
www.twotomorrows.com.
Â Basis of our opinion Â Our work was designed to gather evidence with the objective of providing
moderate assurance as defined in AA1000AS (2008). We undertook the following activities:
Â Review of previous report and preliminary identification of assurance priorities;
Â Review of the current sustainability issues that could affect SK Telecom and are of interest to stakeholders;
Â Interviews with selected vice presidents and senior managers responsible for management of sustainability issues 
and review of selected evidence to support issues discussed. We were free to choose areas of focus for interviews;
Â Review of SK Telecom approach to stakeholder engagement and recent outputs.
Â Review of information provided to us by SK Telecom on its reporting and management processes relating to the Principles ;
Â Site visits to head office to review process and systems for preparing sustainability data;
Â Review of supporting evidence for key claims in the report;
Â Review of the processes for gathering and consolidating data and, for a sample, checking the data consolidation and 
source information. Sampling was focussed on the most material data sets;
Â Anindependent assessment of SK Telecom Reporting against the B+ Application Level for the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) G3 Guidelines.
We have reviewed and assured the Korean and English language versions of the report and have not reviewed
or assured translations of this report into other languages.
Â Findings Â We reviewed and provided feedback on drafts of the Report and where necessary
changes were made. On the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the
Report does not properly describe SK Telecomâs adherence to the Principles or its performance.
In our opinion the report meets the GRI G3 application level B+.
Â Observations Â Without affecting our assurance opinion we also provide the following observations.
We commend the setting up of the Corporate Citizenship Committee as good practice in governance and
leading-edge practice in Korea. We also noted the involvement of external experts in the first meeting. Tofurther enhance this welcome development in the longer-term we recommend ensuring regular reporting to
the board, ongoing sustainability training and capacity building of the Corporate Citizenship Committeemembers, especially during personnel changes, to ensure the committee continues to build links with and
alignment to the core business strategy. This will also be assisted by ensuring clear areas of responsibility at
board level for CR issues.
SK Telecom Sustainability Report 2008

We generally noted that SK Telecom employees were aware of and integrated the overarching principle of the
company into their decision making â it would be helpful to see systematic monitoring of this in future.
Inclusivity concerns the participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and
strategic response to sustainability.
Â We were pleased to note an intention to set up a high level stakeholder link to the Corporate Citizenship Committee 
and recommend this includes representatives from key stakeholder groups.
Â SK Telecom recognises that engagement with NGOâs is at a preliminary stage. We noted an effective approach with 
the mobile social contribution programme. We agree that wider NGO engagement needs strengthening and this will be a challenge for SK Telecom given the limited capacity of many NGOs to engage effectively. We recommend SKT 
makes efforts to understand further who to engage with and why, and helps build capacity within the NGO community.
Â The report would benefit from a clearer explanation of the stakeholder engagement approach and how the feedback 
is integrated into company learning and decision making, especially through the SKMS.
Â With international growth plans, it will become increasingly important for SK Telecom to understand specific issues in 
each operating country and we recommend further engagement in each country to ensure the company is aware of 
any different issues or priorities.
Material issues are those which are necessary for stakeholders to make informed judgments
concerning SK Telecom and its impacts.
Â SKTelecom has developed a well-structured materiality process that is effectively communicated in the report.
Â The materiality process would benefit from the inclusion of SKMS outputs from various parts of the organisation 
where applicable â particularly in ensuring greater input from employees.
Â We noted that there was executive level risk-based review of material issues that was informally integrated into the 
materiality assessment. We recommend this be linked more systematically to the materiality process in future taking into account both risks and opportunities.
Â We recommend the materiality process be reviewed by the Corporate Citizenship Committee to enhance governance 
and ensure alignment between top management understanding of key issues and day to day management.
Responsiveness concerns the extent to which an organisation responds to stakeholder issues
Â There is an opportunity for HR to play a bigger role by assessing individualâs capacity and providing further 
sustainability training to ensure common understanding of broad issues and each individualsâ role (especially at higher levels of management) in delivering on SK Telecomâs sustainability strategy.
Â We encourage SK Telecom to disclose further its involvement in key external forums and how this is influencing 
progress on key sustainability issues.
Â SK Telecom has responded to widespread media coverage of high profile phone duplication. This raises a potential 
underlying question of whether SK Telecom information security is sufficiently robust. We recommend that further 
checking of related internal systems is an appropriate response to stakeholder concerns in this area. 
Performance Information
Â We recommend a more systematic information management approach for sustainability performance information, 
which is currently heavily reliant on manual and ad-hoc systems.
Â Currently SK Telecom is considering an environmental management system with some operational divisions already 
looking to implement specific systems to manage particular issues for their operations. We commend the recognition that there is a need to strengthen environmental management and recommend that a co-ordinated approach is taken, 
linked to the development of a company wide environmental policy and management system that focuses on the 
most significant environmental issues.
