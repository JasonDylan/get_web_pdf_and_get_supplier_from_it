Welcome Letter
from the President & CEO5Last year was one for the record books. We thrived in 2019, with record revenue of $17.7 billion. 
Looking back on the year, I see the hard work, dedication and ingenuity of our associates. We are 4,300 associates strong connected by our company’s guiding principles.

Although Jim Moran Boulevard may look a little different these days, our long-standing traditions of Consideration, Cooperation and Communication remain the same. These values, established by our founder Mr. Moran, along with Innovation and Accountability, represent a critical piece of our culture and will always lead us as we continue to explore new and innovative ways of doing business and sharing our collective success with others.

JM Family currently operates seven roof-top solar

In 2019, our solar arrays produced 749,506 kWh of 
clean, renewable energy. Consuming the same amount of electricity from non-renewable means would emit 355 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO
