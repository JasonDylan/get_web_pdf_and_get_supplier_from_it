SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  •2CO.,INC.CHURCH&DWIGHTSUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  •3CO.,INC.CHURCH&DWIGHTChurch & Dwight is a top-tier consumer products company and has been a friend of the environment throughout its history. Our products have been a standard of quality and environmental responsibility since 1846. As far back as 1888, we supported educational programs on wildlife conservation to expand public awareness. Beginning in the early 20th century, we advocated for the use of recycled paperboard in our product packaging. We were the only corporate sponsor of the ﬁrst Earth Day. We introduced the ﬁrst phosphate-free laundry detergent in the United States in the early 1970’s and, in 2009, we designed and built a state-of-the-art liquid laundry manufacturing plant in the United States achieving a LEED silver certiﬁcation.We are a good corporate citizen and earn the trust and loyalty of our consumers by offering highly effective and safe products. For example, in 2015, our ARM & HAMMER™ BioEnzyme Power Liquid Laundry Detergent earned the Safer Choice designation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We manufacture our products with an eye toward protecting the environment and respecting human rights and working conditions. We operate in many parts of the United States and abroad following Guiding Principles that reﬂect our commitment to internationally recognized standards for human rights, protection of the environment, and worker safety. We require our suppliers to follow our lead and follow the same Guiding Principles. We support the communities where we work and live. Our Employee Giving Fund is a nonproﬁt organization which supports local charitable organizations. The Giving Fund provides a means to ﬁnancially assist those who are less fortunate and actively support and participate in the good works of the charitable organizations. In 2015, the Giving Fund awarded more than $1.2 million to 179 organizations. Church & Dwight has ambitious goals and we attract talented people who share our values to join our Company. We are committed to sustainability and seek opportunities to reduce energy and water consumption at our manufacturing plants and promote recycling efforts throughout the organization.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  •7CO.,INC.CHURCH&DWIGHTSUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCEAs our product portfolio has become more diverse and the sustainability issues we face more complex, our sustainability governance is evolving to become more collaborative and cross-functional. To ensure sustainability is integrated into all parts of our business and to drive continual improvement in our sustainability approach and performance, in 2016, we established a Corporate Issues Council. The Council, which is comprised of senior leaders representing functional areas across the enterprise, is taking the lead in deﬁning, evolving, and implementing our sustainability strategies concerning ingredients, packaging, environmental impacts, and human rights and labor conditions in our operations and supply chain. Its duties include ensuring that we engage with stakeholders; monitor, prioritize, and address evolving standards and stakeholder requirements; allocate resources to appropriately address sustainability issues; and report on progress. PRODUCT CARE®Church & Dwight is a member of Product Care®, the Consumer Specialty Products Association’s (CSPA) product stewardship program. Through Product Care®, Church & Dwight participates in training sessions and mentor relationships with other member companies. Together with CSPA we are currently developing industry-wide management principles across seven product life cycle areas, ranging from product design  to anticipated disposal needs.
RESPONSIBLE CARE®Through our Specialty Products Division (SPD) Specialty Chemicals Group, we actively participate in Responsible Care®, the American Chemistry Council’s voluntary program to help companies improve their environmental; health and safety; and security performance beyond U.S. environmental and safety regulations and standards. SPD applies the Responsible Care Management System (RCMS): a structured approach to improving company performance in community awareness and emergency response; security; distribution; employee health and safety; pollution prevention; and process and product safety. In 2015 our SPD corporate operations in Princeton, NJ underwent a third-party audit that conﬁrmed and recertiﬁed its adherence with the RCMS technical standards.  STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTWe maintain an ongoing dialogue with a diverse group of stakeholders to communicate our sustainability progress and challenges and listen to feedback. We engage through multiple channels, including this report, our ﬁlings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, our website, one-on-one communications, and, starting in 2016, our CDP disclosure. We also connect with stakeholders through industry groups and coalitions, including the following.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  •8CO.,INC.CHURCH&DWIGHTFOUR-STEP SAFETY ASSURANCE PROCESSOUR PRODUCTS
At the same time, we make certain that our products are safe for consumer use and for the environment. At a minimum, this includes ensuring our products and the processes by which they are manufactured align with regulations and standards,  including relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certiﬁcations  (e.g., ISO 9001:2008 for non-medical device products and ISO 13485:2003 for medical devices). PRODUCT SAFETY We have strict policies and procedures in place to ensure our products and packaging are safe for consumer use. And with the guidance of toxicologists, trade associations, and external scientiﬁc experts, we actively monitor the latest science on any emerging chemicals of risk. Based on this guidance, as warranted, we develop action plans to remove chemicals of concern present in any Church & Dwight product. 
INGREDIENT SELECTION Evaluate the safety of each ingredient at its proposed concentration level, using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Design for the  Environment Safer Ingredients list as a benchmarkINGREDIENT TESTING Determine and test  potential human exposure  to the proposed ingredients under normal use and  reasonably foreseeable misuse PRE-MARKET ASSESSMENT Assess the ﬁnished product to ensure that all safety  criteria are met prior to manufacture and prior to shipment to customersPOST-MARKET EVALUATION Conduct post-market  surveillance and gather customer and consumer feedback Our ultimate goal is to delight our customers and consumers with high-quality, affordable products.  We endeavor to do this by continually challenging ourselves to identify and develop products with new  and distinctive features that meet ever-changing consumer needs and preferences. 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  •9CO.,INC.CHURCH&DWIGHTFragrance and Flavor SafetyFragrances and ﬂavors are important to our consumers, so we take care to tailor our products to consumer preferences, while also scrupulously assuring that all ingredients used to create these attributes are safe. We design all fragrance mixtures to comply with the safety standards set by the International Fragrance Association and all ﬂavor mixtures to those of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We also conduct comprehensive safety reviews on all fragrances used, based on expected patterns of consumer use. Additionally, we specially manufacture mild and fragrance-free products for consumers with sensitive skin.       PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL  SUSTAINABILITYFrom the earliest design stages to the end of consumer use, we explore ways to make improvements to the environmental sustainability of our product formulation and packaging. We partner closely with our suppliers to identify and execute these improvements. Today, much of our product packaging is made from post-consumer recycled materials and virtually all of our packaging is recyclable. In 2016, we will be making changes to some of our packaging to increase the percentage of post-consumer recycled materials used. PRODUCT DISCLOSUREWe devote signiﬁcant attention and care to transparently disclosing key ingredient and safety information for our products. The safety information for nearly all of our products is available on our website.We also disclose the ingredients of our cleaning and deodorizing products on our website in accordance with the Consumer Product Ingredient Communication Initiative. 
SAFER CHOICE PARTNERSHIP In 2015, Church & Dwight’s ARM & HAMMER™ BioEnzyme Power Liquid Laundry Detergent was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Safer Choice label – a seal of approval that marks the product as a leader in environmental safety. As the U.S. EPA expands the Safer Choice program to more product categories, we will look to earn this certiﬁcation for additional products. 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  •10CO.,INC.CHURCH&DWIGHTOUR EMPLOYEES
Church & Dwight regularly conducts an employee engagement survey. The 2015 survey, which had a nearly 90% response rate, showed strong levels of engagement and provided important data to allow leaders across the company to understand how to drive greater engagement within their respective functions. A cross-company theme that emerged from the 2015 survey was a desire for more training and development opportunities. We conducted additional employee research to determine the type of resources needed. INSTITUTE FOR  SUSTAINABLE ENTERPRISE Church & Dwight is a sponsor of the Institute for Sustainable Enterprise (ISE) at Fairleigh Dickinson University, Silberman College of Business. ISE brings professionals together to learn how to make their organizations environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable. Through our sponsorship, Church & Dwight employees participate in ISE seminars and networking events to share their knowledge and learn from peers at other companies committed to responsible operations and corporate citizenship.Based on the outcomes of that research, in 2016 and beyond we will launch enhanced offerings that include new online and ofﬂine courses and learning opportunities, including programs speciﬁcally targeted to middle managers to help them grow their skills and careers at Church & Dwight. These new opportunities complement an existing training catalogue of more than 1,000 online and in-person courses, our tuition reimbursement program, and our enterprise-wide commitment to provide  on-the-job training. The power behind our products is our more than 4,400 employees. We strive to hire the right people for the right jobs to take our company to ever higher levels of ﬁnancial and sustainability performance. We take pride in cultivating a corporate culture that values collaboration, honesty, accountability, respect,  and continuous learning.SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  •11CO.,INC.CHURCH&DWIGHTOUR OPERATIONS
GOVERNANCE AND ETHICSThe Church & Dwight Board of Directors, which in 2015 consisted of nine directors, eight of whom were independent, oversees and is ultimately accountable for Church & Dwight operations, strategy, performance, governance, and compliance with ethical and legal standards. In January 2016, newly appointed CEO Matt Farrell joined the Board as the 10th director. Every Church & Dwight employee is responsible for performing his or her duties with the highest ethical integrity. Our expectations of employees are detailed in our Code of Conduct, on which all employees receive mandatory training at a minimum of every two years. Employees also receive additional training on anti-harassment, anti-bribery, anti-trust, data privacy and security, and other compliance topics, as applicable, to ensure that all dealings and relationships are conducted in alignment with our Code, policies, and applicable legal standards.  Any violations of the Code, policies, or laws are required to be reported to the appropriate personnel or the Church & Dwight Ethics Hotline. The Hotline is hosted and maintained by an independent third party and all concerns may be submitted anonymously. All concerns reported through the Hotline are reviewed by the Ethics Committee, consisting of our General Counsel, Director of Internal Audit, and the head of global Human Resources, investigated under their oversight, and reported to the Audit Committee of our Board.  SUPPLY CHAINOur supply chain is a signiﬁcant part of our business and more than half of Church & Dwight employees support its day-to-day operations. We directly source from approximately 600 suppliers, the majority of which are located in North America. All of our suppliers are expected to comply with our Global Operations Guiding Principles, which were developed based on the principles of internationally recognized human rights and labor conditions and reﬂect our commitment to sustainable operations. We conduct risk-based supplier audits against ISO Quality Standards and Food Safety Standards. Audits are conducted by our Quality Department and supplemented, as needed, by independent third parties. Moving forward, we plan to perform risk-based assessments of our supply chain, supported by an audit, corrective action, and reporting framework, to ensure compliance with our Global Operations Guiding Principles.Palm OilWe recognize the negative impacts palm oil production can have on the environment and human rights. While Church & Dwight does not directly buy or use palm oil or palm kernel oil in our products, we do use ingredients derived from palm oil and palm kernel oil in products including liquid laundry detergents, gummy vitamins, animal feed products, oral care products, and feminine care products. We are committed to working toward sourcing only sustainable palm oil derivatives and are working with our suppliers toward the goal Our commitment to responsible operations is the bedrock of our sustainability approach. By upholding high ethical standards, continually reducing our environmental impact, creating a safe workplace, and vigilantly maintaining our commitment to responsible sourcing, we have held our position as a trusted provider of household, personal care, and specialty products for 170 years. 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  •12CO.,INC.CHURCH&DWIGHTof ensuring that the ingredients used in our products are from responsible sources. An estimated 96% of the palm oil derivatives we use are traceable to mills and we seek to achieve full traceability to mills by 2020. In addition to full traceability to mills, we support and encourage our primary supplier to achieve as much traceability to the plantations as possible and to comply with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil standards as they evolve.Conﬂict MineralsWe are committed to ensuring that our products do not contain conﬂict minerals that have funded armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. Any supplier found to be in violation of our policies is subject to corrective action, which may include termination of business.MANAGING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND SAFETYIt is essential for us to make great products and to produce them in facilities with robust environmental, health, and safety performance. We work toward this high-performance  culture through the following approach: Accountability – Each Church & Dwight facility has a designated on-site environmental and safety coordinator responsible for monitoring and managing environmental and safety issues affecting their facility. These coordinators are closely networked together to enable peer mentorship and best practice sharing  across facilities.Audits – Every Church & Dwight facility undergoes a third-party conducted safety audit each year and a third-party conducted environmental audit every other year. Awareness – We offer regular training for all Church & Dwight employees to promote awareness of environmental and safety 
practices and procedures. This includes an annual Church & Dwight Environmental and Safety Conference for facility environmental and safety coordinators. Awards – In 2015, we recognized our  Vancouver, WA plant for its exemplary  environmental and safety practices that resulted in a 58% reduction in general waste sent to landﬁll, a 12% increase in the plant’s safety audit score, and an 80% decrease in workers’ compensation costs.  WORKPLACE SAFETYChurch & Dwight is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees and visitors to our facilities.The most important measure we use to evaluate our safety performance is our “Days Away, Restricted, or Transferred” (DART) rate. In 2015, our DART rate increased slightly over 2014 levels, but still remained well below the industry benchmark. CHURCH & DWIGHT DART RATESRecordable Incidents/100 FTE2.21.62.21.21.32.2

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  •13CO.,INC.CHURCH&DWIGHTENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITYOur business has nearly doubled in the past 14 years – and we anticipate growth to continue in the coming years. Our aim is to disassociate business growth from growth in our environmental footprint. To manage this, we have a strong environmental policy in place and we are taking decisive action across the company to optimize our operations.  All facilities undergo periodic, unannounced inspections by federal, state, and local environmental agencies. In 2015, there were 26 such inspections conducted, which resulted in three minor environmental citations related to wastewater. One of the citations resulted in a $250 penalty. Corrective actions were immediately implemented for all three instances.We also monitor for and report on releases to the environment. This includes monitoring our Colonial Heights, VA plant, which, as a result of the manufacturing process, releases ammonia to the atmosphere on a consistent basis each year. While these releases are in compliance with air pollution control regulations, Church & Dwight is evaluating alternatives to ammonia-based technologies in order to limit the releases. We had one minor reportable accidental release in 2015 involving a wastewater tank overﬂow at our York, PA plant. The release was promptly reported to the state environmental regulatory agency. Immediate clean up actions were taken and corrective measures were put in place to prevent such releases in the future. Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas  (GHG) EmissionsIn 2014, we set a goal to reduce our GHG emissions by 20%, normalized to million pounds of product shipped, by 2025, using 2013 as a baseline. The GHG goal, which includes emissions from both our operations and shipping, equates to a reduction of more than 17 tons of CO2e per million pounds of product shipped. In 2014 and 2015, we assessed a number of our facilities for opportunities to reduce energy usage and associated CO2 emissions. As a result, seven GHG reduction projects were initiated involving equipment and system upgrades at ﬁve production locations, including a lighting upgrade project at our Colonial Heights, VA plant, which led to an approximate 4% reduction in total electricity usage for that facility. Our absolute GHG emissions were up approximately 7.2% in 2015 over 2014 and our net energy consumption was up approximately 4%, largely due to the acquisition of two new operating facilities, a facility expansion, and an increase in products shipped during the year. Absent the new facilities, our net energy consumption would have been down approximately 3.6% over 2014. We are in the process of reviewing and ﬁnalizing a roadmap to achieve our 2025 GHG goal. While the roadmap will include additional efﬁciency projects at plants, these improvements alone cannot produce the 20% reduction. We will also be looking to increase our renewable energy use, our investment in offsets, and our use of more energy efﬁcient shipping options. 85.284.286.8Energy Intensity (tons of CO2/MM pounds of product shipped)

10K20K30K40K50K60K70K80KNon-Hazardous WasteWaterBecause water is a main ingredient in several of our products, water conservation and management is a particularly high priority. In 2015, our water intake was up 10.5% over 2014 and net water consumption (water used as an ingredient, consumed in process, or lost to evaporation) up 11%. The increased water intake is largely attributable to three locations that substantially increased their production volumes.  As we continue to increase production, we are actively exploring ways to 
WasteIn 2015, our waste generation increased signiﬁcantly primarily due to the acquisition of two new operating facilitates and the opening of a new manufacturing facility for vitamin and mineral supplements. As with water, we are continually exploring ways to reduce waste as we increase production. For example, in our Montreal location in 2015, we implemented a corrugate box reuse program that enabled the reuse of 38 tons of corrugate for a total savings of 195 tons of CO2e. In 2016 and beyond, we will look for opportunities to apply this and other promising programs across the enterprise. avoid corresponding increases in water consumption. For example, in 2015, we implemented several water optimization projects, including:• Steam condensate recovery and reuse efforts at our Camacari, Brazil plant,  resulting in a 6% reduction in water intake over 2014• Data monitoring and water conservation practices at our Colonial Heights, VA plant, resulting in a 9% reduction in process water consumption over 2014
WASTE VOLUMES TonsTHE ROLE OF PRODUCT  FORMULATION IN EMISSIONS One of the biggest contributors to  our carbon footprint is shipping.  The energy requirements to ship some of our heavier products – such as liquid laundry detergent – can be particularly intensive. By considering product weight at the design stage, we have an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions in shipping. For instance, our ARM & HAMMER™  plus OxiClean™ Laundry Detergent Power Paks were designed to use  a fraction of the water of liquid laundry detergents, which exponentially reduces the product’s weight, allowing for less energy intensive shipping.

EMPLOYEE  GIVING FUNDIn 2005, we established the Church & Dwight Employee Giving Fund, Inc. (EGF), a workplace giving and volunteerism program that supports charitable organizations in our headquarters communities in New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania. Since then, EGF has become a cherished part of Church & Dwight’s culture. In 2015, EGF’s 10th anniversary year, more than 60% of headquarters employees participated in the fund either through giving or volunteering, with an average contribution per participating employee of nearly $1,400.    Employee GivingEach November, we invite employees to dedicate a portion of their paychecks to the EGF. Employees who participate at high levels are rewarded with additional time off and all contributions are matched dollar for dollar by the company – with no cap. In addition to payroll deductions, we conduct workplace drives and fundraisers year-round, including the highly successful EGF online auction, which raised more than $22,000 in 2015. In 2016, we will also be opening a company store at our Ewing, NJ headquarters, the proﬁts of which will go entirely to the EGF.Part of working in a community is supporting that community. We are dedicated to working together to strengthen the communities where we operate.
In 2015, the fund awarded more than $1.2 million to 179 organizations supporting disaster relief, animal rescue, disadvantaged youth, domestic violence, education, health, homelessness, hunger relief, military services, preservation of the environment, services for the elderly, and the visual and performing arts. Employee Volunteerism Church & Dwight employees regularly volunteer with EGF grantee organizations. Each June, we host a Week of Service during which all employees are invited to participate in company-sponsored service opportunities. Our 2015 Week of Service projects included supporting the Jewish Family and Children’s Service of Greater Mercer County “stock and shop” program for the Kosher Food Pantry; serving dinner at the Trenton Area Soup Kitchen; and helping construct a new Kidsbridge Tolerance Center in Ewing, NJ to provide local kids with a dynamic space for afterschool activities. At the culmination of the week in 2015, we hosted our ﬁrst EGF Organization Showcase at Church & Dwight headquarters, during which EGF grantees were invited to share information on their organizations and educate employees on more ways to get involved.
