  Message from the Chairman
I.Operating Environment
In 2020, the supply and demand of transportation were greatly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic around 
the globe. As the pandemic remained uncertain, governments restrict transportation to prevent it from 
spreading, while traders and shippers mostly adopt a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a severe 
impact on the demand of the dry bulk shipping market. Therefore, the bulk shipping market was sluggish
in the first half of the year, which also affected chartering and vessel sales and purchases. However, 
amid the global economic downturn, the low oil price also enabled a stable transition to low sulphur 
fuel oil for vessels.
In the second half of the year, industrial investment and production activities, which were suspended 
by various countries, gradually resumed. As a result, in the second half of the year, the dry bulk shipping
market gradually stabilized, while time charter and freight forwarding markets rebounded. The overall 
BDI has not returned to 2019 levels, but the market momentum that is gradually building up is still a 
positive sign for the dry bulk shipping industry.
Despite the rebound of the dry bulk shipping market in the second half of 2020, investment in new vessels
remained low and the total number of new vessel orders for all vessel types is even lower than in 2019. 
Considering the pressure of phasing out old vessels over 20 years old, the dry bulk vessel market still 
sees a potential supply shortage in the future. Moreover, the progress of the UN’s shipping-related
environmental regulations has not slowed down due to the pandemic. Regulations related to carbon 
reduction may lead to a further increase in the operating cost of old vessels in the coming three to five 
years. Therefore, in the medium term, the supply and demand of dry bulk shipping still provide
fundamental support for the freight level.
II.2020 Business Performance
During the year, the number of vessels in our fleet recorded a net increase of 7, totaling 136 at the end 
of the year.
In 2020, as the Company intended to take advantage of the imbalance between supply and demand to 
increase profitability, therefore, the number of ships with contract renewal and index linked hire was 
higher in the first quarter compared to previous years. However, due to the market volatility as a result 
of the pandemic, we suffered from poor revenue and profitability in the first half of the year. As the 
economy recovered in the second half of the year and the adoption of a more conservative operating 
strategy, our profitability rebounded and gross margin improved from 7.64% in the first half of the year 
to 19.07% in the second half of the year. The gross margin for the year was 13.88% and total revenue 
was US$405.1million, representing a decrease of 9.47% compared to last year. Net operating income 
for the year was approximately US$51 million and net profit after tax was approximately US$4 million.
Ⅲ.2021 Business Plan
The Company expects to have 7 newbuildings delivered in 2021, including two 
Kamsarmax, one Supramax, three Handysize and one LPG carrier, all built by leading
Japanese shipbuilders such as Imabari, JMU, Namura, Tsuneishi, Onomichi and
Murakami Hide. In particular, 3 of which are environment-friendly ships complied
with the Tier III NOx emission standards.
The vessel disposal plan, which was suspended in 2020 due to the pandemic,
is expected to continue in 2021 to enhance the overall operational efficiency
of the fleet and improve the financial structure. At the same time, the Company
will closely monitor regulatory changes and evaluate capital expenditure 
plans accordingly to ensure its fleets can be competitive while being
environmentally friendly and energy- saving.

In 2015, the UN proposed 17 Sustainable Development Goals ( SDG s) consisting of 169 detailed goals, 
which will serve as a reference for global sustainable development in the next 15 years 
(2016~203 0). Referring to the “ Integrating the SDGs into corporate reporting: A practical guid e”

(2) consideration, and ( 3) reporting and action. Wisdom then combined such issues with its sustainable
development strategies to integrate sustainable operation into its business. Lastly, the results were 
disclosed and reviewed in this Report to contribute to SDGs step by step.

2020 Wisdom Marine Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report
 1About Wisdom1.4.1 Climate-related Financial Information Disclosure
In accordance with the recommendations from TCFD, the Company assessed the climate-related risks, 
opportunities and financial impacts and conducted analyses with reference to the TCFD framework:
AThe Company ’s Board of Directors is responsible for formulating the 
Group ’s business strategy, and the Chairman is responsible for 
overseeing the implementation of the strategy and incorporating the 
impact of climate issues on the Group into the business strategy for 
comprehensive consideration. A CSR Committee is established under the 
Board of Directors to coordinate the Company ’s risks, strategies and 
actions on climate-related issues, report to the Board of Directors and 
prepare the Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
The Company ’s ISM Department is responsible for keeping track of 
international regulations related to climate and formulating compliance 
guidelines, which are incorporated into the vessel safety management 
system or sent to each vessel and related departments. The management 
also discusses climate-related risks and regulations through monthly 
supervisory meetings. Each department also designates members to 
participate in the CSR Committee to discuss climate-related issues.Governance
DIn assessing the short-term physical risks related to climate, the Company 
conducts a comprehensive assessment and case review of the overall 
fleet operating days lost, and analyzes whether the proportion of climate 
factors is on the rise. The Company also keeps track of and evaluates the 
potential impact of changes in vessel construction costs and equipment 
costs caused by changes in regulations.
The Company adopts EEDI, which is in line with the International Convention, 
as its quantitative indicator for managing climate risks. The Company will 
also introduce indicators, such as EEXI and CII, evaluating the climate 
risks of existing vessels. In addition, the Company will continue to keep 
track of the energy consumption and emissions of its fleet, which will be 
disclosed in the CSR report.
The specific targets for each indicator will be initially set in compliance 
with regulations, which will then be reviewed to further reduce the 
environmental impact by increasing investment in new vessels and modifying 
vessel equipment.Metrics
and Targets
With regard to the identification, evaluation and management of climate-
related risks, the Company adopts different approaches depending on 
the nature of the risks. These risks are discussed and evaluated by 
representatives of relevant departments at supervisory meetings and the 
CSR Committee and then reported to the Board of Directors.
It is hard to say that operational risks are caused by climate factors, as 
accidents and delays may also be caused by crew operations, machinery 
maintenance, or solely weather. However, through the review and inventory
of accidents by the Business & Operation Department and ISM Department,
the Company may still estimate the climate impact from the trends of 
accidents.
The risk of climate regulatory transition is mainly related to the progress of
the implementation of international regulations. The Technical Department
and ISM Department will review the compliance methods and costs 
together with external consultants and Ship’s Classification Societies. 
However, due to the risk of price changes as a result of the implementation 
of regulations, as well as many other factors that affect the cost of 
shipbuilding, it is still difficult to assess new buildings individually.
As for the impact of climate issues on customers, capital market, banks 
and brand value, it depends on the continuous communication between 
relevant departments and stakeholders. The Company’s short-term  
operational risks are managed by the ISM Department and the Business 
& Operation Department. Medium and long-term risks, which affect 
vessel investment decisions and the Company’s business strategy, are 
considered by the Board of Directors, which will formulate a comprehensive 
plan accordingly.Risk

to have a lower impact on the Company compared to other companies in 
the industry. However, there is no appropriate tool to assess the specific

 1About Wisdom 1.5 Economic Performance
Management Approach
AThe Company’s management objective for economic performance is to 
create stable operating income, operating profit margin and operating 
cash flow for its repayment and operating expenses, as well as to generate 
long-term and stable income for shareholders.Purpose
BThe Company’s economic performance management policy is supported 
by a business model that focuses on time charters and supplemented
by spot market business to keep track of the latest market development 
and flexibly adjust contract arrangements. The Company also selects 
charterers with a good reputation to reduce the risk of default. At the 
same time, with an operating fleet consisted mainly of Eco ships, the 
Company is able to establish long-term and sustainable partnerships 
with business partners.Policy
DOur long-term financial performance serves as an indicator for evaluating 
economic performance. The Company’s operating model can reduce the 
impact in times of economic downturn. We can also sign favorable 
charter parties in a timely manner in case of a rebound, which is in line 
with the goal of maintaining stable revenue. In recent years, the average 
gross operating margin of the long-term charter parties signed by the 
Company for Eco ships is about 40%, which is more competitive than 
conventional ships. Under the impact of the pandemic, the average gross 
operating margin of the eight new Eco ships added into the fleet in 2020 
was approximately 35%, contributing approximately US$19.0 million to 
the revenue. The current management policy for economic performance 
is still operating smoothly, there is no plan for adjustment.Evaluation

of 7. At the end of the year, the total number of the vessel was 136.
In 2020, as the Company intended to take advantage of the imbalance between supply and demand to 
increase profitability, the number of vessels that have renewed contract and rental in the first quarter 
compared to previous years. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company was hit by greater 
market volatility and recorded low revenue and profitability in the first half of the year. Fortunately, the 
average gross profit of newbuildings is still close to 40%, which is contributable to the overall profitability. 
As the economy recovered in the second half of the year and the adoption of a more conservative operating 
strategy, our profitability rebounded and gross margin improved from 7.64% in the first half of the year 
to 19.07% in the second half of the year. The gross margin for the year was 13.88% and total revenue 
was US$405.1 million, representing a decrease of 9.47% compared to last year.
In terms of non-operating income, there was no non-operating income in 2020. However, interest 
expense was lower than the previous year by US$16.1 million and foreign exchange loss was US$8.3 
million due to the appreciation of the Japanese yen. Net operating income for the year was approximately 
US$51 million and net profit after tax was approximately US$4 million.
In 2020, in response to the uncertainty of COVID-19 and to ease the cash flow pressure arising from 
asset disposal, the Company received support from several major banks to lower repayment amounts, 
adjust interest rates. The Company also increased cash capital in the middle of the year to enhance its 
financial stability in response to market changes.

Wisdom manages its fleets through crew safety, ship safety, and cargo safety. In terms of crew and 
ship safety, Wisdom conducts training and strictly complies with international conventions to reduce 
the number of deficiencies during Port State Control inspections and increase the safety awareness 
of the fleets. In terms of cargo safety, Wisdom strictly complies with international regulations and 
reviews incidents to reduce cargo damage.
To ensure ship safety and pollution prevention, the International Maritime Organization ( IMO) has 
formulated international conventions as shown in the following table. To ensure the ships comply with 
the requirements of international conventions, the Classification Society also arranges regular inspections
and issues inspection reports and certificates.
International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution
from Ships, MARPOL
International Safety Management Code, ISM Code
Maritime Labour Convention 2006, MLC 2006
International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, ISPS Code
3.1.1 Port State Control Inspection
To enhance the degree of management, the IMO authorized port states to establish a Port State Control
(PSC). PSC can conduct safety inspections on ships at the port. In the case of a violation, the inspection
officer will issue a deficiency report and request improvements and review preventive measures. In the 
case of a major violation, the port state may even detain the ship until the violation is resolved before 
it is allowed to leave the port.
Port states in different regions have established organizations similar to alliances to strengthen their 
inspection efficiency and standardize inspection standards. For example, the Tokyo MOU in Asia 
covers 20 port states in the Asia-Pacific region while the Paris MOU covers mainly EU member states. 
An inspection database is shared within the organization. The historical inspection records of ships in 
the area will be recorded in the database. Therefore, different port states can effectively track the past 
deficiency records, which can be revisited to confirm that the ships have conducted improvements 
accordingly.Wisdom fleet’s performance in Port State Control inspections and the standards of the Tokyo MOU
in 2020 are set out in the following table. For each inspection on the Wisdom fleet in port states, an
average of 1.96 deficiencies was identified and the detention rate was 4.1%, which is a slight
improvement compared to 2019. Our performance is maintained at a medium level. The non-
deficiency rate in 2020 increased by 3.1% compared with 2019. The average deficiency increased by 
approximately 0.14 and the detention rate increased by 2%. With regard to the inspection in 2020, due 
to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions in ports around the world, the replacement of 
seafarers was difficult. As a result, the crew is not able to take regular shifts, which have led to physical 
and mental fatigue, as well as a decrease in concentration during work, indirectly increasing the 
deficiency in inspections.

2020 Wisdom Marine Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 3Shipping Planning and Management
Wisdom is committed to ensuring smooth operation of the ship’s safety management system. Circulars, 
ship inspection checklists, and other precautions are sent to the Captain of each vessel. Self-inspection 
is completed during voyages to pass the inspection smoothly after arriving at the port and avoid 
detention due to major deficiencies.
Self-inspection preparation process:The necessary on board disaster prevention and rescue equipment in the event of disasters include 
(but not limited t o) the following:
3.1.2 Safety drill training
As ship voyages involve many unpredictable factors, the prevention of marine accidents and emergency
procedures in the event of disasters are important issues. Wisdom’s vessel structure, safety equipment,
drills and training plans, and emergency procedures are compliant with regulations. Staff safety, ship 
safety, and cargo safety have always been our top priority.
Wisdom formulates drill and training plans in accordance with SOLAS. Each ship conducts eight drills 
and four trainings with an average of over 20 hours per month and approximately 240 hours per year.
There are 18 types of ship safety drills, including helicopter rescue, underwater rescue, confined space 
rescue, abandon-ship drills, power, engine, and equipment failures, ship collisions, cabin flooding, and 
others. With such safety drills, seafarers can familiarize themselves with emergency procedures in the 
event of accidents to minimize injuries and losses.3.1.3 Ship Security
Since the 911 incident, ships have also been included in the list of vehicles that may be used by 
terrorists in terrorist attacks. Therefore, the IMO formulated the International Ship and Port Facility 
Security Code ( ISPS Cod e), under which all ships sailing on international routes must establish a Ship 
Security Plan, providing ship security plans and guidelines, security drills, and training.
The drills and training planned by Wisdom include bombs, pirate attacks, stowaways, etc. which allow 
seafarers to take the right action and minimize damage when encountering external threats. In addition,
for Somalia and high-risk areas nearby, where pirate attacks are rampant, Wisdom and ship charterers 
hire armed guards to ensure safe voyages.

2. Stowaway prevention:
 Wisdom has formulated a standard procedure in the Ship Security Plan to prevent stowaways. We
 provide a “ stowaway prevention bonu s” to encourage seafarers to conduct strict boarding control and
 thorough search and inspection before sailing to reduce stowaway incidents. In the event of stowaways,
 Wisdom will issue a circular explaining the incident and preventive measures. We also urge seafarers
 to strictly implement security measures to enhance the fleets’ awareness of preventing stowaways.
3. Related incidents and countermeasures:
 Wisdom avoids thefts and stowaways with security drills, training, and preventive measures. However,
 there were still two thefts and one stowaway in 2020. After investigation, the two thefts were in Peru
 and Brazil. After the incident, the Captain has arranged additional staff on patrol or duty regularly
 at night time. The stowaway was in the port of Durban, South Africa. The ship left the port and was
 heading to Singapore, during the voyage, two stowaways were found on the left wing of the bridge,
 their original hiding place is unknown. The ship then returned to Durban port to return the stowaways.
 In order to avoid the same incident from happening again, the Company has once again instructed
 the Captain to fully search the ship before sailing.Protection of material cabins
Cabin doors of all storage rooms, paint rooms, and material rooms on the 
ship must be locked. Valuable belongings must be placed in locked cabins. 
Equipment in lifeboats and life-saving equipment on the deck may also be 
stored in cabins if required, which shall be returned to their original positions
immediately after departure.
Patrol
Patrols shall be fully equipped with security equipment, work in pairs, 
and communicate with the Chief Officer on duty. Any suspicious activity 
identified must be reported immediately.
Illumination
The bow, sides, and deck lights must be turned on. The daylight signal on 
the ship must be used as an additional illuminating tool. At the same time, 
the deputy captain on duty must illuminate the surroundings from time to 
time with searchlights to prevent suspicious boats from getting close.
Communication
When under attack by pirates or armed robbers, immediately report to the 
local search and rescue center. When sailing in a high-risk area, maintain 
radio communication with the shore security and listen to the maritime safety 
broadcast in the area to stay updated with the latest security information.
Additional security measures
Having considered the risks in the area, the Captain may report to the 
Company and request for security guards on the ship.

 3.2 Cargo Shipping Quality
Management Approach
AThe purpose of our transportation quality management is to ensure the 
quality, quantity, and delivery time of shipped cargoes.Purpose
BThe Company strictly complies with shipping regulations when loading 
cargo to ensure that the vessel is suitable for loading. We formulate cargo 
allocation and lashing plans and confirm the quality of the cargo before 
loading. When loading, the quantity and loading status shall be monitored
and recorded. During voyages, we conduct cargo hold monitoring, 
recording, or ventilation according to the cargo conditions. We also record
the weather en route, sea conditions, speed and fuel consumption, etc. 
in detail. The unloading process is monitored to avoid cargo deficiencies.Policy
CManagement
Approach1. Comply with the International Maritime Solid Bulk 
Cargoes Code ( IMSBC Cod e) and the International 
Maritime Dangerous Goods Code ( IMDG Cod e). 
Conduct seafarer training and implement operating 
procedures.
2. Regular ship maintenance to ensure that the cargo 
hold is watertight and clean.
3. Maintain close communication with vessels on loading
 and unloading preparations and provide support.Commitment
1. Continue to increase the initial passing rate of hold 
inspection per voyage.
2. Continue to reduce the cargo deficiency rate per voyage.
3. Monitor delivery time.Goals and 
Targets
DCargo deficiency and hold inspection passing rate are two KPI items of 
the monitoring mechanism. In 2020, the cargo deficiency rate per voyage 
was 1.29%. Not only was it lower than the average over the years, but 
also decrease by approximately 7.2% compared to 2019. In 2020, the 
initial passing rate of cargo inspection per voyage was 96.81%, maintaining 
the high passing rate over the years while achieving an improvement 
compared to 2019 (please refer to 3.2.1 Cargo Shippin g). Since 2017, 
real-time vessel position, speed, and weather are also monitored with the 
StormGeo fleet daily report system to optimize sailing routes and time. 
From the above observations, Wisdom’s shipping quality management 
shows a long-term trend of stable improvement. Adjustment of the 
management approach is not needed for the time being.Evaluation

Aiming at high-quality ship management services, the Wisdom fleet strictly complies with the IMSBC 
Code and IMDG Code. Under the premise of safe voyage, loading and unloading are conducted according
to ship type and cargo type. We also make flexible adjustments according to the specific needs of 
charterers and the market.
In 2020, Wisdom’s total loading voyage was 1,160, of which 15 had cargo deficiencies and the cargo 
deficiency was 1.29%, representing an improvement of 7% from the previous year, which was lower 
than the average over the years. Since 2016, our deficiency rate is showing a steady improvement trend 
in the long term. As the fleet grows, Wisdom is still putting continuous effort into safe shipping and loss 
prevention. We continue to strive for high-quality shipping management and gain recognition from 
clients with our international and professional fleet.
seafarers to oversee the loading and unloading operation by local stevedores assigned by charterers 
and shippers to achieve the goal of zero cargo deficiency rate and improve service quality.
To reduce cargo deficiency, through email, telephone, the Business & Operation Dept. provides a list 
of precautionary matters related to the cargo and the loading and unloading port to each ship. The 
information includes loading precautions, cargo water level test results, cargo temperature monitoring, etc.
Also, the Loss Prevention Archive has been established in the Company’s internal eannouncement 
system to collect international information on the prevention of cargo loss. Such information is used by 
the Business & Operation Dept. for training. The department can also share the information with our 
vessels to strengthen the effectiveness of preventing cargo damage.
With the assistance of the P&I Club, Wisdom handles cargo damage according to the following 
procedures:The initial inspection passing rate for 1,160 
cargo hold inspections was approximately 
96.81%, only 37 of which failed the initial 
inspection, which is better than the previous 
year. Maintaining a high passing rate is 
attributed to Wisdom’s assiduity to the 
preparation for hold inspections, which is 
also a demonstration of high-quality shipping 
management.
For continuous improvement of shipping 
quality, Wisdom has established procedures 
for handling cargo damage and assigned a 
loss prevention team under the Business & 
Operation Dept. to collect relevant information. 
We have also assigned employees to participate 
in seminars to strengthen their knowledge 
and ability in cargo loading safety. In addition,

3.2.2 Monitoring Vessel Conditions
As from October 2017, to improve fleet management, Wisdom introduced a daily report and weather 
system developed by StormGeo, a weather routing company. It provides a user-friendly reporting 
system with debugging functions for our vessels. The system provides ship navigation efficiency 
reports to improve management quality.
Features of StormGeo daily report and weather system include:
■ Noon report system: Daily shipping data is recorded in a standard format, which is uploaded and
   stored in StormGeo’s cloud server.
■ Vessel tracking system: The Company keeps track of vessel position in real-time with the satellite
    and shore Automatic Identification System ( AIS).
■ Weather system: Provide real-time weather information according to each vessel’s location.
■ Vessel energy efficiency analysis: The system can identify the shipping routes included in the MRV
     regulations, further analyze navigation data, record greenhouse
     gas emissions, and automatically generate European Union
     Monitoring, Reporting, Verification ( MRV) reports to save manpower.
 3.3 Vessel Operation
  and Supply Chain  Management
Wisdom Group usually orders newbuildings with Japanese shipyards and assigns consultants to oversee
the process. Classification societies will examine and confirm that the vessel specifications comply 
with international conventions and issue certificates during the construction stage. Vessels must 
obtain certificates issued by flag states before sailing.
After the launching of vessels, flag states and the classification societies will renew certificates regularly
to ensure seaworthiness. During operation, we need to cooperate with suppliers, crew manning agencies,
insurance companies, and dock yards to ensure vessel safety and efficiency for shipping.
To maintain operational efficiency of the Wisdom fleet, vessels of age over 15 years are listed as assets 
to be disposed of. We seek buyers in the second-hand market or sell them to shipbreakers for scrapping.Bank:

3.3.1 Shipyard
The initial design of vessels will affect the sailing conditions of their life cycle. Therefore, Wisdom 
prioritizes the use of Eco ships designed by Japanese shipyards. They are equipped with anti-pollution 
treatment equipment, which improves operational efficiency and reduces pollution to the environment. 
Due to the long-term partnership between Wisdom and Japanese shipyards, we have competitive 
vessel prices and specifications. The shipyards are willing to fully communicate with the Company on 
new vessel designs and new regulations. The shipyards provide satisfactory service in newbuilding 
warranty, including subsequent spare part delivery, technical support and arranging technician to 
provide services on board.
As of 2020, Wisdom has collaborated with 13 newbuilding shipyards, including 12 from Japan and one 
Japanese-owned Chinese shipyard.
3.3.2 Classification Society
To ensure vessels registered in countries of IMO member states comply with international conventions, 
vessels must be inspected regularly by the classification societies authorized by a member state to 
ensure vessel safety and seaworthiness.
Sizable international classification societies jointly established the International Association of Classification
Societies (IACS) to consolidate and formulate vessel construction regulations and inspection standards. 
Classification societies in cooperation with Wisdom are all members of IACS, information of which 
is as follows:3.3.3 Repair Dock Yard
The shipping routes of Wisdom’s fleet span around the world. The dry-dockings must discuss with the 
charterer the time and location of vessel delivery and return in advance, and make appropriate
arrangements depending on whether the ship repair yard is equipped with certified technical qualification.
After selecting ship repair yards, the Technical Dept. will continue to discuss construction schedules 
and methods through telephone and e-mail. After the completion of dry-docking, the Technical Dept. 
will record and assess the construction quality, ability to control the progress, engineering technology, 
communication, and cooperation of the shipyard. If the shipyard and the engineering staff obtained 
relevant certificates and the repair quality meets the inspection standards of the classification society, 
they will be included in the prioritized list for future dry-docking partnerships.
In 2020, the Company cooperated with eight ship repair yards, including five in China, one in Turkey, 
and one in Brazil, and one in Sri Lanka.

2020 Wisdom Marine Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 3Shipping Planning and Management
To ensure supplier quality, price, credit, and capacity meets vessel’s requirement, the Company 
controls the quality, price, service, and delivery time of vessel purchases according to vessel requisition
material types. We require all suppliers to comply with the Company’s ethical management principles, 
conduct open and transparent transactions, and shall not directly or indirectly provide, promise, 
request, or accept any form of improper benefits to encourage suppliers to realize the Company’s 
corporate social responsibility philosophy. To fulfill our environmental protection philosophy, the Company
purchases vessel equipment locally as much as possible to reduce carbon emissions during transportation.
For vessel paints, chemicals, and lubricants, the Company cooperates with fixed suppliers to maintain 
stable prices and service quality. All suppliers are required to issue CSR reports to fulfill their corporate 
social responsibilities.
Evaluation of New Suppliers
The majority of the Wisdom fleets are dry bulk vessels, with shipping routes around the 
world. Most ports have established long-term partnerships with suppliers, while some of 
them are less convenient. In case of an urgent requirement to purchase vessel equipment, 
long-term partnership suppliers will be taken as priority. In ports without partner suppliers, 
qualified suppliers approved by the International Shipsuppliers & Services Association 
(ISSA ) will be selected to ensure supply quality. Suppliers registered on the ISSA website 
must comply with ISO standards ( e..g. ISO 9001 quality management system, ISO 14001 
environmental management system, ISO 45001 occupational safety and health management
syste m) and ethical standards ( e.g. prohibited sales below cost or at unreasonably low 
prices, prohibition of exaggerating false product information, prohibited forms of tade 
restraints–unlawful price fixing, defamation of competitors or false disparagement of their 
products, enticing away employees of competitor s).
In addition to the above evaluations, the Company’s “ New Vendor Evaluation For m” evaluates
external suppliers in the following order. Those qualified will be included in the supplier list.
Legality● Whether the Company is legally registere d/its reputation
 and market evaluation.
Supply 
capacity● Supply capacity of the por t/region, cargo inventory condition
 and scale of warehouse.
● Whether the products provided meet the Company’s quality
 requirement s/the degree of conformity.
● Whether they have sufficient supply experience.
Other● Supplier reputation in the industry.
● Whether the supplier or its production and service processes
 have obtained environmental certificates.Evaluation of Existing Suppliers
Suppliers are classified into five groups according to vessel requisition material types and 
the supplier contact list will be established. The Company inquiries supplier base on the 
supplier contact list and process procurement procedure. Subsequent evaluation will be 
carried out from time to time to keep track of the suppliers’ obligation performance, which 
serves as a reference for continuous cooperation. At present, we evaluate the suppliers’ 
obligation performance mainly through seafarers’ reports on their supply condition. The 
Company also distributes material evaluation forms from time to time to be filled in by 
seafarers to keep track of supply quality.
In 2020, there were 30 new suppliers approved by the Company. Wisdom will also take into 
account CSR factors when partnering with new suppliers. As of the end of 2020, 11 of the 
top 20 suppliers in cooperation with Wisdom have published CSR Reports to disclose their 
contribution to the society and environment.

4.2.1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Wisdom’s greenhouse gases are mainly emissions from fuel combustion during navigation. Operational
boundaries are established by the concept of operational control. Scopes 1, 2, and 3 represent 
self-operated voyages, electricity consumption at the headquarters, and emissions by the chartered 
Wisdom flee, respectively. 2020 greenhouse gas emissions are as following:

Note 1:  Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions are estimated by the amount of fuel combustion, only carbon 
 dioxide is included. Scope 2 is calculated based on the electricity emission coefficient. Greenhouse
 gases include: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.
Note 2:  The emission coefficient of high sulphur fuel oil ( HSFO), low sulphur fuel oil ( LSFO), and other
 oils are 3.114, 3.151, and 3.206, respectively.
Note 3:  The electricity emission coefficient was 0.533kg CO 2/degree in 2018 and 0.509kg CO 2/degree
 in 2019.
■EEOI
The calculation method of EEOI proposed by IMO is as follows:
EEOI = (tons of carbon dioxide emission by fuel combustio n)/
 (tons of cargo x nautical mile s)
Unit: tons of carbon dioxid e/tons-nautical miles

10%19.512019The lower the EEOI, the better the operating performance. A fully loaded ship sailing at an economical 
speed is the best possible scenario. However, the speed still needs to be adjusted according to client 
needs. Wisdom reviews the EEOI of the fleet every half year. The EEOI of the fleet was 17.52 in 2020, 
showing an improvement of 10% compared with 19.51 in 2019.4.2.2 Emission of Air Pollutants
Wisdom fleet has obtained Engine International Air Pollution Prevention ( EIAP P) and Technical File 
to manage nitrogen oxide. We also manage sulphur oxides and ozone-depleting substances in 
accordance with the SMS.
■Nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide emissions
In 2020, the Wisdom fleet ( including self-operated and chartered voyage s) recorded 63 metric tons of 
sulphur oxide emission, a significant decrease compared to 2019, which is due to the implementation 
of the IMO sulphur restriction in 2020. The Wisdom fleet has fully adopted very low sulphur fuel oil 
except for three vessels that have been installed with scrubber. Nitrogen oxide emission was 52,501 
metric tons. The emissions are estimated using the formula of BIMCO SHIPPING KPI and data calculated 
by the vessel noon report system.
■Ozone depleting substances
In response to regulatory requirements and to reduce the damage caused by shipping to the ozone 
layer, Wisdom’s newbuilding vessels have been using environmentally friendly refrigerants in recent 
years. During the transition period of regulations, 12 ships still use non- environmental refrigerants. 
In 2020, the total amount of non-environmentally friendly refrigerants replenished was 0.29 tons.Note:  The calculation of sulphur oxide emissions is based on the oil sulphur content ( %) X coefficient 
 20 (kg/ton) X oil consumption ( ton)

■Energy Efficiency Design Index
The Energy Efficiency Design Index ( EEDI) refers to the carbon emissions per tonne mile of cargo 
carried by vessels. The index is closely related to engines, machinery energy efficiency and technologies,
and hull equipment. In addition, larger vessels generally have higher energy efficiency because of their 
large cargo capacity. The EEDI value is calculated according to the differences in vessel types and 
equipment. Each vessel is required to meet specific standards. The calculated standards are set out in 
the International Energy Efficiency Certificate ( IEEC).
Wisdom Marine has laid keels since 2013, while EEDI calculation and examination for newbuildings 
have begun since 2015. In recent years, the average EEDI of Wisdom Marine’s Panamax and Supramax 
fleets is approximately 10% to 20% better than the calculation standards. Handy has a lower cargo 
capacity because of its smaller size. Therefore, even with similar engines and equipment, its energy 
efficiency is lower than large vessels.By engine type, as of 2020, the Wisdom fleet has 59 new Eco ships equipped with ME engines, 
accounting for 43% of the fleet. Wisdom’s new vessels are built with the latest energy-saving designs 
and old vessels are replaced as appropriate. Vessels with ME engines are expected to reach 65 by 
2021, accounting for 45% of the fleet.

 4Sustainable Marine Environment4.4.1 Ballast water management
When ships are not loaded or the cargo amount is low, ballast water is discharged into the ballast tanks 
to adjust the trim and stabilize the vessel, evenly distribute the hull loading, and make sure the propeller
blade is sufficient to maintain propulsion efficiency. This is to ensure the stability and safety of the 
voyage. Ballast water is discharged when the cargo arrives at the loading port.
According to the estimation of IMO, the total amount of ballast water discharged by ships worldwide is 
approximately 3 to 5 billion tons per year. When ballast water from one water is discharged to another, 
marine organisms and pathogens in the original water are carried over, which may affect the ecology.
Illustration of the ballast water system
1 2 3 4
1 Unloadin g-Local water is drawn at the departure port as ballast water
 Local water is drawn during unloading, which is discharged into the water tank as ballast 
water. During the process, plankton and other tiny organisms are drawn into the tank.
2 Empty cargo hol d-Fill the water tank while sailing to stabilize the ship
 Ship water tanks without cargo will be fully filled to improve the sailing stability during navigation.
3 Loading -Ballast water from the departure port is discharged at the destination port
 Upon arrival at the port of destination, where cargo is loaded, ballast water and marine 
organisms from the place of departure are discharged to the port of destination, resulting 
in long-distance migration, which may destroy the local ecology.
4 Fully-loaded carg o-The water tank is empty while sailing
 The weight of a fully-loaded cargo hold is enough to increase its draft, during which the 
ballast tank does not need to be loaded with ballast water.The potential hazards brought by ballast water cannot be underestimated. Therefore, IMO proposed 
the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments 
(BWM) in 2004. After the Convention entered into force, vessels must install a Ballast Water Treatment 
System following the schedule specified in the Convention to remove microorganisms in ballast water 
and prevent microorganisms from migrating along with vessels. Vessels without a Ballast Water Treatment
System are required to exchange ballast water over 200 nautical miles from the shore and at a depth 
of over 200 meters. This is due to the fact that oceanic seawater has fewer sediments and pathogenic 
microorganisms compared with coastal seawater, which can reduce the damage caused by the migration
of microorganisms.
At present, the Ballast Water Treatment System can be divided into three types ( 1) Ultraviolet ( UV), 
(2) Electrolysis, and ( 3) Chemical.
As of 2020, Wisdom has a total of 118 vessels equipped with ballast water management systems, 
accounting for 86% of the fleet. In the future, Wisdom will successively install Ballast Water Treatment 
System for the Wisdom fleet based on the docking schedules. The selection of Ballast Water Treatment 
System will depend on the technical performance, cost, power consumption, and space. Currently, the 
aforementioned 3 types have all been adopted
The installation plan of ballast water equipment is shown in the table below. It will be arranged according
to the docking schedule. 91% vessels of the Wisdom fleet are expected to be installed with Ballast 
Water Treatment System by the end of 2021.

 4Sustainable Marine Environment4.4.2 Wastewater and Garbage Management
Shipping garbage and wastewater management mainly comply with the MARPOL ANNEX V-Prevention 
of Pollution by Garbage from Ships. The regulation seeks to reduce the amount of garbage and cargo 
residues being discharged into the sea from ships. It also prohibits the discharge of wash water and 
deck water containing substances that may damage the marine environment. The regulations are as 
follows:
IMO has implemented garbage disposal regulations for sailing in polar regions (latitude 66.5° or abov e) 
since January 1, 2017. Wisdom has incorporated new measures into the garbage management plan in 
accordance with the regulations. However, our current business does not pass through polar regions.Type Measures

■Garbage disposal
The Wisdom fleet categorizes garbage into food waste, garbage to be recycled, plastic products, oily 
rags or other oily materials, and incineration ashes. Garbage bins are designed with different colors 
and standard logos to distinguish the type of garbage. Wisdom has also set up an area on the rear deck 
to collect garbage. Garbage is properly classified and disposed of in each cabin.
According to the regulations, garbage that must be disposed of onshore includes plastic garbage and 
other garbage that is not allowed to be discharged into the sea. Therefore, garbage generated by the 
Wisdom fleet during the voyage is generally disposed of by a contractor. The total amount of garbage 
collected onshore is shown in the table below. In 2020, the total amount of garbage disposed of 
onshore was higher than the previous year, mainly due to the increase in loaded cargoes that are more 
likely to generate additional cargo residues in 2020, such as barks of timber.

 4Sustainable Marine Environment 4.5 Environmental Regulation Compliance
Wisdom is committed to protecting the marine environment. The operation of the Wisdom fleet complies
with international conventions and regulations.
In 2019, a ship from M.V. Bizen was draining the ballast tank before unloading at Ube port in Japan, as 
the discharge valve of the bilge well was accidentally loosened, oily wastewater was discharged by the 
ballast pump from the bilge well into the sea.
When the crew member on duty discovered the abnormal oil pollution on the sea, he immediately 
notified the cabin to stop the operation and reported to the authority at the port. On February 25, 2020, 
the Japanese authority at the port completed the investigation of the incident and imposed a fine of 
JPY700,000 on the vessel. The incident was caused by an accidental spill due to equipment failure.
Other than the above incident, the Wisdom fleet did not violate other international environmental 
regulations in 2019 and 2020. The Company will continue to monitor the fleet to ensure strict 
compliance with international environmental regulations.

  the crew manning agency, which are submitted to each
  department to arrange interviews on their experience
  and operational capabilities. The Business & Operation
  Dept. will interview the Captain and Chief Officer while
  the Technical Dept. will interview the Chief Engineer.
  Only those who pass the interview will be hired.
● Class B seafarers: The Seaman Affairs Dept. screens resumes of all seafarer
  ranks required for ships of different sizes and selects
  seafarers who have licenses and meet the Company’s
  needs. Meetings will be arranged for successful
  candidates.

discrimination at the workplace, Wisdom adopts equal 
and fair treatment in talent selection and employee
