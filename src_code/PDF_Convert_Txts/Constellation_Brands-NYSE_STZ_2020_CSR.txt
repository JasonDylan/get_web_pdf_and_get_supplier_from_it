POSITIVE IMPACTS AND MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES
For more than 75 years, Constellation Brands has been committed to safeguarding our environment and 
precious natural resources, advocating for responsible consumption of beverage alcohol products, and 
making a positive difference in the lives of those most vulnerable in our communities. This commitment was 
instilled by our founder Marvin Sands, who stressed the importance of being active, engaged members of 
the communities where we live and work.
3 4RALLYING TO SUPPORT COVID-19 RELIEF EFFORTS
In addition to our ongoing efforts, our team has worked tirelessly to help pave the path to recovery for 
industry partners such as local restaurants and bars and at-risk communities disproportionately impacted by 
COVID-19, including Hispanic communities across the U.S. that have been hard hit by this pandemic. In total, 
Constellation and our brands have contributed nearly $4 million in COVID-19 related support. Marvin’s spirit lives on today through our focus on four key areas:
Serving as a model for responsible water 
stewardship  
Being a champion for the professional 
development and advancement of women
Serving as a catalyst for economic 
development and prosperity for 
disadvantaged communities
Being a culture carrier of responsible 
consumption within our industry 1

7SERVING AS A MODEL FOR RESPONSIBLE WATER 
STEWARDSHIP
Water is an essential resource for our industry and our communities and it’s important that we 
all work together in contributing to conservation efforts. For this reason, water stewardship sits at 
the forefront of our sustainability initiatives. At Constellation, being good water stewards means 
maximizing water efficiency at our facilities, maintaining source availability and quality, furthering 
conservation efforts along with our business and community partners, and reporting transparently. 
BUSINESS ALLIANCE FOR WATER AND CLIMATE (BAFWAC)
We are a signatory of the Business Alliance for Water and Climate (BAFWAC), a group 
of private-sector companies collaborating to solve water-related issues and reduce water-
related risks. Water initiatives underway in our facilities align with the goals of the alliance. 
UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 6
We also support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 to “ensure access to 
water and sanitation for all” by focusing on longer-term targets, including reducing pollution to 
improve water quality, increasing efficient use of water and ensuring sustainable withdrawals 
and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity. 
To achieve these goals, we are making strategic investments in water-saving technologies, 
water conservation measures and wastewater treatment mechanisms, and working with 
local water management authorities and other stakeholders to enhance water efficiency 
and local water infrastructure projects.
Our operations teams continue to make strides. Our breweries in Nava, Coahuila (Mexico) 
and Obregon, Sonora (Mexico) have reduced their ratio of water used per hectoliter of 
beer produced. Our Obregon brewery water intensity rate of 3.34 liters of water used per 
liter of finished product represents a reduction of 1 8% in water intensity from fiscal 2017 to 
fiscal 2019, and our Nava brewery has one of the best water intensity rates in the industry 
at 2.95 liters of water used per liter of finished product. Both breweries take advantage of 
onsite wastewater treatment operations to reuse water consumed as part of the production 
process, with Obregon reusing 20% and Nava reusing 37%.  
9 10PACIFICO PRESERVES
Pacifico partners with The Conservation Alliance to support more than 50 organizations working to 
protect North America’s wild landscapes and waterways. Through the Pacifico Preserves program, the 
brand will donate up to $100,000 in calendar 2020. The Conservation Alliance has helped to protect: 
73 million acres, 3,575 river miles and has designated 5 marine reserves. For more information, visit 
www.pacificopreserves.com. 
 
PROTECT OUR BEACHES
Corona is committed to helping keep beaches clean and generating nationwide awareness and 
excitement around ocean conservation. We’ve partnered with Oceanic Global, a not-for-profit leader 
in ocean conservation, to begin a program called “Protect Our Beaches.” We designed the program 
around three areas of emphasis: funding education through not-for-profit partners, driving greater 
awareness for plastic pollution and cleaning up beaches and waterways.
RUFFINO CARES
In Italy, our Ruffino Group—the recipient of our 2019 Internal Environmental Sustainability Award for 
its comprehensive sustainability efforts—has enacted programs to conserve and protect water. Ruffino’s 
Gretole Estate has constructed two wetlands that are helping improve wastewater treatment by filtering 
water through marsh plants, sand and gravel. These types of wetland systems are simple to construct 
and provide effective and reliable wastewater treatment, while also providing habitat for wildlife. The 
treated wastewater can be reused for irrigation and other purposes.

DRIVING SUSTAINABILITY  
ACROSS OUR BUSINESS
In addition to our focus on water stewardship, we are also committed 
to other sustainability practices, including efforts concentrating 
on waste minimization, pollution prevention, recycling, resource 
conservation and energy efficiency. Waste is a part of any production 
process, and we pride ourselves on creatively innovating ways 
to reduce environmental impacts from our waste generation, 
transportation, and disposition at all our sites and in each country and 
community where we operate. We are decreasing our dependence 
on non‐renewable energy sources whenever possible, and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. We continuously 
monitor our carbon footprint and have worked to effectively reduce 
emissions per liter of product produced. For more about our progress 
on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions, go to the Addendum. Across the nine vineyards spanning 2,000 acres that make up our 
Central Valley Vineyards in California, enhanced vineyard crop 
management using automated precision irrigation and in-line 
fertilization has reduced overall water usage by as much as 1 5%. At 
our Simi Winery in Sonoma County, Calif., we improved design and 
processes to sustain a quality water supply now, and into the future.  
This includes an improved tank sanitization process that significantly 
reduces water use and wastewater generation, the use of open-
top fermenters to collect rainwater during non-harvest months, and 
increased use of recycled water in wash cycles. These efforts have led  
to the vineyard using 300,000 fewer gallons of water per year.

13CHAMPIONING 
THE PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND  
ADVANCEMENT OF 
WOMEN 
Women make up over half of the U.S. population 
and account for more than $39 trillion in spending 
in this country alone. Yet women remain an 
underrepresented demographic in the beverage 
alcohol industry and other segments of the business 
community. We are committed to doing our part to 
change this by providing resources to support the 
advancement of women at Constellation Brands, 
within our industry, and within our communities.
Over the past five years, we’ve consistently 
increased representation of women in our executive 
leadership ranks. Women now occupy over 35% of 
our executive leadership roles in the U.S., and we 
have similarly increased women on our Executive 
Management Committee and Board of Directors.
To affect broader change, we are leveraging our 
size and scale to invest in female entrepreneurs 
within beverage alcohol and adjacent categories. 
We remain committed to investing $100 million 
through 2028 in female-founded or female-
led companies through our Focus on Female 
Founders program. Since launching the program, 
our Ventures portfolio has gone from being 20% 
female-owned to almost 50% female-founded/
owned. Most recently, we acquired a minority 
stake in PRESS Premium Alcohol Seltzer, a maker 
of premium-quality hard seltzer with only natural 
ingredients. This growth validates the untapped 
opportunity with female consumers and helps  
to increase the prominence of female leadership 
within our industry.
In support of women in our communities, we established a national partnership with Dress For 
Success Worldwide, an organization that empowers women to achieve economic independence 
through a network of support, development tools and professional attire to help women thrive 
in work and in life. Our partnership provides funding at the national level to support program 
development and local assistance to affiliate chapters in San Francisco, Chicago, Rochester, 
N.Y., and Mexico City, where we have major office locations, directly funding the professional 
development of 1,200 disadvantaged women in our surrounding communities. In addition, 
Win. Inspire. Support. Elevate. (WISE), our Business Resource Group focused on networking 
and development opportunities for women of all levels at Constellation, spearheads employee 
engagement opportunities to further support these local affiliates. 
16
15SERVING AS A CATALYST FOR  
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPERITY 
FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES
Constellation Brands is also committed  
to addressing the needs of disadvantaged 
communities in areas where we live 
and work, with an initial focus on 
Hispanic/Latinx communities. The 
Hispanic population is the fastest 
growing demographic in the U.S. and 
our authentic Mexican beer brands have 
been an integral part of special moments 
with family and friends for members 
of this community for many years. As 
an extension of this shared cultural 
appreciation and inherent connection, we 
are focused on working with community-
based organizations in Hispanic 
communities across the U.S. to provide 
resources and support that enhance 
overall quality of life for local residents. 
Through our Summer Service program 
in Chicago in 2019, we partnered with 
Latinos Progresando (an organization 
devoted to providing resources to 
members of the Hispanic community to 
build secure, healthy and productive lives) 
for a volunteer event with more than 250 
of our Constellation team members and distributors. The group performed projects 
to support social service agencies, 
healthcare providers and schools that 
are part of the Marshall Square Resource 
Network, a collection of 40 institutional 
partners working together to improve the 
lives of local residents in Little Village, the 
heart of Chicago’s Hispanic community.    
We are also supporting disadvantaged 
communities through our Modelo Fighting 
Chance Project. This three-year $1 
million commitment, launched in 201 8 in 
partnership with the International Rescue 
Committee, aims to make a positive 
impact in the lives of refugees, immigrants, 
and Americans in need, providing them 
with the financial tools and support 
necessary to achieve their vision of the 
American dream.
BEING A CULTURE CARRIER OF 
RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION 
WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY
We strive to ensure our products are marketed to legal, drinking-age 
adults in a responsible and appropriate manner, and we insist that 
our employees, brands, partners, agencies and affiliated companies 
involved in the promotion of our brands are ambassadors of 
responsible consumption. 
17 18GLOBAL CODE OF 
RESPONSIBLE PRACTICES
We have developed our Global Code of Responsible 
Practices for Beverage Alcohol Advertising and Marketing 
to provide the fundamental framework for responsible brand 
advertising and marketing. The comprehensive code—
including guidance on media placements and events used 
for marketing, product placements and more—ensures our 
messages are directed at legal, drinking-age consumers. 
The code must be adhered to as part of the approval 
process for all advertising and marketing materials.
In collaboration with internal teams, including Public 
Affairs and Government Relations, and through our active 
membership in industry groups including the Beer Institute, 
The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States and the 
Wine Institute, we advocate for responsible consumption 
of alcohol and work in partnership with government 
counterparts to advance responsible alcohol policy. 
FEDERAL TRADE 
COMMISSION
More broadly, we have amplified the Federal Trade 
Commission’s “We Don’t Serve Teens” campaign for 
more than a decade, further promoting responsible 
consumption among more than 207 million people 
in markets across the U.S. 
FISAC FOUNDATION
In Mexico, our team works with the Fundación de 
Investigaciones Sociales, A.C. (FISAC Foundation) 
in its prevention program designed to educate 
young people about the harmful effects of underage  
alcohol use.WASHINGTON REGIONAL 
ALCOHOL PROGRAM
We partner with the Washington Regional Alcohol 
Program (WRAP), which provides alcohol policy 
advocacy in D.C., Maryland and Virginia and runs 
the long-standing SoberRide program. Constellation 
Brands sponsors the free regional ride program that 
provides more than 3,800 rides during key holidays 
throughout the year. We are committed to responsible consumption, and to further enhance our efforts, we have 
established partnerships, including:
Additionally, we are committed to reducing drinking and driving and modeling responsible behavior. 
To reinforce this responsible mindset, we provide employees ride share codes to use in utilizing safe 
transportation options following company-sponsored events and incentive trips where alcohol is consumed.
BRAND SOCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY CAMPAIGNS
Our brands also promote responsible consumption through 
local programs. During the 2019 holiday season in Chicago, 
members of our sales team distributed more than 3,000 full-
fare Chicago Transit Authority cards to consumers in taverns, 
bars and restaurants as a reminder to get home safely and 
responsibly by using public transportation. On New Year’s 
Eve, Corona offered Chicagoans up to $5 off rides through 
rideshare app Freebird to help get them home safely.

20EMPOWERING OUR EMPLOYEES 
TO GIVE BACK 
Giving back to the communities in which we live and work is 
something we’ve been doing for 75 years, since our founder, 
Marvin Sands, first brought this commitment to life. We support 
this effort in a variety of ways, including our Employee Match 
Program in which the company matches employees’ charitable 
contributions to qualified 501(c)(3) organizations 1:1 up to 
a maximum of $2500 per year. Our employees across the 
globe continue to embrace this program, generously donating 
their time and funds to local causes they are passionate about.

ADDENDUMDRIVING SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS THE BUSINESS
While water stewardship is a core focus, we are committed to additional sustainability efforts, 
including: promoting waste minimization, pollution prevention, recycling, resource conservation, 
energy efficiency, and continuous improvement of our environmental management system. 
We are decreasing our dependence on non‐renewable energy sources whenever possible, 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. We continuously monitor our 
carbon footprint and have worked to effectively reduce emissions per liter of product produced. 
In our Obregon brewery in Mexico, between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019, the brewery reduced 
its total energy ratio of beer produced by 8.7 1 megajoules used per hectoliter, while going 
through an expansion project and increasing production capacity. In addition, from fiscal 
2017 through the end of fiscal 2019, Obregon reduced its use of fuel oil for thermal energy 
production by more than 1.3 million liters, an equivalent to a reduction of 3,202 tons of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (CO2eq). 
We also take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our supply chain. At our Nava 
brewery, by transporting some of our finished product by rail instead of trucks, we significantly 
lowered emissions. Every ton-mile of freight that moves by rail instead of truck reduces 
greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds or more.
Across Italy, our Ruffino estates are shifting to organic production. Ruffino started this organic 
conversion years ago by adopting an internal sustainability protocol aimed at the reduction 
of the use of herbicides, followed by their gradual elimination and replacement with different 
methods. Switching to organic viticulture means not only sustainability but also environmental 
biodiversity and the creation of a balanced environment.
Waste is a part of any production process, and we pride ourselves on creatively innovating ways 
to reduce environmental impacts from our waste generation, transportation, and disposition at all 
our sites and in all of the countries and communities where we operate. Our Nava and Obregon 
breweries in Mexico each diverted 99% of their waste produced in fiscal 2019. 
Our Ruffino Group applies the principle of Continuous Improvement to their waste management 
by reviewing their contracts with waste management companies annually. This exercise helps 
uncover further recycling opportunities and identify new ways to engage with dry goods 
suppliers (glass, corks, labels and cardboard) on waste reduction initiatives.

66,266237,576In fiscal 201 8, Constellation’s GHG emissions (scope 1 & 2) totaled 370,439 metric tons of CO2e, which is a 22% increase from 
fiscal 2017. The increase in emissions is due to the acquisition of the Obregon Brewery and High West distillery (both at the end of 
2016). These two facilities were excluded from fiscal 2017’s reporting scope due to limited data and reporting feasibility, but are 
included in fiscal 201 8 reporting.  
About 85% of our emissions were direct emissions from the combustion of natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel. The remaining 
1 5% of the GHG emissions total were indirect emissions from purchased electricity.  
We continually strive to expand our GHG tracking of Scope 3 emissions. We currently track Scope 3 emissions from business 
travel, downstream transportation and distribution, and waste generated in operations.
1. Direct and indirect energy sources refer to those that generate Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions as defined by the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Reporting Protocol.
2. In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and to make annual data comparable, we adjust the energy data each year as a result of the opening and closing of facilities and  
 use of more appropriate emission factors that are available.
3. The data presented is based on actual measurements to the extent possible. Where direct measurements are not available, we employ engineering calculations or estimates. We  
 continue to strive to increase the accuracy of the data we report.
4. The data presented is associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our breweries, wineries, vineyards, distilleries, warehouses, and offices.
5. Our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions) have been verified by a third-party verification/assurance company in accordance with the  
 International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 and ISO Standard 1 4064-3 Greenhouse gases - Part 3: Specification with Guidance for the Validation and  
 Verification of Greenhouse Gas Assertions. The verification was using a limited assurance level as described in the standards.

23,734In fiscal 2019, total withdrawals decreased by 20% from fiscal 201 8. Many sustainability initiatives at our production facilities—
such as water reuse and water saving projects—contributed to the water withdrawal decrease. In addition, in fiscal 201 8, several 
of our locations were exposed to drought conditions, which led to an increase in overall water withdrawal for vineyard irrigation. 
However, in fiscal 2019, the increased rainfall in Italy, California, and New Zealand decreased the need for water withdrawal to 
irrigate vineyards and therefore contributed to the decrease of total withdrawal volume.
