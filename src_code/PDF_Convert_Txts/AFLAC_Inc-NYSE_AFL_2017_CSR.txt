2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 3 
“If you take care of the employees, they will 
take care of the business.”
Growing up the son of one of the creators of 
what is now a Fortune 135 company, I heard 
axioms like this all the time. It was the dream 
of the three brothers who created what is 
now Aflac to nurture a business that would 
become a force for good in the world through 
its products and principles. Our founders 
were ahead of their time in realizing that 
being a good corporate citizen should be 
more than a checkmark on a form; it should 
be a prime component of a successful 
business plan. Today, we call it corporate 
social responsibility. Back in their day, it was 
simply called doing the right thing.As I introduce our 2017 Corporate Social 
Responsibility Report, which recaps the 
events and initiatives that make Aflac a great 
corporate citizen, I am proud to say that being 
a positive influence on society has been 
Aflac’s promise for more than 60 years. My 
hope is that you will find that our promise 
has not dimmed over time; in fact, it has only 
shone brighter.
This report celebrates decades of business 
success as well as more than $123 million 
contributed to the treatment and research 
of childhood cancer. It highlights awards for 
environmental conservation and a diverse 
workforce of more than 5,000 employees 
and 70,000 independent sales agents 
licensed to sell our products. It informs on our 
corporate initiatives in both the United States 
and Japan, where Aflac products protect 1 in 
every 4 households.
We share the story behind My Special Aflac 
Duck ™, an innovative robotic companion 
that uses joyful play to help children engage 
and connect as they go through treatment. 
Our mission is to give one to each newly 
diagnosed child ages 3-13 in the United 
States – free of charge.
In this report, you will read about our new 
gamification program to help children learn 
the value of leadership so that future 
generations will continue to value companies 
that care. You will see how at Aflac we encourage 
diversity, authenticity and professional 
development at every level and how in 
Japan, we are making significant headway 
toward achieving Prime Minister Abe’s goal of 
enhancing female career advancement 
at workplaces.
Society evolves with time, but what hasn’t 
changed – and never will – is Aflac’s 
core values that embody our promise to 
helping customers in need while serving 
the community. We are committed to doing 
business the right way, which, in large part, is 
why we continue to lead our industry today. 
Thank you, and enjoy the Aflac 2017 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report.

102-86 | 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility ReportAflac worked with Reputation Institute, 
considered the gold standard in reputation 
tracking, to conduct research on the 
company’s overall reputation as compared to 
competitors and RepTrak 100 companies. This 
research enabled the team to link reputation 
with business drivers and to identify seven 
key dimensions of reputation: performance, 
products and services, innovation, workplace, 
governance, citizenship and leadership.
The four CSR elements most relevant to Aflac 
consumers and investors based on our analysis 
of Reputation Institute’s research and analytics 
are governance, workplace, philanthropy and 
sustainability. These pillars became the outline 
of Aflac’s 2017 CSR Report and campaign.Aflac is committed to investing in a sustainable 
future to ultimately improve generations to 
come. Action taken today will show its impact 
tomorrow — the 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development carry this 
same sentiment.
Countries around the globe have adopted 
this set of goals to end poverty, protect the 
planet and ensure prosperity as part of a new 
sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the 
next 15 years.
Aflac’s business focuses on five of the 17 SDGs: 
quality education, gender equality, affordable 
and clean energy, responsible consumption 
and production, and climate action. Within 
the five chapters of Aflac’s 2017 CSR Report, 
our actions and initiatives implemented 
throughout the year align with this set of goals, 
contributing to a better tomorrow.

GOVERNANCE MORE THAN A PROMISE
It is a badge of honor that the words Aflac 
and ethical are so often used in the same 
sentence. Publications, industry peers, 
clients and shareholders have taken note and 
commended our efforts in this aspect of our 
business. Indeed, we recognize that ethics is 
the cornerstone of any good business, and 
maintaining ethical practices is a top priority. Since the company’s founding, Aflac aimed 
to consider not only profits, but doing 
business the right way.  The way in which this 
company has thrived is proof-positive that 
values can be used as a roadmap to success. 
We’ve codified this roadmap in our Code of 
Conduct and “The Aflac Way,” both of which 
will be discussed in the following chapter.
As you read this chapter, please take 
note of the positive impact that an ethical 
environment can have at all echelons of our 
business structure. I think you’ll see that this 
company’s future success hinges on our ability 
to do the right thing by never compromising 
our values. 
Our team’s ethical treatment of our clients and 
safeguarding Aflac’s hard-earned reputation 
has propelled our company as an industry 
leader in doing what is right.

GOVERNANCE: GOVERNANCE MORE THAN A PROMISE
A PROMISE TO BE ETHICAL
Aflac was founded in 1955 by principal founder 
John Amos and his brothers, Paul and Bill Amos, 
to provide individuals and families with added 
protection.  In other words, they promised to 
help with costs that major medical may not 
cover and to help pay bills that continue to roll in 
when a breadwinner is sick or injured. The Amos 
brothers laid down a virtuous foundation when 
they started offering this promise door to door, 
which built and solidified Aflac’s reputation as a business governed by ethics, integrity and 
service to others. 
Now, more than 60 years later, Aflac is the No. 
1 provider of individual voluntary insurance 
products at the worksite in the U.S. according to 
the Eastbridge Consulting Group, Inc.’s 2017 U.S. 
Worksite/Voluntary Sales Report. Aflac is also 
listed at No. 135 in the Fortune 500 with annual 
revenues of $22 billion. And it’s regarded as 
one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by 
Ethisphere Institute. Aflac principal founder John Amos (C) with brothers Paul Amos (L) and Bill Amos (R)
Ken Dowless is passionate about protecting 
the brand and supporting Aflac’s promise to 
policyholders. He runs Aflac Trust, an anti-fraud 
team that monitors, investigates and stops 
fraudulent claim submissions from inside and 
outside the company. This is important because 
preventing fraud and abuse helps us keep our 
promise to customers to serve them better 
while keeping their costs down. His team stays 
one step ahead of threats by using proprietary 
algorithms designed to seek out suspicious 
activity and flag unethical behavior. Machine 
learning and analytics tools map curious cases 
to past examples of fraud, creating a system-
wide memory that knows what to look for. In 
addition, Ken shares his wealth of knowledge 
to teach good behavior to employees across 
our company. As part of his mission, Ken and 
his team provide annual ethics training to 
employees and independent sales agents.

GOVERNANCE MORE THAN A PROMISE
THE AFLAC WAY
Aflac’s commitment to behaving in an ethical, 
trustworthy manner is best captured by 
our guiding principles, also known as “The 
Aflac Way.”  In addition to making boardroom 
decisions based on what we believe is morally 
right, we expect our employees to follow suit 
at every level. Those expectations are outlined 
in the Code of Conduct .
The seven commitments in this little book 
carry a big message: We promise to do the 
right thing.TRANSPARENCY IN THE BOARDROOM 
AND BEYOND
Aflac’s commitment to transparency and 
ethical decision-making in the boardroom 
are guided by seven principle committees 
– Audit, Executive, Compensation, Pension, 
Acquisition, Corporate Social Responsibility 
and Sustainability, and Corporate Governance . 
Through these committees, Aflac shares 
information with employees, investors, 
suppliers, agents, brokers and the businesses 
that offer Aflac policies to their employees 
to ensure they’re updated on initiatives and 
the strength of the company. We also listen 
to our stakeholders. In fact, as a result of 
a shareholder’s request, we’ve conducted 
shareholder votes for compensating top-level 
executives at each annual meeting since 
2008. This initiative is commonly referred to 
as Say on Pay , and Aflac was the first publicly 
traded company in the United States to 
conduct such a nonbinding vote. 
In 2017, shareholders approved compensation 
for Aflac’s top executives by 81 percent. 
Aflac maintains an active role in the public 
policy arena, and we do so with complete 
transparency, the cornerstone of our 
communication with stakeholders.
In addition to complying with all state and 
federal regulations, we take additional steps 
to eliminate obfuscation common to corporate 
governance. For example, the company has gone beyond SEC requirements since 2012 by 
posting political contributions on Aflac.com . 
Our commitment to transparency engenders 
trust and confidence, which is critical to our 
company’s reputation.
A PROMISE TO LISTEN
Aflac conducts dozens of surveys each year 
to ensure our products, services and even our 
behavior as a company exceed expectations. 
Two of the most comprehensive and valuable 
surveys are our Aflac WorkForces Report and 
Corporate Social Responsibility Survey . 
The Aflac WorkForces Report  is an annual 
temperature check that gauges employer and 
employee attitudes and opinions about health 
insurance, health care spending and related 
issues. We use this report to help determine 
the value and viability of Aflac’s products and 
make adjustments to our lineup. It is also used 
to help associates and brokers direct their 
conversations with employers – and, in turn, 
their direct conversations with workers – with 
respect to their insurance needs and coverage. 
In short, the Aflac WorkForces Report helps us 
understand what Americans have, want, need 
and can afford when it comes to their health 
care and insurance. 
Of note, 91 percent of employers said the 
reputation of the insurance provider they 
select for their voluntary insurance products is 
extremely or very important.
In 2017, Aflac also issued its third annual They may sound simple: communicate 
regularly; respond immediately; know your 
stuff; treat everyone with respect and care; 
your problem is my problem; shoot straight; 
and cover the customer, not your behind – but 
these courtesies are rarely found in today’s 
hard-driving business world. They are the 
ultimate embodiment of doing business “The 
Aflac Way.”
Aflac’s CSR Committee meets to discuss plans for the 
upcoming year.

MORE THAN A PROMISE
Corporate Social Responsibility Survey. Insights 
from this report provide a yardstick for which 
Aflac can measure its own CSR efforts and 
help companies, including Aflac, understand 
consumer expectations for corporate behavior. 
From this report, we learned: 
• 74% of consumers agree  that responsible 
companies report what they pay their 
employees broken down by gender and 
race, even though they are not legally 
obligated to do so.  And 81% of consumers 
and 72% of investment professionals say a 
company cannot pay men more than women 
for the same work and still be responsible.  
• Millennials are more likely than boomers 
to comply when asked to do something 
unethical at work. According to the survey, 
19% of consumers report having done 
something unethical at work.  A quarter 
of consumers report having been asked to 
do something unethical by their employer, 
and, of these, 36% complied.  Compliance 
with these requests was highest among 
millennials, 47%, nearly 10 percentage points 
more than the average consumer.
CYBERSECURITY AND OUR COMPANY
Over the past few years, we’ve seen major 
corporate brands and their customers suffer at 
the hands of cybercriminals. These companies 
and others have a great deal at stake if they 
lose the trust of their customers. Maintaining 
consumer confidence is essential for the 
success of any business and especially for Aflac. 
The nature of our company requires access to sensitive health and personal details that must 
be protected. 
Overall, Aflac has a goal to exceed industry 
peers in protecting, detecting, and responding 
to data threats, and we strive for continuous 
improvement. We require all of our employees 
to complete online privacy and security 
training. As a result, employees understand 
the importance of security awareness and 
their role in protecting policyholders and the 
Aflac brand. 
A dedicated information security team detects 
and blocks millions of attacks per month, 
protecting policyholders and employees. In 
2017, more than 1 million system patches were 
applied to known information vulnerabilities. 
As a result of its criminal detection activities, 
Aflac won IDG’s 2017 CSO50 Awards for 
excellence in security intelligence and 
Security Magazine placed Aflac at No. 17 in 
the Finance/Banking/Insurance sector in their 
2017 Security 500 Rankings.
Finally, Aflac orchestrates cybersecurity 
drills with teams from both Aflac U.S. and 
Aflac Japan to ensure data is protected 
globally. The privacy of our customers is 
essential to building trust; we don’t take that 
responsibility lightly.
FRAUD PREVENTION
Together, the Aflac Trust and the Special 
Investigations Unit (SIU) deter, prevent, detect 
and respond to insurance fraud and abuse. 
Housed in the Compliance division, the teams 
lead a corporatewide anti-fraud program.GOVERNANCE

developed a fraud simulation drill featuring “Joe 
Fraudster,” an Aflac Trust employee who tested others 
by conducting mock fraudulent activities.

It starts with education. 
Throughout the year, the Aflac Trust team 
travels the country to meet with market 
directors and trainers, coordinators and 
associates to discuss training, best practices 
and performance. Prior to a trip, they audit 
a market operation in four areas of activity: 
producer, business, contests and claims.
Meanwhile, other Aflac Trust employees 
monitor for fraud across the company, 
including the field, employees, accounts and 
policyholders. They flag suspicious activity 
and refer cases to the SIU. SIU team members 
investigate potential insurance fraud and field 
force ethics violations. 
If the team finds evidence of fraud in the field, 
they present the case to executives at the 
Field Oversight and Enforcement Committee. 
If it involves an Aflac employee, it’s handled by 
Human Resources.
 
SIU reports all fraud to appropriate law 
enforcement and regulatory authorities to 
investigate and prosecute insurance fraud. 
SIU also pursues restitution for financial loss 
caused by fraud.
The Aflac Trust takes a proactive stance 
against fraud to help manage risk and 
decrease losses. In essence, our fraud 
prevention measures help protect our 
customers, employees and investors so that 
we can continue to deliver on our promise to 
do the right thing.THE LITTLE CALL CENTER THAT COULD: 
OMAHA CELEBRATES 15 YEARS
As the nation dealt with extreme weather 
that resulted in the Columbus Call Center 
closing one day in September 2017, the 
100-member Omaha Call Center kept lines of 
communication open. By handling increased 
call volume with efficiency, determination and 
expertise, they proved that for Aflac, delivering 
an outstanding customer experience 
comes first.
Fifteen years ago, Aflac moved its state of 
domicile from Georgia to Nebraska and 
opened a call center.
In 2008, a Policy Services unit moved in. The 
result: a Midwest facility that allows Aflac 
customers from various time zones to contact 
Aflac at the times most convenient for them. 
And as we found out in September, it provides 
crucial backup for our Columbus facility.
Omaha marked 15 years of such successes 
in October 2017 by hosting Aflac Customer 
Service management and others during its 
State of the Department meeting. Also on 
hand were three employees who have been 
at the Omaha facility since it opened its 
doors. The celebration provided the perfect 
opportunity to reflect on their time at Aflac.Celebrating 15 years of service, the Omaha team reflects 
on their tenure at Aflac.

2017 AWARDS AND HONORS
Aflac’s employees have the opportunity to make a difference in the 
everyday lives of those who have placed their trust in us. It’s a feel-good 
moment each time we receive a letter or phone call from someone who 
made it through tough times with the help of payments from an Aflac policy. 
While we view it as our job and responsibility, it’s always nice to receive 
affirmation from external sources that we’re doing a good job and have 
earned respect. Aflac received dozens of awards in 2017. Among the 
most notable:
The Harvard Business Review’s list of the 100 Best-Performing 
CEOs in the World.  We know our CEO Dan Amos is the cat’s meow … er, 
the Duck’s quack … and we’re glad others recognize it, too.
Ethisphere Magazine’s list of Attorneys Who Matter.  Audrey 
Boone Tillman, our very own general counsel, received the honor for two 
consecutive years – and most deservedly so.
Aflac ranked 33rd out of 500 companies in the United States and 49th 
out of 500 companies globally in  Newsweek’s Green Rankings. 
The Newsweek Green Rankings are one of the world’s most recognized 
assessments of corporate environmental performance.

INNOVATION AND TRANSFORMATION
We know that getting to the top of an industry isn’t nearly as 
tough as staying there. We must work harder, faster and smarter to 
maintain our position as more competitors enter the voluntary 
insurance marketplace. 
Innovation is critical for us, and we’re always looking for ways to 
improve how we do business. Some examples include: 
• We pioneered SmartApp® , which accelerates the application 
process for new policyholders. For doing so, we received the 
Computerworld Smithsonian Award for Excellence in Technology 
from the Smithsonian Institute in 1999.
• In September 2017, Aflac launched its first Aflac SmartClaim® 
Mobile App . Aflac employees, who were given the first opportunity 
to use the app and submit claims, advised the project team of 
relevant feedback, enabling us to ensure external customers would 
receive excellent experiences with the new app when it launched 
to the public in late 2017. The mobile claims app provides Aflac 
customers with the opportunity to submit claims, upload supporting 
documents, manage and recover their password, set up direct 
deposit and view the message center via mobile devices.
• In 2017, Aflac celebrated two years of offering One Day PaySM, 
which has resulted in nearly 2 million Aflac policyholders receiving 
benefits within just a day of filing eligible claims. That means 
about 2 million people were able to move on with their lives 
quickly after an injury or illness. As you might imagine, receiving 
benefits payments in just a day goes a long way toward helping 
policyholders breathe sighs of relief in difficult times.*• In 2017, we launched Aflac Ventures to identify and fund emerging 
technologies that make sense to support the future of our business. 
Through this program, Aflac announced a $100 million Venture 
Capital Fund , headquartered in Charlotte. Aflac Corporate Ventures 
is pursuing investment opportunities with early stage companies 
whose mission is relevant to Aflac’s core business and is designed 
to help the company enhance its strategic and innovative focus. As 
part of that mission, Aflac unveiled its newly renovated high-tech 
offices for Empowered, a benefits administration and enrollment 
software company owned by Aflac Inc., located in Charlotte, North 
Carolina. Following a $3 million investment to accommodate 
recent growth for the business, the new office space reflects the 
company’s status as a digital, full-service transformation company.

Financial Officer Fred Crawford (R) unveil the newly renovated offices for

*One Day PaySM is available for certain individual claims submitted online through the Aflac SmartClaim® process. Claims may be eligible for One Day Pay processing if submitted online through 
Aflac SmartClaim, including all required documentation, by 3 p.m. ET. Documentation requirements vary by type of claim; please review requirements for your claim(s) carefully. Aflac SmartClaim is 
available for claims on most individual Accident, Cancer, Hospital, Specified Health, and Intensive Care policies. Processing time is based on business days after all required documentation needed 
to render a decision is received and no further validation and/or research is required. Individual Company Statistic, 2018.14 | 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report
MORE THAN A PROMISEGOVERNANCE
I can’t tell you how much we appreciate 
my Aflac cancer and short-term disability 
insurance policies, which have helped 
make my and my family’s life less 
stressful during my times of illness, 
surgery and injury. I am a registered 
nurse of 33 years, employed as a school 
nurse-teacher in the Coventry, Rhode 
Island, school system, and understand 
how physically, emotionally and 
financially draining illness, surgery or 
injury can be to families. Two years ago, 
I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and 
a functioning adenoma (tumor) on my 
parathyroid gland at the same time. I had 
double neck surgery, which happened 
at the worst possible time - two weeks 
before my daughter’s law school 
graduation, less than two months before 
her bridal shower and three months 
before her wedding. I was very busy and 
stressed about these upcoming events 
and didn’t need the financial burden 
of cancer, surgery and being out of 
work. Aflac was incredibly fast and not 
argumentative in delivering my 
benefit checks.
  
The benefits helped us get through this 
busy time period, and it also helped make me less stressed, which speeded 
my recovery. 
I also had an unfortunate period within 
the last year, with more surgeries 
and then an injury. Again, Aflac to the 
rescue. I’m enrolled in a master’s degree 
program in nursing and had just taken 
out a considerable educational loan. 
I was worried about how my time out 
of work was going to affect this and 
other loans, financial obligations and 
household and car expenses. Not to 
worry, as I had my Aflac benefit check 
within a week of receiving all the 
needed claims forms.
I owe a very special thanks for all of 
my claims to Mark Tagliaferri, the Aflac 
school district agent. He walked me 
through the claims processes and 
assured me that it would be OK, even 
through my hysterical tears when I 
thought I wouldn’t be able to attend my 
daughter’s law school graduation, bridal 
shower and wedding. 
Thanks, Aflac, for you and your 
employees being there when we 
need you.Mary J. - Rhode IslandHere are some examples of how Aflac’s insurance plans have helped deliver our promise to policyholders. 
I’d advise anyone: 
“Make time to apply 
for Aflac now - aren’t 
you and your family 
worth it?”2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 15 
GOVERNANCE MORE THAN A PROMISE
When my husband applied for the Aflac 
accident insurance policy, I wasn’t sure about 
it. Did we need it? Nevertheless, when I hurt 
my knee in an accident, I was sure glad we had 
the additional coverage.
It has been 6 months of doctor visits and 
intensive therapy to get me back to walking. I 
cannot say how grateful I am that my husband 
had the forethought to apply for Aflac. We 
utilized the coverage for the care and consults 
necessary for my treatment. Aflac was able to 
benefit us for almost every visit.
I really want to thank our representative 
Marianne, as she was on top of each of my 
appointments. I never had to ask where 
payments were, as benefit checks just showed 
up in our mailbox after filing the claims.
Thank you again for your amazing customer 
service!
Tracey L.  - MichiganCancer wreaks havoc on health, 
emotions and finances. When given 
the diagnosis, Tim and I couldn’t 
think clearly for days. We did know 
for certain that we were thankful 
that we added him to my Aflac 
cancer insurance policy 11 months 
prior. I contacted Nikki Moellering, 
our Aflac insurance agent. She 
“held my hand” every step. With 
everything going on in our lives, I 
appreciate how easy the process is.
Aflac pays. It has only been 2 
1/2 months since we started this 
journey and we have already 
received substantial benefits. The 
website is very easy to navigate 
and breaks down each payment. 
Benefits pay on diagnosis, 
treatment, hospitalization, 
continuing care and lodging.
We have excellent health insurance 
through our major medical health 
care insurance company, but our 
out-of-pocket expenses are adding 
up quickly. Our Aflac payments are 
helping us to keep the bills paid. We 
are soon headed for surgery, and 
Tim will not be able to work for 4-5 
months. Having the Aflac benefits 
will help with the loss of income.For the average family income, 
one may wonder if there is room in 
the budget for one more monthly 
premium. For us, it has been the 
best investment we ever made. 
Prior to needing the policy, that 
premium was peace of mind.
Cancer attacks the body and we 
fight back with medical science. 
Cancer attacks our emotional 
state and we fight back with the 
prayers and support of family and 
friends. Cancer attacks our finances 
and Aflac helps fight back with 
generous benefits.
Thank you, Aflac, for being our ally 
in this battle.

ABOUT THE AFLAC CORPORATE SOCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEE  
Aflac’s Corporate Social Responsibility 
Committee is chaired by President and CEO of Communicorp and Senior Vice President of 
Shared Services Eric Seldon and is comprised 
of company officers who represent various Aflac 
stakeholder groups: 
• Senior vice president of Brand and 
Communications (the community at large);
• Senior vice president of Human Resources 
(employees);
• Vice president of Facilities (environment);
• Vice president of Government Relations 
(government);
• Vice president of Strategic Sourcing and 
Procurement (suppliers);
• Director of Corporate Communications 
(public affairs); 
• Senior manager of Corporate Social 
Responsibility (society).
The CSR Committee uses the ISO 26000 Social 
Responsibility Guidelines to inform Aflac’s 
CSR progress.
This team guides Aflac’s CSR reporting initiatives 
and provides information for Aflac’s Annual 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report – the 
most comprehensive document providing 
examples of our company’s corporate character. 
It offers stakeholders an annual view of efforts 
to improve our environmental stewardship and 
social responsibility, which continue to impact 
our reputation. It serves as a record of where we 
are today and points to where we want to be in 
the future.
For Aflac, social responsibility is not a one-and-
done effort that ends with this document, but a 
year-round committment to taking stock of our 
business, ourselves and its effect on others.20 | 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report
At Aflac, we believe that the work that we do 
has a greater purpose than simply meeting 
the bottom line. We value investing in our 
employees so they can return that investment 
by making impactful contributions to the 
business and the communities we serve.It is vital that we prioritize strategic thinking for 
future growth, which we do every day through 
our Vision 2020 initiative. 
It is our goal to maintain our position as the No. 
1 multichannel distributor of benefits solutions 
in the U.S. workforce. But part of our strategy 
is to ensure that we continue to do business 
the right way and that we fortify our workforce 
with an array of talent that is ready to lead us 
into the next decade and beyond. I’m proud to 
work for a company that fosters an inclusive 
culture that embraces diversity. 
In this chapter, you will see how Aflac provides 
the right resources to employees for their 
continued learning and success. We’ll break-
down our workforce demographics and hiring 
practices, showing how our success is driven by 
diversity at every level. And finally, we’ll look at 
the programs and opportunities that encourage 
dialogue about our differences helping us 
become better collaborators with one another.

As a top employer in the insurance industry, we recognize that a sound 
compensation process is a big part of what makes Aflac an employer of 
choice and ensures that we provide equal pay for equal work.
Aflac has ensured transparency and fairness in pay for key company decision-makers since 2008 
through an annual shareholder vote on the compensation of the top executives in the company. 
Considerations for annual raises and bonuses are linked to individual performance at every level. 
As a result, Aflac is able to attract, retain, motivate and reward individuals who have the skills to 
help manage and grow Aflac’s global business. Compensation processes are detailed on the 
following page.
Aflac’s Sherricka Day is a gatekeeper between the 
Legal and Government Regulations departments, 
working to ensure legislation that affects Aflac’s 
business operations is tracked, interpreted 
correctly, shared and implemented within.
Just as Sherricka works hard to manage 
regulations within the company, she works hard to 
ensure her team members are appreciated along 
the way. Through interdepartmental competitions, 
Employee Appreciation Week and a variety of 
other events, Sherricka embodies Aflac’s long-
time mantra — when you take care of your 
employees, they take care of your business.  
Her eye for detail and dedication to servant 
leadership at work extends to helping kids in her

communication skills, how to budget and how to 
interact with customers, which prepare them for 
the real world.

At Aflac, we believe that we set a tone for our 
commitment to diversity through our internship 
program. We continue to partner with community 
organizations and local and national colleges 
and universities to recruit qualified and diverse 
candidates. 
In 2017, Aflac welcomed 50 interns – the largest 
intern class to date. They represented more 
than 15 universities and worked in 25 different 
departments. Thirty-five of them worked in 
Columbus, eight in Global Investments, five with 
Aflac Group, one in Federal Relations and one

CELEBRATING AFLAC’S DIVERSITY  
Employees who understand, respect and take 
part in each other’s cultural traditions work 
better together. That’s why our diversity efforts 
don’t stop with our hiring practices. 
In 2017, we celebrated ethnicities, cultures and 
heritages in many ways: 
The Diversity Council (DC)  was designed 
to promote internal and external diversity 
initiatives and serves to support and enhance 
Aflac’s business processes and community 
involvement. The DC developed and 
implemented educational sessions such as the 
Women’s Tea, Men’s Coffee, Diversity Week, 
Disability Month among other events to raise 
awareness and educate our workforce on 
the importance of fostering an inclusive work culture. In fact, 45% of Aflac’s employees are 
ethnic minorities.
 
Aflac’s Diversity World Fair  showcased 
traditions and celebrations native to countries 
around the world, providing information on their 
history, clothing, food and games. Employees 
tried on traditional garments from South 
America, Japan and Hawaii, tasted various 
cuisines and even learned some native dances.
Additionally, the DC hosted an Aflac Japan Fun 
Booth to educate U.S. employees on customs 
and traditions practiced by their Japanese 
colleagues. The booth included trivia, an 
etiquette activity and Japanese treats. More 
than 280 employees participated. 
Aflac was also a sponsor of the Tri-City Latino 
Festival , which was created five years ago 
to bring awareness and education to the 
community by celebrating the history and the diversity among the 21 nations that constitute 
the Latino cultures. The Aflac DC was on hand 
for a taste of live Latin music and traditional 
dances. Many said that it was a great way to 
promote unity while also having family fun.
The annual Aflac Tower Lighting  brought 
employees and the community of Columbus 
together as children from the Child Care Center 
performed holiday songs, Santa posed for 
photos and attendees enjoyed free food in 
celebration of the holiday season. 
In honor of Aflac employees who are military 
veterans, we hosted a Veteran’s Day Breakfast  
to celebrate, recognize and honor the sacrifices 
they and fellow veterans have made for all 
Americans.
The Aflac Diversity Council meets to discuss planning 
efforts for Aflac Diversity Week, a cultural celebration.Employees learn about other cultures and customs during

SUPPORTING DIVERSITY IN THE COMMUNITY  
Aflac is committed to investing in our local community through 
contributions to various minority events and organizations. 
In 2017, Aflac made the following commitments and contributions:SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
Aflac’s commitment to diversity extends to the companies with which we 
do business. While it’s not the only factor we consider, diversity remains 
a major part of our selection process. As part of Aflac’s daily operations, 
our employees manage and connect with an increasingly diverse set of 
accounts, customers and communities.
Aflac’s support for diverse suppliers is embodied by our Supplier Diversity 
Program, a mentorship opportunity for small, minority-owned businesses; 
our Supplier Code of Conduct , which outlines ethical standards for 
becoming an Aflac supplier; and our participation in national trade shows 
and business development events. 
PROVIDING THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED
At Aflac, we don’t want to simply hire good people; we want to keep good 
people. To that end, we have many programs in place designed to help 
employees define and achieve their career goals. 
Programs include: 
Career Success Centers
Aflac’s Career Success Centers in Columbus, Georgia, and Columbia, 
South Carolina, are fully staffed career counseling offices that have helped 
more than 1,200 employees earn promotions since opening in 2015. The 
centers empower employees to take charge of their careers by providing 
in-person counseling sessions, résumé development, interview practice 
and interactive career development workshops.MORE THAN A PROMISE

services to grow and advance their careers within the company.
Aleta  joined the Aflac family just two years ago. She started out in the 
Customer Service Center, and her motto is “The more you know the more 
you grow.” It’s fitting, as her ultimate goal is to become a corporate trainer

business with Tier 1 diverse suppliers, with 
women-owned businesses making up 47% of 
the $15 million diversity spend. $258, 000+
For 2017 , Aflac made $258, 000+ in donations to minority events and organizations supporting

SUPPLIER SPOTLIGHT
Aflac announced NIIT Technologies as one of five “Partners of the Year” for 
their exceptional work and services, which help drive high-quality results 
for the company. NIIT Technologies is a digital services company that helps 
businesses design agile, scalable and digital operating models. When NIIT 
isn’t leading the global IT solutions industry and revolutionizing the way 
businesses use technology, they are giving back to the community.
NIIT’s commitment to corporate social responsibility is focused on four 
pillars: education, employability, infrastructure enhancement and local 
initiatives. NIIT encourages its employees to become involved with these 
initiatives by providing them with days of paid CSR leave so they can freely 
devote their time and efforts to supporting NGOs of their choice. 
Additionally, the company supports NIIT University, a nonprofit institution 
that promotes learning while improving the quality of high education around 
research, technology and sustainability. NIIT also invests talent and money 
in supporting various initiatives for underprivileged areas of society. MORE THAN A PROMISE

interview practice and feedback, to helping her successfully prepare 
for her new role as field commissions specialist II. Exploring Aflac’s 
university partnership opportunities with help from the center is the next 
step in her plan of pursuing a Bachelor of Business Management. 
For 13 years, Dawn  focused her talents in Aflac’s Policy Service division 
– a focus she’s recently expanded to better align her professional 
career with personal interests. Holding a Master of Healthcare and 
Administration, as well as maintaining certification as a medical biller and 
coder, Dawn is now applying her talents and education in her new role 
as claims specialist. She also credits the résumé writing, mock interviews 
and career management support she received from the Career Success 
Center as key in helping to position herself for continued growth with 
Aflac.
Eric has been with Aflac for 20 years and knows firsthand that changes 
in the business environment can lead to new opportunities – as long as 
you’re flexible, open to growth and willing to learn. In fact, he was one of 
the first Aflac employees to transfer from Columbus to Columbia, South 
Carolina. It was a move he saw as an exciting opportunity to broaden 
his knowledge and experience. He is currently working toward a Master 
of Business Administration in Management, and his goal is to become a 
manager. His recent promotion to lead invoice specialist is just the latest 
step in that journey and one in which the Career Success Center played 
a role. Like the others, Eric believes taking advantage of the direction 
and support provided by the Career Success Center is key in growing 
with the company.
“The Career Success Center 
is there to help you grow. Take 
a chance on yourself and use 
the many tools available.”  
- Aleta Terry“The Career Success Center 
is one of the best things Aflac 
has done for employees. Take 
the first step and set up an 
appointment.”  
- Dawn Brown“No matter your title (i.e, 
specialist, supervisor, manager, 
VP, etc.) everyone can walk away 
from the Career Success Center 
with something valuable.”  
- Eric Holt30 | 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report
TEACH Mentorship Program  
Aflac’s premier mentoring program, called TEACH, allows employees 
to teach what they know and learn what they don’t. Ethnic minorities 
make up 65.2 percent of TEACH mentors and women make up 73.5 
percent.
Real Talk  
Real Talk offers employees an open forum to make connections with 
senior leaders through small-group settings that foster opportunities for 
growth. In 2017, Aflac hosted more than 20 Real Talk sessions focused 
on personal career development, mentorship, strategic thinking, 
business etiquette and effective communication.
Reverse-Mentoring
Aflac Information Technology (IT) developed and implemented a 
reverse-mentoring program that jump-started Aflac’s approach to 
skill-sharing. The program pairs 470 seasoned IT employees — whose 
average age is 48 — with “apprentices,” most of whom are recent 
college graduates. The structure fosters a knowledge exchange about 
technology, leadership, teamwork and office etiquette.
Apprentices work with IT staff in two-year rotations. They move from 
team to team every few months to get a feel for the nuances that are 
particular to different roles, company operations and corporate culture. 
The program has been so successful that it’s become common for 
multiple managers to request an apprentice as their team member. And 
across the board, this competition for talent compels managers to be 
the kind of leaders for whom apprentices strive to work.

Leadership, Learning and Development  
Because quality leadership is vital to building and retaining a top-
notch workforce, we also devote resources to helping team leaders 
become stronger managers. To that end, 2017 marked two years since 
we launched our Leadership, Learning and Development initiative, a 
program that teaches key management skills and conflict resolution at 
Aflac’s Columbus office. And in response to demand for this program, 
Aflac began exploring how it can be expanded to fulfill interest at the 
Columbia, South Carolina, campus. Aflac’s reverse-mentoring program connects employees of all career stages. Whether 
entry-level or veteran staff, each participant learns something new.
Employees learn about diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
Diversity Training 
Led by the Director of Diversity and Employee Engagement, Aflac 
hosts annual diversity training seminars to educate new leaders about 
diversity, inclusiveness and engagement. Courses on diversity are 
also offered through the Leadership, Learning and Development team. 
In 2017, the training was extended to senior managers, second vice 
presidents and directors.2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 31

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
The Aflac Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (our “Code”) shows 
employees how to apply the company’s founding values that include 
teamwork, respect, fairness, honesty, integrity and responsibility to 
everyday business conduct. By choosing to work at Aflac, employees 
have made a commitment to ethical and lawful business conduct, and all 
are expected to understand and follow the policies set forth in the Code. 
Every Aflac employee is required to complete annual web-based training, 
confirming their understanding of these important policies.
Aflac Quest 
Team-building and skills-assessment are combined in the Aflac Quest 
— an interactive activity to reinforce teamwork, problem-solving and 
conflict-resolution skills. This hands-on activity is a fun learning tool that 
encourages teams to work together to resolve problems and develop a 
succession plan during a crisis scenario.
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND RETENTION 
Listening to our employees about what they want and need from their 
workplace helps teams and leaders foster a positive work environment. 
More than two-thirds of employees responded to the 2017 Employee 
Engagement Survey, sharing thoughts on areas where Aflac is excelling 
and noting areas for improvement: 
• 94% say they feel proud to be part of Aflac
 
• 90%  say they are treated with dignity and respect at work
• 90%  agree that Aflac values diversity in gender, race, thought and 
experience
• 91% would recommend Aflac as a great place to work
 
• 76% say they are satisfied with their work environment (up 2% from 
2015)
 
• 64% agree that there is good collaboration across divisions (up 3% 
from 2015) Insights from Employee Engagement Surveys have shaped teambuilding 
activities, employee benefits and on-campus perks that provide deeper 
connections, peace of mind and convenience. 
Here are some examples of how we’ve acted on these insights: 
Employee Appreciation Week  
• Aflac rewards its employees each year in May with a celebration. For 
five days, the company hosts themed events, games and raffles for 
prizes such as high-tech electronics, gift cards and paid vacations. 
Perks for Parents 
• We target initiatives geared toward improving the workplace for both 
men and women, such as our Domestic Partner Leave and our Parental 
Leave policy, which includes salary continuation for both parents for 
the birth and adoption of a child. 
• Aflac has two on-site child care centers at its headquarters in 
Columbus, Georgia. Nearly 300 children attend these care centers 
during the workday. 
• And on-site clinics makes nipping that illness in the bud that much 
quicker. MORE THAN A PROMISE

Aflac receives the 2017 Partners In Education Award. Recipients also 
included the RiverCenter for the Performing Arts and Columbus High 
School. In December 2016, I was 490 pounds 
and needed to lose weight.
After a trip to the ER for a heart issue, 
my family pressured me to consider 
bariatric surgery. I completed the initial 
informational seminar, but after receiving 
more information, I decided I’d rather 
lose the weight through healthy lifestyle 
modifications.
For support in this change, I went to the 
Aflac Care Center on campus. During 
my first visit, I learned my blood pressure 
was extremely high –  a result of stopping 
my blood pressure medications due to 
anxiety side effects. Sabrina Hilbert, my 
health coach, helped me find the right 
medication.
After gaining control of my blood 
pressure, I continued to meet with 
Sabrina to work toward my weight-loss 
goal. I decreased my soda intake, drank 
more water, cooked at home and 
avoided takeout foods. I added regular 
cardiovascular exercise into my daily 
routine! Now, I have the endurance to 
play three or four flag football games 
each weekend with my recreational flag 
football league.
I am proud to say I have lost nearly 100 
pounds since January 2017. My anxiety 
has decreased and my energy level has 
improved significantly.
In the past, I lost weight to prove a point 
instead of losing it for myself. Each 
person needs to find his or her own 
wake-up call. I’m still on my journey, 
but I have focused on creating a mind, 
body and soul connection with my new 
healthy lifestyle, and I never plan to go 
back. 
The Greater Columbus GA “Partners in Education” (PIE) 
Program was established in 1987 as a joint venture of the 
Muscogee County School District and the Greater Columbus 
GA Chamber of Commerce to improve education by stimulating 
meaningful business and community involvement in public 
schools.
 
Since the program’s establishment, the program has grown 
exponentially, with more than 285 partners involved, including 
Aflac, and more than 80 schools engaged across seven 
school districts. As of the 2016-2017 school year the program 
represents a total estimated value of more than $755,000 
from time, financial contributions, and donations of goods and 
services given back to our schools. 
 
PIE is based on the concept that “Human Capital” is the most 
important resource a partner can provide – a concept that 
aligns strongly with the importance Aflac places on its own 
workforce. Although some businesses provide funding for 
specific needs, the greatest benefit to education is derived 
from the personal involvement of volunteers in schools.
Partnerships provide an enriching educational experience for 
students aimed at improving levels of academic achievement, 
self-esteem and understanding of the expectations of the work 
world.

I’ve always believed that learning is a never-
ending process, so that’s why I decided to 
go back to school for a Master of Business 
Administration at CSU after graduating with 
my undergraduate degree many years earlier. 
I was already enrolled and attending classes 
before hearing about Aflac’s scholarship and 
tuition reimbursements from colleagues at work 
— some of whom were already reimbursement 
recipients themselves. I am honored to be 
awarded the reimbursement scholarship and 
blessed to be able to go and fully apply myself 
to an education that will improve my future.
—Ross Pinney, Paul S. Amos Tuition 
Reimbursement Program (CSU) recipientI always planned to go back and finish my 
education, and I took steps to do so in 2015 
by enrolling at Troy University. To help with 
the financial burden, I researched possible 
scholarships and was excited to find one 
offered through Aflac that I was eligible for 
and eventually received. Aflac understands 
that as a company, when you invest in your 
employees, they invest back in you. In my 12 
years here, I am able to be more innovative 
and creative in my work, bringing the things 
I learned in the classroom into my job. It’s an 
amazing feeling to be able to fulfill a lifelong 
dream, and I will be forever grateful to Aflac 
for offering me the chance to make that 
happen.

WORKPLACE
When I was in school, I saw firsthand how other 
people struggled to keep up with both the 
financial and academic demands of going to 
college. Being an Aflac scholarship recipient 
allowed me to focus solely on school, so I didn’t 
have to worry about picking up an extra shift 
at work or falling behind on my schoolwork. 
Thanks to this scholarship and my hard work 
and dedication, I’m proud to say I graduated 
magna cum laude and debt-free. Aflac and Mr. 
Amos help young adults to grow into people 
who can serve the community. He invests in us 
so we can return the investment by contributing 
our time, skills and efforts. Now, as a registered 
nurse at Piedmont Columbus Regional, I have 
the opportunity to give back to the community 
just like Aflac did for me.
—Kayla Tew, W. L. Amos Dependent Scholarship 
(dependent of Aflac employee Judy Tew)

As a first-generation college student, this 
scholarship provided me with the support and 
motivation I needed to complete my degree. As 
an Aflac scholarship recipient, we are expected 
to meet certain requirements in order to keep 
our scholarship, and those are what reminded 
me to push forward, keep my standards high and 
continuously work hard. Working at Aflac while 
attending school has exposed me to a wealth of 
knowledge and has encouraged me to pursue a 
career in medicine. I have a passion for helping 
others. Working at Aflac has allowed me to serve 
people as a customer service representative, 
and now, through this scholarship, Aflac is 
allowing me to one day help people in other 
ways. Aflac laid the foundation for my future, so 
my hope is that other first-generation students 
will see what I was able to accomplish and feel 
inspired to do the same thing.

“character” — ethics, inclusion, philanthropy 
and sustainability — to propel us yet another 
step further. In 2018 and beyond, Aflac is 
making a dedicated effort to share examples 
of “strong character” with a young audience, 
translating what makes Aflac ethical, generous, 
welcoming, and green into relatable and fun

Success isn’t just weighed by dollars and 
cents. It’s also weighed by societal impact. 
And without question, Aflac has had a 
tremendously positive impact. As an institution, 
we believe in giving back — whether that’s 
through donations to cancer research 
initiatives, funding programs that support 
families in treatment, or working to raise 
awareness of important issues like gender 
equality and federal research funding for new 
childhood cancer medicines. 
102-14PHILANTHROPY:
DOING GOOD BY
GIVING BACK
For more than 20 years, Aflac has championed 
the childhood cancer cause. It began when a 
young mother, Vicki Riedel, reached out to Aflac 
seeking support in her personal fight against 
childhood cancer. 
Riedel’s baby daughter, Ansley, was undergoing 
treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia 
(AML) at what is today Children’s Healthcare of 
Atlanta. The cancer treatment floor was in need 
of renovations, and Riedel reached out to Aflac 
to request a $25,000 donation from Aflac to get 
the job done. 
Touched by Riedel’s story and desire to help, 
Aflac pledged $3 million to renovate the cancer 
treatment wing in Atlanta, which today is named 
the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center 
(Aflac Cancer Center). 
By 2017, Aflac had donated more than $123 
million for the research and treatment of 
childhood cancer.
Amanda Gordy had been an Aflac 
employee for three years and enjoyed 
helping with fundraising efforts to 
support childhood cancer. It wasn’t until 
her 11 month-old daughter, Tynsley, was 
diagnosed with leukemia and spent more 
than a month in treatment at the Aflac 
Cancer Center in Atlanta that Amanda 
realized the impact of Aflac’s support 
for children like her daughter. Today, 
Amanda celebrates her daughter’s 
recovery and is dedicated to helping 
others who face similar challenges. She 
pays it forward by volunteering for the 
childhood cancer cause and spreading 
the word that Aflac is more than just an 
insurance company; it’s a family. 
PHILANTHROPY MORE THAN A PROMISE
“We vowed to help end childhood cancer 
20 years ago, and that is a promise we 
will continue to keep. Our employees and 
independent sales agents have taken up this 
cause as their own, showing the world how our 
Aflac family can make a difference for so many 
other families needing our help.” – Kathelen 
Amos, President of The Aflac Foundation, Inc.
Aflac employees and independent sales agents 
support this mission through volunteerism and 
voluntary donations. Each month, more than 
17,000 Aflac independent sales associates 
contribute more than $500,000 from their 
commission checks to the Aflac Cancer Center.

A BOLD NEW PROJECT:  
MY SPECIAL AFLAC DUCK  
In 2017, Aflac set out to create an innovative 
new way to support children and families 
on their childhood cancer journey. They 
partnered with patient-centered research and 
development company, Sproutel, to design 
and develop My Special Aflac Duck , a plush 
and robotic imitation of their iconic mascot. 
My Special Aflac Duck  is designed to help 
fill two important gaps – emotional support 
and medical play. The company expects to 
begin distributing My Special Aflac Duck to all 
newly diagnosed children from ages 3 to 13 in 
2018, at no cost to the recipients. On average, 
between 15,000 and 16,000 children are 
diagnosed with cancer each year, according to 
the National Cancer Institute.CUREFEST AND CHASING CANCER: 
ADVANCING THE NATIONAL  
DISCUSSION ON CANCER
Childhood cancer is the leading cause of death 
by disease for children under the age of 15, 
according to the National Cancer Institute’s A 
Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 2017 . Yet, less 
than 4 percent of all federal funding for cancer 
research goes toward pediatric cancer research 
(Children’s Cancer Fund). And according to the 
St. Baldrick’s Foundation, in the past 20 years, 
only three new drugs have been developed to 
treat childhood cancers.  
In 2017, Aflac expanded its support of this 
critical issue, elevating this discussion to a 
national conversation. For the second year, Aflac 
sponsored CureFest , an event by a grassroots 
organization that aims to make childhood 
cancer a federal funding priority by uniting the 
childhood cancer community, the general public, 
physicians, researchers and elected leaders.
CureFest is a two-day event held at Freedom 
Aflac marches against cancer at the Capitol during 
2017’s CureFest celebration.Plaza and at the National Mall in Washington, 
D.C. It includes three key events:  
 
“Night of Golden Lights,” which features live 
music and speakers, followed by a walk to the 
White House gates for a candlelight vigil; a 
gathering of more than 250 childhood cancer 
support organizations at the National Mall, 
where the Aflac Duck greeted attendees; and 
finally, a 5K walk that concluded the weekend. 
In September, Aflac worked with Atlantic 
Media  to create a panel program on the topic 
of childhood cancer. The discussion centered 
on how the U.S. health care system is shaped 
by a disease that touches the lives of millions 
of people and provided new insights on the 
challenges cancer presents.

LEAVING OUR ‘DUCKPRINTS’ 
Aflac’s support of childhood cancer is 
promised beyond the Aflac Cancer Center 
in Atlanta through its Duckprints initiative, a 
traveling and digital effort to raise awareness. 
Through Duckprints, the Aflac Duck visits 
children’s hospitals nationwide to honor and 
celebrate individuals who go above and 
beyond to help put an end to this disease.
 
In 2017, Aflac and its partners hosted four 
Duckprints events to celebrate cancer-fighting 
heroes at the Cottage Children’s Medical 
Center in Santa Barbara, California; the Dayton 
Children’s Hospital in Dayton, Ohio; Palmetto 
Health in Columbia, South Carolina; and Aflac 
Cancer Center in Atlanta, Georgia.  
Online, the Duckprints  campaign rallies people 
across America to become active in pediatric 
cancer issues by encouraging social media 
users to create or share posts related to 
childhood cancer by using #Duckprints. For 
each use of the hashtag, Aflac pledged to 
contribute $2, up to $1.5 million total, to  
The Aflac Foundation, Inc. for the cause.  
 
All told, there were more than 900,000 
social media engagements across Facebook, 
Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, making 2017 
the second consecutive year the Duckprints 
program, which started in 2013, reached its

proud to honor local heroes, including 
two former patients, Faith DeBrum and 
Jasmin Castro, who have participated 
in vital fundraising projects and Anita 
Williamson, who provides patients with 
Loving Tabs shirts designed for easy 
catheter port access during treatment. Jasmin Castro  was rushed to the closest 
emergency room when she was just 1 year 
old for unexplained bleeding. She was quickly 
transferred to nearby Cottage Children’s 
Medical Center, where doctors discovered and 
diagnosed an egg-sized germ cell tumor.
Jasmin spent a month undergoing intense 
chemotherapy to save her life. She overcame 
the odds but faced another challenge years 
later when she turned 15. That’s when Jasmin 
collapsed from an aneurysm.
Again she was taken to Cottage, where she 
spent a little more than three weeks in the ICU in 
an induced coma. Afterwards, she had to relearn 
how to walk and talk.

said. 
Anita contacted her friends, Diane and Richard

organization helps low-income and underserved 
families meet basic needs associated with caring 
for a sick child, and it honors the memory of the 
couple’s 5-year-old son, who passed away due 
to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Through 
the Emilio Nares Foundation, Anita purchased 
and then donated to Cottage Children’s Medical 
Center a total of 300 soft, colorful Loving Tabs 
T-shirts designed with snap openings at the 
shoulder and sleeve to allow for easy port 
access during infusion treatments. 
Thanks to Anita’s generosity, patients at 
Cottage’s Grotenhuis Pediatric Clinics are able to 
receive the garments for free and can take them 
home and reuse them for future treatments. 
Anita plans to establish a program that will 
continue to benefit all children undergoing 
cancer treatment in the future, which will 
enhance the comfort of pediatric patients.Craig Q. King  discovered his purpose at 17 years 
old: to inspire, teach and serve the people of the 
world. Today, he lives his purpose and considers 
it a gift given to him by cancer.  
In 1999, Craig was diagnosed with 
osteosarcoma, a type of bone tumor. After 
his left tibia and kneecap were removed 
and reconstructed, he began a year of 
chemotherapy in the Children’s Center for 
Cancer and Blood Disorders at Palmetto 
Health Children’s Hospital. This life-changing 
experience opened Craig’s heart to selfless 
giving. After completing treatment and learning 
to walk again, Craig was inspired to become a 
mentor and counselor in 2001 for CAMP KEMO, 
an annual camp for children facing cancer and 
their siblings. Soon after, Craig co-founded 
“Craig Q. King’s Celebration of Life Gala” with his 
mother, Paulette King. Over the years since his 
diagnosis, Craig and his family have raised more

charitable organizations.
Julian E. Ruffin, Ph.D.,  began his relationship 
with Palmetto Health Children’s Hospital as a 
volunteer in 1981. Then, he was working as the 
director of the Child and Adolescent division 
of Columbia Area Mental Health Center and 
spent his lunch breaks working with patients 
and families who were having a difficult time 
emotionally during treatment. This fueled his 
desire to get more involved. In 1983, he became 
a volunteer counselor with the adolescent boys 
at CAMP KEMO, a one-week summer camp for 
children with cancer and their siblings. CAMP 
KEMO became one of his greatest passions, 
both personally and professionally. Two years 
later, he was one of the co-founders of Lasting 
Impressions, a peer support group for teen 
cancer patients and survivors. In 1993, after 12 years of volunteering, he joined the Children’s 
Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders team 
as coordinator of psychosocial programs and 
clinical associate professor of pediatrics with the 
USC School of Medicine.
In the years that followed, Julian developed 
other innovative programs such as the 
“Gather, Relax and Come Eat” (GRACE) dinner; 
“HUGGIES,” a parent support group for those 
with pre-school children being treated for 
cancer; Family Weekend, a three-day retreat 
for newly diagnosed families to provide peer 
support, and Camp New Horizons, a weekend 
camp for children who have lost their siblings 
to cancer or a blood disorder. He continued 
his passion for CAMP KEMO by becoming 
the leader for the Counselors in Training 
(CITs) and was instrumental in advocating for 
a CAMP KEMO web page so parents could 
see pictures of their children participating at 
camp. Julian was also an active member of the 
Professional Advisory Group for the Pastoral 
Care department and served as chair of this 
group for many years. He also led seminars on 
grief and loss in children for clinical pastoral 
education students and medical residents. Now 
retired, Julian is spending some of his free time 
volunteering with the Palmetto Conservation 
Foundation and as a disaster mental health 
volunteer with the American Red Cross.  
Grainne and Clay Owens’  lives took a significant 
detour when they lost their son, Killian, to

social responsibility, as our efforts to limit the

reputation and, in turn, corporate success. 
From the materials we use in our daily 
operations to the construction and 
management of our facilities, we carefully 
consider the environmental impact of our 
actions – not only for today, but in the years 
to come. Our ultimate goal is to help make 
our communities, our cities and even our 
planet a better place.Now more than ever, businesses look to 
work with other companies that reflect their 
values, and consumers come to expect 
preventative and proactive methods that 
leave the world better than we found it.
Notable gains at Aflac in 2017 include the 
installation of 500 solar panels on one 
of our Columbus buildings and progress 
in ISO environmental management 
certification for Aflac facilities. We expect 
to receive our ISO 14000 status in 2018.

portfolio score to 86, which is more than 
a 60 percent improvement over our 2007 
baseline score.

INCREASING ENERGY SAVINGS 
Aflac became the first insurance company 
in the United States to be ISO 50001 Energy 
Management System registered, which 
represents the latest best practice in energy 
management.
Through sustained and deliberate energy-
saving measures, the company has reduced 
electricity consumption by 46 percent per 
square foot since 2007, saving Aflac nearly 
$12 million in nine years.  And as buildings are 
remodelled, Aflac implements energy-saving 
ideas such as task light motion sensors in 
cubicles and motion sensors in restrooms, 
copy rooms and parking garages. Our heating 
and cooling systems are powered down 
during off hours. In 2012, we implemented 
software to power down or place in low 
systems nearly 5,000 PCs at all corporate 
offices at night to further reduce energy. The 
software analyzes and reports on power 
usage and energy consumption across the 
enterprise and at a granular, device-by-device 
level. In addition, the IT department raised 
the temperature in the data center, reducing 
energy usage and costs associated with 
air cooling.
In 2017, Aflac installed an array of 500 solar 
panels  on top of a building in Columbus, 
Georgia, and began using solar energy to 
supplement electric power, providing 15 
percent of the building’s energy needs — 
enough to power 17 houses per year. Excess 
power created during the weekends is sold are submitted electronically, and more than 
80 percent of our new policy accounts receive 
their invoices online. The switch from paper 
to electronic transactions also saves on costs 
of photocopy toner, printer ink and postage —

In Aflac’s on-site cafeteria, an ORCA food 
digester turns food waste into grey water, 
which can be disposed through the city 
sewage system. The food digester is expected 
to divert up to 40,000 pounds of food waste 
from the landfill each year.
Recycling is part of Aflac’s waste reduction 
strategy that diverts approximately 1.5 million 
pounds of waste from the landfill annually. 
In addition to paper, Aflac employees are 
encouraged to collect the following materials 
for recycling:
• Newspaper.
• Cardboard.
• Fluorescent lamps.
• Toner and inkjet cartridges.
• Microfilm and recording tape.
• Ceiling tiles.
• Computer equipment.
• Pallets.
• Plastic bottles.
• Aluminum.
• Copper.

• Batteries.
• Carpet.
• Styrofoam.  back to the electricity provider. Solar energy 
production has exceeded initial expectations, 
and as a result, Aflac anticipates a return on 
this investment in less than six years. 
REDUCING WASTE AND RECYCLING
The majority of Aflac’s marketing materials 
and other mass-produced literature is printed 
on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified 
paper, but increased reliance on electronic 
instead of paper-based transactions has 
delivered significant environmental and cost-
saving impact.

In 2017, Aflac installed an array of 500 solar panels 
on top of a building and began using solar energy to 
supplement existing sources for electric power.

SUSTAINABILITY MORE THAN A PROMISE
Aflac’s recycling efforts have increased 
from 57 percent of all solid waste in 2009 
to 60 percent in 2017 , annually diverting 
approximately 881,631 pounds of waste from 
the landfill.
ENGAGING EMPLOYEES: TAKE ONLY 
MEMORIES, LEAVE ONLY DUCKPRINTS
To engage employees in green education 
and bring greater awareness to companywide 
sustainability activities, Aflac launched the 
“Take only memories, leave only duckprints”  
grassroots sustainability campaign in 2017. 
It kicked off with a video message by Eric 
Seldon, SVP of Shared Services, who 
oversees all sustainability activities for Aflac. 
Key activations included: 
• Sharing videos highlighting key green 
activities and documenting key “green” 
moments in time, including the solar panel 
installation, the Greenshortz video series – 
featuring educational DIY green activities 
– Earth Day, awards and recognition, and 
Aflac’s energy management program.  
• Launching the Aflac Greenbassador  
program, recruiting and tasking more than 
60 employees who support Aflac’s green 
goals with event coordination and program 
communication support.  
• Posting recycling informational signs 
throughout campuses, identifying 
correct bins for each item. Through the Greenbassador program, participants 
who shared their recycling activities and 
participation on Facebook were rewarded 
with prizes.  
• Hosting two key green educational events, 
the e-waste recycling event and the Earth 
Day vendor fair, offered employees and 
members of the community an opportunity 
to properly dispose of electronic waste 
that would likely end up in a landfill 
and learn about other ways to practice 
sustainability at home and the office. 
Aflac Green Committee educates employees about 
recycling best practices at the 2017 Earth Day booth.

KEEPING AFLAC’S 
PROMISE IN JAPANJAPAN MORE THAN A PROMISE
WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE
Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe first 
launched a national call to action to promote 
more women into Japanese leadership 
positions at companies in 2013. The 
campaign, referred to as “Womenomics,” 
encourages and empowers women to stay 
and advance in the workplace. The campaign 
requires firms with more than 300 employees 
to develop, announce and submit voluntary 
action plans to expand opportunities for 
women in the workplace. For Aflac, Prime Minister Abe’s 
Womenomics reaffirmed our position that 
female leaders should be celebrated, and 
when deserving, promoted.
In fact, at its inception in 1974, nine of the 
16 founding members of Aflac Japan were 
women. Twenty years later, Aflac became 
the first life insurance company in Japan to 
name a woman to an executive management 
position. Since then, the company’s executive 
management team has consistently included 
women, all promoted from within. Today, six 
women serve as members of Aflac Japan’s 
executive management team, including one 
officer who serves as president of an Aflac 
affiliate.
In 2014, in response to Prime Minister Abe’s 
call to action, Aflac Japan launched its 
“Women’s Empowerment Program” and has 
successfully helped raise the percentage 
of women in leadership positions from 
17.5 percent in 2014 to 26.2 percent as 
of July 2017. By 2020, Aflac’s goal is to 
achieve 30 percent  female leadership at 
the company through six areas of focus, 
including commitment to this initiative 
by top Aflac leaders: enhancing diversity 
promotion framework, ensuring management 
accountibility, development and training 
resources for women, encouraging diverse 
work styles and operational evaluation/ 
process visibility.In 2017, Aflac Japan’s six CSR team members 
championed local community engagement in 
Chofu City – a neighborhood close to Aflac 
Japan’s head office and home to many at the 
company. On Japan’s national Health Sports 
Day, the team organized an event to unite 
sports lovers for a day of fun and activity at 
every level, encouraging exercise and healthy 
living for the nearly 20,000 residents. The 
Aflac Sports Garden event included activities 
for children, paralympic athletes and even 
featured an appearance by the national 
Japanese Rugby Club. Funds raised that day 
went to local charities, including childhood 
cancer support and research. 
At its inception in 1974, nine of the 16 founding members 
of Aflac Japan were women.

THE AFLAC PARENTS HOUSE 
Since its founding in 2001, the Aflac Parents 
House has provided cheerful and spacious 
accommodations to pediatric patients and 
their families, allowing them to stay together 
in a comfortable home away from home while 
a child is fighting cancer or another serious 
illness. In Japan, children faced with a serious 
medical condition must often travel to receive 
treatment. Generous donations from Aflac 
Japan’s sales agents, employees and officers 
provide funding for three Parents House 
locations: two in Tokyo and one in Osaka. 
The support of dedicated staff and volunteers 
provides a welcoming setting where families 
can summon the resolve to sustain their 
treatment journeys. • The Nikkei Dual Ranking , 
which celebrates companies 
that support the child- 
rearing efforts of dual-
income couples. 
• In April 2017, Aflac Japan embraced the 
action declaration made by “Male Leaders 
Accelerating Women’s Empowerment.”  
The action declaration was made to 
express male leaders’ support of women in 
the workplace. To pursue this declaration, 
Aflac Japan’s management members 
visited operation bases nationwide and 
held discussions directly with employees 
about women’s empowerment.  
• In 2017, Aflac Japan demonstrated support 
for employee work-life balance by joining 
the Japan Ikuboss* Declaration Project , 
supported by the Ministry of Health, 
Labor and Welfare, and also by joining the 
Alliance of Ikuboss Companies, estalished 
by a nonprofit called Fathering Japan.
Aflac Parents House proudly hosts families in need, 
providing some bit of comfort to an unimaginable situation.
The company’s efforts have been noticed. 
To date, Aflac Japan has received several 
important accolades for the following efforts: 
• A special diversity award from 
the Japan Women’s Innovative 
Network  (J-Win) honoring 
management’s commitment to 
promoting women in leadership, 
engaging all levels of the company in 
meaningful efforts to advance women and 
enhancing the business culture. This is 
the second time Aflac Japan  received an 
award from J-Win.  
• Aflac Japan received the  
highest-level Eruboshi 
certification  in recognition 
of its efforts to promote 
the active participation 
of female employees, based on the Act 
to Promote the Active Participation of 
Women in the Workplace established on 
April 1, 2016. The act dictates that large 
companies with more than 300 employees 
must develop a plan to promote the active 
participation of their female employees. 
The Eruboshi certification system evaluates 
these plans and awards companies one of 
three levels of certification.  
• Named to the Ministry of Health, 
Labor and Welfare’s  list of the best 100 
companies concerned with women’s 
empowerment. Japanese and U.S. Leaders meet regularly to discuss 
business operations and corporate social responsibility, 
preparing for the coming years.

PATIENTS 
The Aflac Scholarship Fund for Childhood 
Cancer Survivors and Children of Cancer 
Victims was established to provide financial 
assistance to high school students who 
have lost a parent to cancer. The program 
distributes funds to recipients who meet a 
specified level of academic achievement, 
typically $225 (¥25,000) per month, until high 
school graduation to assist with educational 
and living expenses. 
Aflac Japan is proud to have provided this 
scholarship to more than 2,500 students.CANCER AWARENESS AND PREVENTION 
Aflac Japan’s partnerships with national 
and local governments and organizations 
reinforces its dedication and commitment to 
helping communities. Through these alliances, 
Aflac Japan increases cancer awareness, 
promotes early detection, and provides 
education to the public on prevention and 
treatment.
Since 1999, Aflac Japan has been hosting a 
“Classic Charity Concert” to support children 
and their families affected by childhood 
cancer. This event is held in Tokyo every 
year, and it features an array of talented 
entertainers year after year. In exchange for 
their generosity, patrons who made a donation 
at the concert received a plush Aflac Duck as 
a small token of gratitude. In 2017, 1,154 people 
participated in this concert and approximately $7,554 (¥841,624) was raised, all of which was 
used to fund hospitals, research efforts and 
childhood cancer support groups. 
Since 2007, exhibitions sponsored throughout 
Japan by Aflac and the Gold Ribbon 
Campaign have featured informative displays 
and videos and have also showcased the 
artwork of pediatric cancer patients. The Gold 
Ribbon Campaign originated in the United 
States to help promote childhood cancer 
awareness and raise funds for pediatric cancer 
research. This campaign has taken hold in 
Japan, where it continues to grow thanks to 
increasing support from a variety of Japanese 
organizations and companies.

ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT 
Aflac Japan remains dedicated to giving back to 
the community. Since 1993, Aflac Japan employees 
have devoted time and personal resources to 
various charitable activities. One such charity 
is the One Hundred Club, through which the 
company matches contributions of employees. 
Funds are allocated to the Parents House, Gold 
Ribbon Campaign support groups and global and 
environmental organizations.
 
Approximately 80 percent  of Aflac Japan 
employees participate and approximately $ 429,660  
(¥48 million)  was donated in 2017. 
In addition, Aflac Japan employees and agents 
selflessly give their time through various 
volunteer initiatives. For example, Aflac Japan has 
participated in blood drives since the 1995 Kobe 
earthquake, and the Aflac Sports Garden, planned 
by Aflac Japan’s CSR team, draws nearly 20,000 
attendees from local neighborhood Chofu City and 
is supported by many staff volunteers. JAPAN
Aflac’s Japan CSR team recruited their fellow colleagues to 
proudly volunteer at the Aflac Sports Garden in Chofu City.
TESTIMONIAL: 
SATORU KASUYA
Satoru Kasuya, long-distance runner 
and member of his company’s corporate 
running team, has been an Aflac cancer 
insurance policyholder since the age of 
22, when his father purchased a policy 
for him. He has often thought that the 
best part of having cancer insurance 
is not needing to use it. A glimpse 
into Kasuya-san’s life reveals personal 
dedication to fitness, endurance, 
speed and excellence. An athlete since 
the age of 13, he finds great joy from 
running. One would never know that 
only four short years ago, after feeling 
under the weather, he was diagnosed 
with malignant lymphoma – and was 
thrust into one of the most harrowing 
competitions of his life. He found it 
particularly difficult to break the news 
of his diagnosis to his family, especially 
because another family member had also 
recently been diagnosed. Fortunately, 
it wouldn’t be long before his innate 
discipline and dedication to overcoming 
obstacles would prove key to charting 
an exhaustive but successful road to recovery. Throughout his sickness, his 
Aflac policy gave him peace of mind 
and benefits that helped him focus 
on his recovery rather than concerns 
about the cost of treatment. During his 
treatment, Kasuya-san longed to get 
back to running not just for his own 
personal joy, but to get the message 
out that one can thrive post-cancer. 
With dogged determination, he set his 
sights on returning to his pre-cancer 
fitness level and beyond! He has again 
hit his stride and has high aspirations 
for the future.

GOING GREEN
Aflac Japan’s sustainability efforts are focused on reducing waste and energy 
consumption at the Aflac Square Building. Since 2011, the company has taken the 
following actions to reduce its overall carbon footprint: 
To conserve energy,  
8,800 fluorescent lamps have been replaced by LED lamps in 
the Square Building, resulting in approximately $15,000 (¥1.7 
million) in annual savings. 
To recycle waste,  
materials are sorted into 17 categories. Most importantly, 
recycled plastics can be used for power generation and 
recycled paper can be reused, earning Aflac Japan a 70 
percent recycling rate. 
To encourage green behavior,  
Aflac Japan prioritizes the purchase of business supplies 
carrying the “Eco Mark” and “Eco Leaf” logos in accordance 
with the Green Purchasing Act. This includes supplies like 
recycled paper and printer toner. Green purchasing accounts 
for more than 81 percent of office stationery supplies.A branded archway welcomes attendees to a day of fun at the Aflac 
Sports Garden.
Aflac employees approach discussions about pediatric cancer with 
sensitivity while asking for a donation for the cause.

Total weight of non-hazardous waste, with 
a breakdown by reuse and recycling.Goal 4:  Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong 
learning.
Obtaining a quality education is the foundation to improving people’s lives and 
sustainable development. Major progress has been made toward increasing 
access to education at all levels and increasing enrolment rates in schools 
particularly for women and girls. Basic literacy skills have improved tremendously, 
yet bolder efforts are needed to make even greater strides for achieving universal 
education goals. 
Goal 5:  Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.
While the world has achieved progress toward gender equality and women’s 
empowerment under the Millennium Development Goals, women and girls 
continue to suffer discrimination and violence.
Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent 
work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will 
fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large.
Goal 7:  Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for 
all.
Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world 
faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing 
incomes, access to energy for all is essential.
Sustainable energy is opportunity – it transforms lives, economies and the planet.
Goal 12:  Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
Sustainable consumption and production aims at “doing more and better with 
less,” by reducing resource use, degradation and pollution, while increasing quality 
of life. It involves different stakeholders, including businesses, consumers, policy 
makers, researchers, scientists, retailers, media, and development cooperation 
agencies, among others.
Its implementation helps to achieve overall development plans, reduce future 
economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness 
and reduce poverty.
Goal 13:  Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
People are experiencing the significant impacts of climate change, which include 
changing weather patterns, rising sea level, and more extreme weather events. 
Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is projected to rise over 
the 21st century and is likely to surpass three degrees Celsius—with some areas of 
the world expected to warm even more. 
Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog 
to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more 
people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will 
reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts.22
