2014 STATED GOALS ACCOMPLISHMENTS A LOOK AHEAD
Implement 2014 Supplier Diversity Goal: $300 million
of our total negotiable spend will be with small and
diverse suppliers.
Develop and expand lower-commitment 
transaction-based services that make it easier 
to begin outsourcing to Ryder.
Continue to expand our natural gas vehicle
offering/infrastructure.
Target new supply chain market segments like
energy, medical, and aftermarket parts.•  As of December 31, 2015, Ryder has expanded our 
 natural gas fleet to nearly 1,000 advanced fuel Natural 
 Gas (NG) vehicles.
•  Ryder now offers Renewable Natural Gas - both LNG 
 and CNG - at our California NG refueling sites.
•  Ryder has trained more than 5,000 maintenance 
 and operations personnel on NG vehicle systems and 
 maintenance, making Ryder the largest service network 
 for NG vehicle technology in all of North America.
•  Renewable Natural Gas has significant environmental 
 benefits, and, as of today, our NG vehicle fleet has 
 operated more than 90 million miles, translating into 
 more than 13 million gallons of diesel displaced.
•  Launched Healthcare & Medical Device supply chain 
 vertical industry solutions in 2015.
•  Held Customer Advisory Board meetings in new 
 market segments in order to connect Ryder industry 
 experts with logistics professionals to provide higher 
 value solutions for our customers.Throughout 2016, Ryder will continue to focus on 
reaching more customers and prospects through 
improved sales initiatives that highlight our value 
proposition. This includes enhanced sales onboarding 
and mentoring, as well as enhanced sales team training.Provide increased flexibility for our customers by 
accelerating the growth of asset-light maintenance 
solutions such as Ryder ChoiceLease Full Service, 
Ryder ChoiceLease Preventative, and Ryder 
ChoiceLease On-Demand, as well as Ryder SelectCare.
•  Deploy NG vehicles in 25 total markets over the 
 next 5 years.
•  Upgrade an additional 10 facilities to be NG 
 compliant by 2018.•  Launched Ryder SelectCare On-Demand Maintenance 
 service in 2015 that opens our national network of 
 service facilities to large fleets across the entire 
 Ryder network.•  In 2015, Ryder sourced $222M or 4.0% of total 
 negotiable spend from diverse suppliers. We are 
 shy of the plan due to increased expenses for 
 trucks, parts, and fuel, as these key items are 
 sourced from long-term suppliers which do not fall 
 into this category and constitute our largest spend.Our goal is to further expand a Small Business and 
Supplier Diversity Program in all functional business 
areas. We will continue to pursue our goal of $300 
million of our total negotiable spend to be with small 
and diverse suppliers by the end of 2017.7People

Resurvey the employee population, while also 
expanding the survey reach to include additional 
countries in which we have employees.
Develop initiatives with African-American business 
organizations to help retain and recruit a diverse 
workforce. Partners include prestigious organizations 
such as 100 Black Men and the National Society of 
Black Engineers.
•  In 2015, WLF went on the road with a series of 
 development and learning events held in 10 cities 
 in the U.S. and Canada (Alpharetta, GA; Anaheim, 
 CA; Ft. Worth, TX; Greensboro, NC; Indianapolis, IN; 
 Miami, FL; Novi, Michigan; Orlando, FL; Philadelphia, 
 PA; & Toronto, Canada). Over 300 women attended 
 these events with the goal of generating innovative 
 solutions and action plans to increase the 
 attraction, retention, and development of women 
 in field roles at Ryder. The event also provided the 
 attendees with information about leveraging 
 Ryder’s development opportunities.Expand our Women’s Leadership Forum (WLF) to 
more key Ryder locations to create networking 
and collaboration opportunities for women 
throughout Ryder.In 2016 – 2017, we are planning to conduct a Road 
Show in 10 cities in the U.S. and Canada, providing 
a hands-on and interactive development experience 
series for women in field roles. 
Additionally, our local WLF hubs will continue to host 
events throughout the year in Miami, Ft. Worth, Novi, 
and Alpharetta, as well as Canada.
In the first quarter, WLF will launch internal social 
media forums that are open to all employees, 
aimed at supporting the attraction, retention, and 
development of women, and at keeping employees 
up to date on WLF activities. Ryder will continue to leverage the African-American 
business organizations to assist with our efforts to 
attract, engage, and develop diverse talent. 
Additionally, we will continue to recognize our 
employees via external awards and speaking 
opportunities. 
In 2016, we will host a forum for African-American 
leaders to identify ways to support Ryder’s efforts to 
increase the recruitment and retention of diverse talent.100 Black Men:

2014 STATED GOALS ACCOMPLISHMENTS A LOOK AHEAD
Expand our recruiting efforts for women, which will include 
participating in the Society of Women Engineers Annual 
Conference and Career Exposition. An estimated 7,000 
engineering professionals and students are expected 
to attend this international event in Los Angeles, CA in 
October 2014.
Expand our hiring efforts to target disabled veterans 
and the spouses and caregivers of veterans. 
Implement a new applicant tracking system which will 
follow candidates as they reach various milestones in the 
hiring process, such as receiving a Commercial Drivers 
License or technical certifications.
Implement two new safety goals: 
1. Reduce vehicle collision frequency by 10% by 2016, 
 from our 2013 baseline; and 
2. Reduce employee injury frequency by 8% by 2016, 
 from a 2013 baseline.We implemented a new Applicant Tracking System in 
2014, which tracks Ryder candidates as they progress 
through the hiring process. This has resulted in a more 
efficient and effective recruiting and on-boarding process 
for incoming employees throughout the organization.
1.  Although Ryder’s 2015 vehicle collision frequency was
 .37 collisions per million miles – which is considered 
 industry-leading – Ryder did not meet its 10% DOT 
 collision frequency challenge, which targeted .26 
 collisions per million miles. The impact of the industry’s 
 driver shortage, growth in our business, and the effect of 
 a large percentage of new hire drivers was responsible 
 for an uptick in collision frequency in 2015.
2. Ryder met the challenge to reduce OSHA Recordable 
 Injury Frequency by 8% from the 2013 baseline. 
 Driving this improvement was a significant investment 
 in electrified material handling equipment, and the
 deployment of large footprint trailer lift gates that provide
 a safer work environment during the loading and unloading
 of freight, the primary cause of injuries. In addition, 
 the Company’s flatbed safety council is responsible for
 developing and sharing best practices that have significantly
 improved safety among our flatbed steel hauling operations. In 2016, we will continue to optimize our hiring process, 
including through the addition of a mobile-enabled 
employment application for drivers and technicians. 
Our goal is to make the hiring process as simple and 
efficient as possible.
We intend to improve the reduction of collision 
frequency by investing in both outward and in-cab 
video event technology, collision mitigation systems, 
and by improving the driving skills of Ryder drivers 
using the Company’s new Certified Driver Training 
Program. To date, we have seen a 37% reduction in 
risky driving behavior, and a 46% reduction in near 
collisions.
We will continue to improve screening and training 
for new hires, as well as additional pre-employment 
testing to ensure new hires can perform their jobs at 
the highest levels.Ryder’s veteran initiatives will continue with a focus on women 
veterans and transitioning service members. We will continue to 
offer our 12 week fellowship program for military officers, and 
we will continue to operate an on-base training program for 
diesel technicians. Additionally we plan to start an on-base Driver 
Development Program in the same region.  These programs are 
designed to offer graduates employment opportunities with Ryder 
once their time in the military has concluded.Veteran hiring was a major focus throughout 2014 and 2015, and 
we continue to outperform our own expectations. Ryder hired over 
2,200 veterans to date, exceeding our goal of 1,000. Additionally, we 
implemented a Veteran Buddy Program to help new veteran employees 
transition to civilian jobs, as well as a 12 week Diesel Technician training 
program with the U.S. Army at Fort Sill, OK. We also partnered with 
Hiring Our Heroes and FASTPORT, mentoring over 300 existing service 
members as they look for employment in the private sector.Ryder is building a stronger partnership with Women in 
Trucking to include board representation, participation in 
the inaugural Women in Trucking  conference in September 
2015, as well as launching marketing campaigns aimed 
at attracting more women into the industry. Ryder also 
had a nominee for the coveted “Most Influential Women in 
Trucking” award for 2015, Darcee Scavone, Ryder VP and 
GM of Automotive, Aerospace, and Industrial Operations.In 2016, we will expand our women-focused recruiting 
efforts through advertising. Additionally, we will offer 
scholarships and grants to women interested in a 
career in the trucking industry, and will sponsor and 
support organizations who promote and support 
education for women seeking technical careers, such 
as Women In Trucking.10Veteran Hiring - Employing our nation’s heroes
At Ryder, we understand the value that skilled veterans bring to our team, 
and we are committed to hiring the best that our nation has to offer. 
•  Since Ryder first initiated our veteran hiring initiative, 
 we have hired nearly 4,500 veterans, including drivers.
•  Ryder has partnered with the U.S. Chamber of   
 Commerce Hiring our Heroes program and FASTPORT  
 to mentor current military members and give them 
 an opportunity to learn about the trucking industry 
 and get more information about employment in 
 trucking and working for Ryder. Our Mentorship 
 Program with them has put us in contact with nearly 
 600 veterans and transitioning service members. 
 
•  Since joining Hiring Our Heroes in November 2011, 
 Ryder has increased the percentage of veterans in 
 its U.S. workforce from 8 percent to 10.5 percent. 
 The Company has also more than doubled the amount  
 of recently-separated veterans hired in that same 
 time period. 
•  Veteran hiring saw a 53 percent increase from 2014 
 to 2015 and comprised 10 percent of total hires. On 
 Veteran’s Day 2015, Ryder launched its Veteran Buddy
 Program, pairing current Ryder employees who are 
 military veterans with new veteran employees. Among 
 Ryder’s 2,700 veteran U.S. employee base, 400 have 
 been selected to participate in the program at various 
 Ryder locations across the country.•  In 2014, Ryder became a corporate sponsor of 
 Hiring Our Heroes’ Fellowship program, a 12-week 
 unpaid internship that provides Fellows—senior 
 non-commissioned and junior to mid-grade male and 
 female officers—with experience in the civilian 
 workforce while they transition out of the military, thus 
 giving them the opportunity to sharpen their abilities for 
 future employment. 
•  In 2014 and 2015, Ryder was named one of 
 CivilianJobs.com’s Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for 
 Military recognition. 
•  In 2014, Ryder was named one of four finalists for 
 Hiring Our Heroes’ 4th Annual Lee Anderson Veteran 
 and Military Spouse Employment Award. The award 
 honors those who have demonstrated leadership in 
 addressing the unique challenges facing our nation’s 
 military members and spouses in their search for 
 meaningful employment.
•  Ryder was named a finalist in 2015 for the 5th Annual 
 Hiring Our Heroes Don Weber Wounded Veteran and 
 Military Caregiver Employment Award, which 
 recognizes demonstrated leadership in addressing 
 the unique challenges and demands for wounded, ill, 
 and injured veterans as well as military caregivers in 
 their search for meaningful employment.2016 Ryder Corporate Sustainability Report Supplement Ryder Facts Financial Info Marketplace People  Environment Governance Community

 emissions reporting on six categories. In 2011, 
 we reported emissions associated with one Scope 
 3 category; in 2013, we reported on four 
 categories; and beginning in 2015, we started 
 reporting on six categories.
• We eliminated Scope 2 reporting gaps for Ryder 
 owned and operated facilities. Prior to 2012, 
 Scope 2 emissions were not available for some 
 areas, including U.K. operations. In 2012 and 
 2013, Scope 2 emissions were estimated for U.K., 
 and beginning in 2014, actual emissions are now 
 reported for all U.K.-based operating sites.• Perform independent 3rd party limited 
 verification/assurance review of emissions 
 accounting standards.
• Expand Scope 3 reporting categories, and 
 continue developing customer-specific 
 metrics and emissions reporting tools.

• Complete energy efficient lighting retrofits of 30 
 locations per year, reducing electricity use 20-30% 
 at those locations.
• Continue to develop new customized metrics 
 to quantify Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reductions 
 associated with transportation efficiencies.• Ryder has met or exceeded both absolute and 
 intensity-based performance targets:
  ° Ryder’s intensity performance target was 100%
   achieved in 2014. By reducing emissions per 
   unit by 20% below 2009 baseline intensity, 
   we achieved absolute emissions reductions 
   of 16,806 metric tonnes of C02e, or a 22.9% 
   overall reduction.
  ° Ryder’s absolute target goal to reduce energy 
   consumption at our FMS facilities by 20% 
   below 2009 levels by 2020 was 90% achieved 
   in 2014 and 100% achieved in 2015.
  ° See Table II (in Appendix) for year-over-year 
   improvements.
• Ryder completed 143 lighting retrofits through 2014.

Promote the Use of Alternative Fuel Vehicles
• Increase Ryder investments in Natural Gas (NG) 
 infrastructure by expanding NG fleet, as well as 
 planned NG upgrades for 30 facilities. • Increased size of natural gas rental and lease fleet 
 by nearly 100%. In 2013, Ryder operated 500 
 compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural 
 gas (LNG) vehicles. Today, Ryder NG fleet is nearly 
 1,000, with more than 70 customers in 18 states 
 and Canada, including: Arizona, Arkansas, 
 California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, 
 Michigan, New York, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, 
 and Quebec. 
• Updated 21 maintenance facilities to be NG compliant.
• Trained 5,000+ maintenance and support technicians 
 throughout North America (U.S. & Canada) to provide 
 light duty repairs and maintenance on NG vehicles.
• Launched online NG maintenance training program 
 for maintenance network at 800 facilities. Employees 
 were trained on new fuel technology and the 
 difference between servicing and fueling NG and 
 conventional diesel vehicles.
• Ryder has a combined distance of over 90 million 
 miles of natural gas vehicle experience, and has 
 replaced more than 13 million gallons of diesel fuel

• Extend our Energy Challenge program to 600 
 additional facilities in the next 5-10 years, targeting 
 57% of Ryder facilities with a goal to reduce energy 
 by 20% below 2009 levels by 2020.
• Expand recycling and reuse activities for automotive 
 waste streams, reduce volumes of waste generated, 
 and increase reuse and GHG emissions.• Energy Challenge Campaign no longer required, as 
 20% target reduction was attained. Electricity use at 
 Ryder facilities continues to decline due to 
 conservation efforts, despite business growth.
• Automotive waste recycling at all Ryder FMS shops 
 resulted in more than 2 million gallons of recycled 
 waste materials in 2014 and 2015, avoiding 20 and 
 19 MT of CO2e, respectively. See Table III Automotive

Rollout our new Principles of Business Conduct 
(POBC) in multiple languages across all employee 
groups, along with a customized online training 
module to train our employees on the POBC.
Ryder routinely engages with our shareholders on 
governance issues to ensure we understand and 
consider any specific concerns they may have. Throughout 2014, Ryder rolled out our new 
Principles of Business Conduct (POBC) to our 
global workforce. Our new POBC is focused 
on using Ryder’s values as the reason why 
our Company and our employees must be in 
compliance. Additionally, the POBC included 
customized training that provided Ryder 
employees with an overview of the POBC, as 
well as required employee certifications to ensure 
proper compliance. This training is now part of 
the on-boarding process for all new hires across 
the globe. In 2015, nearly 100% of employees 
completed the training.
At least annually, Ryder reaches out to our top 
shareholders (representing approximately 50% or 
more of our outstanding shares) to gain feedback 
on our governance and compensation profile. We 
also engage with shareholders prior to making 
any material governance changes, or when we are 
considering whether to support or enact provisions 
requested in a shareholder proposal.
In 2015, Ryder amended its charter and by-laws 
to address shareholder concerns regarding 
supermajority voting requirements.
Based on feedback received, in 2015, Ryder 
lowered its general shareholder voting 
requirements from a majority of shares outstanding 
to a majority of votes cast.
In 2015, Ryder began disclosing our political 
contributions policy and our annual direct 
corporate contributions to political candidates on 
our website.•

•Ryder is adding new modules to our POBC training, 
and we are aiming for 100% of employees to 
complete the training in 2016, including annual live 
training for senior management on our compliance 
and ethics culture.
Ryder is planning to implement a company-wide 
policy management and control system that 
will ensure periodic reviews, attestations, and 
easy access to all employees for all policies and 
procedures.
In 2016, we are adopting a proxy access provision 
in our by-laws, which will permit shareholders to 
nominate directors using Ryder’s proxy materials. 
Based on feedback we received from our 
shareholders, we tailored the provision to require 
the following: 
 -  Shareholders must own 3% of Ryder’s stock
   for at least 3 years in order to nominate up to 
  20% of our Board, or 2 directors, whichever 
  is greater.
 -  Up to 25 shareholders may group together to  
         reach the 3% ownership requirement.
Ryder is in the process of declassifying the Board, 
and will start annual director elections in 2016. 
Additionally, we plan to lower the maximum number 
of other public Company boards that outside 
directors can sit on to four in our Corporate 
Governance Guidelines.18Communit y

Commit to a 2014 corporate pledge of $335,000 to the
United Way, matching a record pledge of $255,000 by
Ryder South Florida employees in 2013 — for a total of
$590,000 in support.
Expand Ryder’s United Way campaign beyond
South Florida to include coordinated employee giving
campaigns at Ryder “hub” locations in greater Atlanta,
Dallas/Ft. Worth, and Detroit.
Benchmark other corporate giving programs to
consider modifications to further align and enhance
Ryder’s giving strategy in 2014 and 2015.Ryder successfully expanded the campaign to our 
three largest locations outside of headquarters: 
Ryder’s Shared Services Center in Alpharetta, GA; 
Transportation Management Center in Ft. Worth, TX.; 
and Novi Michigan offices. In addition, we expanded the 
campaign to all of Ryder’s U.S. rental organization.
As a result of our benchmarking initiative, strategic 
giving pillars were established in 2014 to further 
align charitable efforts with Ryder’s brand and core 
values. The pillars are Expertise, Innovation, Safety, 
and Collaboration. An example of a project that was 
developed using the new model to align with Ryder’s 
core value of “Innovation” was the University of 
Miami Capstone Project, funding graduate student 
engineering teams to research real business issues 
using actual data provided by Ryder.
In 2015, Ryder continued to expand its giving within 
the four pillars, including grants to vocational-tech 
institutions to help educate the next generation of 
diesel technicians and commercial drivers, and to 
attract more women and military veterans into the 
transportation industry.In 2014, Ryder’s campaign for the United Way raised  
$703,000 (employees $358,000/Company $345,000). 
The campaign surpassed our 2014 goal of $641,000, 
and achieved a 12% increase from 2013.

to vocational institutions (Expertise), funding 
university research about emerging technologies 
to drive efficiencies in logistics (Innovation), 
forming a strategic partnership with a world-
class healthcare institution to address critical 
community care needs (Collaboration), and 
supporting efforts to stop human trafficking and 
help victims assimilate as healthy and productive 
members of society (Safety).2016 Ryder Corporate Sustainability Report Supplement Ryder Facts Financial Info Marketplace People Environment Governance Community
