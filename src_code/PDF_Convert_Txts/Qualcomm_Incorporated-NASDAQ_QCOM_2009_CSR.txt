Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report
Our Company Commitment to Our Workplace, Our Community and Our EnvironmentMESSAGE FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
As we celebrate our 25th anniversary, the people at Qualcomm can take 
pride in knowing their creative ideas have changed the lives of people 
everywhere. Through innovative thinking and a determination to make 
a difference, we have grown from a handful of people in San Diego to a 
global organization of more than 16,000 diverse individuals in over
30 countries. As we reflect back on our journey, it is fitting that we 
celebrate not just our achievements, but the principles that have guided
us along the way and now serve as the foundation of our corporate
social responsibility platform.
Our Mission Is Global And So Is Our Responsibility
Today, Qualcomm is focused on leading the wireless revolution and 
creating mobile technologies that positively transform life for people all 
around the world. The impact we have not just on the mobile industry but 
our global community is significant—and carries with it great responsibility. 
That’s why throughout our heritage, we have endeavored to build a 
company that conducts business in a responsible and ethical manner, 
while enabling a culture that embraces diversity, respects the environment 
and supports the communities in which we work and live.
Responsibility In Action
Year after year we put our commitment toward these principles into 
action through a deliberate focus on our business, our workplace, our 
communities and the environment. In fact, we’ve made over $150 million 
in donations over the past ten years through our corporate giving and 
matching grants programs, and every member of our executive team is 
active in the community. Our investments in energy efficiency yield nearly 
$3 million in savings annually and our conservation efforts result in
17.8 million gallons of water saved each year. And with nearly 1,800
work/life balance programs, services and events available to our 
employees, along with close to 50,000 enrollments in training courses 
each year, we strive to create a supportive workplace for our employees. 
These are just a few of the highlights that demonstrate our commitment
to making a difference as an employer and global citizen. 
To find out more about Qualcomm’s social responsibility story I invite
you to review this year’s report. I believe it reflects the strength 
of character of our people and our ongoing belief in our founding 
principles. Most importantly, you’ll see firsthand our dedication to 
supporting our employees and working together to make a difference 
in our global community. On behalf of all of us here at Qualcomm, I’m 
pleased to reaffirm our commitment to continuing that tradition over
the next 25 years.
 
—Dr. Paul E. Jacobs

Qualcomm’s Leadership & Organizational Structure
I   2009 Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report10Corporate Governance & Ethics  
Qualcomm’s Board of Directors provides sound corporate 
governance and sets high standards for our employees, officers 
and directors. It is the duty of the Board of Directors to serve 
as a prudent fiduciary for our stockholders and to oversee the 
Company’s management. The Board of Directors periodically 
evaluates the size and structure of the Board. The Board has four 
committees consisting of Audit, Compensation, Governance and 
Finance. With the exception of the Finance Committee, members 
of all committees are “independent” under applicable guidelines. 
The Board considers its committee structure to be appropriate, 
but the number and scope of committees may be revised as 
needed to meet changing conditions and needs.
Qualcomm is committed to abiding by all applicable laws and 
regulations regarding political contributions throughout the world. 
At the Federal level, Qualcomm does not make in-kind 
contributions to federal candidates or political committees.  
Federal contributions are made by the Qualcomm Political Action 
Committee (QPAC). Information regarding contributions by QPAC 
is publicly reported and available on the website of the Federal 
Election Commission. At the State level, Qualcomm has made 
contributions to candidates, ballot initiatives and political parties.  
At the local level, Qualcomm has made contributions to local 
parties and ballot initiatives.
Qualcomm also adheres to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA), a U.S. law that prohibits the providing of improper 
gifts to foreign officials.  In addition, Qualcomm adheres to the 
Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA), a U.S. 
law prohibiting any registered lobbyist, or any organization that 
employs a lobbyist (such as Qualcomm), from providing certain 
gifts to Congressional employees. HLOGA requires companies that 
employ lobbyists to certify semiannually that they have read the 
gift rules, and that no gifts that were known to be in violation of 
the Congressional gift rules have been given.
Employees may participate in political activities of their choice 
on an individual basis, with their own money and on their own 
personal time, subject to all applicable laws and company policies.
Corporate Governance Highlights
• Qualcomm generally files our 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings
 concurrently with our earnings release.
• We do not maintain a defined benefit pension plan.
• Our 401(k) employee retirement plan does not have direct 
 ownership in Qualcomm stock.
Executive Roles
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are one 
function. The Board elects the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer in the manner, and based on the criteria, that it deems 
appropriate and in the best interests of the Company given the 
circumstances at the time of such election.
Board of Directors
The Company has 10 out of 12 independent directors. The 
independent directors are not employees (or employees within 
the last three years) and do not have any business or consulting 
arrangements with the Company. We have a Presiding Director 
who is an independent director. The Presiding Director also serves 
as the chairperson of one of the three standing committees of the 
Board of Directors comprised solely of independent directors—
Audit, Compensation and Governance. The Presiding Director 
presides at all meetings of the Board of Directors at which 
the Chairman of the Board is not present, including Executive 
Sessions of the independent directors. 2009 Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report   I   11
Code of Ethics
Qualcomm’s Code of Ethics was created to ensure the 
preservation of our high standards for workplace integrity, 
conduct and ethics. Theft, fraud and other dishonest or unethical 
behaviors are not tolerated. Qualcomm relies on our employees to 
report unethical behavior and encourages them to seek assistance 
and direction on any workplace concerns from their manager, 
Human Resources, the Legal Department or any other appropriate 
person in the Company. 
Code of Ethics Awareness Campaign
As part of a continuing education campaign, our CEO sends out 
twice a year a company-wide email restating the responsibility 
of all employees to uphold our ethics standards and encouraging 
employees to take our online ethics training.
Code of Ethics Hotline
If employees do not feel comfortable coming forward with a 
concern, we have established the Code of Ethics Hotline, which 
allows employees to make anonymous reports.
Open Door Policy
Our open door policy provides support to employees and a 
process for raising concerns, complaints and suggestions to 
management. Open communication is encouraged and expected 
among all levels of our staff.
Protection Against Retaliation
In order to encourage an environment of open, honest 
communication, Qualcomm does not tolerate any retaliation for 
reporting a concern or initiating or assisting in any action resulting 
in an investigation. Discipline for violating this policy includes 
potential termination.
For the most recent information regarding Qualcomm Governance 
and Ethics and our complete documents for our Code of Ethics, 
Governance Principles and Practices and Board committee 
charters, please visit our Investor Relations website
http:/ /investor.qualcomm.com/governance.cfmStockholder Communications
We have adopted a formal process for stockholder 
communications with the Board. Stockholders who wish 
to communicate to the Board may do so in writing to the 
Company’s General Counsel. Our General Counsel logs all such 
communications and forwards those not deemed frivolous, 
threatening or otherwise inappropriate to the Chair of the 
Governance Committee for distribution.
In accordance with the procedures in the Company’s Bylaws, 
stockholders may also submit proposals for consideration at the 
Company’s annual stockholders’ meeting.
Corporate Ethics
Qualcomm was founded with a commitment to the highest 
standards of integrity, workplace conduct and business ethics, and 
we are proud to operate under those principles today. In the spirit 
of this commitment, we have succeeded in creating a productive 
and positive environment where employees can freely share their 
ideas, opinions and concerns.
One hundred percent of our business units are evaluated for 
risks related to corruption. There has never been any legal case 
for corruption brought against our employees or us. Qualcomm 
achieves this by regularly training one hundred percent of 
employees who are deemed relevant to anti-corruption concerns 
on applicable policies and procedures such as our Code of 
Business Conduct, Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements and U.S. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Our Company
Qualcomm’s Leadership & Organizational Structure
I   2009 Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report12Customer Privacy Protection
Qualcomm is committed to protecting personal information 
and privacy of the consumers who benefit from our innovations 
in wireless technology and services. Respect for privacy helps 
Qualcomm build and maintain the trust of our business partners 
and customers, protects our brand and reputation, provides 
business advantages by distinguishing our products and services 
and helps ensure legal compliance. Qualcomm has not received 
any complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy or data 
in 2009 or the prior two years. We established a cross-divisional 
privacy steering committee to help guide the activities of the 
Company that impact privacy.It is the policy of Qualcomm, our subsidiaries and 
divisions, to comply with anti-corruption laws, 
including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA), other applicable U.S. laws and the
anti-corruption laws and regulations of the 
countries where we do business. It is the 
Company’s policy to obey laws, including those 
laws that regulate our conduct in the marketing 
of our products, services and technologies in the 
international marketplace. 
All employees, agents, consultants and 
representatives, wherever they are located, who 
are deemed relevant to anti-corruption concerns 
and FCPA-type risks are expected to review, 
understand and follow Qualcomm’s FCPA Policy 
in their daily activities. These individuals annually 
certify that they understand this Policy and are 
aware of no violations of the Policy.  
In the most recent certification process, we 
identified active employees who might implicate 
Qualcomm to FCPA-type risks (46 percent of our 
workforce) and 99.9 percent of those employees 
certified the Policy.Qualcomm’s Foreign

Qualcomm’s Leadership & Organizational Structure
I   2009 Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report14Product Responsibility
Qualcomm continuously monitors the processes and materials that 
go into our products in order to find opportunities to improve them 
and make them as sustainable as technically and commercially 
possible. Through our environmental management system (EMS) 
and various hazardous substance elimination programs, we address 
the environmental, health and safety impacts of all our products. 
One hundred percent of our products are subject to our EMS and 
various Qualcomm environmental requirements.
Environmentally &  
Socially Conscientious Chip Design
Qualcomm’s commitment to responsible product design has a 
long history. We began exploring elimination of lead from our 
integrated circuit (IC) products in 1999—long before the European 
Union’s Restriction on Hazardous Substance (RoHS) Directive 
came into force in July 2006. In 2003, we became one of the 
leading IC manufacturers that successfully introduced the
lead-free chip level package (CSP) products.
In 2003, we began prohibiting the use of various hazardous 
substances (22 substances as of 2009) in our IC product 
designs. Although legislation does not require elimination of all 
halogenated flame retardants and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
from our products, Qualcomm has been proactive in eliminating 
these substances. 
We began our bromine/chlorine elimination program in 2003, 
starting with incorporation of bromine-free mold compounds. All 
new IC products designed beginning January 2009 incorporate 
the bromine/chlorine-free package design strategy. 
Our bromine/chlorine-free design will also extend to our non-IC 
products, including embedded Gobi, 3G module for notebooks 
and netbooks designed to untether users from Wi-Fi hotspots. 
New Gobi designs introduced from January 2010 will be 
bromine/chlorine-free.As a fabless manufacturer of IC products, Qualcomm’s 
partnership with our manufacturing suppliers plays an integral 
role in our commitment to providing environmentally and socially 
conscientious products. In addition to requiring that each IC 
manufacturing supplier has an ISO14001 certified environmental 
management system, Qualcomm CDMA Chip Technologies (QCT) 
works with each IC manufacturing supplier in all stages of design to 
ensure compliance with applicable global environmental legislation 
and various industry and Qualcomm environmental initiatives.
Qualcomm is concerned about the social and environmental 
conditions associated with the electronics industry supply chain, 
including mining activities in regions of conflict. It is Qualcomm’s 
intent not to contribute to financing of armed conflict, human 
rights violations and environmental degradations in such regions. 
Qualcomm recognizes the importance of cooperation and 
commitment from the supply base and, thus, is working with 
suppliers to ensure greater transparency of certain metals present 
in our products, in particular those metals which are known to 
come from regions of conflict.
2009 Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report    I   15Qualcomm has been proactive at eliminating halogenated flame 
retardants and polyvinyl chloride from our products.
Enabling Energy Efficiency
of Wireless Consumer Electronics
Qualcomm’s efforts to design environmentally sustainable 
products also extend to the groundbreaking SnapdragonTM 
platform, targeted for mobile wireless computing devices. 
Our Snapdragon chipsets are industry-leading in their power 
consumption optimizations. Snapdragon chipsets make wireless 
devices more environmentally sound by enabling the battery to 
last longer, increasing the amount of time the device can be in use 
before needing recharging.Exemplary Environmental Governance
All of our IC, Gobi and new European fleet management 
products are in compliance with the EU RoHS Directive and 
perfluorootanoic acid/perfluorootanoic sulfonate (PFOA/PFOS) 
Directive. No EU REACH Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) 
is used in the manufacture of our IC products, Gobi or commercial 
vehicle telematics products. Additionally, QES products 
manufactured and shipped for the European market are Waste 
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive compliant.
QCT products fully comply with Phase 1 of China’s Management 
Methods on control of Pollution from Electronic Information 
Products (also known as China RoHS). Qualcomm chipsets will 
comply with the material restriction requirements that apply to 
the draft Catalogue listed products.
Additionally, Qualcomm had no significant fines for non-compliance 
with laws and regulations concerning the provision and use of 
products and services.

product design, please visit our website at www.qctconnect.com  
Qualcomm has a robust packaging material control program 
that is applicable to all Qualcomm IC business operations and 
the entire supply base. All Qualcomm IC business operations and 
the supply base are required to use packaging materials that are 
on the approved packaging materials list. The listed materials 
meet Qualcomm’s packaging program objectives which include 
addressing environment, health and safety legislation requirements 
and concerns. The program resulted in elimination of formaldehyde 
from pallets used by Qualcomm IC operations and the supply 
base. All pallets used today are made from 100 percent recyclable 
material, either corrugated cardboard and/or compressed wood 
chips. We were able to successfully convince over 65 percent of our 
IC customers to accept loose carton shipments that require much 
less packaging materials.
Furthermore, Qualcomm continues to look for opportunities to 
reduce and eliminate unnecessary packaging materials. Through 
calculating and tracking the amount of packaging material 
used per shipment over the last three years, Qualcomm has 
implemented a new packaging inner box which is 40 percent 
less in volume and has a reduced material density which has 
eliminated the use of bubble wraps within the inner box. As a 
result, Qualcomm is able to pack more product within the same 
outer cartons thereby consolidating shipments and reducing the 
size of the carbon footprint caused by our products.mirasol Technologies
Qualcomm’s mirasol 
displays are a technology 
breakthrough that deliver 
substantial performance 
benefits. The reflective 
displays, based on 
interferometric modulation 
technology, offer a 
significant reduction in 
power consumption as compared 
to other display technologies, 
while extending device battery 
life, enabling new features and reducing environmental 
impact. Moreover, these displays require no supplemental 
lighting in most ambient lighting environments and can be 
viewed in bright sunlight. Improving energy efficiency is 
an essential first step in creating greener mobile devices. 
Pike Research’s analysis indicates that reflective display 
technologies such as interferometric modulator displays 
(IMOD) provide a significant energy efficiency advantage 
over incumbent technologies such as LCD or OLED. In Pike’s 
analysis, a mobile device using an IMOD display would 
consume 33.7 percent less energy, which extends the battery 
life by 51 percent, when compared with a similar mobile device 
that uses a conventional LCD display. Based on a simple 
lifecycle analysis, this would result in 94 percent less carbon 
dioxide emitted in the use phase for the display. In addition, 
this efficiency advantage results in about 58 fewer recharge 
cycles over the course of a year and would extend the life of 
the battery for an additional 1.25 years.

There is also increasing scrutiny on substances used within 
electronic devices and heightened restrictions on their 
usage, with bromine-based flame retardants one key focus 
for mobile devices.
“Brominated flame retardants have played an important 
role in ensuring that electric equipment does not ignite 
while being used by a consumer, but there has been 
considerable pressure to remove bromine and chlorine 
from our chipsets,”  Lee said. “We need to be green, and 
that means removing brominated flame-retardants. Our 
engineering team has been working diligently to ensure 
our chips contain no or little environmentally adverse 
substances.”
As of January 2009, Qualcomm started designing all of its 
products without bromine and chlorine, and has committed 
to introducing a bromine- and chlorine-free Gobi module by 
January 2010.Being socially responsible isn’t only good for the 
environment, it’s good for business. The “greening” of the 
mobile phone was a major theme at the 2009 Mobile World 
Congress in Barcelona, with more efficient and renewable 
power sources dominating the environmental agenda.
For many wireless manufacturers “going green” has taken 
incentives from the marketplace, but for Qualcomm, it has 
always been a core corporate value. We’ve been working 
towards a more “green” mobile device since the 1990’s—long 
before sustainability was fashionable.
It’s this innovative attitude that has kept us ahead of the 
curve. When the Mobile World Congress focused on power 
saving solutions, Qualcomm already had an answer. For 
Qualcomm, the development of enhanced chipsets, such as 
Snapdragon, is playing a considerable role in reducing the 
power demands placed on mobile devices.
“Snapdragon chips allow low-power consumption on 
mobile devices and electronic equipment, ” said Michelle 
Lee, Staff Engineer for environmental management systems 
at Qualcomm CDMA Technologies. “From a sustainability 
perspective, Snapdragon is making devices more 
environmentally sound by enabling the battery to last longer, 
thereby increasing the amount of time that the device can 
be used before requiring a recharge.”
What’s more, Snapdragon, like all of Qualcomm’s integrated 
circuit and module products, is RoHS (Restrictions on 
Hazardous Substances) compliant. It meets the European 
Parliament and Council of the European Union requirements, 
enabling extensive roll out of Snapdragon-based devices 
across the continent. 
2009 Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report   I   17Supplier Diversity
Diversity is a strong component of Qualcomm’s unique culture. 
In accordance with this, the Small Business Administration’s 
subcontract reporting requirements to the government and 
reporting requirements to our commercial customers, Qualcomm 
established the Supplier Diversity Program. The program 
ensures that we maintain our commitment and obligations to all 
classifications of small and diverse business suppliers.
The Supplier Diversity Program procedures are in full compliance 
with public laws, and both the Federal and Defense Acquisition 
Regulations as imposed upon us by the United States government. 
Since implementing the Supplier Diversity Program at the end of 
2006, Qualcomm continually strives to increase the amount we 
spend with small and diverse businesses.
Improved Supplier Database Resources
Qualcomm has an online registration where small and diverse 
suppliers can register their company profiles. This database may 
be used by all internal employees when seeking new suppliers.
Our Supplier Diversity Program ensures 
that we maintain our commitment  
and obligations to small and diverse 
business suppliers.Supplier Diversity Program Policy
Qualcomm’s company-wide Supplier Diversity Program policy 
has been established to promote participation of United States 
small and diverse business concerns when sourcing suppliers 
to fulfill subcontracting requirements. Recognizing the value 
of supplier diversity, it is our intent to place a fair proportion of 
our total purchases of goods and services with all classification 
types of diverse business concerns. These include small, 
minority, disadvantaged, woman-owned, veteran-owned and 
disabled-owned businesses situated in a HUBZone and all
other related socio-economic subsets.
Our Supplier Diversity Program has been established in 
accordance with these guidelines:
• In the acquisition of supplies and services, a good faith effort 
 shall be made to encourage participation by such small and 
 diverse business concerns.
• In dealing with established and potential suppliers, small 
 and diverse business concerns shall be afforded an equitable 
 opportunity to compete for contracts that are within their 
 capabilities to perform.
• Guidelines established under our negotiated contracts, 
 including our Corporate Procurement Policies and
 Procedures, ensure full compliance with public laws that 
 relate to all classification types of small and diverse
 business concerns.
New Training Outreach Efforts
During 2009, Qualcomm’s Supplier Diversity Program offered 
a unique value-add to many business units by providing 
comprehensive in-house training with presentations including 
aspects from both the Company’s and the diverse supplier’s 
perspective. Numerous outreach efforts are incorporated to 
increase management and company-wide awareness about the 
benefits of utilizing diverse suppliers.
Program managers and procurement personnel receive 
personalized assistance from having business classifications 
added to their preferred supplier bid lists, thus resulting in 
recommended diverse supplier selections qualified to fulfill 
subcontracting requirements.Number of Div erse Suppliers Regis tered

Learning Center
Qualcomm offers two mandatory training programs: Sexual 
Harassment for managers and Secure Code for software 
developers. The company offers the following annual per person 
hours of training.Education & Training
Qualcomm continues our best-in-class approach to learning. 
Our Learning Center’s new initiatives focused on identifying 
and nurturing our future leaders as well as expanding project 
management best practices. The Company’s library, which is part
of the Learning Center, continued to expand its research and 
database capabilities to provide the latest in-depth engineering, 
business and marketing reports and analysis to our employees.
Emerging Leader Program
For years, Qualcomm has provided management at all levels with 
thorough management and leadership training. In response to 
senior management’s request to identify and grow future leaders, 
the Learning Center created an innovative blended learning 
program called the Emerging Leader Program. This invitation-
only program was designed specifically for Qualcomm’s individual 
contributors who have the potential and desire to be future 
leaders of Qualcomm. Over a 12-week span, participants take part 
in a combination of instructor-led virtual, classroom and team 
learning sessions. The program includes a 180-degree assessment 
of the participant to help him/her assess those skills that are 
critical for their success in a future leadership role.
Project Management
Good project management can make or break a budget and 
product timelines. It can mean the difference between being the 
market leader or losing your competitive edge. To find project 
management best practices, the Learning Center decided that 
some of the best role models were to be found within our own 
company. As a result, a new project management web site was 
developed where new and current project managers can read 
and watch interviews of their peers who describe their best 
practices. The interviews put their best practices into the context 
of real work situations, making it easier for learners to make the 
connection to their own situations. The web site also includes links 
to updated articles on project management that enhances the 
overall program.
48,400 enrollments
Qualcomm recorded over 48,400 enrollments in 
classroom training courses.2009 Training Highlights

Enterprise 2.0 Series
Social media programs have not only become a primary means 
for communicating among friends, they are also becoming an 
increasingly important channel for internal collaboration and 
reaching out to a company’s partners and customers. To keep 
Qualcomm’s employees ahead of the curve on social media, the 
Learning Center’s Learning Technology team created a series of 
popular lectures that brought to Qualcomm some of the field’s 
most influential experts on this topic. They also worked closely 
with Qualcomm’s IT department to help implement an internal 
social media channel which allows employees to communicate 
globally with other employees in a more open and dynamic way.

Women’s Initiatives
Qualcomm developed a Women’s Mentoring Program to
promote professional development of female employees to build 
their professional skills and networks.
 • 100 percent of mentees stated that mentorship created
  problem solving opportunities.
 • 91 percent of mentees stated that they benefitted from
  the program.
 • 91 percent of mentees recommended mentorship to others.
 • 90 percent of mentors and mentees committed to continue
  their relationship beyond the formal program.
Qualcomm has partnered with National Center for Women 
and Information Technology (NCWIT) on initiatives to increase 
women’s participation in technology along the entire pipeline, 
from K-12 through industry. We are creating opportunities and 
providing tools for female employees because we believe gender 
diversity means a larger and more competitive workforce. We 
are demonstrably committed to advancing women. Qualcomm’s 
Board of Directors is comprised of 23 percent women. In 2009, 
Catalyst figured women constituted only 14 percent of Fortune 
500 company board seats, and 40 percent of Fortune 500 
companies have no women on their boards. We are proud to have 
many women leaders within our senior executive ranks. In 2009, 
there were over 100 women promoted and 20 hired into Director 
or above roles.
Disability Initiatives
2009 marked the 6th year Qualcomm was one of the presenting 
sponsors for the San Diego Jobtoberfest Job Fair for people 
with disabilities. We have also been actively involved on the job 
fair planning committee as a member of the San Diego Committee 
on the Employment of People with Disabilities. Additionally, 
we have included disability service providers in our on-site 
employee resource fair to integrate disability awareness into 
our corporate culture.
Qualcomm has been involved in the U.S. Business Leadership 
Network (USBLN) by having an employee serve on their Board 
of Directors and sponsoring their 2009 Conference. The USBLN 
recognizes and promotes best practices in hiring, retaining 
and marketing to people with disabilities. The USBLN uses a 
“business to business” approach to educate about the imperative 
of including people with disabilities in the workforce. As a lead 
employer for the San Diego BLN Chapter, Qualcomm hosted an 
employer forum with the former U.S. Assistant Secretary of the 
Office of Disability Employment policy to raise awareness to other 
employers in the San Diego region regarding the business case
for employing people with disabilities.Global Workforce Inclusion 
Our innovative workforce consists of people with a unique blend 
of talents, backgrounds and experiences all working together to 
create some of the best technology in the world. Through our 
Global Workforce Inclusion initiatives we provide a wide variety
of opportunities for all employees.
Veterans’ Initiatives
Qualcomm takes many proactive steps to attract qualified 
veterans through job placement associations. 
To advance, educate and prepare transitioning veterans for 
the job market, Qualcomm recruiters and human resource 
representatives have worked with the State of California’s 
Employment Development Department (EDD), Veterans Affairs 
(VA) and Transition Assistance Program (TAP). Our Company has 
participated in a number of outreach events this year including:
• Employers Panel presented by the EDD and TAP.  This panel
 helped over 100 transitioning military veterans gain insight to
 job opportunities at Qualcomm, learn how to successfully
 present themselves for consideration and build confidence in 
 their transferable skills and experiences. 
• Presented to the San Diego VA office staff.
 This event trained the VA staff on ways to help veterans
 seek and prepare for jobs at Qualcomm and other 
 Fortune 500 companies.

National Consortium for Graduate Degrees in Engineering
and Science (GEM)
Qualcomm is a proud member of the National GEM Consortium. 
This collaboration between industry and university seeks to address 
the critical shortfall in production of engineering and scientific 
talent by providing graduate fellowships in engineering and science 
to highly qualified individuals from underrepresented engineering 
populations. In 2009, Qualcomm supported fellowships to three 
students providing them with the funding to seek an advanced 
degree coupled with an engineering internship with the Company.
Qualcomm Career Experience
Since 1994, the Qualcomm Career Experience has exposed 
minority high school students to high tech careers and the paths 
needed to achieve them. The experience provides students with 
an overview of life at Qualcomm and exposure to the types of 
opportunities a career in the high tech industry can provide. 
The experience typically includes a corporate overview, a panel 
discussion with six to eight Qualcomm employees, group  
breakout sessions with individual employees and a tour of 
our facilities. 
Our participation is focused on high schools with the most diverse 
populations. At the heart of the Career Experience is the panel 
discussion. Volunteer employees range from high-level executives 
to recent college graduates, and we strive to recruit a volunteer 
panel that accurately reflects our highly diverse employee 
population. Employees from a variety of backgrounds share 
insight on their careers, including job description, career paths, 
educational background and lessons learned. Students break out 
into focus groups with individual employees to learn more about 
careers of particular interest.
Targeted Recruiting on University Campuses
Through our participation at minority and female-centered career 
fairs, we observed that a large percentage of visitors were college 
students. In efforts to reach this diverse student population, 
we increased our interaction and sponsorships with on-campus 
diversity engineering chapters of the National Society of Black 
Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers and the Society of 
Hispanic Professional Engineers at key universities.

employees of all levels on nonprofit Boards of Directors and 
Advisory Committees. Through board/committee service, 
Qualcomm executives and employees bring a breadth of 
experience and knowledge that not only expands a nonprofit’s 
ability to achieve its mission, but also builds their capacity to create 
a sustainable, financially-sound organization. Simultaneously, 
employees develop and hone new business skills while giving back 
to our communities. 
QCares actively solicits board and committee service needs from 
nonprofit organizations which are posted to our internal database 
of available opportunities. Employees search to identify an 
opportunity that best fits their interests and skill set. Additionally,

To develop young arts enthusiasts and cultivate future museum 
members and supporters, Qualcomm was instrumental in the 
development of the Free Under 25 program at the Museum. 
The Company’s lead sponsorship of this new initiative provides 
free admission to all visitors ages 25 and under. It has been 
very successful, with over 35,000 young people enjoying free 
admission since 2007 and a 124 percent increase in attendance by 
18- to 25-year olds since its inception.
“We recognize that young adults often have limited disposable 
income, and through Qualcomm’s leadership and generosity, we 
are able to eliminate any challenges this group may have with 
admission. The program has been a tremendous success and 
would not have been possible without Qualcomm’s commitment 
to corporate philanthropy,” says Dr. Hugh Davies, The David C. 
Copley Director of MCASD.Culturally Vibrant Communities 
Israel: Tirat Carmel Conservatory 
Qualcomm has supported the Tirat Carmel Conservatory for the

China: Lizhi Rehabilitation Kindergarten
Lizhi Rehabilitation Kindergarten is a new school that provides 
services to mentally disabled children ages 0-7 in Beijing, China. 
Qualcomm’s charitable contribution purchased essential items
for establishing the new school such as furniture, musical 
instruments, books, outdoor toys, hygiene equipment and 
computer equipment. In February 2009, over forty employees 
from our Beijing offices volunteered their time to paint and 
decorate the kindergarten. 
United Kingdom: Prince’s Trust 
The Prince’s Trust’s Business Program, which offers young 
entrepreneurs loan funding, advice and the support of a business 
mentor, has helped over 70,000 disadvantaged young people to 
set up in business. In 2009, Qualcomm helped implement changes 
to the model which will now offer support to more young people 
by helping them choose the next appropriate step which is best 
for them, rather than assuming they are ready to start a business.  
The Trust will help those ready to start a business to plan and 
test their ideas more thoroughly, improving the quality of their 
business propositions and therefore increasing their chances of 
success. Qualcomm is also an active supporter of The Prince’s 
Trust’s Technology Leadership Group which brings together 
leaders from the technology industry to share best practices, 
network and engage with this cause. Staff from each Qualcomm 
UK office have volunteered as ‘Charity Champions’ to help 
promote the partnership and to encourage others to get involved. United States: Promoting Math and Science Education
for Young People
Qualcomm is committed to improving science, technology, 
engineering and math education for students during their 
primary, secondary and higher education years, and to expanding 
educational opportunities for under-represented students.  
Research shows that a declining number of American students are 
pursuing college degrees in technological fields, and that there is 
a critical misalignment between K-12 science and math education 
programs and the knowledge and skills needed to perform jobs 
in the high tech industry. Qualcomm addresses this problem by 
focusing on community involvement opportunities that support 
our commitment to cultivating a qualified workforce, such as:
Encorps Teachers Program
Qualcomm is proud to support the Encorps Teachers Program,
a nonprofit organization that was developed with guidance from
the California Governor’s Committee on Educational Excellence.
Encorps recruits retiring math, science and technology 
professionals to teach at California’s under-resourced public 
high schools. Recently released national test scores place 
California near the bottom in science and math education. 
In light of these scores and consistent research demonstrating 
teacher quality as the most important factor in student 
achievement, radical new thinking is needed to improve math 
and science teaching. EnCorps tackles this crisis in California 
public education, by tapping the knowledge of experienced 
math and science professionals to teach a new generation. 
In 2009, EnCorps attracted over 1,100 applicants and recruited 
over 100 math and science professionals. 
EnCorps addresses educational disparities by attracting 
individuals with a dramatically different perspective of math  
and science connections in the real world: professionals with 
math and science expertise. EnCorps believes mathematicians, 
scientists, engineers and technology experts with years of 
applied knowledge have unique abilities to show children how 
their fields work and inspire them to pursue similar careers. 
With the help of EnCorps, professionals can become teachers in 
as little as a year. EnCorps also provides assistance, support and 
mentoring to these new teachers for the first two years of their 
teaching careers.

Qualcomm Institute for Innovation and Educational Success
We established the Qualcomm Institute for Innovation and 
Educational Success at San Diego State University (SDSU) with 
a contribution of $14.5 million in 2004 and have continuously 
supported its four main programs, including: 
• Project Lead The Way (PLTW)
 Operated by SDSU’s College of Engineering, this program trains
 middle and high school teachers to implement problem-based,
 pre-engineering coursework into their classes. PLTW is a 
 national nonprofit organization that has developed a sequence 
 of courses that emphasizes hands-on, rigorous and relevant 
 experiences in Science, Technology, Engineering and 
 Mathematics (STEM) and biomedical sciences in an effort to 
 prepare students for academic and professional success in these
 disciplines. PLTW aims to encourage an increasingly diverse 
 group of students to consider careers as scientists, technology 
 experts, engineers, mathematicians, healthcare providers 
 and researchers. Students who move through PLTW curriculum 
 are well-prepared for college engineering programs and more 
 likely to be successful in pursuing engineering as a career.
 The PLTW program has been endorsed by the National 
 Academies of Engineering and Science as the exemplary 
 program for K-12 curriculum modeled on world-class standards. 
 PLTW will serve over 12,000 students in 160 California schools 
 in the upcoming year. 
• Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics (ISAM) 
 Administered by SDSU’s College of Education, ISAM improves
 students’ mathematics understanding and achievement by 
 enhancing teachers’ content knowledge of mathematics and 
 mathematics teaching effectiveness in grades K-12. Since 
 2000, ISAM has served 2,370 teachers and 208,930 students 
 throughout San Diego County. Over 400 teachers have earned a 
 math specialist certificate. The results have been amazing— 
 record numbers of students are now passing state mathematics 
 exit exams and enrollment in mathematics courses is soaring. University of California at San Diego’s 
COSMOS Program 
For the past five years, Qualcomm has supported COSMOS—
a month-long residential program at University of California at 
San Diego for California high school students who have a 
demonstrated interest and achievement in math and science. 
COSMOS provides students with the opportunity to participate 
in an intensive academic experience delivered by distinguished 
educators and scholars. Qualcomm hires COSMOS alumni as 
summer interns to further grow their education and interest 
in STEM fields. In addition, Qualcomm employees speak at 
COSMOS events to encourage students to continue their 
education and interest in these critically important subjects.

India: vBay, Real-Time Mobile Classifieds for Agri-Entrepreneurs
India’s population is roughly 1.15 billion people and more than half 
of the work force is in agriculture.1 According to the Indian Society 
of Agribusiness Professionals (ISAP), most of the agriculture 
population lives in rural areas with minimal access to market 
information. To help support the agriculture industry and reach 
the rural population, Wireless Reach engaged in a pilot project 
with ISAP and United Villages Networks to develop vBay, a BREW-
enabled mobile classifieds application for rural agri-entrepreneurs 
to be deployed in the villages of Orissa and Rajasthan. Providing 
a convenient online hub for market, product and service 
information on mobile phones, vBay will offer entrepreneurs 
in rural communities the ability to post and browse across a 
network of villages and improve their productivity by providing 
daily commodity price updates in addition to job postings. This 
is rural India’s first mobile-enabled classified system designed to 
empower entrepreneurs by broadening their access to market 
information. Training for entrepreneurs is also part of the project, 
helping them to successfully grow their businesses while using 
the vBay system.

In 2007, fishermen in the tsunami-affected Tamil Nadu region of 
India were provided mobile phones with a BREW® application called 
Fisher Friend, which gave them instant access to helpful information 
such as weather conditions, where they can and cannot fish and 
market prices—all in their local language. Today the application is 
commercially available on Tata’s CDMA network for approximately 
US$.60/month. Local fishermen reported that the application 
has made them more efficient, feel safer in the water and has 
improved their daily revenue. One fisherman said his income has 
gone from US$3-$6/day to $10-$16/day. The program is the result 
of a collaboration with M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation 
(MSSRF), a non-profit organization that is instrumental in providing 
information about the fishing communities; Tata Teleservices; Astute 
Systems Technology, the BREW developer; and Wireless Reach. 
Indonesia: Village Phone Microfranchising Program Gives 
Entrepreneurs New Tools for Success
For the last three years, Wireless Reach and the Grameen 
Foundation have collaborated with Indonesian organizations 
to evaluate, test and build the foundation for a Village Phone 
Microfranchising Program in the country. The initiative combines 
the power of microfinance with the benefits of expanding access 
to communications, generating broad positive economic and social 
returns that can bolster an entire community. Village Phone helps 
Indonesians in two important ways: (1) by extending affordable 
telecommunication access to people who cannot afford their own 
mobile device and (2) by offering a profitable business opportunity 
to the base of the pyramid by eliminating barriers to entry: primarily 
in the areas of financing, confidence building, training and access 
to the supply chain. The project demonstrates an innovative and 
sustainable solution that meets the growing demand for affordable 
access to telecommunication services through a microfranchise 
model that is market-oriented and builds on the strength of 
microfinance, one of the most robust poverty alleviation strategies 
in existence today, according to the Grameen Foundation. The core 
concept is simple, effective and sustainable: a local small-business 
entrepreneur purchases a pre-packaged kit that includes a mobile 
phone with a microfinance loan and then retails the “minutes” to 
neighbors. The program provides a business opportunity for the 
base of the pyramid in underserved communities.  
Wireless Reach
With 56 projects in 28 countries, Qualcomm’s Wireless Reach 
initiative is a strategic program that demonstrates how access to 
advanced wireless technology improves people’s lives. Wireless 
Reach supports programs and solutions that bring the benefits of 
3G connectivity to communities globally. Collaborating with more 
than 100 partners from governments, nonprofit organizations 
and the private sector, Wireless Reach invests in projects that 
foster the growth of entrepreneurs, aid in public safety programs, 
enhance the delivery of health care, enrich teaching and learning 
in classrooms and help the environment. 
ITU: Providing Disaster Relief Telecommunications Services
Wireless Reach donated a Qualcomm Deployable Base Station 
(QDBS) to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to 
improve emergency communications for disaster preparedness 
and to coordinate relief activities in the aftermath of a disaster.  
The base station allows relief organizations to communicate 
and coordinate with each other, when there is no other means 
of telecommunications. Based on 3G CDMA technology, the 
QDBS is a compact, quickly deployable and easy to operate 
mobile solution with 50 phones providing first-responder 
communications. The QDBS will be housed at ITU’s headquarters 
in Geneva until it is deployed again.2009 Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report   I   37
United States: Project K-Nect, Wireless Social
Networking and Teaching Enhances Student Achievement
Working with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction 
and Digital Millennial Consulting, Project K-Nect is a Wireless 
Reach funded pilot program that began during the 2007-2008 
school year to discover if 24/7 connected smartphones could play 
a role in enhancing student engagement and learning. The project 
addresses the need to improve math skills among at-risk students 
in North Carolina who scored poorly in math and did not have 
access to the Internet at home. Algebra I digital content aligned 
with the teacher’s lesson plan was created and students were 
encouraged to learn from each other in and out of the classroom 
using collaborative learning applications, as well as other Internet 
resources such as algebra.com. In 2009, Project K-Nect was 
incorporated into algebra II, geometry and biology classes. The 
project also added two more school districts, including an eighth 
and tenth grade class totaling 150 students. For two consecutive 
years, the project has shown success in students’ achievement. 
In classes participating in Project K-Nect, student proficiency 
rates on the state end of course exam increased 30 percent 
when compared to classes taught by the same teacher but not 
participating in the project. And these numbers have not gone 
unnoticed. Based on positive results from Project K-Nect, the 
Department of Defense Education Activity granted a participating 
school district $2.5 million to expand Project K-Nect to all 
algebra I students. 
Vietnam: Transforming the Future Workforce
Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung is focused on 
making the country strong in the development of information 
technology and communication. He has asked the Information 
and Communication Ministry of Vietnam to map out a master plan 
to prioritize the further integration of technology in various areas 
including developing a labor force competent to compete globally.2 
In order to support the government’s goal of boosting 21st century 
skills within its labor force, Wireless Reach is focusing on Vietnam’s 
future group of skilled workers. Collaborating with Room to Read, a 
non-profit dedicated to promoting and enabling global education, 
and S-Fone, a local 3G CDMA operator, Wireless Reach is supporting 
a project that has established computer labs in six secondary 
schools throughout southern Vietnam in the Can Tho province. 
Through the project, the Room to Read computer labs were each 
equipped with 20-25 computers and EV-DO connectivity using 
wireless modems. S-Fone is providing the schools with free Internet 
access until 2012. Along with training sessions for teachers, students 
are now able to attend classes where they learn how to use various 
computer applications and basic skills using the Internet. With most 
of the student population at the participating schools coming from 
low income families, and one school in a region where there is no 
landline connectivity, the computer labs and access to the Internet 
has been a welcome change in their lives.

mainly focused on those with paralysis and Cerebral Palsy. Each of 
the three projects addresses a different group of people in need 
with specially developed text-to-speech software and hardware 
to provide them with connectivity and the ability to communicate. 
Portugal Telecom’s GRID software is used on mobile phones and 
laptops that can be attached to wheelchairs, which allows people 
to type using symbols and communicate with care givers and 
loved ones. For the severely paralyzed, special eye-tracking devices 
and control buttons used with one’s cheek are helpful, allowing 
participants to type using the GRID and text-to-speech capabilities. Kenya:  Timely Medicine Helping People with HIV/AIDS
Wireless Reach has teamed with partners to develop a technology 
intervention program that creates a more efficient process in the 
supply management of antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) using 
3G wireless connectivity.  As part of the project, participating 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) sites in Nairobi, Kenya, have been 
equipped with computers, software and support equipment for 
wireless connectivity on Telkom Kenya’s 3G CDMA EV-DO Rev. 
A network. The software developed in the project is designed to 
automate the manual reporting system for managing ARVs. These 
newly converted electronic reports can reach the Kenya Medical 
Supplies Agency (KEMSA) quickly and efficiently, providing a 
more accurate inventory of ARVs in clinics and pharmacies.  The

Our Community
Qualcomm’s Contributions & Emergency Operations
Global Emergency Management
The Qualcomm Emergency Operations Team’s (EOT) mission 
is to protect our people, business and assets through effective 
emergency planning, response and recovery. The team consists of 
cross functional representation from IT, HR, Employee & Corporate 
Communications, Safety, Security, Legal and Facilities. The EOT 
has a number of on-going initiatives and tools to ensure that we 
can uphold the duty of care which our employees expect. 
Qualcomm Community Emergency Response Team (QCERT)
This program trains employees to respond to a disaster during 
working hours; trainings have been conducted in San Diego, CA
and Raleigh, NC. Several employees in Santa Clara, CA have 
taken the training on their own time. The QCERT members are 
trained in search and rescue, fire suppression, first aid/triage 
and on the Incident Command System. Annually, the San Diego 
team participates in a full scale exercise to refresh their skills. The 
QCERT members are also invited to participate in the CPR/First 
Aid and AED training and other disaster exercises.  Qualcomm 
has a total of 126 trained employees, with 93 in San Diego, 30 in 
Raleigh and 3 in Santa Clara. Many of the QCERT members join 
and get involved with their local community teams, assisting
local first responders when requested.  
Personal Emergency Training Classes
• Creating a Family Survival Plan
 The objectives of this training, held quarterly in San Diego and
 in other Qualcomm locations such as India, Singapore, Atlanta, 
 Santa Clara and Portland offices, are to educate employees on 
 how to prepare themselves and their families for a disaster.  
 The training covers how to create a communication plan, how 
 to document and practice evacuation plans and how to a 
 build a disaster survival kit. Over the past two years, over 
 370 employees have completed the training.
• Ready or Not Survival Training 
 Local San Diego survivalists, Tom Beasley and Susan Conniry, 
 presented their Ready or Not Survival training at Qualcomm in 
 2009; a total of 88 employees attended this interactive and 
 engaging program. This training goes above and beyond the 
 Family Survival Plan training, teaching employees how to build a 
 shelter, collect and filter drinking water, start a fire and store 
 food. This training will be offered twice a year at our 
 San Diego facilities.
Emergency Operations Toolset
The EOT employs the use of several cutting edge software 
systems (or tools) to ensure they are kept informed of worldwide 
events and emergencies.
• Emergency Notification System
 This system communicates with employees during an 
 emergency.  This automated, two-way system delivers messages 
 in a variety of formats (cell phone, home phone, email, SMS 
 text) and confirms message delivery and acknowledgement
  from the recipient. 
• Operational Risk Management
 An automated system sends SMS pages and emails to the EOT,
 alerting the team in near real time about emergencies or events 
 such as fire, terrorism or extreme weather that are occurring  
 close to our facilities worldwide.
• Employee Traveler Location System
 A system to locate travelers during an emergency; flight and 
 hotel information is loaded into the system from our global 
 travel providers. This allows the EOT to act immediately during 
 a critical event by identifying at-risk travelers.
• Emergency Supply Kits
 EOT procures and maintains emergency supply kits for the 
 San Diego offices and assists with the procurement of the kits 
 for our regional and international offices. The kits are intended 
 to be used during a disaster when employees must seek shelter
 at Qualcomm facilities. 
Mumbai Terrorist Attack Response 
In November 2008, both our Corporate EOT and our India EOT 
were activated for several days when the city of Mumbai was 
attacked by a group of terrorists. During the activation, we 
contacted Mumbai employees to ensure their safety as well as 
employees traveling to Mumbai to provide factual information and 
ascertain status and to ensure their security. We also launched a 
comprehensive internal communication campaign to inform our 
employees about the safety of their co-workers.
Red Cross Ready When the Time Comes 
The program trains and certifies employees to help out the 
American Red Cross during a disaster in the San Diego area.  
Employees have been trained in two disciplines—Sheltering and 
Response Center Enterprise (assisting with the American Red 
Cross national call center). The training program, which started in 
2008 and continued in 2009, added an additional 47 employees 
to bring our total trained volunteers to 63 employees. 
Sorrento Valley Consortium 
The Consortium, co-founded and led by Qualcomm, is a group 
of 14 Sorrento Valley-based companies who meet monthly to 
discuss emergency scenarios, share emergency plans, discuss 
available resources and resource sharing and determine how we 
can improve our partnership with city and county governments 
during a regional disaster. In 2009, one of the Consortium’s 
significant accomplishments was strengthening their relationship 
with the San Diego County Office of Emergency Services (OES). 
This relationship will improve communication between OES 
and Consortium members, allowing members to receive early 
notification when the OES activates their Emergency Operation 
Center. The Consortium was proud to receive a proclamation 
from the County of San Diego Board of Supervisors, which 
recognizes them for their extraordinary efforts in advancing 
disaster preparedness and their continuous commitment to 
the community.

A quick response
At the end of April, the Corporate EOT activated 
for the influenza outbreak of H1N1 in Mexico City. 
We held daily conference calls to actively monitor 
the quickly evolving situation, which required 
flexibility and quick decision making from the team. 
As H1N1 spread, we instituted visitor screening at 
Qualcomm facilities worldwide. As the uncertainties 
regarding the mortality rates and the actual death 
toll from the outbreak continued, the team instituted 
restrictions on non-essential travel to Mexico and 
finally restricted all travel to Mexico including a full 
ban effective for three days. From an educational 
perspective, the team launched a mini influenza 
campaign, much like our normal fall influenza 
campaign, including the distribution of posters 
and hand sanitizers. We also increased cleaning 
of all facilities and distributed masks to several of 
our international locations who were impacted by 
government restrictions and public fear.  2009 H1N1 Influenza

Qualcomm health center
Our on-site medical clinic was involved with the 
Corporate EOT from the outset providing guidance 
and advice from a medical perspective. Our Medical 
Director was instrumental in guiding policy and 
procedures applicable to Qualcomm employees 
across the globe. She participated in the production 
of a video addressing those concerns with the best 
information available. Posted on the Qualcomm 
intranet, it was viewed over 1,784 times from 37 
different Qualcomm locations worldwide. The team 
continues to meet and monitor the worldwide 
situation with a goal of ensuring our employees are 
informed and exposure to H1N1 is kept at a minimum 
at our facilities.Since 2004, Qualcomm has donated more than $4.5 million 
to benefit victims of natural disasters around the world.
At Qualcomm, sustainability is a core business value.  As we expand globally, we 
continue to be an industry leader in energy conservation and climate protection.

over year savings for Qualcomm.
Qualcomm is committed to protecting and enhancing our 
environment. As a Company, we consistently strive to minimize 
hazardous materials and reduce consumption of our natural 
resources. Using education and administrative controls, we 
continuously assess our processes and practices to identify 
opportunities for reducing energy, waste and toxic emissions. We 
have implemented best management practices and engineering 
controls to reduce the risk of chemical spills. As a result of the 
prevention measures implemented, Qualcomm experienced 
no significant spills last year. During 2009, Qualcomm had no 
significant fines for non-compliance with environmental laws 
and regulations. Environmental information about our products 
is detailed in the Product Responsibility section of this report, 
beginning on page 14.
Energy Efficiency & Energy Cost Savings
Qualcomm invests in highly efficient energy, lighting, HVAC 
(heating, ventilation and air conditioning) systems, cogeneration 
and renewable energy (photovoltaics) to reduce energy 
consumption, lower building operating expenses and minimize 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The cost savings continue for 
years to come as the energy saved translates into dollar savings
on our monthly utility bills. 
To date, Qualcomm’s energy efficiency investments in over four 
million square feet of building space in California alone have 
saved more than 22.5 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually, 
valued at over $2.92 million savings each year. This is equivalent 
to avoiding 7,390 metric tons of GHG emissions or eliminating the 
annual emissions of 1,343 cars.
U.S. Green Building Council
In August 2009, Qualcomm joined the U.S. Green Building Council 
(USGBC), reaffirming our commitment to energy and water 
efficient green buildings. The USGBC is a member-driven nonprofit 
organization best known for the development of the LEED 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) green building 
rating system. Qualcomm’s one million square foot W Campus
was certified LEED Gold last year and the Company continues 
to implement LEED methodology in our ongoing construction 
projects. Our W Campus represents what we are doing
company-wide to build energy efficiencies and optimize resource 
conservation in our facilities, which ultimately reduces our 
operating costs and contributes to the financial bottom line.Energy Efficiency & Cost Savings

Air Emissions
Qualcomm was recognized for our 2009 efforts to improve air 
quality. We are the first company to be given the new Blue Sky 
Leadership Award, an honor created by the San Diego County 
Air Pollution Control District in partnership with the Industrial 
Environmental Association to highlight a local company that 
demonstrates a commitment to improving air quality and provides 
inspiration for others to do the same. The Blue Sky Leadership 
Award is given to the top performer among local companies and 
organizations named as Clean Air Champions throughout the year.
 
Qualcomm’s two newest cogeneration turbines are fueled by 
natural gas and are highly efficient. These units produce electricity 
for our operations, and the heat generated by them is used to run 
two large chillers for our air conditioning system. The turbines 
reduce airborne pollutants by 35 percent compared to the ones 
they replaced.
Qualcomm further improves air quality through our energy 
conservation efforts. We have installed solar panels on building 
rooftops, own a fleet of hybrid vehicles and encourage and 
incentivize our employees to utilize alternative modes of 
transportation for their daily commute, such as offering transit 
subsidies, shuttle services and bike lockers.08 07 06 05 04CO2 Metric Tons of Emissions

Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Since 2002, Qualcomm has been a member of the California Action 
Registry, a nonprofit voluntary registry for GHG emissions and has 
earned the distinction of “Climate Action Leader” for our early and 
voluntary participation in reporting GHG emissions in California. 
Our overall emissions (per square foot of our facilities space) have 
continued to decrease. While some of our direct and indirect 
consumption metrics have increased, this is a reflection of continued 
growth in our operations and revenues. We do our best to minimize 
the impact our operations have on our global environment.

diligent work toward bettering the environmental impact of our 
cafés, our Food Services team has completed a rigorous 18-step 
process that has improved our water efficiency, implemented a 
full-scale recycling program, introduced chlorine-free paper 
products and made a commitment to sourcing local, sustainable 
and organic foods. We are proud of our environmental efforts in our 
kitchen facilities and look forward to improving and implementing 
even more “green” efficiency in the years to come.
Green Cleaning
Qualcomm’s dedication to a greener, safer environment extends 
into all aspects of day-to-day operations. In 2007, Qualcomm’s 
Building Services team instituted a new cleaning system, 
ManageMen’s® Operating System 1 (OS1)®, as part of our Green 
Cleaning Program. Since then, we have transitioned all our San 
Diego buildings to the OS1 cleaning system, which encompasses 
approximately 4.3 million square feet and services over
10,000 employees. By instituting this new cleaning regimen, 
we have:
 • Reduced the number of cleaning products used from 29 to 4. 
 • Cut chemical use from 3,335 active cleaning units to 303. 
 • Decreased the volume of chemical containers sent to
  landfills by 97 percent.
 • Reduced our annual water and electricity usage.
 • Reduced the amount of paper towel disposal sent to landfills
  by 11.47 tons per year and cut consumption by 16 percent
  by replacing paper towels with microfiber cloths.
 • Generated a $2.2m year over year savings for the Company.
 • Improved worker’s compensation costs by 91 percent.
 • Achieved a 98.8 percent customer satisfaction rate in
  office cleaning requests.
In 2010, we will expand this initiative to include the OS1 Floor care 
cleaning system at our San Diego office buildings. Restaurants throw

2009 Sustainability Highlights
Hong Kong 
Our Hong Kong office implemented a recycling program to 
collect mixed paper and other materials in recycling bins, as well 
as copier toners and batteries. Program guidelines were based 
on United States recycling guidelines. An employee education 
campaign was conducted about the program to encourage 
greater involvement and participation.
India 
Our local employees are encouraged to initiate sustainable 
environmental practices; Mumbai employees are moving away from 
the use of packaged water bottles to reusable bottles thus reducing 
environmental waste and conserving resources. Additionally, 
Qualcomm’s employee volunteer program promotes projects 
that improve our natural surroundings and we financially support 
nonprofit organizations that support sustainable environmental 
programs. For example, Qualcomm supports TERI’s Light a Billion 
Lives Campaign, which brings solar energy to villages which would 
otherwise be in the dark for another decade.
Designing greener facilities with renewable energy sources is an 
important practice followed by the Company; this is especially 
important because buildings account for 40 percent of the world’s 
energy use (Source: World Business Council for Sustainable 
development, “Transforming the Market: Energy Efficiency in 
Buildings”). Qualcomm aims to seek an India Gold “Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)” certification for the 
new building under construction in Bangalore, our solely-owned 
property in India. The Company is leveraging best practices from 
the construction of our United States Gold LEED certified facility 
in San Diego.

Qualcomm’s support will allow The Foundation to build 
on these recent achievements and to promote more 
comprehensive regional action on climate change by 
working with key policy-makers in a high-level “Regional 
Collaborative” around climate change, regional 
transportation, conservation and land-use planning. The 
Foundation is complementing this process by convening 
the region’s relevant nonprofit community to enhance 
partnerships, inform public policy and identify pressing 
unmet needs to accompany government actions. “We are incredibly pleased to be 
partnering with Qualcomm to speak 
to the community about solar energy, 
clean air and renewable lifestyles.”

Executive DirectorUnited States
Qualcomm supported a variety of events to better educate
both our employees and the community as a whole about
various environmental issues, highlighting actions that
individuals, companies and governments can take to make a 
difference including: 
• San Diego Earth Fair
 Qualcomm employees presented the Fair’s 75,000
 attendees with information about the Company’s many
 sustainability programs. 
• Employee Sustainability Fair
 To coincide with Earth Day, Qualcomm set up a Sustainability
 Fair on our San Diego campus with representatives from 
 divisions company-wide as well as presentations by local 
 sustainability experts. The Fair engaged our employees
 globally via recorded environmental lectures and a 
 ‘green ideas’ contest.
• San Diego Solar Energy Week 2009
 Activities focused on bringing together residents and business 
 owners with solar experts, suppliers and installers to explore 
 the benefits of using sunlight for electricity and water heating.
 Hundreds of visitors checked out the 30+ companies and 
 organizations that exhibited solar-related products and services.
• Coastal Cleanup Day 
 Qualcomm adopted a site as part of California’s Coastal Cleanup
 Day. Over 85 employees, families and friends cleaned 6 miles
 near Qualcomm’s campus, collecting 3,200 pounds of trash and
 75 pounds of recyclables. 
• Qualcomm Recycling Day 
 Qualcomm hosted a free on-site recycling collection day, 
 giving San Diego employees the opportunity to recycle personal 
 electronics, donate used eyeglasses and cell phones and 
 exchange inefficient light bulbs for energy saving compact 
 fluorescent light bulbs.Qualcomm provided financial support for The
San Diego Foundation’s regional Climate Initiative. 
Launched in 2006, this initiative is dedicated to 
advancing comprehensive action throughout
San Diego County to reduce local greenhouse gas 
emissions and enhance the region’s resilience to 
climate change.2009 Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report   I   49I   2009 Qualcomm Social Responsibility Report 50
