2018-2019 Social Responsibility Report
2
ABOUT THIS REPORT
This Social Responsibility Report is the first for our company. Following the 
sale of the European vacation rentals business and the spin-off of the hotel 
business, our continuing operations are concentrated in three segments: 
Vacation Ownership, Exchange, and Rentals. In this report, we build upon 
our former holding company’s award-winning social responsibility programs, 
while also charting a new and exciting course as Wyndham Destinations. 
We used the Global Reporting Initiative Standards to inform the scope of this 
report’s data and content. 
This report summarizes 2018 performance. Wherever possible, we have 
aimed to provide historical data only including Vacation Ownership, 
Exchange, and Rentals.3

Executive Oversight
Our commitment to inclusion and diversity, as well as 
accountability for performance, begins at the highest levels.  
Michael Brown, President and CEO, is executive champion 
of inclusion and diversity, and engages directly with senior 
executives to ensure integrated efforts and initiatives across  
our global company.13
 GLOBAL INCLUSION & DIVERSITY
OUR MISSION  
AND FOCUS  
AREAS
We invite every person regardless of race, color, religion, 
veteran status, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, 
sex, gender identity and expression, age, marital status, 
mental or physical disability, medical condition, sexual 
orientation or any other characteristics protected by law 
to feel acceptance and experience the opportunity to 
contribute within Wyndham Destinations. We strive to 
provide opportunity, education, resources, leadership, and 
a voice to every person so that we may collectively deliver a 
rewarding, memorable, and successful experience. Vacations 
allow people of all backgrounds to meet and celebrate their 
differences, and our business strives to provide a memorable 
experience to everyone.
The Wyndham Destinations’ global inclusion and diversity 
strategy is anchored by the following three focus areas:What is 
“intersectionality”? 
As defined by the Merriam-Webster 
dictionary: “intersectionality” is the 
complex, cumulative way in which 
the effects of multiple forms of 
discrimination (such as racism, sexism, 
and classism) combine, overlap, or 
intersect, especially in the experiences  
of marginalized individuals or groups.
Why is it a strategic 
priority for Wyndham 
Destinations?
We recognize that within our diversity 
strategy, it is important to acknowledge 
intersectionality. Millennials comprise 
45% of our workforce, and have proven 
to hold a generationally unique view of 
diversity — largely because millennials 
are the most culturally and racially 
diverse generation so far. This means 
they often associate with a number of 
different identities. Just one example 
of intersectionality may be a Hispanic 
millennial veteran who also identifies as 
LGBTQ. By embracing and appreciating 
all identities, we create an inclusive 
culture and a sense of belonging. 
When considering intersectionality 
from the perspective of our customers, 
Wyndham Destinations recognizes 
that the demographics of our customers 
are continually evolving. Millennials 
also serve as an apt example here: As 
more customers within this generation 
leverage the flexibility that vacation 
ownership has to offer, it is imperative 
that Wyndham Destinations ensures our 
brand reflects a comprehensive spirit of 
inclusion and diversity. FOCUS AREAS OBJECTIVES
Inclusion Continue to elevate, cultivate, 
and drive an inclusive culture 
within Wyndham Destinations.
Affinity Promote sense of belonging, 
while appreciating differences 
and acknowledging 
intersectionality.
Marketplace 
PresenceProvide thought leadership; 
remain a global employer of 
choice across all indicators of 
diversity for our customers and 
associates; and support diverse 
suppliers in local markets and 
communities.14
 GLOBAL INCLUSION & DIVERSITY 
Developing an Inclusive Culture  
Wyndham Destinations is committed to shaping a culture 
where each individual is embraced as they are, and where 
each associate is valued as a contributor at every level within 
the organization to deliver a memorable experience for our 
guests and owners. 
Our inclusive talent acquisition strategy focuses on 
developing a diverse pipeline of candidates that includes 
applicants from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and 
experiences. This includes women, people of color, veterans, 
those with disabilities, mature job seekers, and more.  We understand the strategic importance of inclusion and 
how an inclusive environment empowers our associates. 
We continue to tailor our learning and development strategy 
to help retain, grow, and build a diverse pipeline of internal 
applicants through various developmental programs at  
every level.
We leverage our inclusion and diversity initiatives as a 
business accelerator to advance the company’s four  
core competencies , the key strengths and behaviors of 
our team that serve as measurable qualities of excellence: 
Customer Obsession , Decision Velocity , T ransparency , 
and Empowerment .

Introducing “Inclusion 
by Wyndham”
The Asia Pacific team is one 
of our most effective regions to 
acknowledge, appreciate, and 
celebrate various dimensions of 
diversity. 
In 2018, the business launched 
“Inclusion by Wyndham” — an 
initiative to recognize what makes 
each individual unique, and to 
identify the common values that 
allow us to connect as our authentic 
selves. As part of this initiative, 
associates have been identified 
as Inclusion Ambassadors, who 
champion a business unit or location 
for various inclusion initiatives in 
order to promote awareness and 
inclusion, and to foster a sense of 
belonging across a broad spectrum

Strengthening Our Company through Associate  
Business Groups and their Supporters and Allies  
Wyndham Destinations hosts dedicated Associate Business Groups for our 
Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, LGBTQ, Veteran, and Women 
associates. Each of the Wyndham Destinations Associate Business Groups 
are designed to enable associates across various indicators of diversity to 
create communities and teams that support our business expansion process, 
personal development, and affiliation with colleagues across the business. 
Our current established Associate Business Group structure is a partial 
representation of who we are; hence through our inclusion efforts we are 
intentional and mindful to include all voices to ensure various spectrums of 
diversity are welcomed, appreciated, and valued. 
With the cultural shift and changing workforce demographics — especially 
considering the growing global millennial workforce — we encourage 
conversations within Associate Business Groups to address intersectionality 
and further elevate inclusion, sense of belonging, and increase associate 
engagement within the workplace.   
Additionally, we host a global program for our millennial workforce, where 
identified millennials across the business provide their insights on key business 
decisions and strategic projects. The unique viewpoints of this group are vital 
to the growth of our business — particularly considering 30% of timeshare 
owners are millennials. AFFINITYWyndham

Supporting Diverse Suppliers  
Across Markets 
The Wyndham Destinations supplier diversity 
initiative seeks to provide equal access to 
all suppliers for procurement opportunities. 
Diverse businesses include those owned 
by Women, African-Americans, Hispanic-
Americans, Asian-Americans, Native-
Americans, LGBTQ+, Veterans, and People 
with Disabilities.
The Wyndham Destinations supplier diversity 
initiative continues to grow, earning many 
distinguished industry recognitions along the 
way. Our mission, however, remains steadfast: 
to develop and implement an approach to 
supplier diversity that achieves results and 
adds value to our business strategy and 
objectives, while contributing to the economic 
vitality and job growth in the communities 
where we live, work, and play.A Results-Oriented Approach
Our supplier diversity objectives are: to 
increase corporate spending with diverse 
suppliers, to increase the number of diverse 
suppliers with which we do business, and 
to grow and enhance our diverse business 
community outreach.   
To achieve these objectives, Wyndham 
Destinations engages in a results-oriented 
approach. We consider supplier diversity 
early in the procurement process and identify 
potential new opportunities for diverse 
suppliers. 
The business relies upon our strategic 
sourcing team to ensure maximum return 
on procurement investment, guaranteeing 
that diverse suppliers are included in each 
request for proposal. We then evaluate diverse 
suppliers and their bids from perspectives of 
market competition and to gauge secondary 
benefits of engagement. These secondary 
benefits can include increased marketing 
opportunities, improved community relations, 
mentorship of current and potential Wyndham 
Destinations suppliers, expansion of our 
diverse business community outreach, and 
expanded participation in diversity events.

SIGNA TURE PROGRAMS HOW WE ARE DRIVING IMPACT
The Academy Biennially, Wyndham Destinations convenes diverse 
suppliers to spend a full-day with our company’s executives. 
We share the company’s strategic vision and objectives for 
the coming years, present pertinent business topics relating 
to department operations, and share tips on how to navigate 
corporate America. Our suppliers also share best practices, 
and the event concludes with a one-on-one matchmaking 
session, where we pair the suppliers with our procurement 
decision makers.  
Mentor-Protégé Program Our Mentor-Protégé Program is a 12-month mentorship 
program designed to provide business development 
assistance to promising diverse businesses. Over the course 
of the year, mentors evaluate and measure the protégé’s 
progress.
This program was created to help develop the capability 
and capacity of diverse businesses to provide products and 
services to large corporations like Wyndham Destinations. 
Supplier Diversity Council The Orlando, Florida-based Supplier Diversity Council was 
initiated, and has been sponsored and chaired by Wyndham 
Destinations since inception. The council’s membership is 
comprised exclusively of local corporate supplier diversity 
leaders — including Walt Disney World Resort and Duke 
Energy — diverse suppliers, and presidents of diverse 
advocacy groups in the community, including MBA Orlando 
and the local LGBTQ chamber of commerce. 
The primary focus of the Supplier Diversity Council is to 
discuss shared interests and understand how each member 
can best work together to increase opportunities for the local 
diverse business community. 
The council also offers a “Certification Reimbursement 
Program” for diverse suppliers. Wyndham Destinations, 
through the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, reimburses 
participating diverse suppliers (regardless of the diverse 
classification) that are successfully certified.    GLOBAL INCLUSION & DIVERSITY 
The Wyndham Destinations supplier diversity initiative is supported  
by three signature programs:21
Expanding Our Reach Among  
Second Tier Suppliers 
A key objective of the Wyndham Destinations supplier diversity 
initiative is to ensure that our prime suppliers understand 
the business case for engaging diverse suppliers and the 
competitive advantage that these partnerships bring to our 
organization, mutual interests, and the community. Wyndham 
Destinations requests that prime suppliers actively seek-out 
qualified, diverse suppliers capable of providing competitive, 
high-quality products and services in order to support business 
objectives, and to support the development of diverse suppliers 
through mentoring and outreach.  
Our second-tier procurement program has experienced 
strong growth over the past couple of years. Thirty of our prime 
suppliers have adopted credible supplier diversity initiatives 
that support our program. These efforts have led to increased 
business opportunities for diverse suppliers.

RECOGNITION 
In 2019, Wyndham Destinations received a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index, and were 
named one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality. The company was also named Best-of-the-Best Corporations for 
Inclusion by the National Business Inclusion Consortium (NBIC). We are recognized by Forbes in three areas; Best Employers 
for new Graduates, Best Employers for Diversity, and Best Employers in Canada. We are also recognized as a Noteworthy 
Company and Top Companies for LGBT Employees by Diversity Inc. 
Our recognition in Forbes’ first-ever list of America’s Best 
Employers for New Graduates is incredibly exciting. This 
achievement is a wonderful reminder of why we should all be 
proud to work for a company that promotes inclusion, social 
responsibility, comprehensive benefits, and rallies behind a 
single vision — to put the world on vacation.”

location in which we operate remains a breath of fresh air. By engaging

 ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
Reducing Our Environmental Footprint
Wyndham Destinations applies a number of environmental sustainability strategies, programs, and goals with the shared 
purpose of reducing energy, emissions, water, and waste, while improving our biodiversity impact.
T racking and Monitoring our Data
Wyndham Destinations tracks our environmental 
footprint using a proprietary online environmental 
management system, which was developed to manage 
our energy, emissions, water, and waste globally — 
including the ability to share dashboards that measure 
key performance indicators and goals. This innovative 
toolbox was created to be flexible, scalable, and 
customizable.26
Wyndham Destinations is committed to reducing carbon 
emissions per square foot by 40% by 2025, compared to our 
2010 baseline. We track performance against the baseline 
using an intensity of CO 2 equivalent per square foot across 
our portfolio of more than 500 locations. By implementing 
our environmental sustainability strategy and increased 
efficiency measures, we have already reduced our scope 
1 and scope 2 carbon emissions intensity by 24% , while 
increasing our overall portfolio square footage by 15% .Wyndham Destinations uses a combination of proven 
conservation strategies and energy efficiency retrofits to 
achieve on-going reductions in energy and emissions.  
For example, 96% of our resorts have enacted the following 
low cost measures: 
1.  Energy efficient lighting  in units, common areas,  
and back of house
2.  Motion sensors  for lighting in common-area  
restrooms, break rooms, and storage rooms
3. Default settings for in-unit HVAC systems 
4. Energy misers for refrigerated drink machines
In addition to these low-cost efficiency projects, our Home 
Owners Associations have invested over $6.5 million in 
energy efficiency capital projects  that have included 
upgrades and replacements to HVAC systems, cooling 
towers, pumps, variable frequency drives, air handling units, 
and windows.

Business T ravel Emission Reduction
Wyndham Destinations is committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions 
from business travel through two signature programs:
SIGNA TURE  
PROGRAMSHOW WE ARE DRIVING IMPACT
United Airlines  
Eco-Skies Carbon 
Choice ProgramThe Eco-Skies Carbon Choice program enables 
the corporate customers of United Airlines to 
track and offset emissions related to business 
travel. Through this program, United Airlines 
provides customized enterprise level carbon 
emissions reports to counterbalance the 
emissions associated with air travel. Wyndham 
Destinations has offset the carbon with the 
Big Smile Wind Farm at the Dempsey Ridge in 
Oklahoma, which is estimated to deliver enough 
clean energy to power more than 46,000 U.S. 
homes annually.
Avis Budget Carbon 
Offset ProgramIn partnership with Avis Budget, Wyndham 
Destinations offsets corporate car rentals 
through a partnership with NextEra. Avis 
Budget contributes $0.50 per rental day to the 
EarthERA Renewable Energy T rust. The T rust 
uses 100% of the funds it receives to build new 
renewable energy facilities and projects.
Accelerating 
Renewable Energy 
Wyndham Destinations continues 
to grow our portfolio of on-site 
solar projects. In 2018, we 
completed installation of our 
14th project, dating back to 2015. 
This has resulted in cumulative 
production of 6,660 MWh of 
alternative energy. 
These projects are financed using 
a power purchase agreement, 
which lowers the total cost of 
energy while reducing our overall 
carbon footprint. Through 2018, 
these projects contributed to 
decreasing estimated business 
costs by more than $370,000. 
During the same time period, they 
also combined for an aggregated 
15% decrease in carbon from a 
market-based approach.  ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

Project Champions of Energy Efficiency Awards and 
Luncheon. The Legacy Golf Resort was recognized 
under the “Outstanding Energy Efficiency” category, 
which is given to businesses that have saved the  
highest percentage of energy.
With the help of Salt River Project, The Legacy  
Golf Resort has made investments and behavioral 
changes across the property that have led to an 
estimated 62% annual energy savings.

Wyndham Destinations is committed to reducing water 
usage per square foot by 25% by 2025, compared to 
our 2010 baseline. We track performance against the 
baseline using an intensity of water usage per square foot 
to normalize across our portfolio of properties. Through 
targeted projects and water efficiency measures, we have 
already reduced our water usage intensity by 23% , while 
increasing our overall portfolio square footage by 15% .
Our water conservation strategies are focused at the 
resort level and include low- to no-cost upgrades that save 
both water consumption and operating costs. In 2018, 
96% of our resorts had the following water conservation 
measures in place: 
1.   Smart timing for landscaping irrigation 
2.  Low flow showerheads 
3.  Exterior water saving sensors ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

RESORT SPOTLIGHT:  
WorldMark Big Bear  
and WorldMark Indio   
Over the past four years, WorldMark Big Bear has  
reduced its irrigation water consumption by more than 40% 
through xeriscaping practices, which saved over 5 million 
gallons of water during a drought period in the region. 
WorldMark Indio has also made tremendous strides to 
reduce water consumption resort-wide. Over a two-year 
period, the resort was able to reduce its potable water 
consumption by 20% — or more than 11.6 million gallons  
of water — by switching to more efficient sprinkler heads, 
watering perimeter trees at the resort with non-potable 
canal water, aerating the grass during the summer to reduce 
the amount of exterior water needed, and reducing grass 
and overall square footage required for irrigation.
Through these efforts, both WorldMark Big Bear  
and Indio have demonstrated a commitment to  
conserving water by using innovative solutions. ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

WASTE
Waste is a complex, global challenge for the travel and tourism 
industry and throughout the world. Waste costs are increasing 
due to diminishing landfill space, while legislation for diversion 
is becoming increasingly stringent.
To tackle the problem of waste, our plan is simple. Wyndham 
Destinations is launching a program to reduce, donate, 
and recycle waste using tools and strategic partnerships 
that support property participation. We are targeting the 
following waste streams: glass, plastic, aluminum, paper, 
soap, cardboard, food, lamps, batteries, e-waste, mattresses, 
furniture, linens, and carpet. Using this waste hierarchy, we are 
concentrating our focus on the base of the pyramid.Targeting  
Single-Use Plastics
In 2018, Wyndham Destinations 
Asia Pacific took significant action 
against single-use plastics by 
removing disposable plastic straws 
from managed resorts and hotels, 
and banning balloons at events 
across 33 locations . 
Balloons, when released outdoors, 
can end up in our waterways, 
oceans, and parklands; and can 
cause damage to our environment 
and species. Staff in Asia Pacific 
have committed to use alternative, 
plastic-free, and reusable 
decorations at resort and corporate 
events. 
As of July 1, 2019, plastic straws 
will be removed at all resorts within 
the Wyndham Destinations Asia 
Pacific region. By offering paper 
straws, upon request, the region will 
eliminate nearly 400,000 plastic 
straws per year.

Establishing a Baseline
Wyndham Destinations is committed to establishing a 
credible waste baseline to measure our progress by 2022.
Wyndham Destinations continues to implement innovative 
waste management practices throughout the organization. In 
2018, 96%  of our resorts engaged in the following practices: 
1.    Commercial, back of house, front of house,  
and administrative office recycling
2.  Common area recycling available to guests 
3.  In-unit recycle programs 
4.  Fluorescent bulb and battery recycling 
5.  CFC refrigerant recycling 
6.  Toner and cartridge recycling
7.   Elimination of bottled water
8.  Paper conservation 
9.  Elimination of styrofoam at refreshment stations ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
Education and Engagement
Education and engagement are central to our waste 
management strategy. 20% of Wyndham Destinations-
managed vacation club resorts are enrolled in a national 
program that includes enhanced education, reporting for 
recycling, and landfill diversion. This program resulted in an 
average diversion rate of 32% .
In 2018, associates at our corporate headquarters also 
gathered to shop hundreds of used office items donated for 
a swap event. Donated items ranged from used technology 
equipment and boxes of opened paper clips and staples, 
to pens and paper pads. The event promoted reuse and 
reduction, while at the same time saving dollars by re-
purposing hundreds of needed office supplies. 
Paper Recycling
Wyndham Destinations resorts and offices throughout North 
America have a comprehensive shredding and recycling 
program in place through its partnership with Shred-it. 
Critical to our partnership with Shred-it is the assurance 
that all destroyed documents are actively recycled. After 
the paper is securely shredded, the confetti-sized pieces of 
paper are bundled and recycled into paper products. In 2018, 
1,700,000 lbs of paper were recycled and 14,000 trees 
were saved as a result.33
BIODIVERSITY
Wyndham Destinations is committed to protecting fragile habitats and 
conserving biodiversity. Over the past 10 years, we have preserved millions of 
square feet of rainforest lands, improved the lives of thousands of farmers and 
their families, and helped to restore the planet’s ecosystem — all through a 
focus on trees. Wyndham Destinations has offset nearly 215,000 metric tons 
of carbon by purchasing and serving shade-grown coffee from Peru within our 
resorts and corporate offices, and by planting trees along the Mississippi River 
Valley through our partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation. Since 2008, we 
have planted over 
1.5 million trees 
and purchased 
more than 2 million 
pounds of shade-
grown coffee.  ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

SUPPLY CHAIN
Wyndham Destinations actively seeks suppliers who share our commitment to protecting the environment. Through our 
Supplier Code of Conduct, we require all suppliers to abide by all federal, state, and local environmental laws. Wyndham 
Destinations favors suppliers that work to sustain, protect, and restore the environment — through energy conservation, 
recycling and proper disposal of waste, and environmental restoration. 
Wyndham Destinations has several programs, relationships, and product requirements to maintain a responsible supply chain,

MAXIMIZING BUILDING AND  
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 
As part of the Wyndham Destinations commitment to environmental sustainability, we are focused on maximizing building 
performance by incorporating leading-edge practices across our portfolio. We use our own Green Certification program, LEED®, 
ENERGY STAR, and other certifications, ratings, and standards to guide our progress.
Green Certification Program
Wyndham Destinations has a robust and integrated 
environmental certification program for its managed 
vacation club properties. Since 2010, the program has been 
driving performance improvements across all areas of our 
environmental footprint. The Wyndham Destinations Green 
Certification Program is based on the premise that every 
managed vacation club property should be consistent in 
its approach to environmental stewardship and should 
highlight the incremental improvement of each resort’s 
environmental impact. As such, individual resorts are 
annually measured by the Wyndham Destinations quality 
assurance team to determine the resort’s front- and back-
of-house daily environmental practices.
The Wyndham Destinations Green Certification Program 
is continually evolving and is updated annually to promote 
new sustainability practices that place our focus on 
energy, water, and waste reduction. The program focuses on leadership development as well as improving team 
and associate engagement. It also promotes sharing 
and recognizing green practices at the resort level with 
members, owners, and guests. Credit for the certification 
requires daily initiatives in the following categories: 
waste reduction, water conservation, green purchasing, 
environmental education, energy conservation and 
greenhouse gas reduction, recycling, and community 
involvement. Every year the criteria is reviewed and 
improved for consistency with overall company goals and 
increased drivers of performance. 
Successful adoption of the required practices, in addition to 
the implementation of more advanced innovations, results 
in higher levels of program recognition and achievement 
all the way up to the highest — Crystal Green Certification. 
Recognition plaques for the Green Certification Program 
proudly hang in resort lobbies to remind associates and 
guests of that resort’s commitment to green practices.   ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

The RCI Green Award
RCI recognizes the most environmentally conscious resorts within the 
company’s exchange network through the RCI Green Award, which 
celebrates RCI-affiliated resorts that actively engage in sustainable 
practices. To determine which resorts lead the industry in sustainability,  
RCI partners with an independent organization to assess and rate applicants 
for the awards program. Applicants are judged on their innovations in energy 
and water conservation, waste management, community outreach, and 
environmental management.RESORT SPOTLIGHT:

Club Wyndham Midtown 45, 
a vacation club resort located

has been recognized by the 
Mayor’s office in  
New York as first in the 
vacation ownership 
sector, and second in the 
overarching hospitality 
industry, to achieve the 
Mayor’s challenge  of reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions  
by 30%.
38Accepting the Challenge
The company joined the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings Challenge  
with a goal to reduce energy usage intensity (EUI) 20% by 2020, based on a 
combined 10,000,000 square feet of select hotels and resorts. By December, 
2017, the company had reduced energy by 16%. Due to the spinoff of Wyndham 
Hotels & Resorts in 2018, and the reduction in our overall corporate footprint, 
Wyndham Destinations is actively working with the Department of Energy to 
develop a new 10-year, 20% EUI reduction target for managed resorts and 
corporate locations, totaling over 25,000,000 square feet of building space 
(over 80% of our portfolio). 39
ENGAGING  
ASSOCIATES,  
OWNERS & GUESTS
To deliver on our environmental goals, Wyndham Destinations strives to 
engage meaningfully with associates, owners, and guests to support the 
sustainability and resiliency of destinations within our portfolio.
Associate Engagement 
Wyndham Destinations provides associates with sustainability training 
geared to newly-hired associates, office-based staff, engineers, housekeeping 
staff, and general resort management teams. Achieving Everyday 
Sustainability is a series of web-based training modules offered online and 
driven by the Green Certification Program. Functional areas that receive 
specialized training include housekeeping, front desk, and maintenance 
teams. Additionally, resort staff are offered energy conservation training 
through the Schneider Electric Energy University.
All Wyndham Destinations vacation club resorts and most corporate offices 
have Green Teams that are responsible for energy tracking and performance 
improvement. Green Teams drive associate engagement and participation 
around environmental days of awareness and celebration such as Earth Hour, 
Earth Day, and Worldwide Green Day.
Wyndham Destinations promotes best practices across our vacation 
club resort portfolio through sustainability-focused activities, events, and 
recognition programs. A great example of this is Caught Green Handed —  
a program that allows resort- and corporate-based associates to nominate 
co-workers for going the extra mile to promote sustainability in the workplace. 
Quarterly, the Wyndham Destinations Green Council votes on nominees 
for the Caught Green Handed award. The single winner best illustrates our 
commitment to deliver great vacations while also ensuring environmental 
responsibility. In 2018, 
Wyndham 
Destinations 
celebrated 
Earth Day 
and internally 
promote a 
Worldwide 
Green Day  
with a 
campaign to 
break the habit 
of single-use 
plastics.  ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY40
Owner and Guest Engagement  
At a resort level, Wyndham Destinations actively engages 
owners and guests to celebrate the environment and 
participate in sustainability-focused activities.  All vacation 
club resort units are equipped with recycling bags, eco-logo 
dish soap, and laundry detergent.
 
Vacationing children are also engaged 
in our environmental sustainability 
efforts through a mobile application 
created internally. Children are 
encouraged to download the free app 
— it’s a fun and interactive way  
for kids of all ages to learn about recycling and taking care 
of the environment while on vacation. You can download the 
app for free by searching for Binny’s Recycling Adventure in 
the App Store for Apple devices or the Google Play store for 
Android devices.

and the Wyndham Destinations Associate Relief Fund.Going Beyond 
Strategic 
Partnerships:  
Step Up For 
Students
The Wyndham Destinations 
commitment to philanthropy 
expands to charitable 
organizations beyond our 
core alliances. Since 2011, 
Wyndham Destinations 
has maintained a corporate 
partnership with Step Up  
For Students. 
Step Up For Students is a 
nonprofit organization that 
administers the Florida Tax 
Credit Scholarships Program, 
which provides scholarships 
to qualified low-income 
families throughout Florida. 
Scholarships are funded 
by corporations (including 
Wyndham Destinations) that 
receive a dollar-for-dollar tax 
credit for their contributions. 
The program allows recipients to 
choose between scholarships to 
help with private school tuition 
and fees, or a transportation 
scholarship to attend an out-of-
district public school. 
Approximately 116,000 
children used the income-based 
scholarship in 2018. In the same 
year, Wyndham Destinations 
contributed $1,000,000 to the 
scholarship program, totaling 
more than $6,500,000 since 
partnering with Step up for 
Students in 2011.  PHILANTHROPY45
Give Kids the World Village 
Give Kids The World is an 84-acre, non-profit “storybook” 
resort in Central Florida where children with critical 
illnesses and their families are treated to weeklong, cost-
free vacations. Each year, 27,000 children in the U.S. are 
diagnosed with a critical illness — half of all children eligible 
for a wish through a wish-granting organization choose to 
visit Central Florida and its collection of theme parks and 
other attractions.For the past six years, Wyndham Destinations has 
sponsored the Stars & Pars Golf Tournament — a 
community fundraising event for Give Kids the World 
Village. The golf tournament received its name from the 
Stars that are given to each child who visits the Village, 
which are left behind and displayed in the Castle of  
Miracles on the property.
 
At the sixth annual Stars & Pars Weekend in 2018, more 
than 75 Wyndham Destinations associates across various 
departments, as well as partners from the community, 
came together to lead and coordinate the event, which 
features a signature golf tournament and gala with live and 
silent auction. Since 2013, the event has donated more than 
$700,000 in support of Give Kids the World. PHILANTHROPY46
Jack and Jill Late Stage

The Jack and Jill Late Stage Cancer Foundation 
is dedicated to “treating families to WOW! 
Experiences®, by giving children who will lose 
their Mom or Dad to cancer a timeout in order  
to create indispensable memories as a family… 
while they can .” 
Closely aligned to the mission of the Wyndham 
Destinations philanthropy commitment — to improve 
the lives of children and families through vacations 
— the Jack and Jill Late Stage Cancer Foundation 
(JAJF) helps provide vacation experiences for more 
than 100 families each year, creating cherished 
memories and experiences that positively impact the 
lives of families close to losing a parent.Founded by Jon Albert in 2006, JAJF partners with 
Oncologists across the United States to identify 
parents of minor children who are faced with a late-

to vacation and spend family time with their children. 
Since 2015, Wyndham Destinations has partnered 
with the organization to support families across 
the country at many vacation clubs resorts, where 
associates and on-site staff ensure a seamless and 
memorable experience for those staying with them, 
many for their last family vacation. 
With the help of Wyndham Destinations, we look 
forward to maintaining this significant role in the 
lives of children and families. As we continue this 
purposeful partnership, we are able to impact these

Christel House International
Christel House International has been a core component of our 
philanthropy program for many years. Wyndham Destinations’ 
ties with Christel House were established by Christel DeHaan, 
who co-founded RCI in 1974. After creating the largest 
timeshare exchange company in the world, Christel founded 
Christel House International in 1998. Wyndham Destinations 
proudly supports the mission of Christel House International, 
and takes great pride in knowing that through our support, the 
lives of deserving children around the world are transformed 
for the better. 
Christel House works with more than 4,000 poverty-
stricken children each year, going far beyond supplying basic 
survival needs. They give children healthcare, educational 
opportunities, positive role models, job placement assistance, 
and access to community outreach programs. 
The Christel House mission is to transform the lives of 
impoverished children around the world — breaking the cycle 
of poverty and building self-sufficient, contributing members of 
society. Both Christel House and Wyndham Destinations share  
the belief that progress is measured one child at a time. 
Associates of Wyndham Destinations contribute year-round 
to Christel House through fundraisers, ongoing donations, 
and volunteer hours. In 2018, Wyndham Destinations and 
associates across the organization donated more than 
$293,000 in cash and in-kind donations. PHILANTHROPY

associated with the fund to ensure each dollar collected by 
associates goes directly to associates in need.
Administered by the independent non-profit Emergency 
Assistance Foundation, the Associate Relief Fund was 
founded in 2016. It has helped provide assistance to more 
than 729 associates who have experienced a personal 
hardship, or who were directly impacted by a natural disaster 
such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. PHILANTHROPY

Since 2001, the RCI India team has partnered 
with FAME India, an organization focused 
on helping children and adults affected with 
moderate to severe neuro development 
disabilities (NDD). FAME India makes a lifelong 
commitment to each person affected with NDD, 
which is referred to as the Full-Circle Approach; 
providing care and resources for impacted 
children and adults throughout the duration 
of their lives as life changes occur. RCI India 
supports the ongoing education program of 
Samarth I and II batch. Each batch consists of 9 
special needs children.
Children with special needs in Samarth 
benefit from learning pre-vocational skills that 
prepare them for the future. Teachers aim to 
prepare students for a job that is within their 
abilities by helping them develop skills related 
to safety, personal care, time management, 
and endurance. Students are given various 
opportunities to exhibit their talents — through 
dance, drama, singing, leadership, and more. 
Various pre-vocational skills are also included 
in their curriculum such as tailoring, paperwork, 
office administration, housekeeping, kitchen 
work, computer work, and more. 
Every year, RCI India celebrates Children’s Day 
(November 14) with the FAME students.For the sixth straight year, Wyndham 
Destinations associates in Las Vegas spread 
holiday cheer to local children through their 
annual Giving Tree service project. Las Vegas-
based associates adopted an at-risk elementary 
school and collected wish lists from each child. 
In 2018, more than 90 associates arrived at the 
school to deliver hundreds of new gifts to more 
than 500 children. They also provided gifts and 
lunch for teachers and staff.
Since 2016, the team in Las Vegas has paired 
with MLK Jr.  Elementary as their Giving Tree 
recipient due to the level of need of students. 
All students at MLK Jr. qualify for free lunch and 
breakfast, a significant amount of the population 
are transient, many are homeless, and most are 
learning English as a second language. Over 
the past several years the many needs of these 
students has inspired the Las Vegas coalition to 
raise money and organize several other projects 
to help the school, including providing backpacks, 
school supplies, books, shoes, and socks for all 
students, as well as painting classrooms.Wyndham Destinations

Aligned with our global commitment to ethics and compliance, Wyndham Destinations enforces ethical practices through the 
company’s Code of Conduct . The Code of Conduct outlines the company’s expectations of all associates and serves to foster a 
culture of compliance and transparency within the organization. In addition to our associates, all stakeholders within the Wyndham 
Destinations value chain — suppliers and resort developers — are required to operate in a manner that is compliant with all 
applicable laws.
The Wyndham Destinations Code of Conduct includes topics that range from equal and fair treatment of associates, owners, and 
guests; health and safety; conflicts of interest; protecting our information; anti-corruption; and financial and reporting integrity. 
CODE OF CONDUCT   ETHICS AND HUMAN RIGHTS53
Wyndham Destinations expects its suppliers to conduct 
business through ethical standards consistent with our own. 
This includes treating others fairly, with dignity and respect; 
avoiding actual and potential conflicts of interest; and 
safeguarding all Wyndham Destinations assets.These standards and expectations are set forth in the 
Wyndham Destinations Supplier Code of Conduct , with 
which all suppliers must acknowledge and comply. In 
the Supplier Code of Conduct, we strictly prohibit the 
use of child labor, and expect that our suppliers provide 
transparency into their business operations and take action 
to tackle modern slavery throughout their own supply chain, 
consistent with disclosure obligations under the UK Modern 
Slavery Act 2015.
Wyndham Destinations also evaluates suppliers through 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) database, 
which screens for any individual or company that might have 
sanctions against them for being tied to a targeting foreign 
country, narcotics traffickers, or engaged in activities related 
to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, 
suppliers are required to complete Anti-Corruption 
Awareness Training.

Wyndham Destinations offers a variety of associate training 
opportunities with a clear and concise curriculum. The 
formalized training programs are offered in a variety of 
formats — including online and instructor-led courses — 
to address all business needs and audiences across the 
organization. In 2019, Wyndham Destinations launched 
enhanced and simplified training for associates focused on 
the Code of Conduct, Anti-Corruption, and Information and 
Privacy Management. Wyndham Destinations maintains a strict anti-retaliation 
policy which encourages the reporting of any concerns 
without fear of retaliation. Options for communicating 
concerns include reporting to a manager, Human Resources 
business partner, the Ethics and Compliance team, or 
through the Wyntegrity hotline. Wyntegrity  is the Wyndham 
Destinations internal reporting hotline, which is managed by 
a third-party to ensure anonymity and available 24/7.
The Wyndham Destinations Ethics and Compliance team 
partners with Human Resources, Legal, Internal Audit, 
and Information Technology to investigate and address 
concerns. The EthicsPoint reporting tool is also used as our 
case management system, where details of the case, actions 
taken, and remediation are captured. Data is analyzed to 
measure the effectiveness of the Ethics and Compliance 
program and to identify ways to prevent, detect, and 
measure future misconduct. Wyndham Destinations also 
has a consistent progressive disciplinary process to address 
substantiated allegations. TRAINING,

A Strict Stance Against Bribery  
and Corruption
Wyndham Destinations is committed to doing business 
with honesty, integrity, and in an ethical manner. This means 
that we do our best to avoid and prevent corruption of all 
kinds. We are committed to compliance with all applicable 
anti-corruption laws, including local laws in every country in 
which we do or intend to do business. In addition to our  
Code of Conduct, we maintain our Anti-Corruption, Conflict 
of Interest, and International Trade Control Policies to 
manage risks associated with bribery and corruption. 
Wyndham Destinations has implemented processes to 
back up our policies and controls in place to alert if there is a 
potential concern.  We intentionally focus on advancing the awareness of our 
company’s strict anti-corruption measure through more 
simplified policies, communication, and training. With the 
launch of the Code of Conduct and accompanying policies 
in 2019, our message is clear: we have zero tolerance for 
unethical practices. Associates have a duty to speak up, 
and we are all accountable to ensure that our policies are 
followed.
As part of our communication strategy, we host ad-hoc 
trainings throughout the year to enhance awareness and 
development. We communicate to associates through 
surveys, Wyndham Nation (the company intranet), and 
in-office communication tools (including internal television 
monitors and posters) as methods to further integrate our 
anti-corruption policies. We are enhancing our contracts 
administration and third-party due diligence processes to 
better support risk assessments and mitigation strategies 
within our value chain.
 ETHICS AND HUMAN RIGHTS56
Wyndham Destinations is committed to protecting human

T aking a Stand Against the Exploitation of Children 
Wyndham Destinations condemns all forms of the exploitation of children, including but not limited to, child labor and sexual 
exploitation.  The company is supportive of laws enacted to prevent and punish the crime of sexual exploitation, and cooperates 
with law enforcement authorities to address such instances. 
Wyndham Destinations is the first vacation ownership company to 
sign the T ourism Child-Protection Code of Conduct, and to enforce 
required training and education to associates globally in order to 
protect children from exploitation. The travel and tourism industry has an opportunity 
to play an important role in preventing the 
exploitation of children. By partnering with EC PAT  
International  and signing The Tourism Child-
Protection Code of Conduct, we have taken a 
stand against the commercial sexual exploitation 
of children. The Tourism Child-Protection Code 
of Conduct is an industry-driven responsible 
tourism initiative in collaboration with ECPAT. It was 
founded by UNICEF International and supported 
by The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), which is specifically focused on protecting children 
from sexual exploitation in the travel and tourism 
industry. 
As a subscriber to The Code, Wyndham 
Destinations commits to enhancing all policies 
condemning child trafficking, and providing training 
to associates globally. The training includes the 
proper tools and resources for identifying and 
reporting potential trafficking activities at any of the 
company’s locations globally.

Corporate Governance and Risk Management 
Strong corporate governance is an integral part of our operations and values,  
and our Board of Directors is committed to exercising sound corporate governance 
principles and practices. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, together with the 
charters of the Audit, Compensation Governance, and Executive Committees of 
the Board, provide the framework for effective governance. 
Our Chairman
The Wyndham Destinations Board of Directors is led by Stephen P. Holmes,  
former CEO of Wyndham Worldwide, who serves as our non-executive chairman. 
Mr. Holmes’ experience as the former CEO and his knowledge and familiarity with 
our business and industry bring a valuable perspective to the Board.  
In his role, Mr. Holmes continues to provide leadership to the Board by, among 
other things, working with the CEO of Wyndham Destinations, the Lead Director, 
and the Corporate Secretary to facilitate effective operation of the Board and its 
committees; assisting in consideration and Board adoption of the company’s  
long-term and annual operating plans; and helping to promote senior management 
succession planning. 
 
The Role of Independent Directors
The Wyndham Destinations Board of Directors recognizes the importance 
of having independent Board leadership. We have appointed an independent 
Lead Director, and six of eight current directors are independent.  The Audit, 
Compensation, and Corporate Governance Committees are comprised solely 
of independent directors. Our independent directors, led by Lead Director, bring 
experience, oversight and expertise from outside Wyndham Destinations and our 
industry, which balances the company-specific experience and expertise that our 
non-executive chairman and CEO bring to the Board. RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS

Board Oversight Over Economic,  
Social, and Environmental Risks
The Wyndham Destinations Board of Directors focuses 
on the most significant risks facing the business and our 
general risk management strategy, and seeks to ensure 
that risks undertaken are consistent with a level of risk that 
is appropriate and aligned with the achievement of our 
business objectives and strategies.
The Audit Committee provides oversight for risk assessment 
and risk management, including financial accounting 
and reporting, internal audit, information technology, 
cybersecurity, and compliance. The Compensation 
Committee oversees assessment and management of 
risks relating to executive compensation. The Corporate 
Governance Committee provides oversight to management 
of risks associated with the independence of the Board and 
potential conflicts of interest. While each committee is responsible for providing oversight 
with respect to the management of risks, the entire Board of 
Directors is regularly informed about risk through committee 
reports and management presentations. This includes 
briefings and oversight of the Wyndham Destinations social 
responsibility program and its most material issues, including 
Inclusion and Diversity, Environmental Sustainability, 
Philanthropy, and Ethics and Human Rights.
Our CEO and other senior executives are responsible for 
day-to-day risk management analysis and mitigation, and 
report to the full Board of Directors or relevant committee 
regarding risk management. We believe this division of 
responsibility and leadership structure is the most effective 
approach to manage and mitigate risk throughout the 
business.  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS

Our Business Continuity Plan (BCP) 
The Wyndham Destinations Business Continuity Team 
ensures our global assets — including corporate offices and 
managed resorts — have emergency preparedness plans 
in place that are specific to each individual site based on the 
potential risks. These plans include associate assistance 
plans, communication plans, and site-specific plans for 
dealing with and recovering from an incident.
The Wyndham Destinations Business Continuity Plan  
(BCP) Steering Team, comprised of key leaders from select 
departments (IT, HR, Facilities, and Safety & Security), 
provides the scope and goals for the program. Each year, the 
BCP models an annual lifecycle, ensuring plans are up-to-
date and tested.
Our Communications Plan ensures we are able to 
communicate with our owners, guests, and associates 
during and after an incident. Our Emergency Closure Plan is 
designed to provide consistency for shutting down corporate 
locations, ensuring all necessary business functions 
are cared for. Our Pandemic Plan provides guidance for handling illnesses that are impacting a region (i.e. Zika Virus) 
or location (i.e. Norovirus). Additionally, our Emergency 
Preparedness Guide, which assists leaders in responding 
to a number of different situations. The Associate Disaster 
Benefit Plan was created to ensure our associates receive 
personal support during an incident.
Safety for Associates, Owners,  
and Customers 
Disasters come in all shapes and sizes. Initial estimates 
predict the cost of natural disasters to be $155 billion in 
2018, including 14 events with losses exceeding $1 billion 
each across the United States. Over the past 5 years, the 
average number of events exceeding $1 billion has doubled 
to 12.6 events per year from 6.2 events per year from 1980- 
2013. The increase in these events leaves businesses more 
susceptible to existing and emerging impacts. The mission 
of Wyndham Destinations is to put the world on vacation. 
Mitigating incidents through developing business continuity 
strategies across our organization allows us to provide the 
utmost safety to our owners and guests. RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS

Loyalty Program: Wyndham Rewards
Wyndham Destinations is a proud partner of Wyndham Hotels &

enables Wyndham Rewards members to earn points for qualified 
stays at Wyndham Destinations properties. A 100-year partnership 
has been established with Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, and

thousands of vacation experiences around the world. Wyndham 
Destinations actively engages our Wyndham Rewards members to

are able to leverage the points structure to vacation their way.  
We emphasize the benefits of Wyndham Rewards with our owners 
and guests through pre-arrival communications, during check-
in, during post-vacation communications, and through ongoing 
marketing communications with our owners. Because Wyndham 
Rewards members typically represent the vacation ownership 
target market — proven through higher close rates and higher

Responsible Marketing
Wyndham Destinations has developed programs to 
help ensure that timeshare owners are well-informed 
and not subject to any predatory and/or misleading 
practices, notably through our Ovation by Wyndham and 
Scambusters programs.
Scambusters
Launched in 2016, Scambusters is an initiative focused 
on gathering and sharing details about third-party 
companies and who could potentially harm owners. 
Some of these entities make claims to help owners with 
their timeshare or assist them in exiting their ownership, 
when in fact, they charge predatory fees and offer little 
to no support to the owner. The Wyndham Destinations 
Scambusters program provides owners with a safe 
and secure outlet to report any suspicious activity 
they experience. Wyndham Destinations then uses 
this information to monitor and analyze the impact of 
reported scams, and create strategies to educate and 
protect our owners. RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS
Ovation by Wyndham
Ovation by Wyndham launched in February 2015 as a 
revolutionary program designed to assist our valued 
owners with a free, safe, and secure timeshare exit if their 
vacation needs change. Ovation by Wyndham eliminates 
the need for paid-in-full owners to seek support from 
unscrupulous third-party companies who may harm and 
defraud our owners. The Ovation program is equipped  
with several options, enabling Wyndham Destinations  
to offer the best solution to address our owners’ specific 
exit needs. 
Options for owners seeking to exit may include: 
1.   Limited Edition , which allows owners to exit their 
timeshare and continue to travel for three years at 
no additional cost.
2.  Tribute by Wyndham , which allows owners to 
transfer their ownership to an immediate family

3.  Featured Reseller , which is a referral to a trusted

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS’ REVIEW REPORT
To the Board of Directors
Wyndham Destinations, Inc.
Orlando, Florida
We have reviewed the following indicators presented in the Social Responsibility Report (the “ specified 
indicators ”) of Wyndham Destinations Incorporated (the “Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2018:  
•GRI Disclosure 302-1: Energy consumption within the organization
•GRI Disclosure 302-3: Energy Intensity 
•GRI Disclosure 303-1: Water withdrawal by source
•GRI Disclosure 305-1: Direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1)
•GRI Disclo sure 305-2: Energy indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 2)
•GRI Disclosure 305-3: Other indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope3)  
•GRI Disclosure 305-4: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity
•GRI Disclosure 405-1: Diversity of governance bodies and employees
•GRI Disclosure 102-8: Information on employees and other workers
The Company’s management is responsible for preparing and presenting the above specified indicators in 
accordance with Disclosures 302 -1 and 302-3 from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting 
Standards 302: Energy 2016, Disclosure 303-1 from the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 303 : Water 2016,
Disclosures 305- 1, 305-2, 305 -3 and 305- 4 from the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 305: Emissions 
2016, Disclosure 405- 1 from the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity 
2016, and Disclosure 102- 8 from the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 102: General Disclosures 2016. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the specified indicators based on our review . 
Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT -C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements,
and AT -C Section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to 
obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the specified indicators in 
order for them to be presented in accordance with the criteria. A review is substantially less in scope than an 
examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the specified indicators are 
presented in accordance with the criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we 
do not express such an opinion. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.
In performing our review, we have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of 
Professional Conduct issued by the AICPA. We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established 
by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.   
Information presented for periods prior to fiscal year 2018, was not reviewed by us and, accordingly, we do not 
express any assurance on them. 
The preparation of the specified indicators within the Social Responsibility Report requires management to 
interpret the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported information. Measurement of certain amounts , some of which may be 
referred to as estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertaint yresulting for example from 
units of measure conversion factors or estimation assumptions used by management. Obtaining sufficient, 
appropriate review evidence to support our conclusion does not reduce the inherent uncertainty in the amounts 
and metrics. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement methods, input data, or 
assumptions, may have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.
