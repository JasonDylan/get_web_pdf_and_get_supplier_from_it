PGS: 2017Sustainability 
Reporting:  
our Reflections
Letter from the CEO
This is our sixth responsibility report. Together, 
these reports document the Company’s commitment to providing a safe working environment, our ability to adapt to changing circumstances, and our will to survive without compromising our core values. 
At the end of 2017 , PGS embarked on a program to 
centralize, simplify and streamline its organization. Driven by the economic imperatives of a smaller and weaker market, we needed to reduce costs. Tough decisions were taken as we restructured our business to thrive in the current market. Dilemmas force us to examine our choices. What are our responsibilities to our people, the environment, society and our stakeholders; and how can we increase efficiency, without impacting safety and security?
To act as a catalyst for growth and innovation, corporate 
responsibility must be relevant. We continue to fully support the principles of the UN Global Compact and strive to develop our ambitions towards sustainable value creation. This year’s report is inspired by the UN sustainability goals. We have pinpointed those we perceive as most relevant to our business, and analyzed how they impact PGS actions and ambitions. 
As ever, I welcome feedback and ideas from our 
stakeholders. I look forward to hearing from you.

Corporate Responsibility ReportPGS finalized a materiality analysis in 
2016, based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators for sustainable development. The purpose was to identify the issues that are most important to us and our stakeholders. We identified the five most significant 
sustainability areas for our business:
Health, safety and security of our people
Ensuring compliance with law and avoiding corruption 
Managing impacts on the marine environment
Employee development
Customer satisfaction
In 2017 , we examined these issues in more depth, to understand at which stage in our value chain each indicator is most relevant and how they relate to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.Materiality

PGS: 2017From a PGS Perspective 
In September 2015, UN member countries 
adopted a set of Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the 
planet, and ensure prosperity for all, as part of a new sustainable development agenda.  
Each goal aspires to achieve specific targets over a 
15-year period. Although the most ambitious goals 
are addressed to governments and authorities, 
overall success is dependent on everyone doing their part: both public and private sectors, civil society, organizations and individuals. The concept 
and framework encourage participation at all levels, 
from large corporations to individuals in small remote villages.  As a signatory to UN Global Compact, PGS analyzed 
the SDGs in the light of its strategic priorities. We compared each of the 17 goals to the high-priority issues defined in our materiality analysis and identified four goals that are particularly relevant for us: 
Over the next few pages, we provide an overview 
of how we address the challenges underlying the UN SDGs relevant to us. We will continue to use the SDGs to shape our corporate responsibility strategy.

PGS: 2017Focus areas 
Restructuring and downsizing The fundamentals of our industry have changed significantly in recent years. Our market is smaller, weaker, and exhibits a rising level of uncertainty. In 2017 , the PGS management, backed by the Board of Directors, decided to restructure the business to address the current market situation and position the Company for a sustainable future. The objectives of the restructuring were to centralize, simplify and streamline the organization. As a result, from 2018, we have two business areas: Sales & Services, and Operations & Technology. We have also made our fleet model leaner and more responsive to seasonal market fluctuations.
Unfortunately, these initiatives involved staff 
reductions in all parts of the business, both offshore and in our offices. We had to let go approximately 500 loyal and valued employees.  A voluntary redundancy program, based on age and seniority, was offered to our seismic crews and some of our maritime crews and office employees. Workforce reduction processes in our offices around the globe followed local rules and regulations. We worked closely with all stakeholders, including unions and employees, to ensure that the process was fair, transparent and guided by our core values. 
This was a challenging and stressful time for 
everyone involved, but our people continued performing to the highest standards.
Protecting health, safety and 
security for our people  Assessment and mitigation of risk, to PGS people and assets, are at the heart of how we manage our business. Our health and safety performance has significantly improved over the years. To ensure we maintain and further improve our performance in the future, we have identified a number of long-term focus areas, some of which are outlined below. Risk and security management Risk is a central theme in everything we do. It is at the heart of our operational planning and decision-making. In 2017 , we further optimized this approach by strengthening the quality of  our risk and security management systems.
A work verification process was fully implemented 
onboard all PGS vessels. This involved verifying compliance for our most critical activities, as identified in the Key Safety Risks we introduced in 2015. Offshore management are personally involved in the identification and ongoing review of all project-related risks and implementation  
of mitigation measures.
We further optimized PGS’ security and crisis 
management processes including emergency response management in projects. 
Health management 
The health and wellbeing of people working for PGS is of utmost importance to us. During 2017 , we took steps to integrate health management across all our operations. All vessels in the PGS fleet have established dynamic health risk profiles that define their top five health risks and measures for mitigation of these wherever they are working across the world.
Last year, we improved our medical examination 
program to ensure a common standard for all medical examinations. Our crewmembers undergo biennial medical checks at approved clinics and the results are monitored by our medical services provider. The program generates annual health trending reports that enable us to pinpoint what steps to take in the future, to ensure that our crews remain healthy and fit for offshore work.

Corporate Responsibility ReportImplementation of HSEQ Strategy 2017-2021 
We started implementing our HSEQ Strategy for the period 2017 – 2021 last year. The strategy establishes a platform upon which we can achieve further improvement in our HSEQ performance over the coming years. To secure company-wide awareness and understanding of our strategy, we developed an information campaign that explained the building blocks and how these relate to the day-to-day activities of each employee.
Incident improvement initiative
The number of high potential incidents and near misses involving workboat operations and interaction with fishing vessels increased in 2017 . In response, we developed a fleet-wide workboat incident awareness campaign aimed at reviewing and implementing PGS best practices and identifying ways to prevent future incidents. 
People survey 
We monitor the satisfaction, motivation and loyalty of our employees worldwide through a biennial global people survey, benchmarked against the Enova Employee Index (EEI).
The global people survey aims to answer two  
key questions:
How satisfied, motivated and loyal is a given 
group of employees?
How does a manager create satisfaction, 
motivation and loyalty amongst this group  of employees?
The 2017 survey once again achieved an impressive 
response rate of 92%. Traditionally, PGS employee engagement has been high and PGS continues to register a stable score on employee satisfaction and motivation despite the ongoing challenging market situation. The 2017 results set a valuable benchmark for the new organization. Our priority  
is to maintain and further improve the satisfaction, motivation and loyalty of our employees.
Employee development through 
management training Competent, strong leaders are essential to our success and in 2016, we initiated a global management-training initiative called the “Leading Others Program” . Last year, we extended the initiative. Approximately 120 first-line managers have now graduated from the program since it was implemented. 
Participants rate the program as useful, relevant, 
and one that brings about positive developments in their working processes. Quality

PGS: 2017“Motivation for change is essential if 
we want to see real improvements in 
our managers, ” says our Global Learning & 
Development Manager. “This will eventually 
also result in the further development for our employees, 
he adds.
Unique simulator course – One Culture initiative 
PGS cooperated with Kongsberg Digital to develop simulator training for all offshore leaders working on our seismic vessels. In the safe environment of the simulator, participants encounter and practice dealing with challenging situations based on real offshore events. 
A custom-built PGS simulator suite based on 
the actual design and requirements of our vessels has been set up at the state-of-the-art simulator park at the University College of Southeast Norway. Using full-action scenarios, the simulator gives the feeling of being onboard a seismic vessel. A unique aspect of this course is the fact that the entire operational leadership team trains together: seismic crewmembers work alongside maritime engineers and navigators. 
“It is paramount for a company to create 
a good culture among its crew, ” says Paul 
Courtenay, Senior Vice-President Project Delivery 
at PGS. “We aim to create one culture 
rather than several subcultures aboard 
our vessels, ” he adds. When the crew trains 
together on critical tasks, it creates a positive 
effect on the entire team culture. The better they work together, the better the results. This leads  to less damage to equipment and fewer injuries.
Looking ahead 
A key priority for 2018 will be to empower the new leaner, project-driven organization to fulfill our strategic ambitions. The result, we hope, will be greater efficiency and sustainability, without compromising our core values. We will continue working to reduce personal injury and serious incidents. As part of this, we will implement a campaign focused on how we safely and respectfully collaborate and interact with fishing vessels during seismic surveys.

Corporate Responsibility ReportThrough a cooperation with the Norwegian Academy 
of Science and Letters that began in 2011, PGS helps promote mathematical education among young people in Norway and abroad. We believe that math skills are essential to the future success of the Company, our industry and the planet. Among the programs we support is the Niels Henrik Abel mathematics competition for high school students. The number of entries has grown steadily over recent years, and in 2017 over 4300 students participated.
The Abel stipend supports international projects for 
MSc students, encouraging excellence in the students and the supported programs. In Ghana, NIMS (a center for mathematics) is furthering the education of around 20 MSc and PhD candidates.
Matematikk.org is directed at school children from 1st 
to 13th grade, their teachers and parents. The website and associated apps are run by the math faculties of five Norwegian universities (Agder, Bergen, NTNU, Oslo, Tromsø). The website, which encourages young people to experience mathematics as useful, fun and exciting, registered 2.7 million unique users in 2017  
and awarded diplomas to over 740 000 players.Abel: Supporting

PGS: 2017In August 2017 Hurricane Harvey hit Houston.  
The impact was unprecedented and devastating for 
the U.S. oil capital. Many thousands of people were affected, including PGS employees. As homes, offices and assets were destroyed or damaged, streets and sometimes whole neighborhoods temporarily inaccessible, the safety and well-being of our colleagues and their families were our first priority.      
Locally, our first line emergency response 
team focused on supporting PGS employees and facilities in the affected area. Second-line support was activated in London and Oslo, while business continuity was managed by corporate management.
Information flow was a challenge for employees 
with no access to office facilities. PGS put its crisis information management system to full use. Managers reached out to their teams and reported back, an emergency phone line was set up, regular updates sent by SMS and email. While alternative offices were identified and prepared, many teams relied on remote working, meeting in coffee shops around the city. Globally, colleagues were kept informed via our intranet. 
Our Global IT organization rapidly transferred critical 
IT services that are usually run out of Houston to Oslo and London, and all data was secured. Meanwhile, our Computing Infrastructure team secured the continuous operation of our seismic data processing center.
Throughout, people helped people. Colleagues 
helped to clear flood damage and offer temporary shelter or extra cars to those affected. A voluntary contribution scheme raised 15 000 USD from individuals around the Company and PGS matched their contributions to total more than 30 000 USD.Houston Flooding

PGS: 2017Focus areas 
Protecting the ocean environment  The oceans are our workplace, and we are very much aware that we not alone out there. Conducting our work in a responsible manner means complying with applicable legal requirements, planning and executing our surveys in a manner that minimizes impact on marine life and other users of the oceans, and using technology that enables efficient and careful collection of high-quality data.
Minimizing the acoustic impact of our operations on cetaceans, 
fish and other life below water remains our first priority. We continuously examine our methods, through modeling and advanced research into alternative seismic source technology. In 2017 our research and development teams were actively involved in several separate projects that each may lead to measurable reductions in the acoustic impact of seismic surveys on life below water.
We believe that improving common knowledge and 
understanding of the oceans is to our shared advantage. To this end, in 2017 we launched a global data sharing initiative (see case study). Through this mechanism, we share oceanographic data collected during our surveys with academic institutions across the world.
As members of the International Association of Geophysical 
Contractors (IAGC), we support the ‘Ghost Net Initiative’ by actively removing marine debris like abandoned or damaged fishing gear (nets, lines etc.). In 2017 , we also proposed a novel approach to removing plastic pollution from the world’s oceans using our unique seismic vessels, competence and experience from offshore work (see case study).
Responding to climate change 
The world is faced with the dilemma of meeting energy demands while avoiding climate change and reducing our impact on the environment. Climate change is a serious threat to society, the environment and to our own business.
We are committed to reducing emissions from our own 
operations. By improving our energy efficiency, voyage planning, logistics and using novel technology we strive to continually reduce emissions of greenhouse gases per unit of data collected.
Our operations technical team has a target of reducing drag 
from towed equipment to achieve a significant fall in vessel fuel consumption. This goal will be achieved through many incremental improvements in technology and towing practices.
Looking ahead 
Our goal for 2018 is to develop a next-generation strategy for our seismic sources that will further reduce the environmental impact of our seismic operations. On land and offshore, energy efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions will continue to be a key priority for us in 2018.

Corporate Responsibility ReportSince 1991, we have acquired huge 
volumes of seismic data of the ocean subsurface all over the world. In addition to seismic data, we have also gathered great amounts of surplus oceanographic data including ocean temperature and salinity, depth profiles, currents and weather conditions.
In 2017 , we decided to open our surplus 
database for the benefit of research on the ocean developments. Our first data sharing agreement was signed with the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (Havforskningsinstituttet) in late July.
“PGS surplus data gives us access 
to information through the water 
column, down to approximately  
2 000 meters from many different places, which is valuable from a 
scientific perspective, ”
said Geir Huse, 
Research Director at the Institute of 
Marine Research. “We look forward to 
put these data sets into use. We 
are hopeful they can provide us 
with better insights and improve our understanding of the oceans. ”Global Ocean

PGS: 2017Each year, eight million tons of plastic ends up in the world’s 
oceans - equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the sea every minute. If no action is taken, within a generation pollution is expected to double and double again: so two garbage trucks per minute by 2030 and four garbage trucks per minute by 2050.
In 2017 , we launched a concept for efficient, large-scale collection 
of plastic from the oceans. The solution uses the inherent benefits of seismic vessels, taking advantage of their air compressors and capabilities for handling large towing configurations.
Seismic vessels are equipped with very large onboard 
compressors, which usually supply the seismic source. These are instead used to pump air through a ventilated hose, towed at approximately 50 meters water depth between the seismic ship and a support vessel. The air bubbles produced by the hose attach to the submerged plastic, which then rises to the surface, just like bubbles are attracted to a straw in a glass of sparkling water. A processing unit at the end of the collection spread separates organic materials from plastic. The latter is compressed and packaged into super-strong synthetic skins. Once full, each skin section is marked by GPS and AIS, ready to be collected and towed to a processing facility for recycling.
Cleaning the oceans of plastic is a global responsibility and PGS 
is currently investigating the viability of using our cold-stacked vessels for plastic collection. We are seeking external funding for a pilot test of the system in 2018.Plastic Collection

Corporate Responsibility ReportConduct
Ensuring compliance with the 
law and avoiding corruption is of high importance to PGS and its stakeholders. Through development and communication of clear rules, combined with compliance audits, we ensure that we follow laws and regulations and apply our policies without any form of discrimination.
18
PGS: 2017Focus areas 
Ensuring compliance with law and avoiding corruptionWe are committed to being a just, ethical, compliant and accountable company at all levels. Our focus is on building lasting solutions to combat corruption in all our business dealings. PGS employees participate in regular e-learning, with additional face-to-face dilemma training for those most at risk. Our agents and representatives are subject to thorough background checks and take part in regular training. The PGS supply chain management systems ensure our contractors and sub-contractors are bound by agreements that prohibit unethical or illegal activities. To remain assured that neither our representatives nor we are crossing the line, we also perform regular audits and monitor contracts and transactions.
Safeguarding human rights 
PGS respects internationally-recognized human rights principles. We apply the PGS Code of Conduct, the principles expressed in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and ILO Core Conventions on Labor Standards as guidance to uphold our values globally, throughout all our activities.
As a company with global presence, operating 
in countries at different stages of development when it comes to human rights, we are conscious of the risk we face of potential human rights violations.
While we assess our risk of being directly 
involved in such violations as relatively low, indirect association with infringement of human rights through our line of contractors is not implausible. This is why our focus in the last few years has been to monitor our contractors’ actions in relation to human rights.
In 2017 , we reviewed our processes to identify 
initiatives to raise awareness around human rights in our supply chain. We also revised both the self-assessment form used in the prequalification of new contractors, and the checklists used in audits of existing contractors, to highlight potential human rights issues. Finally, we launched a Supplier Portal on our corporate website to enable easier access to the PGS’ policies and procedures referred to in our agreements with contractors.     
Our supplier risk-assessment tool helps us 
define and implement preventative action against activities in our supply chain that may cause potential exposure to human rights infringement. 
Strategic supplier conduct 
We continue to manage our supply chain closely, with clear due diligence procedures, to identify and address any corruption risk. This includes interviews, questionnaires, background and reference checks, as well as training and annual re-certification to ensure continuous awareness. For suppliers with high-risk exposure we repeat the qualification process, including a full due-diligence report, every third year.  
Looking ahead
In 2018 we will continue seeking opportunities to advance just and strong business relations and practices, promoting these through our own exemplary conduct, and interactions with our partners and contractors.

Corporate Responsibility ReportPGS is a proud member of the Maritime Anti-
Corruption Network (MACN). MACN is a global business network working towards the vision of a maritime industry free of corruption. During 2017 , MACN continued to develop its strong platform to better understand the challenges and execute on its strategy, which focuses on capacity building in the maritime industry, driving global collective initiatives against corruption, and building partnerships to improve integrity. By end of 2017 , MACN had collected over 8 600 incidents, anonymously reported by shipping companies on corrupt demands faced by seafarers globally. MACN has actively engaged with stakeholders, including governments, regulators and non-governmental organizations on shared solutions to improve integrity standards in port operations specifically  
as well as more broadly in the industry. 
PGS has been an instrumental player in MACN’s Suez 
Canal Say No campaign. Since its launch in 2015, the campaign has been largely successful. Feedback and incident data show that in 2017 , companies taking part in the campaign are transiting Suez without any delays or issues. Demands for cigarettes have decreased dramatically or have even been eliminated, while threats to the safety of both crew and vessel have also decreased significantly.
PGS’ involvement in MACN demonstrates our 
commitment to reduce the risk of corruption in the areas we operate and beyond and brings us a step forward in our journey of advancing the SDG goals related to just and accountable business practices.Promoting Responsible
