114The sustainability performance of Chunghwa Telecom in 2017 was extraordinary, due to the combined efforts of all employees. 
Besides being selected as an index component on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for the 6th consecutive year, 
MSCI Taiwan ESG Leaders Index and the FTSE4Good Emerging Index, we were also one of the first group of enterprises 
included in the FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index. Our fruitful achievements in sustainability included:
The first telecom operator in Taiwan to publish the CSR Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative Standards,
which was 2 years ahead of the relative regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.
We led in Green Power Procurement in Taiwan‚Äôs telecom industry for 3 consecutive years. We support the government indeveloping renewable energy and have bought 12 million kW of clean energy over 3 years.
We are the leading telecom operator in the amount of energy generated from self-built solar power plants, with a totalcapacity of 527 kWp. The amount of carbon saved equals the total amount absorbed by the Daan Park in Taipei per year.
We are the first telecom operator in Taiwan to join the CDP Supply Chain Project and promote the sustainability managementof the supply chain thoroughly. With our suppliers, we are marching toward the future of environmental sustainability.
We received the Exercise Enterprise Certification for 2 consecutive years, and also many Sports Promoter Awards.
We supported the Taipei 2017 Universiade, the largest global sporting event in Taiwan that year, with the social participationamount of NT$ 100 million.
‚ÄúChunghwa Telecom can do more‚Äù has always been our core principle. In addition to industry development and competition, 
we also focus on the voice of internal and external stakeholders. We listen carefully and respond to the need of society, as we use our core expertise in the information and communication technology to actively respond to the expectations from the 
consumers, investors, shareholders, communities and society. 
The telecom industry is now facing an era where mobile revenue has surpassed that of the traditional voice business and has 
become the main source of revenue. At the same time, we are also facing Internet market saturation, the highly competitive 
domestic telecom market and challenges from the growth of the IoT and the innovative applications industry. We developed a 
diverse layout strategy in 2017 and continue to improve the basic infrastructure of the broadband to provide support for various industries in the development of the digital economy. We foster the prosperity of innovative application of information and 
communication technology, and we grasp opportunities in startup industry growth. Furthermore, we continue to collaborate 
Message
from the
Chairman
with industrial partners and schools to build a new environment for digital economic development, to reach the goal of ‚Äúbeing 
the motivator of digital economy and the pilot of creative industry‚Äù as the leader in the new era of digital economy.
As for the attraction and the maintenance of talent, we increased the average overall salary in 2017 to reduce the impact of the 
coming tide of retirement on human resources and operations. The average salary increase was 3.54% and the maximum was 
5%. By adopting a competitive remuneration system, we hope to keep our young and excellent employees while attracting 
more talent to join the CHT family, and be the first choice in the telecom service industry for the new generation.
Chunghwa Telecom is responding to the continuing deterioration of global natural resources, the environment and its ecology, 
as well as the social perspectives, with concrete actions. In addition to the promotion of 5G (Green) sustainable strategic plans, 
‚Äúenergy, procurement, operation, store and supply chain,‚Äù we are developing environmental green products as well. Chunghwa 
Telecom has been transforming into a full scale ‚Äúgreen corporation,‚Äù and sparing no effort in the two main social aspects, which 
are: ‚ÄúMinimizing the digital divide‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreating digital opportunities.‚Äù We are connecting the outcome of social communion 
over the years to actively promote social innovation and digital inclusion.
We publicly adopted the ‚Äú5I-SDGs‚Äù initiative in 2017 and now stand beside the UN SDGs to connect Taiwan to the world in an 
official response and engagement. We have also used our core competence to respond to the DIGI+ Project goal of the ‚ÄúDigital 
Country ¬∑ Innovative Economy‚Äù of the Executive Yuan. By using our influence on society, we are completing our digital inclusion 
range to protect information and to give equal rights to all in this Internet and digital era.
We hope to strengthen the connections of our CSR spirit and the local communities in Taiwan with the aids of our relations with 
partners and the promotion of corporate volunteers. The connections between the underprivileged and the diverse groups and 
the digital economic era are supported by the sharing and communicating of knowledge, technology and resources. Through 
these, we link the ‚Äúcycle of kindness‚Äù to realize a win-win situation in terms of digital human rights and innovative economy. We 
hope that you can continue to give us support and encouragement.

Industry Value Chain
Due to technological advancements, boundaries of specialized markets that we used to know of are starting to shift, thus 
allowing industry participants to compete outside of their dominant markets. IDC has even combined ICT, e-Commerce, 
Electronics and Entertainment into a new segment called eICT to recognize the increasingly common cross-industry 
collaboration. 
The wave of digital convergence brings new values to the telecom industry and opportunities to meet users‚Äô needs by offering 
innovative eICT services, which makes content providers and integrators, application service providers, network equipment 
suppliers and terminal equipment suppliers the important value partners to a telecom carrier in the development of digital 
convergence services.

Creating Value for Shareholders
Chunghwa Telecom business operations have been stable for years. Profitability and financial completeness have been 
uninterrupted. We pay our taxes honestly, following the law, and make a solid contribution to the country. Despite the existence 
of many challenges in the telecom operation environment, we maintain complete focus on our field and create value for the 
shareholders. Chunghwa Telecom generated consolidated revenues totaling NT$ 227.5 billion in 2017, a decrease of 1.1% from 2016 and this represented a 98.4% accomplishment rate given the financial forecast for the current year.
The increasing popularity of smart mobile devices, information security, and the IoT technology, has resulted in a growth in 
revenue from value-added services, sales, and data subscriptions that covered the decline in voice services. Net income 
attributable to the parent company amounted to NT$ 38.9 billion while EPS reached NT$ 5.01 with a full-year accomplishment rate of 105.5%.
In 2017, Chunghwa Telecom income tax was the equivalent of an effective tax rate of 16.57%. The deviation from statutory 
17% tax rate was mainly attributed to the provisions of Article 4 of Income Tax Act, in that net dividends or net earnings recognized from local invested businesses are exempt from income tax. The application can be made for tax preference 
pursuant to Article 10 of the Statute for Industrial Innovation.

and ‚ÄúProcedures for Ethical Management and Guidelines for Conduct.‚Äù These are formulated as a basic ethical guideline to 
ensure that all employees engage in all activities with the highest standard. In addition to these codes being included in the 
training program for new hires, all employees are required to log into the web, review the material and take a test annually. A 
hotline was set to encourage employees to voice opinions safely and confidentially. All employees participated in the test in 
2017 except for those who were not available for a legitimate reason at the time of the test.
Chunghwa Telecom has prepared the ‚ÄúEmployee Appraisal Guidelines‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmployee Reward/ Disciplinary Standards‚Äù for the 
evaluation of performance. Rewards and sanctions are applied according to these rules whenever employees exhibit conduct 
deserving of them. Information such as a grievance hotline has been made available on the Chunghwa Telecom intranet/
employee portal. A total of 47 internal complaint cases (disciplinary and leak investigations) were accepted and closed in 2017. 
Six were associated with violation of the code of conduct (there were no corruption events). All complaints were investigated 
and handled according to company internal policies and principles, and taught as case studies to strengthen employee esteem 
for the rules, discipline, corporate image, and shareholders‚Äô interests.Prevention of Corruption

Our CSR issues and actions have created sound economic, environmental and social value. Although we have made serious 
efforts to adapt quantized data when setting-up and managing CSR plans, targets and performance, we have come to realize 
the difficulty of quantizing environmental and social values. There is still lots of true value that cannot be realized with the

We have always thought that ‚ÄúChunghwa Telecom is not just Chunghwa Telecom,‚Äù it is much more. As the leading brand in the 
telecom industry in Taiwan, CHT focuses on industry development and competition. In addition to good products, services and 
profits, we also use our influence to give back to society. We also pay close attention to the voices of our internal and external 
stakeholders before making careful responses to the needs of society.
The identification of the stakeholders and their issues is a very important part of the practice of CSR. We have established a 
stakeholder identification and negotiation process in accordance with AA 1000SES (2015), interacting and communicating with 
stakeholders through diverse channels.
In the initial meeting of CSR report preparation, we invite members from all departments to exchange the issues related to 
current key stakeholders and their concerns. Upon reaching mutual understanding, the result is incorporated into a table that is 
regarded as an essential reference for the disclosures in the report. In the process of promoting CSR activities and information 
disclosure, we consult the opinion of the internal and external stakeholders, important relevant mechanisms include:

Result 1- Overall Employee Salary Increase with an Average of 3.54%
To satisfy the needs of our operations and expanding the business, we publicly recruit new 
employees and maintain an excellent workforce. To encourage high performance, we convened 
an unscheduled Board meeting to approve an overall salary increase in 2017. The average raise 
was 3.54% with a maximum of 5%, and was effective from January 1st, 2018. This was the biggest salary raise during our 12 years of privatization and we expect it to encourage employees 
in all aspects. We also expect better morale and higher performance, making CHT ‚ÄúThe Digital 
Economy Motivator and The Creative Industry Pilot.‚Äù
Result 2- The Digital Good Neighbors Program Provides Information Equality in the Communities
When implementing the ‚ÄúDigital Good Neighbors‚Äù program, and to make the best of limited resources, the CHT Foundation 
assessed the needs of the communities through regular interaction with the local populations.
Construction assessment: Applicants are required to complete a ‚ÄúDigital Good neighbor Application Form‚Äù to allow an
assessment to be made of the status of the community. After a review, meetings are held with the local key person and
on-site visits are also made. Internal discussions and further assessment of the feasibility of cooperation are held a fullunderstanding of the community and the matter has been reached.
Maintenance: Regular and random meetings are held with the key person to get feedback about the project. This
interaction allows us to better determine the needs of the community and allows a better and more even distribution of
available resources.
Implementation of the annual Foundation projects starts with a specific community need. During long-term interaction with ‚Äúthe good neighbors,‚Äù the community or tribe will also reciprocate to the Foundation. These interactions form a basis for 
modification of the project over the years in an effort to fully meet the local needs.
The annual procurement of CHT 
exceeds NT$ 40 billion. The items 
procured extend over a wide range, 
from broadband, mobile and fixed network devices to customer terminal 
products such as cell phones, tablets 
and laptops. At the annual CSR supplier social event in 2017, we 
announced that we had joined the 
‚ÄúCDP Supply Chain Project‚Äù and officially started the application of 
carbon management to our supply 
chain. We started gradually by using counseling to encourage suppliers to 
reduce carbon emission. In the long 
term, we will include carbon reduction performance into bidding documents 
to make it a requirement. This means 
that suppliers will only be able to place bids with CHT after completing a 
predetermined level of carbon emission 
reduction.

Climate Change RisksGlobal climate change has recently become rather severe. As a part of the global supply chain, CHT also faces the potential 
risks and pressure of energy conservation and carbon reduction. To ensure that we are able to respond to climate change 
issues in a timely fashion we comply strictly with all the environmental laws and regulations and maintain our leading position in 
the industry. We make sure that stakeholders have no reason to question our behavior or reputation, and confirm and identify 
the potential risks, and even opportunities, presented by climate change.
We have established an organized ‚ÄúCorporate 
Strategy and Environmental Sustainability‚Äù 
system with set goals and manage all 
environmental information with our own 
Environmental Sustainable Development and 
Management System (EARTH).Internal In our efforts to establish a green operation we 
have adopted the ‚Äúgreen products and services‚Äù 
philosophy. We use professional energy saving 
technology and services that help industrial 
companies easily manage energy conservation.External The core competence, technology and the business acumen of CHT will be the key to 
energy conservation and carbon reduction in the future, and also make it easier to cope 
with the coming mobile and cloud era. We will use internal and external strategy to realize 
our vision of environmental sustainability. Corresponding 
Strategy
The Potential Operational Risks Caused by Climate Change
The impact of the greenhouse effect, rising global temperatures and the aggravation of extreme climate, have caused some
areas of Taiwan to experience more severe typhoons and flooding while other parts face serious water shortage. Such crises
affect both industrial and domestic water use and effort has to be made to reduce the severity and avoid disastrous outcomes.Resources need to be made available for action in cases of natural disaster, and the equipment used must be properlymaintained and be available for further use after disasters and operational energy must also be easy to acquire.
We will establish greenhouse gas emission control and also allow carbon rights transactions in accordance with the ‚ÄúGreenhouse 
Emission Reduction and Management Act‚Äù of Taiwan. The CHT Internet and the operation of the generator room depend on a
huge amount of energy and the relative input has a direct effect on company finances.
Opportunities 
and ActionsWe have adopted the following strategies to cope with potential regulations and 
international environmental and climate initiatives in a timely manner:
Engagementwith the
stakeholdersWe focus closely on domestic and international law changes and communicate actively with 
the competent authorities and stakeholders.
Planning 
environmental 
sustainability schemeWe have amended our ‚ÄúFive-year Plan of Strategy and Goal for Environmental Sustainability Development,‚Äù which set in 2015, to target ‚Äúgreen corporation,‚Äù ‚Äúgreen sustainability‚Äù and ‚Äúgreen innovation‚Äù and have actively expanded our environmental actions. Furthermore, we 
have established a generator room disaster prevention and climate adaption plan to enhance 
our disaster response measures.
Import and 
develop 
renewable energyIn 2016 we established an ‚ÄúEnergy Office‚Äù targeting three main areas, solar energy,
wind energy, and LED. We cooperate with subcontractors in the generation of solar
energy and install solar panels on the roofs of rented spaces. After connection to thepower grid, we can provide the leasing contractor with power, and sell any excess backto Taipower. We have been assessing the possibility of participation in governmentbidding or investment in Taipower wind energy projects where we could put our telecom
expertise and experience of energy conservation and carbon reduction to good use.
We have installed photovoltaic panels on base stations in some of the remote mountain
areas to provide green power and reduce energy consumption and carbon emission.
In the event of mains power loss due to natural disaster, or breakdown at Taipower, thesolar facilities can provide emergency power for the base stations.
We have responded to the government‚Äôs renewable energy development efforts by the
purchase of 2 million kW of green electricity in 2015, 4 million in 2016, and 6 million in
2017, and took first place among all the companies in Taiwan.
Greenhouse 
gas emission 
managementWe carry out a greenhouse gas inventory and verification every year and publish all the relative information. We use our self-developed EARTH system, to control environmental 
resources and the effectiveness of energy conservation to increase efficiency in 
environmental management.We also joined the CDP Supply Chain Project in 2017. We gained an understanding of carbon 
emission data produced by the supply chain, how the inventory was calculated and what 
concrete action was necessary. This will be used as a basis for setting the carbon reduction goals for the supply chain in the future.
Developing 
green 
products and servicesIn addition to reducing the influence of our operations and product services on the environment, CHT also considers crises to be opportunities, at least with respect to products 
and service. We are reducing our carbon footprint through green innovative services 
including, video conferencing, the use of electronic billing, cloud products and several other technology innovations. We also make good use of our technological advantage in the field 
to improve current products and also use it to build intelligence into the city. The intelligent 
taxi sending system is an example which helps avoid empty journeys and reduces gas consumption. We will continue to develop more efficient ways to use energy and investigate 
low carbon emission solutions in collaboration with our customers.Corporate

The total greenhouse gas emission in 2017 was 832,987.46 t-CO 2e. This includes six GHGs of CO 2, CH 4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs 
and SF 6. As an integrated telecom carrier, most of the energy consumed by Chunghwa Telecom is purchased electricity, 
classed as Scope 2 gas emission and accounted for 96.29% of total gas emission. The source of Scope 1 gas emission is 
normally greenhouse gas from offices and accounted for 3.71% of total gas emission.
In 2013 Chunghwa Telecom started discussions about the carbon footprint associated with business travel by employees. 
Boundaries were set at ‚ÄúScope 3,‚Äù as specified by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), while 
emission was calculated based on mileage. Company Scope 3 emissions were 267.13 kg-CO 2e in 2017. Employee business 
travel emission was calculated based on two main forms of transportation: high-speed rail and air travel.Greenhouse Gas Emission Management

data are certified by SGS-Taiwan.
CHT places great emphasis on carbon management risk. In 2017 we combined the GHG emissions and relative operation and 
activities and carbon pricing management was used to do a pressure test in respect to risk management. This was important 
for compliance with the restrictions of future laws, such as the ‚ÄúGreenhouse Emission Reduction and Management Act,‚Äù and 
for responding to requests from stakeholders. Promotion of energy conservation and emission reduction, and the establishment of a renewable energy system are very important aspects of carbon management risk.
Internal carbon pricing as a negative environmental reduction value was used as a pressure test for scenario 2 ‚Äúfines for 
exceeding the total emission amount in the Greenhouse Emission Reduction and Management Act.‚Äù Although no total GHG 
emissions amount has yet been specified for the ICT industry in the Greenhouse Emission Reduction and Management Act, we voluntarily set the mid-long term carbon reduction goal as a basis for carbon price calculation. Evaluation of our internal energy 
conservation and carbon reduction project is carried out on the same basis. Internal Carbon Pricing
Note: 1. Sources from National Renewable Energy Certification Center
2. The green electricity add-on charge was NT$ 3.12/kW in 2017, and the price dropped to NT$ 1.06/kW during the
promotion. But the actual green electricity fee of using 1kW was NT$ 2.5+NT$ 1.06=NT$ 3.56.
3. Shadow price: It is the hypothetical cost of processing the GHG emissions. The risks and opportunities behind the
GHG emission are concretely quantified to be the reference for the project promoting or capital expense decision.
4. Scenario 1: 100% renewable energy use (such as green electricity).
5.Scenario 2: After the inclusion of a system of fines for exceeding a total GHG emission limit has been included in theGreenhouse Emission Reduction and Management Act an enterprise will be fined a maximum of NT$ 1500 per metric
ton for exceeding such specified limit.
6. The actual price in scenario 2 has been estimated in accordance with our voluntary emissions reduction goal for mid-
long term carbon management. 2017 was taken a base for a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emission from ourbuildings in 2023. The amount of GHG emission in 2017 was 832,987.46 t-CO
2e. If the 10% voluntary goal is not
reached, we estimate that emission of 83,298.75 t-CO 2e will be subject to a fine.

A focus on new markets for CHT Security
Chunghwa Telecom is the leading company in the telecom 
industry in Asia. We have cultivated a professional service 
for information security and use our technological expertise 
to provide clients with a complete professional service. We 
keep an eye on business opportunities brought about by the 
recent flood of global information security issues. In 2017 
we established CHT Security, a new subsidiary that we hope 
will soon become international. A combination of brand, 
research, development and service will allow us to expand 
operations into new markets and take advantage of business 
opportunities overseas with the help of CHT client relations 
management. We also expect CHT Security to become the 
leading domestic information security brand. We intend to 
expand into international information security operation and 
will also promote the development of an extensive chain of 
domestic cybersecurity resources in the country.

Forecasts show that in 2035 the revenue from 5G technology to companies in Taiwan will be NT$ 134 billion.. To gain an 
understanding of the potential business opportunities we have been monitoring five main aspects. We intend to help Taiwan 
keep up with the global trend through cross-field cooperation and assist in laying a firm foundation for Taiwan to participate in 
a promising global 5G economic environment.Leading the 5G Smart City
Innovative ICT Products and Services
We predict that 5G technology will urge the development of the IoT in the near future. Services of emerging new type such as AI, big data, drones, AR, VR, smart family and smart long-term care will bring about global economic growth. CHT is already 
actively investigating innovative products and applied ICT service development. We expect a substantial increase in the 
Company‚Äôs business power from expansion in the innovative field.
CHT leads in the development of an IoT application platform using innovative technology. Five main services have been 
combined, including Information Security, Big Data, the Cloud, AI and AR. There are now more than 500 medium to small companies using our platform. We have recruited a new talent force of 350 for the development of AI. There are 200 data 
scientists and 150 professionals engaged in AI research and six main AI application services have been developed:

has been established for research into new innovative services, core technology, 
and visionary applications. The Institute strives to explore convenient and 
useful services from the consumers‚Äô perspective. Solutions are formulated through intricate coordination, the purpose is to find ways to ‚Äúsimplify tasks for

Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories
Overview of Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories in 2017
hThere are more than 1,461 employees (nearly 6.50% of total
employees in CHT), and 95% are R&D personnel.
hThe funding for R&D funds totaled NT$ 3.9 billion, which was1.7% of the consolidated operating revenue.
hThe laboratories secured 190 new product/technical patents(167 domestic and 23 overseas) to a total of 1,839 (1,673
domestic and 166 overseas). 1,059 of the patents arecurrently in force (967 domestic and 92 overseas).The core business market of the telecom industry (fixed network, mobile service and voice service) has gradually reached saturation. This will have an impact on 
revenue in the mid-long term. There might be a reduction in revenue from voice 
services, overly high costs for basic telecom construction, or influence of the OTT suppliers. We predict that the overall output value of the telecom industry will 
continue to decline until 2020.
Our innovative strategies to cope with this situation include enhancing the current 
core business, active research into new product development, and more revenue 
from new and innovative ICT products and services.

Sponsoring the NASA Hackathon √ëSaving the Earth with Innovation
Chunghwa Telecom was the only sponsor of the 2017 ‚ÄúNASA Hackathon‚Äù in the telecom industry. We resourced an 
excellent broadband circuit, fiber-optic network, firewall and other information and communication software and hardware 
equipment, as well as all the necessary labor. We also provided the space, the NTU Sports Center, and used the safest 
and fastest Internet devices available to give the hackers a smooth, comfortable and uninterrupted Internet environment. The event went very well and many innovative technological applications were developed.
‚ÄúNASA Hackathon‚Äù is an international 48-hour long hack 
marathon that is held simultaneously worldwide. There were 
161 groups taking part in the 2017 Hackathon including one in Taiwan. NASA uses its resources and advantages in space 
development to collect high-quality global data. Hackers have 
access to these databases and put their heads together to find creative ways to manage water resources, respond to natural 
disasters, and many of the other challenges our planet is facing 
that can be addressed by IT applications in some way. CHT continues to use our excellent technological services to inspire 
the younger generation and make Taiwan more competitive in 
the information and communication industry.

iEN Water Resource Management 
CHT launched the iEN intelligent environmental service in 2008. We provide corporate clients with energy management 
technology that helps to reduce operational cost. In 2017, the iEN service embarked on water resource management to 
provide a full-scale water resource solution through information security and IoT technology.
Improved irrigation and water conservation management technology: An intelligent
decision-making system on the cloud, along with environmental monitoring equipment,
calculates and delivers the precise amount of water needed for the irrigation of crops toeffectively improve the efficiency of irrigation water conservation.
Smart operation and management technology at the Mudan Reservoir: The reservoir
monitoring system continuously collects information about the climate, water quality, the
valve settings, embankment and slope. The system also provides suggestions about waterdischarge based on rainfall over the catchment area and the reservoir water level. Stabilityof the water supply has increased and this allows much better management of resources.The system can be effectively used for three applications, the use of stored water, flood
control and reservoir safety.
Cloud Security and the Protection of Intellectual Property 
Counterfeits such as fake cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, tea and even soft drinks are all over the market. To prevent 
counterfeiting and the infringement of company property rights, we developed the ‚ÄúCHT Security Cloud‚Äù that provides 
a more complete security mechanism for the management layout of corporations. It not only secures brand value for a 
corporation but also effectively protects the rights of customers worldwide.
Up to 90% of the ‚ÄúCHT Security Cloud‚Äù users operate overseas. To provide a more effective security mechanism for 
overseas operation, ‚ÄúCHT Security Cloud‚Äù applies global channel management. The application also provides a multiple 
language interface that includes Traditional and Simplified Chinese, English and Japanese. This allows to act rapidly in cases of infringement and the appearance of counterfeit products and continue to focus attention on product research 
and development and other normal operations.

From Creation and Innovation to Startups
CHT has always encouraged creativity and innovation. Employees are encouraged to break new ground and turn their R&D 
creativity into real value, to drive industrial output and bring revenue to the Company. In 2017, we adopted a strategy of internal 
and external cooperation to encourage and promote new startups in the ICT industry in Taiwan. 
Supporting Startups 1 √ëLaunching the ‚Äúhi-accelerator project‚Äù
CHT and the Institute for the Information Industry signed the ‚Äúhi-accelerator project‚Äù MOU in 2017, and together began to 
cultivate innovative talent in the digital industry. The CHT cloud and the resources of the IoT applied platform combined 
with the innovation incubation power of the Institute for Information Industry accelerate the development of startups with 
innovative products, or services with good business value, further promoting the development of new innovative industry in the country.
Supporting Startups 2 √ëEstablishing a Venture Capital Fund with PChome
To support the development of early innovative startups in Taiwan and to incubate the ‚Äúunicorn companies,‚Äù the Strategic 
Committee of the BoD approved the establishment of an NT$ 400 million venture capital fund ‚ÄúCHT/PChome 1‚Äù with 
PChome Online Inc. The professional fields and resources of both parties are channeled towards investment and 
incubation and the fund supports Taiwan startups that create value and have their own core technologies.
Supporting Startups 3 √ëCHT ‚ÄúFirefly Project‚Äù
CHT and the Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund of Taiwan cooperated in the launch of the ‚ÄúFirefly 
Project Credit Guarantee‚Äù in December 2017. The ‚ÄúFirefly Project (counter guarantee for enterprise),‚Äù was also expanded 
by a donation of NT$ 50 million from CHT. The credit guarantee can allocate equal value and provide guarantees of up to 
20 times the financing amount (NT$ 2 billion) to support startup teams.
This initiative also encouraged project organization in the Bank of Taiwan, the Hua Nan Commercial Bank, the First 
Commercial Bank, the Taiwan Cooperative Bank, and the Taiwan Business Bank. There were 20 applications for financial 
support by the end of 2017 and financing amounted to NT$ 278 million.hWe provide an annual budget for creative teams of employees with a
maximum of NT$ 100 million for each case. This helps creativity and
supports the set-up of new companies.
hThe regulations for setting up companies for internal employees
was amended to include an innovation incubation incentive with a
maximum of 30-months salary.Innovation Incubation Team

The MOD Micro Movie Contest 
The Hami Software Development ContestCHT has cultivated the film and television industry for a long 
time. To support original digital content and foster excellent talents in Taiwan‚Äôs film industry, we held the ‚ÄúMOD Micro Movie and Gold Film Creation Contest‚Äù with awards to a total of NT$ 4.3 million in 2017 and received 324 entries, with 30 used 4K resolution to film. To give these short movies proper chance, we stream them on the MOD platform with HD high resolution, and provide them movies-in-theaters scale media exposure. We also held the first ‚ÄúFilm Festival of Awarded Pieces in the MOD Micro Movie and Gold Film Creation Contest.‚Äù The participating teams were able to exchange ideas and learn the latest trends in the audio-visual industry. 
We think the innovative technology and the younger generation need to be closely tied together, 
hence the ‚Äú2017 Hami Software Development Contest‚Äù was held. Many innovative software development teams were attracted to the contest and there were about 200 entries. The participants combined shared economy, IoT, 3D technology, AR and other approaches to develop creative applications. We provided these teams and suppliers with the opportunities and platform to implement creation and access to the market.
The champion  in the Innovative  division  of the 2017  Hami  Contest 
developed the ‚ÄúUSPACE Partner‚Äù application. This app uses the concept 
of shared vehicle parking from an economic viewpoint. Personal parking 
spaces can be shared and the application intelligent ground lock makes 
the parking space available for use by others when it is vacant. This can 
go some way to help with the shortage of parking space in cities.
The ‚ÄúUSPACE Partner‚Äù App was used in a demonstration at a shopping 
area on the Nanjing East Road under the auspices of the Mayor of 
Taipei City, Wen-Je Ko. The concept of shared parking space was 
also 
approved and promoted by several government and city 
departments. Everything needed to use the application was available 
on Google Play, and the downloads performed well. We may witness the 
creation of more world-class Apps through our contests in the future.

CHT has more than 22 thousand employees with an average age of more than 51-year-old. There will be more than 5 
thousand employees retiring over the next 5 years, and 50% of the employees will be eligible for retirement over the next 10 
years. Current senior management is included in this retirement tide. To cope with this problem CHT is actively cultivating 
new talents to ensure that knowledge is passed down to foster the talents of a new generation.
We not only face competition from the telecom industry, but also from an ever-changing information and communications 
industry. Future recruitment will be on a large-scale and will involve public recruiting exams. We will also use external 
recruiting methods aligned with each professional field. CHT talent will become an important growth power that will rise to a 
new level.

Disabled EmployeeChunghwa Telecom places great value on human rights and gender equality. In 2017, female staff accounted for 28.43% of 
the total, and 25.86% of the managers were women. To conform to the essence of the ‚Äúgender equality‚Äù in the Employment 
Act, the Company has outlined its sexual harassment prevention policy and established a ‚ÄúComplaint Investigation 
Committee‚Äù that specializes in the handling of employee complaints about work-related discrimination and improper behavior. The investigation committee has five members, three of whom are female. Our effective control has resulted in no 
incident of discrimination being reported in 2017.
CHT has done more than complying with the quota required by Article 38 of the Persons with Disabilities Rights Protection 
Act and have hired more than the required number. In 2017, the number of persons with disabilities hired was 3.71 times more than the statutory quota. (quota: 212; actual hire: 787). Where a department or institution employs a seriously disabled 
person in accordance with the act, the disabled person shall be calculated as two. We had 45 aboriginal employees on 
board in 2017. We fully respect their cultures and no violation of work or human rights was reported during the year.
Chunghwa Telecom is the only telecom carrier in Taiwan 
with an established union. We have signed a collective 
bargaining agreement with them which covers an extensive range of issues from redundancy, reward, 
discipline, promotion, to health and safety. This initiative 
not only complies with local laws and international human rights conventions, but is also a show of our commitment 
to the protection of employee interests. In addition to the 
union established by Chunghwa Telecom, employees have also assembled 11 other unions under the organization. 
In 2017, 99.86% of employees were union members. 
A director‚Äôs seat has also been reserved for a workers‚Äô representative, through whom workers can more freely 
express opinions.
We have open communication channels in place to ensure that employee needs or suggestions are heard. Any violation 
or misconduct in the workplace can be reported to the relevant department using the channels provided. There were 47 
complaints in 2017. Of these, 45 were disciplinary investigations and included such behavior as disrespect of the CHT 
system, principles, administrative management, violation of the employee code of conduct or other misconduct, and two were leak investigations. There were no human rights related cases in 2017.
We hold regular labor-management meetings to maintain contact between employees and the employer. There are nine 
representatives from each side, employer and employees. The chair is held by each side in turn. The Chairman and President of Chunghwa Telecom engage regularly with the  Chairman of the Union, Directors, and Supervisors in meetings, in person 
and by telephone. The Chairman of the Chunghwa Telecom Workers Union is entitled to participate in disciplinary review 
meetings, performance appraisals, and business report meetings to ensure that workers are kept up to date on Company news. In 2017, the Company held six nationwide labor-management meetings and one extraordinary meeting during which 
employees and the employer were able to reach consensus on many issues. Meetings for the discussion of particular 
matters can be convened, or if any change to work conditions is necessary. Eight such meetings were held in 2017.

The Only Taiwanese Carrier with an Established Union
Open Communication and Complaint ChannelsNote: Chunghwa Telecom complies with Article 16 of the group agreement about transfers. If there is a need to transfer a union 
member due to changes in the organization such as establishment, alteration, merger, and/or closure of a department, 
the Company will do so only if necessary and will respect the wishes of the member. In addition, all transfers must 
comply with the ‚ÄúFive Principles‚Äù of the Labor Standards Act.
Focusing on Employee Training and Development
Our fundamental business focus is ‚Äúcore competitiveness, 
professionalism, efficiency, and service‚Äù and we seek to 
develop innovative talent through a combination of internal 
and external training.
We have a comprehensive training system to assist 
employee development in all dimensions. The system 
starts with the incorporation of ‚Äúneeds analysis‚Äù and 
‚Äúin-depth planning‚Äù and is followed by performance assessment and review after the program ends. This 
systematic approach enhances professional skill and 
work efficiency, and helps the Company improve its coordination of human resources.
Human Resource Development Strategies
The Chunghwa Telecom Telecommunication Training Institute has devised human resource development strategies 
based on business focus and talent requirements between 2016 and 2018.
Digital Classroom
Chunghwa Telecom has introduced an online learning social network (the Digital Classroom) with an e-Learning 
approach quite unlike that of conventional classroom teaching. In this new learning social network one-way teaching 
has been replaced by an environment where users may share and transfer knowledge at a lower cost, and with a far better yield of good results. The broadband installation college, for example, is a platform where information such as 
technical documents, cases, video tutorials, and technical discussions can be exchanged and learned.
Online Broadcast
Online broadcasts can be used to teach topics related to specific work. They are delivered over the internal UC 
platform, and offer employees a fast and convenient way to gain knowledge and observe new trends. Online 
broadcasts transmit the experiences of experts to all employees without limit and boost business growth. The topics 
in 2017 included core business, ICT extended business, business in the new field and new knowledge of management 
and health care. There were 175 classes with 14,665 participants.
Results
hInformation security certification

Chunghwa Telecom has founded a ‚ÄúTelecommunication Training Institute‚Äù that specializes in training technical as well as 
managerial talent in the telecom field to gain more core competitive advantages. A ‚ÄúTalent Development Team‚Äù has also 
been established, with the President as convener, to conduct regular reviews of the planning and outcome of Company 
training effort. This is important to ensure that the training outcome is closely aligned with the operational policy to achieve a ‚Äúseamless combination of training and practice.‚Äù
To meet the needs of the organization, and the personal interest and even the personality traits of employees, the 
Telecommunication Training Institute provides a diversity of learning channels. These help employees develop new in-depth 
professional ability as well as a renewal of their management skills to bring about growth and proper career development. Employees can attend training at the Telecommunication Training Institute during regular hours, in the evening or on 
holidays. The institute can also dispatch tutors to relevant business units for organized training sessions. The institute offers 
eight learning channels: class teaching, distance education, digital learning, direct-broadcast courses, the Digital College, tutoring, external programs, and the digital library.
Orientation provides new recruits with a general understanding of Company vision, values and culture that helps them adapt 
to the new work environment and culture. ‚ÄúNew Recruit Counseling Guidelines for Chunghwa Telecom and Subordinate 
Institutions‚Äù were introduced in 2014 as well as a counselor system and digital learning tools to reduce the steepness of the new employee learning curve.
Chunghwa Telecom now applies ‚ÄúEmployees Performance Evaluation Guidelines‚Äù which are used in the evaluation of 
employee performance to develop the corporate culture where employees, customers, shareholders, and the Company will all be winners. Supervision will be provided for underperforming employees who will be guided until the appropriate 
improvement has been made and they are back on track.
Chunghwa Telecom conducts performance appraisal at three different levels: entry-level staff, entry and mid-level managers, 
and senior managers. Performance appraisal involves a series of face-to-face discussions between employees and line managers at the beginning of a year to set personal goals, and also at mid-year and years end to evaluate the degree of 
employee contribution to Company performance. During these sessions, managers also discuss career plans and suggest 
courses that are relevant to the future career of each employee. Performance bonuses and employee remuneration are tied to performance.
Recruitment and Development of the New-Generation Talents
According to an internal manpower survey, Chunghwa Telecom will encounter a wave of senior management 
retirements in five years. The following measures have been developed as a response to reduce disruption in the 
transfer of knowledge:
hHonghwa will be engaged where necessary to fill in shortfalls of frontline staff.
hWe will recruit additional talent for the R&D of IT, ICT and 4G technologies and support business growth. Recruitment
needs will be approved on a case-by-case basis.
hThe nurturing of the next-generation talent: The Company introduces new talent-training programs on a yearly basis.It provides employees with professional and diverse training options, and certifies the development of skill.
hEmerging businesses: new ICT technologies are being infused with knowledge from other fields. The Company willfocus on training professionals who can adapt and apply their knowledge across several different fields of expertise
such as cloud computing, big data, and product packaging, to actual practices.Dedicated Training Units

Fair Assessment Mechanism
Chunghwa Telecom is dedicated to providing employees with a diverse learning environment. In 2017, Chunghwa Telecom 
training expenses exceeded NT$ 500 million and employee training sessions totaled 974 thousand hours. We encourage 
employees to commit themselves to long-term learning and we offer education subsidies as much as NT$ 30,000 per 
semester. Subsidies were given to 440 employees in 2017 and the Company compensation amounted to NT$ 7.01 million.
Since 2011, we have been engaging outside agencies to carry out annual ‚ÄúChunghwa Telecom Happiness at Work Survey‚Äù 
in an anonymous manner. This helps us to understand how employees feel about their work and working status. The 
findings are used as a reference for the improvement of management. The survey topics include individual opinions about 
the working environment, welfare and corporate transformation. By listening to the opinions of the employee, we get to 
understand their feelings and expectations. We will continue these surveys and respond to employee opinions. The 2017 
‚ÄúHappiness at Work Survey‚Äù graded at an average of 80.56 points out of 100.2015 2016 2017

Health and Safety Management
Chunghwa Telecom was the first telecom service provider in Taiwan to adopt the OHSAS 18000 Occupational Health 
and Safety Management System. By the end of 2017, 27 Company business groups and branches had already passed 
international certification. We use careful systematic management to ensure the health and safety of our employees. In 
addition to identifying hazards and assessing the risks associated with telecom operations, the Company has also applied 
restrictions and enhanced risk control for high-risk tasks, while taking effective precautions to reduce occupational hazards. 
In addition to complying with safety and health regulations, the Company has also been active in the improvement of the 
current work environment and takes regular action with regard to safety and health facilities and measures.
We take part in all government initiatives and actively promote a healthy workplace. Nine divisions within the Company have 
received awards under the ‚ÄúNational Workplace Safety and Health Campaign‚Äù organized by the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration, Ministry of Labor. The Taipei Mobile Business Group location received the ‚ÄúHealth Model Award‚Äù from 
the Ministry of Health and Welfare.
We have a dedicated ‚ÄúLabor Safety and Health Department‚Äù responsible for the planning and implementation of labor safety 
and health matters. A ‚ÄúLabor Safety and Health Committee‚Äù has also been created that meets every quarter to deliberate, 
coordinate and make suggestions on labor safety and health issues.
The ‚ÄúLabor Safety and Health Committee‚Äù has 27 members, including representatives from each department unit and the 
labor union as well as several technicians and medical personnel. Among these, ten members are from the labor union, 
accounting for 37%. Four meetings were held in 2017 and eleven proposals were presented by the labor representatives. 
Four of these were related to the improvement of safety and health facilities, five to the refinement of safety and health 
management, and two concerned food hygiene. All proposals have been solved after deliberation.The Dedicated Occupational Safety and Health Management Unit

To better provide immediate medical assistance and attend 
to worker health, we engaged 20 full-time nurses and 
contracted 22 physicians in 2017 for this specific purpose. 
They were assigned to locations at Xinyi, Aiguo, the Da‚Äôan Industrial Park, New Taipei City, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, 
Central Taiwan, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung.
The Company has deployed six i-med Systems at local 
customer centers for employees involved in high-risk 
activities. Blood pressure is measured and employees 
are given careful health checks before they engage in any high-risk work. This reduces the risk of accidents in high-
risk situations.Full-Time Physicians and Nurses to Improve Employee‚Äôs Health Management
Health Promotions for Senior Employees
A significant portion of Chunghwa Telecom employees are 50 years old or 
older. This is one reason why we consider health care an important issue, 
especially for senior employees. In 2017, we launched a series of health 
checkups and health management programs for senior employees. In addition to helping them develop physical capabilities, it was also part of our intention 
to create support systems among friends.
Health checkups: The Company provided checkup services
specifically targeted at senior employees, including carotid duplex and
echocardiography for the risk of ischemic stroke, coronary artery narrowingand incomplete heart valve closure, as well as fundus photography forchecking macular degeneration, retinal vessels and glaucoma.
Health seminars: We invited a dietitian from the Taiwan Adventist Hospital
to talk about ‚Äúeating for good eyesight‚Äù to let the employees learn how
to choose the right food and supplements for maintaining good eyesight.We also invited the instructor from the health and exercise associationto demonstrate muscle strength and stretching exercises in the office,emphasizing the importance of health plans toward the maintenance of
body function.
Others: As a countermeasure to influenza outbreaks, Chunghwa Telecom
subsidized influenza vaccinations for 1,745 employees.
National Fitness Program
The Sports Administration of the Ministry of Education, commissioned 
Shung Ho Hospital to organize a National Fitness Program in 2017, and 149 
employees from headquarters signed up to learn more about fitness. The 
program included many tests such as body measurements (height, weight, waist-hip ratio); muscle strength and endurance (sit-ups in a minute), flexibility 
(forward flexion) and cardio-respiratory fitness (stair-climbing over 3 minutes) 
designed to help employees learn more about their health and absorb new knowledge about sports.

The Chunghwa Telecom ‚ÄúWork Accident Guidelines‚Äù contain detailed procedures for assessing occupational illness. 
Employees suspected of having become ill as a result of their occupation are assisted with an application for verification 
at the local municipal/county/city authority in accordance with the ‚ÄúProtecting Workers from Occupational Accidents Act.‚Äù 
We manage risks at the source, by making sure that construction risks are under control from the early design stages of a 
project. The line construction management system has been amended with respect to highlighting high-risk operations as 
well as risk assessment information to ensure operators are able to identify potential risk in advance.
All high-risk operations are subject to approval by the ICT. Workers are also required to take site pictures with handheld 
devices and upload them to the monitoring system so that precautionary measures can be identified and taken to prevent 
such accidents as falls, oxygen deprivation, etc. To promote employee awareness and safety and health skills, we organized 
138 training sessions in 2017 and there were 6,257 enrollments.
The Company encountered 49 cases of occupational hazard in 2017; 31 of which had occurred during work (including 20 
traffic accidents) 18 accidents occurred during commuting. The top three accidents were a work-related injury, a traffic 
accident while commuting, and a fall. To raise employee awareness of traffic safety and reduce the occurrence of traffic 
accidents, we organized the ‚ÄúPrevention and Handling of Traffic Accident‚Äù training. The instruction was given by members of 
the New Taipei City Traffic Accident Investigation Committee. Employees are constantly being reminded, at the Occupational 
Safety and Health Committee meetings, work safety meetings and training sessions to exercise greater attention to personal 
safety and safe driving.

After a study of the 2017 risk analysis and inspection of the human rights value chain, we have concluded the following 
material issues, including:Human Rights Material Risk Issues
          Local Human Rights
To fulfill the concept of anti-forced labor and appropriate working environment, we required the bidders to sign a ‚ÄúDeclaration 
of Minerals as Conflict-Free‚Äù at the procurement phase. We evaluated the suppliers to determine if raw materials derived 
from human rights high-risk areas like the R√©publique D√©mocratique du Congo were being utilized to avoid further 
infringement of the basic human rights of local residents in places where we provided information communication services 
and products. We depend on demand and require the suppliers to provide certification of material resources, third-party 
verification or accepted auditing to confirm no related violations.
We also required that all suppliers complied with the ‚ÄúRestriction of Hazardous Substances Directive‚Äù (RoHS) to prevent 
hazardous substances from the source endangering local employees, the environment or customers.
          Employment Human Rights
We use the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSAS 18000) to avoid potential risk and have 
systematically fulfilled employee safety and health management. In addition to compliance with the safety and health-related 
regulations toward high-risk tasks, we have also enhanced risk control. We continue to improve the working environment 
and take action in regards to safety and health facilities and measures to actively ensure employee protection.
Sometimes customer service personnel encounter irrational requests and even personal abuse from customers in the 
course of the provision of our services. We established an SOP for employee response and took action at a critical level 
in certain circumstances. Legal assistance can be authorized to provide assistance in the event of serious offenses and to 
prevent illegal practices. CHT adopted the ISO 10002 quality management system in 2001 and have a certified and flawless 
customer service procedure and management mechanism in place. In addition, we regularly offer pertinent educational 
training courses in customer relations, the management of emotional stress, and occupational hazard prevention. While 
building up professional capability, we positively avoid pressure on customer service personnel to avoid mental and physical 
health problems. Customer service personnel were given five training courses during the year and training hours totaled 588 
hours in 2017.
          Customer Human Rights
Due to the nature of our industry, in addition to establishing information security management applicable to the enterprise 
operation, we also implement measures to safeguard our customer‚Äôs personal information.
To improve our operational management we implemented information security in compliance with the international standards 
ISO 27001 and BS 10012 and carried out regular supplier auditing and supervision through employees or a third party. We 
also carried out vulnerability scanning and the testing of all equipment and software from outside suppliers to ensure there 
were no back-doors or malware.
We take customer privacy protection very seriously and in addition to acquiring the customer‚Äôs agreement before the 
collection of any personal information, we established the internal ‚ÄúSecurity and Safety Principle of Customer Information 
Re-use.‚Äù This means that personnel need to make formal application and receive managerial approval before being granted 
the authority that allows access to the advanced information security system. The system itself not only supervises and 
records employee operations but also only reveals the number of customers under certain conditions without touching 
detailed information. Related information also complies with the principle of ‚Äúno names are revealed‚Äù to prevent the 
downloading of personal information and avoid leakage or disclosure.
          Information Equality
Chunghwa Telecom is creating a free and open information sharing 
environment without technological boundaries that can be shared by 
everyone. Such a system inherits culture, extends education, promotes 
industry, and upgrading art with a connection to the universe of the Internet. 
Digital technology can be beneficial to everyone irrespective of age, social 
standing, wealth, geographical location, or education. We base our approach 
on the characteristics of the ICT industry and the spirit of ‚Äúvalue is where the 
responsibility lies,‚Äù in our work with the communities in Taiwan. Our main 
objective is to ‚Äúminimize the digital divide and create digital opportunities,‚Äù 
Chunghwa Telecom watches the trends of this digital divide and offers 
solutions that facilitate social innovation and digital inclusion. We spare no 
effort in the advocacy of the ‚Äúcorporate volunteer,‚Äù participate in community 
services, and proactively assist communities in the creation of digital

offer, we look at the matter from the point of view of the consumer. We provide consumers with the most comprehensive, 
high quality and efficient services putting a wide and diverse range of service channels at their disposal. By the end of 
December 2017, we had 465 direct physical channel service stores, and 285 franchised stores, a total of 750 service outlets 
that provide convenient service for all consumers in cities, or even in remote areas in Taiwan.

services to increase customer service capacity.
We provide a handbook about products and services for consumers that details product characteristics and applications, 
consider the negative aspect of overuse, and has friendly reminders provided while marketing. In addition, Chunghwa 
Telecom has set up the ‚ÄúChannel Sale Support Items Management Guideline‚Äù and ‚ÄúChannel Sales Support Items 
Management Implementation Procedures‚Äù to make the display of sales support items and operation management consistent 
throughout all the service and business locations. This ensures a positive service environment for consumers. These are 
vital for maintaining a superior and professional image as well as the service quality at Chunghwa Telecom. No violations of

MOD: The Biggest Audio-Visual Platform to Watch Multimedia on Demand
‚ÄúMy TV my demand, I buy what I want to watch!‚Äù Chunghwa Telecom MOD is the biggest audio-visual 
platform in Taiwan and it guided the development of national digital television in 2017. The service 
promoted a new profit distribution system with channels that encourage the introduction of high-
quality video. Audience subscription is attracted by multiple contents and the formation of positive circulation of the channels, platform and the consumer. This was the most successful revolution in the 
audio-visual industry.

Thank You for Your Professional and Warming Service
Ms. Chen has called to inform that she had not received her bill and customer 
service specialist Ms. Fan immediately found and resent the bill. Ms. Chen also 
said that she has received a marketing promotion call for broadband Internet 
contract renewal, but considered that renewal through the customer service 
hotline was easier and there was no need for concern about fraud. After that, 
customer service specialist Ms. Fan described and introduced the suitable plan 
content in detail. Finally, Ms. Chen decided to renew the broadband Internet to 
100M and praised Ms. Fan‚Äôs professional service.
The line was disconnected for some reason during the call and Ms. Fan 
immediately called the customer back. In addition to telling Ms. Chen that the 
broadband Internet had been completely upgraded, she told Ms. Chen about 
related issues. Because of the thoughtful service, Ms. Chen asked to talk to 
the customer services manager, saying: ‚ÄúMs. Fan had a great and professional 
service attitude. I want to tell you that I am in a good mood this morning thanks 
to her. She is a modest and great person and I really appreciated the service. 
Chunghwa Telecom manager has good guidance. Thank you so much.‚Äù
Starting from the greeting ‚ÄúGood morning, Ms. Chen,‚Äù customer service specialist Ms. Fan made a good impression 
on the customer and quickly provided professional assistance and the appropriate suggestions to resolve the 
customer‚Äôs problem, adding a new sale into the bargain.
In 2011, Chunghwa Telecom became the telecom carrier to have all its centers certified for the ‚ÄúISO 10002:2004 
Customer Complaint Management System.‚Äù The Company views customer complaints as opportunities to make ongoing 
improvements. The resolution of customer complaints and dissatisfaction is rule-based and they must be settled within 3 
working days. This approach ensures the continuous improvement of service quality.
In addition to the customer service hotline, consumers may also use the corporate website or Representative Line 
authorized by the President (02-23446789) to raise complaints directly to the assistance of the senior executive.
We conduct a broad variety of satisfaction surveys to identify the issues of most concern to consumers and their 
expectations. We use these findings to guide future improvements. After each survey, the opinions and suggestions are 
conveyed promptly to product or business personnel (including Risk Management and the Public Relations Departments) 
using the consumer feedback system. Furthermore, consumers‚Äô opinions are brought to the attention of the senior manager 
of the product and customer service departments for discussion at monthly meetings to ensure that the consumers‚Äô 
expectations receive proper consideration.
Regarding the IPA (Importance-Performance Analysis) items belonging to the fourth quadrant (high importance and low 
performance) after a review of the results of the annual satisfaction survey, we will request that the relevant functional units 
conduct further analysis and propose measures for concrete improvement every year. There will also be a follow-up in the 
next quarter to keep track of the progress of any corrective action found necessary.KPIs for the Customer Service Hotline

reached more than 4.6 (on a 5-point scale). However, we 
are not satisfied with this and will continue to optimize 
the customer service process and promote customer 
service quality!‚Äù We will use big data to analyze 
consumer behavior from past accumulated data to 
learn about the actual needs of customers and optimize 
customer experience.

Total Coverage of Free 4G Telecommunication in Remote Areas
Chunghwa Telecom accelerated the construction of mobile networks in 2017. In addition to having the greatest number 
of 4G base stations in the industry, achieved by a growth of 40%, we also provide the only four carrier aggregation (4CA) 
service all across Taiwan High-Speed Rail and in the 20 most popular commercial areas in the country. Chunghwa Telecom 
provides the most comprehensive service with wide bandwidth and all their customers enjoy the smoothest Internet operation available. 
To ensure the equal sharing of information, in addition to a positive strengthening of mobile Internet quality in populous 
metropolitan areas, we have paid more attention to signal coverage in remote areas. We have achieved 100% total 4G 
coverage in all the towns, and continue to go deep into the mountain areas and off-shore islands. Of the 747 remote villages 
and areas in Taiwan 736 have 4G LTE coverage.
We have the widest bandwidth at 180 MHz and will continue to use our bandwidth advantage to enhance Internet speed, 
expand network capacity and provide the most reliable mobile service. To support the ‚ÄúDIGI+ Program‚Äù initiative introduced 
by the Executive Yuan, we expect to increase the 1Gbps network coverage to 72% by 2020.
We have also supported the government initiative for the promotion of free wireless 
Internet services on a nationwide scale. By making a reasonable Wi-Fi rental 
package available, as well as a robust user authentication platform and a nationwide maintenance/monitoring system, we have helped the government deploy free Wi-
Fi hotspots all over the country. By the end of 2017, we had installed more than 
59,000 public Wi-Fi hotspots, giving users access to stable high-bandwidth in a densely covered Wi-Fi service.
Our contributions to social events in 2017 included working with local county and 
city governments to provide Wi-Fi hotspots and enable Internet access at festive 
gatherings and international sports events. We installed 2,200 hotspots for the 2017 Universiade, 107 hotspots for New Year‚Äôs Eve festivity, 180 for the Lantern Festival 
and about 147 for other activities. The company participated in 28 festive occasions 
and spent more than NT$ 2 million.

ensures that residents in remote locations can stay connected even when main power has been disrupted by a natural 
disaster.
In efforts to minimize the impact of disasters by prompt messaging, the Chunghwa Telecom self-developed ‚ÄúEmergency Response 
SMS System‚Äù sent out more than 330,000 SMS alerts in 2017. The role of this service in disaster prevention and notification was outstanding. In addition, a ‚ÄúPublic Warning System‚Äù (PWS) has been established to support the national policy of emergency message 
dissemination about typhoons, earthquakes, thunderstorms, landslides, roadblocks, reservoir flooding or an outbreak of disease, fast 
and correctly to specific regions simultaneously. As long as a mobile phone is open to the PWS function all our 3G and 4G customers will receive messages about disasters. During 2017, the PWS transmitted more than 14,000 alert messages.
In March 2017, we assisted the New Taipei City Government in organizing the ‚ÄúAll-out Defense Mobilization Drill,‚Äù the Taoyuan City 
Government, Taiwan Power Company and CPC Corporation in organizing the ‚ÄúExecutive Yuan Disaster Prevention and Rescue Practice Evaluation and Field Drill‚Äù and also participated in the ‚ÄúNuclear Safety Drill No. 23‚Äù at Taiwan Power Company‚Äôs 2rd nuclear 
plant in September. We messaged reports to the residents in specific regions through the ‚ÄúEmergency Response SMS System.‚Äù In October, we assisted the Changhua County Government and Directorate General of Highways, MOTC in organizing the first ‚ÄúBaguashan 
Tunnel Both-way Enclosed Disaster Prevention Drill‚Äù within 12 years. We also helped the government units and the public to increase 
the awareness of the need for action in the case of a disaster and also the need for emergency response capabilities.Enhanced Disaster Response and Communication Coverage
Disaster Reporting and Upgraded SafetyResponse 
Measures
We conduct annual emergency drills for a wide number of different events, from the coordination of 
network resources and equipment to emergency repairs. Our base stations have been deployed in a 
diversified manner and are covered by robust backup plans so that failure of circuitry, power or equipment 
at any base station will not disrupt the operation of other nearby base stations.
Occurrenceof Disaster
If communication is severely disrupted in the unfortunate event of a natural disaster, we take contingency 
measures, that depends on the actual circumstances, to maintain communication between the disaster 
locations and the outside world. These can include microwave radio, satellite transmission, portable base 
stations, etc.
SpecialCases
Areas that are enclosed and accessible only through one road, such as on the Suhua Highway, are 
covered using multiple base stations so that even if one station were to be damaged in a natural disaster, 
other paired stations may still function to maintain contact with the area by phone.Corporate

According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and related scientific research, exposure to base stations and 
Wi-Fi signals does not affect human health. For this issue, Chunghwa Telecom ensures strict compliance with the authority‚Äôs 
safety standards when constructing telecom infrastructure. The Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of all mobile communication 
products we purchased have complied with the restrictions of the National Communications Commission (NCC).
Given the scarcity of suitable base station locations and the need to assure consumer rights to quality communication, we 
will strive to comply with regulations by taking the approved precautions at all stages of installation. In 2017, Chunghwa Telecom incurred NT$ 3.5 million in fines and administrative penalties on seven counts of violations associated with base 
stations. These violations occurred as we sought to address consumer demand for ‚Äúgood reception‚Äù and concern towards 
‚Äúnegative health impacts from base stations.‚Äù

Chunghwa Telecom has set themselves a goal to become a sustainable ‚ÄúGreen enterprise,‚Äù and has made environmental 
issues an incorporated part of business operation and management. We hope to play a more proactive role in issues such as 
energy and climate change. By improving energy efficiency and exploring environmental friendly products and services, we are 
confident of our potential to inspire a new generation of low-carbon industries.
We developed the Environment ARtificer THeurgy (EARTH) system in 2008 to manage resources and protect the environment 
more efficiently as well as to reduce spending on energy consumption.
EARTH system features include
Chunghwa Telecom Hostels provide accommodation 
for employee business or leisure travel. In response to environmental protection and personal hygiene, the hostels 
do not provide disposable, or consumable items or towels. 
They also take energy-saving measures such as solar water heating, air conditioning using heat pumps and LED lighting. 
Nineteen hostels had been certified as Environmental 
Friendly Accommodation by 2017.Environment ARtificer THeurgy (EARTH)

Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs e-invoice value-added center service allows corporate customers to store 
invoices permanently as digital files on a cloud server for ease of access. Alternative printed 
copies of invoices have been downsized to no larger than 5 x 8 cm, and only one sheet of paper 
is printed regardless of the number of items purchased. As a result, the amount of pulp used has been reduced to somewhere between 1/3 and 1/4, which has effectively reduced business costs.
For example, a business that prints 3.8 million digital invoice pages per month would be able to 
save 4,600 trees in a year, and given the average carbon absorption capacity of 10-20 kg per 
tree, the solution could reduce carbon emission by 90,000 kg a year. In 2017, 676 Chunghwa 
Telecom customers were using the digital invoice system, which generated annual revenue of NT$ 5.7 million.E-Invoice Value-Added Center Service

In 2017, Chunghwa Telecom received a tender for a new solar power plant to be established in the Changhua Coastal area 
of the Taiwan Power Company currently the largest scale of Solar Power Plant in Taiwan, at 140 hectares. It is expected to 
be finished in 2019 and it is estimated that the facility will increase our revenue by about NT$ 5.8 billion.
The solar panel landscape environment designed for the new solar power plant uses images of local protected animals, 
the Chinese white dolphin (Sousa chinensis) and the little tern (Sternula albifrons) and has used the concept of green 
building for the substation design. It will become one of the most magnificent sights in the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park and the best nationwide location for energy education.
We established a smart energy office in 2015 to fully develop the green power market for solar power, wind power and 
marsh gas power. As of September, 2017, we had 373 sites operating which generated 103 MW of electricity. We have applied ICT and IoT to include the solar power plant systems in the cloud intelligent platform iEN to monitor power 
generation and to send alerts to maintenance staff about any malfunctions that might occur.Snatching Green Energy Business and the Largest Scale Solar Power Plant Tender
Driven by care towards environmental sustainability, Chunghwa Telecom actively supports the government‚Äôs Green Power

Water usage at Chunghwa Telecom is mostly domestic. Apart from bathroom use, air conditioner cooling accounts for another 
major water use. Given the ongoing increase in business activities and manpower, there is limited room for water reduction 
besides the recovery of rainwater and cooling water.
We benchmarked the 2012 water usage as the standard, and now control the annual growth of water usage to no more than 
2%. In addition to a new water leakage detection feature in products, we have also included Company water consumption in 
the EARTH system. Centralized water bill payment is done through the EARTH ‚Äúwater bill management‚Äù function to reduce the printing of water bills. Managers can use the system to search, generate trend charts and report forms, and provide exception 
reports to avoid mistakes in billing and meter reading. Managers can also review the situation of water usage according to 
trend charts and reports, reduce expenses in water, and improve the efficiency of management.
The management and analysis information interface can be used to promote water conservation measures and set concrete 
management goals. We also promote water-saving measures to increase efficiency in water use:
To enhance the effectiveness of water recycling and reuse, we have set up raft foundation water collection systems 
underground to collect clean rainwater from rooftops and the ground surface. We have also initiated the recycling of cooled 
and condensed water from office air-conditioners and promoted a recycling and reuse plan for rainwater, bathwater and air 
conditioner water. The recycled water is reused for watering plants and cleaning sidewalks.Water Resource Management

and control energy efficiency, as well as to conduct systematic 
management of recyclables and waste treatment.
We contracted a professional waste treatment company to 
transport our daily waste to landfills or incinerators for disposal. 
Recyclable waste is handled by a contracted cleaning company 
that is responsible for classification, treatment and proper 
disposal.Waste Management
265,455 254,198 180,764Scrapped lead-acid batteries are recyclable industrial waste regulated by the EPA. Business organizations are responsible for 
the reduction of pollution, disposal of toxic substances and simple waste disposal. All recycling and disposal operations are 
outsourced by joint contract based on the public auction. The contractor must be a qualified service provider listed on the 
website of the Recycling Fund Management Board of the EPA to ensure legitimate management and disposal and to reduce 
environmental impact.
Scrapped lead-acid batteries from each business unit are auctioned on site, and the ‚ÄúAnnouncement and Delivery Slip for 
Removal and Disposal of Waste Lead-Acid Batteries‚Äù is retained for reference. The gradual rise in raw material prices has 
also caused the recycling and reuse value of scrapped lead-acid batteries to increase. A total of 32,264 lead-acid batteries 
with a total weight of 2,065,674 kg were scrapped and sold for NT$ 38,496 thousand in 2017. In fulfilling our responsibility for

4G The Green Supply ChainChunghwa Telecom is a highly-localized telecom carrier, a generous contributor to community development, and one of the 
most important partners to other telecom carriers around the world. As technologies progressed and improved, we began 
some operations that were outside the conventional telecom boundaries, ‚Äúcorporate social responsibility‚Äù concepts were 
introduced into products and services research, development, applications, and into the Company management strategies.
The responsibilities and mission of Chunghwa Telecom, as the leader of the telecom industry are ‚ÄúGreen of ICT and Green by 
ICT.‚Äù This implies facilitation of the greenness of the ICT industry (Green of ICT) and overall greenness of society through ICT (Green by ICT).
The trend towards greenness in enterprises is propelled by two forces: ‚Äúmarket and non-market.‚Äù Non-market forces come 
from government regulations, the market forces from supplier management. To co-exist with the environment, businesses must 
implement ‚Äúgreen practices‚Äù throughout the entire supply chain. Chunghwa Telecom has been implementing such measures 
since 2008, and at the end of 2016, we introduced our proprietary ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù product label and invited all our suppliers to apply for certification. This made it possible to ensure the use of energy-saving, or green energy products throughout the supply 
chain, from raw materials and production to packaging. In 2017, we were first in the industry to join the ‚ÄúCDP Supply Chain 
Project‚Äù  to strengthen, integrate and analyze greenhouse gas emission by suppliers using the CDP platform to ensure carbon management information transparency in the Chunghwa Telecom supply chain.
Future green supply chains will entail more than just supplier commitment to environmental protection and the life cycle of 
green products. Chunghwa Telecom will continue to explore value-added applications of ICT, and introduce robust systems to facilitate better coordination and management, as well as complete monitoring of the supply chain.In addition to developing products that are friendly to the environment, we have been promoting Green Stores and were the 
first telecom carrier in Taiwan to fully turn service centers into Green Stores. Customers are encouraged to purchase green products from our ‚ÄúChunghwa Telecom Green Stores.‚Äù In 2017, green revenue was NT$ 7,795.2 million, which was 3.5% of the 
total revenue. 
We have been promoting the use of electronic billing since 2001 to conserve energy, and reduce carbon emission by 
eliminating the use of paper for bills. In 2017, we offered the ‚Äúpaperless receipt service‚Äù to satisfy customer need and also 
contribute to a reduction of global warming. The service saved 568 million sheets of paper and an estimated 51,703 trees, it 
had also reduced carbon emission by 10,237 metric tons by the end of 2017.Green Revenue

printed A4 paper and an envelope. Total amount of paper saved: 18,957,696 records * 12 months * 2.5 = 568,730 thousand sheets of paper.
3. One sheet of A4 paper generates 18 grams of
CO

568,730,000 sheets * 18 grams CO 2 = 10,237 
metric tons CO 2. 
5G Green Procurement
Chunghwa Telecom supports government policy and prepares annual budgets for the purchase of green products that are 
either environmental-certified (less polluting, recyclable, resource-saving or green building material) or self-declared to be of less 
environmental impact throughout the product lifecycle (from raw material to disposal). The Company also actively participates in 
green procurement programs and activities to inspire green purchases amongst others in the industry and the public.
Our goals and policies concerning green procurement 
have been explained in detail in the five-year plan mentioned above. We hope to maintain green purchases 
at more than 5% of the total purchases per year over 
the mid-term, and increase this percentage to more than 50% over the long term.2015 2016 2017

Sustainable Supply Chain
Every year Chunghwa Telecom purchases the software, hardware and services necessary for operations from international and 
domestic suppliers. This includes networking and data equipment, cables, marketing, design and waste disposal services. 
Our enormous purchasing power gives us a profound influence over the supply chain, hence the responsibility to guide our 
suppliers in the fulfillment of their CSR. This is achieved by implementing conduct that complies with the international ESG supply chain regulations to guide the ICT industry towards sustainability. We were the first telecom enterprise in Taiwan to join 
the CDP Supply Chain Project in 2017 when the industry was confronted by the critical issues of global climate change and its 
effect on corporate development. We strive to establish a better connection to the world on our path towards the development of sustainability. 
The Chunghwa Telecom suppliers fall into three categories: 
property, labor and engineering. Apart from professional network communications equipment which is mainly 
purchased overseas, we buy as much from local suppliers 
as possible to promote local economic development. The domestic procurement percentage was 56% in 2017.
We promote corporate social responsibilities on two levels. (1) For new suppliers just starting to learn about corporate social responsibilities, we offer encouragement, 
education and support during their development of the 
proper awareness for CSR. (2) For established suppliers who are fully aware of the need for CSR, we conduct third-
party audits, issue online CSR questionnaires, organize 
conferences, and launch sustainability campaigns as means to engage them in a winning relationship.ESG Management Supply Chain Strategy

Safety and health on-site 
inspectionsThe Northern and Southern Taiwan Business Groups and the Mobile Business Group all 
have health and safety officers assigned to inspect suppliers on-site at least three times a

Rewards top-
performing 
suppliersTo reward top-performing suppliers, Chunghwa Telecom conducted a trial in southern Taiwan, offering 
qualified suppliers the privilege of ‚Äútender bond waiver when submitting tenders, as well as a reduction of 
the performance bond to 5% of the value of the contract won.‚Äù This was an attempt to exert influence as an 
industry leader and bring more attention to corporate social responsibility.
Training of 
professional 
skillsOur Telecommunication Training Institute has been providing suppliers with relevant training and certification 
courses to satisfy their requirements. Some of the popular courses include: cabling contractor certification, 
telecom line construction quality assurance certification, and fiber optic contractor training. In 2017, the 
institute organized 57 classes and trained 1,483 workers; 912 of whom had obtained certification.We published ‚ÄúCode of Corporate Social Responsibility for Suppliers of Chunghwa Telecom Co Ltd‚Äù in 2011, and it clearly 
outlines the Company‚Äôs expectations in terms of ‚Äúbusiness, ethics, labor, environment, safety, and health.‚Äù The guidelines apply 
to all suppliers that provide products or services to Chunghwa Telecom or its subsidiaries or joint ventures, and extend to other 
participants of the supply chain to which the supplier is directly or indirectly related. We hope that suppliers will commit to our 
values and take more proactive steps towards maintaining a sustainable business relationship.
Chunghwa Telecom shares resources with suppliers to help them develop R&D capabilities and future technologies. We also 
devote ourselves to the creation of a friendly and innovative environment. We engage suppliers in R&D projects, reward their 
contributions, and make arrangements for the transfer of acquired technology and licenses fairly. Regarding hardware, we 
continue to support the development of telecom facilities and testing environments; in terms of software, we utilize open 
platforms to share our benefits with suppliers.Note: Due to a slight increase (0.2%) in the recovery rate of the 2017 online questionnaire compared to that of 2016, we did 
not reach the target (88%).Corporate

To promote awareness of CSR and ESG management in supply chain partners, SGS-Taiwan has been subject to tier 1 supplier 
on-site audits since 2010 in accordance with ESG supply chain principles drafted by Chunghwa Telecom. Their existing 
occupational safety and health provisions resulted in an on-site audit rate of 84.65% in 2017. We have undertaken to insist on 
an audit rate of 100% in our critical tier 1 supplier ESG on-site audits so that all our supply chain partners will be in compliance with ESG management requirements before 2023.
After ‚ÄúThe Paris Agreement‚Äù took effect, we entered an age of low-carbon economy. Chunghwa Telecom is a carrier in the 
information and communications industry, and this is a crucial issue of great urgency. We need to understand and respond to 
the impact of climate change and plan appropriate response strategies and actions at once.
We made Climate Change the main theme of our supplier CSR Interchange Meeting in 2017. We invited a CDP representative 
and people from advanced domestic enterprises with forward-looking carbon management to share how to identify risks and 
opportunities brought by the climate change issue. We also formally activated and announced our membership of the ‚ÄúCarbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Project.‚Äù We are promoting an understanding of climate change among our suppliers 
and will make every effort to increase their efficiency in carbon management. CHT is putting an encouragement mechanism in 
place that will help suppliers with the research and development of products and services that have less impact on climate and the environment. Our three goals for the supply chain carbon management are:CSR On-Site Audits and Capacity Promotion

Chunghwa Telecom ‚Äú5I SDGs‚Äù Initiative
As the pilot of CSR, Chunghwa Telecom has developed its core competence to positively minimize the digital divide and 
devote itself to the creation of digital opportunities. Since 2015, we have chosen to connect with the 2030 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Through real action we have demonstrated our determination to develop 
and implement global sustainabilities.
In 2017, we promoted the ‚Äú5I SDGs‚Äù initiative: ‚ÄúI Helping, I Sharing, I Learning, I Programming and I Protecting," as the first 
real initiative in Taiwan that connects Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the ‚ÄúDigital Country Innovative Economy Development Program‚Äù (DIGI √ê) from the Executive Yuan. Expanding partnerships in collaboration with NPO/NGO, helped 
us support the sharing of knowledge and technology resources. This enabled us to create a connection between the underprivileged and other diverse groups in this digital era. Technology allows us to link to the good cycle and realize a win-win situation for digital human rights and an innovative economy at the same time.
Win-win is beneficial to the implementation 
of CSR; beneficial to the digital economy and beneficial to global sustainability 
development by connection with SDGs.
Goal
 Spirit
To construct a digital inclusion society, we 
use ICT technology as an instrument and corporate volunteers as the point to go deep into Taiwan communities to promote and popularize establishments.  We also increase social innovation and information equality through R&D innovation and actual practices as well.
Vision
The ‚Äú2017 Taipei Marathon‚Äù started on December the 17th and attracted more than 10 thousand participants. CHT 
leads the corporate sports culture internally, in order to present its support of the sports industry, we recruited corporate 
volunteers to respond to the event. More than 500 of our employees signed up within a week. After extensive selections 
and draws, we finally selected 50 corporate volunteers to act as support persons to the runners at the Renai-Xinsheng intersection supply depot, which is about five kilometers from the site, and encouraged them with actual practices.
The Chunghwa Telecom Chairman Yu Cheng said: ‚ÄúWe are dedicated to promote sports fashion and 
build a healthy enterprise culture. Through the guidance of managers and help from volunteers, we encourage employees to exercise regularly to maintain a sustainable and healthy corporate culture. 
We share our internal successful experience to push popularization of exercise nationwide, and we‚Äôll 
keep recruiting corporate volunteers to improve our social responsibilities. In the future, Chunghwa Telecom will continue to lead corporate volunteers to do more different tasks and help to create a 
happy and healthy Taiwan.‚ÄùCorporate Volunteer Participation in 2017 Taipei Marathon

Strategy 1 Minimize the Digital Divide
 Strategy 2 Create Digital Opportunities360 Degree of Digital Inclusion Actions
Chunghwa Telecom focuses its social investment in ‚Äúminimizing the digital divide‚Äù and the ‚Äúcreating of digital opportunities,‚Äù 
given the specific nature and the core competence of information and communication in the ICT industry. We also spare 
no effort in the advocacy of ‚Äúcorporate volunteers‚Äù to participate in local community services, and proactively assist the 
communities in creating digital opportunities. We promote all aspects of digital inclusion using 360-degree vision.
In 2017 Chunghwa Telecom established 35 sites for accessibility to telecom services in long-term support of a government 
initiative to protect fundamental rights to communications.
Chunghwa Telecom refers to the community investment evaluation mechanism of the LBG (London Benchmark Group), to 
conduct evaluations on the possible community social benefits and business opportunities before an investment is made. 
The quantification of the contribution of social investment allows us to make reasonable resources allocation, while avoiding repetition. It helps the decision-making and promotion of charities as well as future sponsorship.Social Investment Management

More ‚ÄúDigital Good Neighbors‚Äù >
In 2006, Chunghwa Telecom created the Chunghwa Telecom Foundation with 
the purpose of implementing corporate social responsibility, through long-term 
cultivation of our core competence, to communities and tribes, and the urban fringe, 
as well as areas with a relative lack of resources. The Foundation is a platform 
of resources for connection and the rearrangement of ‚Äúgood‚Äù materials shared 
to needed locations. It has become the strength that supports and assists the 
advancement of these local areas.
To minimize the digital divide between cities and counties, the Chunghwa Telecom 
Foundation collectively promotes digital application with local organizations as a 
resource platform. NGOs that have a demand for resources can apply to the ‚ÄúDigital 
Good Neighbors.‚Äù The foundation evaluates all local demand for digital resources, 
selects remote tribes that lack resources and provides senior services, child and 
youth education, care for the disadvantaged and new immigrants. This is done in 
close cooperation with local social welfare institutions to minimize the digital divide 
and guarantee basic digital rights to everyone.
The ‚ÄúChunghwa Telecom Digital Good Neighbors‚Äù provides program resources 
according to local need, these include digital training courses, youth volunteer 
events, art and reading activities, CHT Women‚Äôs Basketball, industrial assistance, 
recorded video learning and more. Up to the end of 2017, we were cooperating 
with 92 different NGOs and our tracks were all over Taiwan. There were Chunghwa 
Telecom Digital Good Neighbors locations in some really far away places, including 
the Qalang Smangus Tribe, and in surrounding islands.
Although school education includes PC information courses, time is often limited and also not every household has PC 
hardware. We extend learning to many communities through ‚ÄúDigital Good Neighbors‚Äù locations and encourage ‚ÄúI Learning‚Äù 
and the utilization of digital equipment of ‚Äú5I SDGs‚Äù we support. In 2017, 1,691 hours of training was given to 4,000 persons.The Chunghwa Telecom Foundation √ëThe Digital Good Neighbors
Continuous Promotion of Digital Application and Encourage Utilization of Digital EquipmentMinimizing the Digital Divide
The Presbyterian Church in the Tainan Houbi District has cooperated 
with the foundation in the cultivation of video recording training 
courses for six years. The training starts with basic image making and 
composition and proceeds to storytelling, scriptwriting, interviews and 
filming (video) practice exercises. We have accumulated a collection of 
excellent student material. During the 2017 summer vacation, students 
combined years of learning to jointly create an MV. This was the result 
of comprehensive education in a local area through the auspices of the 
Foundation and encouraged local storytelling through videos. 
In recent years, the demand for tuition in the use of mobile devices by the 
elderly has risen. In 2017, we initiated smartphone courses at the Yong 
le community in Linbian Township, Pingtung County. We started with an 
introduction to the use of a mobile phone and the elderly in the community 
have now learned to use Facebook, Line, image software and karaoke 
software to enrich their daily lives and there is now a considerable amount 
of communication between neighbors. We encourage lifelong learning by the 
elderly through ‚Äúlive and learn.‚ÄùCorporate

Every community has its own characteristics and we base our development direction on these characteristics and introduce 
different project contents to assist local sustainable development. In 2017, the foundation collaborated with the ‚ÄúIfkids 
Theatre‚Äù in a three-day long community tour of art teaching courses for children to reveal individual learning and artistic 
capacity. The children also took part in dramatic performances that gave them the chance to be part of something that 
would become an unforgettable experience. We also promoted art popularization, and held community reading courses to 
cultivate independent and creative thinking abilities of the children.
To promote local business, the foundation often holds ‚Äúfestive gift‚Äù fairs each year and encourage corporate employees and 
departments to purchase products of local businesses. At the end of 2017, we invited six local businesses to hold a festive 
activity of selling local products as souvenirs to support high-quality local businesses.
In addition, we have long been cultivating domestic women basketball players and bring basketball to the community 
and tribes through ‚ÄúCHT Women‚Äôs Basketball Team.‚Äù To discover and cultivate more domestic potential seeded players in 
basketball, we held ‚ÄúPublic Welfare 3 on 3 Basketball Event‚Äù around the nation. In 2017, three public welfare competitions 
were held in Taoyuan, Kaohsiung and Penghu with the participation of 548 teams.Cultivation of Local Characteristics and Assistance in Sustainable Development

Most Digital Good Neighbors were at inconvenient locations 
and funds were difficult to raise. Getting performing arts 
groups to come was also very difficult. Through our Art 
Project, we brought the art groups into these communities 
and tribes in 2010 to correct this situation.
To discover and cultivate basketball seeded players, our 
CHT Women‚Äôs Basketball Team participates in social 
activities to introduce national champion level players to the 
communities and tribes.
We invited local businesses to attend festive gifts ‚Äúpre-

of Social and Regional DevelopmentThe purpose of this program is to give college students opportunities to understand 
communities, tribes and local cultures. To this end, the foundation cooperated with 
the Department of Radio & Television of National Chengchi University in 2009 in 
‚ÄúClick Taiwan.‚Äù During summer vacations, university students were invited to provide 
services for 15-20 days at various Digital Good Neighbors. They were encouraged 
to apply what they learned ‚Äúwhile serving while recording‚Äù in the local communities 
and at the same time capture local stories on camera. The ‚ÄúClick Taiwan‚Äù encourages 
young adults to make real changes to their lives, to step outside their comfort zone 
and experience different things, to learn about themselves and the environment they 
grew up from a different perspective.
The 2017 9th ‚ÄúClick Taiwan‚Äù program received 364 applications from 156 departments 
in 76 universities nationwide. Fifty students were selected to perform services and 
capture stories at 23 Digital Good Neighbors in remote areas. These students came 
from different backgrounds, schools and departments, and had devoted themselves 
to community services by contributing their own specialties. This included the creation 
of stories, games designed for grandparent-grandchild interaction, production 
assistance with video material advertising tribal tours, the promotion of oral hygiene, 
event recording, graffiti art and photography courses. They captured real motivating 
stories with their cameras.
To encourage more youth participation and get a better effect, we held photography 
exhibition excursions through the campuses of different colleges nationwide to share 
theme videos within school courses. In 2017, we held 29 ‚ÄúClick Taiwan‚Äù campus 
photography exhibition tours, with the participation of more than 2,300 students. They 
were all encouraged to return to their hometowns to serve their local communities.Chunghwa Telecom Foundation √ëClick TaiwanBy utilizing our expertise in telecom technology, we will ensure that everyone shares the advantage of technology despite 
financial or social standing, or geographical location. In this way we hope to quickly achieve the objective of minimizing the 
digital divide and creating digital opportunity. In addition to previously described action plans and subsidy, different from those 
of other enterprises, we also contributed resources to developing related products and services to meet the needs of the 
disabled and allow them to realize their right of access to the digital technology universe.The Creation of Digital Opportunities

Chunghwa Telecom has supported education and shown its concern for rural villages ever since 2009, in the aftermath of 
Typhoon Morakot. We extended our services to the permanent settlements and newly developed communities in the disaster 
zones. Using visual Internet technology, we delivered educational resources in the form of private tutorship in rural villages 
for the unfortunate. We hope to give the children of the next generation a learning environment which is ‚Äúsafe, dignified, and 
hopeful.‚ÄùPC Education/Network Tutoring
GoalBy 2022, we hope to:
hAssist 2,900  in the remote areas students with network tutoring
hAccumulate more than 4,500 volunteers to participate in network tutoring
hAccumulate more than 100,000  volunteer hours for network tutoring and training
CharacteristicOnline education by university students helps pupils of junior high schools and primary schools in the rural 
villages to enhance their learning and provides equal learning opportunities.
MethodTo realize the spirit of stakeholder engagement, we have cooperated with the Center of Care Services for 
Rural Area Education in Taiwan, and the Fu Jen Catholic University, in online education. University students 
helped the cause with one-on-one tutoring to take care of the school children in the rural villages and 
disaster zones.

Major ResulthUniversity students helped the cause with one-on-one individual tutoring of the school children in rural 
villages. They also took care of their need for personal communication and interaction.
hTen years of effort by e-Tutor partners has helped several dozen students gain admission to national and 
private universities, including the National Yang Ming University and Taipei Medical University. Assistance 
to remote villages has really reduced the divide between the cities and counties and radically improved 
the opportunities available to the children.

We take advantage of corporate information and communication resources to support the visually impaired. In 2017, we 
collaborated with the Taiwan Telecommunications Industry Development Association to respond to the Suang Lien Foundation 
promotion of ‚ÄúSecondhand iPhones For the Visually Impaired Assistance Plan.‚Äù In addition to a donation of 50 used phones 
with Senao International, we also provided a free Wi-Fi training classroom for the ‚ÄúiPhone Course for the Visually Impaired‚Äù to 
ensure them the same opportunities and basic communications rights as others.
The Chunghwa Telecom corporate volunteer assistance plan entered its third stage in 2017. The corporate volunteers reset all 
the collected iPhones to ‚Äúfactory setting‚Äù status, each visually impaired persons who had completed the training was given an 
iPhone.
‚ÄúSenior Citizens App‚Äù was the first application developed by Chunghwa Telecom and the Institute for Information 
Industry that addresses the needs of the elderly. The App has several useful features including: phone assistance, 
a contact list, caller announcement, weather inquiry, health reminder, emergency contact, photo sharing, and 
video streaming. This App will make Smartphones and Tablets more user-friendly for older people and further 
minimize the digital divide.We believe ‚Äúhumanity to be the foundation of technology innovation.‚Äù In 2013, we launched a ‚ÄúVoice-based 
Personal Assistance App‚Äù that was specifically designed for the visually impaired. The App incorporates image, 
voice, reading, and lifestyle functions to assist both visually impaired and elders to face some of their difficulties. 
By the end of 2017, the App had been downloaded 50,826 times. It is one of the most convenient and useful 
personal assistants available.I Helping √ëCorporate Volunteers Training

times by the end of 2017.
Completion of an iOS version of the Senior Assistant 
App will include a push notification function to 
remind users of video broadcasts, news, software 
updates, self-development and health information.Results Achieved
Future TargetChunghwa Telecom has engaged in long-term cooperation with the Resource Center for the Visually Impaired at Tamkang 
University for more than 30 years and the EYE Social Innovative Call Center was set up in 2011. This joint effort led to the 
unveiling of the first ‚ÄúTotal Solution‚Äù in Taiwan. This includes research and development of a computer-assisted telephone 
system, the improvement and the training and supervision of talent and the development of skill in customer phone service 
personnel who respond to the needs of the visually impaired.
In 2015, the Company completed an upgrade to the Taipei City 1999 hotline, making it user-friendly to the visually 
impaired. This upgrade included: a real-time notification system, a three-way call feature with voice recording, English/
Japanese services, a verbal abuse referral feature, a call duration reminder, a health regulation inquiry feature, and a quick 
link to service sub-categories. These upgrades greatly improved the scope and efficiency of the service.
By the end of 2017, the ‚ÄúTotal Solution‚Äù had provided eight working opportunities for the satisfaction surveyors of 
Chunghwa Telecom (including one visually impaired manager), who are responsible for the production of about 5,000 
valid questionnaires each month. There were another fifteen customer service personnel (12 visually impaired and 3 
supervisors) for the Taipei City 1999 hotline. They process an average of 16,055 calls each month.
We initiated new employment opportunities for persons with spinal injuries. Two with severe injury serve as 4G visual 
assistance service persons. They assist with image identification for the visually impaired through the 4G cloud services. 
This helps promote their quality of daily life and independence while providing employment opportunities for the severely 
disabled.
The automated voice system for donations developed by Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories has proved to be helpful for 
charities, social welfare, cultural, educational, and environmental protection institutions. It gives donors a more convenient 
means of donation. A donor simply needs to pick up their cell phones, dial the number, and follow the voice prompts to 
contribute care to those in need.
In 2013, the Company introduced a QR code-based mobile payment service that allows users to make donations by simply 
scanning the appropriate QR Code. This makes public welfare donation more intelligent. The feature enables funds to be raised 
through other channels, in addition to those at convenience stores and websites.EYE Social Innovative Call Center Creates Employment Opportunities for the Visually Impaired

Public Policy Participation 2 √ëPaying Attention to Communications Convergence DevelopmentIn accordance with the government decision to implement the ‚ÄúTaoyuan Aerotropolis Plan,‚Äù we invited 70 international 
and national leaders, representing the Intelligent Aerotropolis industrial ecosystem, to establish the ‚ÄúTaiwan Intelligent 
Aerotropolis Association (TIAA).‚Äù Having envisioned ‚ÄúForge a city of smart logistics and of industrial advance 
technologies,‚Äù the TIAA exists to offer insightful advice for the development of the Taoyuan Aerotropolis.
TIAA had already completed a proposal for ‚ÄúRegulatory Guidelines for Establishing Taiwan as the Asia Silicon Valley‚Äù and 
made policy recommendations about its realization. Representatives from the Executive Yuan Technology Report Office 
and Taoyuan City Government were invited to the forum for a briefing on the TIAA recommendation, so that the industry 
participants, government officials and the academia could achieve consensus about the ‚ÄúAsian Silicon Valley.‚Äù In addition, 
TTIA collaborated with the Taoyuan City Government to hold the ‚ÄúForesight, Innovation, Intelligent Aerotropolis Forum‚Äù in 
2017, which attracted more than 300 government officials and academics.
Chunghwa Telecom operations are very closely linked to changes in government policies or regulations. The Company 
is in regular contact with government agencies and authorities to ensure they are informed about any possible 
changes in important policies and regulations. The most important is concern about ICT industry competitiveness and 
‚ÄúCommunications Convergence Plans.‚Äù
The National Communications Commission (NCC) announced new policy guidelines in August 2016 that include the 
adjustment and re-drafting of the existing regulatory framework for digital convergence. In April 2017, the NCC passed 
drafts of the ‚ÄúTelecommunications Management Act‚Äù and the ‚ÄúDigital Communication Act‚Äù and reported to the Executive 
Yuan for deliberation. The Executive Yuan passed the two drafts in November and submitted them to the Legislative Yuan. 
The drafts are now being examined by the Transportation Committee of the Legislative Yuan. Chunghwa Telecom will keep 
monitoring the situation concerning these amendments and express an opinion when appropriate.Taiwan Intelligent Aerotropolis Association: http://www.tiaa.com.tw/
Public Policy Participation 3 √ëSupporting Development of the Gaming Industry
Public Policy Participation 4 √ëLive Broadcast from the Legislative Yuan on the MOD PlatformChunghwa Telecom supports the government in the development of the gaming 
industry and supported the really big gaming competition in 2017. In addition 
to arranging HiNet high-speed broadband at the semi-finals and the finale in six 
municipalities, we also broadcast the competition through the Internet and live 
broadcast platform.
We will continue to connect the resources of game-related industrial chains 
through our strength in communications and firmly support Taiwan gamers and 
potential gamers in building a high-quality gaming environment. In addition 
to driving the growth momentum of the Taiwan gaming industry, we also fully 
support our local gamers.
Chunghwa Telecom has the biggest audio-visual platform MOD in Taiwan that provides abundant visual content and a 
strong public information communication function, This indirectly promotes information transparency in Parliamentary 
procedures and helps to achieve the government goal of transparency.
The Legislative Yuan completed the establishment of a live broadcast facility in February 2017. It can broadcast directly 
through the Chunghwa Telecom MOD, cable and wireless television and the IVOD parliamentary procedures broadcast 
system. Current figures show an audience of 16 million people watch Congress through the exclusive 123 and 124 
channels, The parliamentary procedures broadcast system not only covers the Legislative Yuan meetings but records and 
broadcasts committee meetings and consultations amongst political parties. MOD also has a watch on-demand function 
to play past proceedings. The general public can check the situation in Congress and watch the development of Laws 
through the Internet at any time.

Chunghwa Telecom has been sponsoring the main Taiwan Lantern 
Festival for 20 consecutive years. Since 1999 we have continued to 
light up the hearts of the people of Taiwan.
In 2017, the main lantern of the Taiwan Lantern Festival was 
designed to demonstrate three main themes of ‚ÄúFriendliness to 
the Earth,‚Äù ‚ÄúCultural Diversity ‚Äùand ‚ÄúIndigenous Hometown.‚Äù The 
spirit of the festival was extended to sub-themes such as ‚ÄúLOHAS 
Sustainability.‚Äù We also reinforced the 4G quality all around Taiwan 
during the festival. 
We listen and care about the demands of our stakeholders. We 
arranged for services at all the 12 different festival locations around 
Taiwan and the network equipment was monitored by Chunghwa 
Telecom engineers throughout the event. Through the widest range 
of mobile networks, the largest number of base stations and the 
maximum 4G bandwidth, the public can take pictures, check in and 
share information more smoothly.
Public Policy Participation 6 √ëSupport Equipment for Major Events
Chunghwa Telecom has been supporting major sports events and competitions in Taiwan for a long time. We provide 
flawless communication equipment and digital services and spare no effort in providing the highest level of service. In 
2017, we sponsored the Summer Universiade with the social participation amount of NT$ 100 million. We‚Äôve achieved 
the following:
Planned the network construction and transmission for 80 different event locations in Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan 
and Hsinchu.
Deployed more than 400 circuits and mobilized more than 2,500 technicians and engineers.
