 SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY 
DTE Energy recognizes that operating a sustainable business enterprise  
requires us to:
1.   Addr ess the transformational challenge of climate change  
2.  Develop renewable energy assets  
3.  Support our local communities
DTE Energy is pursuing an ambitious carbon reduction agenda, including  
a plan for the closure of all remaining coal-fired units, with the ultimate 
goal of more than 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050,  
consistent with the scientific consensus for limiting global warming to  
2 degrees Celsius. 
CLIMATE CHANGE
Background
DTE Energy is strongly committed to sharply reducing carbon emissions in a manner that  
is safe, maintains reliability and affordability for our customers. We have invested substantial 
time and resources in building a strategy to address climate change, which our chairman and 
CEO, Gerry Anderson, has described as the defining policy issue of our era. Well before the  
August 2015 announcement of the U.S. Clean Power Plan and the December 2015 adoption  
of the Paris Agreement, DTE Energy had started its transition toward a lower carbon profile 
for our generation fleet. Since 2005, we have reduced our carbon dioxide emissions by  
approximately 24 percent.
Carbon Reduction Plan
DTE Energy’s commitment to provide energy that is both 
affordable and sustainable resulted in our industry-leading 
May 2017 announcement: we are undertaking a broad 
sustainability initiative to dramatically reduce the 
company’s carbon emissions. This comprehensive plan 
includes (1) steady retirement of all our remaining  
coal generation units, (2) construction of at least an 
additional 4,000 megawatts of renewable generation, 
(3) construction of up to 3,500 megawatts of new 
natural gas generation, (4) heavy investment in energy 
waste reduction and reducing peak demand, together 
with extensive investment in modernization of the 
electric grid and gas infrastructure. This plan will 
achieve a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from 
2005 levels by the early 2020s, a 45 percent reduction by 2030, a 75 percent reduction by 
2040 and an 80 percent or higher reduction by 2050. We will continue to review technology 
development, electricity demand and economics and make additional low and zero emission 
modifications to the plan in the best interest of our customers.
2018 EEI/AGA ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   4
Scenario Analysis
The feasibility of our carbon reduction plan was confirmed in the 2017 Integrated Resource 
Plan (IRP) filed with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) by our electric utility. In 
the IRP, we analyzed multiple scenarios, including different sensitivities relating to gas prices 
and electricity market prices, as well as different cost and performance curves for renewable 
technologies. In evaluating these scenarios, it became clear that our IRP can support very 
robust carbon reduction targets. Our carbon reduction plan assumes a tighter reduction curve 
than mandated by the Clean Power Plan and higher levels of renewable generation.
Two Degree Scenario
Through our carbon reduction plan DTE Energy’s is committed to being a part of the 
solution to the global climate crisis. There is broad scientific consensus that achieving 
80 percent carbon reduction by 2050 will be necessary to begin to limit the global  
temperature increase below two degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels. 80%

ACHIEVING DTE’S SUSTAINABILITY GOALS 
Our carbon reduction commitment is not mandated. As such, it is essential that we pursue 
the commitment in a manner that supports two other critical priorities our customers  
expect: reliability and affordability. The greatest threat to our carbon commitment would 
come from choosing (or being asked to adopt) an approach to achieving it which threatens 
either affordability or reliability.
For this reason, we are focused on pursuing the most economic path to sharp carbon  
reductions, with a keen eye on reliability. At present, as we continue to retire baseload coal 
units, our analysis calls for adding both high-efficiency natural gas generation (to backfill 
baseload energy and provide 24x7 reliability) and significant new renewable investments 
(primarily wind in the near-term, with increasing solar deployment over time).
We filed an IRP with the MPSC, which considered several scenarios with a range of  
assumptions. The proposed 2017 IRP is supported by all the scenarios we considered  
as part of the planning process. This 2017 IRP lays the foundation to reach the 80 percent  
by 2050 carbon reduction target consistent with the scientific community’s consensus to 
limit global warming less than 2 degrees Celsius by 2050. 
These scenarios include assumptions for:
•  High and low gas prices (from $2.70 in the near term and rising to $8.40 by 2035) 
•  Renewables (ranging from only when economic up to 50 percent of the portfolio) 
•  CO2 (ranging from no CO2 price up to $40 per ton for allowances)
Base assumptions considered in the 2017 IRP include:
•  Majority of existing coal facilities retired by 2030 (exception Monroe Power Plant)
•   Multiple energy efficiency programs deliver annual energy savings of 1.5 percent  
(exceeding the Michigan minimum energy savings requirement)
•  Demand response programs are expected to grow over the next 5 to 10 years
2018 EEI/AGA ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   6
Assumptions that are critical to the success of the plan include:
•   Availability, cost and siting of renewable resources. If renewable costs decrease and 
availability increases more than we have forecasted, renewables become more attractive 
in our plan. Conversely, if we continue to encounter challenges to siting wind renewables, 
solar or natural gas may be more attractive options in our plan. We have studied the  
economics of battery storage intensively. While we are deploying them for specific uses 
on our distribution grid, batteries are not yet economic to serve in conjunction with  
renewables as a baseload power replacement. As battery prices fall over time, their  
potential uses will expand.  
•   Availability and affordability of natural gas. Replacing coal with natural gas yields a 
~70 percent reduction in CO2 and high efficiency gas power plants are currently a very 
economical means to backfill a portion of the coal-fired generation we are retiring with 
a highly reliable, low-carbon resource. Our plan assumes that natural gas will continue 
to be an available and affordable fuel source. Natural gas will play an important role in 
ensuring electric reliability and if our ability to use this fuel source were to be limited,  
we may need to alter our plan.  
DTE will continue to evaluate changes in load, energy/commodity markets, regulatory rules, 
legislative requirements, environmental impacts and technologies that may affect the plan.

RENEWABLE GENERATION
History and Targets 
DTE Energy has complied with all state-mandated targets for renewable energy. Previous 
legislation had required a 10 percent renewable standard by 2015, which we have met or 
exceeded each applicable year. The most recent energy legislation sets a 12.5 percent  
renewable energy target by 2019 and 15 percent by 2021. DTE Energy is well positioned to 
meet these future goals with the addition of new generation resources currently planned  
or under development. Our carbon reduction plan anticipates that by 2040 our electric 
generation portfolio will consist of 20 percent nuclear, 40 percent renewables and  
40 percent natural gas.
Wind Energy
Since 2009, DTE Energy has developed substantial wind 
energy resources in Michigan, driving Michigan into the 
top 15 states in the nation for wind production. In 2017,  
we generated or contracted for more than 3 million  
megawatt hours of wind-generated electricity, enough  
to power more than 370,000 homes.  
We see wind energy as an important part of our future 
generation portfolio; it is currently the most efficient and 
cost-effective form of renewable energy for our region  
of the country. With much of our wind generation  
concentrated north of Detroit (particularly in Huron  
County), we are exploring other areas within Michigan 
for potential development. We work diligently to maintain 
strong community support as we pursue new wind projects. 
Solar Power
With 31 solar projects in its portfolio, DTE Energy  
continues to be Michigan’s largest producer of solar  
energy. We recently opened our Lapeer Solar Park,  
situated on more than 250 acres and comprised of 
200,000 solar panels — one of the largest utility-owned 
solar parks in the Midwest. We also developed a large  
urban solar array at Detroit’s O’Shea Park. This project  
is the result of a unique public-private partnership with  
the City of Detroit in which DTE Energy redeveloped  
nearly 10 acres of previously vacant land, helping to  
revitalize the surrounding neighborhood. In 2017, our solar 
projects generated more than 82,000 megawatt hours.
We have additional solar projects in various stages  
of planning. We anticipate that the price of solar panels 
and the costs of installation and will continue to decline,  
making solar power an increasingly attractive element to  
include in our renewable portfolio. 
2018 EEI/AGA ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   8
Biomass Generation
DTE Energy’s non-utility Power and Industrial Projects 
group is a national leader in developing landfill-gas  
capture systems and in converting small coal-fired  
power plants to run on biomass fuels, generating enough 
renewable energy to supply the equivalent of 238,000 
homes. In addition, this group operates facilities at  
several coal-fired power plants to treat coal prior to  
combustion, resulting in reduced emissions of nitrogen 
oxide and mercury. DTE Energy continues to pursue 
growth opportunities in renewable energy and  
environmental controls.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
Our Aspiration
DTE Energy aspires to be a force for growth in the communities where we live  
and serve. This aspiration grew out of our employees’ genuine desire to help build 
a better future for Michigan and its communities during the economic crisis of  
2009-2010. When our employees asked, “What can we do to help this still struggling  
region?” we responded by asking them to play a critical role in becoming a best-  
operated company that provides our customers with excellent service, and use  
our economic scale to help our communities grow and prosper. 
To be a force for growth in our communities, we have organized our efforts  
around the following focus areas:

•   In addition to our carbon reduction plan outlined 
above, we have initiatives underway aimed at  
reducing our company’s own utilization of energy, 
water and waste by 25 percent by 2022.
•   Through energy efficiency programs, we will help our 
customers reduce their utilization of energy over the 
next five years, in both gas (1 percent annual reduction) 
and electricity (1.5 percent annual reduction).
•   Our chairman and CEO, Gerry Anderson, was  
presented with the Individual Climate Leadership 
Award at the Climate Leadership Conference in 
March 2018, for exemplifying extraordinary  
leadership in addressing climate change.
Economic Progress
•   DTE Energy is helping to lead the establishment of 
a regional economic development organization for 
Southeast Michigan to drive the region’s overall 
development strategy, facilitate collaboration among 
existing development agencies, and centralize  
research and analytical tools for the region.
•   Our chairman and CEO, Gerry Anderson, helped 
launch a working group of regional CEOs and other 
private sector leaders to discuss critical issues  
facing the region and to coordinate efforts on  
specific initiatives critical to the success of  
Southeast Michigan.
