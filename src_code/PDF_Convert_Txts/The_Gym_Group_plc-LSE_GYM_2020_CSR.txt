Sustainability  
at The Gym 
Group
Our sustainability strategy was created to help deliver 
our purpose and consists of five key pillars, as defined by 
our ‘sustainability wheel’. Our 2022 report highlights our 
performance and activities during the year, in line with  
our strategy. 
We continue to report with reference to Global Reporting 
Initiative 2021 Universal Standards and against 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Leisure 
Facilities Standards. Full reporting can be found on our 
website along with our sustainability strategy, materiality 
matrix, and sustainability governance structures.
We were the first carbon neutral gym chain in the UK and 
have again offset our remaining carbon emissions for 2022 
through investment in carefully chosen and Gold Standard 
certified carbon offset projects in support of our journey 
to net zero.At The Gym Group, we remain committed 
to breaking down barriers to fitness, 
enabling everyone to live healthier 
and more rewarding lives, within the 
natural balance of the planet. The cost- 
of- living crisis, driven by high inflation 
and compounded by the soaring cost 
of energy, has presented a range of 
challenges for UK society, including  
The Gym Group and our members.  
Our low cost and accessible gym model, 
which is delivered in a resilient and 
sustainable way, is therefore more 
compelling than ever.
Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’) 
reporting and explored further water 
management measures.
At COP27 , UN Secretary General 
António Guterres made some of his 
strongest comments yet on global 
warming, saying, “our planet is fast 
approaching tipping points that will 
make climate chaos irreversible”. The 
UN’s environment agency (‘UNEP’) 
reported that there is “no credible 
pathway to 1.5°C in place”, and the 
only way to limit the worst impacts 
of the climate change crisis is a 
“rapid transformation of societies”. 
The report highlights that, if current 
pledges of action were delivered in full 
by 2030, then we would experience a 
rise in global temperature of about 
2.5°C, with catastrophic effects.
Our commitment to net zero has taken 
a significant step forward this year, 
with a full submission to the Science 
Based Targets initiative (‘SBTi’); this 
includes the recalculation of our 2019 
carbon footprint – our baseline year. 
Our Green House Gas (‘GHG’) 
emissions are therefore restated 
in this report and we have removed 
data for 2020 and 2021; this is due 
to the lack of comparability owing to 
the significant impact of Covid-19 on 
our operations. Our 2022 emissions 
are stated in line with this revised 
calculation for direct comparison.Social impact  
Research into the benefits of exercise 
clearly shows that when our members 
visit our gyms at least four times 
a month, improvements in their 
physical health, mental wellbeing 
and social development (social 
value) are achieved. We therefore 
introduced a new performance metric 
in 2022, to help us track our positive 
social impact. In 2022, the Covid-19 
pandemic continued to impact our 
ability to deliver this societal benefit, 
with further disruption from the 
pandemic in January and February. 
This report sets out how we have 
achieved our target and delivered 
an increase of 8% in social value 
compared to 2019 by enabling over  
53 million gym visits.
The environment 
The UK saw a record temperature of 
40.3°C in July 2022, 1.6 °C higher than 
the previous record. Across the globe, 
2022 has been a year of extreme 
climate events claiming hundreds 
of thousands of lives and displacing 
millions of people. We are in a period 
of ‘climate changed’ as well as climate 
change, and we are evaluating both 
risks and opportunities to ensure our 
business is resilient to this change. 
We have expanded our assessment 
of climate-related impacts within 
our Task Force on Climate-Related Diversity and equal opportunity
The Gym Group is a place where we 
want everyone to feel included and 
accepted, with equal opportunities 
to succeed, and we continue to make 
progress towards our goals. We were 
also delighted to be recognised by 
Reward Gateway in their Engagement 
Excellence Awards.
Good jobs and quality 
education
This year was our first time 
assessment for the We Invest In 
Wellbeing accreditation where we 
achieved silver. We also received 
the Best Places To Work award by 
Glassdoor and maintained our 
Investors In People Gold accreditation. 
Human rights, anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption 
We conduct our business honestly 
and ethically wherever we operate. 
Our Human Rights Policy Statement 
and Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Policy Statement can be found on our 
website. We also have a detailed Anti-
Bribery and Corruption policy, which 
is available to all employees via our 
intranet along with training.

Our people first culture 
is vital to our success 
and remains a business 
focus at The Gym Group. 
Through our ‘people 
promise’ we are committed 
to supporting our 
employees in their career 
adventures, providing  
new opportunities and  
a culture where people  
can achieve their goals.
 
The impact of the increase in the cost- 
of-living brought us new challenges in 
2022 and looking after our people’s 
wellbeing and talent development 
has remained a business priority. To 
deliver this, we have implemented 
development programmes across 
a variety of roles and continued to 
provide wellbeing support through the 
delivery of our LeadWell programme 
in partnership with Outliers Wellbeing, 
covering topics such as psychological 
safety and tackling burnout.  
 
Employee engagement  
We have continued to utilise our 
annual engagement surveys to listen 
to our teams’ experiences, and we 
have used the findings to shape our 
people strategy. Feedback from our 2021 engagement survey results 
indicated that our people were 
looking for additional opportunities 
to learn and develop. In response 
to initiatives launched in 2022, we 
have seen key drivers of employee 
engagement, such as job satisfaction 
and opportunities to learn and 
develop, increase by 8 and 10 
percentage points respectively.
Employee learning and 
development 
We relaunched our ‘Emerging 
Talent’ management development 
programme in May 2022, providing 
high potential Assistant General 
Managers with development 
pathways into General Manager 
roles. This achieved huge success, 
with a 95% retention rate and 42% 
promotion rate in this first cohort. 
In June we expanded the ‘Emerging 
Talent’ framework by launching a 
bespoke Fitness Trainer programme, 
which serves to provide the skills 
required to progress. This resulted in 
an 83% retention rate, with 65% of 
participants securing promotions to 
Assistant General Manager positions. 
By providing opportunities to develop 
into management roles, we hope to 
grow and retain our internal talent 
pipelines and will continue to deliver 
our Emerging Talent programmes 
in 2023. We also introduced new 
apprenticeship development 
opportunities across our Gym 
Support function, which enables 
existing employees to undertake a 
professional qualification relevant 
to their role, such as accountancy, 
marketing and leadership. In 2023, 
we will expand apprenticeship 
opportunities to support our Gym 
Operations teams. 
 
As we move into 2023, we will remain 
focused on delivering internal 
development programmes and aim 
to introduce targets to measure the 
effectiveness of these programmes. 
Development in 2023 will be focusing 
on female leadership, conscious 
leadership and building a future 
leader’s pipeline for gym operations. 
 
In our communities 
The UK Government’s Kickstart 
Scheme — designed to provide 
job placement opportunities for 
young adults at risk of long term 
unemployment — concluded this  
year. Since joining the scheme in 
December 2020, we have given  
234 young people the opportunity 
to gain work experience and a 
qualification in fitness.

General Manager at

shares her career and 
development adventure 
at The Gym Group.
I joined The Gym Group in 2019 
as a Fitness Instructor but was 
always really interested in the 
operational side of the business. 
With the ongoing support and 
encouragement of my manager, I 
applied for the Assistant General 
Manager role and in 2021, achieved 
my first step into management. I 
instantly knew this was the right 
path for me and loved leading, 
educating and motivating my own 
team of Fitness Trainers, as part of 
my new role.
In 2022, I was selected to take part 
in the Emerging Talent leadership 
development programme. This 
programme was a huge support in 
fast tracking my career at The Gym 
Group, and I was soon promoted 
to General Manager. The modules 
within the programme helped build 
my understanding of the role and 
the skills and knowledge required to 
deliver in this position. 
 “Completing the 
Emerging Talent 
programme has not  
only fuelled my  
knowledge but also  
my passion for working  
at The Gym Group.”13

this scheme we will launch The 
Gym Group Academy to provide a 
framework for multiple pathways 
into a career in fitness. The scheme 
will deliver further education, 
experience and the personal 
training certifications required to 
become a Fitness Trainer. The Gym 
Group Academy will focus on those 
currently on universal credit, hard 
to reach demographics and women. 
Programmes will run throughout 
the year and range from five day 
work experience placements to 
16 week Grow Your Own Fitness 
Trainer programmes. 
 
Whilst our partnership with the Rio 
Ferdinand Foundation pilot ‘Find Your 
Future’ programme did not generate 
the participant engagement 
anticipated, we were active in 
delivering engagement visits to 
supported community projects.

Good health

Social value  
generated in 2022  
£756m  
(vs £700m  in 2019)
70%
Of social value comes 
from direct NHS cost 
savings and mental 
wellbeing benefits  
to our members 
 The World Health 
Organisation (‘WHO’)  
has long recognised that 
regular physical activity  
is proven to help prevent 
and manage diseases,  
such as heart disease, 
stroke, diabetes and 
several cancers. Exercise 
can also improve mental 
health, quality of life  
and wellbeing.
2022 saw a dramatic increase in 
the cost-of-living, with the crisis 
disproportionately impacting lower 
income demographics. Offering 
affordable facilities to exercise is 
therefore increasingly important.
With 28 new gym openings in 2022,  
we continue to locate 32% of our 
growing estate in the 20% most 
deprived areas of the UK, reinforcing 
our commitment to tackling inactivity 
in disadvantaged communities.
At The Gym Group, we have made it 
our purpose to break down barriers to 
fitness, and not only provide access to 
low cost, safe and high quality fitness 
facilities to our members, but also 
to motivate our members to use our 
gyms regularly.Our network of  
229 gyms affords  
access to  
52.5%
of the UK population  
 
The social impact of  
The Gym Group 
Growing the positive impact our 
business has on our members and 
the communities we serve is central 
to our purpose. We are proud to have 
increased the social value generated 
in 2022, beyond our target by 8% to 
£756 million.This incredible result was not only 
driven by higher membership numbers 
(up 14.3% on 2021) but was also the 
result of our focus on motivating 
our members to exercise in our 
gyms regularly. 
As a business dedicated to generating 
social value, we created a new KPI 
for the Executive Committee to drive 
social value. Performance is measured 
on the percentage of members who 
visit our gyms at least four times a 
month. Our target for 2022 was to 
return to 2019 levels; we exceeded this 
target and achieved a 7.1% increase 
on 2019 to 47.2% by launching a range 
of initiatives including celebrating 
member visits, creating member 
challenges and welcome videos 
for new members to increase the 
accessibility of our gyms. 
Information on how the social value is 
calculated and the Social Value Model 
can be found on our website.Positive impact of

Interview w ith Fraser, member  
at The Gym Group Greenwich
Why did you join The Gym 
Group Greenwich?
I joined The Gym Group because I 
felt that I needed to do a bit more 
for my fitness and find an outlet 
from university stress.
 
What do you like about The 
Gym Group?
The community that is led by Jason 
at The Gym Group Greenwich is 
incredible. When I go to the gym, 
I know I am seeing people that 
genuinely care about me. The 
staff and members are incredibly 
friendly. Importantly, I don’t feel 
judged - it is a social space as well 
as a place to exercise, and whilst I 
go to the gym mostly on my own, 
there are always people around for 
me to talk to and workout with.
 
What role does The Gym 
Group play in your general 
wellbeing?
I was diagnosed with depression 
and anxiety and was prescribed 
anti-depressants to cope with 
day-to-day living. I also had some 
therapy sessions with the NHS and 
my university. However, it felt like I 
had to find my own path to improve 
my mental wellbeing. When gyms 
opened again post pandemic, 
I went regularly. I always look 
forward to going to the gym and 
feel so much better afterwards. 
That positive feeling doesn’t leave 
me, it stays with me for the rest  
of the day.

The safety and security of our people 
remains a priority focus, and we 
have improved processes for both 
our members and employees. This is 
supported by a more sophisticated 
approach to reviewing risk, as well as 
robust strategic crisis management 
plans and emergency action plans.
Our main focus throughout 2022 
was to conform our health and 
safety management system to ISO 
45001:2018. We are now working on 
certification to the ISO standard 
in 2023. 
Our Primary Authority partner, 
Wakefield Council, provides valuable 
insight from a regulatory perspective 
into our management system 
and processes and supports us in 
responding to regulatory queries 
from other Local Authorities. We 
have begun seeking a secondary 
partnership with a Fire Authority.
2022 was the first year of delivering 
an unannounced health and safety 
audit schedule across the business; 
as a result, we observed a marginal 
reduction in our Group audit results, 
in which we obtained an audit score 
of 96%.
Our overall headline accident rate 
hasn’t seen a material change. We 
have developed additional rates for 
more serious accident types which 
demonstrate whilst our overall rate 
remains static, we have seen positive 
reductions in our more serious 
accident and incident types.

Diversity 
and equal 
opportunity
Breaking down barriers 
to fitness and ensuring 
The Gym Group is a place 
where everyone feels 
included and accepted, 
with equal opportunities 
to succeed, remained a 
core focus in 2022. 
Last year, with the impact of the 
cost-of-living crisis, we prioritised 
reviewing our diverse and inclusive 
recruitment practices and 
representation.  To support our 
Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (‘EDI’) 
pledges launched in March 2022, we 
developed recruitment and retention 
KPIs and targets and report progress 
quarterly to the Sustainability 
Committee. Our Chief Development 
and Sustainability Officer, David 
Melhuish, remains the sponsor of 
the EDI group, playing a crucial role 
in raising the agenda and positive 
action on diversity. Overall, we are 
pleased to have reported positive 
progress against our EDI targets, 
however, we recognise that more work 
is required. 
Inclusion at The Gym Group 
Approach to recruitment
To reduce bias and ensure an inclusive 
hiring approach, we introduced 
standardised competency based interviews for all operational 
positions. We also revised job adverts 
to reflect gender neutral language 
and tone, and provided alternative 
application routes for those who 
require adjustments. Additionally, we 
promote flexible working practices 
within our recruitment adverts. To 
further attract diverse talent, we 
released our series of inclusive brand 
videos to showcase the diversity of our 
people and their experiences working 
at The Gym Group. 
We launched our Inclusive Traineeship 
in October 2022, the first of which 
was in partnership with the Down’s 
Syndrome Association, and 
welcomed five amazing trainees. The 
programme has delivered valuable 
work experience within our gyms, 
whilst supporting our trainees with 
their Active IQ Level 1 Award in Fitness 
and Physical Activity. The Traineeship 
has been a success and we intend 
to continue the programme under 
our Gym Academy framework, with 
further cohorts planned for 2023. 
Employee inclusion  
and retention
We have continued to embed our 
employee led EDI working groups 
throughout 2022, which are focused 
on age, cultural diversity, disability, 
gender and LGBTQI+ to drive inclusion 
in the business.In May 2022, we relaunched our 
wellbeing strategy to the business. In 
response to the cost-of-living crisis, 
we focused on providing financial 
and emotional wellbeing support, 
highlighting available resources 
and bringing forward pay reviews. 
We launched the first cohort of our 
new Mental Health Ambassadors 
programme in October, a six-month 
programme providing refresher 
training and upskilling to 24 (existing 
and new) mental health champions to 
further support our colleagues. 
To improve the retention of female 
talent, we investigated the key factors 
impacting our female employees’ 
experiences and drivers to leave the 
business. In 2023, we will use these 
insights to inform our EDI strategy 
and support our gender pledges.
This year, we also joined ukactive’s 
Everyone Can disability taskforce, 
contributing to thought leadership 
and influencing change within 
our sector. 
EDI pledges 2022–2030
Gender
Throughout the year, we have taken 
positive action to support movement 
towards our gender pledges.
In 2022, female representation among 
our senior leaders1 increased by 
6.3 percentage points to 35.1% and 
across the business by 1.5 percentage 
points to 30.7%. Whilst some progress 
has been made, a focus on female 
retention and development will be key 
to achieving our targets. The Gym Group gender balance

69.3%30.7%Gender pay gap
In January 2022, we introduced a 
new director level to the business. 
This resulted in an initial increase in 
males at a senior level, creating a rise 
in our mean gender pay gap to 3.3% 
(versus 1.6% in 2021). Our median pay 
gap remained consistent with 2021 
reporting as most of our employees 
undertake the same role and are 
therefore on the same pay rate, 
regardless of whether they are male 
or female.
Ethnicity pay gap
We collected ethnicity data from 98% 
of our employees enabling greater 
accuracy in our pay gap reporting in 
2022. We are pleased to report our 
mean ethnicity pay gap as of April 
2022 has improved, falling to 14.8% 
(versus 16% in 2021). Our median 
ethnicity pay gap remains at 0% as 
most employees did not change roles 
or pay during the year. We recognise 
that more work is required to reduce 
our mean ethnicity pay gap. 
Our full ethnicity and gender pay  
gap reports, which provide further 
detail on our figures and the actions 
we are taking to address these gaps, 
will be available on our website by the 
end of March 2023.Ethnicity
We continued to collect and monitor 
our employee ethnicity data in 2022. 
Using ethnicity data collected from 
communities within a five-minute 
catchment area of our gyms, we 
established how reflective our 
workforce is of the communities 
we serve. Within Gym Support, 
those identifying as Black, African 
and Caribbean increased by 2.3 
percentage points compared with 
2021. Across Gym Operations, whilst 
those identifying as ethnically white 
increased by 1.8% percentage points 
from 2021, overall ethnic diversity 
remains broadly above census data 
and in line with catchment data. 
However, we are aware that Asian 
employees are currently under 
represented; more work is required to 
understand reasons for this trend. 2022 2021 2020 2019Senior leaders gender balance

global warming to 1.5°C. 
Our sustainability strategy 
acknowledges this and sets 
out our responsibility to

Our road to net zero
Our stated commitment to net zero 
was accepted by Science Based 
Targets initiative (‘SBTi’) in March 
2022, and we have now made our full 
submission; this defines our pathway 
to net zero in compliance with the 
latest science based standards and 
guidelines. As part of this process, we 
have extended our Scope 3 emissions 
boundary to include all materially 
relevant activities, as well as restating 
and aligning our baseline year of 2019.
Our level of ambition has not changed, 
and we remain committed to 
decarbonising our estate of Scope 1 and 
2 emissions by 2035. However, alignment 
with our Scope 3 emissions trajectory 
determines a SBTi net zero target of 
2045. We recognise emission reductions 
are only a part of achieving net zero. Our carbon

Our wider climate-related targets are 
outlined below and we will review these

our net zero plan.
Our GHG emissions reporting in 2020 
and 2021 was significantly impacted 
by Covid-19 restrictions and was 
therefore not representative of our 
typical performance. As published in 
our Annual Report 2021 on page 45, 
our Scope 1 emissions in that year 
were 1,282 tCO2e and Scope 2  
6,420 tCO2e. Owing to materially 
lower levels of activity than usual, 
we have chosen not to restate these 
years, and we will report against 
our 2019 baseline going forward 
to demonstrate progress towards 
our net zero commitment. Our 2022 
emissions are stated in line with this 
revised operational boundary for 
direct comparison.1 From a 2019 baseline.

achieve the absolute long term target of 90% reduction for Scope 1, 2, and 3.Abatement  
We will develop our plan to 
remove and store carbon from 
the atmosphere. This will serve 
to offset the impact of our

and reduction
A volatile energy market has been 
a feature of 2022, and there have 
been significant increases in utility 
costs that remain into 2023, and 
beyond. The increasing cost of 
energy, combined with the need for 
net zero, makes energy reduction 
and management more important 
than ever.
Across the UK, we have a team 
of specialist Facilities Managers 
(‘FMs’) who maintain a consistently 
high standard across our gyms. In 2022, we undertook detailed 
energy measurement, monitoring 
and reporting at several sites. Our 
energy reporting is now being built 
into a centralised system to allow full 
visibility, both centrally and locally, 
of all sites. We also introduced a 
standardised energy audit that FMs 
now complete each year at every site. 
The energy audit seeks to identify any 
issues that may be driving excessive 
energy consumption. Examples 
of when we successfully reduced 
our energy use are found in the 
below table: 
The issue The solution The outcome
Air handling 
unit controls  
An anomaly with 
the control system 
on our air handling 
units resulted in the 
unit running at high 
speed overnight.Corrected so that the units 
are run at approximately 
50% capacity at periods of 
low occupation.
We produced a training 
video on the correct 
configuration for all 
engineers to prevent  
any reoccurrence.Applied to 100 sites, this 
initiative would deliver 
a carbon reduction of 
approximately 46 tCO2  
per year.
Lighting 
upgrade  
Prior to 2016, all our 
sites were fitted with 
T5 fluorescent lamps, 
with LED lighting 
introduced in May 
2016.Completion of our lighting 
replacement programme 
in 2022, with all gyms now 
operating LED lighting. 
Reduction of power 
consumption on a like-
for-like basis and fewer 
lamps needed due to the 
improved output.Reduced energy and  
power consumption on  
a continuous basis.
Replacing 20,000 T5 
lamps with LED will deliver 
a carbon reduction of 
approximately 2,000 tCO2  
per year.
Air conditioning 
systems and 
temperature 
control  
With record breaking 
high temperatures 
this summer, the 
demand on our air 
conditioning was 
significant.On World Environment 
Day we launched our ‘20 is 
Plenty’ campaign to ensure 
gyms were operating at no 
lower than 20oC .
We also continued to 
rollout and develop our 
remote monitoring and 
control systems for air 
conditioning.Published studies vary,  
but it is generally reported 
that increasing the air 
conditioning temperature 
by 1oC can save 5–10% of 
running costs.
Data logging and remote 
access enhance our 
understanding and lead 
to optimisation of energy 
consuming systems.

Low carbon technology
We have continued to rollout our 
hot water systems using air source 
heat pump (‘ASHP’) technology. Last 
year, working in partnership with our 
key suppliers, we developed a highly 
efficient system that incorporates 
carbon dioxide (‘CO2‘) as the 
refrigerant with a global warming 
potential of just 1.0. We are now able 
to successfully generate hot water 
using this method at all new sites 
and currently operate 30 sites using 
ASHP , removing the need for gas fired 
boilers. We will actively replace old 
gas fired systems with ASHP as they 
reach their end of life, supporting our 
pathway to net zero. 
To further support our net zero 
roadmap, we are installing 
photovoltaic solar panels to generate 
local onsite power. Typically, up to Emissions year ended 31 December

30% of our gym’s power requirements 
can be met by onsite solar panels, and 
we are able to consume up to 100% 
of the power generated, avoiding 
emissions of over 35 tCO2e per year 
for a typical gym. We have already 
completed detailed site appraisals at 
several sites and are in discussion with 
landlords to agree the installation.
We will continue to make capital 
investments to reduce energy 
consumption in 2023. Due to the 
increased energy costs, capital 
investments will have a reduced 
payback period and improved return 
on investment. We will explore further 
opportunities as they arise, including 
investment in low carbon technologies 
and energy-saving initiatives.Waste management
2022 marked the start of our  
initiative to extend the lifespan of  
our gym equipment. We kicked off  
a programme to remanufacture and 
overhaul kit within our aged estate 
to extend the lifespan of our core 
product offering. Machines have  
been taken from existing gyms  
to create a baseline stock holding,  
which can then be repurposed 
elsewhere within the estate, shifting 
the balance from ‘remove and  
replace’ to ‘remanufacture and 
recycle’. Any kit that cannot be 
remanufactured is responsibly 
recycled through our buy 
back programme.
Throughout 2022, we gradually 
reduced the volume of blue roll 
cleaning tissue used by members 
in our gyms as the intense Covid-19 
cleaning regimes relaxed. By 
modifying member communications 
and reducing the number of cleaning 
stations in each site, we observed a 
lower volume of waste without any negative response from members 
or impact on the cleanliness 
of equipment. 
As well as reducing the amount of 
waste generated, we have reduced 
the number of waste collections, 
which has subsequently eliminated 
transport and handling emissions. 
This has resulted in a reduction of 32% 
in our overall waste (by weight) in the 
second half of 2022. Landfill diversion 
has remained consistent with 2021, 
seeing 95% of our waste being recycled 
or sent to waste to energy plants.
2022 has seen a full year of waste 
generation compared with the nine 
months of operation in 2021, with new 
gyms also adding to the total amount 
generated. Against this background, 
the amount of waste generated 
per gym has remained the same, 
and after adjusting for the closure 
period in 2021, we witnessed a gross 
reduction in total waste by 19%.Water management
We concluded our estate-wide water 
audit in 2022. Only eight sites were 
identified as having issues, all of 
which were quickly remedied. We 
have also installed data loggers with 
remote monitoring to capture water 
consumption data at several sites.  
We will evaluate the findings in the first 
half of 2023 to gain greater insight 
into our water consumption and 
establish an ongoing monitoring and 
targeting system. 
As we do not operate any pools, 
sauna, steam rooms or similar wet 
facilities, toilet and wash facilities 
are the main water use. Most of our 
gyms are equipped with low water 
volume shower heads to reduce 
consumption, and we have identified 
up to 80 locations where replacing 
the original showers can reduce water 
consumption by over 30%. This work 
is ongoing and will be completed in 
2023, with the potential to save over 
half a million litres of water a week. 2022 carbon emissions
Our Scope 1 direct emissions for this 
year are 2,138 tCO2e, resulting from the 
direct combustion of 10,960,970 kWh of 
natural gas. Both 2019 and 2022 now 
include emissions resulting from loss of 
refrigerants. This represents a carbon 
decrease of 1% from 2019.
Scope 2 indirect emissions for this 
year are 7 ,633 tCO2e, resulting from 
the consumption of 39,435,614 kWh of 
electricity and 38,880 kWh of direct 
heat, purchased and consumed in  
day-to-day business operations.  
This represents a carbon decrease  
of 13% from 2019.
Our operations have an intensity 
metric of 203 tCO2e per gym and 
871 tCO2e per million visits for this 
reporting year. This represents a 
reduction in operational carbon 
intensity by 1.5% and an increase of 
11% respectively from our base year.
Our emissions have been calculated 
utilising location based emission 
factors, as published by the 
Department for Business, Energy 
and Industrial Strategy. Due to the 
renewable electricity procurement 
contract that we have had in place 
since 2019, should we utilise market-
based emissions factors to calculate 
carbon emissions, our Scope 2 would 
reduce by 6,002 tCO2e.Strategic

Our progress on TCFD
At The Gym Group, we are committed 
to tackling both the immediate and 
long term impacts of climate change 
on our business and the communities 
we serve. This year marks our 
second year of reporting against 
TCFD. We are proud to have made 
progress against the disclosures 
over the past year: comprehensively 
reviewing our climate-related risks 
and opportunities; evaluating 
qualitative financial impacts on the 
business; and completing our first submission to Carbon Disclosure 
Project (‘CDP’). In 2023, we will 
continue to work towards meeting

Consistent with TCFD, climate-related physical risks were then categorised as follows: 
 l Acute physical risks: event-driven risks, including increased severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, 
floods and heat waves.
 l Chronic physical risks: longer term shifts in climate patterns (e.g. sustained higher temperatures) that may cause sea 
level rise or chronic heat waves.
The selected transition climate scenarios, as defined by The Energy Transition Risks & Opportunities (ET Risk) research 
consortium, are outlined on page 53.Our Chief Development and 
Sustainability Officer, David Melhuish, 
continues to lead the management 
and oversight of The Gym Group’s 
sustainability strategy and is 
responsible for monitoring and 
overseeing our climate-related 
progress. As outlined within the 
Committee’s terms of reference, this 
includes, but is not limited to, reviewing 
progress against our goals and 
targets to achieve net zero (see pages 
90-91) and managing physical and 
transition risks through our identified 
control measures (see Principal risks 
and uncertainties, pages 54-63). Last 
year, through the Committee and our 
focused ESG workstream, we added 
an ESG-related metric to the annual 
Executive bonus.
Strategy
Our process for managing climate-
related impacts is embedded in the 
responsibility to the environment pillar of our sustainability strategy and we 
strive to be at the forefront of  
best practice within the health and 
fitness industry. As a business, we have 
pledged to decarbonise our Scope 1 
and 2 emissions by 2035, and become 
net zero by 2045, against a 2019 base 
year. We have successfully submitted 
our net zero trajectory to the SBTi.
Last year, we worked with an 
independent sustainability 
consultancy to assess the resilience of 
our strategy against climate change. 
We undertook climate scenario 
modelling and identified two distinct 
transition and physical scenarios to 
assess our UK business operations. 
The selected scenarios present a 
sharp contrast between potential 
futures, which allows us to plan for a 
range of possible manifesting climate 
impacts, such as the likelihood of flood 
risk at future site selection. To identify climate impacts, we 
adopted three time horizons: 
short term (2030), medium term 
(2050) and long term (2080). The 
time horizons use the Met Office’s 
UKCP18 Projections as the basis for 
the physical risk identification. To 
ensure a consistent approach, the 
same timeframes were selected for 
the transition risk identification. In 
the short term, alignment with the 
current business strategy presents 
the milestone for risk and opportunity 
materialisation. The UK Government’s 
net zero target date and the typical 
lifespan of our assets (including our 
buildings) presents the milestone for 
the medium term; whilst the long term 
time horizons directly mirrors the 
physical scenario.
The two physical climate scenarios 
chosen, as defined by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, are outlined below.
Transition  
climate  
scenariosAmbitious climate 
transitionAn optimistic scenario in line with a 2°C temperature increase where technological 
solutions drive the low carbon economy forwards.
Limited climate  
transitionA conservative scenario in line with a 3–4°C temperature increase where policy 
interventions continue as usual and global climate targets and commitments  
are not reached.
Consistent with TCFD, climate-related transition risks were then categorised as Policy and legal, Market, Technology  
and Reputation.
The most significant risks are summarised on page 53. Through the scenario analysis, RCP8.5 is recognised as the 
scenario in which the identified physical risks are the most significant. By contrast, the identified transition risk and 
climate opportunity are most significant under the RCP4.5 scenario. TCFD risk

As set out in the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section on pages 54-63, 
the Group’s principal risk register 
is made up of those strategic risks 
and functional risks that are believed 
would have the greatest impact 
on operations. The risk register is 
reviewed twice yearly by the SMT and 
discussed with the Audit and Risk 
Committee. This process ensures that 
actual and potential climate-related 
impacts are controlled, mitigated 
or transferred as appropriate, 
and integrated into business 
decision making. Metrics and targets
As a business, we are committed to 
significantly reducing our Scope 1, 2 
and 3 greenhouse gas emissions in 
accordance with the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol Standard. Our 2022 carbon 
footprint and metrics relating to 
energy, water and waste can be found 
on pages 48-49.
We have now submitted our net zero 
commitment for validation to SBTi. In 
line with the SBTi requirements, we are 
developing our pathway with a near 
term target of 50% reduction by 2030, 
and a long term target of net zero by 
2045 against a base year of 2019.Risk management
We assess climate impacts through 
our TCFD risk and opportunity 
register and communicate the 
findings to our management team, 
Executive Committee and the Board. 
Our TCFD register assesses both the 
impact and likelihood of each climate-
related financial impact, and outlines 
current and future control measures. 
We have identified a significance 
threshold for escalating climate 
risks and opportunities, and have 
introduced this into our group-wide 
risk register as an emerging risk. The Gym Group plc
