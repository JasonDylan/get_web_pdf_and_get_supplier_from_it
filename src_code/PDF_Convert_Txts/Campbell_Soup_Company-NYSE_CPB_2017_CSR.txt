DENISE M. MORRISON
Dear Campbell Stakeholders,
As we at Campbell strive to live into our Purpose — Real food that matters for 
life’s moments — we are committed to earning your trust through transparency, 
sustainability, and real food. 
But what exactly is “real food”? 
Influenced by the proud legacy of our founder, Dr. John 
Dorrance, and guided by our Purpose , in 2016 we boldly 
defined our Real Food Philosophy, grounded in three 
simple principles:
•  Real food has roots. It should be made with 
recognizable, desirable ingredients from plants  
and animals. 
•  Real food is prepared with care. It should be crafted 
using ethical sourcing and sustainable practices that 
safeguard the natural resources we all share. 
•  Real food should be accessible to all. It should always be delicious, safe, and available at a fair price — all three without compromise. 
We've already made significant progress —  from working 
to eliminate artificial colors and flavors in our foods, BPA in our packaging, and antibiotics in our chicken supply, 
to adding vegetables and whole grains, and blazing the 
trail to support mandatory national GMO labeling. We’re also embracing transparency from farm to family through 
initiatives such as our whatsinmyfood website, where 
we provide detailed information about what goes into our food, how we make our food, and the choices 
behind the ingredients we use. To truly activate our Real Food Philosophy and become 
a Purpose-driven organization with innovation at the 
helm, we also have addressed what seems to be another 
simple question — what do we value?
The Values we unveiled this year are not really new. They 
represent what our company and our people have always stood for. And, they preserve the best elements of our 
existing culture and the cultures of the companies that 
have joined our family. They are:
•  Do Right and Be Real. Always act with integrity.
•  Seek the Power of Different. Be open and curious, 
and listen for the unexpected.
•  Dare to Disrupt. Experiment fast to learn sooner.
•  Own it Like a Founder. Act as if your name is on it, 
and wear your passion on your sleeve. 
For nearly 150 years, Campbell has made real food and real experiences that connect our consumers to each 
other and to the world around them. While it's not listed on any label, trust may be the most important ingredient 
in our food. People trust us to provide foods and drinks 
that are good, honest, authentic and flavorful — made from ingredients that are grown, prepared and cooked 
or baked with care. They also expect us to be socially Strategy

their values and beliefs, and make a difference in  
the world —  in short, to be authentic and open. 
That's why we are working to set the standard for 
transparency, with the goal of becoming the world’s 
most trusted food company. Our Values are the 
heart and soul of our organization, and our people are rallying around the related behaviors in our 
relentless effort to grow, innovate and maintain  
that trust.
This era of transparency gives us a fabulous 
opportunity to connect with our consumers in a whole new way, and I thank you for your interest  
in our company, and our commitment to corporate 
responsibility, sustainability, and transparency. 
As you read through this report, I hope you’ll catch 
the spirit of our excitement around how our Purpose , 
our Real Food Philosophy and our Values are motivating 
us to drive real change, to make bold moves, and to 
challenge our thinking. We're inspired by our heritage, 
clear-eyed about today’s challenges, and focused on tomorrow as we define the future of real food. It won't 
be easy, but it's the right thing to do for consumers, our 
company, our shareholders, and our planet.
Best,
Denise M. Morrison

STRATEGY  |  14Taking a Fresh Approach 
Running a responsible food business begins at the farm and 
ends at the table, but every detail in between matters to us. We must leverage our Purpose at all points along our value chain — making Real food that matters for life’s moments the 
filter for all of our decision making. Our key strategies set 
forth in FY2015 included plans to drive deeper transparency 
into how our foods and beverages are made in an effort to build greater consumer trust and to increase our focus on health, well-being, fresh and better-for-you products.
Consumers demand greater transparency, which supports 
both a resilient supply chain and resilient healthy communities where we live and work. Our consumers trust us to govern ourselves in a way that will reliably bring our products to their table for their own moments that matter — in a way that is not simply conscious of profit, but also of our impact on the planet and people. 
For this reason, we put corporate responsibility (CR) and 
sustainability at the heart of our Purpose and core business strategies. At Campbell, we define CR and sustainability as advancing global nutrition and wellness; helping build a more sustainable environment; and honoring our role in society, from the farm to the family. 
To ensure that we held ourselves accountable to our Purpose , 
in FY2016 we conducted our annual formal strategic planning 
process. The practice allows us to take a step back each year and reassess and refine our core strategies, including CR, sustainability and community affairs. This process, coupled with stakeholder engagement and a broad assessment of key external drivers in the marketplace, helps to inform business-wide and individual performance goals for the coming year.
Our strategic plan for CR and sustainability rests on four 
key pillars:
• Environmental stewardship;• Engaging with our customers and consumers;• Community impact; and• Building a high-performance workplace.
Setting the Bar High for CR Governance 
Our formalized governance structure helps us to successfully 
integrate CR and sustainability into our everyday operations. This structure begins with the support of our CEO and oversight by our Board of Directors, and flows down into the culture of Campbell’s workforce leadership and management.With nearly nine years of a formalized CR and sustainability program under our belt, we continue to make strides  
in the way we manage and oversee CR-related decisions and strategies across the enterprise. Our Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability, Dave Stangis, is responsible for leading our global CR and sustainability strategies. Dave reports to President and CEO Denise Morrison. Annual updates on CR and sustainability are also provided to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
Recently, we improved our sustainability governance 
structure by redesigning our Sustainability Leadership Team and moving to a Sustainability Leadership Network with oversight from a Sustainability Steering Committee. The Network is a cross-functional team consisting of leaders in sustainable agriculture, environmental engineering, packaging, procurement and supply chain. 
The Network is responsible for developing short- and 
long-term goals, strengthening metrics and providing quarterly updates to the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is composed of senior leaders from each of our operating divisions as well as from global engineering, corporate responsibility, global procurement, research  
and development and supply chain. 
At the end of the day, however, it is the many Campbell 
employees who work day in and day out to bring our  CR and sustainability strategy to life, through formal job assignments as well as participation in our plant facility green teams and various volunteer initiatives.  Strategy

STRATEGY  |  16Proactive, consistent stakeholder engagement with a variety 
of internal and external audiences is critical to implementing an effective CR and sustainability strategy. Along with the wide reach we have as an industry-leading company comes an immense responsibility to be a good listener to those who are impacted by our business operations. Each 
of our stakeholders, at all points along the value chain, 
warrants regular dialogue on the issues and concerns that 
are top of mind for them. These discussions and continued collaborations provide us with perspectives that then inform our strategic priorities and help to build a 
competitive advantage. We make sure to have a range of 
touchpoints with stakeholders throughout the year, 
including meetings, conferences, roundtable discussions, interviews and surveys. 
Our three-pronged approach to stakeholder engagement 
includes identifying issues that are most important to  
our stakeholders; setting processes for meaningful and effective engagement; and benchmarking for leadership performance within and outside our sector. Beyond engagement, we make it a priority to respond to the issues identified through our thorough stakeholder efforts. We do so through various collaborative measures, including creative public-private partnerships, CEO engagement in industry and CR organizations, and through our Scientific Advisors.

STRATEGY  |  17Health and Nutrition Stakeholder Engagement  
& Research 
Many of today’s complex nutrition issues require a 
collaborative and multidisciplinary approach to solutions that span the public and private sectors. As an industry leader, Campbell established a legacy in performing and 
supporting health and nutrition research, education and 
consumer programs to improve consumer diets through 
innovative partnerships with stakeholders that in 2016 included:
•  Participation in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics 
Nutrition Impact Summit. The invitation only event was 
convened by the Academy and its Foundation to explore 
collaborative opportunities to accelerate progress toward good health and well-being for all people.
•  Sponsoring and exhibiting at the Academy of Nutrition 
and Dietetics’ annual Food and Nutrition Conference & Expo (FNCE), where our corporate nutritionists get feedback on our products from health professionals.
•  Supporting the Produce for Better Health Foundation, as 
a donor, on the Board of Trustees, through participation in the marketing and communications and research subcommittees and through sponsorship of their annual meeting. These efforts support Campbell’s Nutrition strategy (specific to fruits and vegetables) and Real Food mission and help educate key stakeholders on Campbell’s nutrition initiatives.
•  Involvement in planning symposia for the American 
Society for Nutrition and engaging the organization  
to stay up-to-date on research from top nutrition scientists in industry and academia.
•  Collaborating with retailer health and wellness programs 
through the development of nutrition education resources, including recipes that aligned with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, coupon and recipe booklets, nutrition articles and more to educate consumers about healthy eating.
•  Providing continuing education credits to over  
200 dietitians on culinary trends and nutrition 
communications.
•  Collaborating with global industry on the Consumer Goods Forum to develop programs and share best practices in health and wellness promotion.
•  Conducting an annual survey of dietitians to collect feedback on our products, clients’ consumption and referral habits, nutritional characteristics of products and resources they seek for consumers.•  Sustaining Arnott’s partnership with the Dietitians 
Association of Australia (DAA), the governing body of dietetic and nutrition professionals in Australia, through 
which Arnott’s supports professional development. 
•  Arnott's formed a new partnership with Dietitian 
Connection, an online network of dietitians. Through 
this partnership, Arnott's engages with nutrition professionals and encourages dialogue on the latest 
nutrition science and trends.
•  Continued engagement with the Interfaith Center on 
Corporate Responsibility on public health issues, 
including obesity, undernutrition and access to nutrition.
•  Participation in the Access to Nutrition Index assessment, 
which ranks the world’s largest food companies on 
their efforts in tackling nutrition challenges. Campbell 
uses the report to help inform nutrition strategy and 
best practices in policy development, transparency and communication on nutrition issues.
Campbell’s Scientific Advisors 
Our Scientific Advisors are made up of respected food 
and nutrition scientists from leading universities and 
private organizations across the globe. These nutrition gurus provide us with an outside look and fresh perspective on how Campbell can improve the health 
credentials of our products. Engaging with our senior 
leadership, brand and research and development teams, 
our advisors keep us up to speed on emerging nutrition issues and how we can formulate and process our products to integrate those new health benefits.
In December 2016, we engaged our Scientific Advisors for 
a third-party review of our nutrition strategy and health 
and wellness reporting as benchmarked against key competitors. The purpose of the review was to validate existing measures of progress and to help inform future 
strategy. We will report on the results of this review in our 
FY2017 report.Strategy

Strategy
In order to help Campbell identify and prioritize our 
most relevant issues related to CR and sustainability, we conducted an in-depth materiality assessment in FY2016. This process allowed us to better understand how the priorities and concerns of external stakeholders align with our business priorities and CR objectives. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Reporting Guidelines mandate that organizations do a materiality assessment as part of their reporting process to inform what are the most critical — or “material” — issues to report. 
Campbell defines CR material issues as those that 
influence the judgment and decisions of our external and internal stakeholders and have an impact on our stakeholders and business today and in the future. In order to identify the key issues of importance, we seek the input of a variety of stakeholder groups and measure the risks and opportunities for all relevant environmental, social and governance topics. Our goal in this process is to help inform our overall CR and sustainability strategies, set priorities and ensure that our annual CR Report communicates how we are managing those material issues.
Our assessment adhered to the following steps:
Step 1: Identification of Issues
We reviewed publicly available CR communications of 
our peer set, including CR reports, press releases and corporate websites, to analyze what CR issues and initiatives currently are of priority across our industry. We then conducted a thorough media audit of trade, CR and mainstream media outlets to understand what issues are trending and of the highest concern in the news. We also had conversations with various NGOs, investors and CR organizations to confirm our findings. 
Step 2: Stakeholder Survey
We organized a widespread survey of global employees, customers (retailers), suppliers, NGOs, community partners, government or regulatory agencies, investors, trade organizations and consumers. The survey was not only sent directly to targeted external stakeholders, but was also posted publicly on Twitter and LinkedIn to gather input from as varied an audience as possible. In total, we received responses from more than 1,250 survey participants.Step 3: Stakeholder Interviews
To further vet the issues and rankings as identified by the survey results, we conducted detailed stakeholder interviews. Sustainable Brands interviewed five internal stakeholders, while Business for Social Responsibility 
interviewed five external stakeholders. In addition, we 
did post-survey interviews internally with more than  
60 employees globally and 12 external stakeholders. 
Our stakeholders were asked to rate the importance 
of each of the following issues identified in our initial 
materiality research, including: 
Responsible Business Practices
• Transparency: Communicating openly with 
stakeholders on material issues and being clear with 
customers and consumers about what is in our food and where it comes from.
• Responsible Sourcing Practices: Addressing issues in 
the supply chain, including human rights, workplace safety, being capable of fully tracing product inputs to their supply source, and full traceability of product inputs in our supply chain.
• Sustainable Business Models: Doing business in a 
way that increases the size of the business while simultaneously reducing our environmental footprint and increasing positive social impact.
• Business Ethics: Upholding ethical principles in the 
business and workplace, including consumer privacy, fraud, bribery, corruption and corporate governance.
• Public Policy and Engagement: Actively engaging in 
public policy on issues affecting our industry.
Society
• Health, Nutrition and Wellness: Improving the health 
profile of our products and engaging in public 
discussions on healthy and nutritious lifestyles.
• Animal Welfare: Ensuring the ethical treatment of 
animals in our value chain.
• Food Access: Ensuring wholesome, nutritional food 
is available to as many people as possible in an affordable manner.
• Community Involvement: Improving the communities 
in which we live and work through philanthropic efforts, including donations, volunteerism and other community programming.
• Human Rights in the Supply Chain: Combatting 
child labor and forced labor in the supply chain and evaluating our suppliers in the area of human rights.MATERIALITY

Step 4: Validation
Campbell’s CR Steering Committee met to review the 
findings and validate the issues. These issues were then presented to various company leaders who also provided their input on the importance of these issues to Campbell’s overall company strategies. 
Based on the results of these steps, we created a 
materiality grid, which maps where our long-term business success aligns with marketplace and stakeholder priorities. We will utilize these findings to identify and validate opportunities for strengthening our CR and sustainability strategy and reporting in the future.

Why It MattersMaterial Issue
HEALTH, NUTRITION & AWARENESS
Products
Our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments — guides how we think about nutrition and health. It is our 
North Star amidst today’s dramatically shifting food landscape. As a key voice in the food industry, we must ensure that our products are relevant and meet the expectations of our nutrition-savvy consumers, who are increasingly demanding healthier and fresher food with minimal artificial ingredients and processing. 
It is imperative for Campbell to stay abreast of changes in food and nutrition to better understand how we can 
provide our customers with the healthy food they desire and thus identify the opportunities we have for growth. In 2016, the food world continued to shift in unprecedented ways. These changes are reshaping the way food is grown, made, marketed, sold and consumed. In turn, an evolving food and nutrition landscape is fundamentally altering the way we think, talk and act about our products. We know that if we don’t evolve with these trends, we will not be able to thrive as a food company. Some of the trends influencing our food and nutrition strategy are:
Rise in Chronic Diseases
 
According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, rates of chronic diseases related to poor-quality 
diet and physical inactivity have increased, with half of all U.S. adults having one or more preventable, diet-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overweight and obesity. 
Heightened Consumer Interest in Fresh and Healthy Foods
Consumer interest in health and wellness is growing as they recognize the role diet plays in health and well-being. 
They are demanding healthier, more “real foods,” which we believe is food made with recognizable and desirable ingredients. Consumers are increasingly seeking fresh, natural or organic products and those made with ingredients they recognize. They are telling us to avoid artificial preservatives, colors and flavors and are seeking products with vegetables, whole grains and other components associated with good health. 
Intersection of Health and Technology
We refer to the increased fusion of health and technology as society becoming “wired for well-being,” and it will 
have a profound impact on consumers’ food choices. People will soon make decisions about what to eat or what

How We Manage
Evolving food trends and a consumer demand for 
transparency influenced us to take a step back and give our nutrition strategy a refresh. In FY2015, we outlined our new corporate Strategic Imperatives, which included expanding our business in the areas of packaged fresh and well-being. To help meet our new Strategic Imperatives, we implemented a major restructuring of the company. By reorganizing our business to prioritize food categories rather than regions, health and well-being became even more embedded into our products and overall corporate responsibility strategy. We will continue to accelerate growth in our Campbell Fresh division and expand into new categories in the packaged fresh category, as evidenced by our acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
We aspire, with this new approach, to make Campbell 
even more synonymous with real and better-for-you foods in the future. Moving forward, Campbell will continue to evolve its health and wellness strategies and policies to reflect these consumer demands. Currently, we are doing this by:
• measuring our progress;
• expanding our healthy product portfolio; and• engaging and educating our consumers.not to eat based on individual needs. Consumers are already leading “quantified lives” — tracking their activities  
and fitness through “wearables” that measure aspects of their overall health. The emerging trend in this area is bio-
monitoring. We’re seeing it in health care and medicine, and it is only a matter of time before it impacts the food industry. In the future, consumers will no longer wonder about the “right food” for them because bio-sensors will  
scan their metabolism and recommend the “right” diets.
Our consumers are also increasingly using digital tools to shop and share their opinions about food. People love to 
socialize about the food they cook, shop for and eat. They take photos of their food and share, like and comment on their friends’ experiences through social media. This creates interesting opportunities for Campbell that we’re actively exploring.
Consumer Demand for Greater Transparency
Consumers today are savvy and have greater expectations of food companies to disclose how and where their food 
is made, which ingredients are used and how those ingredients are produced and sourced. In its 2015 Global Annual Review, PwC cited food integrity and transparency as one of four colliding megatrends, noting: “High profile  
contamination, adulteration and fraud incidents in the US, Europe and Asia have eroded public trust in the food industry, raising consumer awareness of food quality and ensuing safety risks. There is growing demand for higher quality food and transparency of food ingredients, origins and production processes, especially among the world’s growing urban middle class.” Products

Our Progress
In order to ensure that our products reflect the latest 
nutrition science and consumer demands, we lean on the expertise of our nutrition and health experts, stakeholders and partners to find better-for-you product solutions. We are constantly seeking ways to improve the nutritional value of our food and beverages so that we can, in turn, help people improve their diets and meet their personal health goals. To do this, Campbell seeks to reduce the nutrients or ingredients of concern in our products such as saturated fats, sodium, sugar and artificial ingredients. At the same time, we pursue positive nutrition by increasing vegetables, whole grains, and other food components or nutrients under consumed in the diet.
Measuring Progress
We know that this is a journey, and we must set goals 
and make progress against them each year. Since 2010, 
we have measured our progress by making continuous 
improvements in the sales of better-for-you products. To track our progress against these goals, we evaluate the nutrition of our products globally against government and other scientifically accepted criteria.Products
Offering a Portfolio of Healthy Options 
Campbell believes that consumers should have options from which to choose, especially when it comes to better-  
for-you products. We are committed to promoting and encouraging healthy eating by creating products that are not only nutritious, but affordable, and meet the local and regional tastes and customs of our diverse customer base.
In FY2016, we brought consumers even more variety to 
the grocery store shelf, including: 
•  Expanding our organic kid’s soup offerings to include 
Organic Mega Noodle Soup, Organic Disney® Frozen  
Cool Shapes Soup, and Organic Chicken & Stars Soup.
•  Removing high fructose corn syrup from all fresh bakery products.
•  Simplifying the recipes for all our Healthy Kids soups to remove ingredients like MSG and other ingredients consumers do not want in their food and relaunched the soups in cans without BPA. These soups are joined by two new healthy additions: Star Wars® Condensed Cool Shapes soup with limited edition labels and Cool Star Wars®-themed pasta.
•  Launching new flavors in our Oven, Skillet and Slow Cooker sauce lines that can be used in the development of healthy recipes.
•  Introducing Unsalted Swanson®  beef and chicken broths.
•  Launching a number of healthy products in single-serving 
containers to increase the convenience of healthy foods. These include: V8® Low Sodium in two new pack sizes,  
5.5 and 11.5 oz; V8® Essential Antioxidants, 5.5 oz; and  four V8® Veggie Blends, Carrot Mango, Healthy Greens, Purple Power and Golden Goodness — in 12-oz single-serve bottles as well as several 12-oz bottles of V8 V-Fusion® juices.

CRITERIA PROGRESS
Government criteria for “healthy” foods$2.9 billion, or approximately 28 percent, of total gross sales of foods met the definition of “healthy,” defined as those foods with nutritional profiles satisfying the FDA and other globally accepted criteria. These sales declined $31 million as compared to FY2015.
Efforts to reduce or limit 
nutrients that, in excess, may 
contribute to negative health 
outcomes$5.7 billion, or approximately 55 percent, of total gross sales were generated by products brought to market that are lower in calories, saturated fat, trans fats, 
sodium and/or total sugars. This represents a 2 percent increase as compared 
to FY2015 driven by our Real Food reformulation agenda and acquisition of 
Garden Fresh Gourmet.
The contribution of our foods 
to a healthful diet through the provision of food groups or nutrients that are under consumed in the diet$3.3 billion, or 32 percent, of total gross sales of consumer products  globally made a positive contribution to the diet through servings of fruits and vegetables or were a good source of fiber, vitamins, or minerals. This number is flat to FY2015 globally although international sales of these products increased by $29 million.

Engaging and Educating Our Consumers 
We believe we have a responsibility to engage and inform our 
consumers about health and nutrition as it relates to our products so they can make food decisions that are good for their health and the well-being of their families. To help them make informed decisions, 
we present our consumers with a variety of tools and resources — 
on-package, online and through other communication channels. 
Most importantly, when a product is in hand, we ensure that 
the item contains simple language or obvious markers to help consumers identify health criteria. Consumers can also feel 
confident that any health claim made on the label is backed by 
stringent criteria developed by federal agencies and third-party 
experts. For instance, all of our U.S. products claiming to be “healthy” are required to meet the FDA nutritional criteria. 
In 2016, we continued to engage with consumers in a number 
of ways to empower them with nutritional know-how and meal 
planning tools, including:
• A weekly Meal-Mail® newsletter electronically delivers meal ideas 
and recipes to more than 650,000 busy U.S. consumers. 
• Campbell’s Kitchen®  website (www.campbellskitchen.com)  
offers consumers quick, easy, delicious recipes along with 
timesaving tips and coupon savings. 
• Cook with Campbell’s®  website (www.cookwithcampbells.ca) 
connects to over 4 million on-the-go Canadian consumers with simple meal planning and preparation ideas. It also offers a monthly Meal-Mail®  with recipes for 160,000 consumers.
• Ideas for Innovation website (www.campbellideas.com)  
gives employees, consumers, customers, suppliers, contractors, inventors and friends the opportunity to share their ideas with us, including how to improve the health and nutrition of our products.
• Campbell’s Online Nutrition Portal ( www.campbellnutrition.com) 
provides influencers and engaged consumers (over 140,000 in FY2016) the inside scoop on the nutritional attributes of our products, and provides educational resources that align with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Health professionals and consumers are able to search Campbell’s® products by beneficial nutrients, dietary restrictions and nutritional needs,  or by brand or product name.
We also always welcome the feedback of our consumers, and our Consumer Affairs team reviews and addresses all inquiries, whether it is through our surveys, toll-free telephone number, letters, emails, social media engagement using @CampbellCares or our “Chat with Us” feature on our corporate website.Products
IMPLEMENTING HEALTH RATINGS  DOWN UNDER
As part of our global commitment to health and 
wellness and a long-standing history of providing our consumers with clear nutrition information to help inform choices, our Arnott’s® brand, one of Australia’s largest biscuit and snack producers, has begun progressively implementing a voluntary Health Star Rating (HSR) that was approved by the Australian Federal Government in June 2014. We are currently determining the best way to integrate the HSR system with existing on-pack information across the entire Arnott’s range, but products displaying the HSR are already starting to appear on shelf. 
LISTENING TO CONSUMERS’ NEEDS
There are many small decisions that go into each and every purchase in the average American household. As a food company making items and ingredients found on store shelves, it is our job to understand what consumers want in a healthy food product  and how they find what they’re looking for, as well as anticipating what they might want next. 
Our Consumer and Customer Insights Department 
(CCID) does just that: they listen to and spend time with our consumers to understand their lives and their needs. CCID’s research helps us create healthy, nutritious products that best fit consumers’ lives and communicate with them in a way that makes sense to each individual’s personal journey, from what they’ll have for dinner, to what they’ll snack on during the day, and what they may plan to eat next week.
By understanding and immersing themselves 
into these consumers’ lives, CCID can identify meaningful and lasting ways to connect them with Campbell’s brands, and those insights can help fuel innovation. In order to make products that continue to meet changing tastes and needs around nutrition, our team is focused on knowing consumers in each part of their journey at every stage of the day — especially before they get to the last-minute question of “what do you want to eat?”

A Real Food Journey
In FY2015, we began our real food journey with our  
Purpose , Real food that matters for life’s moments . Since 
then, we’ve made progress on this journey, and in FY2016 we outlined how our real food philosophy is changing 
the way we think about our food and setting the standard 
for transparency in the food industry. We are documenting 
our progress toward moving away from BPA lining, MSG, high fructose corn syrup, artificial preservatives,
1 and 
flavors. We are also working to source antibiotic-free chicken, remove artificial sweeteners and eliminate other ingredients that consumers do not want. Not only are we removing ingredients from our foods that consumers don’t want, but we are also gearing up to make commitments around including more foods they DO  
want in FY2017.
Extending Our Packaged Fresh Options 
We continue to grow our better-for-you portfolio through strategic acquisitions. In 2015 we acquired Garden Fresh Gourmet, another milestone in our efforts to increase  our presence and sales in the packaged fresh category. Garden Fresh Gourmet makes the number-one branded refrigerated salsa in the U.S., along with hummus, dips and whole grain tortilla chips. This acquisition is helping to reshape our portfolio toward faster-growing categories. Garden Fresh Gourmet’s on-trend products will allow the Campbell Fresh division to expand in the deli section of the grocery store perimeter and will complement our strong presence in the produce section. This is the latest in a series of moves we have made in response to increased consumer interest in foods focused on health and well-being, first with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms followed by the acquisitions of Plum and Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Committed to Labeling GMO Foods
Campbell believes in the consumer’s right to know what is in their food, which is why we announced our commitment to labeling our U.S. products which use ingredients derived from genetically modified crops in FY2016. We believe that GMOs are safe, as the science indicates that food derived from crops grown using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. Campbell is committed to printing clear and simple language on the labels of our U.S. products which use ingredients derived from genetically modified crops.

The food industry is in the midst of revolutionary change. Changing demographics, socioeconomic shifts and digital 
connectivity are forcing the industry to adapt and evolve. One of the most pervasive shifts is around transparency. Consumers are seeking transparency in all areas of their lives, driven by an inherent distrust in large institutions. This distrust has been accelerated by digital connectivity where information and debate are available in one click. 
For the food industry this translates into consumers’ desire to know what’s in the food they buy, where it is made and 
how the food is produced. A new generation of consumers is seeking food that better aligns with their values, and is authentic, natural and wholesome. And, they expect a level of transparency at each step of the supply chain — from farm to table. 
Campbell believes that providing easy access to this information builds consumer trust — something we have invested in 
doing for nearly 150 years. In this new era of transparency, we are on a journey to be open and honest about our business and earn the trust of a new generation of consumers.
In this changing environment, Campbell’s Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments — serves as our North Star. It is a filter we apply to strategic decisions and informs the way we engage with our consumers. It has also been a guiding factor in identifying strategic imperatives that we feel are key to our success, one of which is transparency. We have made a commitment to set the standard for transparency in the food industry. We are doing this by engaging our consumers in conversation that allows us to address the issues that are most meaningful to them. Actions such as announcing our commitment to labeling our U.S. products which use ingredients derived from genetically modified crops, removing artificial colors and flavors from our recipes, and transitioning to non-BPA packaging are all a part of this journey. It has also inspired us to look at our recipes and use more of the ingredients people tell us they want, and less of those they would prefer to avoid. As part of our efforts, we have also launched a website where we are open about the ingredients we use and the choices we have made.Material Issue

PRODUCTS  |  32What’s in My Food?
Campbell’s purpose-driven commitment to setting a 
new bar for transparency in the food industry led us to take a big step in FY2015 by sharing with our consumers what goes into our food, how we make our food and why we make the choices behind the ingredients used in our food. The impetus for these decisions followed extensive consumer research about what they wanted to know about food. Our intent is not to be perfect, but rather to strive continuously for an open exchange of information so consumers can make the most informed choices possible for themselves and their families. 
The centerpiece of this new direction has been the 
introduction of a website — www.whatsinmyfood.com —  
where consumers can access a wide range of information about our products, and have questions and concerns addressed in one easily accessible place. This site provides information on several of our top brands, such as iconic Campbell’s® Condensed soups, V8®  beverages, Pepperidge 
Farm®  Goldfish®  and SpaghettiOs® . These steps are just the 
beginning, and there is a great deal of work ahead of us. In order to create a more open and honest dialogue, we welcome feedback that will help us on this journey. 
We have also been proactive in transparency of ingredients 
derived from GMO crops, and, in 2015, we became the first major food company to disclose the presence of these ingredients made from GMO crops in our products via our website, www.whatsinmyfood.com. Our decision was guided by our Purpose , rooted in our consumer-first 
mindset, and driven by our commitment to transparency — to be open and honest about our food. We believe it is the right thing to do for consumers and for our business.
Responsible Labeling
GMO Labeling
One of the most hotly debated topics within the issue  
of transparency in the U.S. is the labeling of GMOs. An overwhelming majority of U.S. consumers today believe that they have the right to know what is in their food and we agree. That’s why, in FY2016, we formally announced our support for the enactment of federal legislation in the U.S. to establish a single mandatory labeling standard for foods derived from GMOs.The decisions we have made with regard to GMOs have not been because we dispute the science behind GMOs or their safety. The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence indicates that GMOs are safe and that foods derived from crops using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. Ingredients derived from these crops are in many of our products and we will continue to use them. We also believe that technology will play a crucial role in feeding the world. For us, it is simply a matter of transparency. 
Facts Up Front
We collaborated with the Grocery Manufacturers 
Association and the Food Marketing Institute to provide consumers with a voluntary and uniform “front of pack” labeling scheme, Facts Up Front. We place icons on the front of products displaying their calorie count, saturated fat, sodium and sugar content per serving. Facts Up Front supports the current Nutrition Facts Panel appearing on the reverse of our products, and is consistent with current FDA and USDA food labeling regulations. By the end of FY2015, 100 percent of Campbell’s®  and Pepperidge Farm®  products displayed 
the Facts Up Front icons. Transition and timing for new brands and acquisitions is in development. Learn more at www.factsupfront.org.Products

How We Manage
Why It Matters
Food safety is receiving unprecedented attention in the marketplace and in the public policy arena today. It is easy to 
see why: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that about 48 million people, or one in six Americans, suffer from food-borne illness every year; 128,000 people are hospitalized and 3,000 die. Yet foodborne illnesses are largely preventable. Food safety and quality are assumed requirements for any major food company in the industry today. It is a given that we will dedicate every resource to ensuring that our consumers are protected from foodborne illnesses, allergens or other health and safety concerns. We know that if we aren’t diligent in our food safety processes, there are significant financial and reputational implications that could be devastating.
We closely monitor our product safety throughout the 
entire value chain — from the moment ingredients are harvested on the farm to the minute finished products leave our distribution centers. As we strive to implement continuous improvement, our quality control systems are kept up to date with the most modern technology, while meeting the industry’s highest standards for quality assurance.We have a long history of regulatory compliance, as well as quality standards and policies that are industry-leading and global in approach. We require these standards of our own facilities, as well as of our contract manufacturers and suppliers abroad. In 2016, we kept a close watch on the latest food safety trends and research, shared best practices with peers as a leading member of the Grocery Manufacturers Association and maintained our commitment to Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certification for all of our manufacturing facilities.

Our Progress
Ingredient Safety
Our products are only as safe as the individual ingredients 
used in them. That’s why we invest in supplier engagement around ingredient safety. We collaborate directly with our suppliers, packaging companies and co-manufacturers 
to ensure that our product ingredients and packaging 
materials are safe and that quality controls match our 
stringent standards. 
To maintain these relationships, we work with our 
partners to help align their operations with new rules 
and regulations in food safety and quality standards. 
Our Supply Base Requirements and Expectations 
Manual, updated on a regular basis, outlines our strict 
safety and quality requirements. Suppliers are subject to occasional comprehensive audits so that we can make 
certain our high standards are being followed. We also 
use preventive control systems like the Hazard Analysis 
and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and prerequisite programs, at both our facilities and supplier facilities. 
Food Safety Modernization Act
Under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2011, foreign suppliers are required to verify that their food safety systems and programs meet U.S. standards before their products are permitted to enter U.S. commerce. We use a worldwide mapping system of our supply base to review and monitor sourced product ingredients 
and track supplier performance and compliance. In 2015, 
new requirements were added under the FSMA, creating 
stricter guidelines on preventive controls, produce safety and foreign supplier verification and third-party auditors. 
Allergens
In order to protect those consumers who have allergies 
to certain ingredients, a priority in the manufacturing 
process is to minimize the risk of allergens ending up in 
food products by mistake. Food allergens at Campbell facilities are regulated using strict internal controls that safeguard our consumers against any cross-contact with 
unintended ingredients. Our data system is designed to 
maintain the accuracy of label ingredient statements 
and allergen disclosures, and our own advanced coding 
and scanning technology verifies individual packages for 
labeling accuracy, allergen control and product traceability. 
Some of the food allergens that Campbell monitors include fin fish, peanuts, wheat, shellfish, tree nuts, soy protein, eggs, sesame seeds, dairy protein and gluten.Products
Managing Food Safety & Quality 
Our goal for food safety and quality is zero tolerance for variance, and we maintain robust standards and controls to eliminate and avoid hazards. However, we are always prepared to take swift action when and if we suspect that the safety of a product is compromised or at any degree of risk. For any food safety incident, our crisis management team responds swiftly, working in tandem with the appropriate regulatory agency and internal teams to initiate a recall process. In this process, consumers are alerted about the safety concern, and we take steps to remove the product immediately from store warehouses and shelves. Working through protocols established by government agencies around the world, Campbell teams provide regular updates to the agencies on the scope and status of any product recall. During the execution of any recall, we will provide ongoing support to consumers and our retail trade customers to address any questions and concerns they may have. After a recall, Campbell implements an in-depth root-cause analysis to take the necessary corrective actions.Continuous Improvement
Our Global Quality and Food Safety organization focuses its efforts not only on prevention but also on continuous improvement of its programs. Each year, the organization works diligently to build stronger and more effective food safety and quality systems. We work continuously to fine-tune our systems and practices to ensure not only strict adherence to our policies and standards, but also to our ongoing objective of getting every aspect of product quality “right the first time.” Our quality teams have fostered an exacting food safety mindset across our businesses, and these efforts are showing measurable and sustainable results in auditing, statistical process monitoring and supplier oversight. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement, we can effectively manage risk, while delivering excellent products to our customers.

Why It Matters
How We Manage
As a global food company, we have the responsibility to ensure that the way in which we source our ingredients is 
both sustainable and ethical. We understand that our supply chain is key to delivering uncompromising value to our customers and consumers. We continuously seek to enhance the quality of our products and brands, not only by the ingredients we use, but also by working with suppliers who meet our responsible sourcing standards. 
Understanding and mitigating the environmental, economic and social risks within our supply chain is necessary 
to ensure our products are produced in a responsible manner. By incorporating responsible sourcing practices, we are able to mitigate negative impacts to the environment; realize economic savings; improve supplier relationships; reduce social, reputational, environmental and financial risks; and ensure long-term resiliency. 
Our strategic approach for managing our evolving supply chain is focused on ensuring our products are crafted with care with inputs that are ethically and sustainably sourced. Our Procurement Sustainability strategy focuses on the following key areas:
• Understanding and Managing Risks;
• Engaging Our Suppliers;• Setting Expectations; and• Managing Performance.As a result of the findings from our materiality process, 
we identified the need to further enhance this strategy and put additional resources in place to address the increased expectations of both our internal and external stakeholders. This year, we activated against that need and appointed Campbell’s first Director — Procurement Corporate Responsibility to develop and implement a holistic responsible sourcing program.Material Issue

Understanding and Managing Risk 
Our supply chain risk management process consists  
of three parts: risk identification, risk analysis and risk 
mitigation. We’ve assessed “hot spots” within our supply chain related to sustainability issues and are proactive 
with our suppliers to address key issues. We are currently 
implementing a new risk analysis model that includes 
environmental sustainability, financial, supply and human rights risks associated with our product categories. Currently, our most important risks are associated with 
the rising cost of raw materials, impacts to climate and 
deforestation, brand and reputational damage, business 
disruption, regulatory challenges and supply chain interruption. 
We have embedded value chain risk mapping as part 
of the overall purchasing manager’s category strategy. 
When a Campbell buyer develops their strategy for an 
ingredient or raw material, we consider sustainability as part of the value-added opportunity. Supply chain mapping also gives us a holistic view of our entire supply chain and shows areas of opportunity to collaborate with suppliers to improve functionality and sustainability, while driving cost savings. 
Engaging Our Suppliers 
One of the key elements of our strategy is to partner and collaborate with our suppliers to better understand sustainability issues in each category. Campbell collaborates with strategic suppliers on sustainability issues through our Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) program. Our SRM program enhances and expands our regular communications and idea exchanges with select suppliers, engaging them on topics such as sustainability projects, best practices and benchmarking, while addressing emerging trends in ethical and responsible sourcing. Our ultimate goal is to leverage these critical relationships for a mutual gain. 
Setting Expectations 
Because responsible sourcing is integral to delivering our company’s Purpose , we require our suppliers to 
follow environmental and social standards that are aligned with our expectations. We have developed a Responsible Sourcing Supplier Code that identifies  the expectations and requirements for current and potential brokers, co-packers, re-packers, special packers, suppliers, warehouses and licensees to meet our CR  and sustainability objectives. These standards cover a variety of critical subjects, including legal compliance, health and safety, human rights, environmental issues and employment standards. This code was recently published and we are in the process of rolling it out to our suppliers globally. More information can be found on our dedicated supplier page .Managing Performance 
We are currently revamping our Supplier CSR Scorecard to capture environmental performance metrics, as well as social responsibility efforts, to better understand the policies and practices of our supply base. The Scorecard will allow Campbell to benchmark and identify supply chain opportunities, especially where Campbell can directly engage suppliers on sustainability. We expect that the Scorecard will become a competitive differentiator when reviewing future supplier relationships. Our Campbell-certified auditors conduct onsite audits of our suppliers, based on the standards laid out in our supplier base manual, and we perform third-party audits to maintain high accountability and performance. Follow-up audits and assessments are conducted based on the risk potential of supply interruption. We are currently expanding these efforts to include full social responsibility audits  of suppliers based on risk.Products

Our Progress
Commitments and Progress
Supply chain issues in the food industry have grown 
increasingly complex in today’s global economy, making visibility a constant challenge for major food brands such as ours. We hear increasingly from our external 
stakeholders — including NGOs, suppliers, industry and 
professional associations, consumers, academic institutions 
and other outside experts — that supply chain issues are a top corporate responsibility concern. 
We collaborate with these stakeholders and rely on 
their expertise to better understand their concerns, communicate and establish a position, provide information and, when appropriate, take corrective action. A few examples of the types of NGO groups we engage with include the Humane Society of the United States, GreenAmerica, Environmental Defense Fund and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. While we are currently evaluating our ethical and sustainable supply chain strategy, we have made commitments and progress in some key areas. 
Deforestation 
Deforestation is a major concern among many NGOs 
and other stakeholders. Irresponsible sourcing of ingredients such as palm oil, soy, beef and pulp/paper can harm fragile ecosystems and impact many vulnerable communities. We also recognize that deforestation is seen as a key contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. There are also many negative social impacts from irresponsible sourcing of these ingredients. 
We see the connection between the long-term vitality of 
our business and an imperative to advance environmental and social sustainability. Campbell is a member of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) and the CGF member companies have agreed to mobilize their resources to help achieve zero net deforestation by 2020. As part of this commitment, Campbell has set targets to source palm oil sustainably, and to work with a range of our suppliers to drive more sustainable sourcing of other ingredients and packaging to help achieve zero net deforestation by 2020.Palm Oil 
We are a relatively small user of palm oil, which is an 
ingredient in some of our cookie and cracker products. We understand that unsustainable harvesting of palm oil can have serious social and environmental impacts. Both Campbell and our palm oil suppliers are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a group composed of palm growers, palm oil users, retail food chains and NGOs. As a company, Campbell is working 
with our suppliers to ensure that the palm oil we source 
is derived from sustainable practices. Our commitment 
to purchase 100 percent certified sustainably sourced 
palm oil through a combination of mass balance and segregated was met in 2016.
For more information, please see our Palm Oil Guidelines, 
which include details on our commitments and milestones. 
Human Rights 
We are keenly aware of the potential for human rights 
risks within our supply chain and know that we must be 
proactive in assessing and addressing these risks. We 
will continue to perform risk assessments of our global 
agricultural supply chain to ensure that we are addressing 
any potential human rights issues. This year, we are 
partnering with a third party to conduct a formal risk 
mapping of our ingredient supply chain. We will utilize the 
results of this risk mapping to develop a risk profile for 
each supplier. Also, as part of our commitment through 
the CGF, Campbell is actively involved in CGF’s Social 
Sustainability Committee, which is focused on efforts to eradicate forced labor in the supply chain. We understand 
that this is an important issue, and we are working to put 
more formal strategies in place in this area.
Animal Welfare 
We are dedicated to the humane treatment of animals 
and believe that animal welfare is an important part of 
our vision for a responsible supply chain. As part of our 
animal welfare commitments, animal welfare requirements 
are integrated into our Responsible Sourcing Supplier 
Code. As stakeholder expectations continue to change, 
we evaluate necessary updates to our policies. As such, 
we have made specific commitments to eliminate the 
use of gestation crates for pigs by 2022 and to source 
only cage-free eggs within our supply chain by 2025. Products 
2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 
2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTPRODUCTS  |  38Supplier Diversity
We believe our suppliers should be a reflection of our 
diverse consumers and the markets in which we sell our products. Supplier diversity adds value to our long-term growth, strengthens our competitive advantage and has the potential to increase market share and shareholder return. We strengthen our U.S. supply base by offering diverse suppliers equal access to potential business opportunities.
In FY2016, Campbell purchases from women- and 
minority-owned suppliers exceeded $164 million. Since 2006, our diversity spend has increased at an average compound annual growth rate of more than 6 percent, with a spend of nearly $1.6 billion since the program inception. In our continued efforts to be more reflective of the communities we serve, we have broadened our categories of diverse suppliers to include both veteran-and LGBT-owned (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) businesses. 
By supporting minority- and women-owned businesses, 
Campbell has increased our social impact on local communities by offering employment opportunities, modeling for younger generations and encouraging purchases from other diverse businesses. The business advantages from a robust supplier diversity program are clear. We’ve witnessed competitive costs and quality improvements; responsiveness and agility to adapt to changing business needs; dedicated and enhanced customer service; and fresh perspectives and new ways of thinking that promote innovation. We advocate for our diverse suppliers through stakeholder engagement efforts, including corporate memberships and sponsorships at supplier diversity events with leading organizations such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council.

2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
PLANET  |  42Why It Matters
The rising global population and accelerated global development and resource use require that companies implement 
holistic approaches that achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. Sustainable business models incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests. They drive corporate innovation for sustainability and help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes. Companies that adopt this approach aspire to grow their businesses while also reducing their environmental footprints. 
As one of the world’s leading manufacturers of quality food and beverages, with growers and production facilities 
around the globe, we understand the necessity of being good stewards of the environment. Reducing the resources we use and having an environmental management system in place help us to mitigate the impacts of climate change, better manage compliance, reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The risks of not doing these things can be detrimental to a manufacturing business and can impact profitability and reputation.
How We Manage
Our commitment to the environment is manifested through our sustainable business model strategies, which include understanding risks, setting goals and measuring progress against those goals. We make the biggest impact for our consumers, customers, employees and shareholders when we set and meet high goals as a business. 
We take a precautionary approach to the environment 
by seeking to apply processes or practices with less environmental impact when possible. Our primary  
2020 sustainability goal is to reduce our environmental footprint — defined as water and GHG emissions per tonne of food produced — by 50 percent. As we've worked toward this goal, we’ve integrated strategies throughout our global business operations to ensure the widest possible impact. Our supporting 2020 goals, which track back to a FY2008 baseline, keep us continually focused on building sustainable business models. They include: 
• Reducing energy use by 35 percent and sourcing  
40 percent of our electricity from renewable or 
alternative energy sources;Material Issue

Our Progress
• Recycling 95 percent of waste generated globally;
• Eliminating 100 million pounds of packaging from 
Campbell products; and
• Deriving 100 percent of our global packaging 
materials from sustainable sources (renewable, 
recyclable or recycled content).
We have also continued to strengthen our Environmental 
Management System (EMS) in order to measure 
performance, ensure compliance and integrate 
environmental programs into our global business 
operations. Our EMS includes a technology platform that 
is used to manage compliance issues and to help us 
manage and measure our progress against our goals. Another key to a successful environmental sustainability 
strategy is to ensure that there is accountability across the entire business. To evolve the way we drive sustainability strategy, performance measurement and results, we created a Sustainability Steering Committee with key work streams and assigned leadership. This cross-functional Committee and network teams, which are co-led by the Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability and the Vice President of Global Engineering include business leaders who are accountable for setting goals and managing progress against the goals in energy, water, waste, agriculture, packaging, procurement, transportation and contract manufacturing. The network teams are also responsible for evaluating and setting both long-term and annual performance. 
Energy & Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
The food and beverage sector is one of the top five consumers of fuels and power in U.S. manufacturing, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Electricity usage and the burning of natural gas generate GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. As a corporation, we have an obligation to our employees, our customers and the environment to manage and reduce the energy that we use to produce our products. By finding efficiencies in our processes, we can reduce energy usage and the associated GHG emissions. 
To ensure we are managing energy use effectively, we have 
tracked and publicly reported on electricity and fuel use in our manufacturing facilities since 2008. Since that time, we have reduced GHG emissions per tonne of food produced by more than 24 percent. Our goal was a 50 percent reduction by 2020. We knew that cutting our emissions in half over 12 years would be a challenge for us. We have learned a great deal and are looking forward to applying those learnings as we live into our Purpose .
Renewable Energy
We continue to evaluate and implement renewable energy technologies at our plant locations to demonstrate the viability of these clean sources of energy and to contribute to state Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) compliance markets. 
As a result of our renewable energy goal to source  
40 percent of our electricity from renewable or alternative 
sources, we have successfully contributed a combined 13.4 MW of power to the U.S. grid from renewable sources. 
We will continue to work toward our renewable energy 
goal and look for opportunities to deliver additional renewable energy to power our manufacturing facilities.Waste 
Waste is generated across a business value chain: upstream in supplier facilities and processes, at the center in our manufacturing sites and downstream by our customers and consumers. Without efficient management practices in place, waste can have a direct impact on communities when it is discarded in landfills or leaks into waterways. Waste to landfill also generates GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. 
Fortunately, solutions for reducing waste are very often 
wins for efficiency and cost as well. Recycling and reusing materials can be a source of revenue, while reducing cost to landfill. Campbell has a long tradition of reducing food waste to landfill through recycling, reuse, food donation and sending inedible food waste to feed animals at local farms — as outlined by the EPA Food Waste Hierarchy. 
To build on this work, Campbell began tracking and 
reporting all waste and disposal methods at our plant locations in 2008. We set a goal to achieve a recycle  
rate across all facilities of 95 percent by 2020. In FY2016, we achieved an 86 percent recycle rate. We have also re-categorized some of our waste streams internally to improve our data accuracy and allow us to manage our waste streams more effectively moving forward. As we have updated our methodology, we have also shifted our focus from recycling to solid waste reduction, specifically landfill waste reduction. We believe this focus will drive tighter alignment to business value, cost reduction, our food waste strategy and societal expectations. We believe this shift in focus will also put us on a journey  
to zero waste to landfill. 
Water
Campbell relies on water across our value chain — in the fields that grow ingredients, in the plants where we manufacture our products and in some of our products  
2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
 
2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
PLANET  |  44Planet
as a primary ingredient. Maintaining a clean and 
sustainable supply of water is imperative to the future of both our company and the communities where we operate. We recognize the impacts of our business, and we strive to comply with all applicable legislative and regulatory requirements with respect to water quality and consumption. We also engage at vital points in our value chain to manage and reduce water consumption as outlined in our Global Water Policy. 
Water scarcity is a particular business risk in certain 
locations where the cost of business could increase due to limited water supply. Furthermore, water scarcity could impact our ability to source ingredients or to manufacture products when an adequate supply of water is not available. We proactively manage water scarcity risks by working with growers and manufacturing personnel to track water usage and increase efficient water use. 
Since 2008, Campbell has been tracking and publicly 
reporting on water usage in our manufacturing facilities, where we implement capital improvements focused on water reduction. Our goal was to reduce water use per tonne of food produced by 50 percent by 2020. We have achieved a 17.8 percent reduction in water use per tonne of food produced since our base year of 2008. 
As part of this effort and to better understand our risk 
at the local level, we continued to perform a site-by-site water scarcity mapping in 2016, cross-referencing the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s 
Global Water Tool.

proactively in the development of sustainable alternatives that are economically feasible, grounded in science and technology, and have sustainable end-of-life scenarios. 
To help us attain these 2020 packaging goals, Campbell follows five packaging principles that drive innovation:
• Protect: Implement packaging that delivers the safest, 
highest-quality food, while ensuring consumer and 
brand protection.
• Reduce: Continuously use packaging material and 
processes that utilize fewer resources while maintaining product quality and supply chain efficiency.
• Recycle: Utilize recyclable and recycled content in 
packaging materials whenever possible.
• Renew: Use renewable resources in packaging 
materials whenever safe and effective.
• Partner: Work with suppliers to promote clean production 
technologies and best manufacturing practices.
In FY2016, packaging efforts eliminated 2.2 million pounds of raw material from our manufacturing processes. This year’s reduction was largely driven by the reduction of steel from transitioning Chunky™ soup 
and SpaghettiOs® to stackable cans. From FY2009 through FY2016, we have eliminated a cumulative amount of more than 139 million pounds of packaging materials. 
Logistics & Transportation
Transportation and handling of our raw materials, ingredients and finished products from farm to factory to stores presents multiple opportunities to create efficiencies. Our goals for reducing our carbon footprint are focused on reductions of our Scope 3 GHG emissions through supply chain efficiencies, which are driven by our internal optimization efforts, as well as through our third-party warehousing and transportation partners. Key initiatives include:
• Evaluating our manufacturing/sourcing footprint 
continually, to shorten the product sourcing distance 
from farm to table; 
• Optimizing our sourcing profile to reduce supply chain 
“touches,” thereby reducing the need for unnecessary product positioning;
• Improving our storage and transportation “density,” 
which enables fewer miles traveled inside and outside our Distribution Centers (DCs);
• Utilizing more environmentally friendly transportation 
methods, such as intermodal and compressed natural gas, to service our customers;
• Aligning with carriers that are utilizing higher-efficiency 
power units, with improved miles per gallon;
• Employing better DC “yard management” to reduce idle 
times and minimize unnecessary shuttle movements;
• Ensuring that all core U.S. retail carriers are EPA 
SmartWay certified;
• Improving performance on DC recycling efforts (air 
bags, plastic overwrap, corrugate, etc.);
• Reducing the potential for landfill waste through 
product damage reduction initiatives; and
• Making improvements in high-efficiency LED lighting 
(among others).Planet

PLANET  |  47Why It Matters
A common bumper sticker in rural areas of the U.S. reads “No farms, no food.” Agriculture is indeed the root of 
our company and products. For nearly 150 years, Campbell has worked closely with farmers to source high-quality ingredients for our nutritious and flavorful products. 
In recent decades, the growth of the global middle class and overall global population has translated into 
unprecedented demand for agricultural products, placing increased pressure on land, water and agriculture inputs. It is material to our company to invest in the efficiency of agricultural supply chains to ensure their resilience in an often volatile global economy. 
Agricultural science also indicates that, for most food products, the farm is where many significant environmental 
impacts are incurred. Often, crop irrigation is the largest contributor to a food product’s water footprint, and fertilizer production and use is the largest contributor to its GHG footprint. In 2016, a CR materiality assessment confirmed the importance of agriculture sustainability to Campbell, with a high percentage of stakeholders indicating its relevance. Large retail customers have also identified agriculture sustainability as being of critical importance to price and supply resiliency, as well as to meeting customer expectations. Material Issue
SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
“I’ve spent a lot of time at different forums, and sustainable agriculture is the next big thing that food 
companies are working on. There’s a big shift happening. Customers and a desire for transparency are 
drivers, but as food companies we also realize that sustainability of supply reduces risk in today’s world. 
There’s a growing realization that agriculture represents the largest impact on natural systems, yet we need 
agriculture to survive. We’re starting to see a lot of organizations express an interest, for the first time, 
in improving farming practices. I see sustainability programs as a way to communicate to the world the 
progress that growers have made and the environmental benefits that come from efficiency.”

PLANET  |  48Our Progress
How We Manage
Our Sustainable Agriculture Program encourages 
responsible and resilient agriculture systems to protect the long-term viability of the farms and ecosystems from which we source our ingredients. Responsible management of agricultural resources has been a hallmark of Campbell operations since our beginning. When our Sustainable Agriculture Program re-launched with a strategic emphasis in 2012, we were building upon more than 140 years of investment in agricultural research and farmer relationships. 
Today, our Sustainable Agriculture Program is guided 
by a formal strategic plan centered on tomatoes and other iconic crops in the Campbell portfolio. We take a “measure to manage” approach, in which key agriculture metrics are identified and used to provide perspective to growers about their performance. While individual farmer information is kept private, we provide farmers with a snapshot of how their metrics compare to the average performance of other Campbell suppliers who grow the same crop in the region. The perspective helps them identify strengths and opportunities for their individual fields and farms. We expect the adoption of embedded technologies and “big data” analytics to accelerate these capabilities in the future.
This is a relatively new concept for sustainable agriculture 
programs, and one in which Campbell is a key voice. We have a leading role in such industry efforts as the Stewardship Index for Specialty Crops and the Food, Beverage and Agriculture Sector Working Group of The Sustainability Consortium. Our program is also linked with Campbell Procurement and other industry-wide efforts regarding strategic ingredients such as poultry, beef, dairy and flour. In 2013, Campbell began working directly with these suppliers to communicate our strategic plan for synchronizing their sustainability efforts with our own. 
Our sustainable agriculture strategy continues to focus 
on driving improvement in five priority areas — GHG emissions, water, fertilizer and pesticide reduction, and soil quality improvements — all of which were identified through a stakeholder engagement exercise in 2012. For three of these priorities, we have set 2020 goals: 
• Climate: Reduce GHGs per pound of ingredient by  
20 percent.
• Water: Reduce water use per unit of ingredient by  
20 percent.
• Fertilizer: Reduce nitrogen applied per pound of 
ingredient by 10 percent.
In addition, in August 2014, Campbell furthered its 
commitment to sustainable agriculture through its partnership with Walmart and announced an additional goal to reduce GHGs and water use by 20 percent per ton of food produced for its five key agricultural ingredients: tomatoes, carrots, celery, potatoes and jalapeños. In 2016, Campbell created the Director of Procurement CSR and Director of Sustainable Agriculture positions. Jointly, these two positions will drive Responsible Sourcing and Sustainable Agriculture for Campbell.
 
2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet
As a business with a value chain that begins on the farm, we are acutely aware of the potential risks to the food system posed by climate change. Weather pattern changes over time can have a direct impact on many of our agricultural producers, which in turn, could significantly impact agricultural inputs to our product portfolio. Our climate strategy is integrated with our overall sustainable business strategy and encompasses sustainable agriculture, procurement, supplier engagement, performance reporting and reducing our carbon footprint. Fertilizer Optimization and  GHG Emissions Reduction
The production and use of nitrogen fertilizer is the largest contributor to GHG emissions from farming practices. Best practices and improvements in the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer use are crucial to achieving our GHG reduction goal. In tomatoes, our year-on-year data shows that nitrogen use efficiency is increasing with the adoption of best practices and technologies. Drip irrigation technology is part of the solution. At the University of California, Davis, Russell Ranch facility, scientists documented a  
2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTPLANET  |  49more than 50 percent reduction per acre of the key GHG 
associated with fertilizer — nitrogen oxide — when drip irrigation was used to deliver the fertilizer close to the plant roots. This practice also increases crop yields, a financial incentive for farmers. We urge our growers to adopt drip irrigation, where economically feasible, along with nutrient management planning best practices such as soil testing and nitrogen budgeting. 
A Collaborative Partnership
Our key retail customers also understand the nitrogen opportunity. In 2013, we agreed to work with grain suppliers to improve fertilizer efficiency on 70,000 acres earmarked for Pepperidge Farm® products supplied to 
Walmart. In 2015, we signed an agreement with SUSTAIN, 
a project of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and 
Winfield United — a cooperative of agriculture retail chains and crop consultants throughout the U.S. and Canada. This innovative program enlists the aid of a voice that farmers trust — their crop consultant advisers — and equips that voice with knowledge of tools and techniques for farms to implement in their cropping systems. 
This partnership expanded our fertilizer optimization 
programs in sourcing areas of Ohio and Nebraska that provide wheat to Pepperidge Farm. We plan to enroll an additional 70,000 acres into our fertilizer optimization programs by 2020. The project aims to improve water quality and reduce GHG emissions by optimizing fertilizer use and advancing soil conservation for farmers in our wheat and corn sourcing areas. 
SUSTAIN is part of EDF’s Sustainable Sourcing Initiative to enable Campbell, along with industry peers, to do  
our part to make fertilizer efficiency and soil health the norm in U.S. grain production. EDF is a leading developer of reporting systems to track and measure both the environmental and economic benefits of fertilization optimization and conducts on-farm trials of fertilizer optimization tools to make sure farmers are using the best tools available.
Efficient use of inputs such as fertilizer also has positive 
business implications for our growers. It helps reduce the likelihood of regulatory impacts, which can negatively affect cost or production for their operations. Preventive adoption of best practices also enhances our growers’ efficiency, as well as reducing 
cost and improving yields in many cases. 
Water and GHG Reductions
We continue to make progress in our priority areas, particularly water consumption. In FY2016, we reduced our agricultural water use (gal/lb raw tomato) by 22 percent and produced 22 percent fewer fertilizer-related GHG emissions per ton of tomato, compared to a 2012 baseline. Based on data collected over multiple years, we know the typical Campbell farmer needs approximately 8.5 gallons of water for every pound of tomatoes produced, which is in line with other irrigated fruits and vegetables. But there’s still room for improvement. To reach our 2020 goal, we’re working directly with contract farms to develop more sustainable irrigation practices.
Water and fertilizer continue to be major priorities for 
our key stakeholders, with fertilizer a key contributor  to GHG footprints as well as water-quality impacts. As recent droughts have demonstrated, restrictions on water availability for irrigation significantly impact what crops farmers can grow and where they can grow them. Campbell has been able to manage through drought conditions successfully due to close working relationships with farmers, through the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies and practices, and through a small amount of shifting volume among sourcing regions. 
Drip irrigation, for example, is one of the most efficient 
methods of watering crops because drip-irrigated tomato fields typically use about 40 percent less water NITROGEN USE

number of Campbell growers using drip irrigation has almost doubled in the last five years, with 69 percent of Campbell’s tomato acres currently using this type of irrigation. Using our 2012 baseline data, we are seeking to increase that number by identifying drip-irrigation opportunities across geographies. By showing individual growers how their water use compares to local/state averages, we ultimately want to help them move toward more efficient irrigation practices. 
In 2014 and 2015, some of our tomato farmers and our carrot-
growing operations at Bolthouse Farms were able to secure drought grant funding from the state of California to implement water-saving technologies, while also reducing GHG emissions. 
Bolthouse Farms has also been piloting improved irrigation 
techniques on certain farms, which has reduced water use on those pilot farms by 20 percent. 
After two years of working primarily in tomatoes, we pledged in 
2014 to expand our climate and water goals to four additional key vegetables: carrots, potatoes, celery and jalapeños. As a result, we now have data to set a baseline in these vegetables and are exploring collaborations to identify opportunities. For example, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in New Jersey will be working with Campbell vegetable growers in that state in 2016 to assess conservation practices appropriate to each farm.
Our focus on water extends to our agriculture processing plants 
as well. For example, our tomato processing plants in Dixon and Stockton, California, reduced freshwater pumped per ton of tomatoes processed by 41 percent in FY2016 as compared to a 2010 baseline. The plants track performance daily throughout each harvest season. During the off season, learnings from harvest are built into improvement plans to be implemented during the following harvest. 
As a proactive employer and neighbor, these actions began even 
before it was clear California had entered its most recent drought. In 2015, Campbell also became a founding member of the California Water Action Collaborative , a platform of diverse stakeholders 
working together to improve water security in California for people, business, agriculture and nature.
Pesticide Use 
Reducing pests and disease helps create healthier crops and increases yields, but the industry’s traditional control methods have often depended on pesticides. Today’s sustainable pest and disease management, however, is achievable through a focus on prevention and by employing a variety of coordinated methods, collectively known as integrated pest management (IPM). 
Pesticide reduction is an area where Campbell has historically 
been a leader. Though an effective IPM program will generally utilize pesticides to some degree, Campbell works with growers to ensure that prevention practices are the first line of defense. 
To enhance our IPM efforts, each year, Campbell agriculture 
experts work to add more disease-resistant tomato varieties to our agriculture program, with the goal of creating traditionally bred plant varieties that allow farmers to increase yields while reducing or eliminating the need for pesticides.ADVOCATING  FOR SUSTAINABLE  FARMING PRACTICES 
Campbell’s focus on sustainable 
agriculture doesn’t stop with our growers or crops. We are leaders in a variety of agricultural efforts to create a more sustainable business model at Campbell and to foster more sustainable practices in the farming industry. Some examples include:
• Helping to organize an educational 
tour of agriculture and sustainability issues for The Sustainability Consortium member companies  
and affiliated organizations.
• Informing and learning of ways to measure farm sustainability in connection with the Stewardship Index for Specialty Crops — a collaboration between environmental groups, growers and processors in the fruit, vegetable and nut industries.
• Sharing information among food processors on agriculture best practices and sustainability opportunities via the Agricultural Committee of the California League  
of Food Processors, for which  
Dr. Dan Sonke, Campbell's Director  
of Sustainable Agriculture, served  
as chair from 2014-2016.

How We Manage
Why It Matters
Ethical business practices are essential to the long-term success of a company. Strong business ethics set the tone 
for the culture of an organization and provide guidance for employees in making decisions that are beneficial to themselves and to the organization. At Campbell, we understand that having a foundation of ethical business practices creates positive impacts on the company and allows us to attract and retain the type of talented employees who share our values. Setting this foundation also reduces many risks that companies today face, including being fined for poor behavior or experiencing damage to their reputation, one of a company’s most valuable assets that can be difficult to rebuild. At Campbell, we pride ourselves on the reputation we have built and in providing our employees with an ethical workplace where they are proud to work.
Campbell’s compliance and ethics program, known as Winning With Integrity, reflects our conviction that conducting business in compliance with the law and the highest standards of business ethics is essential to our success. As reflected in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (The Code), the foundation document of our program, employees share responsibility for ensuring that the Winning With Integrity principles are fulfilled every day, through each and every action taken — whether in the marketplace, the workplace or the community. The Winning With Integrity program equips 
our employees with the resources, tools and guidance to help build a better Campbell.
The Code outlines our company’s basic standards and 
expectations, highlights important policies and summarizes certain fundamental legal requirements that our employees must follow. Each new employee receives a copy of the Material Issue

conditions, a robust healthy pregnancy program  
and support employees’ well-being through stress management, nutrition counseling and weight management programs. Our smoking cessation program provides phone counseling and nicotine replacement therapy if needed. Employees may also  join the onsite, state-of-the-art fitness facility at the World Headquarters location, where personal training sessions and exercise classes are offered. Corporate discounts to select fitness facilities are also available. Total Rewards and Wealth Creation 
Campbell offers a competitive, market-based, performance-  
driven Total Rewards program. Employees are evaluated 
annually through our Performance Management process, which links objectives with measurable business outcomes. The goal of the program is to reward individual and team contributions based on the outcomes. Campbell also offers various retirement benefits, including a 401(k) retirement plan. This plan offers multiple investment choices that employees choose based on their personal goals and individual risk tolerance. 
Work/Life Balance 
In 2016, we introduced a gender-neutral Paid Parental 
Leave Policy that provides 10 weeks of fully paid leave for primary caregivers. For a birth mother, this is in addition to up to eight weeks paid short-term disability. Two weeks of the leave can be taken intermittently, designed to help ease the transition back to work or to be used as needed within 12 months of birth or adoption. We also provide two weeks of fully paid parental leave for secondary caregivers.
Campbell helps employees balance their work and 
personal commitments through flexible work arrangements and other resources, including: 
• 24-hour access to counseling on personal, emotional, 
workplace, parenting and other issues.
• Information on everyday challenges such as budgeting 
for personal finances, locating daycare or elder care, 
and searching for colleges.
At World Headquarters, onsite daycare is available to assist working parents in balancing professional and parenting priorities. The center offers full- and part-time early education and preschool, drop-in care, emergency-care, and a school-age summer camp.

How We Manage
People
The past few years have been ones of growth for Campbell’s 
commitment to WD&I. We took significant enterprise-wide steps to further integrate diversity and inclusion as a business imperative. Highlights include launching:
• Our newest employee id Network called Roots, aimed 
at engaging Campbell employees on real food and 
sustainability;• Executive roundtables, focused on engagement and 
retention of black talent; and
• Collaboration between our Campbell id Networks and 
our marketing and talent teams leveraging the diversity of our workforce to foster stronger consumer and talent connections. To better meet the needs of America’s increasingly diverse global population, our workforce should mirror the increasing diversity of our consumers. We keep our finger on the pulse of diversity trends in the marketplace in order to help us create an authentic connection with our current and future employees. According to the most recent U.S. Census, ethnic groups will account for 85 percent of the population growth through 2050. In today’s workforce, 40 percent are women, 20 percent are people with disabilities and 10 percent are people who identify as LGBT. 
Understanding how to adapt our business to this changing consumer landscape, and adapting our Workforce Diversity 
& Inclusion (WD&I) strategy accordingly, is critical to our ability to achieve high performance and fulfill our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments. We continue to concentrate on cultivating leadership and employee capabilities and awareness around diversity and inclusion, while enriching our culture and employee engagement through our Campbell id Networks that are focused on elevating our collective culture and consciousness.Material Issue
DIVERSITY & INCLUSION
 
2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 
2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTPEOPLE  |  61Our Progress
Building on our momentum, we are well positioned 
to accelerate our journey toward a more authentic culture of diversity and inclusion. To drive continuous improvement, we are conducting a root cause analysis with the goal of creating a deeply comprehensive data-driven, integrated strategy which will drive accountability, ownership and sustainable results.
As we continue on our journey to inclusion, we are increasing our capabilities to attract and retain talent reflective of our consumers and working to transform our culture. As we do so, we are enabling leaders  
and employees to unite around several key growth areas. These include Positioning for Growth; Building Awareness and Capability; Engaging Leaders, Talent and Creating Community; and Fostering Future Women and Minority Leaders. 
Positioning for Growth
We have integrated WD&I into the Global Talent Management Center of Excellence, helping to build synergies, increase efficiencies and eliminate silos across the enterprise. These enhanced collaborations, centered on attracting talent (sourcing and recruiter training), manager empowerment and engagement (toolkits and key messages) and talent growth and retention (development programs for high-performing team members) continue to drive positive results. 
Building Awareness & Capability 
Creating a culture of inclusion does not happen overnight. We are investing in teaching our employees about their unconscious biases and increasing their levels of self-awareness in order to change behavior. Currently, we are working to integrate diversity and inclusion competencies into our core manager and people training including Manager Excellence, Selection and our new Values Curriculum.
Engaging Leaders, Talent & Creating Community
We drive leadership and management engagement and accountability through a variety of touch points. These include WD&I-focused leadership meetings, constant coordination with human resources leadership and business partners and trickle-down communication of key diversity and inclusion messages from enterprise leadership. Fostering Future Women & Minority Leaders
Looking to ensure the next generation of Campbell leaders, we invited 30 students from Camden Academy Charter High School to our World Headquarters in FY2016 as part of the third annual global STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) Career Accelerator Day. The program is part of a global campaign aimed to expose and excite 10,000 students in grades eight through 12 to engage with STEM careers through an experiential visit and interaction with professionals. 
A particular focus for the global program is to engage 
young women and students from minority backgrounds to consider STEM careers. This unique opportunity not only engages and inspires students who have an interest in STEM, but also allows Campbell, as an employer, the opportunity to help frame the curriculum and develop the skills needed for future STEM roles and potential future candidates. 
As an advocate for mentoring future women leaders  
in business, in FY2016 we hosted cooking classes and educational learning sessions for Women of the Dream, a nonprofit organization focused on developing African-American girls to help them achieve careers and healthy, productive lifestyles through workshops, mentoring, networking and scholarships. The program has the potential to make a profound impact in our hometown of Camden for the next generation of women.

Board Gender Diversity
It is important that our Board of Directors reflect the diversity of our marketplace. In 2016, we were honored by a leading organization focused on advancing women’s leadership, the Women’s Forum of New York. At their 
Breakfast of Corporate Champions, the Women’s Forum 
of New York named Campbell a “corporate game changer” 
for having at least 20 percent female representation on its Board of Directors. In FY2016, four females sat on Campbell’s 12-member Board, including one executive.
Legacy of LGBT Advocacy 
Ensuring and respecting diversity and creating an 
inclusive workplace will continue to be key to unlocking 
our potential. In 2016, we received a perfect score for 
the seventh year on the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) 
Foundation’s annual Corporate Equality Index and 
earned a spot on the HRC’s 2017 Buying Guide for 
Equality — a guide to businesses, products and services that support LGBT equality. These awards are evidence of our commitment to being one of the nation’s top 
places where employees can confidently bring their 
whole selves to work. 
The Financial Times, in partnership with OUTstanding, 
an LGBT network for business leaders and allies, named Campbell’s Bethmara Kessler, Senior Vice President of 
Integrated Global Services, to the Top 100 Leading 
LGBT+ Executives list, and Ed Carolan, President of 
Campbell Fresh, to the Top 30 Leading Ally Executives list for 2016. To be named to the OUTstanding Top 100, each nominee was judged by the following criteria: 
activities undertaken to make the workplace a more 
welcoming place; activities a nominee is involved with 
outside of the workplace that help to achieve positive change for LGBT people; recent business achievements; and seniority and influence in the business. Kessler 
serves as the Business Advisor for Campbell’s OPEN 
network and Carolan serves as the Executive Sponsor. 
 “As the first woman to lead Campbell in our 145-year history, I feel that I have 
a responsibility to serve as a role model and mentor for young women and 
help them open doors of opportunity. I want all of you [student mentees] 
to know that the women in this room stand with you as you begin a journey 
that can change your lives and help set you on the path to a fulfilling and 
rewarding life. We’re here to help you soar!”

With the vision of an injury-free workplace and the goal to 
achieve world-class safety performance, Campbell has a global strategy for safety leadership, employee engagement and robust foundational safety systems across the entire Campbell network. The Global Safety Leadership Team has established the direction and leads implementation  
of the plan, which includes:
•  The development and implementation of global 
safety standards, including technology and online tools that clearly and consistently communicate safety programs to our global workforce.•  Annual safety audits, which are conducted at each 
operating location to measure compliance and global safety strategic plan progress. The main focus is meaningful safety engagement on the manufacturing floor and ensuring a safe and healthy working environment.Ensuring that employees, contractors and visitors get home safely to their families and friends each and every day is core to our business. We work hard to go beyond the legal requirements to protect those who work at and visit our global locations. We believe in creating a workplace culture that respects and protects the well-being of each individual with the mindset that nothing is more important than your own safety and the safety of those around you. With this philosophy in mind, we have made good progress around injury reduction and have set aggressive targets to achieve an injury-free workplace.Material Issue

Safety Results
Campbell’s focus on safety has continually produced 
results that exceed industry benchmarks and averages. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor, our industry averaged 1.3 lost-time incidents for every 200,000 hours worked through 2015. In FY2016, Campbell’s rate was 0.23, well below the 2015 industry average. In FY2016, Campbell’s occupational injury and illness frequency rate per 200,000 hours was 1.96. In comparison, the 2015 industry average was 4.8. Campbell will continue on our journey to zero injuries with the expectation to reach a world-class safety performance rate of less than 1.0 as our next significant milestone achievement. 
Recognizing Safety Achievements
Beyond tracking and improving injury and illness rates, Campbell recognizes employees and teams when important safety milestones are achieved. Our Safety Flag Program recognizes Campbell facilities that have reached zero lost-time injuries for at least one year or worked more than 1 million hours. Today, 12 of Campbell’s 35 manufacturing sites proudly fly the Safety Flag, many with the gold Campbell “C” added for reaching additional million-hour milestones. Additionally, Campbell’s Living Our Purpose Award recognizes Campbell facilities each year for their ongoing efforts that put safety above all else and make significant contributions through implementation of new and innovative safety processes, systems or best practices, as demonstrated by exceptional safety results or accomplishments. The FY2016 winning plant was Richmond, Utah, for passing the seven-year mark with a reportable incident rate below the world-class standard of 1.0, thanks in large part to the "Red Belt" safety team's relentless efforts to drive safety engagement and affect culture change to a zero-accident mindset.Safety leadership at all levels is critical in creating a safe 
workplace. Employee engagement and safety system 
ownership is equally important to maintain and improve 
safety in all our operations. Management leads with 
“safety first,” and employees must be trained and fully engaged in our safety processes.

How We Manage
We have developed two goals that support this focused 
lens. By 2020, Campbell is committed to measurably improving the health of young people in our hometown communities by reducing childhood obesity and hunger by 50 percent. In addition, we seek to make a positive impact on the lives of youth through our volunteer, community and signature programs.In our effort to help our local communities thrive, Campbell utilizes four strategic approaches in our community efforts:
• Social impact;
• Innovation;• Employee engagement; and• Strategic investment and in-kind giving.What we do every day matters. At Campbell, we believe we have a fundamental responsibility to help our local 
communities thrive. Investing in our community and supporting our neighbors matters to us as a company, it matters to our employees and it matters to the people who are the fabric of the communities where we live and work. It is this commitment and our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments, that guide our community efforts. 
Our Purpose is based on a set of unwavering beliefs, that food should be delicious, accessible and affordable — 
all three — without compromise. As a food company, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our capabilities and expertise to increase food access in communities where we have operations, and we center our community efforts 
on this issue.Material Issue

We believe real change happens not just in philanthropic 
giving, but in the power of combining financial investments with the passion and skills of our employees, our capabilities as a food company, and the commitment and engagement of local community leaders and organizations. Together, we are driving innovation in food access and in local community issues where we have operations. 
Social Impact
Access to fresh, nutritious and affordable food is a hallmark of our collective impact program, Campbell’s Healthy Communities, which operates in our hometown communities to address issues of food security, nutrition education, health and well-being. Camden, New Jersey, a town of 77,000 residents and home of Campbell’s World Headquarters, has only one full-service grocery store and was our initial focus. This $10 million, 10-year initiative is directed toward measurably improving the health of young people in our hometown communities. In the past five years, the effort has expanded its footprint from Camden to our Pepperidge Farm headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut; two manufacturing facilities in Napoleon, Ohio, and Everett, Washington; as well as Metro Detroit, near the Ferndale, Michigan, headquarters of our most recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet.
Campbell’s Healthy Communities is focused on four key 
areas — food access, physical activity and access, nutrition education and public will. The core of the program is the collective impact approach. In Camden, 11 investee organizations work together on a common agenda with shared measurement systems, mutually reinforcing activities and continuous communication. This approach is reinforced by a leadership organization which drives the work and creates long-term sustainability for the program.We understand that food access and nutrition education are only two pieces of the complicated health puzzle. By increasing access to physical activity programs and combining those efforts with healthy eating, Campbell’s 
Healthy Communities participants are seeing measurable differences in their BMI percentiles. An example is Camden’s Soccer for Success program, which operates 14 sites with nearly 900 participants each year. In 2016, Soccer for Success total hours equaled 33,593 among the participants.
We view Campbell’s Healthy Communities as more than 
just a social impact program — it is about the innovative approach to making lasting change in our local communities. We don’t have all the answers, and not every initiative we have tried has worked, but what is unique about the program is its ability to learn from our mistakes and, most importantly, course-correct with the input and guidance of our program sites and community partners. As we learn, we share our structure and changes with our newest Campbell’s Healthy Communities locations, 
enabling them to become champions of change in measurably improving the health of young people in our hometown communities.

PEOPLE  |  69Innovation
For Campbell, innovation is the key to success, both  
in our business as a food company and in our work as  
a corporate citizen. As we strive to create healthy communities and make nutritious food available to those  
in need, we must think outside the can. Campbell has 
been doing just that through the creation of buy one,  
give one products such as The Soulfull Project and  
Plum® Super Smoothie and products that donate  
profits to charity such as Just Peachy salsa.
The Soulfull Project
The Soulfull Project, Campbell’s second public benefit 
corporation, is a mission-focused start-up dedicated to making high-quality, nutritious food more accessible to those in need and increasing community engagement.
For every serving of its delicious multi-grain hot cereal 
purchased, the company donates a serving of its 4 Grain 
Blend to a food bank in that region. The company, which launched in August 2016 in Camden, New Jersey, has committed to expanding their network to include more than 200 food banks across the country. In just under  
a year, The Soulfull Project has donated more than 42,000 servings of its nutrient-dense hot cereal and logged over 700 volunteer hours in the community.Just Peachy
What do you get when you combine a growing  
food insecure population in southern New Jersey,  
an increased demand for services at the Food Bank  
of South Jersey, passionate Campbell employees and excess but nutritionally sound peaches headed for landfill? Just Peachy salsa, of course.
Developed in 2012, Just Peachy salsa utilizes some  
of the 800,000 pounds of peaches thrown away each 
year (due to being undersized or slightly blemished) by just one farmer’s cooperative in southern New 
Jersey. When the Food Bank of South Jersey had an 
idea to create a shelf-stable product to sell at retail,  
a team of Campbell volunteers jumped right in. They 
developed the recipe and manufacturing process and even got 12 Campbell suppliers to donate packaging and 
ingredients. In addition, Campbell employees volunteered 
to box the salsa to ready it for distribution.
In the five years since the creation of Just Peachy, the 
Food Bank of South Jersey has grossed more than $300,000 in revenue that supports its nine hunger relief programs. The product is sold at New Jersey retail outlets, including farmer’s markets, restaurants and select ShopRite stores. 
The Full Effect
®
Plum was founded on the belief that every child 
deserves the very best food from the very first bite. More than 16 million children in the U.S., or one in five, are food insecure and don’t have access to regular meals. Not only that, but it is recognized that ages  
0 to 3 are the most critical years developmentally for children. Plum launched The Full Effect in 2013 — a produce-to-donate initiative dedicated to nourishing little ones in need throughout the U.S. The Full Effect name comes from the fundamental belief that when little ones are full of the right nutrients, they can live up to their full potential and have their full effect on the world. 
One of the signature initiatives of The Full Effect is a 
Super Smoothie pouch made with accessible organic 
superfoods, including fruits, vegetables and grains, that help fortify the diets of kids who don’t get regular healthy meals. In 2014, Plum launched the Super Smoothie as a buy-give product at retail — for every four-pack purchased, a Super Smoothie was donated to a little one in need.
With the help of Plum’s supply chain and nonprofit 
partners, the company donated more than 729,000 Super Smoothies in FY2016. Donations of Super Smoothie and other Plum products reach children  
in need across the country through a small group  
of extraordinary nonprofit partners, including Conscious Alliance, Convoy of Hope and the Homeless Prenatal Program.

At Campbell, our people are at the core of what we do. In 
our effort to drive community work that matters, we rely on the skills and passion of our employees. Volunteerism occurs year-round at Campbell, with more than 12,000 
U.S. volunteer hours tracked in FY2016. These efforts are 
supported by Dollars for Doers, a program that recognizes 
and encourages employee volunteerism. For every 25 hours an employee volunteers, the partner nonprofit receives a $500 grant. In FY2016, 93 Dollars for Doers grants were 
awarded totaling $159,500. 
During Campbell’s annual week of service, Make a 
Difference Week, employees from across the company come together to help our local communities thrive. In FY2016, more than 3,700 Campbell employees from across 17 locations in the U.S. participated in 110 projects focused on building healthy communities and driving 
food access. Some of those projects are profiled below.
Focused, year-round volunteering takes place with 
Feeding America, its member food banks and affiliated agencies. In most areas where Campbell has a facility, we’ve established a steady volunteer partnership with 
the local Feeding America food bank — sorting and 
boxing food, leading cooking and nutrition classes and 
even providing capacity-building support through board service. In FY2016, nearly 25 percent of Campbell’s total volunteer hours were dedicated to Feeding America 
food banks and their member agencies.
In Camden, New Jersey, volunteers created an educational 
community garden for thousands of youth and their families, prepared thousands of meals for homeless patrons at several soup kitchens, and built 66 raised garden beds at the Center for Environmental Transformation.
In Maxton, North Carolina, the Maxton Community Team 
consistently volunteers. A sample of FY2016 service projects include the raising of a Habitat for Humanity home, funds raised for diabetes, and the collection and donation of shoes for Haitian earthquake and hurricane survivors.
Across 16 manufacturing facilities, employees packed and 
donated backpacks full of food to kids in need. These kids participate in the National School Lunch program during the school week, but do not know where their next meal is coming from on the weekend.
In Everett, Washington, the Collective Impact Team provided 
123 volunteer hours to Packs for Kids ensuring access to weekend food for at-risk children as well as generating a $1,000 Dollars for Doers grant for the organization.FY2016 EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT HIGHLIGHTS

Strategic Investment & In-Kind Giving
At Campbell, we believe that impact is generated, not simply by giving grants, but also by strategic investment in long-term partnerships in focused priority areas.
In the U.S., Campbell is the largest contributor to the 
United Way in many of the communities where we have operations. Support of the United Way and its work is high, with participation rates topping 98 percent in our Camden, New Jersey, World Headquarters in FY2016. Overall, 14 Campbell and Pepperidge Farm locations hosted giving campaigns last year, with employee contributions totaling nearly $1 million. Coupled with a match from the Campbell Soup Foundation, United Way organizations across the country received almost $1.45 million to support its focus areas of education, income and health, including bridging the food access gap for those who need it most.
In Australia, the employee-funded Arnott’s Foundation 
focuses its giving on creating positive environments and healthy communities that allow Australian families to build, maintain and enjoy a better quality of life. The main beneficiary of the Arnott’s Foundation is Camp Quality, which provides support to the families of children diagnosed with cancer. In FY2016, the Arnott’s Foundation provided AU$675,000 to Camp Quality, which funded the Family Camp Program benefiting hundreds of Australian families. This total represented a 58 percent increase in employee donations over FY2015.As a food company, our products are one of our greatest assets. Partnering with organizations like Feeding America, Campbell donates more than $50 million in in-kind product annually through direct agency donations and reclamation. Providing access to our nourishing food, especially to those who need it most, is one critical way we help our local communities thrive. 
Campbell Canada continued its multiyear commitment 
with Food Banks Canada in FY2016, providing more than 2 million pounds of food to support food-insecure Canadian families.People

Kelsen was acquired in August 2013 and Garden Fresh Gourmet was acquired in June 2015. Our environmental data has been restated back to the base year of 2008 to include the Bolthouse Farms, Plum, Kelsen and Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisitions. The metrics and goals in this report are established and measured by the Campbell business units and corporate functions that are responsible for achieving them. This is done in consultation with internal and,  
in some cases, external stakeholders, as well as by reference to external benchmarks and leadership practices. Our goal is to deliver a useful and accurate description of our performance. Given our rapidly changing business, the number of acquisitions and divestitures, and the limited data from the acquired acquisitions, we are currently working to reevaluate some of our long-term performance goals and have shared some of these updates in this Report. 
In 2015, we successfully completed a third-party limited 
assurance review consistent with guidance provided by ISO 14064-3 of our GHG emissions inventory. This assurance process was under the supervision of the Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability. We did not complete third-party assurance of other sections of the Report.

HCFC refrigerants, which are mainly found in our bakery operations. Three bakeries in the U.S. have been converted to ammonia refrigerant-based systems. The company has plans to convert our remaining five U.S. bakeries and three Australian bakeries. One of those facilities will be converted by 2017 and the remaining by 2020.

Genetically Modified Ingredients
What is the company’s position on genetically 
modified (GMO) ingredients?One of the most hotly debated topics within the issue  of transparency in the U.S. is the labeling of GMOs. An overwhelming majority of U.S. consumers today believe 
that they have the right to know what is in their food 
and we agree. That’s why, in FY2016, we formally 
announced our support for the enactment of federal legislation in the U.S. to establish a single mandatory labeling standard for foods derived from GMOs. 
 
The decisions we have made with regard to GMOs have 
not been because we dispute the science behind GMOs or their safety. The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence indicates that GMOs are safe and that foods derived from crops using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. Ingredients derived from these crops are in many of our products and we will continue to use them. We also believe that technology will play a crucial role in feeding the world. For us, it is simply a matter of transparency.
Public Policy
Does the company actively participate in the 
discussion of local, state, national and international public policy issues?Yes. We engage in issues that are relevant to our business strategies and operations, from food safety and advertising to health insurance and international trade. We also contribute to public dialogue on policy issues through our memberships in food and related industry trade associations and coalitions. Committed to industry-wide transparency, we emphasize candid dialogue and open interactions with government agencies and officials.Does the company have policies for political engagement and does it disclose political contributions?Yes, Campbell is recognized as a leader in political accountability. Campbell’s U.S. lobbying disclosure reports are filed with the appropriate state and federal authorities under the U.S. Lobby Disclosure Act. We also file disclosure reports with the Election Law Enforcement Commission for lobbying activity with the State of New Jersey. Campbell has a formal set of Political Accountability Guidelines and related disclosures, which are available on the company’s public website. Our public disclosures include Campbell’s top public policy issues and politically-related expenditures.
In the U.S., Campbell does not endorse any individual 
political party or candidate, but we do encourage voluntary political activity by our employees. Our employees can contribute funds to political candidates and organizations engaged in policy issues that are important to our company, such as food manufacturing standards and tax reform, through Campbell’s Political Action Committee (PAC), a segregated fund that is affiliated with the company. Contributions made by the Campbell PAC are publicly reported, in accordance with federal law. To view the Campbell PAC’s disclosures of contributions and expenditures to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), visit the FEC website.
