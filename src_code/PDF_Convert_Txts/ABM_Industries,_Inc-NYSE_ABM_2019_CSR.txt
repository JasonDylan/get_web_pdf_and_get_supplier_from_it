2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT2[102-14] STA TEMENT SENIOR DECISION MAKER 
The past few months have been difficult for for all of us. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, public spaces and businesses 
have closed, people have lost their jobs, many lives have been lost, and countless more have been sickened. Leading a 
company whose team members are on the front lines fighting COVID-19 has been challenging and rewarding at the same 
time. Keeping our workers safe has been our top priority. 
I would like to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams who are working hard to keep our clients 
healthier. They have been real heroes in this battle and the least we can do is make sure they have what they need to 
continue performing their jobs safely. As such, I am proud to announce that ABM has joined the Cleaning Coalition of 
America in order to ensure that the needs of our industry (one that has played a vital role in keeping essential businesses 
operational) are well represented. 
Being part of the gatekeepers to help reopen America represents for us an unprecedented opportunity to come back 
stronger than ever with a strong value proposition for our clients: environmental sustainability. We are committed 
to practices that will leave behind a healthier planet for our children . We are also aware of the huge opportunity that 
bringing sustainable solutions to the market and performing sustainable operations represent. 
2019 marked a banner year for our sustainability journey and prepared us to better support our clients in low carbon 
economy transitions. Through our sustainable solutions portfolio, including our GreenCare program of environmentally 
friendly cleaning services, we’re positioned to be our clients’ partner in achieving their facilities-related sustainability 
goals. We have strengthened our portfolio of sustainable solutions to effectively mitigate climate change risks and 
will continue to do so. So far, during 2019 we have reduced more than 247,269.58 MWh across our clients’ facilities, 
supported fleet electrification with more than 500 electrical vehicle charging stations installations, and reduced 
over 90,000 tons of CO2e emissions through the installation of the charging stations and the provision of our Energy 
Performance Contracting services .
Finally, just in the same way that we advocate for sustainability on our clients’ behalf through our sustainable solutions, 
we aim to bring consistency to our internal efforts and in the way we manage our own operations. Conducting business 
in a sustainable way is a priority. In this report, we illustrate our efforts to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our 
workers, how we engage in responsible business operations, and how we manage our own environmental footprint. 
I hope you will join us as we work to ensure a healthier planet. I look forward to seeing our continuous improvements year 
over year!

In order to ensure transparency across our corporate sustainability analysis, ABM has partnered for the eighth year in a row 
with the Center of Sustainability Excellence to perform its materiality analysis and publish an independent audit assessment. 
In order to build our materiality matrix, we distributed a survey with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) list of material 
topics and asked both our internal (team members, executives) and external (clients, vendors) stakeholders to rank them. 
This year’s assessment included new topics such as human rights, waste generation and market presence. The final matrix

GreenCare  – Our Portfolio of Sustainable Solutions for Our Clients’ Facilities 
As part of our sustainability strategy, ABM is strongly committed to adding value 
to clients through our sustainable solutions portfolio. Buildings represent a sizable 
portion of cities’ overall greenhouse gas emissions inventories, so it must be a 
priority to operate them in a more environmentally friendly way. We aim to become 
a key strategic partner for our clients to achieve their sustainability goals. ABM has designed solutions to increase waste 
diversion rates from landfills, conducted energy efficiency retrofits, installed on-site renewable generation, and used 
green cleaning supplies.
We have built a strong reputation in part by continually striving to improve upon our client service offerings through the 
ABM GreenCare® program. As a member of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), we also continue to offer specific 
products and procedures for buildings to maintain and improve their LEED certifications. 
Our expertise in providing sustainable services: 
• Our clients have saved more than 90,000 tons of CO2e and 247,269.58 MWh of energy consumption through our 
Energy Performance Contracting services.
• We are one of the largest installers of electrical vehicle charging stations in the U.S. So far, we have installed more 
than 16,500 EV charging stations. 
• Our green cleaning program has been implemented in more than 361 million square feet across our clients’ offices. 
We have serviced over 450 USGBC LEED-certified and registered sites. 
2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT19
DOING BUSINESS IN A RESPONSIBLE WA YHOW WE HELP OUR CLIENTS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE 
Helping Our Clients to Achieve Carbon Neutrality 
• Electrical Vehicle Charging Stations: As one of the leading installers of EV charging stations, ABM has installed more 
than 16,500 EV charging ports. ABM’s partnership with multiple market leaders of EV hardware and network providers 
allows us to offer the first all-inclusive, affordable charging service plan to our clients.
• Electrical Fleet: ABM supports our client’s’ transition to electric vehicles. We are on top of the latest market 
developments in order to provide the cleanest transportation services to our clients. 
• Solar panels and glass: We help our clients understand that solar has become a viable financial solution for companies. 
ABM enables facilities to benefit from the financial and environmental benefits of solar power generation and assists 
with the design, installation, financing, and operation of the systems. 
• Energy Performance Contracting:  As an accredited member of the National Association of Energy Companies, ABM 
improves energy efficiency across our clients’ buildings, which reduces energy demand and the associated carbon 
emissions. Importantly, our all-in approach (compared to traditional facility upgrades)  also helps clients lower costs for 
HV AC, mechanical, electrical, and lighting.
• Carbon capture and Storage: We offer carbon capture and recycle solutions for our clients to contribute to the circular 
economy and convert carbon into concrete.
Green Cleaning Program 
ABM maintains a customizable, environmentally friendly cleaning program that helps clients 
achieve credit points under the USGBC LEED v4 Building Operations and Maintenance 
Green Building Rating System. We have partnered with our chemicals, paper, and 
equipment suppliers to provide products with green certification to our clients, 
such as the Green Seal, EcoLogo, Green Guard and the Forest Stewardship Council. 
ABM’s janitorial team has also been trained to apply the company’s standards and 
provide services that follow our clients’ cleaning policies. These measures improve 
the indoor environmental quality and positively contribute to the health and 
productivity of building occupants. 
Improving Waste Diversion from Landfill 
ABM’s waste management services have proven to increase our client’s’ waste 
diversion rates, reduce operation costs and achieve LEED and True Zero Waste 
certification credit points. We offer services like:
• Waste audits: We help our clients identify current, true and potential waste diversion rates 
that will help determine costs and environmental savings from the implementation of different 
initiatives.
• Solid waste data tracking and monitoring: We can provide monthly-customized reports via KPI dashboards that 
highlight cost savings from program impacts and the resulting return on investments. 
• On-site trash sorting program:  Dedicated people on-site to pull out recyclable and compostable materials from landfill 
and end facilities recycle contamination. 
• Program management and tenant engagement: ABM can provide customized programs signage, implement waste 
reduction and recycling initiatives, and promote best practices for waste disposal and personalized audits.

Victoria Leeds, a shopping and leisure area in England’s Leeds City Centre, wanted to increase the recycling rate of 
its commercial facilities. T o make this happen, ABM appointed a zero-waste champion to improve the facility’s waste 
management procedures.
Thanks to initiatives led by ABM’s zero-waste champion like retailers’ engagement campaigns, programs to collect wasted 
coffee materials, optimized waste centralization efforts and installation of food digestors, Victoria Leeds increased to 97% 
its waste diversion from landfill, surpassing the company’s original target of 90%. As a result, they won a Green Apple Award 
for efforts to improve waste diversion. Read the full case study here .
Reducing Southern California Federal Buildings’ Energy and Operating Costs by Nearly $50 million 
ABM has been contracted with GSA under a stand-alone Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC). The energy efficiency 
improvements implemented at GSA facilities included replacing retro commissioning heating and cooling equipment 
with state-of-the-art systems and low load chillers to provide more fresh air to the buildings occupants, updating building 
automation controls and installing LED lighting and solar windows, among others. Our solutions guaranteed GSA savings of 
at least $48.4 million in energy and operating costs over the next 20 years by reducing the building’s energy use by 38%. Read

centralized waste, we reach out to the San Francisco Unified School District to pick up the bins. That way, the bins are being 
reused and not tossed out for disposal. In total, we have donated more than 1,000 deskside bins, and the school district 
reported that all recycling bins are in the classrooms. Achieving LEED Certification for JFK Terminal 4
T erminal 4 at John F . Kennedy International Airport is the first air terminal in the U.S. to be awarded the LEED Gold certification 
by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for the category of existing buildings. ABM’s janitorial team was able to design and 
launch the ABM GreenCare™ program to achieve credit points in the certification’s Indoor Environmental Quality section. Read

ABM uses strategic supplier partnerships to provide a capable, modern supply chain that allows ABM team members to 
receive the same products used to service our clients in the most responsible manner. 
ABM’s Supplier Code of Conduct – Using Environmental and Social Criteria for Screening Our Suppliers
We have established the ABM Supplier Code of Conduct to ensure that suppliers – including subcontractors that 
provide services directly to ABM’s clients – uphold the company’s policies. These requirements cover compliance with 
all applicable local laws, respect for human rights, environmental conservation, and safeguarding the safety of all of the 
products and services we provide.
Our suppliers shall maintain all required environmental permits and Safety Data Sheets, as well as keep a record of the 
solid waste, wastewater and air emissions generated by their operations. At the same time, they should strive to reduce all 
types of waste generation, including water and energy consumption, as an overall strategy to implement environmentally 
friendly business practices. In addition, ABM suppliers shall strictly prohibit any form of corruption, adhere to fair business 
practice standards, and comply with any applicable anti-corruption law.
Partnering With Our Suppliers For Sustainable Procurement Practices
We are constantly identifying new products and methods to operate more efficiently for our 
clients, while staying at the forefront of the most innovative sustainable practices. As an 
example, we have a strong relationship with Diversey, our industry leading chemical 
supplier. Both companies have partnered together to implement sustainability initiatives 
across all of ABM’s value chain. Diversey’s latest innovations in packaging and chemical 
concentrations have reduced ABM shipping volumes by an equivalent of 40 truckloads 
over 2019, which has offset about 362,000 kgCO2e of carbon emissions.*
Promoting Supplier Diversity 
ABM recognizes the importance of maintaining supplier diversity. We are committed to 
providing minority-owned, women-owned, as well as disabled veteran-owned (MWDVE) 
businesses direct access to subcontractor opportunities and procurement bids. We strongly 
believe that a robust and diverse supplier base not only helps ABM’s competitiveness in the 
marketplace, but also fuels the economic vitality across all sectors in our industry. 
ABM actively participates in supplier diversity initiatives. As an example, 
ABM has provided janitorial services to a large national client for several years now 
and has offered support to MWDVE enterprises in business development practices 
through ABM’s mentoring program. Our extensive trainings and introductions to the 
latest cleaning techniques, supplies and equipment have all played a major role in 
the success stories where we subcontracted MWDVE companies.

ABM utilizes a multi-layer approach for identifying and addressing data risks. Utilizing tools that aggregate and then 
auto-remediate are the main focus of ABM where we are able to detect and remediate many risks within minutes. We use 
internal and external tools and resources to watch and respond to ID and data risks. 
We have been at the forefront for ensuring full compliance with all the newest laws and guidelines brought from General 
Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act and all new guidelines and laws for personal information and

ABM’s  mission to make a difference, every person, every day, is evidenced in our approach to risk management and safety. 
Our programs are designed not only to ensure compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
and other regulatory bodies, but also to protect the health and welfare of our team members, clients, and client’s clients. 
The cornerstone of ABM’s comprehensive risk management and safety program is safety awareness to ensure our team 
members are:
Our ThinkSafe approach to safety includes establishing a safety mindset from day one of T eam Members employment 
by focusing on ABM’s Safety Absolutes. This safety culture is continuously reinforced throughout the T eam Members 
journey through daily Moments for Safety messages, monthly training topics, and unique programs and materials created 
for our T eam Members; like safety playbooks, which contain specific information about how to prevent certain types of 
work place injuries, how to proactively address potentially catastrophic situation such as hurricanes or tornadoes, and 
refreshers on the ABM’s Safety Absolutes. 
One of the cornerstones of our ThinkSafe program is to partner with operations to provide leaders the ability to identify 
workplace hazards and implement changes to prevent an accident or injury. Through ABM’s “Frontline Leader Training” , 
leaders are guided as to how to create a culture of caring with Leadership Engagement T ours (LET s) and Safe Work 
Observations Program (SWOPs) participation to help ensure the health and welfare of our T eam Members and clients. The 
Frontline Leader Training also provides guidance on what to do should a claim occur to ensure T eam Members receive the

Health and Safety Policy 
Safety at ABM starts with a strong partnership 
with Operations and a local presence.  As such, the 
safety organization is comprised of Safety Managers 
embedded within our Industry Groups, though Safety 
does report centrally to the Vice President of Risk 
Management and Safety.  This deployment of safety 
resources allows Safety Managers to create custom 
Industry Group solutions to safety challenges that 
arise out of Operations and to ensure all safety 
activities are aligned with ABM corporate goals and 
objectives. This approach allows the Risk & Safety 
group the ability to adapt our safety program to 
include client safety requirements and oversee the 
safety activities of subcontractors. 
Increasing Awareness 
ABM programs are designed to increase the safety 
acumen of our staff. We deliver tailored trainings to 
our Team Members based on their job requirements, 
hazards identified through site assessments, and 
OSHA and client mandated training topics. These 
topics are delivered through interaction with the Team 
Members Manager. They can be delivered via Moment 
for Safety messages in a pre-shift meeting, weekly 
safety briefings, and/or tailored safety programs 
for all service lines. These safety interactions are 
documented for regular safety audits and inspections, 
including on-site client reviews. 
The Results
Safety programs for FY2019 produced the fourth 
consecutive year of claim frequency reductions.  ABM’s 
continued attention to safety and aggressive claim 
management has sustained our Experience Mod Rating 
(EMR) of .98 and an OSHA Frequency rate of 3.08.  
For FY2019, ABM was issued four OSHA Citations 
of Serious and three Other than Serious General 
Regulatory.  Corrective actions were implemented to 
address the issues outlined in the citations.

Team Member Engagement – Y ourVoice Program 
At ABM, every voice matters. We completed for the first time the ABMVoice team member engagement survey as part of 
one of our 2020 vision goals, which was being able to implement changes that will improve our experience at the company. 
This engagement survey seeks to understand team members’ engagement with their teams, work, and the organization. 
T eam members were asked to rate 25 items on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Overall, we found 
that ABM’s team members are highly engaged. T o help ABM focus on our efforts to increase engagement, the data showed 
that if focused on our Drivers of Engagement, ABM can increase our engagement. 
We received more than 27,000 responses from our team members (60% of our team members with email and 17% of our 
service workers). As a result, we identified the following Drivers of Engagement (with favorability scores): 
Our Executive Leadership T eam wanted the organization’s leaders, down to the region level, to focus on our lowest 
favorability scores. ABM senior leaders  value people as the most important part of the business and seek out professional 
growth and career development opportunities for them. Partnering with Human Resources, regional leaders identified 
actions to take to improve engagement in these key areas. 
Our Back to the Floor Program 
Every year, ABM U.K. runs a month of “Back to the Floor” where we encourage our people 
to experience a day in the life of our frontline team members around the U.K. The Board of 
Directors leads the way, spending time with our colleagues and gaining a greater insight 
into their day to day duties and the challenges they face. This year, our team members were

Our Carbon Footprint
ABM recognizes the role we have that the company plays on limiting the impact of the environment. We are currently 
working on strengthening our environmental reporting processes and have increased the sites reporting and type of 
information we need. 
During the 2020 fiscal year, we plan to commit to the Science Based T argets (SBT s) initiative that consists on setting a 
carbon reduction target in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. Building on work done in previous years we will be setting 
these targets and setting a carbon reduction pathway with detailed actions. 
ABM’s overall carbon footprint increased by 1.44%. This can be explained by an increase in the use of natural gas and of the 
fuel consumption. On the other hand, we saw a slight decrease in the electricity consumption that can be explained by an 
increase in the procurement of renewable electricity at our U.K. sites. 
For technical information about the information presented on the tables, please refer to page 45 . 
Our Carbon Reduction Goals 
ABM is seeking to reduce its metric tons of GHG emissions 
from its scope 1 and 2 per FTE equivalent by 15% from our 
2011-year baseline (0.67 T ons of CO2  /FTE) by 2020. This 
includes purchased electricity, fleet fuel usage and natural 
gas used at our office locations. 
During 2019, the company reduced by 0.3% its metric tons of 
CO2e per FTE intensity reporting an intensity of 0.54 metric 
tons of CO2e per FTE reaching and surpassing its carbon 
reduction goal. Because of this, the company will renew 
its targets in the short term and plans to commit with the 
Science Based T arget initiative.  Source Consumption (MWh)

CHANGE
 [102-11] PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE APPROACH   |  [102-15] KEY IMPACTS, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES  |  [302] ENERGY MANAGEMENT APPROACH 
In addition to mitigating the effects of climate change, ABM continuously evaluates the risks and opportunities that 
climate change represents for us and for our clients. Potential climate change impacts are identified, assessed and 
managed as part of ABM’s enterprise risk review, which is reported to the Board of Directors. The company’s management 
and its Board of Directors continuously monitor the company’s risk profile, including with respect to climate-related risks.
Risks Related to ClimateChange
Policy, Regulations and Energy Prices 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or local laws regulating topics such as discharge of materials 
into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. As an example, ABM U.K. is subject to 
the climate change levy that requires the company to report its GHG emissions. Also, some of ABM’s energy efficiency 
projects are subject to federal and state legislation and policies that support those kinds of projects. 
Ineffective compliance with current laws and regulations could impact our reputation or generate financial fines that 
could increase the costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of our operations. T o ensure compliance, 
we maintain an environmental policy that provides guidelines on discharge into soil, water,and air, and the generation, 
handling, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. 
Technology
Peers implementing the latest cleaning and technical solutions related technologies can impact our contract retention 
and revenues. T o manage this risk, ABM’s Strategy department is constantly looking at the latest innovation trends to 
ensure we provide to our clients the best technology available in the market. Also, regarding our own operations, we have 
designed a roadmap to increase the electrification of our fleet.  
Market
Clients have expressed an increased interest for sustainability-related services that could help them to improve their 
sustainability performance, including reduction of energy consumption and waste generation. Inability to provide such 
services could impact our client retention rates. T o manage this risk, ABM has put in place its GreenCare portfolio of 
sustainable solutions to help clients reach their green cleaning, zero waste, and carbon neutrality goals. 
Physical
Adverse weather conditions can lead to reduced travel activity and might impact service delivery at some of our client’s 
locations that can generate increased operational costs. T o manage this risk, ABM has designed contingency plans, 
business continuity plans, crisis management procedures, and disaster recovery procedures. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT42
MANAGING OUR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINTOpportunities Related to Climate Change
Development and/or Expansion of Low Emissions Services and Products
An increase of clean energy and climate change-related regulations and incentives like rebates could generate an increase 
of demand of our sustainable services as they contribute to reduce our clients’ environmental footprint. Also, as many of 
our clients are more actively managing their climate change risks, we may see increased demand for our lower emissions 
products and services. Many more companies are responding to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and making 
commitments to the Science Based T argets. 
ABM has worked hard to be up to date on the latest sustainability trends and client industry regulations to ensure that 
the company can identify the right opportunities and generate added value through our portfolio of sustainable services. 
Through our GreenCare program, we have the greatest opportunity to help our clients reduce their environmental 
footprint with solutions like green cleaning services, energy efficiency services, on-site renewable energy generation, 
installation of EV chargers and sustainable parking solutions among others. 
Physical
Although weather conditions may lead to increase costs as described above, some weather events might create 
opportunities for increased services related to clean up and restoration; severe weather situations can also impact our 
operations in the affected areas related to our offices and our clients’ locations. This could lead to an increase of our tag 
work and therefore impact positively our sales. 
2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT43
MANAGING OUR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINTGREENING OUR FLEET
As a company that provides transportation services and operates a significant fleet, we are 
conscious of the environmental footprint that these sources of emissions generate. This is why 
we are engaged in measuring and reporting the emissions coming from our fleet of 3,400 vehicles 
comprising of light, medium and heavy trucks, minivans, passenger cars, forklifts and trailers 
among others.
We have started to make a transition to more sustainable fuels or vehicles including hybrids and 
electric vehicles. We are currently developing a roadmap and public commitment to implement a 
transition to a more sustainable fleet. So far, we have evaluated the vehicles eligible for transition 
based on available market options. As the market evolves, we expect to continue the transition with 
more of our vehicles.

MANAGING OUR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINTWHAT WE ARE DOING TO REDUCE OUR 
ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT
[302-4] REDUCTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION
At ABM we are committed to reduce the climate change impact of our operations and we are currently working on aligning 
our reduction efforts with climate science based on the COP 21 agreement that intends to keep the increase in global 
average temperature to well below 2° C or 1.5° C if possible. While we work on setting a Science Based T arget, we still have 
an ongoing commitment to reduce our metric tons of CO2e per FTE equivalent by 15% from our 2011 base year. 
It is our aim to bring consistency between our goal of supporting our clients in their transition to a low-carbon/net-zero 
economy and the way we manage our own business operations to reduce our environmental footprint. We acknowledge 
the importance of being proactive as a leader of our industry and to set up strategies to reduce our carbon footprint. 
In the short term, we plan to publicly launch our Science Based T argets commitment and we will be joining the widely 
adopted best practices to increase the electrification of our fleet. Also, we will be developing a renewable energy 
procurement strategy for the sites we can directly control and scaling to other offices our waste management pilot that 
includes proper separation of waste and composting at our main offices. 
Some of the measures we have 
implemented so far are:
• Office consolidations: some of ABM’s offices 
are being consolidated and therefore we 
have substantially reduced duplicated 
heating and cooling, use of electrical 
devices, and lighting requirements. 
• Renewable energy procurement: The 
majority of our offices in the U.K. purchase 
renewable electricity considerably 
reducing their carbon emissions. 
• Real Estate development: when opening 
new offices and upgrading current ones, 
we always seek for opening planning 
when possible to reduce the amount of 
construction and overall footprint by not 
having to provide HVAC to a multitude of 
spaces, increase the amount of daylight 
and reduce electricity demand.2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTTECHNICAL INFORMA TION ABOUT THE REPORT

Calculations were based on ABM 2019 product purchases analyzed. Compared to industry standard glug-glug packaging.  
Assumptions from Diversey product specifications, studies or industry knowledge: concentrated products in Diversey 
dispensing systems average 1:128 dilution – Comparative industry standard product assumed 1:16 dilution (this is a 
conservative number since over use of glug-glug bottles has been shown to be significant) – carbon footprint estimate 
based on packaging reductions (3.02 kg CO2eq/Kg HDPE, 2.94 Kg CO2 eq/Kg LLDPE, 1.49 Kg CO2eq/ Kg Cardboard).  
ABM’s Carbon Footprint
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) and relevant tools 
were used in these calculations. Data of natural gas use in leased offices was gathered through our annual survey. Office 
locations in which the utilities are included in common area maintenance (CAM) were estimated based upon similarity to 
other known offices of that size and region of the country. Fleet data of gallons of fuel used by vehicle and by model year 
were analyzed. Fuel purchases not directly assigned to a specific vehicle were calculated as a Light-Duty Vehicle (small 
truck/van) as that is our primary vehicle type within the ABM fleet. Actual data was gathered through our online survey 
when available. For offices that did not have readily available data or the electricity is included within CAM charges, 
estimations were made based upon similar sized offices of the same region or previous year data (if available).
Scope 1  - Data of natural gas use in leased offices was gathered through a survey. Offices in which the utilities are included 
in CAM were estimated based upon similarity to other known offices of that size and region of the country. Fleet data of 
gallons of fuel used by vehicle, by model year were analyzed. Fuel purchases not directly assigned to a specific vehicle 
were calculated as a Light-Duty Vehicle (small truck/van) as that is our primary vehicle type. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: 
A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) and relevant tools were used in these calculations.
Scope 2  - Actual electricity data was gathered through our online survey when available. For offices that did not have 
readily available data or the electricity is included within CAM charges, estimations were made based upon similar sized 
offices of the same region or previous year data (if available). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) and relevant tools were used in these calculations.
Scope 3  - T eam member Air Travel Miles, by passenger mile, by flight length <300, 300 - 1000, >1000 miles acquired 
through centralized booking. Added in 2014 was the mileage of aviation service fleet vehicles (buses, trucks, etc.) input into 
GHG Protocol Transport tool. The actual gallons used was not able to be tracked as client supplies the fuel at their own fuel 
stations. Mileage per gallon estimated via percentage of vehicle types.2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTTECHNICAL INFORMA TION ABOUT THE REPORT
