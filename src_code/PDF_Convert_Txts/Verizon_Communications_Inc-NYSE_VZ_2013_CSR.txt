PRESIDENT’S LETTER
Does technology make us more connected?
There has been a keen discussion on this point lately. Namely, whether the always-on, 
mobile, digital society that we’re all a part of brings us closer together or isolates us socially and keeps us from doing things in authentic ways. 
There is no debate in our view. We have always believed in the power of technology to 
open opportunities for creativity and commerce. In fact, we believe technology can solve almost anything precisely because it connects people and resources in new combinations that are transforming our society and providing powerful answers to the big challenges of our day. 
For instance, we instinctively believed that — with the proper support and training 
for teachers and students — infusing technology into the classroom can transform education, enabling teachers to customize the learning environment in ways that better 
prepare a student to thrive in the digital economy. 
Likewise, the U.S. spends nearly $3 trillion a year on healthcare, and this cost is growing 
more than 5 percent annually. Technology innovation can dramatically improve the productivity in this system and bring vast, immediate improvements in quality of life. Like helping underserved communities access big-city care, for instance. Or providing seniors the means to monitor their health and stay independent. Or helping disadvantaged people manage chronic diseases. 
Similarly, mobile and cloud technologies provide the tools for people and institutions to 
use energy more efficiently, creating a path to a more sustainable planet. 
In this report, you’ll read about how broadband technology is providing powerful answers to issues like these:
• Victor Zapata, a fifth-grader in Artesia, CA, can’t get enough of learning since we provided training for his teachers on 
the most effective ways to use technology in the classroom (see page 16).
• Doctors from 65 emerging countries can now consult with nearly 500 specialist physicians from leading medical centers around the world via a global telemedicine network developed through a partnership we have with the University of Virginia Telemedicine program and the U.K.-based Swinfen Charitable Trust (see page 30). 
• Families in an Austin, TX, neighborhood are learning about smart home energy use in a study we’re conducting with Pecan Street Inc., a leading energy research group (see page 33).
It’s our job to help kindle this immense potential. We’re working with leading nonprofit innovators to solve big challenges in 
education, healthcare and energy and expanding access to technology in underserved communities.
As committed as we are to using our technology for delivering both business and social value, we are equally dedicated to acting 
responsibly inside Verizon. As you will see, we are making progress there as well.
In all our efforts, we aim to demonstrate how our technology can make us more connected, accelerating social change and 
creating value for our shareowners and the communities we serve.

First-year results* show the Verizon Innovative Learning  
Schools (VILS) program, which concentrates on the infusion 
of mobile technology in the classroom coupled with teacher training, is positively affecting student interest and achievement in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math).EDUCATION
In assessment surveys, VILS students were more inclined 
than their non-VILS peers to attend college and more 
confident about wanting to major in a STEM field. They 
also reported more positive views about math and science and more frequent use of technology. 
 * Evaluations conducted by International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), “VILS 2012-13 Summary. ”A survey of VILS teachers 
conducted midway in the 2012-2013 school year showed 100 percent of the teachers reported that VILS-inspired instruction was having a positive effect on some aspect of student attitude or achievement.

Many schools are receiving technology. The problem is that teachers are not always 
equipped to harness its potential. We are doing something to close this gap. In partnership with the International Society for Technology Education, teams of math and science teachers from 24 underserved schools around the country are participating in intensive professional development to help them leverage mobile technology to improve student outcomes in STEM.
• On standardized math and science assessments, the average increase in scores for 
VILS schools was 4.63 percent, while the non-VILS comparison schools reported an average decrease of 4.18 percent.
• In assessment surveys*, VILS students were more inclined than their non-VILS peers to attend college and more confident about wanting to major in a STEM field.
• VILS students also reported more positive views about math and science and more frequent use of various technology tools. VILS teachers receive 
intensive on-site 
professional development 
and ongoing virtual training and mentorship over the course of two 
years. A survey of VILS

When 13-year-old Samantha Hinton is unsure of the ingredients in a snack,  
she just doesn’t eat it.
That’s because Samantha is among the growing population of food allergy sufferers 
in the United States, and she fears a bite containing peanuts could kill her. “I know it’s deadly, ” she told ABC News. “And the side effects are just too scary. ” 
But a team of eighth-graders at her New Hampshire school created a smartphone 
app that could make navigating the cafeteria a whole lot easier. The Hampstead Academy students took home the grand prize at Verizon’s App Challenge with their idea for “Chow Checker, ” an app that identifies food allergens.
“Chow Checker” allows users to develop a profile and select up to 12 allergens. If 
they scan a food item or search for it in the app, and it contains something to which they’re allergic, the app will let them know. The app uses food ingredient data from The Hampstead Academy

The pediatric units of Children’s Health Fund — the famous big blue buses —  
are now “mobile” in more ways than one. 
By equipping Children’s Health Fund buses in several key cities with 4G L TE 
wireless technology and enabling health IT solutions, Verizon is making it possible for the group’s medical staff to provide more immediate care to patients.
Administrative tasks that typically take hours or days can be accomplished 
immediately using this technology, which can have significant benefits. 
For instance, the medical staff in these locations now has real-time connections 
to immunization records that are required by schools but often hard for parents to produce, especially if they are living in a shelter. The technology also supports telehealth services like access to specialty physicians, as well as texting programs that focus on education and disease management.
This initiative is under way in Miami, New Y ork City, San Francisco, Phoenix, Detroit 
and Dallas. Children’s Health Fund estimates that efficiencies created by the program will save nearly 4,000 hours of administrative work each year at these locations combined, freeing up significantly more time for patient care.

and her colleagues reach more people by upgrading the group’s electronic health records system.
“It has been invaluable to have this level of connectivity, to be able to see a patient’s 
full record, ” said Quinones. “Sometimes we encounter patients for the first time, but they’re actually not new to the system. Now we don’t have to build a record from scratch. The effort involved in piecing one together is time-consuming, costly and requires a lot of phone calls back and forth to the main office. ”“We had recently lost touch

Domestic violence is a pervasive social problem and, research now shows, has 
disturbing implications for women’s health. 
A survey commissioned by Verizon and MORE magazine found that 70 percent of 
adult American women over the age of 21 have a chronic health condition. That number rises to 81 percent among women who have experienced any form of domestic violence. 
This is especially serious given that 44 percent of the approximately 1,000 women 
surveyed said they experienced a form of domestic violence, including physical, emotional, sexual or economic abuse. 
Despite the high correlation between chronic health conditions and experiencing 
domestic violence, only 6 percent of women surveyed believe their doctor or nurse has ever made a connection between the two. Three-fourths of women say they have never been asked about domestic violence during a medical exam. Among women aged 45 and older, 85 percent have never been screened.

while also identifying solutions for the future. 
• In November 2012, we held a briefing on Capitol Hill in conjunction with the 
Congressional Caucus for Women’s Issues to announce the implications of the research and address solutions.
• An outreach effort we’re funding via the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Jersey is arming doctors and nurses with strong domestic violence

• We’ve joined a nationwide network of experts from a range of disciplines to identify how technology can boost domestic violence intervention and improve chronic health conditions.
STOPPING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
Since 2000, Verizon has provided more than $52 million in grants to domestic violence prevention organizations and shelters. We invest in groups that provide domestic violence prevention education, care for victims and resources that empower victims. 
We have also supported initiatives that encourage adult men to serve as role models 
to young men, as well as programs that teach teens about healthy relationships and preventing dating violence.
We also leverage our wireless operations in this effort via HopeLine, a program 
that turns no-longer-used cell phones into critical lifelines of support for domestic violence victims and survivors. Since 2011, we have distributed more than 86,900 HopeLine phones with wireless service for use by victims, survivors and organizations.

2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTSHARED SUCCESS PRIORITIES | HEALTHCAREEMPOWERING WOMEN TO MANAGE THEIR CARE
Women are frequently diagnosed with chronic diseases later than men and 
experience higher fatality rates, due in part to a lack of access to regular care. 
That’s why we support partnerships that highlight the role technology can play in 
increasing access to care and aiding in chronic disease management for  
underserved women. We are partnering with academic health centers at Johns Hopkins and Emory Universities to address both of these challenges. 
Clinicians and patients are working together remotely via mobile technology with the 
goal of increasing adherence to care plans and self-management of chronic conditions. 
EXTENDING INDEPENDENT LIVING FOR SENIORS
We’re launching a new program in 2014 that will use remote monitoring devices and telemedicine solutions to help underserved seniors with diabetes or heart and lung disease to age in place longer. 
One of the first to partner with us on this health technology program is the South 
Boston Community Health Center in Massachusetts.
Using tablets, cell phones and medical devices wirelessly connected to the health 
center, seniors will be able to perform a number of health monitoring functions themselves at home. The data from these activities will be transmitted automatically to the center’s healthcare professionals, who will also use videoconferencing to provide even further engagement with the patients.
The program will begin with 60 seniors at the South Boston Center who are  
suffering with diabetes or heart and lung disease. Once the program is implemented, those seniors with diabetes will no longer need 
to visit the center to have their glucose level checked. They’ll use a glucometer and adapter at home. Obese patients will not need to visit the center to weigh in; they’ll have an auditory scale at home. Patients with respiratory disorders will be able to test their respiratory function with a pulse oximeter. Patients do not even need to push a button to transmit the data.
The technology will make it easier for seniors who have had to get a ride to their 
appointments, or take public transportation, to obtain medical care. The  
technology does not eliminate the need for checkups, but it means fewer appointments are needed. Seniors with diabetes will  
no longer need to visit the 
South Boston Community 
Health Center to have their glucose level checked.

From child’s play to  
GAME CHANGER
We are funding the expansion of a first-of-its-kind treatment-monitoring system  
that uses our mobile technology to improve care for tuberculosis patients. 
The system is called Video Directly Observed Therapy, or VDOT, and is the brainchild 
of Dr. Richard Garfein and his team at the Department of Medicine at the University of California-San Diego. 
VDOT uses our cloud service and smartphones to enable TB patients to video 
themselves taking their daily medications and send the videos to health departments where staff can remotely monitor and document each dose  
of medication.
We believe powering VDOT with our mobile technology will improve the likelihood that patients will regularly take their medications — a critical component of successful treatment. The system also provides a degree of monitoring that is much less intrusive than an in-home visit.
The system stands to be far more cost effective than traditional, in-person 
monitoring procedures. Analysis by UC San Diego researcher Dr. Jose Burgos showed the program can save health departments $2,800 per patient each year —  
a 66 percent reduction in costs.
The San Diego County TB Control Program is already using VDOT, and health 
departments in San Francisco and New Y ork City will soon begin using the  
new system.

Technology is changing our approach to creating a sustainable society. Some changes are 
obvious, such as digital media replacing books and video conferencing reducing the need for business travel. But the real transformation is just emerging as mobile and Internet technologies — like cloud storage, machine-to-machine telematics, and wireless — are 
incorporated into the energy grid. 
The changeover stands to be revolutionary, as our energy grids are converted from a 
one-way system into a dynamic information processing ecosystem with the potential to double the nation’s energy efficiency over the next 30 years.
OUR FOCUS 
• Use technology-enabled solutions to 
empower underserved populations to better manage their energy consumption and save money. 
• Build awareness of how to promote smarter energy consumption. 
 * Source: 2010 Census data, April 2013SOCIAL ISSUES WE’RE ADDRESSING

We can influence how business is conducted in our evolving global economy.
To ensure this level of integrity and responsible behavior, all employees are required 
to adhere to the Verizon Code of Conduct. It provides guidelines on such matters as gifts and entertainment, Internet practices, conflicts of interest and confidentiality — with an emphasis on protecting the information that our customers, business partners and fellow employees have entrusted to our care.
Relationships with our suppliers are based on the highest standards of ethical 
conduct, and our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the company’s expectations of our vendors to conduct business with integrity and respect.
We administer the Conflict of Interest Questionnaire (COIQ) to our leadership 
team and our Supply Chain Services organization. The questionnaire addresses all identified actual or potential business conflicts and is completed by 100 percent of our leadership team to ensure we conduct business with integrity.
Our Human Rights Statement articulates our respect for the broad principles in 
the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, many of which can be applied to 
how global businesses can build good relationships around the world and work 
successfully among different customs and cultures. 
In June 2013, minor adjustments were made to various related Verizon documents 
to ensure consistency and alignment, foster greater employee understanding and strengthen our Human Rights Statement. 
Our commitment to promote human rights values is consistent with our dedication 
to respect employees, value customers, strengthen communities, protect the environment and engage with stakeholders to make the right decisions for the future of our business.It is imperative 
that we conduct business responsibly and ethically wherever 
 
we operate.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP41
2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We listen to and talk with a wide range of people — consumers, seniors, educators, 
elected officials, law enforcement, minorities, rural constituents, veterans and others — who are important to our business. 
Our long-standing Consumer Advisory Board, which consists of leading public interest 
advocates from across the country, meets two to three times a year and delivers an unfiltered view of business and social issues. Their opinions and advice play an important role in the development and eventual sale of many of our products and services.
We generate multiple discussions through our website and the use of social media. 
We further expanded our participation in social media channels to include Twitter.
As part of our stakeholder outreach, we use our Consumer Roundtable to educate 
consumers on our strategies and to solicit their recommendations. All of these forums provide us with valuable intelligence that helps us improve the effectiveness of the solutions we offer our customers and measure the environmental performance of our business.
We’re also mindful that, because of our scope and scale, our voice can be helpful on a 
range of social issues that are important to our stakeholders. For instance, Verizon has publicly advocated this year on immigration reform legislation, the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, phone reform in prison and gay marriage. 
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS 
We advocate public policies that benefit our customers and our employees, and enable us to compete fairly and freely in the marketplace. We post all our political contributions for public view.
Verizon is affected by a wide variety of government policies — from 
telecommunications regulation to taxation to healthcare and more — that affect the business climate in which we operate. 
Political contributions are one way we support the democratic electoral process and 
participate in the policy dialogue. Our employees have established political action committees (PACs) at the federal level and in 19 states. These PACs allow employees to pool their resources to support candidates for office who generally support the public policies our employees advocate.
The contribution process is overseen by the Corporate Governance and Policy 
Committee of our Board of Directors, which receives a comprehensive report and briefing on these activities annually. In addition, Verizon posts a report of our political contributions twice a year on our public website. This transparency about our political spending is in keeping with our commitment to good corporate governance and a further sign of our responsiveness to the interests of our shareowners.

2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTPRIVACY
Verizon requires all employees, partners and suppliers to protect the privacy of 
information about our customers. 
Our Privacy Approach  
• Privacy is an essential element in the processes we use to create innovative products and services. 
• We recognize that individual customers have different privacy preferences and make different choices about uses of information with which they are comfortable. 
• We are transparent in describing to our customers how their information is used, and we give customers the opportunity to choose whether certain information uses and sharing are acceptable to them. 
• We understand that consumers will use the full capabilities of our communications networks and the vast opportunities our products  
and services provide, only if they trust that their information will  
remain private. 
• Protecting the privacy of customer information is part of each Verizon employee’s responsibility, and we have safeguards in place to shield customer information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
As Verizon develops new products and services, deploys new technologies and develops new uses of information, we review and update our privacy policy to reflect these changes. We also strive to present our practices in a way that makes our policy easy to read.
In accordance with our privacy policy, Verizon provides notice about new information 
collection and use practices and explains to customers their choices about these uses. 
In addition, in January 2014 we launched an online Transparency Report that 
provides data on the number of law enforcement requests for consumer information that Verizon received in 2013 in the U.S. and other countries where we do business. 
Protecting our customers’ privacy is a commitment at Verizon. While we have a 
legal obligation to provide customer information to law enforcement in response to lawful demands, we take seriously our duty to provide such information only when authorized by law. Our dedicated teams carefully review each demand and reject those that fail to comply with the law. If a demand is overly broad or vague, we will not disclose any information in response or will work to narrow the scope of the information we produce. Some demands seek information that we simply do not have; accordingly, we produce no information at all or only some of the information sought by those demands from law enforcement. Protecting our 
customers’ privacy is a bedrock commitment .CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP43

2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTDISTRACTED DRIVING
Responsible driving is everyone’s responsibility. We want people to arrive at their 
destinations safely.
In 2000, Verizon became the first wireless carrier to support state legislation 
banning hand-held cell phone use while driving. We're still engaged in responsible driving initiatives today, advocating for common-sense legislation and spearheading consumer education efforts to raise awareness about driving responsibly. 
We are also leading community programs to educate drivers and encourage 
responsible driving. For example, the company partnered with Seattle Public High Schools in a campaign (“Save It Seattle: Pledge to Stop Texting and Driving”) enlisting students to pledge to stop texting while driving. 
Verizon Telematics offers its “In Drive” service which allows a user to disable or limit 
some functions on a mobile device when a vehicle is in motion.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY
BRINGING L TE TO RURAL AMERICA
In 2010, Verizon created the L TE in Rural America (LRA) program, a collaborative partnership with rural carriers to accelerate the deployment of rural wireless broadband services. 
Under LRA, participants lease valuable 700 MHz radio spectrum from Verizon and 
build their own networks, enabling them to offer 4G L TE services more quickly and more economically than might otherwise be possible. A dedicated team of Verizon technology experts works directly with the rural carriers as they develop and deploy their networks.
The program is successful and growing. As of 2014, there are 20 participants, including existing CDMA carriers and rural 
telephone companies. Seventeen rural mobile carriers have launched their 4G L TE 47

2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTPROCESSES: FOCUSING ON ENERGY REDUCTION 
It takes a lot of energy to power our wireline and wireless communications networks 
around the globe — more than 10 billion kWh of electricity annually. In fact, with over 46,000 cell sites, 120 million square feet of real estate and 200 data centers, carbon emissions associated with our energy use represent our principal environmental impact. That’s why for more than a decade, we have focused on improving our overall energy efficiency to reduce both our costs and our environmental footprint. 
The electricity to run our networks represents our largest energy category, accounting 
for more than 92 percent of our carbon emissions in 2013. The carbon associated with the energy to fuel our fleet represents the second-largest category at approximately 6 percent in 2013. The fuel to heat our buildings and run our backup generators accounted for approximately 2 percent of our emissions in 2013.
Green Energy Initiatives
We have long been focused on network energy efficiency. In 2009, we set energy efficiency standards for network equipment that continue to enable our suppliers  
to deliver equipment that is consistently more energy efficient than the equipment  
it replaces. 
In 2013, we announced an investment of more than $100 million in a solar and fuel 
cell energy project that will help power Verizon facilities across the country. By year-end, we implemented 12.4MW of solar and fuel cells, with another 2.6MW near completion, surpassing our goal to implement 10MW . In total, the systems are expected to produce more than 89 million kWh of electricity in year one to power our critical data centers, central offices, and office buildings across six states. This effort will also eliminate more than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide — enough to offset the annual CO
2 emissions from more than 1 million gallons of gas. 
Additionally, Verizon expanded our partnership with the National Renewable Energy For more than 
a decade, we have focused on improving our overall energy efficiency.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | SUSTAINABILITY & THE ENVIRONMENT50
2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTLaboratory to test whether combinations of solar, wind, battery and generator 
systems can be efficiently deployed at remote cell sites.
Six cell sites were identified for review, bringing our total to 12 (six were selected in 2012). All of the sites are far away from the utility power grid and currently use propane generators as the source of power. Initial findings are impressive, promising significant savings in fuel, operating costs and CO
2 emissions. At one location a hybrid power 
system configuration could power the cell site with up to 89 percent renewable energy.
Building Operations
In our building operations, pursuit of ENERGY STAR and LEED certification has helped us to significantly reduce energy usage. As of year-end 2013, Verizon had 141 certified ENERGY STAR retail stores and 172 LEED certified retail stores.
We are also incorporating green strategies into our data center operations. In 
2013, the savings in six of our domestic data centers totaled 10.8 million kWh and 21.6 million gallons of water. The electricity savings were achieved by installing solar panels, improving air handling and fan operations, upgrading chiller units and installing lighting controls and LED lighting. The water savings were achieved through various water treatment and condenser upgrades.
Our Network Operations group completed “smart building technology” projects at 
35 central offices in 2013 (34 domestic and one international) using Vigilent energy management systems. The projects accounted for 35 million kWh of annualized energy savings. 
In 2013, we modified our generators at more than 26,000 cell sites to be ready 
to start when needed at a lower temperature, reducing the amount of electricity required and reducing CO
2 emissions by more than 42 thousand metric tons. The 
installation of HVAC economizers on select cell sites increased the use of outside air to cool the buildings, which reduced CO
2 emissions by approximately 8.9 million 
metric tons.
Making Our Buildings Greener
• Since Verizon started certifying retail stores in the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program in 2009, 172 of our stores have earned LEED certification.
• LEED Certification indicates a building was designed, constructed, and is operated to ensure energy savings, emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental quality and effective stewardship of resources.
• Verizon was also named as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Y ear in 2013  
— the first and only wireless company to win this award.“Verizon is a source 
of inspiration for 
other retailers 
who are looking to 
improve building 
performance, 
reduce cost, 
improve comfort, 
and optimize 
operations. ”

We believe that independent assurance enhances credibility and therefore 
contributes to building trust with our stakeholders. 
We engaged Ernst & Y oung to perform an independent review of our 2013 
greenhouse gas emissions reporting (Scope 1, 2 and business travel). Ernst & Y oung completed a limited assurance engagement, in accordance with industry standards, and nothing came to their attention that would lead them to believe that our data presentation is not accurate or complete, in all material respects.  
Read Ernst & Y oung’s assurance report.
Fleet Operations 
Verizon has implemented our Networkfleet telematics product in approximately 18,000 company vehicles. Networkfleet allows us to optimize fuel consumption, monitor for mechanical issues, and provide customized, just-in-time maintenance. Improved fleet performance not only reduces costly mechanical issues, but it also decreases fuel consumption and associated carbon emissions. Monitoring also allows us to configure the fleet so that the right number of vehicles are in the right place at the right time, reducing idling and therefore, emissions. Additionally, in 2013, we replaced approximately 1,000 full-size service vehicles with smaller mini-vans that achieve greater fuel economy than the vehicles they replaced.

We also understand that our products represent a significant component of our 
environmental footprint. While we do not manufacture the devices we sell, we work with our suppliers to encourage greener designs and to offer responsible reuse and recycling options for customers when they look to switch out devices. 
Device Recycling 
Our device recycling program allows retail customers to trade-in phones, tablets and 
other wireless devices — regardless of carrier, or when or where they were purchased — at our stores or online for a Verizon gift card that they can use toward a purchase or to pay their bill. Business customers can recycle their devices for an account credit by contacting their Verizon business sales representative. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | SUSTAINABILITY & THE ENVIRONMENT

Changes in Verizon-Branded Accessory Packaging 
We have placed a significant focus on reducing the packaging associated with 
cell phone accessories — chargers, batteries, ear phones, etc. In 2013, Verizon switched our packaging for Verizon-branded accessories to materials sourced from post-consumer waste sources.
Network Equipment Recycling
Our internal recycling programs focus on the proper disposition of old network equipment, lead acid batteries and office paper and cardboard, all to reduce the landfilling of material and to turn our waste into raw materials for other processes. 
Curbing eWaste 
Our goal is to recycle 2 million pounds of e-waste by 2015 via our public Recycling Rallies, which expand the impact of our recycling beyond our operations into communities. Since 2010, nearly 1.5 million pounds of e-waste have been collected.54

ENGAGING OUR SUPPLIERS
Our commitment to sustainability extends throughout our supply chain. 
Since 2011, we have conducted an annual Supplier Sustainability Assessment to 
evaluate our suppliers’ sustainability strategy, greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions, 
solid waste management, water use and management, packaging practices, and sustainability in subcontracting.
We established a goal that, by the end of 2015, 40 percent of our supplier spending 
would be with firms that measure and set public targets to reduce CO
2 emissions.

AND THE COMMUNITY
• Verizon held 43 recycling events across the country in 2013, encouraging employees and their neighbors to bring in no-longer-used electronics gear, phones, and supplies. More than 360,000 pounds of material (equivalent to 522 metric tons of CO
2 offset) was collected from more than 4,800 participants. Approximately 
1,000 phones were collected for HopeLine and more than 200 boxes of supplies were donated to local charities.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | SUSTAINABILITY & THE ENVIRONMENT56
2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENT• Almost 13,500 employees representing 26 countries are now members of the 
Verizon Green Team. Team members implemented numerous energy efficiency programs at their work locations, including leading community recycling events at 18 locations across the U.S. on America Recycles Day. 
• Employee team-building exercises now have a green angle. Several of our employee groups have taken up “Go Green Racing” , a team-building project that involves building and racing a solar-powered car from a kit. The cars that have been built to date — along with new car kits — have been donated to local schools to incorporate into their science curriculum. Those schools are Patrick Healy Middle School in East Orange, NJ; the Bronx Academy of Promise in New Y ork; and Long Branch Middle School in Long Branch, NJ.
• Verizon was the first Super Bowl sponsor focused on sustainability. As part of our commitment, we worked with the Super Bowl XL VIII Host Committee and the NFL to plant more than 27,000 trees and shrubs across all New Y ork City boroughs and nine counties in New Jersey. We also hosted two Super Bowl e-waste recycling rallies collecting more than 8,000 pounds of equipment.
Environmental Notices
In 2013, Verizon received 74 notices regarding compliance issues with state and local environmental regulations. Most were for recordkeeping or other minor issues and did not affect the environment. All notices have been or are in the process of being resolved.
Shop with the Environment in Mind
We’re committed to responsible business practices including identifying key environmental information for our devices.
Our ECO Specs label went into effect last year on a selection of our cell phones. 
Customers can spot key environmental information at a glance — energy 
efficiency, percentage of recycled content in the Verizon-branded accessory packaging, percentage of recycled content in the device, compliance with our standards on hazardous toxins in the plastics and batteries, and compliance on  
our standards for the recyclability of the device and its components.
Our ECO Specs label will eventually be included on all cell phones, tablets  
and accessories.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | SUSTAINABILITY & THE ENVIRONMENT

GHG EMISSIONS REPORTING STANDARDS
SOURCES OF EMISSIONS FACTORS
DATA COLLECTION AND ESTIMATIONSThe purpose of this section is to provide 
additional information regarding our carbon emissions accounting methodology. Verizon uses generally accepted accounting standards for tracking and reporting our greenhouse gas inventory. We report our emissions based on a calendar year for all sources of emissions.
We define our Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions reporting in accordance with  
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.• Scope 1 – all direct sources of emissions owned or controlled by Verizon, with the main categories being fuel to power our fleet,  to heat our buildings and to power our backup generators
• Scope 2 – indirect emissions sources generated off-site, but purchased by Verizon. The main category is electricity to power our networks and data centers, plus a small amount of steam and heat purchased to heat our buildings.
In addition we reference the following standards:• U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2008 Climate Leaders Greenhouse Gas Reporting Protocol: Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources, Direct Emissions from Mobile Combustion Sources and Indirect Emissions from Purchases/Sales of Electricity and Steam
• The Climate Registry 2008 General Reporting Protocol Version 1.1: Section 13.2 Calculating CH4 and N2O Emissions from Mobile Combustion
For Scope 3 emissions we utilize The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.• Scope 3 – Verizon reports employee business travel by air and rail

2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALSSUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT
We take pride in our strong relationships with suppliers, and strive to promote a 
mutually beneficial business relationship based on the highest standards of ethical conduct as codified in our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
In May 2013, we enhanced the Code to clarify our expectations. The code now 
contains provisions that:
• Explicitly prohibit the use of child labor, forced labor and discrimination
• Explicitly protect the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, 
pursuant to local laws
• Advise suppliers that they are expected to ensure that products supplied to Verizon do not contain “conflict minerals”
• Outline our intent to constructively engage with suppliers on compliance and enforcement (see Supplier Review Process below)
SUPPLIER REVIEW PROCESS
Verizon is committed to collaborating with our supply chain partners to meet the high ethical, environmental, social, human rights, labor and safety standards that are embodied in our Supplier Code of Conduct and applicable laws. 
To meet the challenges involved in assessing our suppliers’ corporate responsibility 
(CR) compliance, Verizon engaged EcoVadis to help evaluate key suppliers’ performance, focusing on environment, labor and human rights, fair labor practices and sustainable procurement. 
Verizon is in the process of assessing 200 of our key suppliers. While supplier 
questionnaires drive the first phase of the assessment, the EcoVadis approach entails active validation of responses, collection of supplier information from public sources including NGOs, media and other sources and benchmarking suppliers on various CR factors. When weaknesses are identified, Verizon is able to collaborate with the supplier on corrective action plans promoting communication and improvement, thereby mitigating risk for both Verizon and the supplier.
For selected members of our supply chain that are closest to our core businesses, 
on-site, CR-focused audits are an important element of supply chain engagement. In 2013, Verizon joined the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) as its first U.S.-based member. JAC is an association of telecom operators focusing on CR issues in the supply chain. To promote efficiency and best practices, JAC provides a shared and coordinated on-site CR audit program of suppliers common to JAC members. SUPPL Y CHAIN
59
2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTCurrently, there are 10 JAC members: Deutsche Telecom, Orange, Telecom Italia, Belgacom, 
KPN, Swisscom, Telenor, TeliaSonera, Vodafone and Verizon. As a member of JAC, Verizon will serve on the Leadership Assembly and the Operational Board. In coordination with JAC, Verizon will directly fund and manage a number of CR audits in 2014.
CONFLICT MINERALS
In accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, Verizon is committed to ensuring that our products are responsibly manufactured by suppliers. 
Suppliers are expected to ensure that products supplied to Verizon do not contain 
metals derived from tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, or their derivatives that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (or any adjoining country). 
Our complete Statement on Conflict Minerals is available online. 
SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
Verizon has a long-standing commitment to supplier diversity with goals, initiatives 
and incentives designed to drive broad inclusion in our supply chain for certified minority, women and service-disabled veteran business enterprises. 
In 2013, Verizon purchased $6.3 billion in goods and services with diverse suppliers, 
an increase of more than $1 billion compared with 2012, bringing our total spending to more than $22 billion over the past five years.

2013 Recognition for Supplier Diversity
In 2013, Verizon again received recognition from several important organizations regarding our support for supplier diversity:
• The Women’s Business Enterprise National Council named Verizon a  
“Top Corporation” in support of women-owned businesses for the eighth 
consecutive year
• Minority Business News named Verizon to its Corporate 101 list for our efforts  
in support of diverse enterprises
• Verizon was once again placed on Diversity Inc. ’s “Top 50 Companies  
for Diversity” list. 
Verizon is a charter member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, a coalition of 18 companies that spend more than $1 billion each year with diverse suppliers, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Million Dollar Club for integrating Hispanic businesses into our sourcing and procurement process.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | SUPPL Y CHAIN61

EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT
Verizon is committed to providing employees with the learning and development they need to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and deliver a great experience to our customers every day. 
That commitment to employee learning and development has placed Verizon among 
the best corporations globally, as demonstrated by our No. 1 ranking from Training magazine for the second year in a row. We have ranked among the magazine’s Training Top 125 for 12 consecutive years and were recently inducted into its Hall of Fame, as a result of our ranking in the top 10 for four consecutive years.
We leverage our own technology — mobile devices and cloud-based computing 
powered by our network — to bring learning and development content to our employees when they need it most to better support our customers. Our ability to put customers first every day is dependent on engaged and talented employees, so Verizon invests heavily in our people and our learning and development systems. 
Last year we invested more than $275 million in learning and development, offering 
more than 12,000 courses. In total, Verizon employees completed more than 8 million hours of training in 2013 — equivalent to an average of 45.2 hours per employee. In the last three years, Verizon employees have completed more than 24 million hours of training.

Health & Wellness
Verizon is committed to the health and wellness of our employees, their families and 
our retirees. In 2013, we provided coverage to more than 700,000 beneficiaries, investing more than $3.2 billion to deliver high-quality health care benefits. 
Our goal is to provide a work environment that promotes a culture of health.  
We promote health and wellness across our population through a personalized 
experience with particular attention to these pillars.
• Health Literacy — increase the participant’s ability to access, understand and apply 
basic health information and services to make good decisions and take action.
• Accountability — drive participants to take sustainable steps to get and stay 
healthy and efficiently use benefits and resources to help manage health care costs.
• Environment — adopt healthy workplace best practices to promote smart eating choices, increase physical activity options, enforce tobacco-free policies and share stress management resources.
• Health on Demand — provide personalized, innovative health tools and media that are conveniently accessed on demand and encourage participants to use them.
• Social Support Community — foster a framework that will help identify internal Verizon communities to support and reinforce healthy habits.
• Bridging the Gap — share the information, resources and successes of a healthy work 
culture with employees’ families and within the communities we serve where feasible.
We achieve these pillars through a robust program that combines quality health care 
benefits, extensive health-literacy resources and tools and preventive and early detection services delivered through our health plans and readily accessible lifestyle programs.
What fuels our positive health and wellness results are our “Be Well, Work Well” 
programs. At the grass-roots level, we offer on-site health and wellness initiatives at more than 150 locations, including 45 on-site Health and Wellness Centers. Our on-site events included biometric health screenings, mammography screenings

2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTPreventive care and outreach initiatives at Verizon also include prenatal and 
postnatal maternity care with our Healthy Pregnancy Program (formerly known as Future Moms) at Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. The Health Pregnancy Program accounted for 30 percent of all Verizon employees’ babies delivered in 2013, a  
3 percent increase in participation over 2012.
Ensuring employees have access to the right care at the right time is one of our 
health benefits priorities. An example is the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Radiology Program, launched in mid-2013. Anthem’s nurses, in partnership with the participant’s physician, review imaging referrals to recommend the most appropriate tests with the least exposure to excessive radiation. 
We use technology to connect with and educate employees through our WellConnect 
portal, targeted email campaigns and webinars. WellConnect is the gateway to all Verizon health and wellness resources, where employees access information on resources for preventive care, tobacco cessation, exercise, healthy recipes and more. Visits to WellConnect increased by 98 percent in 2013, with the help of the new Wellness Now interactive eMagazine. 
Online webinars also deliver information on key health topics and present an 
opportunity to ask questions of clinicians and subject matter experts. Webinar topics for 2013 included Healthy Pregnancy, Men’s Health, Know Y our Numbers — Preventive Care Screenings, and Asthma Awareness. On average, 1,000 employees participated in each webinar. 
Among the targeted email campaigns for 2013, we promoted breast cancer 
awareness and the importance of screenings for women, delivering messages with culturally relevant information about breast cancer based on race/ethnicity demographics. Messages also were deployed to men who were encouraged to share this health information with the important women in their lives.
In 2014, Verizon will continue our comprehensive commitment to providing our 
employees with the information, resources and tools they need to be well and work well. We believe that a healthy and productive workforce is at the heart of a healthy and successful business. 
Work/Life Balance
Sometimes employees face personal challenges with issues related to health and wellness or caring for children or adults that could affect their ability to work. That’s why we offer alternative work arrangements. Also, our comprehensive Employee Assistance Program is a valuable resource that can connect employees with professional assistance, spanning child services, elder care services, adoption assistance, in-care social support and many other family services.
For new parents, our “Gradual Return to Work Program” allows most employees 
returning from childbirth or child-adoption leaves to maintain their benefits coverage while working a reduced schedule. Also, for most employees who choose to adopt, Verizon will reimburse them up to $10,000 for each adopted child for 
Having a healthy baby is every mom’s goal. You want to 
make the right choices and take care of yourself so 
you can reach that goal. But it’s not always easy to do 
it alone. 
That’s why there’s the Healthy Pregnancy program. It’s a 
program that can help you make good choices. And that 
can help you have a safe delivery and a healthy child.

Support for Veterans
Veterans and active service men and women bring unique skills to their work as Verizon employees, lending their focus, perseverance and leadership to the job of serving our customers and advancing our business. During the past decade, more than 2,000 employees have been called up to active duty, and Verizon has been there to provide benefits and protect their employment.
To support and retain these valuable employees, Verizon pays the difference between 
an employee’s military pay and their Verizon pay for up to three years, with no interruption of health benefits for their dependents. In addition, we offer programs to assist employees with finding work at Verizon locations that are close to a spouse on active duty.
Verizon continues to partner with other various agencies such as the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce, Department of Defense, Joining Forces, Employer Support of the Guard & Reserves and Military Spouse Employer Partnerships. We also partner with other large companies in efforts such as the "100,000 Jobs Mission," which aims to collectively hire 100,000 transitioning military men and women and other veterans by the end of 2020.

Hiring Our Heroes?  
THERE’S AN APP FOR THAT
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce asked if the multiple assets on its “Hiring Our  
Heroes” website could go mobile and be easily accessible to military veterans and 
their spouses. Our answer: Of course.
We assembled a team of Verizon employees who collaborated with frog Design — an 
award-winning design and technology company — and James Cunningham, a veteran 
and former manager of digital properties for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to create the first app built in-house for the public.
“We understand first-hand the invaluable 
experience, skills and most of all leadership 
that veterans bring to the workplace. 
Through the Hiring Our Heroes mobile 
app, we’re using the awesome power of our

ERGs support achievement of key business goals through initiatives focused 
on employee engagement and retention, diversity awareness and recruitment, understanding our broad customer base and philanthropic efforts aimed at sharing our success with our communities. They also provide a stronger sense of community within the company.
ERGs align their efforts with business goals and provide a wealth of knowledge that 
can be leveraged to drive results. The cross-functional nature of ERG membership fosters collaboration, information sharing and connections to our diverse customer and vendor base.

Through our employee communications, we create an ongoing conversation that allows for collaboration, participation and innovation at all levels across our global business and supports our Verizon culture, which fosters an employee experience rooted in the open, candid and direct exchange of ideas.
A central communications channel is VZWeb, which delivers a rich, social and 
personalized intranet experience. VZWeb connects employees with company and industry news, policies and resources and collaboration tools. Thousands of employees post comments and replies on the news, submit their ideas and carry on a discussion with colleagues across the globe. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | ENGAGING EMPLOYEES

2013 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTVZWeb Content
VZWeb serves as the portal to other company content including: 
• “About Y ou, ” our human resources website that provides a robust, 
personalized experience for employees to explore career and training opportunities, manage their wealth accumulation, balance work and family life, access personalized benefits information, learn how to improve their health and wellness, use performance management tools and review HR 
guidelines, safety and policy information.
• “The Learning Portal, ” where employees can develop their skills, expand 
their knowledge, complete training requirements and enhance their leadership capabilities through online access from work and from home to 
Skillsoft, Books 24x7, Verizon Leadership University, podcasts and much 
more. The site maintains a record of all training completed and allows employees to rate and share comments on courses.
• Our Credo, Commitment & Values, Code of Conduct, Corporate Responsibility News, Diversity Strategy, Ethics and Compliance, Green and Sustainability, Verizon Recognition and Awards, the Verizon Foundation, and the Verizon Employee Relief Fund (V2V).
• Videos and webcasts that provide updates on new products and business initiatives, plus stories about employees serving customers, innovating powerful solutions through our unmatched technology platforms and volunteering in our communities around the world. 
Internal and external social networking tools promote knowledge and ideas sharing, cross-collaboration among teams and exchanges on business initiatives. Employees connect with one another through Y ammer and Chatter, and with senior management through live-chat technology, where they can ask questions and receive real-time answers directly from leadership. In 2013, Verizon leaders conducted multiple hour-long chats on topics including process improvement, sales, customer experience and information technology.
Employees also can speak directly with Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam during 
his all-employee webcasts. During these webcasts, Lowell reviews progress on key objectives, financial results and shareholder value creation, and answers questions from the live audience and employees around the world, who submit questions through VZWeb or via text messaging. He also presents Verizon Credo awards to publicly recognize high-achieving employees who put our Credo into action every day. 
Because the volume of questions exceeds what can be covered during the live 
webcast, Lowell frequently posts additional responses to key issues on VZWeb. Senior leaders across Verizon also regularly host webcasts, conducting 80 in 2013. In addition, across the globe, local and senior leaders host smaller, more informal town hall meetings and roundtables. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | ENGAGING EMPLOYEES70

amplifying the voice of the employee — and in turn, provides the V Team with the critical tools they need to deliver superior customer experiences and create value for our shareholders.
Voice of the Employee
We amplify the Voice of the Employee within our business by inviting employees to share their opinions about the company through the Verizon Viewpoints employee opinion survey. Conducted once every two years, the survey allows employees to provide their perceptions about key areas of our business, such as Our Credo, Culture & Core Values, Customer Focus, Quality & Value Creation, Employee Experience and what it’s like to work at Verizon. 
Employees also are invited to write in comments about any business-related topic. 
In 2012, nearly 94,000 employees responded, and we received more than 40,000 write-in comments.
Our 2012 survey showed that we surpassed industry benchmarks for measures on 
culture/values, pay and benefits, corporate citizenship, overall satisfaction and engagement. Also, of the 18 questions repeated from the 2010 survey, 83 percent improved in favorability. Each Verizon business unit has received its Viewpoints results and will continue the dialogue with its teams on those opportunities identified where we can improve our performance. In 2014, we will again survey our employees across the globe (see page 79 for Key Performance Indicators).
In addition to our biennial employee survey, several “Pulse” surveys are conducted 
each year that are designed to provide an ongoing measure of the internal health and climate of the organization. We conduct a Performance Pulse Survey each year to ensure that supervisors are providing annual performance reviews and discussions with their teams along with clear performance objectives.

LABOR RELATIONS
We have a long history of working with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) — the two main unions that represent approximately 50,000 Verizon employees. These employees are covered by 50 collective-bargaining agreements.
In 2013, we completed 13 contract negotiations (primarily in the West areas) that 
covered approximately 6,800 employees. These agreements continue our history of providing good jobs with competitive wages, valuable benefits and affordable quality healthcare that rate among the best in our industry. 
In addition to contract negotiations, Verizon continued to conduct meetings with 
union leadership to discuss matters key to the business and employees, such as safety, the state of the business, efforts to improve business processes and absence. At the local bargaining unit level, periodic meetings were held to discuss issues such as workforce adjustments, impacts of technological change, safety, workplace consolidations and transfer of employees.
SAFETY 
Verizon is among the leaders in safety, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In 2013, our Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Rate for U.S. operations was 1.35 per 100 employees, almost one-third better than the BLS telecommunications-industry average of 2.00. 
We make safety a top priority and take extensive actions to ensure that all 
employees enjoy a safe and productive work environment. Our safety performance is a direct result of our comprehensive safety management processes. Key elements of our approach to safety include: 
• Internal and third-party domestic and international audits to ensure compliance 
with our environmental compliance and safety-management processes.
• A wide array of training along with tools and safety equipment based on job requirements.
• Providing information and standard operating procedures that employees need to work safely in field operations, call centers, stores or administrative offices.

Carmen Flores loves it when she sees “the light  
bulb go on” with students. 
During the past several years, she has devoted hundreds 
of hours hosting students in events at Verizon offices. The events range from arranging job-shadowing days and leading workshops to delivering presentations about careers at Verizon.
The bulk of volunteer work that Flores leads springs from our relationship with the 
National Academy Foundation (NAF), a long-standing Verizon partner in boosting student achievement and career interest in STEM. Flores, a 14-year veteran of Verizon who serves as a manager in the Corporate Technology group in New Y ork City, works with NAF via her post as co-chair of the STEM Committee for the Women’s Association of Verizon Employees. 
Of late, Flores has set up events in Texas, Maryland and New Y ork in support of 
National Engineers Week.
Among the high points she lists in her busy volunteer life is hosting an international 
workshop that connected high school students in Manhattan and Argentina. She  
 is also proud to have shared her own career journey in numerous presentations to NAF students. 
Particularly gratifying to Flores is the effect these events have on young women. 
“When they get to know who we are — and learn that we’re not too different from them — it gives them so much confidence. ”
“Kids don’t immediately see the linkage between their 
interests, the subjects they’re studying and a career. They 
believe ‘science’ means test tubes or ‘computers’ mean 
programming. That’s why I love to help them discover the 
connection. When they get it, the shyness and reserve 
melts away. They have so many questions and so much to 
say. It really breaks down the barriers. ” —Carmen FloresCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FUNDAMENTALS | COMMUNITY SERVICE & PHILANTHROPY76

• Our New Y ork-area attorneys joined their colleagues from DLA Piper to staff a clinic that provided legal services to nonprofit organizations that improve the quality of life throughout the New Y ork City metropolitan area. The clinic was put together by the Lawyers Alliance for New Y ork.
