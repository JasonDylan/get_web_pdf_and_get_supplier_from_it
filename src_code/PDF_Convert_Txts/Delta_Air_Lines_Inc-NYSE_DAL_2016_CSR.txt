>I am regularly asked how Delta distinguishes itself as the 
industry leader time and again in a business known as much 
for its volatility as for its ingenuity. My response is always the same: No one else has our people. 
Delta’s top priority has always been to invest in each and 
every one of our more than 80,000 employees worldwide to ensure they have the tools and support they need to take care of our customers. Thanks to our employees, our customers reward us with their business and loyalty, which benefits the shareholders who invest their money back into Delta. We call it the virtuous circle, a simple concept but one that will sustain us for decades to come.
Whether you’re an employee, a customer, a business partner 
or a shareholder, all Delta stakeholders benefit from the decisions we make to drive the virtuous circle. At no other time was this more apparent than in 2016 — a year in which Delta again saw stellar profits, increased confidence from financial markets and unmatched investments in our people through pay increases, $1.5 billion in profit sharing and enhanced benefits programs. 
While we faced some notable challenges over the 12 months, 
Delta emerged stronger from each, with an even greater determination to maintain our position as the world’s most reliable, customer-centric and employee-focused airline. Notable accomplishments in 2016 included:
>  Delta enshrined our longstanding support for the communities where we live and serve, with a commitment to give back 1 percent of our net income from the previous year to key charitable organizations through cash contributions, in-kind travel and grants from The Delta Air Lines Foundation. 
>  We expanded our role as a global leader in the fight against human trafficking, with enhanced employee training and partnerships including End Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking and Out of Darkness.
>  Delta’s environmental sustainability efforts kicked into high gear as we began to replace 20 percent of our mainline narrowbody fleet over the next five years with fuel-efficient and comfortable A321s, Bombardier CS100s and Boeing 737-900ERs.>  We saved an incremental 9 million gallons of fuel in 2016 
through measures as simple as reducing onboard weight, lowering shades and opening vents in the passenger cabin when landing at warm destinations.
>  Delta also offset more than 3,200 metric tons of carbon emissions through our industry-leading carbon offset program that offers customers ways to lighten their own carbon footprint when flying, while we invested millions in facilities upgrades to lessen the airline’s carbon footprint on the ground and purchased offsets to maintain carbon neutral growth over our 2012 baseline.
Delta people were doing all this while investing millions in customer-facing technology, ranging from RFID bag tags that track bags in real time to innovative security line bag scanning lanes, to make the customer travel experience more enjoyable. 
Having the right people, principles and guidelines in place 
has helped us secure our current position as one of the world’s most admired airlines. At the core of our efforts is training, education and continual engagement with employees, customers, investors, government agencies and community leaders with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Pursuing minority- and woman-owned suppliers and holding vendors to Delta’s high ethical, environmental and human rights standards is part of that effort. 
This report is full of other examples and data that tell the story 
of our ongoing commitment to being a good steward of the environment, a positive force in the communities we serve, and a great place to work and fly. Sustainability is driving us forward and will be the key element in Delta’s continued success.
Thank you for taking the time to read Delta’s corporate  
responsibility report.

GOAL:  Experience no more than 90 combined 
Class I and Class II spills1. GOAL: Monitor and report air quality emissions 
at eight regulatory required facilities. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
1 Delta is required to report any spill over 5 gallons — these are recordable spills. 
2 Reportable spills are spills that are required to be reported to regulatory authorities based on the substance spilled and where it is spilled  
(e.g. into water vs. on land); different spills are subject to different provisions of state and federal rules.In 2016, 91 total spills were recorded. Of that 91, only 16 
were regulatory reportable spills2. In 2016 Delta experienced 
a 57 percent decrease in the number of Class I and Class II 
reportable spills compared to 2015.100% Emissions

GOAL:  Not to exceed 5 Notices. GOAL: Reduce year-over-year Scope 2 energy usage. 
In 2016 two NOVs were received from an environmental 
regulatory agency. One was associated with a failure to  
post a sanitary sewer grease discharge permit at one of  
our airport Sky Club locations. The second was associated  
with stormwater permit exceedances at one airport. Neither 
NOV resulted in a monetary penalty to the company.In 2016, large-scale corporate renovations began at our 
Atlanta headquarters that are anticipated to increase 
efficiency long-term. Renovations are planned through 
2017 with upgrades to include chillers, air conditioning 
and lighting. All projects from 2016 into 2017 are 
anticipated to contribute to continued reductions.ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  (Continued)

GRI Content  G4-32
We continue to report in accordance with 
comprehensive guidelines for GRI-G4 reporting standards. This report also provides additional information and data, not specified by GRI, that we 
and our stakeholders deem relevant to business 
operations. A complete GRI-G4 content index is included in this report beginning on page 88.
All GRI indicators are tagged in circular bubbles 
near the titles of chapters and their subsections. 
Each tag is color coded to represent one of our three 
sustainability pillars: Environmental (green), Social (blue) or Governance (red). These indicators are included in support of transparent and comparable disclosures within and across industries.External Assurance  G4-33
GRI recommends the use of external assurance, but does not require it to be in accordance with the Guidelines. We conduct assurance to verify our main environmental impact — carbon emissions. The external assurance 
statement for emissions is on page 103. SCS Global 
Services was engaged in 2016 to conduct carbon emissions verification for emissions year 2015 and to provide a reasonable level of assurance on our Statement of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions. Verified emissions data back to 2005 are publicly available on The Climate 
Registry at www.cris4.org.
Note that Delta’s annual GRI reporting timeline and annual 
emissions verification and reporting timelines do not coincide. For this reason, annual verification of emissions trail GRI reporting by one year. As a result, annual emissions for the 2016 CRR reporting year will be verified after 
this CRR has been published.Reporting Practices  G4-28  G4-29  G4-30  
This Corporate Responsibility Report (CRR) presents our defined material areas and metrics 
as of December 31, 2016. We issue our CRR on an annual basis. This 2016 report is an update 
to our previous report published in 2015. For all material Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), we present data for the current year, and data for at least three previous years. INTRODUCTION  |  Reporting PracticesDelta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          13Due to internal timeline reporting differences, 
any discrepancies from past CRR reporting to final 
verification will be noted in the SCS Global Services 
external verification statement and in relevant tables.

Materiality  G4-18
As part of GRI-G4 reporting guidelines, Delta periodically 
performs materiality assessments to identify which 
sustainability topics are most important to our stakeholders. 
Materiality in this context differs from the concept of 
materiality in a securities law perspective but helps 
guide our sustainability strategy and reporting. Our most 
recent materiality assessment was conducted in 2015.
Materiality Assessment Process  G4-25
In an effort to continually evaluate and determine 
which performance issues are key to operating a 
world-class airline, we directly engage a defined set 
of stakeholder groups through phone interviews and 
questionnaires. This type of direct engagement allows us to better understand the issues that are important 
to our stakeholders so we can provide excellent service 
in an evolving business environment. While our 
stakeholder engagement activities have historically 
been focused on customer service, satisfaction and 
support, our success in using this type of engagement 
for continuous improvement became the starting 
point for our materiality assessment process.We began our materiality assessment process through distribution of an ESG-focused questionnaire to stakeholder 
groups who had been defined and utilized before 2015. 
These stakeholder groups included investors, customers, 
employees, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities.
After completing the stakeholder outreach and 
engagement phase, we analyzed the results of the 
surveys by aggregating, prioritizing and categorizing more than 30 identified ESG issues. These issues ranged from organizational and operational impacts to sustainability trends affecting the airline industry. 
While the assessment process focused primarily on 
stakeholder priority issues, we also considered ESG 
issues that we deemed important to our business but which were not identified by stakeholders. We 
then divided all issues into environment, social and governance categories to match the ESG framework.
INTRODUCTION  |  Reporting Practices14         Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility ReportAfter narrowing the list, the result of our materiality 
assessment process identified 13 material issues vital to 
Delta’s long-term business success. They are as follows:
> Environmental Compliance
> Carbon Emissions/Climate Change> Energy Use
> Waste
> Social
> Customer Service
> Customer Safety & Security> Community Support & Engagement> Supply Chain Management> Governance> Employee Satisfaction & Safety
> Labor Relations
> Financial Performance
We have assigned each of these material issues a 
set of key performance indicators (KPIs), for which 
we have set goals and continue to track progress. 
Performance data and year-over-year progress can 
be found in this report on pages 5 through 11. All KPIs 
use either generally accepted or industry-standard metric protocols for reporting. Delta is committed to achieving stated goals and continuing to make progress annually on our KPIs.
External Industry Commitments & 
Associations  G4-15  G4-16

through corporate sustainability reporting helps us effectively engage with stakeholders, resulting in continuous improvement to our business over

Continuous engagement and regular dialogue with our stakeholders through both formal and informal 
processes allows us to innovate and proactively address emerging needs and risks. In addition to ongoing internal stakeholder engagement efforts and commitments, we regularly engage with external stakeholders on trending and emerging issues that matter to their organizations. To do this we periodically receive and respond to inquiries and requests for information related to the sustainability practices of our company. Our long-standing commitment to engagement allows us the opportunity to continue to refine corporate governance and corporate strategy over the long term.

the primary governance body responsible for addressing 
ESG policy risks. In 2016, the EELC received no reports 
of critical ESG concerns or issues. However, we remain 
aware of concerns related to the impact of carbon 
emissions and climate change from the aviation industry. In recognition of these concerns, we are actively engaged 
with ICAO efforts to establish an efficiency standard 
and a carbon-neutral growth initiative.

Allison Ausband
Senior VP — In-Flight Service
Giving Hope for Victims of Human Trafficking 
When Allison Ausband, Senior Vice President — In-Flight Service became Delta’s executive sponsor leading efforts to end human trafficking, the issue quickly became personal. One evening, her husband received a call from a sobbing coworker. “She suspected her daughter had been trafficked while walking to a 
friend’s house,” Ausband recalls. “She was trying to reach out to everyone she could to help find her.”
Ausband shared information about Polaris, which runs the National Human Trafficking Hotline. A week 
later, the woman’s daughter was returned home safely. 
“Human trafficking is a dark topic,” Ausband says. “It’s something that not everyone wants to get engaged 
with.” Yet as Ausband’s own experience revealed, trafficking knows no borders. It touches nearly every 
country in the world, affecting roughly 2.5 million women, children and men at any given moment. 
And while human trafficking can be uncomfortable to discuss, it’s not an issue that Delta plans to shy 
away from. That’s why we launched #GetOnBoard, a companywide program to encourage employees and customers to join the fight. As part of the effort, more than 30,000 Delta employees have taken part in Blue Lightning training, enabling them to spot indicators of possible trafficking in airports and 
on flights. SkyMiles members also can donate miles to Polaris through Delta’s SkyWish program to 
cover the airfare survivors need to return to their families and receive critical services.
“The research is heart-wrenching, and the needs are great,” Ausband says. “Whether we focus on raising 
awareness, preventing future trafficking, assisting with the justice process, supporting victim rehabilitation services or other forms of action in the communities we serve, our goal is to ensure Delta continues to 
make a lasting impact.”

We serve 180 million customers in 58 countries with 
industry-leading customer service and operational excellence. By excelling financially, Delta can focus  
on building system-wide capabilities and innovative solutions. We also can leverage brand and customer 
loyalty to address airline trends and risks.
Our employees are an important part of Delta’s  
success and underpin the quality, customer service  
and operational reliability that are core to Delta’s 
brand. During the December 2016 quarter, Delta pilots 
ratified a new contract that included an 18 percent pay 
rate increase that was retroactive to January 1, 2016. 
This increase for pilots followed pay rate increases for the majority of other employees during the December 
2015 quarter. In addition, our profit sharing payment to employees in February 2017 was the third consecutive 
annual profit sharing payment of more than $1 billion. We have paid eligible employees more than $5 billion in profit sharing since the program started in 2007 .  
We expect to continue to pay our employees industry-
leading total compensation because sharing the 
success that our employees help produce is core to Delta’s culture — important to providing the best travel experience for our customers and to producing consistent, sustainable results for shareholders.
Running a reliable, customer-focused airline produced 
a solid return on invested capital of 26.1 percent (non-GAAP) in 2016. Return on invested capital is calculated by dividing adjusted income ($6.9 billion) by average invested capital ($26.6 billion), which is the sum of adjusted book value of equity ($20.0 billion) and average adjusted net debt ($6.6 billion).Economic Performance

We primarily report on our organization and our 
financial performance through our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and investor relations website http://ir.delta.com. In this 
report, financial performance data focuses on economic 
performance as it relates to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The organizational entities covered in this CRR are the same as those presented in our Annual Report.Climate Effects on Our Business  G4-2  G4-EC2
Climate change presents both opportunities and risks related to Delta’s economic performance. Delta continues to reduce emissions from operations as we increase efficiency and service to our customers. Within our 
operations, we seek to minimize emissions primarily  
by using less fuel.
We have reduced our carbon emission levels since 
2005 [our baseline as reported to The Climate Registry (TCR)], by retiring and replacing older aircraft with 
newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft and by implementing 
fuel-saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations. Together, these initiatives are intended to help reduce our total carbon emissions.
Delta also continues to support efforts to develop 
alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air 
traffic control system in the United States. In addition, 
as we continue our long history of innovation, we anticipate being able to leverage our environmental management and mitigation capabilities to further reduce our emissions and climate impact.
As a responsible leader in the airline industry, we 
recognize that climate change is also a material regulatory risk. Concern about aviation environmental issues, including climate change and carbon emissions, has  
led to recognition of potential additional regulation and further taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions.
Due to the changing regulatory landscape in the U.S.  
and abroad, Delta realizes that we may face increasing 
regulations, taxes or other requirements which would require us to obtain additional permits or purchase allowances or offsets for emissions. Increases in regulation 
could also result in taxation or permitting requirements 
from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations.Economic Impact

In addition, climate change risks to business with respect 
to global regulation also vary around the world. One of these regulations is the European Union’s Emissions 
Trading Scheme (ETS). Established in 2005, the ETS is 
the world’s largest trading mechanism for carbon emissions allowances. For several years, the European Union has required its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its ETS. Under these regulations, any 
airline with flights originating or landing in the European 
Union is subject to the ETS and, beginning in 2012, was 
required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline 
exceeded the number of free allowances allocated. The ETS was amended to apply only to flights within the European Economic Area from 2013 through 2016. Because of this limitation to the EU ETS, we operated only 43 flights subject to the ETS through 2016.
Unless the EU amends the current legislation following 
the 2016 Assembly of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (“ICAO”), the ETS will apply to all flights 
originating or landing in the European Union beginning in  20 17.In 2016, ICAO also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce emissions from aircraft. The new aircraft certification standards apply to virtually all 
types of aircraft that make up the global commercial 
fleet and will be phased in between 2020 and 2028.
In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency  
(EPA) regulates aircraft emissions and has historically 
implemented emissions control standards adopted  
by ICAO. 
As a result of ongoing bilateral discussions between 
the U.S. and other nations, ICAO formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, in October of 2016. This program is designed to address the medium-term goal for the 
aviation industry of achieving carbon-neutral growth  
in international aviation beginning in 2020. GLOBAL CONNECTION  |  Economic Performance24         Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility ReportFlight Safety
Safety is an indispensable part of the Delta flight 
experience. The goal of Delta’s Flight Safety Program  
is to identify and eliminate hazards before they cause injuries to people or damage to aircraft or facilities. 
During 2016, Delta advanced our culture of safety 
through technology improvements and enhancements in safety data analysis. Data collection and analysis is a central element in improving operational safety performance. Our aircraft 
produce an enormous quantity of safety data derived 
from on-board data recorders. These recorders can continuously measure thousands of aircraft parameters from taxi out to taxi in. Once processed, the data presents us with a comprehensive picture of our operation; identifying vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. As evidence of our commitment to safety, Delta is 
retrofitting our fleet with new wireless technology 
which allows our aircraft to uplink performance data over a cellular network at the completion of a flight, thus eliminating the data delivery lag time associated with older recorders. This allows us to receive safety-critical data more efficiently so that we can respond more effectively to any identified concerns. Another 
example of our efforts to leverage the value of safety 
data is Delta’s investment in animation software. Since the information produced by the data recorders is so robust, this software allows us to produce animated videos of actual flights which greatly enhances pilot 
training and improves our investigative processes. 
 Delta has also invested in technology that greatly expands pilot awareness of turbulence and other weather-related phenomena. For the last several years Delta participated in a collaborative project with the FAA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) that developed a product called Eddy Dissipation Rate (EDR). In this 
ground breaking project, some of our aircraft, equipped 
with special sensors, download flight performance data 
to a ground-based server while the aircraft is airborne. 
Using a series of sophisticated algorithms, the data is 
automatically analyzed to measure the level of turbulence the aircraft is currently experiencing. This information GLOBAL CONNECTION  |  Customer Health & Safety
Customer Health & Safety G4-DMA  G4-PR1  
Ensuring the health, safety and security of our customers is paramount. To fulfill this promise 
to our customers while providing the highest levels of service in the air and on the ground, we 
put special focus on flight safety, emergency preparedness, customer health and the handling of dangerous goods.Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          25is then sent back to be displayed on tablet computers 
used by our pilots in the cockpit. Equally important, the 
turbulence values are fed into a very robust model called 
NowCast which adds a predictive depiction tool to increase 
weather awareness. Updating every 15 minutes, NowCast provides coverage in areas lacking timely EDR data. The 
information derived from the EDR data provides our pilots 
with a three-dimensional, real-time depiction of the actual 
location and severity of the turbulence. Currently more 
than 250 of Delta’s aircraft are equipped with EDR technology, and the critical weather information it produces is available to all of our pilots. Our pilots then use the information to adjust the route of flight to 
minimize the level of turbulence experienced by the 
aircraft and improve the inflight experience of our 
customers while enhancing safety levels. Delta is currently in discussion with several domestic and 
international airlines to share EDR, with the hopes of equipping most of the aircraft that fly throughout the 
world with this amazing technology.
Another internal program is Flight Operational Quality 
Assurance (FOQA). During 2016, Delta FOQA continued 
work with internal and external stakeholders to advance 
program policies, procedures and technology in cooperation 
with the pilot labor union. Our main objective is to increase 
the use of FOQA data to improve safety and efficiency of flights. This collaboration is a testament to the strength of the relationship and safety focus of the management 
and labor teams at Delta. Since the ratification of the 
Crosstalk Agreement in 2015, over 40 users now have 
access to the same data sources used by FOQA for predictive maintenance, propulsion engineering and fuel savings.
In addition to advancements made internally, Delta 
also participates in and leads multiple industry safety 
initiatives. For example, we participate in a working group that uses the FAA’s Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) system. ASIAS promotes the open exchange of de-identified safety information 
to continuously improve aviation safety. We also are an 
active participant leader with Delta Connection, SkyTeam 
and other organizations throughout the aviation industry. Engagement with these groups ensures that Delta Flight 
Safety remains committed to the safety of every passenger and employee onboard our flights.
Safety Management System (SMS)
Delta’s complex operation requires flight operations, ramp operations, catering, cargo, maintenance, crew 
scheduling, dispatch and meteorology to work together to 
succeed. Each operational area presents its own challenges and risks. Delta’s comprehensive SMS assesses each piece individually and systemically to identify potential hazards throughout our entire operational system.
Since its development in 2006, Delta’s SMS has matured 
into a strong, successful and healthy foundation for our evolving daily operational processes. The keys to 
its success are employee engagement, leadership 
support and communication. Our frontline employees 
are the eyes and ears of our operation, and are best 
positioned to identify daily hazards and offer solutions. 
Constant analysis of systems, processes and procedures 
provides ongoing opportunities to proactively identify 
hazards before an incident occurs. Effective hazard GLOBAL CONNECTION  |  Customer Health & Safety

Operations.26         Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Reportreporting by all employees throughout the organization 
helps to ensure we address issues in a timely manner. 
The strong relationship we have with our connection 
carriers and SkyTeam Alliance partners helps Delta gather and assess safety-related data, best practices 
and lessons learned.
Customer Health 
Our commitment to our customers’ safety includes 
their health condition during flight. Our in-flight 
medical capabilities provide best-in-class safety that 
exceeds FAA regulatory guidance for on-board medical 
equipment, supplies, medication and ground medical 
physician support. Delta also accommodates battery-operated medical devices, including portable oxygen 
concentrators that have been pre-approved by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation and Delta to ensure 
compatibility with aviation electronic systems.
In rare cases, customers may need assistance that  
goes beyond the treatment we can provide. That’s  
why we voluntarily contract with STAT-MD, a division 
of emergency medicine services of the University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center. STAT-MD provides 24/7 
ground-based medical support for all domestic and 
international in-flight medical events, in addition to 
pre-flight medical fitness-to-fly consultative support.STAT-MD physician consultants are board-certified emergency medicine physicians who understand Delta’s 
on-board medical capabilities and the effects of 
altitude on physiology in flight. During in-flight medical occurrences, these trained physicians consult from the ground and provide treatment recommendations, which 
could include diverting a flight to provide a patient 
with more immediate medical care. This consultation happens in collaboration with pilots in the flight deck, flight attendant first responders, passenger medical volunteers, if available, and the flight’s dispatcher from 
the Operations and Customer Center. 
Emergency Planning & Operations
In today’s global environment, companies must be 
prepared for whatever challenges come their way. 
Delta’s Business Continuity and Emergency Response 
programs provide training and support that ensures 
plans are in place to appropriately respond to any crisis impacting our airline. Thanks to this training, Delta’s 
highly skilled responders can work through any disaster 
by quickly assessing the situation, using pre-developed 
plans and developing an action plan to be used throughout 
the crisis. Frequent drills and simulations keep our 
employees familiar with response processes and 
equipped to respond at a moment’s notice. They also 
help us understand areas of improvement, and we 
continually make improvements to our plans outside  
of an actual emergency.GLOBAL CONNECTION  |  Customer Health & Safety
Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          27Delta Business Continuity engages all divisions to develop 
secondary business processes aimed at minimizing disruption to our customers during a business failure. We maintain daily vigilance to ensure our teams are 
ready to respond to any crisis that affects our company, 
employees and customers. 
Once such disruption occurred in August 2016, when 
Delta incurred a catastrophic failure of our primary data center. Due to a power switching device failure, 
hundreds of network devices and applications were 
rendered inoperable. Though most were back online within hours, the damage to the day’s flight schedule was swift and devastating. We quickly established our crisis command center and started working through the enormous issues that resulted from a severely delayed operation. While it was a painful few days for our customers and employees, our teams worked around the clock to reset the highly complex schedule of 
approximately 3,000 flights per day, consisting of more 
than 800 aircraft, managed by our 84,245 worldwide employees. Today, Delta is working harder than ever and investing hundreds of millions of dollars to ensure our operation is safe and reliable, 365 days a year, even during a catastrophic failure of one of our data centers.

Responding in a CrisisIt was early morning in the U.S. when news broke of large explosions at Brussels’ Zaventem airport. 
We didn’t know then that one of the explosions 
had gone off near a ticket counter that Delta used, or whether there were injuries or fatalities. We 
simply knew we needed to help. 
Delta quickly dispatched a small contingent of our 
Care and Go-T eam to Brussels via Amsterdam. The 
team set up a local command center to start helping 
passengers who had been affected — passengers like Laye Kane Jallow, who was returning home to New York after visiting his girlfriend in the Belgian capital. Jallow was hospitalized with severe burns. Two Delta Care T eam employees met him after surgery to offer their support — and even helped 
him celebrate his birthday during his recovery. Ultimately, Delta sent 50 Care and Go-T eam responders to Brussels. Our valued SkyT eam 
partners, Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, 
also sent their employee Care T eams to assist 
Delta in our response. We are grateful to those 
who gave their time at the Care T eam’s phone

faced with the unthinkable.
28         Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Reportwe make certain we’re meeting requirements for all the 
international destinations in which Delta operates. 
We take great pride in our all-volunteer force of more than 
2,500 employees from Delta and our Delta Connection partners. These volunteers, known as the Care Team, 
are specially trained in working with survivors and 
families of an aviation disaster. The Care Team is 
composed of compassionate, caring individuals who 
are on call for immediate deployment to any worldwide destination if the need arises. Assistance can include making flight arrangements, assisting with ground transportation, arranging hotel accommodations, 
providing food and emergency clothing, and helping 
keep passengers and family members informed. Care 
Team members also help coordinate communication among hospitals, airport officials and organizations 
like the Red Cross or Red Crescent, and can be a shoulder to lean on to get through a difficult time. Care Team 
members worldwide speak at least 19 languages and 
come from more than two dozen countries — helping our customers feel a little more at home, no matter where they are in the world.Dangerous Goods Handling 
The careful management of dangerous goods is another essential component of safety. The Dangerous Goods Management Group at Delta manages and oversees handling of dangerous goods, as well as 
implementation of companywide dangerous goods 
policies. Due to strict regulations by domestic and international authorities related to acceptance, handling and transport, our dangerous goods program 
is operated as part of our quality management system.
The program is specifically tasked with:
>  E stablishing hazardous materials and dangerous 
goods standards
>  E valuating operations against those standards
>  R ecommending appropriate improvements
>  P romoting awareness and compliance
At the end of 2016, Delta assessed the risk posed by 
lithium-ion battery-powered personal electronic devices (PEDs) and elected to mitigate the onboard risk posed by overheating PEDs by rolling out containment bags across 
our fleet. These containment bags are designed to cool 
an overheating PED or stop the spread of a PED fire. The GLOBAL CONNECTION  |  Customer Health & Safety

all information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.
The CyberSecurity Program ensures the confidentiality, 
integrity and availability of critical business information. 
It also takes steps to maintain the privacy of information 
we hold regarding our customers and employees. All Delta employees are expected to play their part in maintaining general information security and privacy as they handle corporate and customer information in their job functions. Customer Satisfaction  
Building long-lasting relationships with our customers is one of Delta’s top priorities. To do 
this, we strive each day to provide the most reliable, safe and convenient experience possible 
on every flight and through every interaction. This includes calls to our Customer Engagement Centers, and customer inquiries through social media. Delta prides itself on having received Contact Center Certification from J.D. Power and Associates three years in a row — the only 
airline ever to earn the title. In addition, Delta continues to enhance the travel experience 
through improvements to technology, streamlined security procedures and an unrelenting 
focus on safety.GLOBAL CONNECTION  |  Customer SatisfactionDelta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          31To mitigate existing and emerging threats related to 
cybersecurity, Delta has established four workgroups that support the information security of our global operations:
 
>  Cyber Access Management provides controlled access 
to systems by employees, contractors and vendors
>  Cyber Threat Unit works with Information Technology 
(IT) to provide enterprise-wide response capability, strengthening Delta’s front line of defense against a rapidly shifting threat environment
>  CyberSecurity Governance establishes security policies and standards, conducts risk assessments, and promotes security-related training and awareness programs while ensuring legislative and regulatory compliance 
>  Security Solutions Group (SSG) provides enterprise solutions and shared services to the IT, Human Resources and Legal departments; including eDiscovery, Identity and Access Engineering and AutomationCyberSecurity independently and objectively assesses the controls, reliability and integrity of Delta’s IT environment to ensure we are compliant with legislation and regulatory 
requirements. This helps us ensure our controls are 
working as efficiently and effectively as possible. 
Delta also seeks out the opinions of industry experts  
to ensure that our cybersecurity program is effective. 
These assessments are both voluntary and compliance-  
based. Following these third-party assessments and 
audits, we have implemented additional security controls 
and technologies to ensure we are keeping pace with current cyber threats and trends for a secure enterprise. In 2016, our program matured with the appointment of a new Chief Information Officer, Rahul Samant. GLOBAL CONNECTION  |  Customer Satisfaction

RFID T echnology
Maps are an integral part of travel. But for those taking to the sky with checked bags, the ability to see a piece of luggage’s journey “mapped” from one 
plane to the next has been lacking. That’s finally 
changing thanks to baggage tracking technology using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). 
This move marks a historic shift for Delta and the 
120 million bags we handle annually. RFID will replace barcode hand scanning — the industry 
standard since the early 90s. With this new 
technology, scanners use radio waves to capture highly accurate and consistent data stored on an RFID chip embedded in the luggage tag. That means fewer missing bags — and real-time tracking information at customers’ fingertips via the Fly Delta mobile app. With a $50 million investment in RFID at 344 stations 
around the globe, we aim to reliably deliver every 
bag on every flight. Since the new technology rolled out, bags have been tracked with 99.9 percent success. All domestic Delta stations now offer map views of a bag’s journey, with international stations soon to follow — creating unprecedented transparency for customers everywhere.
32         Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility ReportCybersecurity Awareness
In today’s world of data breaches, cyber-attacks and 
increased connectivity, it is paramount that every Delta employee is prepared to protect Delta’s valuable information assets. Employees play a critical role in 
cyber threat defense, and the best strategy for 
detecting and thwarting attacks is a vigilant and cyber-aware workforce. 
Every employee and contractor with access to Delta’s 
information systems completes annual information-
security and privacy training that is tailored to our 
business environment and updated as new technology and associated security and privacy issues emerge. Additional training and education programs are provided to key audiences, such as IT developers and people who process credit cards. We also provide practical guidance on cybersecurity issues throughout the year 
to employees and managers across the company. Our CyberSecurity Awareness Program also consists of 
quarterly awareness and engagement events, including National Cybersecurity Awareness Month and Privacy 
Day — an international effort held annually to create awareness about the importance of privacy and 
protecting personal information. Awareness campaigns 
throughout the year focus on hot topics such as phishing, anti-tampering, data classification and ensuring a 
secure workspace.
The CyberSecurity Division manages these programs 
and is responsible for our Information Security Policy and Standards. Cybersecurity training and awareness serve to not only educate employees about how to protect 
Delta’s information assets, but also to give employees 
and their families the tools they need to protect 
themselves in the digital world. We understand that 
cybersecurity education transcends the workplace. 
When our employees learn how to protect our customers’ 
privacy, they can protect themselves from the dangers 
of cybercrime and identity theft, too.GLOBAL CONNECTION  |  Customer Satisfaction

We understand that our SCM is a component of providing 
long-term sustainable support to our customers. To do this, we work hand in hand with vendors and suppliers to manage the services and products they provide. 
There are many links in our supply chain beyond procurement. 
These include logistics, distribution, materials management and transportation. 
We partner with our suppliers and business units to manage 
services using the following values: 
>  Integrity and ethical behavior 
>  Fact-based decision making >  Challenging the status quo

Our strategic sourcing process defines how we work with suppliers to ensure that they are operating up to our standards. This includes a due-diligence policy to screen all key suppliers for potential environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) risk factors. Following this 
process helps eliminate any potential negative impacts of our global supply chain — which in turn helps Delta improve. We hold ourselves to the same high standards as our suppliers, adhering to operational ESG requirements and using mechanisms for monitoring, reporting and 
correcting ESG issues.
Supply Chain  
Delta is firmly committed to social, environmental and economic responsibility in all our 
operations. Delta’s Supply Chain Management (SCM) professionals operate at a level 
befitting a global airline leader, following rigorous internal material standards for sourcing, procurement and selection of our suppliers and business partners. 34         Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility ReportThe two most important documents we use to verify that 
our suppliers adhere to sustainable business practices are our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Sustainability Guidelines. In 2016, we distributed the Supplier Code of 
Conduct to all vendors and required them to read and agree 
to comply with all requirements. 
To further ensure continuous improvement, we offer a 
Supplier Performance Management program. The program includes the use of monthly performance scorecards, 
periodic business reviews and discussions on developing 
and maintaining sustainable business processes. In 2016, 73 key suppliers participated. Taking ESG factors into account when we select suppliers adds shareholder value by reducing risks.  
It also addresses customer desires to do business with a company that values ethical business practices. 
Commitment to Supplier Diversity  G4-EC9
Delta recognizes the critical role suppliers play in our global value chain. As a global service provider, “local” to us means maximizing our responsible returns to stakeholders through diversity and by requiring 
significant expenditures in the communities we serve. 
Expenditures include contracted labor, facility rents and landing fees that support local airport station operations across the Delta system. GLOBAL CONNECTION  |  Supply Chain

In 2016, about 16 percent, or $5.1 billion, of Delta’s  
$31 billion in supplier spend was sourced locally. If jet fuel 
and related items are excluded, the percentage of supplier 
spend sourced locally increases to about 26 percent.
Commitment to diversity in our supply chain means ensuring that our supplier base reflects the diversity of 
our customers. To do this, we set annual spend targets 
with minority- and women-owned businesses, and we 
measure progress toward achieving these targets.Our annual spend with minority- and women-owned businesses reached $682.3 million in 2016. We’ve 
achieved this high level by identifying viable, diverse 
companies — then helping them understand and 
develop the capabilities required to compete successfully for Delta business. We encourage our Tier I suppliers to 
build similar relationships with diverse businesses.

Vendor Assessments
You might not think of textiles as a major product 
category for Delta to source. But in fact, we use more than 100 million textile units on board our flights, from pillowcases and hot towels to 
potholders and our iconic red blankets. 
We recognize that the global textile industry faces 
significant ethical, environmental and human rights risks. So the last time we launched a request for proposals from textile suppliers, we went a step 
further by starting to examine suppliers’ working 
conditions, emergency procedures, environmental impact and business ethics on an annual basis. 
More than just legal compliance, this focus on 
sustainable sourcing fulfills a significant, long-term commitment to ethical and responsible 
procurement. Delta people personally visited  27 factories and evaluated them on more than  
60 prequalification criteria such as visible exit 
signs, workers’ ability to discuss suggestions with management and factories’ health and safety records. 
The process led us to choose four leading facilities 
that met our requirements. Through this and other 
initiatives, we’re ensuring smart sourcing of the 
in-flight items we provide to our customers.

A New Narrowbody Fleet
In 2016, jet fuel was Delta’s second largest expense, behind salaries and related expense, and the 
largest contributor to our carbon emissions. So increasing fuel efficiency anywhere we can provides benefits for both our bottom line and our environmental footprint. 
A major way we’re doing this is by replacing older aircraft with newer models that offer lower 
operating costs and better fuel efficiency. Since 2009, Delta has retired over 280 50-seat regional jets and more than 130 older narrowbody aircraft, while refreshing our fleet with over 300 new aircraft. Over the next five years, we have committed to replacing another 20 percent of our mainline narrowbody fleet. Several purchases in 2016 helped us make progress toward this promise: 
>  Airbus A321s — These aircraft will replace older-generation jets, including the MD-88. In addition to other energy-saving upgrades, wingtip Sharklets on these planes will provide fuel efficiency improvements of up to 4 percent.
>  Bombardier CS100s — Powered by a turbofan PW1500G engine, the CS100 uses advanced technology and composite materials to deliver reduced noise and 20 percent better fuel efficiency compared to similar-sized aircraft. It will enter service with Delta in spring 2018. 
>  Boeing 737-900ERs — 737-900ERs make no more noise than a truck driving along a highway, enabling them to access even highly regulated airports. Thanks to advanced engine and structural design, they also offer 9 to 14 percent reductions in carbon emissions and fuel consumption per seat.
 
Customers are benefiting from these new aircraft, too. Improved design makes for a widebody feel in a narrowbody aircraft, meaning wider seats, large windows and ample overhead bin space. (The CS100 boasts the largest windows in the single-aisle market.) Aircraft will also feature the latest in-flight entertainment, full-spectrum LED ambient lighting, standard 110-volt power at every row and in-flight 
Wi-Fi and Delta Studio. 
These purchases are just a preview of what’s to come. Over the next several years, we’ll continue to 
modernize our fleet, increasing customer satisfaction while traveling lighter in the skies.

Management Approach to  
Environmental Compliance  G4-DMA
We understand that environmental regulations 
are minimum requirements. Where government regulations do not exist, we operate responsibly by following the best practices of the aviation industry. 
T o enable accountability and promote continuous 
compliance and improvement, we set annual environmental compliance goals that include: > Number and volume of spills> Number of Notices of Violation/Non-Compliance
>  Number o f core tasks completed on time in  
our Environmental Management Information  
System (EMIS) 
> Compliance with air-quality regulations
> Compliance with hazardous waste regulationsCommunicating progress on our goals encourages further transparency. T o ensure the highest levels 
of transparency, we communicate with leadership monthly and quarterly, and share progress with stakeholders annually in this report. 
Our compliance approach also includes the day-to-day 
work of our Environmental Coordinators (ECs) across 
the Delta system. Throughout the United States, 
ECs are located at all mainline airport stations and Delta-operated maintenance locations. They ensure compliance and coordinate environmental actions, including conducting inspections, keeping records, serving as liaisons between airport environmental 
staff and regulatory authorities and overseeing airport 
service contractors whose actions may directly impact the environment. ECs also communicate compliance efforts to operating divisions and leadership at their respective stations. ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Environmental Compliance
Environmental Compliance  
Being environmentally responsible means complying with all environmental laws and 
regulations, both those that govern our industry and those in all places where we operate, 
as well as minimizing the environmental impact of our operations.Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          39Compliance T ools
A robust system of continuous environmental auditing 
promotes accountability and environmental awareness throughout our system. Audits also create education and awareness as audit team findings and on-site observations 
are communicated to station and divisional leaders. This 
process, in turn, allows us to work toward continuous compliance by identifying operational and process improvements at stations and maintenance facilities. 
Building upon findings gathered through audits, we 
use an internally developed manual that contains 
site-specific, as well as system-wide, compliance policies and procedures. The Environmental Programs Manual (EPM) helps ensure compliance by providing on-site guidance on how to follow environmental regulations. The EPM is managed at a corporate level and is updated frequently to ensure that it addresses 
all applicable federal, state and local environmental 
regulations and that it provides a consistent set of guidelines and best management practices for all Delta operations.
Delta’s Environmental Management System (EMS) 
is another internally developed management tool. 
We use it to proactively manage and track station-specific compliance tasks, which helps airport stations develop a routine of documenting and monitoring environmental compliance. EMS users can read descriptions of all airport station environmental roles and responsibilities, including tasks and requirements. 
They can also assess and identify environmental 
aspects and impacts, and inspect and document control requirements. Our Environmental Management Information System 
(EMIS) is a web-based tracking tool that works 
with EMS and gives stations an additional layer of 
compliance support. Compliance information and data 
can be entered online, allowing it to be monitored by corporate, divisional and operational leaders. 
Spills and Other Violations  G4-EN24
Our environmental policies include procedures for all materials to prevent any harmful substances from our operations from entering the environment. These procedures explain how to store and handle all Delta-required substances and materials. This includes 
petroleum products like jet fuel, diesel fuel, gasoline 
and hydraulic fluid as well as other substances such as 
glycol-based deicing fluids. 
Our first step and ongoing goal is to prevent spills 
from occurring. However, in the event of a spill, Delta 
people are trained to follow internally approved and 
externally compliant procedures for mitigation. ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Environmental Compliance
40         Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility ReportWhen a spill happens, we manage the spill in an 
environmentally responsible manner, containing 
it, beginning cleanup and completing all required 
regulatory reporting and documentation of the incident. 
Finally, involved personnel communicate the incident to station and division leadership. At that point, corporate 
environmental managers conduct a comprehensive 
analysis of the entire incident. Their goal is to gather 
any lessons to be learned from the experience, so we 
can prevent future spills from happening.
T o continually improve our progress on spills, we  
set goals for our operating divisions and track spill 
performance throughout the year. Where required 
under spill reporting guidelines, for volumetric amounts 
of Class I
1 and Class II2 spills, or spills entering a storm 
drain, we report incidents to local, state and federal regulatory agencies. Other reportable environmental 
compliance areas include effluent, emissions and 
waste, but can include any regulated material that may enter the environment. We investigate all Class I and II spills to determine causes and contributing factors. This helps us develop solutions that benefit all of our stations. 
In 2016, Delta experienced a decrease in the number 
of reportable spills overall. While our total number of recordable (not reportable) Class I and Class II spills was 91, one above our goal, this number reflects a total 
of only 16 regulatory reportable spills, a 57 percent 
decrease over 2015.
We received two notices of violation (NOV) from an 
environmental regulatory agency in 2016. One NOV 
was for not posting a sanitary sewer grease discharge 
permit at one of our airport Sky Club locations, and 
the second was associated with storm water permit 
exceedances at one airport. Neither NOV resulted in  
a monetary penalty to the company.ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Environmental Compliance

Air Quality  G4-EN20  G4-EN21
T o help improve air quality around airports, our airport 
stations and T echnical Operations facilities comply with local, state, city, county and district requirements. Third-party environmental professionals review and audit 
our air quality programs for compliance as necessary. 
These audits include a multifaceted inspection of agency reporting, emissions records and work practices. 
Delta tracks stationary and mobile equipment that 
contains ozone-depleting substances (ODS), chemicals 
that destroy stratospheric ozone. These substances are 
commonly found in aerosol products, foams and fire extinguishers. They are also used as refrigerants in air conditioning and cooling equipment. 
ODS Class I and II refrigerants are categorized based 
on their ozone-depleting potential. Because these 
units contain regulated substances, only certified 
technicians can perform maintenance that involves accessing the refrigerant-containing circuits. During required maintenance and servicing, we take all appropriate measures to prevent release of ODS into the atmosphere. Where feasible, we acquire or retrofit 
equipment that contains a substitute refrigerant with 
a lower global warming potential.In addition, eight Delta facilities must file routine 
emissions inventory reports due to individual state 
requirements. This includes tracking five criteria 
pollutants that may contribute to climate change: 
carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), sulfur oxides (SO2x) and 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Seven sites 
require regulatory reporting annually; however, 
one requires reporting every three years. The eight

Progress on Air Quality in California
At the end of 2016, Delta was compliant with all 
mobile source equipment rules in California, which are more stringent than those imposed on our other domestic operations. Delta’s goal in California is to 
meet the air emissions requirements set by the state. 
In addition, we set our ground support equipment replacement and retrofit schedules in California to meet those required by regulation.
Our off-road diesel fleet in California proactively 
achieved the 2018 target of 4.6 grams of NOx per 
brake horsepower-hour, a standard measure for heavy-duty and nonroad engines. We achieved this target due to electric vehicle credits obtained by using electric off-road vehicles in place of diesel vehicles.We also surpassed the large spark ignition engine targets for forklift and non-forklift subsets. For the forklift group, we exceeded the mandate for 
hydrocarbon (HC) and NOx emissions (1.1 g/bhp-hr) with our fleet average of 0.94 g/bhp-hr. For the non-
forklift group, we exceeded the mandate for HC and 
NOx emissions (2.5 g/bhp-hr) with our fleet average of 2.38 g/bhp-hr.
Finally, we met 2017 compliance targets for the diesel 
Air T oxics Control Measure. T o do this, we achieved the particulate matter standard of 0.18 g/bhp-hr for engines under 175 horsepower and 0.08 g/bhp-hr for engines between 175–750 horsepower.

Waste Management  G4-DMA  
Reducing the waste that we generate is important both for meeting our 
environmental compliance commitments and lowering our overall environmental 
impact. We continually assess our waste streams and waste handling operations to identify high-value materials for reuse and recycling, as well as ways to minimize what we send to landfills. We have identified four main waste streams varying by 
material type and regulatory handling requirements.

Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          45Hazardous Waste  G4-EN23  G4-EN25
Delta is committed to meeting all regulatory standards 
for safety and maintenance. In meeting these required standards, we acknowledge that hazardous wastes are a byproduct of operating a safe and compliant commercial 
airline. Recognizing the negative societal and environmental 
impacts of improper handling and disposal of hazardous waste — including harm to the health of our employees and local communities — Delta meets all applicable regulatory handling and disposal requirements. 
We achieved our 2016 goal for hazardous waste, 
432.22 tons, a decrease of more than 13 tons compared  
to 2015. Our 2017 goal is 425 tons of hazardous waste. We will track and monitor this goal monthly. Establishing this goal increases transparency and compels us to continuously identify ways to reduce our environmental impact. 
Non-Hazardous Waste 
Operating a major airline includes not only management of our own waste, but also customer-generated waste materials. Delta-generated waste includes waste from operations, maintenance and 
construction activities at airports and other locations 
where partners can segregate our materials and send us waste stream volumes. 
Understanding and handling this complex mix of waste 
material streams means that not all non-hazardous waste that is generated can be recycled or diverted 
from a landfill. Working toward the highest possible 
diversion rate, we continually seek to identify both 
materials and opportunities to increase our landfill 
diversion efforts. 
Much like our approach to hazardous waste, in 
2016 we targeted year-over-year improvements for 
reducing the non-hazardous waste volume generated in our operations. In 2016, we produced 415 tons of 
non-hazardous waste that could not be diverted from 
the waste stream or recycled. This number is up from our reported 148.5 tons in 2015. We attribute this 
uptick to growth in operations, and to an additional 
220 tons of contaminated soils removed during airport construction projects that could not be diverted. 
Reusable Material   
Embracing the Delta culture of innovation, we have 
established relationships with a variety of vendors and 
partners to further reduce our environmental impact. 
Through these partnerships, Delta employees identify 
high-value items for reuse, and our vendors and 
partners receive the materials to give them a second 
life as new products or as product inputs. These 
innovative diversion programs, known as upcycling, also contribute to environmental responsibility by 
reducing the amount of new materials needed to 
produce new products in the marketplace. ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Waste Management

leather seat covers and 12,537 pounds of curtains from 
landfills through upcycling efforts. In addition, stations 
across the system routinely donate our red in-flight blankets to shelters, and in 2016, we added reusable 
cabin curtains to our landfill diversion efforts.
Recyclable Material
A major way we’re reducing our environmental impact 
is by identifying and diverting valuable recyclable 
materials from our waste streams. We’re doing this 
both through recycling goods on flights where we 
maintain control of the materials at a station level, 
and by encouraging our employees to recycle at 
home and at work using our Atlanta-based Employee Recycling Center. In both efforts, we donate all rebate funds earned to Delta community and employee 
support programs. 
In-Flight Recycling
Delta’s in-flight co-mingled recycling program, in operation since 2007, is a great example of our commitment 
to reducing our environmental impact in the air and on 
the ground. While the program is not available on every Delta flight due to destination airport service availability and operational constraints, we do offer onboard recycling options at destination cities with 
existing recycling options. We collect single-stream 
materials including plastic, aluminum and paper during 
flights and bag them for diversion. Upon flight arrival, 
the materials are collected by the Cabin Service team 
and transported to airport recycling centers. 
Delta catering partners at select airport stations also 
collect and recycle empty cans and bottles purposely 
left in beverage carts. We do not always receive 
rebates or volumes for these materials due to airport-specific protocols for removing waste, but we are nevertheless committed to removing these items from 
the waste stream. 
In 2016, there were 35 domestic recycling locations 
and one international recycling location across the 
Delta system. We continue to donate rebates earned from Delta’s in-flight recycling program to Habitat 
for Humanity through Delta’s Force for Global Good. 
T otal rebates from 2007 to 2016 totaled more than 
$911,000. These funds have been used, along with 
Delta employee volunteer hours, to fund and build 
eight Habitat for Humanity houses in five Delta cities.
In-Flight Recycling Challenges
Combined, materials handling and infrastructure issues 
pose a challenge to capturing and reporting progress on in-flight recycling efforts. At some domestic locations, 
we encounter challenges in measuring diversion rates 
and understanding trends for recycling efforts once materials leave our aircraft. At these stations, our waste and recycling material streams are co-mingled with other carriers’ or with an airport’s own recycling program. This difficulty, combined with more airports 
developing their own recycling programs, means that 
we foresee continued challenges in capturing, tracking and monitoring total volumes for our recycling efforts.
International flight regulations also pose challenges to 
increasing in-flight recycling. The U.S. Department of 
Agriculture considers some materials from international 
flights contaminated with meat, dairy and/or produce 
to be regulated waste, which must be incinerated or otherwise treated to ensure there is no contamination 
to domestic U.S. agriculture. Similar rules regulating 
this material exist in every country to which we fly. For 
this reason, Delta’s greatest challenge remains how 
best to collect and separate materials to keep recyclable 
materials uncontaminated both onboard the aircraft 
and upon arrival at the international flight kitchen. ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Waste ManagementDelta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          47While significant hurdles remain before a full-scale 
international recycling program can begin, we remain 
dedicated to implementation.
Employee Recycling Program
In support of the largest concentration of Delta 
employees and Delta office space domestically,  
the Employee Recycling Center (ERC) in Atlanta provides a place for all employees to recycle and 
process recyclables from our Atlanta headquarters. Employees can bring materials that include aluminum cans, plastic bottles, glass, tin and paper. 
In 2016, we also launched a formalized employee 
recycling program at the Atlanta T echnical Operations 
Maintenance base. Employees had been informally recycling there for years. In late 2016, we established  
a company program to allow employees to recycle in 
their workspace. With this new effort now viewed as a 
pilot program, we are working with all Atlanta-based 
stakeholders to conduct an ERC analysis that will be used to establish new baseline goals for recycling.
The ERC donates all rebate funds to the Delta 
Employee & Retiree Care Fund to help individuals who 
suffer from severe financial hardship resulting from unforeseen and unavoidable crises such as natural disasters. In 2016, employee recycling efforts in Atlanta were responsible for direct revenue donations 
of $1,324.47. T o date, we have donated a total of 
$57,920 since the program began in 2008.ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Waste Management

Management Approach to Climate Change  
& Carbon Emissions  G4-DMA
The largest source of transportation-related emissions is 
small passenger vehicles. In total, small passenger vehicles account for over half of transportation sector emissions, with the remaining emissions coming from other 
transportation sources, including commercial aircraft. 
While aviation accounts for only 2 percent of global 
manmade carbon emissions, the aviation industry continues to focus on ways to reduce emissions  
and tackle climate change. Responding to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
assessment, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), representing 90 percent of international air traffic, committed in 2007 to a four-pillar strategy to reduce CO
2 emissions, including technology, operations, 
infrastructure and positive economic measures. In addition, it set the following three goals: 
>  Shor t-T erm Goal: Improve efficiency through an 
average improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5 percent 
per year from 2009 to 2020 
>  Medium- T erm Goal: Achieve carbon-neutral growth —  
A cap on net international aviation CO 2 emissions 
from 2020 
>  L ong-T erm Goal: Reduce absolute emissions — 
Reduction in net aviation CO 2 emissions of  
50 percent by 2050, relative to 2005 levels 
In October 2016, ICAO formally adopted a global, 
market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International 
Aviation. This program is designed to facilitate the 
medium-term goal of achieving carbon-neutral growth 
in international aviation beginning in 2020. Pilot and 
first phases, beginning in 2021 and subsequently in 2024, are voluntary and will be followed by a mandatory 
second phase beginning in 2027. Climate Change & Carbon Emissions  
Globally, the transportation sector includes all modes of transportation — cars, trucks, 
trains, ships, airplanes and other vehicles. The majority of emissions resulting from the 
combustion of petroleum-based products, including gasoline and jet fuel, come from carbon dioxide (CO
2).ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Climate Change & Carbon EmissionsDelta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          49In addition to these commitments, aircraft manufacturers 
are also working to reduce carbon emissions. In February 
2016, after more than six years of negotiations, ICAO’s 
Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) 
agreed on a new CO 2 emissions standard for aircraft. In 
April 2017 ICAO completed the adoption process for a 
first-ever CO 2 emissions standard for aircraft.
The standard is set to go into effect for new aircraft 
types in 2020 and for in-production aircraft types in 2023. The standard will not apply to existing in-service aircraft.

G4-EN3  G4-EN5  G4-EN6  G4-EN18  G4-EN19
We examine every aspect of our operation for opportunities 
to improve efficiency. Major recent initiatives include 
phasing out less efficient planes and eliminating 
unnecessary weight. The replacement of approximately 
30 percent of the mainline fleet between 2016 and 
2020 will continue to drive improvements. In addition 
to fuel savings initiatives, we continue to implement 
and track operational efficiency on an annual basis. Even small changes, like lowering shades and opening 
vents in the passenger cabin when landing at warm destinations, can reduce cabin temperature by nearly 10 
degrees, minimizing the jet fuel required to cool the 
cabin. Improvements to arrival and departure procedures, onboard weight reduction and other 
measures saved Delta an incremental 9 million gallons 
of fuel in 2016.

Change Agent: 
Carbon Offsets for Carbon-Neutral Growth
 
While the aviation sector has committed to 
carbon-neutral growth after 2020, Delta isn’t waiting on the rest of the industry to start making a difference. 2016 marked the fourth straight year 
of our carbon-neutral growth journey, and carbon 
offsets have played an important role from the start. Offsets help bridge the gap between efficiency improvements and increases in our fuel use. T o address our increase in fuel use, we will purchase 
offsets from a range of carbon offset projects that 
help keep the equivalent of 2.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and maintain carbon-neutral growth relative to 2012 levels.
We chose projects purposefully making sure  
that each project provides both social and 
environmental benefits.
For example, we’re supporting projects in Zimbabwe 
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo aligned with the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest 
Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+). The 
Florestal Santa Maria project, meanwhile, promotes improved forest protection in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil. With the help of the local authorities, Florestal Santa Maria supports the community through reforestation and conservation education. All of our offset purchases have been verified by third parties, which helps ensure their environmental integrity and adherence to industry standards.  
To further increase the transparency of our impacts and offsetting commitments, Delta offers a carbon calculator, accessible at www.delta.com/co2. Customers and other stakeholders can use the calculator to estimate the carbon emissions associated with their trips. Through our partnership with The Nature Conservancy, they can then make financial 
contributions toward offset projects of their choice.
 Delta is proud to lead the aviation industry’s transition to carbon-neutral growth with offsets that lessen our impact — and support developing communities in the process.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Climate Change & Carbon EmissionsDelta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          51related to both fuel costs and environmental concerns. 
Several airlines have begun to experiment with alternative 
jet fuel. 
Although alternative fuels align with the aviation 
industry’s goals to mitigate CO 2 emissions, such fuels 
have only been proven at fractional blends. Alternative 
fuels are still largely unproven as a complete 
replacement for petroleum-based jet fuel with regard 
to scalability in commercial aviation.
IATA Short-T erm Goal: Improved Fuel Efficiency  
G4-EN6  G4-EN7  G4-EN19
IATA measures fuel efficiency as the amount of fuel it 
takes to carry a set amount of revenue weight (passengers or cargo) a certain distance. This calculation is expressed in gallons per 100 revenue ton miles. This measure, in turn, is often converted into emissions per 100 revenue 
ton miles to express emissions intensity. Measuring 
emissions intensity aligns with IATA’s emissions-reduction 
goal and allows airlines to focus on growth. For this 
reason, while our total absolute emissions (direct 
conversion from fuel) may increase, emissions intensity (emissions to transport 100 revenue ton miles) should 
be reduced over time. 
In 2016, Delta’s mainline and regional fuel consumption 
increased by 0.7 percent from 2015 levels, but total load 
transported (measured by gallons per revenue ton mile) 
increased by only 0.6 percent. As a result, Delta’s average annual fuel efficiency improvement from 2009 to 2016 
was 0.8 percent, below the IATA goal of 1.5 percent 
average improvement per year. Based on efficiency per 
available seat mile, Delta improved 1.2 percent in 2016, 
and has improved 5.4 percent since 2009. In 2016, continued fuel efficiencies saved over 9 million 
gallons of fuel, which resulted in reducing total emissions 
by almost 90,000 metric tons. Our progress on fuel savings initiatives is reported monthly to management.
IATA Mid-T erm Goal: Carbon-Neutral Growth
While IATA’s medium-term goal of carbon-neutral 
growth (CNG) from international routes starts in  
2021, Delta has proactively approached, and achieved, 
carbon neutral growth compared to its total 2012 emissions by combining emissions reductions initiatives and purchasing carbon offsets.

We also employ other approaches to reduce our absolute 
emissions. Starting in 2013, we began supplementing 
these approaches by purchasing carbon offsets to reduce 
our footprint to 2012 levels.
T o address total 2015 emissions, we purchased more 
than 2 million offsets from a variety of projects that 
support local Asian and Latin American communities 
where Delta does business. T o address our increase in total 
emissions in 2016 compared to 2012, we will purchase 
2.3 million offsets.
IATA Long-T erm Goal: Absolute Emissions Reduction
Since 2005, Delta has reduced absolute emissions by 
13 percent. T o achieve this goal, we have implemented 
annual fuel savings initiatives to responsibly reduce the environmental impact of our biggest source of 
emissions: jet fuel. Facility Energy Conservation  G4-EN6
In addition to managing fuel consumption, which accounts for nearly 99 percent of Delta’s total carbon 
footprint, Delta is focusing on increasing building 
energy efficiency with the goal of reducing emissions 
from Scope 2 electricity at Delta-owned facilities. 
Due to the age of buildings and the need to approach 
energy mitigation strategies in a cost-effective manner, 
we established a 2016 energy efficiency goal of year-
over-year improvement for the Atlanta headquarters. 
With regard to this goal, additional projects such as 
lighting rewiring and retrofits, additional building 
management system upgrades and variable frequency 
drive installations on air handling units and chillers 
across facilities will help contribute to ongoing efforts. ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Climate Change & Carbon EmissionsDelta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          53CARBON EMISSIONS (Metric T ons CO2e)

*Emissions numbers updated post 2015 CRR publication after GHG verification had been completed.In 2015 and 2016, Delta invested nearly $12 million in 
facility improvements, a majority of which were at our Atlanta headquarters — our largest location. In addition, we allocated $340,000 specifically toward lighting 
efficiency upgrades. T ogether these investments are 
helping to improve the efficiency of our operations, reduce our carbon footprint on the ground and reinforce our commitment to environmental sustainability.
Two major Delta facilities have recently been recognized 
for driving sustainable change. In early 2016, Delta’s 
Atlanta facility received a rebate check from Georgia Power for energy upgrades made in 2014 and 2015, including lighting retrofits, equipment upgrades and reflective roofing improvements. These updates led to electricity savings of more than 8.1 million kilowatt-hours.
At the 2016 Energy Efficiency Expo, Delta accepted an 
Xcelence Award for two Minneapolis facilities that will save more than 3.4 million kilowatt-hours thanks to the replacement of an aging compressed air system and new cooling towers in a data center. The associated reduction 
in carbon emissions is equivalent to driving round-trip 
between Minneapolis and Atlanta 2,500 times.ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT  |  Climate Change & Carbon Emissions

Delta’s First African-American Female Captain
Blazing Trails in the Skies 
Even as a child, Stephanie Johnson dreamed of flying. She got her first taste of life in the air as a high schooler, when a teacher who owned a plane took a group of students for a ride and even let Johnson take the controls. “I will never forget looking out at the horizon and Lake Erie over one wing and the 
city of Cleveland over the other,” says Johnson. “My interest was fueled.”
From there, she studied aviation at Kent State University and became a flight instructor. In 1997, 
Johnson became Northwest Airlines’ first African-American female pilot. Eventually, Johnson earned the rank of captain. She is the first African-American woman at Delta to hold the title. 
What does the honor mean to Johnson? “I feel a great sense of responsibility to be a positive role 
model. There are so few women in this profession and too many women who still don’t think of it as a career option. When I was hired by Northwest Airlines, there were 12 African-American women airline pilots in the country at the major airlines, and I knew all of their names.” 
“T oday is very different, and though there are still people to inform, I am so thankful that the word is 
out. This is a great career. It’s worth the hard work.”
In early 2017, Johnson made history again by leading Delta’s first mainline flight with two African-
American female pilots in the flight deck. She was joined by Atlanta-based First Officer Dawn Cook.

& Labor  G4-DMA  G4-11  G4-HR4
Labor management, in the form of employee policies 
and the responsibility for those policies, falls under Human Resources and is the direct responsibility of Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources 
Officer Joanne Smith. Also under her leadership are 
policies focused on labor management and development, HR service delivery and other HR programs that help to preserve Delta’s unique culture of positive and continuous engagement with its more than 80,000 employees.
We also track employee satisfaction rates as a KPI 
with our annual employee satisfaction survey. In 2016, we established a goal to achieve an 85 percent overall positive engagement score, and at year end survey results showed we had achieved an 89 percent positive engagement rating by Delta employees. 
Delta respects all employees’ legal rights, including the 
rights to free association and collective bargaining. This includes the right to decide whether to be represented by a union. Our U.S.-based employees are covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), the federal law governing labor relations between air carriers and their employees. Under the RLA, employees have the right to decide 
whether they wish to be represented by a union. They 
also have the right to reject union representation. As of December 31, 2016, 19 percent of employee-pilots, dispatchers (Delta and Endeavor), and Endeavor Flight 
Attendants are currently represented by unions and 
covered by collective bargaining agreements. In 2016, the approximate number of Delta employees represented by unions totaled 15,984.DEL TA PEOPLE  |  Employee Relations

Delta manages employment and labor through comprehensive human resource strategies 
and policies that include compensation, benefits, training, performance planning and monitoring, and labor relations programs.
58         Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility ReportManagement Approach to Remuneration  
& Compensation  G4-LA13  G4-52
Executive compensation is dependent on Delta’s 
performance and is aligned with compensation for all employees. The Personnel & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors sets performance evaluation 
criteria and compensation for the CEO and reviews and 
approves compensation for other officers. The committee also produces an annual report on executive compensation 
for inclusion in Delta’s proxy statement, in accordance 
with SEC rules and regulations. 
Achievements of operational and financial performance 
goals are essential to Delta success. These goals drive payouts to employees under the Profit Sharing Program and Shared Rewards Program and are incorporated in Delta’s annual management incentive plan. If no profit sharing is paid to Delta employees, then payouts under the management incentive plan are capped at target 
award levels. This structure provides Delta leaders 
with incentives to deliver value to Delta shareholders, customers and employees, and aligns their interests with those of employees.
Non-executive employees are paid in two ways based 
on their employment type. Scale employees are paid 
an hourly wage, and merit employees are paid salaries.  
Delta’s scale workforce helps drive our business on a 
daily basis. From ramp agents to flight attendants, maintenance technicians, baggage handlers and more across the Delta system, they are key to our success.
Our scale compensation philosophy includes  
five components:
1.  Indus try leadership that is sustainable through economic 
cycles compared to our global competitors — American 
Airlines and United Airlines.2.  P erformance-based variable pay that rewards the 
achievement of excellent operational metrics and financial performance.
3.  P ay premiums that provide additional pay based on 
varying job function.
4.  W ork rules that provide a balance of flexibility, 
productivity and quality of work life.
5.  Bene fits that are competitive and flexible, including 
paid time off, retirement savings and comprehensive 
healthcare coverage.
Delta’s merit employee population is made up of a broad 
mix of leaders and individual contributors. Whether they 
are leading or enabling operational excellence, our merit 
workforce contributes added value to Delta. 
Our merit pay philosophy is focused on a mix of  
three elements:
1.  Job per formance as a mix of skill, experience, 
innovation, effort and leadership.
2.  Mark et competitiveness that allows us to track pay  
in the broader market using data to benchmark 
across industries. 
3.  Int ernal equity that allows us to benchmark jobs 
comparable to both the market and relative  
to Delta “peers.” DEL TA PEOPLE  |  Employee Relations

Reservation Sales Flex @ Home program allows employees to receive the same benefits as Ready Reserve employees without the time and expense of traveling between home and the call center. For our entire workforce, competitive base pay is one piece of a larger compensation pie that includes additional rewards and benefits. T ogether these elements serve as a key piece of what makes Delta  
a great place to work.
Delta is firmly committed to a policy of equal employment 
opportunity. The company prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, creed, age, sex, pregnancy, disability, genetic information, 
marital or familial status, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, citizenship status, veteran status, arrest record, political affiliation, status regarding public assistance and other characteristics that may be protected by law. Delta’s policy of equal employment Change Agent:  
Equal Pay Pledge
Full-time working women at U.S. companies earn about 79 cents for every dollar men earn, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Over a 40-year career, 
this disparity costs women more than $430,000. 
Not so at Delta. In administrative jobs, Delta women earn 98 percent of what men do, and  
there is statistical parity among male and female 
frontline or “scale” employees.
 This number is well above the national average. But 
according to Joanne Smith, Executive Vice President 
and Chief Human Resources Officer at Delta, the company won’t rest until the gap is reduced to zero for all employees. Says Smith, “Our success is built on diversity, where our differences make us stronger and all people are welcomed, supported and — above all — treated equally.”
 We strengthened our commitment in 2016 by 
signing the White House Equal Pay Pledge, which encourages U.S. companies to advance equal pay among men and women. By signing the pledge, we committed to conducting an annual company-wide 
gender pay analysis across occupations; reviewing 
hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers; 
and embedding equal pay efforts into broader 
enterprise-wide equity initiatives.
 “The very nature of our business is bringing people 
together,” Smith explains. “We’re proud to voice our 
commitment to fairness and diversity in the workplace.”
60         Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Reportand non-discrimination applies to every aspect of 
employment, including compensation. All employment decisions, including compensation decisions, are based on legitimate work-related criteria, not on protected 
personal traits or characteristics. 
Rewarding Great Performance  G4-52
Delta has a variety of mechanisms for recognizing our 
employees for superior work. Our profit sharing program is one of the most generous in the industry and recognizes our employees’ achievement in meeting Delta’s financial 
targets for the year. Over the past five years, we have 
paid out nearly $5 billion through the program, more than any other company. Our people can further share in our financial success through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). This plan allows employees to elect payroll deductions to purchase Delta stock. 
Beyond rewards for the company’s financial performance, 
we incentivize employees to deliver safe, best-in-class, 
on-time travel to customers. Through the Shared Rewards Program, eligible employees have an opportunity to earn a monthly cash bonus based on achieving the specific operational goals of baggage handling, completion factor and on-time arrivals. 
The program provides a payout of $25 for meeting  
or exceeding one goal, $75 for two and $100 for all 
three, with a maximum payout of $1,200 per year for U.S.-based employees. Change Agent:  
Delta Employees
Record-Breaking Returns for Unmatched Work Delta achieved historic profits in 2015. Since our people were instrumental to that success, we decided 
to celebrate them in a very big way in early 2016. In 
February, Delta distributed $1.5 billion through our profit sharing program — the largest payout ever 
made by any company, let alone any airline. 
T o take the record-setting a step further, we erected a 
Guinness World Record-breaking, 50-foot-tall greeting 
card at the Delta General Offices, which included the 
names of all 80,000+ Delta employees. We also thanked employees with ad placements in U.S. newspapers, including The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
Delta employees across divisions found memorable 
ways to celebrate the event. Leaders in Salt Lake City dressed up in Star Trek costumes to commemorate 
the company for going “where no one else has gone before.” The Delta airport station at 
Washington Dulles International Airport rolled 
out the red carpet for an Oscars-themed event. 
Individual employees also took to Twitter to express their support using the hashtag #DeltaProud.

Delta SkySpa
A relaxing retreat 
Massages. Manicures. Makeovers. It’s what you’d 
expect to find at a boutique spa — but perhaps 
not inside the world’s busiest airport. That changed with the 2016 grand opening of the SkySpa at the Atlanta airport, joining the first SkySpa location in Salt Lake City. 
Designed with airport customer service and cargo 
agents, flight attendants, pilots, technical operations 
and ground service equipment technicians and 
other employees in mind, Delta’s SkySpa is a place 
where employees can take advantage of much-
deserved relaxation time. 
Services include discounted massages; hair, skin 
and nail care; makeup application, shoe shining 
and uniform alterations — all designed to help employees look and feel their best. Employees also receive discounts on gifts and uniform accessories. 
Inside the SkySpa, Delta employees can also get  
a first look at the new Uniform Fit Line, which will be worn starting in 2018, and receive personal style consultation from Crew Outfitters staff. 
When they’re on the job, our frontline teams are 
always putting our customers and the operation 
first. Giving them a place to recharge the mind, body and spirit allows our people to present the best version of themselves when they step out into the concourse, onboard a plane or onto the tarmac. And it shows our employees that we care 
about creating a great place to work. 
Eligible international employees participate in Shared 
Rewards with target payout values appropriate for 
each country. 
In 2016, the Shared Rewards operational goals were met 
32 times out of a possible 36. Delta employees received 
$1,125 in received Shared Rewards payouts in 2016 
totaling approximately $91.4 million in Shared Rewards.
People who exceed expectations may be recognized 
with membership in Delta’s Chairman’s Club, which annually recognizes employees, excluding officers and directors, who consistently demonstrate the highest standards of service to customers, coworkers and the 
communities Delta serves. Honorees are nominated by 
colleagues and are recognized at a gala hosted by 
senior Delta leaders in Atlanta each fall. Along with 
recognition at the gala, honorees’ names are displayed on a Delta aircraft for one year, and honorees receive 
two confirmed travel tickets to anywhere Delta flies. 
In 2016, the 20th year of the program, more than 
10,000 nominations were received for 100 honorees to be recognized. Honorees represented 28 Delta stations in seven countries. Their combined total was 2,174 years of service, with 22 years per honoree on average.

training and general professional development. Each 
year, merit employees participate in a performance management process to ensure that activities and outputs are connected to and support Delta’s goals and Rules of the Road. In addition, employees have various opportunities to increase their business knowledge, skills and abilities. Delta has developed an online learning database that allows employees access to a broad range of courses  
at their convenience. Employees are also supported informally with on-the-job training, coaching, mentoring and performance support as needed.

Delta 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report          63This review process allows employees to receive 
feedback about their performance throughout the

three phases:

objectives aligned with the goals of their manager, division and the overall corporation. Performance plans 
address both performance objectives and Delta’s High 
Performance Attributes (HPAs), demonstrated to 
support performance objectives. >  M id-Year Review — Each employee has an opportunity 
to discuss progress on performance objectives and 
HPAs made over the previous six months. 
>  Y ear-End Review — Individual performance is evaluated 
against the results delivered for each objective and 
demonstration of Delta’s HPAs. Each of these components

The pursuit of an advanced degree can be a

their donations to the Delta Scholarship Fund. 
The Fund has awarded more than $4 million in 
scholarships to employees and their eligible family members since it launched in 2008, with more than $1 million distributed in 2016 alone. The program is 
truly by employees, for employees, as it is primarily 
supported by donations from our people. 
More than 600 Delta employees and dependents 
received funding for the 2016–2017 academic year, including Ontario-based Ready Reserve agent Dimitra P ., who was honored with the 
$10,000 C.E. Woolman Leadership Award to 
pursue her MBA. The board also awarded scholarships to 24 international winners, the highest number of international scholarships

safety procedures either meet or exceed the best 
safety practices of the airline industry. In most cases, our 
proactive safety culture allows us to exceed regulatory 
standards. This culture is a result of our commitments to strong compliance practice, internal audits, a cooperative 
relationship with regulatory agencies, and a positive 
relationship with employees. 
Delta’s OSHA recordable occupational injury/illness rate 
for 2016 increased slightly compared to 2015. Our safety record continues to be significantly stronger than the industry average in comparison with the most recent 
2015 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) numbers. Delta’s 
OSHA rate is 48.2 percent better than the BLS industry 
average, and the Days Away Restricted Transferred (DART) rate is 49.3 percent better than the industry average. 
There were no work-related fatalities during 2016.
Delta is the only major airline recognized with OSHA’s 
Corporate Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) status. Delta has 20 VPP Star locations in the U.S. VPP is not an award, but an acknowledgment of success and commitment 
to continuously improving our employees’ safety at work. 
Today, less than 1 percent of more than 10 million U.S. worksites share this distinction. At Delta’s 20 VPP Star sites, the rate of on-the-job injury 
and illness is far lower than the industry. Delta’s 1.61 per 
100 employee on-the-job injury rate at VPP locations is a 
fraction of the scheduled air transportation industry rate of 
6.8. Additionally, at our VPP facilities the OSHA recordable rate was 56.9 percent better than non-VPP Delta sites 
and 76.3 percent better than the industry average.
Safety Engagement  G4-LA6  G4-LA8
Our safety policies are comprehensive, but it’s our 
employees who carry those policies out and bring our 
safety culture to life. An important way we improve 
safety at individual facilities is through an annual 
Safety Business Plan, prepared by every Delta facility 
system-wide. These plans are used for incident 
prevention, regulatory compliance, and divisional business and operational planning purposes. Plans  
are compliant with key elements of OSHA’s VPP . 
A Safety Business Plan describes how an individual 
operation will plan, organize, communicate, implement, measure and enforce a local workplace safety process. It includes all elements of an occupational safety 
management system, including an overview of 
management leadership and employee involvement,  
a worksite analysis, a hazard prevention and control DEL TA PEOPLE  |  Employee Health, Safety & Security

Business Plan also assigns ownership to action items, 
and provides a schedule to allow for measurement and 
completion of items with a required quarterly review. 
To validate compliance, Delta conducts annual Safety 
and Health Gap Assessments with a third party at 
strategic locations to provide us with an unbiased view 
of our safety efforts. The assessments identify gaps 
between OSHA regulations and Delta policies, which we then address to ensure a safe working environment for our employees. In addition, we conduct our own onsite visits, review required documentation and 
interview employees to help ensure that the Delta 
safety culture is present at all locations. 
Delta celebrates National Safety Month each June, during 
which employees receive weekly safety and health information related to specific focus areas. Facilities 
across the system hold safety and health fairs, the largest 
of which is in Atlanta at our Technical Operations Center. In 2016, the Atlanta fair hosted vendors who provided information, products and demonstrations designed to 
help employees at work, home or play.
Health Benefits  G4-LA2
In addition to comprehensive healthcare coverage, 
Delta offers dental, vision and flexible spending account 
benefits to eligible employees. To promote disease 
prevention, employees enrolled in a Delta Account-Based 
Healthcare Plan are covered at 100 percent for preventive care services based on the recommendations of the 
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Beyond 
USPSTF recommendations, employees covered by Delta’s 
medical plans receive other preventive services such as 
travel immunizations and assistance with healthcare 
questions and needs through the Delta Health Direct 
program. In addition, employees and their eligible family members have access to Delta’s Employee Assistance Program, which offers confidential counseling, assessment and referral service support.
As of January 2017 , U.S.-based expectant mothers in all 
ground and flight attendant positions, including Ready 
Reserve and Flex @ Home, receive a minimum six weeks 
of 100 percent pay for maternity leave. In addition, all 
mothers and fathers may take a 30-day unpaid bonding 
leave following the birth, adoption, guardianship or 
fostering of a child once paid maternity leave (if applicable) and/or other Family Medical Leave Act benefits have been exhausted.
Through Delta Health Rewards, a voluntary, incentive-
based wellness program, we help U.S. employees and their spouses or same-sex domestic partners reach health goals. Participants earn Rewards dollars by 
completing specific health actions such as undergoing 
an annual physical exam, completing an online health assessment and refraining from the use of tobacco 
products. Rewards dollars are put into employee health 
reimbursement accounts (HRAs) or Optum Bank health 
savings accounts (HSAs) each year and can be used to

Travel and Work Health 
To continually ensure the health of all Delta employees, 
numerous employee medical surveillance programs, screenings and safety trainings were conducted at Delta airport stations in 2016. Programs included:

Regulation pertaining to Lifetime Yellow Fever vaccination status while maintaining optional 10-year revaccination benefit at the employee’s option.

>  L eading the placement of a CPR automated training 
kiosk at Gate A11 of Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Its aim is to engage and educate passengers on CPR techniques in less than 15 minutes.
Our employees travel to all parts of the world, which can occasionally expose them to disease outbreaks  
and other health risks. To address these challenges, Delta provides its employees on business travel with travel health consultation and company-paid vaccine coverage, anti-malaria medication and insect repellent. 
In 2016, we implemented a new WHO International 
Health Regulation pertaining to lifetime yellow fever vaccination status while maintaining an optional 
10-year revaccination benefit at the employee’s option.

target prevention of illness among employees who 
travel internationally on company business, especially 
to developing countries with risks of malaria, yellow 
fever, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, food/waterborne illness and other diseases that may occur as outbreaks. Employee education focuses on promoting awareness about the use of personal protection measures, early 
symptom recognition, a 24/7 malaria hotline and 
prompt medical treatment. 
Delta also provides top-tier global medical assistance  
to help employees who become ill or injured while  
on company business internationally. Telephone 
consultations, available 24/7 , can result in a hotel 
physician visit, a doctor’s office appointment or referral to an emergency room. Case management 
continues until the ill employee can travel back home.

Junior Achievement Partnership
Preparing Youth for Success
Global nonprofit Junior Achievement (JA) exposes young people to transformative experiences that open minds and jump-start careers. That could mean learning from professionals in business, finance or economics — or climbing inside the cockpit of an airplane. 
Through an expanded partnership with Junior Achievement Americas, Delta will help students do that 
and more. Delta now sponsors the JA Job Shadow Program in Argentina, Chile and Mexico to teach youth about Delta and the airline industry as a whole. Classroom sessions prepare students for a visit to a professional work environment and teach them how to research career opportunities and the skills needed to land and keep their dream jobs. Onsite job shadowing at various airports gives students a 
behind-the-scenes look at how an airline is run and the people behind the operation.
In 2015, Delta began supporting the JA Company of the Year Competition, an entrepreneurial contest 
and celebration for high school students who participate in the JA Company Program. 
During the 2016 competition, Delta granted the first-ever Delta Social Impact Award to the student-run 
company that scored highest on measures of advancing global diversity, improving global wellness, 
supporting education and sustaining the environment. The winner was Ilumin-Arte, an organization 
that recycles and repurposes items, donating the proceeds to Guatemalan families in need.
Delta is a longtime supporter of JA, partnering with 23 chapters worldwide through Delta Air Lines and  
10 chapters through the Delta Air Lines Foundation. Our founder, C.E. Woolman, and other Delta leaders 
have served on various chapters’ Boards of Directors.
Delta aims to become the best U.S. airline in Latin America and the Caribbean and prepare youth 
for successful careers. By building relationships through our work with Junior Achievement, we’re accomplishing both goals.

We understand that today’s graduates need diverse skill sets to be competitive in today’s marketplace. That’s why The Delta Air Lines 
Foundation made a $2 million gift to Georgia 
State University’s J. Mack Robinson College of Business. The contribution will fund the creation of the Delta Student Success Center, a space that will help students develop business communication skills, gain experiential learning opportunities 
and connect with businesses for internships and 
job opportunities. Many of Delta’s employees graduated from GSU.

ASPECT: ENVIRONMENTAL GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS
G4-DMA Generic Disclosures on Management Approach As a global airline leader, Delta understands the global environmental 
impacts of our business operations. Because of this realization, we 
strive to mitigate all environmental impacts of our operations.
For purposes of this report, Delta defines grievances for impacts on 
society as grievances related to our environmental material aspects 
including: Energy, Emissions, Fuel, Waste and Compliance.
Delta does not manufacture, process or distribute products or  
raw materials. For this reason Delta is not at risk for any product-
related grievances.
Delta does recognize that operations do produce significant impacts 
related to carbon emissions. For this reason we present data related 
to climate change and emissions strategies associated with avoiding and reducing emissions.
The airline industry is highly regulated, and Delta adheres to all 
applicable local, state and national laws and regulations. In addition, 
we have procedures in place to support compliance and address 
environmental incidents. We also audit compliance efforts and are subject to inspections by relevant authorities.
External stakeholders can voice grievances through Delta’s Safety, 
Ethics & Compliance HelpLine (800-253-7879).

organizati on	that	assists 	organizations	i n	measuring, 	
reporting ,	and	verifying 	the	carbon 	emissions 	from 	
their	operations 	in	order	 to	manage 	and	reduce 	
emissions .	This	verification	 was	conducted 	by	SCS	in	
accordanc e	with 	the	ISO	14064- 3	standard 	and	
requirements 	unde r	TCR’s	GHG	reporting 	program .		
SCS	has	 verified 	Delta’s 	annual	G HG	inventory 	for	
every	 emission	 year	 since	the	baseline	year	 2005.	 In	
2016	SCS	 verified 	Delta’s 	EY	2015	 GHG	 inventory	–	
the	data	 and	information	 under	review 	were 	
historical 	in	nature 	as	reporting 	and	verification 	
occur 	for	the	 previous	 year’ s	emissions.		
Roles	and	Responsibilities	
Delta’s	 internal	 team	 was	responsible 	for	managing	
their	GHG	 information 	system,	 including 	developing	
and	maintaining	records 	and	 reporting	 procedures,	
and	m easuring,	calculating,	and	 reporting	the	 total	
GHG	 emissions.	
SCS	was 	responsible 	for	the	independent 	verification 	
of	Delta’s 	informati on	system, 	including	 ensuring	
compliance	 with	 TCR’s	GHG	 reporting	 program	 and	
the	accurate	measurement	 of	their	 entity-w ide	GHG	
emiss ions	for	emission	y ear	( EY)	2 015.	 This	 review	
focused	 on	the	completeness	o f	Delta’s	 GHG		inventory	and	the	accuracy	of	its	calculations.	The	
verification	team	also	reviewed	the	data	
management	 system,	the	organizational	boundary	
delineation,	and	relevant	supporting	documentation	
provided	by	Delta.	 SCS	produced	a	verification	
opinion	to	express	their	findings	from	the	
verification. 	
Objectives 	
The	objective	of	this	verification	was	to	e valuate	
whe ther	Delta	has	a	GHG	emissions	reporting	
program	consistent	with	 TCR’ s	Ge neral	Reporting	
Protocol	(GRP)	and	to	e valuate	the	reasonableness	
of	the	data	submitted	to	TCR	for	 EY	2015 	against	the	
verification	criteria.
