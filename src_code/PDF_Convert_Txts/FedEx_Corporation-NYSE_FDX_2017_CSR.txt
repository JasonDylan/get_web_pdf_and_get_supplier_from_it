In FY17, we exceeded $60 billion in revenues for the first 
time. This financial milestone represented a $9.9 billion increase and a 20 percent growth rate over FY16. We also 
saw 3.8 percent growth in average daily package volumes 
for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground in FY17 as well as a 2.8 percent increase in average daily less-than-truckload shipments for FedEx Freight.
The continued integration of TNT Express (TNT), a 
strategic acquisition in late FY16, strengthened the organization even further in FY17 as we incorporated  their expertise and reach into the FedEx enterprise  
for the benefit of our customers and our business.Our CompanyAwards and Recognition

Chairman and CEOChairman’s Letter
The FedEx multiplier effect: How we deliver more opportunities for everyone
“Going viral” is a common phrase today — describing the 
phenomenon of a photo, tweet, or link swelling through the internet with great speed and huge viewership.
Perhaps FedEx was one of the first companies to go viral. 
We established such a fast and broad network — both physical and digital — that we have multiplied the benefits of our size and scale for individuals and organizations 
around the world. In fact, today we connect 99 percent  
of the global GDP. 
Our strong financial performance over the past few years 
gives us the resources to make sure the FedEx “multiplier 
effect” continues to expand the horizons of businesses, 
communities, and the environment.
Multiplying growth for business and society
We stand at the nexus of world trade and support its ability to create jobs and foster prosperity for countries and cultures everywhere. After all, 95 percent of 
consumers live outside the U.S., and we serve virtually 
all of them.
We firmly support global trade and consider all our more 
than 425,000 FedEx jobs to be trade jobs. We know how 
important trade is to businesses small and large. For 
example, a small business called Nurdle in the Rough transforms ocean plastic pollution into beautiful jewelry. It relies on FedEx to deliver the items to customers 
worldwide and broaden the company’s participation 
in global trade, all while providing a social good. Small businesses grow when they connect to the world.
As e-commerce continues to expand around the world, 
FedEx collaborates with retailers such as Walgreens in the 
U.S. and 7-Eleven in Asia to make it easier for customers to pick up and ship packages. In America, 80 percent of citizens live within five miles of FedEx hold locations such as grocery and drug stores as well as FedEx Express and FedEx Office facilities. We continue to explore new delivery models, technologies, aircraft, and vehicles to better serve customers’ needs as they travel the world’s  physical and digital pathways.
As long-time navigators of urban landscapes everywhere, 
we are working with the World Resources Institute to share our transportation expertise with major cities in Brazil and India on such topics as bus electrification and 
route optimization that get people to school and jobs with 
greater efficiency, less environmental impact,  and increased safety. 
Of course, in our mission to connect people and 
possibilities, we believe in contributing resources directly. 
In fiscal year 2016 we committed to giving $200 million to 200 communities by 2020 as part of our FedEx Cares global giving initiative. As of the end of FY17 we have 
made great progress: $101.66 million in cash grants 
to a total of 134 communities. We’re well on our way to achieving our goal. 
We also faced one of the most challenging years in our 
history in terms of natural disasters. With four major 
incidents in the span of one month in 2017, FedEx pledged $3 million in cash and transportation to victims  of hurricanes and earthquakes, delivering water treatment systems, blankets, clean-up kits and other supplies.  
In addition, our charitable shipping program donated space 
for more than 4.5 million pounds of goods, totaling 79,000 shipments. 
Multiplying efficiency efforts
Transportation fuel represents 92 percent of our emissions footprint, and with our Reduce, Replace and Revolutionize approach, we constantly seek new ways 
to maximize efficiencies, minimize impacts, and foster 
innovative solutions. Our strong financial performance 
over the past few years gives  us the resources to make sure the FedEx ‘multiplier effect’ continues to expand the horizons of businesses, communities,  the environment, and people.
2018 FedEx Global Citizenship Report

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexChairman’s Letter
Efficiency efforts at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight 
saved more than 44.5 million gallons of vehicle fuel, and  avoided more than 457,000 metric tons of CO
2e  
emissions in FY17. 
On the jet fuel side, in FY17 our aircraft fleet 
modernization and FedEx® Fuel Sense programs saved 
177.3 million gallons of fuel and avoided more than 1.7 million metric tons of CO
2e emissions, over 16 percent 
more emissions avoided than the previous fiscal year.
We’re continuing our investments in sustainable energy:
• We’re adding electric vehicles to our fleet and had more 
than 2,860 alternative-fuel, electric, and hybrid-electric 
vehicles by the end of FY17. 
• Across various FedEx operating companies, we’re using hydrogen fuel cells and biodiesel where we can, and are always looking for additional alternative fuel types  to become more efficient and sustainable. 
• We added two more on-site solar-energy systems at FedEx Ground facilities last fiscal year, bringing our company-wide total to 20.
• FedEx Freight has reserved 20 Tesla Semi trucks which, when produced, could deliver a better experience  
to truck drivers while increasing safety and reducing  
cargo-transport costs. 
Multiplying people potential
Every day, our more than 425,000 team members around the world are committed to delivering our Purple Promise to customers — to make every FedEx experience 
outstanding. Their dedication has made us one of the 
most admired companies in the world. For that we  thank them! To multiply the potential of our team members,  we provide training, career development, and innovative 
benefits as well as a diverse, inclusive, and safe 
workplace. At the end of FY17, team members could choose among 21,000 online courses through the  FedEx Learning Center, and throughout the year they  each participated in an average of almost 20 hours  
of formal training. 
In the past fiscal year, we also began changing our 
performance management system to a coaching-based approach. It provides ongoing manager input and 
improves the team member experience.
Because we value the diverse backgrounds and 
perspectives of our team members, we have established internal programs and best-in-class external programs to 
recruit, develop, retain, and nurture a diverse workforce. 
Among our efforts are diversity and inclusion training to new employees and to managers. FedEx also sponsors  a companywide Diversity and Inclusion Corporate Council 
to strengthen the roots of diversity within FedEx. 
Of course, we also multiply possibilities for people beyond 
FedEx, especially those seeking employment. We’ve contributed $4.4 million to programs that provide avenues 
to employment to disadvantaged youth since FY16.  
More than 100,000 young people have enjoyed training  or connections to job opportunities through our FedEx Cares Employment Pathways programs. 
Safety is another way we multiply benefits for our 
communities, customers, and team members. Since  it’s a core value for us, we prioritize safety on the roads,  in the air, in our facilities, and in the communities we serve. For example, we achieved nearly 13 percent 
improvement in our preventable, recordable vehicle-
accident rate in FY17. And through our work with SafeKids Worldwide,  in FY17, we:
• Invested more than $3 million in road safety 
initiatives and committed $10 million over four years 
to the organization; 
• Provided safety expertise and hands-on support delivered by nearly 1,200 team members to more  
than 1 million children in 711 cities around the globe.
Overlaying all of these efforts is our commitment to maintaining the highest ethical and professional standards. 
Proper business conduct encourages loyalty among 
team members, suppliers, and customers and fosters a rewarding relationship between FedEx and communities where we operate.
Connecting is what we do at FedEx, and we make 
connections happen reliably, millions of times a day.  The more connections we generate, the more options  we multiply for individuals and businesses everywhere  —  so people see the world not within the confines of  
a narrow geography but as an ever-growing universe  
of opportunities. We believe this report opens a window  to that universe.

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexOur CSR Approach
In an increasingly fast-paced and interdependent world, 
connecting people with goods, services, ideas and technologies creates opportunities. Across more than 
220 countries and territories, FedEx is making these 
connections, which in turn generates jobs, fosters economic prosperity and lifts communities to higher standards of living. 
Our global corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
approach supports these opportunities and redefines how the world is connected for the benefit of economies, the environment and people.
Corporate Social Responsibility  
Strategy and Implementation
We set enterprise-level strategies to deliver our global 
CSR goals and commitments, and each operating company reports on a core set of metrics. Though  
many FedEx CSR programs and policies are designed  
for, and implemented at, the operating company level,  our shared purpose unites and guides these efforts.
We prioritize our material environmental and social  
issues as well as the areas where we can use our  
most valuable assets — our global transportation networks, logistics expertise and the passion of  our team members — to reduce risks and provide  
the greatest possible benefits to society.Our Corporate Social Responsibility Focus Areas
Economy
By connecting businesses and 
communities through a growing portfolio of services and tools,  
we enable economic growth  
and make it easier for customers to access new markets, thereby helping to raise standards of 
living. And, as one of the  
world’s most admired brands,  we strive to serve as a role model in the communities we serve  by providing economic 
opportunities to small businesses 
and people in need.Environment
By using our global assets, expertise in efficiency and commitment to innovation, 
we work to minimize our 
environmental footprint, find innovative solutions and improve quality of life. Throughout the 
FedEx organization, our Reduce, 
Replace, Revolutionize approach permeates our sustainability efforts, with our Environmental Policy guiding the operating 
companies in managing 
environmental performance.People
By engaging and empowering our 425,000-plus team members and providing them with safe, 
inclusive workplaces and 
continued career development, they have opportunities to thrive and to help us make every 
FedEx experience outstanding. 
Each FedEx operating company provides programs and resources to best meet the needs of their team members, while maintaining 
a shared culture, an emphasis on 
quality-driven management and an enduring commitment to the Purple Promise.

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexOur first CSR materiality assessment was completed  
in 2014; see the materiality matrix on page 8 in our  2014 report  for the full list of material issues. In FY16,  
we sought additional input from our external stakeholders through a survey and roundtable engagement session with industry groups, customers, investors, sustainability experts, nonprofits and government agencies. Engaging 
with these external stakeholders, as well as with our  
team members, to identify the key issues that affect  our business enables us to manage associated risks,  as well as capitalize on potential opportunities.
This feedback process confirmed that emissions from  
our transportation fleet and operations are still among  our greatest areas of impact. We plan to conduct  another materiality analysis in 2018 and use the results  to continue evolving our CSR focus areas, risks, goals  
and approaches. We also plan to evaluate the relevance  
of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals  and their potential role in shaping our future CSR and business strategies.
Across our operations, we plan for the short- and long-
term to mitigate potential negative impacts on revenue, costs, reputation and business continuity. The FedEx Board of Directors and its committees oversee the 
company’s risk management activities, with management 
having day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing risk exposure. For information about these responsibilities, please see our 2017 Proxy Statement .

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexLong named one of the world’s most admired companies, 
FedEx maintains a culture of integrity that reflects our commitment to the highest ethical and professional 
standards. Our enduring focus on ethical behavior, safety 
and customer satisfaction — which are embedded in our corporate mission statement — is supported by strong oversight, policies and procedures.
Board of Directors
The FedEx Board of Directors oversees our global operations. Led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederick W. Smith, the Board is composed of thirteen 
members, including twelve who are independent, four 
who are women and two who are minorities. Independent directors chair our four standing committees:
• Audit Committee
• Compensation Committee
• Information Technology Oversight Committee
• Nominating & Governance Committee
For more information on the Board’s roles and 
responsibilities, see our Investor Relations  website.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics , the foundation 
of our corporate integrity and compliance program,  is introduced by our Chairman, Frederick W. Smith.  
In his introduction, Mr. Smith reminds employees 
that “adhering to the highest ethical and professional standards is an important part of delivering our Purple Promise to make every FedEx experience outstanding. 
Integrity is the key to our culture and our future success.”
The Code of Conduct sets a high standard for team 
member conduct worldwide. New hires are trained on its provisions, which cover, among other things, workplace 
health, safety and environment, human rights, money Governance
laundering prevention, harassment and discrimination, 
conflicts of interest and gifts and entertainment. The Code is now available in 33 languages, and additional 
translations of both the Code and related policies and 
procedures are under way to make them even more accessible to our global network of team members.
Corporate Integrity and  
Compliance Department
Each FedEx operating company operates within a unique 
set of regulatory environments and maintains compliance with regional and sector-specific requirements. 
Globally, the FedEx Corporate Integrity and Compliance 
Department serves as a central resource to further embed the FedEx commitment to integrity in everything we do. The Department, led by our Global Chief Compliance  
& Governance Officer, provides best practices, tools  
and guidance to serve the global compliance needs  of the business.
FedEx encourages employees to report any potential 
legal or ethical violation to management, legal, human 
resources or the 24-hour FedEx Alert Line service managed by the Corporate Integrity and Compliance Department. In communications and training, employees are regularly reminded of the importance of speaking up.
Anti-Corruption Policies
Everywhere we operate, FedEx is committed to complying with all anti-corruption laws and prohibits bribes of any type. Our Global Anti-Corruption Policy 
and related Anti-Corruption Compliance Procedures 
provide detailed guidance to team members. Training at the time of onboarding and again within three years is required for team members in relevant roles. This includes 
management in international operations as well as team 
members and suppliers who interact with government officials, such as customs and border personnel, on behalf of FedEx. Our third-party oversight program includes due diligence, annual certifications of compliance, training and 
other practices to mitigate risks.
Ethics, Integrity and  
Anti-Corruption Training
Live and online training on the Code of Conduct, anti-
corruption, antitrust, conflicts of interest and other compliance areas are key components of our corporate 
integrity and compliance program. Ensuring our 
compliance program is embedded in a newly acquired company is also a key focus. For example, FedEx provided face-to-face compliance training for nearly 10,000 TNT 
employees across 35 countries during FY17. Additionally, 
more than 12,000 TNT employees were enrolled in online compliance training during that same time period.
Combating Trafficking
FedEx shares the zero tolerance policies adopted by the U.S. and other governments to combat slavery or the trafficking of persons for any purpose. We prohibit 
trafficking-related activities and expect the same of our 
suppliers and contractors. In addition, FedEx Freight has joined Truckers Against Trafficking, an organization that trains drivers to identify potential signs of human 
trafficking. See the FedEx Policy Combating Trafficking 
in Persons for more about our commitment on this issue.

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexData Security and Privacy
Protecting the privacy of our customers, vendors and 
team members is critical to our ability to maintain their trust. We take precautions to safeguard all sensitive 
information and ensure a safe and secure online 
environment, including customer transactions.  Our Customer Protection Center  highlights our  
Privacy Policy  alongside resources to help customers 
identify, report and mitigate risks. For more information, please see our 2017 Form 10-K .
Business Preparedness,  
Resiliency and Disaster Response
As a leading global logistics company, we encounter 
challenging situations, ranging from natural disasters to social unrest, in the course of doing business. Preparing 
for these events is critical to sustaining our global 
operations and minimizing impact on customers.  We proactively establish contingency plans that focus  on restoring service to customers with the least impact  
as possible, while ensuring team member safety —  
our top priority.
To support our internal process, FedEx participates in 
State Emergency Operations Centers programs, as well as 
the FEMA-Northern Command Public-Private-Partnership 
program, which brings private sector companies like FedEx together with national, state and local emergency management organizations to work collaboratively before, during and after disasters. Our active participation in  
these initiatives helps FedEx gain the earliest possible  
re-entry to affected areas, so we can continue to serve  our customers while keeping our team members safe.Global Corporate Social  
Responsibility Governance
The FedEx Enterprise Sustainability Council (FESC) is 
responsible for setting and implementing our company-wide sustainability strategy and administering our CSR 
materiality assessment. Our Chief Sustainability Officer, 
Mitch Jackson, chairs the FESC. This role also oversees the company-wide implementation of our environmental management system and reviews performance annually.
Our global CSR governance also encompasses a variety 
of functions and departments dedicated to our people. Human Resources (HR) departments in each FedEx operating company manage HR priorities, including team 
member career development, engagement and health 
and wellness. The Corporate HR department coordinates efforts across operating companies and manages executive development, team member benefits  and diversity strategy.
In addition, the Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Council 
includes members across operating companies who coordinate company-wide D&I initiatives. When it comes to safety, each FedEx operating company sets workplace 
goals and implements the Safety Above All philosophy 
through policies and programs that are relevant to their specific operations.

development, D&I and safety, see the People  chapter

robust and growing business as we serve our customers and communities. This means leveraging innovative 
and customer-focused efficiency, collaborating with 
diverse suppliers in an evolving supply chain, enabling entrepreneurship and building better communities  through giving and hands-on support. Collectively,  
this approach enables people to thrive, communities  
to flourish and our business to grow.
Business Performance
The continued and significant growth of e-commerce, along with the need for faster and more efficient supply chains, all shaped our business strategy in FY17. During 
the fiscal year, FedEx revenues exceeded $60 billion for 
the first time. This represents a 20 percent growth rate over FY16. And more than $6.4 billion of that revenue came from customers who wanted to know more about 
the emissions generated from shipping their goods.
Growing our business responsibly, resourcefully, 
efficiently and in a forward-thinking manner not only drives the long-term success of our company, but also 
benefits our team members and our millions of other 
stakeholders. Through the positive impacts of our financial performance, FedEx creates income and opportunities for customers, team members, shareowners and suppliers, while creating societal value for communities across more 
than 220 countries and territories. For more about how 
our investments are multiplying opportunities for FedEx team members, see People .Financial Highlights

Efficiency
Operating efficiently benefits the company, our 
stakeholders and the environment in many ways.  We achieve greater fuel efficiency, reduce emissions 
and lower costs through programs such as aircraft fleet 
modernization, vehicle upgrades, innovative technologies and alternative fuel initiatives. Over the years, we have also implemented numerous efficiencies through  
FedEx
® Fuel Sense, our far-reaching program to identify 
and implement fuel saving ideas in our aviation operations.
Aircraft and vehicle fuel usage make up 92 percent of our 
emissions footprint and 5 percent of operating expenses, so fuel efficiency measures deliver value. During FY17,  our FedEx Express vehicle fuel efficiency increased by 37.9 percent over our 2005 baseline. This includes  
a 2.9 percentage point improvement since FY16.  
Our aircraft fleet modernization and FedEx Fuel Sense programs saved $285.5 million and avoided more than 1.7 million metric tons of CO
2e emissions.
Efficiency measures and upgrades throughout our 
operations during FY17 saved more than 32,600 terajoules 
of energy and avoided more than 2.3 million metric tons  of CO
2e emissions. This is equivalent to the emissions 
from more than half a million passenger cars in one year.
In FY17 we avoided more

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexCustomer-Focused Collaboration
Record-breaking growth in e-commerce continues to 
shift the logistics landscape. With double digit increases in online shopping each year, the number of packages 
being shipped as well as the number of delivery points 
have reached new heights. At the same time, customers are looking for more flexibility in handling their shipping needs. To address these parallel challenges while 
delivering the exceptional service our customers have 
trusted for 45 years, we are evolving our business  model. This includes reevaluating traditional approaches  to package drop-off and pickup and finding innovative ways to reduce the impacts of last-mile delivery.  
For instance, we are implementing more opportunities 
for self-service by growing FedEx retail locations and collaborating with third-party retailers to provide even more customer convenience.
• Greater convenience
• Better security
• Decreased miles driven
• Fewer emissions
• Reduced road congestion
• Less noise
• Lower operating costs
Saving Fuel, Lowering Emissions
Eliminating just the “last mile driven” — the difference 
between delivering packages to multiple addresses compared to a central location — could help us 
avoid emissions by more than 18,000 metric tons of 
CO
2e emissions each year. This is equivalent to the 
emissions generated by more than 3,800 passenger cars driven for a year. For more ways we are boosting 
efficiency and reducing impacts, see Environment .Multiple Stores, Multiple Benefits
A new alliance between FedEx and Walgreens, one of the 
largest drugstore chains in the U.S., is just one example of how we are expanding our network of shipping locations, 
strengthening our customer connections, and leveraging 
our collaborations. The alliance also streamlines our last-mile delivery capabilities, which in turn improves environmental efficiency.
Where, When, How Customers 
Want Deliveries
Our collaboration with Walgreens offers customers a 
staffed, secure, personalized shipping option at 7,600 Walgreens locations in all 50 states. And since many 
Walgreens stores have extended hours and are open  
on holidays, customers have even more flexibility in deciding when and where they drop off and pick up  their FedEx Ground and FedEx Express packages.

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexThere’s More than One Place  
to Ship a Package
Our Walgreens alliance is the latest option in our continued 
expansion of FedEx OnSite, a network of retail sites offering FedEx pickup and drop-off services. In addition 
to Walgreens, U.S. customers can find FedEx OnSite in 
more than 600 Kroger and Albertsons grocery stores and can redirect packages to a FedEx OnSite location or other FedEx Hold at Location, including approximately 1,900 
FedEx Office locations. Expanding upon the network of 
retail collaborations, 500 new FedEx Office locations are 
planned to open within Walmart stores in the U.S . 
Expanding in Asia
Our global retail service network has also expanded in Asia, where FedEx Express and 7-Eleven, the largest convenience store chain in Hong Kong and Taiwan, have 
teamed up to offer even more 24/7 shipping options, 
including FedEx iShip drop-off service at 7-Eleven stores in Taiwan, and package self-collection at more than 5,000 7-Eleven stores across Hong Kong and Taiwan. Additionally, 
FedEx Self-Service Lockers at 70 Hong Kong locations 
provide more customer choice in package pickup. Consumers can take advantage of these secure delivery locations by using FedEx Delivery Manager

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexReverse Logistics and the Circular Economy
Almost one-third of e-commerce purchases are returned, 
and handling reverse logistics efficiently to minimize environmental impacts is important to our customers — 
and to FedEx. Similarly, as a product reaches the end of its 
intended life cycle, it should also be handled responsibly. The emerging circular economy aims to keep products, components, and materials at their highest utility  
and value at all times through regeneration or reuse.  
This increasingly means closing the manufacturing,  use and disposal loop by repairing or refurbishing  items for reuse and keeping waste out of landfills.
Maximizing Value from Returns
As an industry leader in reverse logistics, FedEx Supply Chain transforms the returns process from a necessary cost of doing business into a strategic advantage.  
Our reverse logistics operations serve as a conduit for 
customers focusing on the circular economy. This is most evident in our operations that serve the technology and retail sectors, where goods can be refurbished for resale, 
disassembled for key parts and components, or recycled. 
Not only do these services avoid landfill disposal,  they also maximize value from returned products  for our customers and contribute to their sustainability progress as well.
Life Cycle Approach
By leveraging the vast FedEx transportation networks, we bundle shipping with reverse logistics services to provide customers with a holistic solution for handling products 
throughout their life cycle. Our growing retail convenience 
network, which includes grocery stores and pharmacies, as well as thousands of FedEx Hold at Location sites, positions us to play a key role not only in reverse logistics, 
but in the circular economy by making it even easier for 
customers to ship returns and businesses to restore or reuse returned products. Consumer returns can now be processed at FedEx Office, where returned items are consolidated and sent to FedEx Supply Chain  for processing and delivery to the vendor. This not only adds convenience for customers who want to return a product, but it also eliminates unnecessary packaging  
and increases efficiency in handling and transportation.
Environmental Benefits
At several FedEx Supply Chain facilities serving the 
technology industry we receive returns, perform diagnostics and identify the proper disposition for the 
return, which could include refurbishment, return to 
vendor or recycling. Several operations also leverage ISO 14001 certification to drive the best environmental management practices throughout the facility.Global Expansion
Making the shift to a circular economy is not without its challenges. Recruiting and retaining tech-focused talent in a competitive job market and achieving outstanding cost 
efficiency to meet customer expectations requires a well-
defined strategy. The FedEx Quality Driven Management methodology, combined with our strong focus on the customer and our reverse logistics expertise, position 
FedEx Supply Chain for growth. Going forward, the 
realignment of FedEx Supply Chain as part of FedEx  Trade Networks also provides the roadmap to expanding reverse logistics services in markets around the world.

Shanghai Express and Cargo Hub
The new FedEx Shanghai International Express and Cargo 
Hub located at Shanghai Pudong International Airport provides greater connectivity and convenience to overseas 
markets for customers in eastern China, particularly those 
shipping to the U.S. and Europe. The 134,000 square-meter facility includes a dedicated Customer Care Center as well as cold chain facilities to support the healthcare 
industry, one of the fastest growing sectors in the Asia 
Pacific region. With a fully automated sorting system, the new facility can process up to 36,000 packages and documents per hour, using technology to keep customers up-to-date and reduce their logistics costs. Dedicated 
China Customs and China Entry-Exit Inspection and 
Quarantine areas improve the customs clearance process.Supporting Global Trade
One of the most important issues facing business leaders today is the role of trade in the global digital economy. Trade opens new markets and opportunities 
for businesses, customers and consumers worldwide. 
According to the 2017 FedEx SME Trade Index , more  
than 80 percent of U.S. small business owners view global trade as helping the economy and providing 
opportunities and jobs. FedEx advocates for an  
ambitious trade agenda that contributes to opportunities for our customers and our company.
In FY17, FedEx sponsored the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation CEO Summit, a platform to discuss trade 
reform with Asia’s business and government leaders in support of lowering barriers and simplified trade rules in a modern digital economy. We also made it a priority to focus on the North American Free Trade Agreement 
negotiations related to customs simplification and trade 
facilitation to help address the rise in global e-commerce. Raising de minimis levels will make it easier and faster  to ship low-value goods across borders. 
We continued to support the World Trade Organization’s 
Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) that was ratified in 2017, which will help reduce administrative costs for  small and medium-sized companies — the businesses 
most affected by complicated customs procedures  
around the world. www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouQLheAgmyc

Just as we help our customers navigate their supply 
chains for success in global markets, we also collaborate with our suppliers for mutual success. We expect our 
suppliers — including equipment manufacturers, fuel 
companies, transportation service providers and many others — to uphold the principles in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  and aspire to meet our other CSR 
policy commitments.
Managing Supply Chain Risk
Across our global business, we work to identify and manage critical supply chain risks through robust, enterprise-wide policies and procedures. FedEx suppliers 
work closely with us to mitigate risks, especially those 
inherent in extended supply chains. We mitigate the most significant risks by focusing on those suppliers critically dependent to our business success. Our Sourcing 
organization’s Supplier Relationship Management 
team leads efforts to improve those suppliers’ sustainability practices.
Supplier sustainability risk screening criteria in new 
business requests also allow us to evaluate new and 
potential suppliers on performance in environmental, social, labor and human rights areas, including child and forced labor. Our Sourcing team conducts regular supplier screenings to evaluate sustainability performance and 
work with suppliers on any necessary improvements. 
During the 2017 fiscal year, 73 percent of FedEx suppliers participating in new business requests were screened  for social and environmental performance, more than  
1 percentage point higher than the previous year.Our Diverse Suppliers
We strengthen our supply chain by proactively sourcing 
from small, minority- and women-owned businesses. In FY17, we procured $9.1 billion in goods and services 
from diverse suppliers. Of the $9.1 billion spent, 9 percent 
was with women-owned businesses.

FedEx started operations 45 years ago with a visionary 
entrepreneur who had an innovative idea, and has successfully led and executed on that vision into the 
present. During this time, our support for business, 
including small business, has never wavered. Today, the FedEx Entrepreneur Advisory Board formalizes our commitments to small business by providing opportunities 
for entrepreneurs to strategize with FedEx about the ways 
we can better serve them. From providing products and services that help small businesses run more efficiently — like our Packaging Help Hub — to mentoring, workshops and grants, we support the economic empowerment that 
begins with a good idea and an entrepreneurial spirit.Small Business Grant Contest
The FedEx Small Business Grant Contest , started in the 
U.S. in FY13, awards grants and other prizes to help small 
entrepreneurs grow their businesses. Over the past five 
years, the contest has grown around the world, and in 
FY17 it expanded to India, Italy and China, for a total  of ten countries. This year’s winners included a number  of enterprises dedicated to sustainability, such as:
• U.S. grand prize winner Sword & Plough makes bags 
and accessories from military tents, sleeping bag 
covers, bullet casings and other military surplus.  
In addition to donating 10 percent of profits to veteran organizations, this woman-owned business has helped support 65 part-time and full-time veteran jobs and  has recycled thousands of pounds of military surplus.
• Terra Klay sells artisanal black clay pottery made by tribal women in India, where the company has made  
an impact on the lives of 20 artists and their families  
by giving them a means to earn income.
• Manisha Dhatrak of Varun Agro Processing Foods supports local farmers and uses surplus tomatoes in  a ketchup production unit. Her business also plans to train local farmers in sustainable farming techniques.
• Ana by Karma Limited sells handmade scarves to help Bhutanese women make a living and reinvests 
profits into training programs for the weavers and 
their children.FedEx Know and GrowSM

FedEx and Accion
FedEx and Accion, the largest nationwide nonprofit lending network in the U.S., are working together to connect entrepreneurs with the capital and the knowledge 
they need to build a better future. FedEx and Accion are 
helping small business owners increase revenue and a majority of these businesses create two to three new jobs as early as one year after receiving a loan. FedEx also 
works with Accion in Colombia, providing digital learning 
resources for low-income, low-literacy entrepreneurs, especially women, who live in more remote areas and cannot attend in-person training.Inner City Capital Connections
FedEx sponsored the Inner City Capital Connections (ICCC) program at the FedEx Institute of Technology on the University of Memphis campus, providing mentoring 
to nearly 90 participating companies representing 13 
industries in the Memphis area. This cohort represented 87 percent minority-owned and 34 percent women-owned businesses. Since participating in this effort, 27 
entrepreneurs have gone on to create 139 jobs. Overall,

those who need it most. When disaster strikes, we mobilize the FedEx global fleet and logistics expertise  
to provide supplies quickly to support people in need  
as they deal with the immediate aftermath of disaster  and when they begin rebuilding their communities.  Even when there’s no emergency, FedEx transports other 
precious cargo safely, from student robots to historic 
artifacts. In FY17, our in-kind shipping program donated space for more than 4.5 million pounds of goods, totaling 79,000 shipments.Disaster Relief
Our extensive network allows us to reach communities when few others can, providing vital resources to help neighborhoods, schools, businesses and economies  
get up and running as quickly as possible and provide  
a pathway for recovery. Our work begins well before a disaster hits, by prepositioning relief supplies and sharing insight into our own response, recovery and management 
planning with relief organizations. Among others, we work 
with Direct Relief, International Medical Corps, American Red Cross, Heart to Heart International and others to deliver emergency supplies.
2017 Relief Efforts
2017 saw intense storms that made landfall with tremendous force, along with earthquakes, wildfires, flooding and other disasters. When four of these 
disasters struck in the span of just one month — including 
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as earthquakes — we delivered essential resources to communities and businesses in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, Mexico and 
elsewhere. FedEx pledged $3 million in cash and in-kind 
shipping to victims of the hurricanes and earthquakes, delivering water treatment systems, blankets, clean-up and comfort kits and other supplies.
• Hurricane Irma, Florida: 80 tons of medical supplies, 
water and meals.
• Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico: 75 tons of supplies, including water, food and toiletries. 
• Hurricane Harvey, Texas: delivered more than 20,000 meals, enough to feed 1,000 people three meals  a day for a week.
• Multiple earthquakes in Mexico: water treatment systems that could provide clean drinking water  
for 30,000 people a day, 120 tons of relief aid  
and volunteering by 800 FedEx team members.Community Giving: Delivering for Good

Our Approach
Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize
We continually seek new ways to maximize operational 
efficiency, minimize impacts and find innovative solutions through our Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize  approach 
to sustainability. We reduce or eliminate impacts from activities and operations. We replace assets that can be improved, using the right solutions in the right applications. And, we revolutionize operations by 
discovering and applying new innovative technologies.
This approach provides structure, consistency and 
support to programs that deliver cost savings and  more efficient use of resources in four key areas:
• Aircraft efficiency
• Vehicle efficiency
• Sustainable facilities
• Sustainable materials and recycling
Across all four priorities, our focus on reducing, replacing 
and revolutionizing allows us to use the building blocks  of performance, transparency, innovation and leadership to embed sustainability into the way we do business.  
The FedEx team member-led EarthSmart
® program 
delivers ideas for environmental improvements.  
Our EarthSmart framework, now in its ninth year, embeds 
sustainability into the way we operate and how we serve 
customers — through innovation and workplace culture. Each FedEx business unit leverages EarthSmart in unique ways to address the impacts and opportunities most 
relevant to its operations, with EarthSmart providing 
structure, consistency and support to environmental programs that deliver cost savings and more efficient use of resources. Ultimately, EarthSmart strives for groundbreaking environmental stewardship that can  
be shared with others.

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexEnergy and GHG Emissions
Emissions from our transportation fleet, both on the 
ground and in the air, as well as those associated with our facilities, are our greatest areas of environmental 
impact, as transportation fuel represents 92 percent of 
our emissions footprint. As we continue to handle record numbers of customer packages each year, we prioritize technologies and initiatives that improve efficiency in 
our vehicle and aircraft fleets, as well as in our facilities. 
This includes:
• Setting ambitious fuel efficiency and emission-
reduction targets.
• Modernizing our aircraft and vehicle fleet, using innovative technologies and making operational improvements to routing, automation and other procedures.
• Incorporating alternative fuels into our fleet.
•  Finding new ways to engage team members and 
customers in energy efficiency initiatives, from identifying energy-saving alternatives in our buildings to right-sizing customer packaging to maximize space 
and optimize loads.
• Advocating for regulatory and policy changes that support societal benefits like emissions reduction, 
efficiency improvements and cleaner technology.

The FedEx Carbon-Neutral Envelope Shipping program 
supports low-carbon development projects around the world, offsetting some of the carbon emissions 
created and emitted in shipping FedEx Envelopes 
for customers. These projects not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also improve quality  of life in the communities where they are based.
In FY17, more than 198 million carbon-neutral FedEx 
envelopes were delivered to customers, offsetting nearly 75,000 metric tons of CO
2e emissions.  
In that fiscal year, we invested in eight carbon offset projects across the world that positively affect diverse 
communities in China, India, Mexico, Peru, the U.S. 
and Zambia. These projects produced emissions reductions on four continents, while supporting  better health, training and education, renewable 
energy, energy efficiency and habitat protection.
Since the program began, we have shipped over a 
billion carbon-neutral envelopes for our customers. Our participation is one more example of the ways  
we support communities around the world.

 Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI IndexAircraft Efficiency
To make sure the 660-plus aircraft in our fleet operate 
as efficiently and environmentally responsibly as possible, we apply the three-part Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize 
approach: implementing a multitude of fuel efficiencies 
in flight operations through our global FedEx
® Fuel Sense 
program (Reduce), upgrading and modernizing our planes (Replace) and exploring use of alternative fuels and 
technologies (Revolutionize).
Since 2005, our aircraft emissions intensity has decreased 
by more than 22 percent, although our aircraft emissions intensity improvements effectively remained unchanged in 
FY17 due to higher shipping volumes. A key challenge has 
been the need to maintain some older aircraft that have been earmarked for retirement while we await production of more efficient replacements.
Reduce
FedEx® Fuel Sense
Our long-standing FedEx Fuel Sense program identifies efficiencies across aviation operations by drawing on the insights and ideas of front-line team members and experts 
who contribute to a culture of fuel-saving behavior. A total 
of 54 projects have been identified since the program began in 2006, and 561 million gallons of jet fuel have been saved since then as well. Collectively, FedEx Fuel Sense programs saved almost 88 million gallons of jet fuel in FY17, and avoided almost 850,000 metric tons of CO
2e 
emissions. For more about the ways our team members contribute to the FedEx culture of efficiency, see People .
Replace
Aircraft Modernization
Our aircraft modernization program, a priority that reflects the ongoing evolution of our aircraft efficiency and emissions reduction strategy, now contributes even more 
significantly to our continued reduction in energy use and 
emissions. At the end of FY17, the first of three phases of aircraft replacement was complete. By replacing older aircraft with newer models, such as the Boeing 767-
300 Freighters, which are about 30 percent more fuel 
efficient than the MD10s they replace, we not only save fuel and reduce emissions, but also enhance operational flexibility and operating margins. In FY17, the aircraft fleet 
modernization program saved 89.3 million gallons of jet 
fuel, avoiding more than 860,000 metric tons of CO
2e 
emissions, almost 26 percent more emissions avoided than the previous fiscal year.
In addition to large jets, our feeder aircraft fleet will also 
be upgraded in the coming years. These represent aircraft operated by another company. These smaller propeller planes cover shorter routes. While their overall emissions and efficiency gains are smaller than those of larger 
aircraft, upgrading these planes helps to reduce our  
Scope 3 emissions.

Aircraft Biofuels
Our fleet modernization and FedEx® Fuel Sense initiatives  
have reduced emissions, but we want to do even more, 
which is why we set a goal to obtain 30 percent of jet fuel 
from alternative fuels by 2030. In FY15, we entered into 
an agreement with Colorado-based Red Rock Biofuels, which will ultimately produce at least 48 million gallons of alternative jet fuel over an eight-year period. Construction 
of the fuel refinery is planned to begin in July 2018, and 
the first delivery of commercially viable and available alternative fuels is anticipated in 2020.
Boeing ecoDemonstrator
FedEx and Boeing collaborated to test more than 35 technologies aboard a specially equipped FedEx-owned 777 Freighter, the sixth Boeing ecoDemonstrator aircraft 
tested to date. We worked with Boeing for two years 
to identify the technologies for testing. Some of the technologies have been designed to reduce emissions and noise, while also offering the potential to improve gate-to-gate efficiency and other operational goals. The 
plane went into service in the FedEx fleet during FY18 
flying international routes, before being returned to Boeing to serve as the ecoDemonstrator testbed. After Boeing’s final testing is completed in mid-2018, the airplane will  
be delivered to FedEx for continued service.

ecoDemonstrator for FedEx: http://about.van.fedex.com/blog/boeing-777-ecodemonstrator/
Toward Carbon-Neutral Growth
We continue supporting and adopting other efficiency initiatives, including industry-wide efforts. For instance, we are working to meet the requirements of the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International 
Aviation (CORSIA) program developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. Like a number of U.S. airlines, we 
actively supported our industry association in helping 
ICAO develop the CORSIA program for international flights, which aims to assist airlines in meeting the industry goal of carbon-neutral growth after 2020. 
Beginning in January 2019, our aircraft emissions 
monitoring will establish the baseline for 2021 and beyond. FedEx is preparing for implementation of CORSIA, while we also continue to make advances in operations and our use of technology while supporting global aviation 
infrastructure improvements as well.
In April 2018, the Boeing 
ecoDemonstrator became the  first aircraft to fly 100% on biofuel.

The FedEx global ground transportation fleet is large  
— more than 170,000 on- and off-road vehicles,  of which approximately 80,000 are company-owned 
vehicles over which we have operational control.  
As with aircraft efficiency, our Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize approach guides our efforts to lower fuel consumption and emissions, with the three elements 
serving as a foundation to deliver results:
1.  Reduce  miles driven and fuel used through efficiencies 
such as optimizing route structure.
2.  Replace  older elements of our vehicle fleet with the 
most up-to-date and sophisticated technology viably 
available, like having the right sized vehicle with the  right engine on the right route.
3.  Revolutionize  our fleet through timely testing

Alternative Fuel Vehicles
We believe that wider adoption of alternative-fuel, electric 
and hybrid electric vehicles will play a key role in reducing our global emissions. This offers the opportunity for near-
term adoption, while we work toward the implementation 
of more advanced technologies like hydrogen fuel cells over the longer term.

Electric VehiclesIn FY17, we added 292 electric vehicles to our fleet, resulting in more than 2,100 electric vehicles in service by the end of the fiscal year. Most of that increase was due to growth in electric ground support equipment for FedEx 
Express at airports, as well as increased use of electric 
forklifts at FedEx Freight. As electric vehicle technology continues to improve and battery costs decrease, we see electric vehicles as a promising alternative to traditional 
fuel vans and trucks. In addition, FedEx Freight recently 
announced plans to order 20 Tesla Semi fully-electric trucks, which are scheduled to begin production in 2019.Following several years of electric vehicle demonstration projects, FedEx Express is now looking to move on to the 
next phase of our electric vehicle deployment strategy. 
Due to capacity limitations in some public electrical  grids however, this next phase of our electrification strategy involves working closely with electric utilities  and governments in key markets to make sure the system 
can support the large-scale use of electric vehicles. 
Concurrently, we are focusing on our own facilities to 
make sure they are equipped to manage the demands of charging many electric vehicles at once. This entails 
exploring options for fast, reliable charging of various 
battery systems, and the role our on-site solar installations can play in providing renewable energy to power an electric vehicle fleet.
Compressed Natural Gas
Some of our operating companies, such as FedEx Freight, continue sourcing compressed natural gas (CNG) equipment for short-haul city use. FedEx Freight added 
79 CNG road and city vehicles in FY17 to reduce diesel 
fuel use and emissions, bringing the total in service at that operating company to 105. Incorporating more alternative fuel vehicles has also required that we add or upgrade infrastructure to accommodate CNG, educate drivers 
about the CNG fueling process and review routes to 
accommodate CNG capacity limits.
Hydrogen Fuel Cells
Hydrogen fuel cell technology also might offer low-
emission alternatives to traditional engines, and could 
provide excellent range for longer routes. Through a  U.S. Department of Energy grant, FedEx Express is currently evaluating a medium-duty fuel cell vehicle  
with an extended range. Already, we operate 15 fuel  
cell tractors at our Memphis airport hub.BiodieselFedEx Ground provides biodiesel to contracted service 
providers to improve environmental performance. In FY17, 
the biodiesel provided through our network of fuel islands avoided almost 60,000 metric tons of CO
2e emissions.  
At 23 locations, we have our own bio-blending capabilities, which allows us to provide the same level  
of fuel quality as retail sites, and we are expanding  
the fuel island network throughout the U.S. and Canada.  We continue to explore the feasibility of offering additional alternative fuel types as we work to reduce our 
environmental impacts.
Innovations for Urban Mobility
Continued operational innovation is also key to addressing growing global challenges to urban mobility. As the 
number of vehicles on the road in many cities has 
outpaced infrastructure, FedEx is exploring options for minimizing the number of vehicles we have on the road. For instance, we are exploring innovative approaches  that would allow us to transport a large batch of packages  
to one area of a city, then use small electric vehicles  or tricycles to deliver them to their final destinations.  This would help to minimize the number of larger  delivery vans and trucks in congested city centers.
Electrification Coalition
FedEx Chairman and CEO, Frederick W. Smith, serves on the Electrification Coalition, a nonpartisan, not-for-profit group of U.S. business leaders committed 
to promoting policies and actions that facilitate the 
deployment of electric vehicles on a mass scale.

Responsible Packaging
FedEx branded packaging — the familiar envelopes and 
corrugated boxes provided to our customers and used to secure shipments in transit — makes up our largest 
volume of material used. To minimize the potential for 
wasted packaging, we work diligently to make sure packages are delivered free of any damage that could  lead to a return and replacement. In addition, as the 
number of global shipments continues to grow, so does 
the volume of recycled packaging we provide. By working closely with suppliers in FY17, we sourced almost  3,300 more metric tons of recycled packaging than  in FY16, focusing on increasing recycled content.
For details about the volume and percentages of 
packaging materials, paper, and other operational materials with recycled content, see the Data Appendix .
More Efficient Packaging through 
Dimensional Weight Pricing
Engaging and supporting our customers in shipping 
packages more efficiently is central to our shared progress on sustainability. FedEx Express and FedEx Ground apply 
what is known as dimensional, or dim, weight pricing.  
This practice sets the transportation price based on package volume — the amount of space a package occupies in relation to its actual weight — with dim 
weight calculated by using the length, width and height 
of a package. The approach allows us to make the best use of space in our aircraft, vehicles and distribution centers; improves loading efficiency for planes, trucks and vans; and reduces associated emissions. Dim weight 
pricing also encourages our customers to make packaging 
adjustments that maximize product density and reduce paper, corrugated board and filler materials to support  the sustainability of their operations.Lower Costs and Impacts  
with FedEx Packaging Services
Optimizing package size and design can reduce costs 
for our customers and minimize environmental impacts, so FedEx Packaging Services offers custom engineering 
guidance and on-site support to commercial customers 
who want to right-size their packaging. Our specialty engineers assess existing packaging and recommend more efficient designs, followed by laboratory 
performance testing to make sure the redesigned 
packaging meets customer needs with just the right amount of material. Customers submit a sample package including all the packaging materials and contents in the exact configuration they want to use, FedEx tests the 
package for strength, as well as integrity and durability, 
and provides results in 4 to 5 business days.
During FY17, the FedEx Packaging Lab conducted more 
than 5,000 small parcel tests and 324 freight tests.  
Our engineers also completed nearly 2,000 on-site 
customer consultations and provided 63 new designs  to improve customer packaging, protect against  product damage and offer dim weight savings.

use and recycle paper. Across the FedEx enterprise, 
the majority of our paper use takes place during printing operations at FedEx Office stores. With approximately 1,900 FedEx Office locations, providing customers with 
sustainable paper options is essential. We stock clearly 
labeled, sustainably sourced paper options, which we encourage customers to choose.
The FedEx Office forest-based product procurement 
policy includes vendor requirements for responsible 
forest-management practices as well as recycled-content standards. In FY17, the paper available to customers at FedEx Office locations contained 54 percent post-consumer waste recycled content.
FedEx Office applies a holistic approach to responsibly 
sourcing, using and recycling paper, as well as to managing operations. This includes leveraging communications to engage team members and 
customers in our sustainable practices, along with a 
forest-based product procurement policy that encourages manufacturing of innovative, sustainable paper products.
We purchase the vast majority of our paper from 
certified sustainable forest programs, such as the Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC). In fact, 99.6 percent of all paper purchased by FedEx Office during FY17 was third-party certified, including nearly 88 percent that was FSC 
certified. In addition to purchasing our paper from certified 
forest programs, we are looking to reduce tree pulp consumption overall. We have already begun purchasing “tree-free” products, or those that use alternative fibers, like agricultural residues. We plan to continue researching 
these alternatives and others to ensure the continued 
reduction of our paper footprint.For more information about our supplier purchasing policies, please see Economy .
For the percentages of FSC and other third-party-certified sustainable paper used by FedEx Office year over year, see the Data Appendix .
Engaging our Customers
At FedEx Office and other operating companies, we strive to make it easy for our customers to participate in reducing their own materials use and increasing recycling. 
A few of our solutions include:
• Print Online  — helps our commercial customers print 
locally to avoid unnecessary shipping, and allows them 
to preview projects before production, which reduces wasted pages.
• Paper Recycling  — FedEx Office offers paper recycling 
for customers who bring their paper in to be shredded confidentially and then recycled by a third party.
Waste and Recycling
As our business grows to meet the accelerating demands of e-commerce and other shipping needs, our waste management strategies will help ensure we recycle more 
of our own waste and encourage customers to recycle 
our packaging. Already, 91 percent of FedEx branded packaging is recyclable, and 56 percent is made from recycled content. In FY17, 72 percent of the solid waste 
generated in our operations was sent to recyclers.
For details about the volume of waste generated, recycled 
and landfilled year over year, see the Data Appendix . 
Included are:
• Solid waste
• Hazardous waste
• Non-hazardous regulated waste
• Universal waste
• Electronic wasteCollaborating on Closed Loop Recycling
Each year, FedEx Ground uses approximately 635 
metric tons of small parcel sort bags in hub operations. Over time, they become unusable, so we joined forces 
with Petoskey Plastics, a supplier of innovative plastic 
materials, to create a closed loop program that would recycle 100 percent of the parcel sort bags and eliminate them from the waste stream.
At the heart of the program is a recycled — and recyclable 
— three-layer bag that consists of 36 percent recycled content, including bags previously used at FedEx Ground facilities. Since we launched the program 10 years ago, 
these innovative bags have been put into use throughout 
the FedEx Ground network. And by working closely  with our supplier to share timely information about usage needs and other factors, we have created a program that lays the groundwork for potential expansion into other 
FedEx operations.

Sustainable Transportation
By 2050, some 70 percent of the world will live in cities, 
potentially leading to a significant increase in vehicles, gridlock, diminished air quality and other challenges. 
Around the world, FedEx is working with communities to 
help them grow responsibly by drawing on our expertise in transportation and logistics, as well as forging long-term alliances with organizations that design cities for a better 
future. Working with the World Resources Institute’s 
Ross Center for Sustainable Cities (WRI Ross Center) through grant funding, knowledge sharing, research and assessment, pilot projects and skills-based volunteering, FedEx is supporting sustainable, safe and innovative 
transportation solutions for 36 cities in four countries.
In the coming years, electric buses will be central to 
sustainable urban transportation systems. They are quieter than traditional buses, produce less air pollution, 
offer better service quality, and when coupled with 
renewable energy projects, reduce even more emissions throughout their lifecycle.
Brazil:  Belo Horizonte, a state capital with 2.5 million 
residents, has set ambitious targets for adopting electric 
buses, thanks to the Vehicles and Fuels Fleet Selection Tool, which was developed with support from FedEx.  The city will transition 40 percent of its fleet from  
diesel to electric by 2030.
India:  Using FedEx routing expertise, Bangalore has 
reduced daily passenger wait and travel times by two 
hours in the largest bus network in India, which serves 
150,000 passengers a day. Research and assistance 
helped the city set emissions targets and secure  funding for 150 electric buses.
China:  In Zhuzhou, a planned 23 km bus rapid transit 
(BRT) system will reduce travel time by 50 percent and 
serve more than 70 percent of the city’s transit users.  In a broader initiative, FedEx is supporting guidelines  to help Chinese cities maintain electric fleets throughout their life cycle.
Mexico:  Building on previous contributions by FedEx 
safety experts toward training for Mexico City’s bus 
drivers, efforts have begun to establish a baseline for bus traffic incidents and measure the impact of safety training. 
WRI Ross Center is also adapting the FedEx Vehicles 
and Fuels Bus Selection Tool to support improved vehicle technology in Mexican cities.

Team Member Career Development
Our culture emphasizes strong training and development 
programs at all career levels, helps employees leverage the vast job opportunities available across our operating 
companies and promotes managers from within.
Training and Development
Key to retaining top talent is investing in our team 
members’ continued learning and development. In FY17, each employee participated in an average of 19.38 hours 
of formal training. Much of this came through the online 
FedEx Learning Center, where team members can access more than 21,000 courses that cover skills essential to their, and the company’s, continued growth. 
Collaborations with universities and other learning 
institutions provide even more avenues for team member development, as does tuition assistance. In FY17, more than 5,650 employees received a total of $12.7 million  in tuition assistance to further their education.
Additional training and development initiatives include:
• EXCEL DRIVE and Global Leadership Corps to develop 
current and prospective leaders across the company
• FedEx Ground instructor-led training for area managers, operations managers and others
• Webinars for FedEx Supply Chain facility supervisors
• Courses, videos and book summaries provided by  
third parties for use by FedEx Services
For information about our anti-corruption, anti-
discrimination and related training, see Governance .  
For management and non-management training hours, 
see the Data Appendix .Specialized Learning for our Tech Talent
The FedEx Institute of Technology at the University  
of Memphis recently launched the Agile Academy,  a multi-course training program tailored to FedEx IT 
employees and taught by faculty from the University of 
Memphis, Boston University and University of Sydney. Employees have taken the courses to further develop their skills in specific technologies, as well as in project 
management and testing. Future plans include scaling  
the program to other key FedEx sites in the U.S.
Performance Management
During the 2017 fiscal year, 97 percent of employees participated in traditional, ratings-based performance reviews. FedEx Ground, FedEx Corporate and FedEx 
Services began refining how we assess employee 
performance to provide a path to more frequent feedback. This shift to ongoing coaching and feedback provides even greater opportunities for employees to drive their 
performance and career development. Already in the  
2017 fiscal year, 3,200 FedEx Services employees participated in the coaching-focused performance process. By the end of FY18, more than 6,700 employees at FedEx Services and Corporate will make the shift to 
coaching-focused performance management, with clearly 
defined goals and expectations connected to consistent coaching conversations between management and their team members.Gaining Ground in Coaching
In FY17, FedEx Ground launched Gaining Ground,  a proactive performance management program  in which employees drive the goal-setting and 
conversations, and feedback is frequent and 
qualitative. Goals are strategically aligned with department and organizational goals, giving  employees an even stronger connection to the 
success of the company. To support the change, 
FedEx Ground launched eight training modules  for employees and managers and will continue  to build deeper skill and knowledge levels over  the next three years.

Every day, we work to earn and maintain the loyalty of 
our team members. Over the years, we have created a workplace culture that aims to support their aspirations, 
while enhancing the communities we serve around the 
world through job opportunities. To attract talent, we use a combination of technology-based sourcing and local outreach through community events, job fairs and trade 
school education sessions. Our Summer 2017 College 
Connections program included 155 interns, more than  56 percent of whom went on to positions at FedEx.
FedEx Ground moved to a more proactive hiring strategy 
in FY17 by implementing Talent Networks. These 
customized career microsites allow people to create  a profile for future interest in FedEx Ground positions.  Talent Networks provide the option of submitting a resume, learning about specific career areas at FedEx 
Ground, signing up for job/email alerts and searching 
for current openings. The individual’s information is also retained in a back-end database that can be accessed when a position does become available.
When careers at FedEx end, we provide career transition 
and outplacement services to eligible employees globally. Through a third party, FedEx offers career coaching, job search, access to professional skills development and 
other support to assist in managing career endings and 
continued employability in the broader market.
In FY17, we retained 88 percent of our full-time U.S. team 
members, the same rate as in FY16. Globally, FedEx hired 
163,755 full- and part-time team members in FY17, while 
142,805 left the company in this period. Most of these positions involved part-time hourly workers, including package handlers.
For details about employee retention, including turnover 
by gender year-over-year, see the Data Appendix .Growing our Workforce from Within
We prioritize promoting team members from within and regularly post positions internally before advertising them publicly.
For information about the ways we build a diverse 
and inclusive workplace, see Diversity & Inclusion .Team Member Career Development
Global Leadership Corps
Global Leadership Corps is a four-month learning program for selected FedEx employees to experience additional networking and development opportunities. In FY17, 
28 team members participated, spending time in either 
Brno, Czech Republic or Warsaw, Poland. They provided hands-on guidance and expertise to non-profits that support employment for youth and people with 
disabilities, alleviate poverty and discrimination, foster 
sustainable development and assist people with Alzheimer’s disease, among others. Through these diverse experiences, participants had opportunities  to improve leadership, communication and teamwork 
skills, while building cultural awareness and advancing  
our FedEx Cares initiatives. Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI Index2018 FedEx Global Citizenship Report 47
How We Engage Our People
We strive to enable our team members to build successful 
careers and have a rewarding work experience through education and training, as well as through various 
approaches to feedback, discussion and ongoing 
engagement.
Listening to Team Members
This includes listening to our team members through annual surveys, employee networks and direct feedback to management so we can improve the team member 
experience and strengthen our business. For instance, 
FedEx Freight regularly holds roundtable meetings to encourage open discussions with small groups of employees. In FY17, more than 3,000 FedEx Freight 
employees took part in 119 of these meetings.
FedEx Ground also rolled out a new engagement survey 
process — the Employee Experience Questionnaire. Implemented in collaboration with Gallup, the new 
questionnaire offers greater insight into the overall 
engagement of our team as measured against Gallup’s robust and heavily researched database, areas of strengths and the areas on which we should be focusing greater efforts to provide an even better employee 
experience. During FY17, the first year, 70 percent of 
employees participated. Twenty-five FedEx Ground engagement champions have also trained more than 8,800 management team members to encourage others 
to make the most of this opportunity to share feedback.Collectively Bargained Agreements at FedEx
The vast majority of FedEx employees do not work under 
a collectively bargained agreement, and FedEx believes in compensating and treating our employees in a fair 
manner. In the U.S., a group of employees’ decision  
to unionize is their own, and FedEx respects that right; but the company’s track record with respect to employee relations demonstrates that most of our employees  
prefer a direct relationship with the company.
The pilots of FedEx Express, which represent a small 
number of total employees at FedEx Express, are employed under a collective bargaining agreement 
that took effect on November 2, 2015. This collective 
bargaining agreement is scheduled to become amendable in November 2021, after a six-year term.
In addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, FedEx Supply 
Chain, Inc. has a small number of employees who are 
members of unions, and FedEx Freight drivers at one location have voted for union representation, but are not currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Internationally, there are some unionized employees  
who do not fall within the umbrella of U.S. labor law.

to Date since FY16Community Giving: Employment Pathways
Helping Young People Enter the Workforce
One-third of the U.S. unemployment rate is due to the gap 
between skills and open jobs. With our extensive reach, we help pave the way for young people in underserved 
communities to develop the skills, resources and job 
access they need to enter the workforce. Employment Pathways is our commitment to creating routes to economic opportunity for these populations. This 
commitment stems from our deep belief that the diverse 
backgrounds of our team members make us successful, so we want to help even more people learn the skills they need to succeed in the workplace.
This pillar of FedEx Cares supports success through 
three pathways: education, job training and access to employment. Through our investments, we are helping underserved youth navigate the college application process, train for high-demand jobs such as in tech and 
logistics, and access employment through credential 
programs. Because our nation’s veterans also face barriers to employment, FedEx supports Hiring Our Heroes Hiring Fairs across the country, and our operating 
companies participate at various locations. Together, 
all of these pathways enable economic mobility and healthier communities. And, since we began focusing on Employment Pathways in 2016, the program has expanded significantly.
For more information see Economy .
For more about the ways we are expanding access 
to employment for underserved and marginalized 
populations, see Diversity & Inclusion .Innovative Diversity & Inclusion Programs
FedEx supports avenues to employment for youth who 
are out of school and do not have college degrees.  Our Pathfinder Program, a new initiative in FY17, creates 
entry-level career paths for young people in the U.S.,  
with an emphasis on IT positions. The program was inspired by the First Job Compact proposal set forth by the White House and the Department of Labor in 
2016, which encouraged communities and businesses 
to connect out-of-school, out-of-work youth and young adults to their first jobs. We piloted the program in June 2017 with six young people and since then, three have been hired as full-time, permanent employees. We will 
continue to collaborate with non-traditional talent sources 
in FY18 to place youth into jobs at FedEx.
The FedEx Services Diverse Intern Access Initiative  
effort increased the number of diverse applicants 
and hires during the summer 2017 intern program by 
promoting job postings to diverse organizations and universities. This outreach led to 81 percent of  participants receiving full-time offers.
Two innovative FedEx Supply Chain programs, Project 
Us and Getting Hired, build paths to employment for individuals with disabilities, including seniors and veterans. Through ongoing Project Us collaborations 
with local agencies, skills assessments, coaching and 
job placement, FedEx helps people transition to the workforce, despite physical and other challenges. Getting Hired also advances the careers of millions of skilled, qualified workers with disabilities. FedEx Supply Chain 
participates in virtual career fairs to help link people 
to positions, provides interview training and sponsors National Disability Awareness Month efforts. Our Company  Economy  Environment  People  GRI Index2018 FedEx Global Citizenship Report 49
Team Member Quality of Life
Our people are the foundation of our success and the 
key to our future. We empower them to create the innovative solutions our customers depend on, support 
the communities we serve and help us operate more 
sustainably. By investing in competitive health care,  well-being and retirement benefits, and fostering a safe and inclusive workplace, we help our team members 
perform at their best.
Health and Wellness
FedEx offers health programs and competitive health 
benefits for eligible full-time and part-time team members and their dependents. We cover most healthcare costs  
for our U.S. team members, including medical, dental  
and vision coverage. Team members can also access  a 24-hour nurse line, integrated personal health teams  and a medical decision support group free of charge. 
Maternity and flexible work options are available to help 
employees manage work-life balance. FedEx also provides short- and long-term disability and life insurance benefits to eligible team members.
Team member wellness programs, including healthy 
weight management and tobacco cessation programs, stress-management classes, access to health club services and other resources, reflect our holistic approach to supporting well-being. In FY17, 82,833 team members 
took part in our Healthways Well-Being Program, which 
includes one-on-one coaching and practical tools that inform smart health choices. In collaboration with Premise Health and Walgreens, we also piloted a new diabetes management program. And, the new Choose Well portal has received more than 2 million page views since June 2017, making it even easier for team members to access 
health care information.
In addition to family-friendly benefits such as maternity 
leave and financial assistance with adoptions, FedEx offers a Work-Life Balance Program to all U.S. team 
members. Team members can access specialists and 
online resources for advice and support on common life events and challenges, such as parenting, child care and financial matters. In FY17, the program had approximately 
123,000 active registered users, 20,000 more than the 
previous year.
Convenient Health Centers
Dedicated FedEx health centers operated by Walgreens and Premise Health now operate at two locations in Memphis near the largest FedEx Memphis-area work 
facilities. The health centers provide a variety of health 
services all in one place, including primary care, lab services, physical therapy, and a full service pharmacy. During FY17, there were more than 16,000 provider  
visits at the health centers and 61,515 prescriptions  
filled at the pharmacies.
See Economy  for more about our alliance with  
Walgreens Saving for the Future.Saving for the Future
We encourage eligible U.S. team members to save 
for retirement through our pension and 401(k) plans. In FY17, 94 percent of U.S.-based team members 
participated in our 401(k) plans. To encourage greater 
retirement plan participation, we held 24 benefits fairs, 78 on-site presentations and 32 webinars, and made personal contact with more than 7,000 team members 
and spouses in FY17. FedEx Express Canada also has 
a pension program and other savings vehicles, such as Tax-Free Savings Accounts and Registered Retirement Savings Plans, with 97.3 percent of team members participating.
FedEx announced major investments in our team 
members following the recent U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We committed to more than $200 million in increased compensation, about two-thirds of which will go to hourly 
team members, as well as a voluntary contribution of  
$1.5 billion to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans. As a result, we were ranked second among all companies reviewed by JUST Capital for our commitment 
to invest the projected tax savings toward employees and 
jobs. In addition, FedEx Express was ranked fourth for pay and benefits among all companies reviewed by Indeed.

Diversity & Inclusion
The diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and 
experiences our team members bring to the company is integral to our success as we continue reaching new 
customers at home and abroad. Diversity and inclusion  
at FedEx connects people and possibilities to deliver a better future for team members, customers, suppliers  and communities. 
We do this by leveraging internal programs and best-
in-class external resources to recruit, develop and retain diverse team members and nurture an inclusive environment. In addition, FedEx provides diversity 
and inclusion awareness training to new hires and 
management personnel. We also offer educational materials on diversity and inclusion awareness to team members. As just one example, during FY17 FedEx Services distributed the Diversity & Inclusion Officer 
Toolkit, which equips and enables our leaders to  
champion diversity and inclusion with their teams.
Each operating company maintains a diversity and 
inclusion team that also participates in an enterprise-wide 
Diversity & Inclusion Corporate Council. This group meets 
monthly to further embed diversity and inclusion into our organization. Internal teams support workplace inclusion through a variety of culture and employee resource 
groups, including African American, Hispanic, Asian, 
Women, Cancer Support, Multifaith, LGBT and Friends, Multiethnic Leadership, AllGen (generational diversity) and U.S. Military Veterans. For instance, during FY17, FedEx Express and FedEx Office held diversity and inclusion 
forums during Black History Month and Hispanic  
Heritage Month through the affinity groups.Diversity and inclusion-focused initiatives were far-reaching in FY17, including sponsorships and participation in a number of conferences designed to support women’s 
leadership. We launched our second year of sponsorship 
for the Babson College Women Innovation Now Lab, an eight-month program for women entrepreneurs, and FedEx Services held its fourth annual Women in 
Leadership Summit. FedEx Ground hosted a Multicultural 
Leadership Symposium that brought together more than 100 team members to address inclusive leadership and explore career advancement. And, eight senior FedEx leaders from various regions participated in the 
International Women’s Forum.

We strive to create an open and welcoming workplace 
environment for all employees. This includes fostering  a workplace environment in which employees can come 
forward to make a claim without fear of retaliation.  
We take harassment claims seriously and treat each incident with confidentiality and sensitivity. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics , Equal Employment 
Opportunity Policy, training and related resources help team members and managers understand our expectations for maintaining a welcoming workplace  that is free of harassment and discrimination.Diversity and inclusion at FedEx

Community Giving: Volunteering
Volunteerism is at the core of FedEx Cares , which 
connects the compassion and skills of our team members 
with the resources of leading non-profits to address 
some of society’s most pressing problems. FedEx Cares 
provides the global volunteering structure aligned with our business strengths, while more locally, our team members determine how best to support communities 
in need based on locally relevant priorities for charitable 
service and giving.
In FY17, 21,650 FedEx volunteers team members 
generously contributed 111,200 hours of their time 
— equivalent to 13,900 eight-hour days — and their 
expertise to more than 500 organizations. Many of  these projects were identified and led by team  members themselves.
Celebrating Diversity  
in our Communities
In the months leading up to April 4, 2018, the 50th 
anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., FedEx joined with The National Civil Rights 
Museum in Memphis, the King Center in Atlanta,  
and other organizations in commemorating this anniversary. FedEx team members were also encouraged to commit 50 acts of kindness or  
service between January 15 and April 9, 2018.  
Among other events, more than 700 FedEx  volunteers in 11 cities spent the 2018 MLK Day of Service packaging 190,000 meals to support Rise Against Hunger. For additional ways team members commemorated Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., see our

Safety Above All
“Safety above all” has been a powerful guiding principle at 
FedEx since our inception. It translates into action through 
proactive workplace education, continual review to add 
safety improvements, use of exacting safety standards 
and protocols and investments in equipment and 
technology. Collectively, these approaches deliver year-
over-year improvements in the two key safety metrics we 
use to track performance — Lost Time Injury Rate and 
Preventable Recordable Vehicle Accident Rate. For more 
about our FY17 and year-over-year safety performance, 
see the Data Appendix .Managers also use various systems to help ensure 
safety, including field web report monitoring on safety measurements, safety observations, safety review 
boards, a safety oversight committee, and safety 
management systems. Additionally, we look for ways to include innovative technology to increase safety, such as the new LiveSafe mobile app. This app allows U.S. team 
members to share safety information with FedEx safety 
and security teams and see where they are in relation to emergency services.
Road Safety Innovations
FedEx Express, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Ground have implemented collision avoidance and lane departure technology on trucks, outward-facing cameras, collision 
mitigation, electric on-board recorders, electric logging 
devices, and other safety technology.
• FedEx Express has installed a slip-and-trip simulator 
to train team members about preventing falls at the Indianapolis hub.
• FedEx Freight has used outward-facing cameras and telematics to implement a driver consultation program for onboard triggering events.
• FedEx Ground established a new safety technology contracting standard for linehaul contracted service 
providers. Depending on the vehicle, the standard 
includes on-board video recorders, forward collision  and lane departure warnings, forward collision avoidance mitigation systems and speed limiters.
40-Year Safe Driving Awards
We are proud that thousands of our drivers have logged millions of miles without accidents during their careers. In FY17, for the first time ever, FedEx Express honored three 
40-year safe driving award recipients. These dedicated 
employees have contributed to the strong safety culture we maintain today through their exceptional service, dedication, and longstanding commitment to safety.Keeping Team Members Safe
Making sure we continue identifying and implementing best practices in safety for our team members on the road, in the air and in our facilities, takes many forms, 
starting with training on management safety programs, 
procedures and safe work methods, as well as defensive driving and hazard awareness. Safe Driving Championships
FedEx drivers (employees and contracted service provider personnel) regularly participate in state and national truck driving championships — rigorous competitions that 
test the skills of drivers with impeccable safety records. 
Eighteen FedEx drivers earned national truck driving champion honors in FY17, including a lifetime award and a grand champion, among many others. A total of 173 
FedEx drivers — representing FedEx Freight, FedEx 
Express and FedEx Ground — took home first place honors in state truck driving championships. Six earned top honors in the state fleet safety awards, and one  earned the national grand trophy in safe driving.
Air Safety
Our policies and procedures, along with our deep understanding of our operating system, help us mitigate risk in our air operations. Some of our safety 
advancements during FY17 include:
• U.S. Federal Aviation Administration officials moved our Safety Management System, which FedEx uses 
to manage aviation safety risk, into the final phase of acceptance. The system’s principles are being embedded into operational decisions to continue to 
identify and act on risk at every level of operations.
• FedEx Express brought in professors from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to train key 
personnel in our air carrier functions using systems theoretical process analysis and causal analysis, which enables teams to identify aviation failure risks before they happen.
• As part of our strategic alliance with the University of Southern California, faculty introduced our air carrier 
leadership to high-reliability organization practices, 
which build resilience into our system, allowing us  to identify and manage risk before we have an event that can injure someone or damage equipment.12.7 %
