INTEGRATED REPORT 2019PresentationBlock 5 
Includes technical data on the report—methodol-
ogy used, external auditor’s letter—a glossary of 
acronyms, and the Appendix section, with comple-
mentary information for readers who wish to gain a 
deeper understanding of specific topics;
Block 6 
Deals with the Group’s financial reports.  LATAM 
Airlines Group and most of its affiliates main-
tain their accounting records and prepare their 
financial statements in US dollars (USD). Howev-
er, some of its affiliates maintain their accounting 
records and prepare their financial statements in 
Chilean pesos, Argentinean pesos, Colombian pe-
sos, or Brazilian reals.
In particular, LATAM Airlines Brazil maintains its ac -
counting records and prepares its financial state-
ments in Brazilian reals. LATAM’s audited consoli-
dated financial statements include the results of 
these affiliates translated into US dollars.For the second consecutive year, LATAM is uniting 
financial and non-financial information more con-
sistently, based on the integrated reporting prin-
ciples of the International Integrated Reporting 
Council (IIRC) and of the GRI standards (Global Re-
porting Initiative) — main benchmark for sustain-
ability communication in the world.
READING THE REPORT  
There are six large blocks of information:
Block 1 
Focuses on the institutional information: who 
the company is, where it operates, what its deci-
sion-making process is like, and how it integrates 
sustainability in its day-to-day management;
Blocks 2, 3, and 4 
Cover the performance achieved throughout the 
year in the economic, environmental, and social 
dimensions. The organization follows the focus ad-
opted by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI);International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as issued by the International Accounting Stan-
dards Board (IASB), require assets and liabilities to 
be translated at period-end exchange rates, while 
revenue and expense accounts are translated at the 
exchange rate of each transaction date, although 
a monthly rate may also be used if exchange rates 
do not vary too widely.The 2019 Integrated Report reflects LATAM’s com-
mitment to transparency and the periodic ac -
countability to society. This edition presents the 
main results of the year regarding the most im-
portant topics for the business and the Group’s 
stakeholders.

We are moved by the mission of connecting people 
and destinations. In the framework of the celebra -
tion of our 90 years of history, we succeeded in 
setting that mission in motion transporting over 74 
million passengers who chose LATAM to fly. A record 
figure for the Company. We are pleased to have the 
certainty of offering a level of service that improves 
day by day and that adapts to the various needs of 
our passengers. The levels of punctuality that we 
achieved in 2019 were acknowledged in the main 
rankings worldwide, and reflect our commitment to 
the quality of service. With a level of punctuality of 
88%, LATAM was chosen as the most punctual air -
line in the world among the 20 main airline groups, 
according to OAG (Official Airline Guide), and the 
most punctual worldwide in the Global Airlines-Net -
work category, according to Cirium.
During 2019, our passengers witnessed the cab-
in transformation project, which has already been 
applied to 67 aircrafts and will continue in 2020, 
with a total investment of US$400 million. To of -
fer appealing alternatives to our passengers, and 
based on their different profiles and needs, we have launched a new fare—Basic economy—ideal 
for short trips or those traveling without baggage. 
Moreover, we recently launched a superior cab-
in class—Premium economy—which offers ex -
clusive services both at the airport and on board, 
and available on all our domestic and international 
flights operated with A320 family airplanes.
Another relevant milestone was the unification of 
our loyalty programs under the single brand LATAM 
Pass, which is not the fourth largest frequent flyer 
program in the world with over 30 million passen-
gers. In 2019 alone, our clients exchanged 7 million 
airplane tickets.
In an increasingly more digital world, we continue 
to invest in technology to improve our passengers’ 
experience and guarantee them greater autono-
my. In 2019, we reported a 30% increase in the use 
of our kiosks for checking in and printing boarding 
passes and bag tags. We are working to guarantee 
that the whole pre-boarding process can be 100% 
automated. We have already implemented a self 
bag drop system at some of the airports where we 
operate: São Paulo, Brasilia, and Rio de Janeiro in 
Brazil, London (England), Bogota (Colombia), and 
Quito (Ecuador).
Committed to connectivity, we launched 26 new 
routes in 2019, 12 of which are international. More-
over, we signed a strategic alliance with Delta Air 
Lines, which will help us to offer our passengers 
more flight options and shorter connection times 
through a Joint Business Agreement (JBA). However, our agreement with Delta is more than just a JBA. 
We will seek synergies to strengthen our process-
es and operations, and we will have greater finan-
cial flexibility following the sale and allocation of 
the purchase commitments for 14 A350 airplanes. 
Moreover, Delta acquired 20% of the LATAM shares, 
which strengthens the commitment to the success 
of this alliance. LATAM now has two large airlines as 
its partners: Delta Air Line and Qatar Airways.
These alliances with world-class airlines, such as 
Delta and Qatar, are a reflection of what we have 
built in the region in the last few years. We are a 
simpler, more efficient, and competitive organiza-
tion, ready to face the shifts of a dynamic market 
that is highly sensitive to the environment. The re-
sults of 2019 show resilience.
In my balance of the last year, I cannot forget to 
mention the social crises that some of the coun-
tries in the region are facing. Beyond looking at the 
challenges that they create for the business, we are 
constantly empathizing and understanding what is 
happening in our region.
From the economic point of view, we experienced 
a slowdown in the international aviation market 
in Latin America, influenced by a tough economic 
and social environment in the region. Nonetheless, 
LATAM ended the year with US$742 million in op-
erating income and an operating margin of 7 .1%, in 
line with Company expectations. Net profit reached 
US$190 million and our cash flow after invest -
ments settled at US$1.1 billion, which enabled us to maintain a healthy liquidity level and stable debt 
of around 4.0x.
We know that the Group’s sustainability is not de-
pendent solely on our financial soundness. In work-
ing on LATAM’s permanence in time, we also seek 
to contribute to the economic development of the 
regions where we operate, social progress, a re-
duction of the environmental effects of our activi-
ties, and preservation of the environment. Thus, we 
aim for our flight plan to be concrete contribution 
to make a more balanced and fairer world for all.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsFor the sixth consecutive time, we were acknowl-
edged as one of the three most sustainable airlines 
in the world, according to the Dow Jones Sustain-
ability Index (DJSI), and the only one in America to 
be included in the index. For the first time, we were 
also included in the FTSE4Good index series of the 
London (England) stock exchange’s Financial Times 
Stock Exchange (FTSE).
Another relevant milestone in 2019 was the new 
assessment we made of the Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals (SDG) to identify our contribution to 
the achievement of that global agenda. The analy-
sis revalidated LATAM’s most effective connection 
to seven of the 17 goals, and specifically, SDG 13, 
which regards the actions against climate change.Reducing the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) of 
the operation is the main goal of our strategy, and 
we are aligned to the most ambitious targets of 
the Paris Accord, with actions that aim to limit to 
1.5°C the rise in global temperature by the end of 
the century. We maintain a program devoted to the 
identification and implementation of fuel-use ef -
ficiency actions since 2010 and, as a result of the 
initiatives in the program, we avoided the consump-
tion of 60.6 million gallons of fuel in 2019, thus pre-
venting the emission of 578 thousand tons of GHG 
and reducing costs by around US$145 million.
As for responsible production and consumption, 
another goal of the UN agenda, we pioneered an 
in-flight recycling program, activated as a pilot pro-gram on domestic flights in Chile in 2019, and to 
be extended to our other operations in 2020. We 
wish to involve our clients in the matter, generat -
ing awareness that the preservation of the environ-
ment must be a shared task for all.
In the social axis, we celebrated 10 years of the 
“Care for My Destination” program, which devel -
ops sustainable tourism in various places around 
South America, an example of our commitment 
to the comprehensive development of the regions 
where we are present, through preservation and 
social development programs. With Solidary Plane 
Health and Solidary Plane Catastrophe, we place 
our connectivity and structure at the disposal of 
the demands of the communities in the region. 
Serving the healthcare needs, we become an air 
bridge connecting multidisciplinary teams and pa -
tients. In natural disaster situations, we assist the 
affected locations with humanitarian aid and team 
transportation.
In April 2020, I shall step down from the helm of 
LATAM after 25 years. I am proud of the long way 
we have come and I trust in what the future holds in 
store for us. I thank our shareholders for their trust 
during this time; clients, for choosing to fly with 
LATAM; and especially, our team of employees, for 
the great honor of leading them all these years. Ro-
berto Alvo, who has been with us for 18 years, shall 
take over as LATAM Group’s CEO. Roberto’s leader -
ship and knowledge of the industry will help us fly 
even further. I wish him the greatest success.The beginning of 2020 has been marked by the con-
sequences of the COVID-19, which fully challenges 
society, governments, and industries. The pandem-
ic is taking lives around the world, overloading the 
healthcare systems and affecting the economy. This 
outlook has led airlines to the most critical moment 
in their history. The scope and unpredictability of this 
crisis make it difficult to anticipate results, but we 
are acting quickly to ensure the Group’s long-term 
sustainability. This is the greatest crisis in history for 
the tourism and civil aviation sectors. Overcoming it, 
as an economic segment and as society, depends on 
adjustments beyond what any company can do indi-
vidually or even what the sector can do jointly, and it 
requires a union of public-private support.
Our trust in our work teams, the resilience that is 
our trademark, and the privilege of performing in an 
extraordinary region strengthen us to face the most 
challenging moment in the history of our company.
Let us carry on to go “Together, further” .

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsAs the main airline group in Latin America and one 
of the largest in the world, LATAM Airlines reaches 
145 destinations in 26 countries. In the passenger 
transportation business, it operates in the domes-
tic markets of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru, and various regional flights within 
South America, as well as long-haul flights to all 
five continents. Through its hubs in São Paulo/Gua-
rulhos (Brazil), Lima (Peru), and Santiago (Chile), 
it boosts its network of connections throughout 
South America, providing access to the most varied 
destinations. In 2019, the year of LATAM’s 90th an-
niversary, the company achieved a record number 
of transported passengers: 74.2 million. The cargo 
operation covers 152 destinations in 29 countries 
and transported 903.8 thousand tons in 2019.Based in Chile, LATAM has roughly 42 thou-
sand employees. In 2019, EBITDA (earnings be-
fore interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) 
reached US$2.21 billion, operating income settled 
at US$742 million, and net profit stood at US$190 
million. The Group’s stocks are traded on the Santi-
ago (Chile) and New York (US) stock exchange.
LATAM’s presence in the region, its well-defined 
business strategy, and its consistent results were 
essential to the structuring of the strategic alli-
ance with Delta Air Lines. This alliance comprises a 
commercial agreement, the contribution of US$350 
million related to transition costs to implement the 
agreement, the sale and transfer of fleet com-
mitments, and the recent acquisition of 20% of Historical record:

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsThe process of  
unifying the LA TAM brand 
remains underway. The Group 
ended 2019 with the new brand 
applied to 98% of the corporate 
identity with the greatest 
impact and highest visibility, 
such as hangars and buildings, 
and to 45.3% of the fleet.quency and connection possibilities), operational 
excellence and a unique and appealing program 
for its frequent flyers, in addition to customized 
services and products for each passenger profile. 
All this can only be achieved through employees’ 
effort, as they represent LATAM in most of the in -
teractions with customers.
In 2019, LATAM began a project to transform the 
cabins, which involves most of the planes in the 
fleet, with an investment totaling US$400 million 
by 2020. The initiative aims to improve the expe-
rience of passengers who seek for more comfort, 
particularly on long-haul flights, offer passengers 
in the main cabin more options, and enable LATAM 
to increase its offer of seats. The new cabin model 
has already been implemented in 67 airplanes, be-
ginning with LATAM Brazil and LATAM Peru.BENCHMARK IN CONNECTIVITY
 ►Leader in frequency: on 60% of the routes, 
measured in ASK1, LATAM is the leader in 
frequency compared to the other airlines op-
erating those routes.
 ►Broad destination network: LATAM offers 
services to over 80% of the passengers in the 
countries2 where it operates, either through 
direct or connecting flights, or via alliances.
 ►Better schedules: 1/3 of LATAM’s clients 
state that the main reason for flying with 
the airline is the quality of its itineraries, 
either in terms of flight schedules and/or 
more suitable routes (shorter and with fewer 
connections)3.

3 According to survey from 2019.STRATEGY: CUSTOMER FOCUS
In the last few years, LATAM has focused on a 
broad transformation process with the aim to make 
it more streamlined and efficient, ready to respond 
quickly and anticipate external changes.
After reducing costs, consolidating a more ef -
ficient business model, and achieving financial 
soundness, the Group is even more focused on its 
customer service, and on offering a better value 
proposition for the various client profiles: from 
passengers who travel frequently on business to 
those who choose LATAM for their first flight ever. 
LATAM’s goal is to provide customers with a fluid 
process without disruptions, and ensure that ev -
erything works as well as possible so clients can 
have the best experience, from the moment when 
they decide to travel and are going to purchase 
their ticket to the moment when they get off the 
plane. In practice, this commitment translates 
into maintaining and improving those features 
that are the main ones of the LATAM brand: its 
destination network and connectivity potential 
(offering more destinations, with greater fre -The Group also invests in technology, to make 
customers’ experience with the brand more prac -
tical and give passengers greater control of their 
trip. In 2019, LATAM made progress in the imple-
mentation of the self bag drop system, which en-
ables passengers to print out their bag tags, tag, 
and drop off their baggage, with assistance from 
a LATAM employee being available, if required. 
Transversally, technology also reaches the busi-
ness’ most varied areas and fronts, so it is essen-
tial for the Group to be able to operate an average 
of over 1,300 daily flights.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsParticularly regarding the destination and con-
nectivity network, LATAM launched 26 new routes 
during 2019. On the other hand, it agreed with Del-
ta Air Lines on the implementation of a Joint Busi-
ness Agreement (JBA), subject to regulatory ap-
proval, to better connect North and South America.
In turn, LATAM announced its exit from the 
oneworld alliance as of May 1st, 2020, which does 
not affect most of the bilateral agreements LATAM 
has with other airlines that remain in the alliance.On-time performance was another outstand-
ing figure in 2019. For the second consecutive 
year, LATAM was chosen as the most punctu-
al among the 20 main airlines in the world in 
number of scheduled flights, according to OAG 
(Official Airline Guide) and it came in fifth in 
the overall ranking. The Group was also ac -
knowledged as the most punctual in the world 
in the Global Airlines—Network category, ac -
cording to Cirium.AGREEMENT WITH DELTA AIR LINES
In September, LATAM Airlines and Delta Air 
Lines announced a strategic agreement that 
establishes a US$1.9 billion investment 
by Delta to acquire 20% of LATAM’s equity 
(equivalent to US$16 per share). The agree-
ment is an important acknowledgement of 
LATAM as a leading airline group in Latin 
America, proving the soundness of its busi-
ness model.
In addition to greater connectivity for cli-
ents, the agreement will provide opportu-
nities for synergies and the exchange of 
good practices in other areas, such as fleet, 
maintenance, technology, supplier man-
agement, and others. To cover the transi-
tion costs, Delta will contribute a total of 
US$350 million.One of the points of the agreement states 
that Delta will take on the commitment for 
the purchase of 10 LATAM A350 airplanes 
from Airbus, and the sale of 4 LATAM A350 
airplanes to Delta. For LATAM Group, this will 
result in an improvement in cash flow and in 
the capital structure, as well as in a reduc -
tion in future debt.
Once the regulatory requirements of the U.S. 
Department of Transportation, the local au-
thorities of Chile, Brazil, and other relevant 
South American authorities are fulfilled, it 
will open the possibility of combining two 
complementary networks between North 
and South America to offer greater connec -
tivity between these regions and with access 
to 435 destinations worldwide.LATAM Airlines:  
voted the most punctual  
among the 20 largest airlines 
in the world for the second 
consecutive year.

LATAM’s fleet comprises 342 airplanes, with 
an average age of under 9 years old. With the 
most modern models in each category, the fleet 
for long-haul flights has 80 airplanes, 13 of 
which are Airbus A350-900 and 26 are Boeing 
787 Dreamliner, versions 8 and 9. The models 
are worldwide benchmarks of efficiency in fuel 
consumption and the reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions and noise. Among the 250 air -
planes in the Airbus A320 family operating on 
domestic and regional flights in Latin America, 
we find the A320neo model, which consumes 
15% less fuel and generates 50% less noise than 
the equivalent model of the previous gener -
ation. The fleet is complete with another 12 
Boeing 767F airplanes of LATAM Cargo which, in 
a combined strategy, uses both the carriers and 
the cargo holds of the passenger planes.
In 2019, LATAM Airlines Brazil added to its fleet 
14 Airbus A320-200 airplanes to be used on the 
domestic market, operating mainly at the Gua -
rulhos (Sao Paulo) and Santos Dumont (Rio de 
Janeiro) airports, taking advantage of new op -
portunities in the Brazilian market.As part of the agreement signed with Delta Air 
Lines, the US airline took over the commitment 
of purchasing 14 of LATAM’s Airbus A350 air -
planes: four from the current fleet and ten that 
are included in the Group’s fleet plan commit -
ments, with deliveries scheduled as of 2020. The 
move contributes to the Group’s financial flexibil -
ity, with an improvement in cash flow, and it does 
not compromise its growth strategy, as LATAM 
maintains plane leases with third parties and con -
tinues to move forward with the cabin modern -
ization of a large part of its fleet, which includes 
increasing the number of seats per airplane.MAINTENANCE
LATAM has general maintenance, line, and com -
ponents facilities, all equipped and certified to 
service the Boeing and Airbus fleet. Its two Main -
tenance, Repair, and Operation (MRO) bases are 
responsible for the overall maintenance of the 
Group’s airplanes, in addition to servicing third 
parties on occasion. The MRO bases are also re -
sponsible for planning and executing the airplane 
returns, in line with the Group’s fleet plan.
The Chilean base is located near the Santiago In-
ternational Airport. It has the capacity to simulta-
neously service two narrow body aircrafts and one 
wide body airplane, and has auxiliary spaces, where 
activities to adapt cabin interiors, including install-
ing the entertainment systems, are carried out.
In Brazil, the maintenance base is located in São 
Carlos, within São Paulo, and it can service up to 
eight airplanes at the same time. The unit also 342
airplanes with an average age 
below 9 years and the most 
modern models in their category 
make up LATAM’s fleet.has over 30 stores for technical components, a 
hangar for stripping and painting, and a support 
engineering area, among others.
LATAM’s two MRO bases performed 425 main -
tenance services throughout the year, which 
translates into 71% of the total maintenance 
of the fleet; the remainder was left to ex -
ternal suppliers. The services performed on 
the company’s own units totaled 1,35 million 
man-hours worked.
The line maintenance network is distributed 
among LATAM’s hangars in Santiago (Chile); São 
Carlos, Congonhas/São Paulo, and Brasilia (Bra -
zil); Lima (Peru); Aeroparque/Buenos Aires (Ar -
gentina); and Miami (USA), among others. The 
network includes a series of automated and 
integrated services that ensure compliance with 
all safety requirements and local and interna -
tional regulations.

INTERNATIONAL MARKET
International passenger operations, which include 
regional flights between South and Central Amer -
ica and the long-haul flights to and from the five 
continents, stood for 44.8% of the Group’s total 
revenue in 2019. Considering only revenues from 
passengers, international flights stood for 50.6%. In 
the annual consolidated figure, 16.2 million peo-
ple traveled with LATAM to international destina-
tions—a 1.6% decrease from the previous year, 
when the Group transported 16,5 million passen-
gers on its international flights.Passenger demand, measured in RPK (revenue 
passenger kilometers), which is equivalent to the 
number of paid passengers transported, times 
the distance flown, increased 4.6% compared 
to 2018. Offer, measured in ASK (Available Seat 
Kilometers), equivalent to the number of seats 
available, times the distance flown, increased 
4.1% compared to the previous year. With these 
results, load factor rose 0.4 percentage points 
compared to 2018, settling at 83.5%.
In South America, LATAM operates an average of 
162 daily flights between the region’s countries, 
and has the largest market share in the region, with 
43.6%, followed by Avianca (19.3%), Gol (9.6%), 
and Aerolíneas Argentinas (8.7%). Of the 12 routes 
opened in 2019, three offer direct non-stop flights, 
from the Brazilian capital (Brasilia) to the capi-
tals of Chile (Santiago), Peru (Lima), and Paraguay 
(Asuncion). The Group also launched the São Paulo/
Guarulhos – Mount Pleasant and Concepcion (Chile) 
– Lima (Peru) flgiths, among other new routes.In 17 countries of North America, Europe, Asia, 
Africa, and Oceania, an average of 81 daily flights 
are operated by LATAM. Some examples are the 
São Paulo/Guarulhos (Brazil) – Las Vegas (US), 
Santiago (Chile) – São Paulo/Guarulhos (Brazil) 
– Tel Aviv (Israel) routes, which guarantees the 
Group’s presence in the Asian continent, and San -
tiago (Chile) – Melbourne (Australia).12 international routes 
opened in 2019.
AMERICA WORLD CUP
In order to meet the demand generated by 
the America Soccer World Cup, held in Brazil 
in June and July, LATAM adapted its oper -
ation of regional flights. For instance, it of -
fered 12 daily flights from Santiago (Chile) 
to the São Paulo/Guarulhos hub, and the 
host cities of Salvador de Bahia and Rio de 
Janeiro. LATAM Travel created special pack-
ages — including airfare and lodging — for 
five capitals where the games were held: 
São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador de Bahia, 
Porto Alegre, and Belo Horizonte.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsDOMESTIC MARKET
In 2019, 58 million people traveled on domes-
tic flights operated by LATAM Airlines Argentina, 
LATAM Airlines Brazil, LATAM Airlines Chile, LATAM 
Airlines Colombia, LATAM Airlines Ecuador, and 
LATAM Airlines Peru. This figure translates into 
10.8% growth over the total people (52.4 million) 
transported in 2018, and it was driven, particularly, 
by the Group’s domestic operations in Brazil—the 
largest market in South America. The gradual re-
covery of internal demand and the changes in the 
competitive environment of Brazil were the main 
factors that led to the increase in the total number 
of passengers transported by LATAM Brazil on do-
mestic flights during the period.
In 2019, the domestic passenger operation stood 
for 42.7% of LATAM’s total revenues, and 49.4% of 
passenger revenues. In the consolidated figure for 
the six countries, average passenger demand, mea-
sured in RPK, grew 9.3% compared to 2018, where-
as the offer, measured in ASK, increased by 8.9%, 
affecting the load factor, which rose 0.3 percentage 
points to settle at 81.8%.On average, 1,119 domestic flights per day can take 
off and land at over 100 airports; in Brazil alone, 
LATAM operates in 47 airports with an average of 
602 domestic flights daily. In Peru, the Group oper -
ates in 20 airports; in Chile, in 17 . LATAM is the mar -
ket leader in Peru, with a 63% market share, and in 
Chile, with 54%. In Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and 
Ecuador, it is the second largest operation.
The domestic destinations network was also ex -
panded in 2019. The flight from Santos Dumont, 
in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), to the city of Curiti -
ba (Brazil) was one of the 14 domestic routes 
launched in the year.LATAM CARGO
As the main air freight carrier group in Latin America, 
LATAM Cargo reaches 152 destinations in 29 coun -
tries. It has an exclusive cargo network with seven 
destinations — one in North America, two in South 
America, one in the Caribbean, and three in Europe—
in addition to all the other destinations operated by 
LATAM in the passenger transportation business.
Throughout the year, factors such as local cur -
rency devaluation against the USD, particularly in 
Brazil and Argentina, and the economic uncertain-
ty worldwide had a negative impact on imports 
markets and were reflected in the performance of LATAM Cargo. This result was partially countered 
by a better performance of the domestic and ex -
ports markets, mainly benefiting from salmon 
and flower exports. In the 2019 consolidated fig-
ure, revenues from cargo transportation stood for 
10.2% of LATAM’s total revenues. Cargo capacity 
fell 2.2%, whereas load factor was 0.3 percentage 
points higher than in 2018, settling at 55.5%.
In the year, 903.8 thousand tons of cargo were 
transported and satisfaction levels with the service 
rendered increased (see more in   Customers).
The Group remained focused on its business 
strategy, based on maximizing the use of the car -
go holds on passenger planes and complementing 
its offer with its freighter planes. Along that line, 
a milestone for the company was the increase of 
its fleet, totaling 11 freighter planes, after receiv-
ing two passenger planes overhauled into cargo 
planes in July and December, respectively, per an 
agreement signed with Boeing in late 2017 .
During 2019, the company worked on developing 
RESTART, its digital transformation project an-
nounced in 2018, whose goal is to reduce to one 
the various operating systems currently in use.14 domestic routes 
launched in 2019.

dard, express, and flex. In the express option, the 
cargo is marked as priority shipping. In the flex 
option, LATAM Cargo guarantees the delivery time, 
which ranges from two to seven business days, 
leaving open the route and type of plane to be 
used for transportation. This autonomy reduces 
operating costs and enables LATAM Cargo to of -
fer more competitive pricing. In order to meet the 
specificities of the domestic markets, the Group 
has similar and specific portfolios.Transportation of domestic animals
During 2019, LATAM updated its internal guidelines 
to improve the transportation of domestic animals, 
maintaining the commitment of guaranteeing the 
pet’s health, safety, and wellbeing, as well as the 
owner’s peace of mind. The goal is to standardize 
the experience of customers who hire the service, 
regardless of whether the pet travels in the cabin 
with the passenger or in the cargo hold. The revi-
sion included offering a greater volume of infor -
mation to pet owners, updating the rules of each 
country for this type of transportation, and homog-
enizing a new fare structure for the service, whose 
goal was also to standardize the experience.
Moreover, LATAM Cargo has joined the Interna-
tional Pet and Animal Transportation Association 
(IPATA), which will allow the Group to follow even 
more closely the discussions and best practices 
on the matter.NEW REFRIGERATED W AREHOUSE 
FOR PERISHABLE CARGO
In order to offer an even more specialized 
value proposition to the clients with per -
ishable cargo — e.g. flowers, salmon, and 
asparagus, among others—LATAM Cargo 
opened its new refrigerated warehouse with 
controlled temperature in its hub at the air -
port of São Paulo/Guarulhos, Brazil. The new 
Perishable Hub, as it is known, began opera-
tions on December 25, and translated into a 
33% increase in LATAM’s capacity to store this 
type of products in Guarulhos. With the new 
warehouse, the perishable shipments in tran-
sit remain in environments with controlled 
temperatures, which extends their freshness 
and safeguards their properties.
The cooler measures over 1,600 square me -
ters, half of which have refrigeration cham -
bers, divided into two spaces: in the first 
one, the temperature ranges from 0 to 2 
degrees, whereas in the second, it ranges 
from 2 to 12 degrees. The cooling system is 
adjustable and can reach 22 degrees, should 
there be a product that requires a different 
storage temperature.With the launch  
of the new perishable  
cargo warehouse in 
Guarulhos (Brazil), LATAM 
Cargo strengthens its value 
proposition for its clients.

As announced during 2018, LATAM completed, 
early in 2019, the acquisition of 27 .3% of Multi -
plus’ shares, which were held by minority share -
holders, following which it integrated Multiplus 
into LATAM Airlines Brazil. Later, in 2019, LATAM 
completed the process of unifying the loyalty 
programs. Both in Brazil and in Hispanic countries, 
relations with frequent flyers are now carried out 
through the LATAM Pass program, which stands 
as the fourth largest in the world, with close to 30 
million members.
According to the annual consolidated figure, 
7 million tickets were exchanged. The program offers other advantages to its affiliates, which 
vary based on the client’s category within the 
loyalty program, such as cabin upgrades and the 
offer of LATAM+ seats, with additional space and 
other comforts.
LATAM Pass operates four Elite categories: Plat-
inum, Gold, Black, and Black Signature.  In Brazil, a 
fifth category—Gold Plus—was launched in 2019, 
serving an intermediate range between the Gold 
and Platinum categories. It is designed for fre -
quent flyers on domestic flights, and it offers ad -
vantages such as: Priority Check-in and boarding; 
moving their flight to an earlier or later one on the 
same day, and upgrade coupons.LATAM PASS: MORE DIGITAL
Since the unification of the loyalty program, 
LATAM has been working on implementing, on 
the LATAM App and the website, a function that 
will enable clients to choose how they wish to 
pay for their ticket: with LATAM Pass miles, 
with money, or with a combination of both.
Since early 2019, LATAM has deployed a digital 
platform to store in a single site all the data 
generated in the various databases, which 
will enable the Group to make a more stra -
tegic use of the tools available, such as data 
analytics and artificial intelligence. Hosted in 
the cloud, this platform will be fed informa -
tion from the various areas of LATAM, and it 
will also be available, simultaneously, to all of 
them. The processing of these data makes it 
possible, for instance, to offer products that 
better fit the client profile, based on their his -
tory with LATAM or with the LATAM Pass fre -
quent flyer program.
The use of data analytics should also have a 
positive effect on the operation itself. The Digi-
tal Technology area is already developing mod-
els to identify in advance any delays in opera-
tions and reduce the impact on passengers.LATAM Pass: 7 million 
tickets were exchanged

LATAM Airlines Group is a publicly traded company, 
registered before Chile’s Financial Market Coun-
cil (CMF) under registration number 306, and its 
shares are traded on the Santiago Stock Exchange 
and the Chilean Electronic Stock Exchange. The 
Group’s stocks are also traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) as American Depositary 
Receipts (ADRs).The corporate governance practices are ruled by 
the provisions of Law No. 18,045 of the Securities 
Market, Law No. 18.046 on Stock Corporations, and 
the rules of the CMF in Chile. They are also ruled 
by the laws and regulations of the United States of 
America and its Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion (“SEC”), in addition to the specific regulations 
of the countries where LATAM operates.
The Group’s commitment to the best corporate 
governance and compliance practices involves all 
employees. A series of initiatives and instruments 
are adopted to guide the internal behavior, based 
on ethics, transparency, compliance, and integrity, 
as well as to ensure improvements in accountability 
processes and in the fight against illicit acts, such 
as corruption, bribery, monopolistic practices, and 
money laundering. Some examples of the Compli-
ance Program and the various corporate policies are 
provided below: • Compliance program: it covers various elements, 
such as top management’s commitment, the develop-
ment of specific policies, risk identification and man-
agement, monitoring and control processes, training, 
and communication. It guarantees all employees’ 
responsibility to comply with the applicable laws and 
standards. It is managed by the Legal Affairs and 
Compliance vice-presidency, with participation from 
the Management Board and the Directors’ Committee;
• Set of corporate policies (see chart);
• Manual for Handling Relevant Information: in 
addition to adhering to Chilean law 20,382 regarding 
Corporate Governance and the CMF’s regulations, this 
document regulates the disclosure of transactions, 
the voluntary quiet periods for trading LATAM’s stocks, 
the mechanisms for disclosing relevant information, 
and the processes to prevent leaks of confidential 
information by its employees and executives;
• Crime Prevention Manual: created in 2014, it is part 
of the Crime Prevention Model and defines the roles 
and responsibilities within LATAM to prevent crimes, 
considered under Chilean law n°. 20,393, which estab-
lishes legal entities’ liability;• Ethics Channel: platform to receive reports on 
breaches of laws and internal rules, such as breaches 
of the Code of Conduct, labor irregularities, discrim-
ination, moral and sexual harassment, fraud, corrup-
tion, and bribery, among others. Guaranteed to be 
confidential, the channel is managed by an external 
collaborator that performs the initial assessment of 
all records, guaranteeing impartiality. When nec -
essary, the cases are transferred to the Code of 
Conduct Management Committee in each country, 
which is comprised of representatives from various 
areas and ensures that the cases are channeled as 
required. [102-17]

Since 2016, the Policy for Monitoring Relat -
ed-Party Transactions has been in force, drafted 
per the Chilean Corporations Act and valid for the 
Group and its affiliates. The law states that all 
transactions of a public company with a related 
party must contribute to benefit society, be car -
ried out under market conditions, undergo as -
sessment by the Directors’ Committee, and then, 
be approved by the Management Board. LATAM’s 
policy also includes the definition of transactions 
considered as standard; that is, that do not re -
quire the Directors’ Committee to analyze them 
or the Board to approve them.
Transactions carried out in 2019 between LATAM 
and its subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements for the financial year ended on 
December 31, 2019. For further information, please 
refer to note 33 of the  Financial Statements.CORPORATE POLICIES [102-16]

2 Policy revised in 2019. TRAINING ON ETHICS AND INTEGRITY
Employees take periodic training on topics such 
as ethics, compliance, corruption prevention, and 
monopolistic practices. The contents are present -
ed in the new employee induction process and 
they are part of the annual training schedule for 
updating knowledge.
Periodic training on the specific contents of the 
Code of Conduct is mandatory. In 2019, 97 .4% of 
the employees, 95.5% of the executives, and all 
members of the Board completed the e-learning 
on the code, which includes a test to assess the 
training’s effectiveness. The percentage that have 
undersigned the LATAM anticorruption policies and 
procedures is 98% of the employees and 95.6% of 
the executives.
The anticorruption procedures apply to all the sup-
plier base. Contracts and purchase orders include 
information on the matter and the Supplier Code of 
Conduct that LATAM created in 2019. All 697 sup-
pliers that interact with government bodies on be-
half of LATAM (Third-party intermediaries or TPIs), 
who interacted with LATAM in 2019, countersigned 
the document.
Moreover, LATAM continues with its compliance  
Ambassadors project, where employees from var -
ious areas act as guardians of the program within 
their units, with the aim to divulge and generate 
awareness among their colleagues regarding the

The Policy on Political Contributions establishes 
the guidelines regarding financial aid to parties and 
candidates in each of LATAM’s countries of opera-
tion during electoral campaigns, regardless of the 
level of government. Contributions must adhere 
to current local legislation and be in line with the 
Group’s Code of Conduct. The Board, represented 
by the Executive Committee in such cases, must 
authorize the contribution. No contributions have 
been made since the policy was created, late in 
2016.  [415-1]
RELATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES  [102-40]
In Brazil, the aviation sector is regulated and super -
vised by the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC); 
in Chile, the main regulating agencies are the Gen-
eral Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) and the 
Civil Aviation Board (JAC). LATAM also interacts 
with public bodies and agencies that are not direct -
ly related to the activity of aviation, with dialogue 
and ethics as the guidelines for its relations. All 
meetings with authorities and regulatory agencies 
are recorded in a specific platform, monitored by 
the Compliance department.
[+] For further information on the Regulatory 
Framework, please refer to the  Appendices.Governance 
structure
[102-18]
The main governance body of LATAM Airlines Group 
S.A. is the Management Board, which has nine per -
manent members, elected individually for two-year 
periods through the cumulative vote system. Each 
shareholder has one vote per share and may cast 
all their votes in favor of a single candidate or dis-
tribute them among several. This practice ensures 
that shareholders of 10% of the shares on the mar -
ket may choose at least one representative.
The current Board was elected in the Ordinary 
Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 25, 2019. Its 
main duties are to define and follow the Group’s 
strategic guidelines. The Board holds regular 
monthly meetings and, whenever necessary, ex -
traordinary meetings. In 2019, members’ aver -
age attendance settled at 92.4%. Of the total 19 
ordinary and extraordinary Board meetings held 
throughout 2019, Nicolás Eblen Hirmas, Eduardo 
Novoa Castellón, and Patrick Horn García reported

Juan José Cueto Plaza, and Sonia Villalobos, in 18 
(94.7%); Henri Philippe Reichstul and Carlos Heller 
Solari, 17 (89.5%); and Giles Agutter 13 (68.4%).
As part of a self-assessment process, the Board 
members routinely fill out a form on best practic -
es, required by Chile’s Financial Market Commis -
sion (CMF, for its Spanish acronym).
Moreover, there is a Directors’ Committee, com -
prised by three Board members, that doubles as 
Audit Committee. This composition meets the re -
quirements of the Chilean Corporations Act (LSA, 
for its Spanish acronym), the standards of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the guidelines of the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
By December 31, 2019, the members of the Di -
rectors’ Committee, Eduardo Novoa Castellón, 
Nicolás Eblen Hirmas, and Patrick Horn García 
were considered independent, pursuant to article 
10A of the US Securities Exchange Act. For pur -
poses of Chile’s LSA, which requires that the Board 
include two independent members, Mr. Nicolás 
Eblen Hirmas is not considered to be an indepen -
dent board member.
In Chile, the requirements pertaining to board 
members’ independence are stated in the LSA and 
its latter amendments by Law N° 19,705, regard -ing the relationship between board members and 
the controlling shareholders of a company. A board 
member is considered independent when he or 
she has no links, interests, economic, professional, 
credit, or commercial dependence of any relevant 
nature or volume to the company, the other sub -
sidiaries of the Group, its controller, or the main 
executives, nor any family ties with the latter.
Among other functions, the Directors’ Committee 
is charged with assessing the reports by external 
auditors and other financial statements submitted 
to the Board, and proposing the engagement of 
external auditors and risk rating agencies, among 
other duties.
The Group’s governance structure also has four 
committees that assist the Board: Strategy, Lead -
ership, Finance, and Clients. Moreover, as a result of a Board agreement, a Risk Committee was cre -
ated to supervise the implementation of the risk 
pillar in LATAM’s strategic plan, and particularly, to 
supervise the Group’s risk management and en -
sure the structuring of a corporate risk matrix and 
its management.
The executive sphere is divided into four large 
areas: Clients; Operations and Maintenance; 
Commercial; and Finance, with clearly divided re -
sponsibilities to execute and monitor the Group’s 
strategy. To ensure a streamlined decision-mak -
ing, the executives in charge of these four ar -
eas, in addition to the vice-presidents of Legal 
and Compliance, and Corporate Affairs com -
prise an Executive Committee that acts together 
with the LATAM CEO. Holding weekly meetings, 
the Executive Committee also has the support 
of the vice-president of Human Resources and Four large segments  
comprise the executive  
sphere: Clients; commercial; 
operations and fleet; and finance.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsCOMPENSATION PLANS
Compensation plans implemented through the 
awarding of stock options to buy and pay for 
shares offered by LATAM Airlines Group S.A. to 
the employees of the Company and its affiliates 
are acknowledged in the Financial Statements 
pursuant to IFRS 2 “Share-Based Payments” . 
These plans report the effect of the fair value on 
the options awarded as a linear charge to remu -
nerations between the date when said options 
are granted and the date when they become 
irrevocable.
a) Compensation plan 2013—not valid at the 
present date
In the General Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meet -
ing held on June 11, 2013, the Company’s share -
holders approved, among other matters, the in -
crease in share capital, whereby 1,500,000 shares 
were destined to compensation plans for the 
workers of the Company and its affiliates, pursu -
ant to the provisions of Article 24 of the Chilean 
Corporations Act. On June 11, 2018, the period 
for buying such shares, which were not subscribed 
or paid, expired, thus fully reducing the capital.b) Compensation plan 2016-2018
The Company implemented a long-term retention 
plan for executives, lasting until December 2018, 
with a vesting period between October 2018 and 
March 2019, and consisting in an extraordinary 
bonus whose calculation formula is based on the 
value variation experienced by the shares of LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. during a given period.
This benefit is recorded pursuant to IFRS 2 “Stock-
Based Payment” and has been considered a 
cash-settled award, and therefore recorded at fair 
value as a liability, which is updated at the closing 
date of each Financial Statement, affecting the fis-
cal year’s profit or loss.
The fair value has been determined based on the 
best estimate of the Company’s shares’ future val-
ue, multiplied by the number of base units awarded.
By December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, 
the sum recorded was THUS$652 and THUS$7,735, 
respectively, classified under the line of “Admin-
istration expenses” in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet by function.Base units

From January 1 to December 31, 2019 1,592,777 - - - 1,592,777
c) LP2 Compensation plan (2019–2020) 
The Company implemented a long-term retention 
plan for executives, lasting until March 2020, with 
a vesting period between October 2019 and March 
2020, and consisting in an extraordinary bonus 
whose calculation formula is based on the value 
variation experienced by the shares of LATAM Air -
lines Group S.A. during a given period.
This Compensation plan has not been provisioned 
yet, as the callable stock price stands below the 
initial target.d) LP3 Compensation plan (2020–2023) 
The company implemented a program for a group of 
executives, lasting until March 2023, with a vest -
ing period between October 2020 and March 2023, 
where the collection percentage is annual an cumu -
lative. The methodology is an allocation of a number 
of units, where a target value is set for the stock. 
The bonus is activated if the price target of the 
stock, defined each year, is met. Should the bonus 
be accrued, until the last year, the total shall be 
doubled (if the stock price is activated).

With regard to dividends, the Company has de-
clared that they must be equal to the minimum 
required by law; that is, 30% of the profits, per 
current regulation. This does not prevent dividends 
above said mandatory minimum eventually being 
paid, depending on the specificities and factual cir -
cumstances that may be perceived throughout the 
year. Looking ahead, the Company does not expect 
changes in the dividend policy.
On May 16, 2019, the Company paid a total divi-
dend of US$54,580,443.06, charged to the profits 
from 2018.

The Corporate Finance Department is responsible 
for managing the Company’s Financial Policy. This 
Policy makes it possible to effectively face changes 
in conditions outside the business’ normal opera-
tion and thus maintain and anticipate a stable flow 
of funds to ensure the operation’s continuity and 
the fulfillment of our financial obligations.
Moreover, the Finance Committee, comprising 
the Executive Vice-Presidency and members of 
LATAM’s Board, meets periodically to review and 
propose to the Board the approval of issues that 
are not regulated by the Financial Policy. LATAM 
Airlines Group’s Financial Policy aims to achieve the 
following goals:
• To preserve and maintain suitable cash flow levels to 
ensure the requirements of the operations, to support 
growth, and to fulfill the Group’s financial obligations. • To maintain a suitable level of credit lines with local 
and foreign banks to gain access to additional liquidity 
to face contingencies.
• To maintain an optimal debt level, diversify financing 
sources, manage the debt maturity profile, and mini-
mize the cost of financing.
• To capitalize excess cash flow through financial in-
vestments that will guarantee a risk and liquidity level 
consistent with the Financial Investment Policy.
• To reduce the effects of market risks, such as varia-
tions in fuel prices, exchange rates, and interest rates 
on the Company’s net margin and cash position.
• To reduce counterparty risk through the diversifica-
tion and limits on investments and transactions with 
counterparties.• To maintain, at all times, a long-term visibility of the 
Company’s projected financial situation to anticipate 
situations of low liquidity, deterioration of the finan-
cial ratios agreed with rating agencies, etc.
• The Financial Policy provides guidelines and restric -
tions to manage Liquidity and Financial Investment 
transactions, Financing Activities, and Market Risk 
Management.
LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL  
INVESTMENT POLICY
During 2019, LATAM Airlines Group maintained 
adequate liquidity levels, in order to safeguard 
from potential outside shocks and the volatility 
and cycles of the industry itself, ending Decem-
ber 2019 with a liquidity ratio of 19.7% over total 
sales for the last 12 months. This liquidity in-
cludes a revolving credit line committed for a total 
of US$600 million from 12 local and international 
financial institutions, and which, at the end of the 
period, was fully available. Moreover, during 2019, 
a significant part of the pre-delivery payments, re -
lated to the Boeing and Airbus aircraft that LATAM 
will receive in the future, was financed with the 
Company’s own resources.With regard to the Financial Investment Policy, 
the goal is to centralize investment decisions to 
optimize profitability, adjusted for currency risk, 
subject to maintaining suitable security and li-
quidity levels. Moreover, the aim is to manage risk 
through the diversification of counterparties, ma-
turities, currencies, and instruments.
FINANCING POLICY
The scope of LATAM’s Financing Policy is to cov-
er the Company’s financing needs, including the 
acquisition of fleet assets, such as aircraft and 
engines, financing non-fleet investments, and fi-
nancing working capital.
During 2019, the Company had broad access to 
the international and local capitals markets, is -
suing debt with the lowest spreads in LATAM’s 
history. In February 2019, the Company issued 
unsecured bonds on the international market to -
taling US$600 million with a maturity of 7 years 
at a rate of 6.875%. On June 6, 2019, LATAM 
issued on the local Chilean market long-term 
unsecured bonds worth UF 5,000,000 with a 
10-year maturity at a UF coupon rate of 3.60%. 
The placement rate in UF was 2.73%, equiva -
lent to a sum placed of around US$215 million. 
Later, in July 2019, the Company held a reopen -
ing worth US$200 million on the bond issued in 
February of the same year, maturing in 2026 at a 
placement rate of 5.979%.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsMoreover, the Company has a committed credit line 
with a 12-bank consortium for US$600 million that 
is fully available. This line is subject to the avail-
ability of the collateral consisting of aircrafts, spare 
engines, and overall spare parts.
Most of the recurring investments made by LATAM 
Airlines Group are related to the fleet acquisition 
programs. Normally, LATAM finances between 70% 
and 85% of the value of the assets through bank 
loans, bonds covered by the export promotion agen-
cies, or covered bonds such as EETC, where the re-
maining part is funded through commercial loans, 
capital investments, or the Company’s own funds.
The payment schedules of the various aircraft fi-
nancing structures are mostly for 12 years. More-
over, LATAM contracts a large part of its fleet pur -chase commitments through operating leases as an 
additional source of financing.
During 2019, LATAM financed the acquisition of 
aircraft via a combination of JOLCO structures 
(Japanese Operating Lease with Call Option), oper -
ating leases, and own funds.
As for short-term financing, at December 31, 
2019, LATAM held around 5% of its total debt in 
loans to exporters and importers to finance work-
ing capital needs.
Another of the Financing Policy’s goals is to ensure 
a stable debt maturity and leasing commitment 
profile, including debt servicing and the payments 
on fleet leasing, which is consistent with LATAM’s 
operating cash flow.MARKET RISK POLICY
Given the nature of its operations, LATAM Airlines 
Group is subject to market risks, such as: (i) fuel 
price risk, (ii) interest rate risk, and (iii) exchange 
rate risk. In order to hedge fully or partially against 
these risks, LATAM uses financial derivatives to 
reduce the adverse effects that these risks could 
cause. Market Risk is managed integrally and con-
siders the correlation with each market factor to 
which the Company is exposed. In order to operate 
with each counterpart, the Company must have an 
approved line and a framework signed with it.
Fuel price risk: Variations in fuel prices depend sig-
nificantly on oil supply and demand in the world, as 
well as on the decisions made by the Organization 
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the refining capacity worldwide, inventory levels, and 
the occurrence or absence of climatic phenome-
na or geopolitical factors. LATAM purchases aircraft 
fuel, known as Jet Fuel. In order to execute fuel 
hedges, there is a benchmark index on the interna-
tional market for this core asset, which is Jet Fuel 
54 US Gulf Coast. This index was mainly used by 
LATAM Airlines Group for its hedges during 2019. 
LATAM also undertook hedging through NYMEX 
Heating Oil, whose core index is included in the Fuel 
Risk Hedging Policy, given the high correlation be-
tween this core index and Jet Fuel 54.
The Fuel Hedging Policy sets a minimum and a 
maximum hedging range for the Company’s fuel 
consumption, based on the capacity to pass 
through fuel price variations to airfares, anticipated 
sales, and the competitive scenario. Moreover, this 
Policy sets hedging zones, a premiums budget, and 
other strategic restrictions that are assessed and 
presented periodically before the LATAM Finance 
Committee.
With regard to fuel hedging instruments, the Policy 
makes it possible to contract combined Swaps and 
Options only for hedging purposes, and does not 
allow the net sale of options.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2019
Presentation  |  Highlights  |  Message from the CEO  |  Who we are  |  Corporate governance  |  Sustainability  |  Our business 
Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsInterest rate risk: Interest rate variations depend 
largely on the state of the global economy. An 
improvement in the long-term economic outlook 
pushes long-term rates upwards, whereas a drop 
causes a decline due to market effects.
However, considering government intervention, 
during periods of economic contraction, reference 
rates are usually cut in order to boost aggregate 
demand by making credit more affordable and 
increasing production (just as there are hikes in 
the reference rates during periods of economic 
expansion).
The uncertainty surrounding how the market and 
the governments will behave, and thus, how the 
interest rate will change, leads to a risk related to 
LATAM’s debt subject to variable interest, its in-
vestments, and the new issuances it may make. 
Interest rate risk on existing debt materializes in 
the impact on future cash flows related to finan-
cial instruments, given the interest rate fluctua-
tions. Thus, a higher interest rate could translate 
into a higher cash flow from interest payments, 
and vice versa. 
LATAM’s exposure to the risk from market interest 
rate fluctuations is mainly related to long-term ob-
ligations with variable rates.
In order to reduce the risk from an eventual hike in 
interest rates, LATAM Airlines Group has interest rate swap contracts. At December 31, 2019, the 
market value of interest rate derivatives positions 
totaled US$2.7 million (positive).
The instruments approved in the Interest Rate 
Hedging Policy are interest rate Swaps and Options.
Exchange rate risks: The functional currency used 
by the parent Company is the US dollar. There are 
two types of exchange risks: Cash flow and bal -
ance sheet risks. Cash flow risk is a consequence 
of the net revenue position and costs in curren -
cies other than US dollars. LATAM sells most of 
its services in US dollars, in prices equivalent to 
the US dollar and the Brazilian Real. Roughly 57% 
of revenues are US dollar-denominated, where -
as around 30% are denominated in Brazilian Reals. 
A major part of expenses is denominated in US 
dollars or equivalent to the USD, particularly fuel 
costs, aviation taxes, aircraft leases, insurance, and 
aircraft components and accessories. Compensa -
tion expenses are denominated in local currencies. 
The total percentage of USD-denominated costs is 
around 63%, while the rough percentage of costs in 
Brazilian Reals is about 18%.
LATAM Airlines Group does its international car -
go and passenger business mostly in US dollars. A 
share of the fares from the international passen-
ger business is closely correlated to the Euro. In the 
domestic business, most fares are in local curren-
cy without any sort of indexation to the US dollar. As for the domestic business in Peru and Ecuador, 
both airfares and sales are in USD. Thereby, LATAM 
is exposed to the fluctuations in various currencies, 
but mainly the Brazilian Real. LATAM Airlines Group 
has hedged against exchange rate risks involving 
the Brazilian Real mainly through forwards con-
tracts and currency options during 2019. At De-
cember 31, 2019, LATAM has hedges for the Brazil-
ian real worth US$15 million for 2020, with a view 
to establish a lager hedge during the year.
On the other hand, balance sheet risks appear when 
entries in the balance sheet are exposed to ex -
change rate fluctuations, given that said entries are 
expressed in a currency unit other than the func -
tional currency. While LATAM may sign hedging de-
rivatives contracts to protect against the impact of 
a potential currency appreciation or depreciation vs. 
the functional currency used by the parent Com-
pany, during 2019, LATAM made no hedges against 
balance sheet risk.The main mismatch factor is seen in TAM S.A., 
whose functional currency is the Brazilian Real, and 
as most of its liabilities are stated in US dollars, 
even though its assets are stated in local currency.
This imbalance decreased significantly during 2019, 
thus minimizing this risk. Specifically, the gap be-
tween TAM’s assets and liabilities decreased to 
roughly US$100 million, which translates into a de-
crease of around US$700 million.

sustainable
For LATAM, being sustainable means connecting its 
passengers and its destinations in all five conti-
nents, maintaining a balance between economic 
development, social progress, and environmental 
protection, creating value for all its stakeholders. 
That commitment translates into concrete initia-
tives, backed by the Group’s sustainability strate-
gy, Together, more sustainable, which guides the 
course of business based on an integrated view of 
the economic, social, and environmental spheres.The strategy comprises three dimensions:
• Governance: the company informs its stakeholders 
transparently of its commitments and obligations;
• Climate change: the company focuses on identi-
fying opportunities and mitigating the current and 
potential environmental risks and impacts of the 
operation, focused on managing the carbon footprint;
• Corporate citizenship: the company focuses on the 
development of sustainable tourism and on minding 
the healthcare needs of the low-income communities.
In its sustainability management, the Group resorts 
to the concepts of interdependence and coopera-
tion with different groups.
In 2019, for the sixth consecutive year, LATAM Air -
lines Group was chosen as one of the three most 
sustainable airlines in the world according to the World category—the most important one in the 
Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). (More infor -
mation on page 49.)
EVERYONE’S COMMITMENT AT LATAM
As with all the fundamental aspects of the busi -
ness, the Board also supervises the progress made 
in sustainability. The members receive periodic in -
formation on the progress achieved on the initia -
tives and the performance regarding goals, and they 
can direct new actions or review the planned course.LATAM remains 
committed to generate 
results with purpose.The Executive Committee directs the execu -
tion of the business strategy. Its work covers 
the financial and non-financial dimensions 
transversally across different areas, to enable 
an expanded vision of risks and opportunities.
Sustainability also has a direct effect on the 
variable compensation of both the teams and 
top management. Bonus payments are linked 
to the achievement of goals on three levels, 
related to the topics deemed most relevant 
for the management of sustainability.
The absence of aviation accidents in the pe -
riod is the goal of the first level, and what 
defines the payment of variable compensa -
tion. The second-level goals are corporate, 
transversal to the business, whose fulfillment 
depends on the performance of different ar -
eas. These goals may vary based on the area 
of the employee or executive, and they are 
linked to security, punctuality, customer sat -
isfaction, organizational climate and commit -
ment, financial performance, and cost effi -
ciency and productivity. 
At the third level, the goals are set by each 
area of operation, and those related to indi-
vidual performance. Nonetheless, some topics 
overlap; for instance, workplace security. As of 
2018, executives’ variable annual compensation 
in all areas became conditioned to the perfor -
mance of the Group’s occupational injury rate.

LATAM’s actions in sustainability are based on the corresponding corporate policy, approved by the 
Board in 2016. The document gathers the principles that the executives must use as reference in 
defining and executing the sustainable development strategies and initiatives.
The policy bolsters the transparency of the decision-making processes and the commitment to 
accountability, as well as collaboration with risk management. The document was drafted follow-
ing the guidelines included in various external standards, commitments, and principles. The main 
ones are: 
 ►Global Compact: a United Nations Organiza-
tion (UN) initiative to encourage the adop-
tion of corporate responsibility practices in 
the fields of human rights, labor rights, the 
environment, and anti-corruption. LATAM 
Airlines is part of this initiative, as well as of 
the Executive Committee. 
 ►Sustainable Development Goals: glob-
al development agenda promoted by the 
UN, which defines 17 goals and 169 targets 
related to the eradication of poverty, food 
security, health, education, gender equali-
ty, reduction of inequality, energy, climate 
change, sustainable cities, and inclusive eco-
nomic growth, among other topics.  ►Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights: they set a guideline of the parame-
ters and directives to ensure the protection, 
respect, and redress of human rights in the 
business world.
 ►Global Reporting Initiative (GRI): interna-
tional multisectoral organization committed 
to standardization and ongoing improvement 
in sustainability management and commu-
nication at companies and organizations of 
different sizes and sectors. Responsible for 
creating the benchmark sustainability re-
porting methodology for companies and or -
ganizations worldwide. The management of 
sustainability is based on the 
corporate policy regarding it, 
in force since 2016.

LATAM Airlines’ main stakeholders are employees, 
clients and passengers, suppliers, shareholders and 
investors, communities, civil society organizations, 
sectoral organizations, regulating agencies, and 
public institutions. With all of them, the relation-
ship management, which takes place through dif -
ferent contact and communication channels, and 
in line with precepts of dialogue and transparency, 
seeks to boost the commitment to generate and 
share value. At various times, the Group shares its 
agenda of strategic topics with those groups, well 
aware that , with their commitment and support, it 
is possible to achieve results with a greater impact 
for society overall.
Seeking a strategic dialogue and the development 
of the sector, LATAM also holds permanent dialogue 
with various organizations and is a member of vari-
ous sector representative agencies. In 2019, the fi-
nancial contributions to these associations totaled 
US$1.7 million. Associação Brasileira das Empresas 
Aéreas (ABEAR), International Air Transport Asso-
ciation (IATA), Asociación de Transporte Aéreo de 
Colombia (ATAC), and Chile’s Sociedad de Fomento 
Fabril (SOFOFA, for its Spanish acronym) received 
the largest contributions in the year.
The full list of the associations in which LATAM par -
ticipates is found in the  Appendices.CLIENT PERCEPTION
Early in November, the Group performed a 
survey among its clients in the six countries 
where it operates to find out this public’s per -
ception of the way in which LATAM manages 
sustainability. Over 13,600 people answered 
the survey.
To the questions regarding what sustainability 
topics LATAM should focus more on, 39% men-
tioned social responsibility, 30% ethics and 
anticorruption, and 23% climate change and 
waste management. Specifically regarding CO2 
emissions generated by the aviation industry’s 
activities, 41% of the participants stated that 
they are concerned about the emissions gen-
erated during their airplane travel.
The survey is one of the initiatives to involve 
clients in the management of sustainability 
and lead them to learn more about the man-
agement of all the areas of this topic within 
the Group.Strategic 
focus
 
To enable the identification of the priorities in the 
management of sustainability, the setting of goals, 
and monitoring of results, LATAM prioritizes and 
lists the most relevant topics for the business and 
its stakeholders. That definition is based on ma-
teriality studies, updated periodically to guarantee 
their alignment to the business strategy and exter -
nal context.
To determine the most relevant topics, LATAM 
takes into account the operation’s (current and po-
tential) impacts on its different stakeholder groups, 
these groups’ perceptions and expectations, 
LATAM’s vision of the future and its commitments, 
as well as global trends, and aviation industry and 
sustainability guidelines. The description of the 
current materiality process is on page 108.

The aviation industry is 
highly regulated; deviations 
and breaches may affect or 
prevent operations.The main achievements on this topic are not 
measured using numeric indicators, but they 
reflect the quality of the strategic dialogue 
for the sector’s development, described 
on page 30.Relations with authorities, regulatory bodies, representative 
agencies, and other industry agents favor the generation 
of solutions for common challenges—in the segments of 
logistics, mobility, and infrastructure, for instance—and

 LATAM   Industry averageBEST IN CLASS
The methodology adopted by the DJSI is 
known as Best in Class, and analyzes only the 
performance of the main public companies in 
the various sectors throughout the year. The 
evaluation criteria include issues of gover -
nance and compliance management, customer 
relations management, and long-term eco-
nomic and financial, social, and environmental 
practices. SAM CSA, an investment consulting 
firm specializing in sustainability, property of 
S&P Global, is in charge of the analysis, which 
results in a final list with the leading organiza-
tions in the abovementioned issues.DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX
With the priority issues defined and the actions 
guided, LATAM monitors its evolution on each of 
the sustainability fronts. This monitoring espe-
cially considers the Group’s performance in the 
Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), which has 
consolidated as the main international bench-
mark used by investors to assess the sustain-
ability practices and results of large organiza-
tions. One of the index’s characteristics is to 
showcase the performance of a company com-
pared to its peers in the same sector.
In 2019, for the sixth consecutive year, LATAM 
Airlines was chosen as one of the three most 
sustainable airlines in the world, according to 
said Index, which is comprised by 10% of the 
companies in Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Global 
Broad Market Index with the best performance in sustainability, and it is based on an indepen-
dent annual assessment of companies’ econom-
ic, social, and environmental criteria.
In 2019, the DJSI invited 3,517 companies in 61 
industries and 47 countries, which displayed the 
best financial performance measured by market 
capitalization in the S&P Global Broad Market 
Index, to participate in its annual corporate sus-
tainability evaluation. Of the 18 airlines invit -
ed, LATAM Airlines Group was the only one in 
America to qualify for the DJSI’s World catego-
ry. Moreover, the company is the leader of the 
airline index in the MILA Pacific Alliance (which 
measures 30% of the companies listed in the 
S&P with the best performance in Chile, Colom-
bia, Mexico, and Peru) and it is also part of the 
Chile index.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsPRESENCE IN OTHER INDICES
For the first time, the company is part of the 
series of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 
(FTSE) indices of the London exchange. This 
sustainability index was created in 2001, with 
the collaboration of the United Nations Inter -
national Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) 
and Ethical Investment Research Service 
(EIRIS).
To select the companies that are part of this 
index, roughly 300 indicators grouped around 
14 topics are assessed, which measure com-
panies’ performance in environmental, social, 
and governance issues (ASG).
The FTSE4Good indices are used by a wide 
range of market participants to create and 
advise responsible mutual funds and other 
products.REGARDING HUMAN RIGHTS
LATAM’s understanding of human rights is in line 
with the United Nations Organization’s concept, 
which sees human rights as inherent to all hu-
man beings, whatever the race, gender, nationality, 
ethnic origin, language, religion, or any other status. 
The definition considers the right to life, liberty, to 
be free of slavery or torture, freedom of expres-
sion, work, and education, among others.
In addition to running the business based on the 
precepts of ethics and integrity and adhering to all 
relevant legislation in the various countries where it 
operates, LATAM has a clear position on the topic, 
and seeks to make progress year after year on its 
efforts to foster the respect for human rights and 
non-discrimination within and outside the compa-
ny, as well as to improve the processes of identify-
ing, preventing, and mitigating the risks of human 
rights violation.
In 2019, the Declaration of Commitment on Hu -
man Rights was approved; it systematizes the 
precepts that the Group has already adopted in 
its operations and relations, reiterating its stance 
on the matter and establishing the consequenc -
es in case of noncompliance by employees and 
business partners. Among the principles defined in 
the declaration are rejection of child labor, bonded 
labor, and slave labor, and of situations of moral, 
physical, and sexual harassment; and the commit -
ment to union freedom, to the health and safe -
ty of the Group’s professionals, and to fair com -pensation and adequate work conditions for all 
employees, regardless of gender, race, age, sexual 
preference, and nationality, among others.
The parameters of this document are the main in -
ternational standards on human rights, such as the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United 
Nations Charter, and the Fundamental Principles 
and Rights at Work of the World Trade Organiza -
tion (WTO).
Simultaneously with the creation and release of 
the declaration, LATAM drafted a risk matrix spe -
cifically on human rights, which enables the iden -
tification, quantification, and prioritization of risks, 
as well as the adoption of mitigation measures.
LATAM Peru was the first affiliate to complete the 
risk analysis, using that matrix, which classified 
the risks into four levels, based on the degree of 
impact and likelihood of incidence: low, medium, As part of the 
management of human 
rights, LATAM approved in 
2019 the Compensations 
Policy, which bolstered 
the Group’s commitment 
regarding salary equality.

plans were defined, including, among others: an-
nual monitoring of compliance with the Group’s 
salary equality guidelines, revision of the process -
es to ensure impartiality and prevent discrimina -
tion in selecting suppliers, drafting a specific poli -
cy on sexual harassment in LATAM Peru, activation 
of a committee on the issue, and sharing informa -
tion among the teams and executives.
Gradually, the Group’s other operations performed 
their analysis, using the risk matrix as the base, 
which will enable LATAM to improve its manage -
ment of this issue.
Ensuring that its suppliers also respect human rights 
is an ongoing concern for the Group. In addition to 
the declaration, the topic is specified in the Code of Conduct for Suppliers, launched in 2019, the LATAM 
Code of Conduct, and in other internal policies and 
standards. As part of a preventive management, the 
analyses of suppliers to identify sustainability risks 
include issues of human rights, decent work, and 
ethical conduct (read more on page 66).Alignment 
with the SDG
Since its launch in 2015, LATAM supports the Unit -
ed Nations’ (UN) global agenda on Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG), and seeks to contribute 
to the achievement of the goals established in the 
commitment. The agenda has established the year 
2030 as the deadline to comply with the 169 goals.
In 2019, LATAM held a new assessment of the 17 
SDGs and their 169 targets, renewing the topics on 
which the Group will focus its efforts in the next 
few years. Of the 17 goals, seven are more direct -
ly linked to the nature of LATAM’s operation and 
activity, as these are the goals to which the Group 
can contribute most effectively, given that it al-
ready has the corresponding commitments and 
initiatives. These are: affordable and clean energy; 
decent work and economic growth; industry, inno-
vation, and infrastructure; responsible consumption 
and production; climate action; and life on land.The Group also has a 
specific risk matrix 
regarding human 
rights; LATAM Peru was 
the first affiliate to 
complete its assessment 
based on the matrix.

context
 
 
Economic activity growth in 2019 was mainly af -
fected by the tensions in foreign trade and by the 
decreases in economic activity within emerging 
markets, such as the case of India. On the plus 
side, it is worth noting the positive impact of more 
expansionary monetary policies on growth, which 
have been adopted transversally by the various au-
thorities, the positive news regarding trade negoti-
ations between the US and China, and the decrease 
in fears surrounding Brexit.
On the other hand, revenues from the global avia-
tion industry showed a good overall performance 
during 2019, driven by growth in demand (4.2% 
measured in RPK), despite being a slower rate than 
in the previous year (7 .4%), and aided by a 0.7 per -
centage-point rise in the load factor, reaching a 
new record high of 82.6%.These results are in contrast with the increase in 
industry costs, mainly in fuel. Thus, the global in-
dustry’s operating profit is estimated at US$42.5 
billion (below the US$45.9 billion achieved in 
2018), whereas net profit is estimated to have 
reached US$25.9 billion (below the US$27 .3 billion 
reported in 2018).
As for the various geographic markets, US airlines 
showed the best results in terms of profitability, 
despite having more moderate growth and a slower 
economic environment, as well as a more deteri-
orated business environment than in the previous 
year. Nonetheless, carriers benefited from their 
capacity discipline, managing to increase their load 
factor to 84.9%.In Europe, international growth experienced a slow-
down vs. the previous year (4.4% vs. 7 .5% in 2018), 
as a result of the economic slowdown in the region, 
industrial problems (strikes), the uncertainty re-
garding Brexit, and the collapse of several airlines.
Demand in Asia-Pacific was strongly affected, 
mainly by the trade tensions between China and the 
US, and by the weakening of the economic environ-
ment, growing 4.5% (compared to 8.5% in 2018).
In Latin America, passenger traffic grew 4.2% YOY 
(year over year), in line with the global market in 
2019. The protests held throughout the region and 
the economic turmoil in various countries led to a 
slowdown in international traffic for Latin American 
carriers. Total traffic in the region grew at a more 
moderate pace than in the previous year, increas-
ing by 4.2% , and showing a 1 percentage-point 
improvement in the load factor, to settle at 82.6%. 
The airlines in the region showed varying results 
throughout 2019, marking the year with a loss of 
US$400 million, compared to the US$800 million 
loss from a year earlier.
Given the industry’s current structure, the Inter -
national Air Transport Association (IATA) expects 
better net profits for the world’s aviation industry 
in 2020, which should settle around US$29.3 bil-
lion, with an operating margin of 5.5%. This im-
provement is explained by a stabilization of growth 
in demand at around 4.1%, as a result of a more stable global economy and an increase in glob-
al growth. Moreover, with regard to costs, they are 
expected to increase at a slower pace than in pre-
vious years, mainly due to a decline in fuel prices, 
partly countered by a rise in fuel consumption.
Last, the emerging economies, namely Asia-Pacific, 
the Middle East, and Latin America, are expected to 
remain as the growth engines of global traffic over 
the next 20 years.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsCHALLENGES OF THE INDUSTRY IN THE REGION
Commercial aviation has consolidated as a key ele-
ment in the current global economic system, given 
its role in the growth of foreign trade and invest -
ment, the development of tourism, and people’s 
connectivity across all the continents. Flying has 
become a more commonplace form of transporta-
tion, and it has even come to compete with ground 
transportation on domestic routes. The availabili-
ty and integration of technology in the processes, 
passengers’ ability to manage their own flights, and 
airlines’ efforts to transfer to passengers all cost 
efficiencies to reduce airfares have contributed to 
make Latin America one of the regions with the 
highest growth potential for aviation in the world. 
According to IATA estimates, air traffic will double 
in the region by 2035.
In this context, the aviation industry faces great 
challenges that call for a public-private effort to 
boost airlines’ growth and deliver a better travel 
experience.
The existence of a governmental leadership that 
coordinates the challenges of the aviation indus-
try and contributes to a reduction in the total cost 
of traveling—such as efficient public transporta-
tion to connect cities and airports—more passen-
ger-friendly terminals, with technology to stream-
line the processes, and an airport model focused 
on passengers’ travel experience, are some of the 
great challenges that LATAM as an industry must 
continue to tackle in the region.To contribute to the achievements, LATAM takes 
part and drives the main discussions affecting the 
sector by participating in various forums and en-
trepreneurial organizations. One of the main fo-
cuses is airport infrastructure. In 2019, the Santi-
ago airport (Chile), where one of LATAM’s hubs lies, 
made significant deliveries in its expansion works. 
It is expected that, by mid-2020, the Lima airport 
will complete the tender on its new works, which 
will enable it to double capacity over the next 20 
years. As for the airports of Argentina, Colom-
bia, and Peru, work is being done jointly with the 
Authorities to solve the capacity problems. At the 
airports undergoing expansions, LATAM is in talks 
with the concessionaires and relevant authorities 
to ensure that the works cause passengers the 
least disturbance possible. 
Other relevant issues for the industry regard the 
necessary infrastructure to guarantee passengers 
easy access to airports, which are normally far from 
urban centers, and other costs that make travel 
more expensive.
In Brazil, issues related to jet fuel prices or certain 
limitations that do not allow the aviation industry 
to develop as aggressively as in other countries in 
the region. In early 2019, the São Paulo govern-
ment cut to less than half (from 25% to 12%) the 
tax on jet fuel. 
In Argentina, LATAM made a significant achieve-
ment in the year. The relevant authorities approved the interchange, which allowed the Group the shared 
use of fleet from Chile to make its operations in 
the former country more efficient.
LATAM also monitors regulatory discussions on 
environmental topics, where Colombia has been 
a leader in these types of initiatives on a regional 
level (see more on page 83).Financial 
results
During 2019, LATAM proved that it is the best-posi-
tioned airline group in Latin America to capitalize on 
the region’s potential growth. Despite the challeng-
ing market conditions caused by the devaluation 
of local currencies and the social uprisings in the 
region, the group transported 74 million passengers 
in the year—a 5.4 million increase compared to 
the previous year. No other group in the region has 
grown as much in the number of passengers trans-
ported as LATAM.
In 2019, LATAM launched 26 new routes, strength-
ening the group’s connectivity at its main hubs of 
Sao Paulo, Lima, and Santiago. In turn, it launched 
the direct flight between Santiago and Sidney, as 
well as a new destination—Montego Bay, Jamai-
ca—which connects directly with Lima through 
LATAM Airlines Peru. LATAM Airlines Brazil launched 
12 new domestic routes, mainly from Guarulhos 
(Sao Paulo) and Santos Dumont (Río de Janeiro).
The focus we have given to operating excellence 
has positioned LATAM as the most punctual airline 
group in the world. Moreover, our commitment to

supported by an efficient cost structure. In 2019, 
we maintained our CASK ex-fuel at USc4.5, ranking 
among the most efficient airlines in the region. As 
a result of the cost initiatives that LATAM has im-
plemented in the last four years, it has reduced the 
combined unit costs in its Spanish-speaking coun-
tries to under 4 cents1 during 2019. 
LATAM has never invested more in its passengers 
as it did in 2019, and it plans to continue along that 
line. We made progress in the implementation of 
strategic initiatives that continue to improve our 
passengers’ experience. Following the acquisition of 
Multiplus by LATAM Airlines Brazil, the frequent fly-
er program was relaunched under the single brand 
LATAM Pass, consolidating the clients of LATAM 
Pass, LATAM Fidelidade, and Multiplus. LATAM and 
its affiliates operate 67 airplanes with the new cab-
ins, especially designed to offer a first-rate experi-
ence in the industry, with more options, flexibility, 
and customization, to serve passengers’ differ -
ent needs. We expect to complete the first stage 
of the cabin renovation in 2020, which translates 
into over 170 airplanes. In March 2020, we also 
launched the new Premium Economy service for 
our flights operated with narrow-body aircraft, on 
domestic and international operations. We also be-
came the first airline in the region to offer Premium 
services on all its flights. These new cabins offer a 
Premium service both at the airport and on-board, 
including priority check-in and boarding, a differ -
entiated in-flight experience, and blocked middle Index (DJSI)—an acknowledgment of the compa-
ny’s commitment to incorporate sustainable prac -
tices into every aspect of its operations. Today, 
LATAM is the only airline in America with presence 
in this group, and one of the three airlines in the re-
gion in the category.
Moreover, the agreement with Delta is an acknowl-
edgement of LATAM’s footprint in the region, and 
we are excited about the benefits that this strate-
gic alliance can bring to our shareholders, clients, 
and employees. In addition to Delta’s acquisition 
of 20% ownership in LATAM, the LATAM affiliates in 
Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador implemented code-
share agreements with Delta, the affiliates in Bra-
zil have announced a codeshare agreement that 
will become operational during the second half of 
2020, and they expect our affiliate in Chile to an-
nounce its codeshare agreements during the first 
half of 2020, subject to the applicable regulato-
ry approvals. Last, since February 1, 2020, LATAM 
transferred its operations at the JFK internation-
al airport (New York) from terminal 8 to terminal 
4, where Delta connects with over 90 destinations 
in the US, Canada, and the world, strengthening 
LATAM’s network with more destinations.seat, providing more space and privacy. With regard 
to the airport experience, the new VIP lounges were 
opened in Miami, and a self bag drop system was 
implemented at the London, Quito, Brasilia, Guarul-
hos, Congonhas, and Bogota airports.
As a result, our passengers have acknowledged 
us with different awards, such as the “Best Air -
line in South America” in the Skytrax World Air -
line Awards, and the “Best Global Airline in South 
America” , according to APEX Passenger Choice 
awards, among others.
Our commitment to sustainability has also been 
acknowledged in 2019. For the sixth consecutive 
year, the LATAM Airlines Group was listed in the 
‘World’ category of the Dow Jones Sustainability 1 Considering an average route length of 1,000 km.TREND INFORMATION  
On March 12, 2020, LATAM Airlines announced 
the suspension of its guidance for 2020 in light 
of the uncertainty due to the COVID-19 (coro-
navirus) outbreak that is affecting the demand 
for air traffic. As of this date, it is not possi-
ble to quantify the exact impact on demand or 
how long it may take to recover, making it im-
possible to estimate results for the full year.
LATAM is taking immediate measures to min -
imize possible effects of the current scenario, 
including cost reduction and capacity adjust -
ments. Along these lines, and in addition to 
the significant efforts being made by LATAM to 
protect the health and safety of its passengers 
and workers, the LATAM group announces a de -
crease in capacity of approximately 30% of in -
ternational operations for April and May 2020.
On March 16, 2020, LATAM Airlines and its af -
filiates updated the decrease in capacity to 
approximately 70% of total operations, corre-
sponding 90% to international operations and 
40% to domestic operations.
At this time, LATAM is not able to fully deter -
mine the impact on financial results in light of 
the expected lower demand on air travel as a 
result of the impact of the spread of coronavi-
rus (COVID-19) on demand for air travel in the 
regions where the Group operates.

management
 
LATAM’s Corporate Risk Policy defines the main as-
pects to be monitored, the mitigation instruments, 
action plans, and the roles and responsibilities of 
those involved in its management.
In 2019, the process was bolstered with meetings 
with each vice-presidency to incorporate the man-
agement of the issue in executives’ decision-mak-
ing process. The risks discussed and directly mon-
itored by each vice-presidency are included in the 
Risk Board, comprised by various areas, and which 
is one of the main bodies for managing the issue 
in LATAM, with a transversal vision of the different 
businesses. The reports it releases feed the reports 
submitted to the Directors’ Committee (comprised 
by three board members and acting as Audit Com-
mittee) and all other support committees of the 
Board and the Executive Committee.In the main affiliates, risk management follows the 
same standards and tools, even if the focus is on 
local specificities. The report is submitted both to 
the corporate Risk Management area and to the 
country CEO. 
Constantly updated, the most recent risk matrix 
contained 53 transversal and emerging risks. The 
matrix considers the likelihood that a given risk will 
materialize and its potential impact on the oper -
ation. The 53 risks are divided into 14 categories, 
including financial, environmental, operational, se-
curity, and regulatory issues, among others. More-
over, it has specific hues that concentrate the risks 
in given areas of the business, such as, for instance, 
Security, Procurement, and Compliance.The Internal Audit area also supports the risk man-
agement activities, including those topics identified 
as relevant in its monitoring processes.
[+] The full list of the main risk factors is in the 
 Appendices.
EMERGING RISKS
Among the risks that LATAM considers as emerging, 
we find:
• Cyber security: this risk considers attacks that can 
affect the Group’s operating capacity, or that could 
imply access to confidential information on LATAM 
and its clients. To manage the risk of cyber security, 
LATAM has a specific internal program, subject to 
periodic updates. In the Group’s executive structure, 
there is a CISO (Chief Information Security Officer), 
responsible for heading the Technological Risks man-
agement. A multidisciplinary support committee is 
also active (further information ahead), which focuses 
on cybersecurity, IT risks, and other related topics, as 
well as an employee awareness program, protection 
tools, and ongoing monitoring of threats. In addition, 
there is a series of internal standards, such as the In-
formation Security Policy, the Information Classifica-
tion Policy, the Data Protection Standard, and the PCI 
LATAM Security Standard, a requirement to obtain the 
international certification PCI DSS Compliance, which 
regulates issues regarding the protection of consum-
ers’ credit and debit card information. Moreover, as 
cybercriminals become more sophisticated, the cost of proactive and reactive mitigators may increase as 
risk assessment becomes more unpredictable and 
given the hardening of the regulatory environment.
• Dependence on suppliers: depending on third 
parties for essential services is always a risk for any 
company. The issue becomes even more relevant 
at LATAM, when considering the speed at which the 
Group has been incorporating third-party suppliers 
in key services and operations, and its capacity to 
implement the necessary changes in policies and 
procedures to adequately manage the issue and 
ensure that the activities meet LATAM’s quality and 
reliability requirements.

A breach of the confidentiality of clients’ data 
implies a serious reputational risk for the Group. 
Committed to the issue, LATAM implements 
a series of mitigation measures. The Code of 
Conduct, for instance, includes a specific top-
ic on privacy, confidential information, and in-
sider trading. It also has Information Security 
and Information Privacy and Security Classification 
policies, the latter of which is also available on 
the corporate website. The standards for Manag-
ing Information Security Incidents and LATAM PCI 
Security complement the guidelines, structured in 
2018 as part of the process required to obtain the 
PCI Compliance international certification regarding 
consumer credit and debit card data protection. 
LATAM obtained the PCI DSS certification in Au-
gust 2019, and periodic checks are carried out to 
maintain this certification in time.Employees have access to said documents on the 
corporate website. Awareness and communication 
campaigns and e-learning trainings are also held 
frequently; in 2019, over 20 awareness campaigns 
were held on the matter, and over 35,000 employ-
ees and external collaborators received training. 
The Technological Risks Management is available to 
answer any questions the team may have. 
This department is responsible for the activities of 
a committee devoted to the issue, and is com-
prised by professionals from the Risk Management, 
Legal Affairs and Compliance, Investor Relations, 
and Technology areas, among others. The commit -
tee met 12 times in 2019. Management also sub-
mits periodic reports to other administrative bod-
ies, and is responsible for permanently monitoring 
the issue, as well as for structuring contingency 
plans. In the last three years, LATAM registered no 
significant security breaches regarding its custom-
ers’ information.• General insurance: covering various risks that could 
affect the company’s equity, which is protected by a 
multi-risk insurance (including risk of fire, theft, infor -
mation equipment, security remittances, and others, 
based on the coverage of all risks), car insurance, air 
and maritime transport insurance, and civil liability in-
surance. Moreover, the company has life and accident 
insurance contracts covering its staff.
• Customers: None of LATAM’s clients individually 
represents over 10% of its sales.
• Suppliers: In 2019, seven suppliers individually rep-
resented over 10% of their category: Orbital (airport), 
Gate Gourmet (supply and catering), CAE (marketing), 
Google Inc. (employee services), Kuehne Nagel (trans-
portation), Unilode Aviation (administration), and 
Everfit S.A. (uniforms).
• Trademarks and patents: The Company and its 
affiliates use various trademarks, which are duly 
registered before the relevant bodies in the various 
countries where they carry out their operations or 
which are their origin and/or destination, in order to 
distinguish and market their products and services in 
said country. Among the main brands are: LATAM Air -
lines, LATAM Airlines Argentina, LATAM Airlines Brazil, 
LATAM Airlines Chile, LATAM Airlines Colombia, LATAM 
Airlines Ecuador, LATAM Airlines Peru, LATAM Cargo, 
LATAM PASS, and LATAM Travel, to name a few.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
• Aviation insurance: LATAM has Aviation, Hull, and 
Legal Liability Insurance, which covers all risks inher -
ent to commercial aviation, such as the loss or dam-
age of aircraft, engines, spare parts, and third-party 
liability (passengers, cargo, baggage, airports, etc.).
After the association between LAN and TAM, the 
insurance of both companies was acquired by 
LATAM Airlines Group, which continued the practice 
that LAN adopted in 2006 together with IAG (which 
comprises British Airways, Iberia, and their sub-
sidiaries and franchisees). The increase in business 
volumes translated into better coverage and lower 
operating costs.

The excellence of the products and services ac -
quired, regular supply, reliability in deadlines, and 
competitive prices are priority issues for LATAM in 
its relations with suppliers. The strategy based on 
these matters enables the Group to manage risk 
factors of the business, contribute to the advance 
of its business partners, and drive the economic 
and socioenvironmental development of the re-
gions where it operates.
In 2019, the supplier network comprised 15.3 thou-
sand suppliers with different sizes, in various seg-
ments and countries; most of them were based in 
South America, where LATAM operates. Of the total 
suppliers, 13% are deemed critical and represent 
41% of the Group’s revenue volume, which totaled 
US$9,203,565,892. The critical supplier classifi-
cation includes those that are difficult to replace 
and those whose interruption in supply could affect 
operations.To ensure a closer relation that will be more fo-
cused on the specificities of the various sectors 
where suppliers operate, management is segment -
ed into technical purchases (products and services 
directly related to the business operations), and 
non-technical purchases (linked to intermediate 
activities), encompassing 21 product and service 
categories.
Technical purchases include suppliers of fuels; 
fleet and engines; engineering services; consum-
ables and spare parts; PMA (Part Manufacturer 
Approval); wheels, brakes, tires and avionics; in-
flight entertainment; seats, materials, and trim; 
sales; larger components, such as landing gear; 
pool (repair, exchange, and rental of certain com-
ponents made available via a pool of suppliers); 
and non-pool purchases (tools and other types of 
components).
Non-technical purchases include suppliers of air -
ports; administration; supply and catering; infra-
structure; hotels and uniforms; marketing; pro-
fessional services; technology and systems; and 
transportation.

Propyme seal, awarded by the Ministry of Econ -
omy in Chile to companies that agree to pay in -
voices in a maximum period of 30 days to micro, 
small, and medium companies. This commitment 
is part of LATAM’s relationship of accountability

nancing conditions, concretely contributing to eco -
nomic and social development.
COLLABORATIVE WORK
LATAM relies on the supplier network to iden-
tify and develop solutions for in-flight waste 
management. The Recycle Your Trip program 
(read more in Ecoefficiency) manages the waste 
from Mercado LATAM, the Company’s in-flight 
sales service. The program was implemented 
on all domestic flights in Chile in August 2019, 
thanks to the joint work with suppliers, who 
were continuously revising their packaging to 
make the products offered to passengers 100% 
recyclable.
Since 2019, the company has been working on a 
program to eliminate single-use plastic, such as 
disposable cups, flatware, and pillow and blan-
ket wrapping, in order to meet the worldwide en-
vironmental challenges concerning this material.MONITOR RISKS  [308-2 and 414-2]
A matrix identifies the potentially most relevant 
economic, social, and environmental risks in each 
of the 21 supplier categories. This mapping in -
cludes, for instance, companies’ financial health, 
ethical conduct, and compliance with labor and 
human rights standards, as well as fiscal, industry, 
health, and environmental issues.
Based on this matrix, all suppliers are subject -
ed to a preventive analysis of sustainability risks, 
including a lookup system on international data -
bases for cases of unfair competition, corruption 
schemes, financing to terrorism and drug traffick -
ing, child or slave labor, and environmental non -
conformities. The verification in the system is 
done for all new suppliers and monthly for suppli -
ers with active contracts when there is any suspi -
cion of some deviation.
The system issues automatic alerts that are an -
alyzed in depth on a case-by-case basis by the 
Compliance department. When the risk is con -
firmed, LATAM adopts measures that range from 
structuring joint action plans to revoking the con -
tract. In 2019, 9,4 thousand suppliers were eval -
uated and 110 were identified as posing a risk. 
They all underwent more detailed evaluations and 
were subjected to mitigation plans (see chart).Risk management — evolution on targets

To be a LATAM supplier, it is not 
enough to offer the best price, qual-
ity, and service level. It is neces-
sary to share the same guidelines 
on ethics and integrity that rule the 
Group’s behavior, as well as to ad-
here to all legal standards.To guide the relations with suppliers and 
ensure that they adopt the behaviors re-
quired by LATAM, the Group has various 
policies and procedures:
• Corporate Procurement Policy: it outlines 
the management of the supply chain 
and specifies the financial, social, and 
environmental requirements that the 
business partners must meet. Constantly 
updated, the document is in line with 
the Anticorruption Policy and the 
Code of Conduct, and contains regulatory 
specifications for each country where the 
Group operates.
• Contracts: All contracts contain a specific 
environmental clause (see Appendix) that 
establishes that the supplier must meet 
all legal requirements, be responsible for 
eventual penalties, and communicate 
to LATAM any incident that may cause 
environmental damage. Purchase orders, 
for lower volume and/or short-term 
contracts, include a clause that requires 
the supplier to adhere to anticorruption 
and environmental protection practices.• Monitoring Third-Party Intermediaries 
(TPIs): these are suppliers acting on behalf 
of LATAM before national and foreign 
public officials. Prior to their engagement, 
said supplier is subjected to an extensive 
due diligence process. The contract 
includes anticorruption and antibribery 
clauses and, during the life of the contract, 
they are asked to prove their adherence 
to the Code of Conduct and Anticorruption 
Policy. At present, there are 697 suppliers 
registered as TPIs.
• Code of Conduct for Suppliers: launched 
in 2019.Code of Conduct for Suppliers
In 2019, the Code of Conduct for Suppliers was 
launched, including specific guidelines on anticor -
ruption and antitrust practices, access to privileged 
information, privacy, security of confidential and 
client data, digital and cybernetic crime, financial 
and money-laundering crimes, and socioenviron-
mental, labor, and human rights issues. In the ten-
der processes, all participants receive a copy of the 
document, and those chosen must formalize their 
adherence to the Code upon signing the contract.
The document also includes a recommendation that 
each business partner establish their own Supplier 
Code of Conduct, in the aim to foster good practices 
throughout the value chains related to LATAM.
New management tool
In 2019, the Group implemented in every country 
where it operates a new supplier management tool: 
The SAP Ariba Supplier Management system. The 
tool unifies various processes related to the sup -
ply chain, improving the monitoring of the base and 
transparency in all stages of the relation with part -
ners, among other improvements.

experience
 
Offering a quality experience to all clients in the 
various stages of interaction with the brand is a 
permanent goal for LATAM. This includes the careful 
management from the moment when a passenger 
buys a ticket up to their in-flight experience, con-
sidering aspects such as security, ease in the pur -
chase and check-in, punctuality, cabin appearance 
and comfort, channels for interaction, and service 
and entertainment options, among other aspects. 
Based on a transversal vision, the Group acts si-
multaneously in the various stages of work to offer 
the best products and services and meet the de-
mands of the different profiles and needs.
In 2019, the Group made progress on its process 
to transform passengers’ travel experience, with 
an investment of close to US$400 million in the 
cabin modernization of most of the fleet up to 
2020. According to the project timeline, close to 
42 airplanes were modernized during 2019, add-
ed to the arrival of two 787-9 airplanes with a 
new design. Assigned to LATAM Brazil and LATAM 
Peru, the Airbus A320, Boeing 767, and Boeing 777 models are already operating domestic and 
international flights.
LATAM also relaunched the VIP lounge at the Mi-
ami (US) airport and it is building a new space 
in Santiago (Chile), following the opening of 
the new terminal.
Currently, in addition to Miami and Santiago, LATAM 
has its own lounges in the airports of Bogota (Co-
lombia), Buenos Aires (Argentina), and Guarulhos – 
São Paulo (Brazil), which serve an average of 2,800 
clients per day. One of the main benefits that the 
alliance with Delta Air Lines could provide to LATAM’s 
passengers is the possibility of enjoying the VIP 
spaces of the US airline in different countries.
CABIN TRANSFORMATION
Main changes 
Wide body planes 
Premium business class includes: 
• isle access for all passengers; 
• more privacy;
• 180° reclining seats;
• differentiated entertainment system;• extra compartments for personal items;
• snacks selected on the personal screen;
• fewer interruptions by the crew.
Narrow body planes 
• Special LATAM+ seats: more space, exclusive places 
for hand baggage, and larger personal screens;
• intelligent seat distribution in the back rows, with 
more seats and more appealing fares.
AIRFARES
There are four types of fares on domestic and in -
ternational flights for clients to choose the fare 
that best meets their needs and priorities, with 
the option to buy additional services, such as bag 
tag, preferred seating, and flexibility for travel 
date changes. With this model, LATAM manages 
to foster access to air transportation for different 
client profiles.
In 2019, the Group launched another fare alterna -
tive: Basic economy, for those who travel with only 
a small bag. The new fare is ideal for short trips, for 
leisure or business, where it is possible to carry few 
personal items. Its average value is US$9 less than 
the economy fare, which includes up to 10 kilos of 
carry-on baggage in Brazil and up to 8 killos in oth -
er countries.Offered initially on domestic flights operated by 
LATAM Chile, LATAM Peru, LATAM Colombia, LATAM 
Ecuador, and LATAM Argentina, the new option was 
soon adopted by the passengers.

NA: Information not availableLATAM Cargo also uses the NPS to gauge custom-
er satisfaction. The improvement in internal pro-
cesses and a closer relationship with clients influ-
enced the indicator’s growth, which increased 32 
points in 2019, vs. 23 points in 2018. The target 
set for 2019 was 26.
MINDING EACH DETAIL
The focus on a better in-flight experience also 
comprises specific actions and small operating 
adjustments in the local routines and habits. 
On some domestic flights in Brazil, for in-
stance, the in-flight menu was adapted based 
on the day of the week and the time of day. 
The Friday afternoon menu recreates a happy 
hour environment, offering drinks. And to ca-
ter to those who travel for business, the Group 
expanded the options of flights early and late 
in the day in cities such as São Paulo, Rio de 
Janeiro, and Brasilia.MONITORED SATISFACTION
With ongoing monitoring of customer perception 
at the different moments of contact, the Group 
manages to act quickly to fix possible mistakes, 
implement improvements, and make the nec -
essary clarifications to clients. One example is 
the post-flight survey, known as Voz del Cliente 
(Voice of Customer). The survey, which includes 
questions regarding the in-flight and airport ex -
perience, as well as the likelihood that they will 
recommend LATAM, is sent upon landing to all 
passengers who provided their e-mail address. 
The survey has a response rate that is deemed 
satisfactory, as roughly 300 thousand answers are 
received each month. Management receives the 
gathered information and is in charge of managing 
the topics brought up by the survey.
Annually, a more strategic satisfaction survey 
is also carried out, based on the Net Promot -
er Score (NPS) methodology, where results are 
measured on a scale from 100 negative points to 
100 positive points. The various initiatives carried 
out throughout the year to guarantee passenger 
satisfaction had a positive effect on NPS, whose 
consolidated result in 2019 totaled 33 points; the 
target was 30. Growth compared to 2018 to -
taled 8 points. This evolution took place despite a 
complex external environment in Chile, impacted 
by the popular demonstrations. The scope of the 
survey included 3.6 million answers—close to 5% 
of the total passengers transported.

pects to reach over 15 airports with this technology 
which, in addition to benefitting passengers, frees 
the staff to provide personal assistance. 
LATAM is also looking at facial recognition using 
biometrics to put it to various uses, currently in a 
testing phase during boarding. In 2018, it was im-
plemented at the Montevideo (Uruguay) airport, 
and in 2019, it arrived in the Orlando (US) airport. 
With this format, presenting and checking ID docu-
ments is done only by the police authority. As with 
the self bag drop, facial recognition can only be im-
plemented with airports’ collaboration. 
The website and app should soon have a button 
enabling clients to choose how they wish to pay 
for their ticket: with money or through the ex -
change of miles from the LATAM Pass frequent 
flyer program. Moreover, it will be possible to use 
a combination of these options: part of the value 
paid in miles, and the remainder, in money. This 
new function is part of a broad project to further improve LATAM’s value proposition in the digital 
world, seeking to offer greater comfort, autonomy, 
and security to passengers.
Moreover, we have LATAM Play, a platform that 
enables passengers to watch, during their flight, 
series, movies, news, and other content, and listen 
to music through their mobile device (smartphone, 
tablet, or laptop). 
LATAM APP
The number of registered users of the LATAM 
App increased from 5.5 million in 2018 to 8 
million in 2019. One of the features of the app 
is the augmented reality solution to determine 
if passengers’ carry-ons are within the al-
lowed limits. It is also possible to perform the 
check-in, issue the boarding pass, and confirm 
the flight status, choose a new flight in case 
of cancelation, and purchase a LATAM+ Seat, 
among other features. All these options are 
also available from the My Trips menu, on the 
LATAM website.4

way in which clients purchase products and ser -
vices, and how they relate to companies As for 
companies, the new resources enable them to 
automatically process large volumes of informa-
tion that guide their decision-making, streamline 
processes, and make it possible to customize the 
experience. At LATAM, this translates, in prac -
tice, into the use of analytics, a daily processing 
of thousands of data on flights to perfect safe-
ty procedures (see page 98 ) and fuel consumption 
(see page 81), and the delivery of autonomy and 
control to clients when managing their own flights.
In 2019, the group emphasized passengers’ expe-
rience at airports, boosting self-service. The use 
of check-in kiosks and printing their own boarding 
pass and bag tags was encouraged, achieving an in-
crease of over 30% in their use. During 2019, LATAM 
began using the self bag drop in São Paulo, Brasil-
ia, and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), London (England), 
Bogota (Colombia), and Quito (Ecuador), enabling 
clients to have the possibility of a 100% automated Technological

Artificial intelligence
In 2019, LATAM was a pioneer in South Ameri-
ca in offering clients in Brazil the possibility of 
interacting with the Group through Amazon’s 
Alexa voice service. The virtual assistant pro-
vides information regarding flight status and 
suggests destinations, among other data. It is 
enough to open the Alexa application and se-
lect the LATAM skill. 
On social media
LATAM is increasingly more active on social 
media both to publish releases regarding the 
day to day operation and to involve clients and 
other people in specific topics. With the so-
cial demonstrations that took place in Chile as 
of October, LATAM encouraged the use of the 
Twitter channel; it published over 20 releas-
es regarding the operations in the country in 
a single day. LATAM’s campaigns to celebrate 
LGBTI+ Pride Day (June 28) and to promote 
the Stormtrooper Plane with theme art of the 
Star Wars saga (as a result of the partnership 
between LATAM and Disney), also had broad 
repercussions in social media. 
A world of possibilities
In association with Google, the LATAM website 
launched an ideal function for those who wish to 
travel but have no set plan as yet. On the main 
page of the website, after clicking on the “Don’t 
know where to go yet?” tab, the client has access 
to an interactive world map, a choice of flights, and 
their prices to different places around the globe. It 
is possible to use filters for dates, prices, and types 
of destination (sun and sea, gastronomy, couples, 
night life, and culture), thus refining the search.
The LATAM app already  
has 8 million registered 
users. The augmented reality 
solution to measure carry-ons 
is one of its functions.

Topic managementContext and positioningDevelopments in 2019 
For passengers, a flight’s 
guaranteed arrival time is 
essential and a key factor in 
satisfaction. In LATAM, punc -
tuality is a commitment of 
the whole company, and it 
depends on the coordina-
tion of various teams—air -
port service, supply, bag 
tags, cleaning, crew—and 
on minding every detail from 
the moment when the plane 
lands until it takes off again.In the aviation sector, the on-time perfor -
mance (OTP) indicator is usually monitored 
per standard DEP15, which considers flights 
that take off with delays of up to 15 min-
utes. LATAM calculates its targets based on 
that indicator and, internally, it also mon-
itors its performance based on the DEP0 
standards (departure on time) and ARR14 
(arrivals up to 14 minutes after the sched-
uled time).
The Group has annual on-time performance 
targets and good results have a positive ef -
fect on the calculation of the variable com-
pensation of the teams involved.The Group adopted a daily monitoring mod-
el, directly involving management and the 
teams, with a prompt identification and cor -
rection of risks and deviations. The learning 
also resulted in improvements in standards 
and procedures, such as:  
• Schedule adjustments to define the best 
times and minimize the risk of delays, 
particularly at saturated airports;
• Coordination among the teams for check-in, 
boarding, and ground handling to ensure 
agility throughout the process flow;
• Procedure revisions to streamline the 
stages of securing the airplane’s doors, 
communications with the control tower, and 
storing carry-on baggage, among others;
• Crew assignments on short, consecutive 
flights, without the need for team rotation.Group boarding
The new boarding model ad-
opted in 2019 also had a bear -
ing on punctuality. Passengers 
are divided into groups from 
1 to 6; priority passengers 
continue to board first, as do 
LATAM Pass frequent flyers. 
In addition to reducing board-
ing times, the change led to 
greater peace of mind among 
passengers.

The Safety, Quality, and Environment Policy is 
LATAM’s main environmental management guide-
line and it follows the international standards and 
regulations. The Group periodically monitors its 
performance with regard to the defined goals and 
targets, in a process that seeks to generate val-
ue for society, the environment, and the business. 
Currently, 91% of the operations, have an environ-
mental management system (SGA, for its Spanish 
acronym). The goal is to reach 100% by 2021.
The share of operations that have SGAs certified 
by international standards is 32%. The LATAM Car -
go operation in Miami (US) is certified under ISO 
14001/2015, for environmental management and 
an internal diagnosis is underway to define the 
plans to certify other operations in the future.
The (domestic and international) aviation opera-
tions, the corporate offices, and the Maintenance 
Base of LATAM Colombia, as well as the inter -
national operations of LATAM Chile, are certified 
under the IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) standard of the International Air Transport Associa-
tion (IATA).
The IEnvA certification is voluntary, specific for the 
aviation sector, and has two stages. The first con-
siders the commitment of top management, the 
scope of the environmental management systems 
adopted, and the identification of legal require-
ments and environmental impacts of all flights and 
activities. LATAM Colombia is certified in this stage, 
together with four other companies in the world. 
LATAM Chile is certified in stage two, which includes 
a total of six certified companies. Stage two consid-
ers the aspects of the first level together with other 
points: the definition of goals and targets, commu-
nication and training actions, and the performance 
of audits are some examples.
 
  
Created especially  
for the aviation industry, the 
IEnvA certification is in line with 
the requirements of ISO 14001, 
and has been implemented in the 
operations of Chile and Colombia.EVOL VING TOGETHER  [102-12 and 102-13]
LATAM participates actively in the discussions on 
environmental topics both in benchmark organi-
zations of the aviation sector and in multisectoral 
agencies and initiatives. In addition to sharing ex -
periences, presence in those bodies enables the 
Group to collaborate in the construction of joint 
solutions and identify opportunities to improve its 
internal proceses. 
In the environment of the aviation sector, 
the main ones are:
• International Air Transport Association (IATA): as a 
member of the association, LATAM focuses specifically 
on discussions involving climate change, noise, and 
environmental management. IATA participated actively 
in the approval of CORSIA (the acronym for Carbon 
Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Avia-
tion), an unprecedented sectoral agreement fostered by 
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and 
approved in 2016 for the reduction and mitigation of 
emissions from air transportation activities until 2035 
(see page 84).• Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport As-
sociation (ALTA): LATAM participates in the regional 
discussions on emissions and climate change. 
• Consejo Empresarial Brasileño para el Desarrollo 
Sostenible (CEBDS – Brazilian Business Council for 
Sustainable Development): LATAM Brazil is a member 
of this agency, which is devoted to foster sustainable 
development through collaboration with governments 
and other members of civil society.
• Reforestemos Patagonia (Reforesting Patagonia): 
LATAM Chile was a founding member and maintains 
an active participation in this initiative to reclaim the 
ecosystem in the Chilean Patagonia.
• South Pole: the organization manages the environmen -
tal protection projects that enable LATAM Colombia to 
neutralize the emissions from its ground operations since 
2013, and its air operations since 2017 .
• WWF-Brazil: LATAM Brazil is part of this group of com -
panies committed to the preservation of biodiversity and 
the rational use of natural resources in the country.

According to the International En -
ergy Agency (IEA), aviation will rep -
resent 15% of the increase in global 
oil demand by 2030, thus raising 
the sector’s total greenhouse gas 
emissions. For comparison pur -
poses: Growth projections are the 
same for passenger vehicles. Ac -
cording to the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 
aviation stands for 2.5% of green -
house gas emissions (GHG) gener -
ated by human activities.
LATAM is working on various proj -
ects to mitigate, reduce, and com -
pensate its carbon footprint, in 
addition to identifying new oppor -
tunities for managing environmen -
tal impacts and fostering eco-effi -
cient practices.Internally, climate change management in LATAM implies:
• The establishment of reduction targets in line with the 
required level of decarbonization to limit to 1.5°C the increase 
in global temperature;
• The focus is on the efficient use of alternative fuels;
• The establishment of offset targets through investments in 
high-quality certified projects;
• The ongoing monitoring of results;
• The effective management of risks and opportunities linked to 
climate change.
Externally, it includes:
• Adherence to sectoral commitments, such as the commitment 
to Carbon Neutral Growth as of 2020 (CNG2020), a voluntary 
IATA initiative, with targets and deadlines for emissions 
compensation; and preparation to meet the OACI’s CORSIA 
reduction targets;
• Participation in the Brazilian discussions to enable the use of 
biofuels on a large scale in aviation, which would be directly 
reflected on the impacts of the sector.

ecoefficiency
 
LATAM seeks, permanently, to increase the eco-
efficiency throughout its operations, which trans-
lates, in practice, into: consuming less fuel (main 
generator of CO2 and other atmospheric emis-
sions), energy, and water, generating less waste, 
and guaranteeing its proper disposal. CARBON FOOTPRINT
As the main environmental impact of the sector, 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission management and 
reduction are a priority for LATAM. To effective -
ly know the impact of the ecoefficiency and offset 
initiatives adopted, monitoring progress is essential. 
For this purpose, the Group inventories its green -
house gases annually, based on standard ISO 14064. 
The Group’s total carbon footprint in 2019 was 
12,386,323 million tons of CO2 equivalent—a 7% 
increase compared to the result of 2018. The net 
carbon footprint, which subtracts from the total 
the emissions offset throughout the year, settled 
at 12.253.203 tons of CO2 equivalent in 2019—
10% growth compared to 2018. The increases 
are due to a lower volume of emissions offset 
throughout 2019, following the end of the offset 
projects in Colombia (read more below).

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsINTEGRATED REPORT 2019REDUCTION TARGETS WITH 
A SCIENTIFIC BASIS
In 2019, LATAM began using a science-based 
targets methodology, in order to set green-
house gas emissions reduction targets based 
on science, and thus drive the initiatives relat -
ed to the climate change strategy.
Early in 2020, the Group adhered to Science 
Based Target Initiative (SBTi), a coalition that 
gathers the Global Compact, Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP), World Resources Institute (WRI) 
and the World Wide Fund for Nature - WWF. 
LATAM is the only airline in the American con-
tinent to adopt a commitment with SBTi. The 
next step, under development, is to present the 
Company’s work targets to SBTi for validation.
The sustainability strategy, in its dimension on 
Climate Change, has various goals, such as con-
tributing to limit global temperature in the XXIst 
century to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. This 
limit is in line with the recommendations of the 
fifth address of the United Nations’ (UN) Inter -
governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).Risks and opportunities  [201-2]
LATAM’s management of climate change is cen-
tered around a broad vision of risks and opportu-
nities. One of the risks identified is the adoption 
of restrictive laws and regulations in the countries 
where the Group operates, that may imply tax pay-
ments on LATAM’s GHG emissions. This is already 
a reality in Colombia. In 2019, the Group paid the 
tax, as it did not manage to neutralize 100% of the 
emissions caused by its domestic air operations, 
which had guaranteed LATAM Colombia’s exemption 
until then. In Europe, there are now taxes for emis-
sions of other gases that cause acid rain, such as 
NOx (nitrogen oxide).
Another identified risk regards the CORSIA sec -
toral agreement, for the reduction and offset of the 
aviation sector’s GHG emissions, should a country 
where LATAM operates decide to enforce the agree-
ment earlier. Likewise, environmental liabilities 
which, in addition to financial damage, have a high 
power of impacting organizations’ reputation, are 
considered potential risks. Last, the Group includ-
ed the possibility of an increase in high-impact cli-
mate phenomena, such as cyclones and hurricanes, 
capable of affecting LATAM’s operations, causing 
the cancelation of flights and even the interrup-
tion of operations for a given period, negatively 
affecting revenue. Such phenomena may result in 
a reduction in the number of tourists that visit the 
affected regions in the following months.Heeding all these risks, LATAM focuses on a series 
of initiatives to reduce its operations’ fuel con-
sumption and thus, its GHG emissions, ratifying its 
commitment to the sectoral initiatives on the mat -
ter. Moreover, it monitors the global regulatory en-
vironment, making periodic estimations to under -
stand the impact that taxes related to emissions 
of GHGs, other gases, and noise could have on the 
business, should they be adopted by all the coun-
tries where it operates. Simultaneously, it invests in 
the modernization of its fleet, with the systematic 
substitution of airplanes with more efficient mod-
els, and in technologies and navigation systems 
that guarantee operation in adverse weather condi-
tions. Moreover, it supports the discussions on the 
development of more sustainable alternate fuels.
For LATAM, climate change also offers business 
opportunities. The Group believes that, more and 
more, companies’ management of the issue can set 
them apart from their competitors and have a pos-
itive impact on the brand’s reputation. By respond-
ing to the expectations and demands of the various 
stakeholders, the Group attracts new clients and 
generates loyalty among its current ones—mainly 
those who are accustomed to choosing a company 
or brand for its attributes, in addition to price, se-
curity, and quality.LATAM is the only airline 
in America to adopt a 
commitment with the Science 
Based Target initiative.

Note: in the emissions intensity indicators, the year-over-year variation is not perceivable in this chart because the figures show 
only two decimals. FUELS [302-4]
The first front of climate change management 
comprises the actions to reduce GHG emissions, 
such as prioritizing LATAM’s efforts to decrease 
jet fuel consumption. This input represents the 
most important operating expense for both the 
Group and its peers in the sector, and can have 
a bearing on medium- and long-term economic 
sustainability.
Since 2010, LATAM has a program to identify and 
monitor efficiency measures, and it is applied inte-
grally and with uniform metrics throughout all the 
affiliates since 2016. The fuel efficiency program is 
managed by a specific area, but it depends on the 
development of other areas and each affiliate to 
achieve the proposed targets. This interaction also 
ensures that a good practice identified can quickly 
be deployed. 
Savings achieved in 2019 were possible thanks to 
a set of measures currently implemented by the 
Group. Among the new actions, we find: the stan-
dardization in choosing alternative airports, used if 
it is not possible to land at the destination airport, 
for all of LATAM’s destinations; and the command 
crew’s management of the extra fuel carried, which 
made it possible to optimize the amount of this 
input transported on each route, decreasing the flight’s total weight. Changes in taxiing procedures, 
such as the use of a single engine without the need 
to use the Auxiliary Power Units, also resulted in a 
decrease in fuel consumption.
In 2019, LATAM avoided the 
consumption of 60.6 million 
gallons of fuel (7 ,942 TJ, in line 
with the 2019 target); 
In numbers, this volume translates 
into US$145 million in savings;  
The 2020 target is to 
prevent the consumption of 
68.8 million gallons.In addition to GHG, the 
LATAM monitoring system 
includes other emissions, such as 
NOx, SOx, and gases that affect 
the ozone layer.

 ►Investments in more modern and efficient air -
craft, such as the Boeing 787, the Airbus A350 
and the Airbus A320neo. The investment has 
been carried out to make adaptations to the 
whole Airbus A320 fleet, leading to greater effi-
ciency in standard operating procedures.
 ►Weight reduction measures, such as minimizing 
unnecessary onboard water, using ultra-light 
service carts, optimizing fuel according to des-
tination, improving the distribution of weight 
to have an optimal center of gravity and the 
improvement of load factor (the combination of 
passenger and cargo services).
 ►As of 2019, LATAM Pilot Tools, an internal-
ly-developed mobile app, was deployed. This 
app enables the customized feedback for flight 
crews, focusing on captains’ request and use 
of fuel and fuel consumption on the ground, 
among other efficiency and security indicators.  
This app is innovative, as it is the first time 
that a direct communication channel has been 
created between flight crews and the compa-
ny’s security efficiency operations. At Decem-
ber 2019, improvements have been achieved in 
3 initiatives related to the app. ►Standardized operational procedures in every 
stage of the flight (taxiing, climb, cruise, ap-
proach and landing), for instance, changes in 
the climb profiles, which generate savings with 
minimal changes to the flight crew’s workload, 
or minimizing the use of the auxiliary power unit 
when aircraft is on the ground.
 ►Monitoring maintenance and performance of the 
fleet including frequent engine washes, which al-
low more efficient combustion of fuel and reduce 
emissions in airport areas.
 ►Improvements of the flight plan and its man-
agement, including continuous feedback using a 
post-flight analysis tool called Full Tracks de-
veloped by the Fuel Team with the support and 
collaboration of Operations and Safety. This 
tool allows us to better program and optimize 
our flight plans. During the second half of 2019, 
changes were implemented in the policies, op-
timizing fuel planning based on the destination, 
standardizing policies, allowing for centralized 
performance tracking and criteria unification.TECHNOLOGY DEDICATED TO ECOEFFICIENCY
An initiative that began to be carried out 
manually a few years ago became 100% au-
tomated in 2019, thanks to the adoption of 
a software for LATAM’s Operations Control 
Center (OCC). The tool analyzes the perfor -
mance of each plane in terms of fuel con-
sumption, which makes it possible to know 
which is the most efficient airplane from the 
viewpoint of flying a given route, helping the 
OCC to make the best decision: upscale the 
plane that uses less fuel to longer routes, 
and vice-versa. It is not a matter of the dif -
ferentiation by airplane model, as it is pos-
sible to have two planes of the same mod-
el that consume different amounts of fuel, 
based on the type of engine installed and 
the time of use given to each plane. 
Since late 2018, LATAM also has an app that 
provides pilots with information regarding their 
own performance on each route that they op-
erate, compared to the crews’ average. This 
enables them to take steps that will have a 
positive effect on fuel consumption. Based on 
the data gathered, pilots manage to: ►redefine the amount of reserve fuel carried;
 ►adopt more efficient aircraft altitude and stabi-
lization procedures, prior to the landing. In this 
case, it is possible to keep the plane stabilized 
at lower altitudes, which require less fuel, but 
always minding the established safety limits;
 ►rationalize the use of the auxiliary power 
unit (APU), specifically for when the airplane 
is on land. There is information regarding the 
electrical equipment or equipment that uses 
other fuels available at each airport, elim-
inating the use of the APU and generating 
greater fuel savings. 
The application, which monitors the close to 
five thousand flights performed each year, 
analyzes over 50 elements, which totals 
around 25 million data processed annually. 
All these data are evaluated by the teams in 
charge, shared when necessary with the pi-
lots and other LATAM professionals, and lead 
to the setting of new targets to improve the 
Group’s efficiency.

The gradual overhaul of the operating fleet is 
one of the Group’s commitments that also im-
pacts ecoefficiency. LATAM ended 2019 with 13 
Airbus A350-900 and 26 Boeing 787 Dreamlin-
er–versions 8 and 9–both benchmarks in fuel 
consumption and in the reduction of green-
house gases and noise. Moreover, it has 49 Air -
bus A321 and 13 Airbus A320-Neo; the latter, 
for instance, consumes 15% less fuel and gener -
ates 50% less noise than the equivalent model 
of the previous generation.   ALTERNATE FUELS
LATAM was the first airline group in South Ameri-
ca to perform a flight on biofuels in 2010 in Bra-
zil. Later, in 2012 and 2013, two other commercial 
flights in Chile and Colombia used biofuels. This 
pioneering spirit proves the Group’s commitment to 
the talks to facilitate the production and commer -
cialization of aviation biofuels on a large scale.
Depending on the crop used, biofuels could replace 
up to 80% of jet fuel, contributing to more signifi-
cantly decrease its greenhouse gas emissions. So 
far, however, the biofuels with potential for use in 
aviation have major limitations that restrict their 
application on a large scale. Some examples are 
the imbalance between production volume and de-
mand, high prices, and distribution complexities.
For its adoption on a large scale, the product must 
be appealing from an environmental, social, and 
economic perspective. There are currently several 
initiatives to develop sustainable biofuels in several 
countries, but as yet lacking an outlook for com-
mercial use, although several airlines participate in 
experimental flights or are involved in the research 
and development of technology.
To that effect, there is still a significant debate 
regarding environmental, technological, econom-
ic, and ethical issues related to the production of 
biofuels, which naturally affects the aviation in-
dustry’s decisions.statement requesting that biokerosene not be in-
cluded as a defining parameter in this first cycle 
of targets. In the view of the Group and its peers 
in the sector, as there is currently no production of 
aviation biokerosene on a commercial scale in the 
country, the RenovaBio targets could affect the 
aviation industry with a possible increase in the 
prices of fossil fuel for aviation, without offering 
any direct incentive to biofuels producers to invest 
in the production of aviation biokerosene. The 
CNPE accepted ABEAR’s argument and did not 
include biokerosene in the list of substitute fuels 
already commercially available.
LATAM continues to defend the creation of favor -
able conditions to guarantee the supply of avi-
ation biofuel at competitive prices, which would 
boost demand from the aviation industry players 
without affecting the financial sustainability of the 
parties involved.
 For LATAM Group, overcoming these obstacles de-
pends on an integrated and a multisector approach 
involving growers, the petrochemical industry, air -
craft engine manufacturers, distributors, govern-
ment authorities, and regulatory bodies.
The Group monitors and participates in Brazil in the 
talks regarding biofuels, where the implementation 
of the National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio) is dis-
cussed, as it seeks to drive the production of biofu-
els in the country. 
Following the approval of the law that created 
RenovaBio, national emissions reduction targets 
were established for the country’s fuel network in 
the 2018-2028 period. They are deployed annual-
ly as mandatory individual targets for distributors, 
based on their market share of Brazil’s fossil fuels 
in the preceding year. RenovaBio was enforced in 
late 2019, following the regulation of decarburiza-
tion credits (CBIOs), a financial asset traded on the 
B3, Brazil’s stock market, which must be purchased 
by distributors and can be marketed by biofuels 
producers and importers certified by the program. 
The National Council of Energy Policy (CNPE, for 
its Portuguese acronym) launched a public con-
sultation following the release of the national 
reduction targets in 2018.  At that time, LATAM, 
individually and through the Brazilian Association 
of Airline Companies (ABEAR), issued a public

On a different axis of climate change management, 
we find the emissions offset strategy. In order to 
reduce its environmental impact, LATAM began, 8 
years ago, to neutralize its ground emissions with 
an initiative in Peru. In 2019, it began to purchase 
carbon credits from a REDD project located in the 
Peruvian Amazon. This is the Madre de Dios Ama-
zon REDD Project, which has 100 thousand hect -
ares of sustainable forest management in the 
region that gives the project its name, in the south-
east of the country.
Since 2007, the wood from this initiative has been 
certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). 
Moreover, the whole project has been validated by 
the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) since 2013, and 
by the Climate Community and Biodiversity Stan-
dard (CCB) in its top category (Gold) since 2009. 
The VCS is a voluntary certification for carbon off -
set projects, whereas the CCB acknowledges car -
bon offset projects that, simultaneously, reduce the 
impact of GHG emissions and preserve biodiversity, 
as well as fostering the development of local com-
munities. Both programs are managed by VERRA, a 
non-profit organization.
Merging the environmental and social focus, a third 
of what LATAM contributed to the project was 
channeled to an NGO devoted to providing chil-dren and teenagers with environmental education. 
Creatively, the NGO works by generating environ-
mental preservation spaces on a small scale, which 
must be managed by the participating children and 
teenagers. The economic viability of these spaces 
is the result of a bond program and LATAM’s con-
tribution financed that program precisely, enabling 
the students of a rural school in Villa Primavera, in 
Madre de Dios, to care for a 200-thousand m2 area 
and learn more about biodiversity, climate change, 
and other environmental topics. They also received 
supplementary school supplies.
2019 was the first year that LATAM has offset the 
ground emissions of its operations in Argentina, Chile, 
and Ecuador. Until then, only LATAM Colombia and 
LATAM Peru were performing the offsets. As of 2021, 
ground emissions from Brazil will also be offset.
After becoming carbon neutral in its ground oper -
ations in 2013, and in its air operations as of 2017, 
LATAM Colombia was unable to continue to offset 
100% of its operations in 2019, due to the lack of 
environmental projects with carbon bonds offered 
in the country. Part of the emissions was offset 
through the purchase of bonds, and for the part 
that it has not been possible to offset, it began to 
pay the Colombian government US$5 per ton of 
CO2 emissions from its domestic flights.The three offset projects which received resources 
in 2019 were:
• REDD+ Mataven forestry protection: reduction 
of deforestation emissions through the sustainable 
management of forests, preservation and improve-
ment of forest reserves, with a total of 1.8 million 
hectares protected;
• Bajo Tulua hydroelectric plant: Located on the 
Tulua river, Valle del Cauca department. It has an 
installed capacity of 19.9 MW, and it is a run-of-river 
power plant that does not require a reservoir;
• Commercial reforestation at Mega: The project is 
located in Puerto Gaitán, Puerto López, and Mapiripán 
(Meta), and it is mainly comprised of acacia. The 
area surrounding the project is predominantly burnt 
savannahs for grazing; thus, in addition to generating 
economic benefits for the population, because this 
is commercial reforestation, it contributes to protect 
the area from inadequate uses—mainly extensive 
livestock farming. 
The Group intends, however, to identify new proj-
ects to neutralize the volume of emissions re-
sulting from the domestic operations of LATAM 
Colombia in 2020.Since 2012 ,  
when the neutralization actions 
began, LATAM has offset over 
956 thousand tons of CO2e. 
In 2019 ,  
over 14 tons of CO2e from 
the ground operations of 
Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and 
Peru were offset. The total 
accrued since 2012 is  
53 thousand tons.
For 2020   
LATAM’s whole ground 
operation is expected to 
become carbon neutral.

In late 2016, the aviation industry was a pioneer in 
adopting a public commitment to gradually reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions in the sector: The Carbon 
Offset and Reduction Scheme for International 
Aviation became known by the acronym CORSIA. 
Through CORSIA, the sector’s goal is to achieve car -
bon neutral growth as of 2020 and to reduce emis-
sions by 50% compared to 2005 by 2050. As of 
2035, ICAO expects the development of biofuels to 
have made greater progress, significantly contribut -
ing to the reduction of the sector’s carbon footprint.
The scheme, endorsed by the 191 member States 
of the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO), comprises various stages. In 2017, the Rec -
ommended Standards and Practices were created, 
delivered to the endorsing countries, and used as 
reference by the latter in setting their Measure-
ment, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) steps.
The voluntary participation stage will begin in 2021, 
lasting until 2026. In Latin America, Mexico, Gua-
temala, and Costa Rica joined voluntarily. In 2027, 
the second stage will begin, which is mandatory for 
those countries whose share in international avia-
tion surpasses 0.5% of the total revenue per ton-ki-
lometer (RTK). In this second stage, of the countries 
where LATAM operates, only Brazil would join.
As of 2019, the Group began reporting the total CO2 
emissions from its international flights to the rele-vant authorities of the countries where it operates, 
as CORSIA proposes. Thus, it expects to contribute 
to the process of defining reduction and offset tar -
gets for those countries. 
As of 2021, the Group should be impacted in the 
cases of flights including two of the countries 
that are already part of the voluntary stage of the 
agreement. An example would be a flight departing 
from Chile, which is not part of the voluntary stage, 
and passing through Mexico and then on to the US, 
both included in that first stage. OTHER FRONTS
Together with the initiatives to reduce fuel consump-
tion, LATAM is working on other fronts seeking to 
improve its efficiency—energy, water, and waste—
which also have set targets (see status below). 
One of the novelties is LATAM’s effort to design 
initiatives that more effectively involve passengers 
on the path towards greater efficiency. Based on 
that stance, in August 2019, LATAM launched in its 
Chilean operations the Recycle Your Trip corporate 
program following a pilot stage in 2018. The pro-
gram will extend to include Colombia, Ecuador, and 
Peru in 2020.
A project to eliminate single-use plastic on board, 
such as plastic cups and wrapping for blankets, pil-
lows, earphones, and flatware used for meals and 
other items, is also underway. This effort involves 
suppliers and various teams as well.
The Group is also revising the amount of water carried 
in each plane during a flight, and seeking for optimi-
zation alternatives, considering the duration of the 
flights and the routes, in addition to discussing guide-
lines for loading water on planes, avoiding, for in-
stance, loading at locations affected by water stress.20 tons 
of plastic, aluminum, and glass 
that did not end up in a landfill 
and were sent to recycling

Recycle Your Trip
After carrying out tests on domestic flights during 
2018 and designing the best model to implement 
selective waste collection on board, LATAM Chile 
officially launched the Recycle Your Trip program 
in July 2019. The program consists in recycling the 
packaging of products sold through Mercado LATAM, 
which offers 30 options of food and beverages at

Chile, LATAM Colombia, LATAM Ecuador, and LATAM 
Peru. Close to 40% of the packaging is recyclable, 
according to a study performed by the Group. 
With passengers’ help, the crew gathers the waste 
in a cart that has different bags, separated by col-
or, to sort each type of material; glass, aluminum, 
plastic, and non-recyclable waste. Upon landing, 
the waste, already separated, is recycled by the 
partner on the ground, Sky Chefs, which includes it 
in its recycling chain.
In 2019, over 20 tons of waste were recycled in 
LATAM Chile. For 2020, the figure is expected to 
reach 55 tons in Chile alone, alongside the launch 
of the program in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. 
In 2021, the initiative will extend to Brazil and 
Argentina.Waste  [306-2]

Internally, LATAM monitors water consumption at 
all its operations, and seeks to foster consumption 
awareness. The corporate offices in Chile, Bra-
zil, Ecuador, and Colombia already have selective 
waste collection and, since 2018, LATAM Chile’s 
current corporate building and the maintenance 
base are supplied exclusively by renewable energy. 
LATAM obtains energy on the open market, directly 
from the generators, at a more competitive cost. In LATAM Colombia, all energy consumed comes from 
renewable sources.
Particularly with regard to the Group’s facilities, in 
2019, a new address was announced for the cor -
porate offices in Chile, which will be located in a 
building constructed following the precepts of the 
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental De-
sign) sustainable building certification, silver level. 
The move should take place during 2022.

of the index has varied throughout the years, 
reflecting changes in the monitoring systems, and 
represented 89% of operations in 2016, and 100%

Topic management
Context and positioningDevelopments in 2019
To put into practice its mission of 
connecting people and destina-
tions, LATAM invests in its em-
ployees. People management 
relies on structured training and 
professional promotion practices, 
as well as an appealing compensa-
tion and benefits package, and it 
seeks to align to the transforma-
tions of the labor market. Dialogue 
and the closeness between the 
staff and management are im-
portant differences to ensure the 
alignment of purposes and the 
joint commitment to the execution 
of the business strategy.
LA TAM’s purpose
We make sure dreams 
reach their destinationThe dialogue and commitment practices 
are included in the routine of both leaders 
and employees. For instance:
• LATAM News: weekly meeting during which 
leaders present to their teams relevant 
information on the Group;
• Expanded: periodic meeting headed by 
the vice-presidents to deliver information 
regarding the business context;
• 1:1 Accompaniment: meetings held 
between the employee and their leader, 
which result in alignments that strengthen 
the individual development process;  
• Recognition Platform: it enables the leader 
to publicly acknowledge an outstanding 
behavior by a member of their team.  
Employees may also acknowledge their 
area colleagues, as well as professionals 
from other sectors.In 2019, top management was even closer to 
the employees. At LATAM Airlines Brazil, for in-
stance, the CEO, Operations and Human Re-
sources directors, and Flight Crew manager have 
a monthly commitment with the command and 
cabin crews in training at the LATAM Corporate 
Academy in São Paulo (SP). They meet with the 
teams to talk about how management and the 
business are doing, and to answer their ques-
tions. The encounter was the solution found to 
make personal interaction closer with this group 
that, given the nature of the job, is not located 
at a specific unit.
In LATAM Airlines Argentina, the Human Re-
sources director implemented a meeting 
agenda with all areas to present new process 
simplification and efficiency practices. This 
step made it possible to better understand the 
guidelines and encouraged professionals’ par -
ticipation in their execution.
The LATAM News of 
Brazil’s Operations area 
took place, in 2019, via 
YouTube, thus enabling 
employees’ remote 
participation.Periodicity is one of 
the key elements for 
dialogue effectiveness. 
LATAM News, for 
instance, is published 
weekly or every two 
weeks, depending on 
the area.The leaders are also trained to dialogue 
with their teams and act collaboratively. 
Through the Barometer tool, employees 
evaluate their immediate superior twice a 
year. Results are discussed with the team 
and bring about improvement plans that 
the boss will carry out.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS
LATAM’s compensation strategy adheres to appli -
cable local legislation and it is aligned to the best 
practices of the labor market. It includes a base 
salary and variable compensation, calculated based 
on the Group’s financial performance throughout the 
year and the achievement of a set of targets: cor -
porate, which apply to all; specific to the employ -
ee’s department; and linked to individual perfor -
mance. The bonus paid to directors is linked to the 
price of LATAM’s shares, and is cumulative and with 
incremental redemption; that is, it can reach 100% 
once two years have elapsed since it was awarded. 
As for salary equality, LATAM maintains its com -
mitment to non-discrimination and equal oppor -
tunities. In 2019, women’s average salary was 78% 
to 99% of men’s average salary, based on the vari -
ous professional categories (see detailed table).In addition to traditional compensation and ben -
efits, such as a health plan, food coupons, and 
life insurance, LATAM bets more and more on of -
fering non-monetary benefits to guarantee a dif -
ferent value proposition for employees that will 
help them to more effectively match their per -
sonal and professional lives. Some of these are:
• jeans day every day of the week, thought to in -
crease professionals’ comfort in their work environ -
ment;
• home office once a week, arranged in advance 
with the immediate superior;
• short Friday, for those who wish to leave work at 
14:00 on Friday and make up for the difference on 
the remaining business days;
• 50% to 75% discounts on airfares confirmed in 
advance. Over 1,000 destinations in 160 countries; 
and
• 100% free trips when seats are available on the 
flights.
As of 2019, LATAM also began to offer the op -
portunity for leaves of absence for up to 30 
days, without pay, for those employees who 
wish to take some external course, guaranteeing 
their return to work upon conclusion of the peri -
od, which can be added to the days of vacation 
that are their due by law.Having employees who can face the business’ 
short- and long-term challenges requires system-
atic investments in professional development. In 
2019, LATAM invested a total of US$22.1 million in 
training. Each employee participated, on average, in 
37 .1 hours of training, totaling 1.5 million hours of 
training in the year. [404-1]
The development strategy has a direct bearing on 
the personal growth opportunities, with horizontal 
and vertical movements. In middle management 
(heads and analysts) and at the executive level, 
87% of the positions were filled with internal move-
ments, in line with the parameter that the Group 
deems satisfactory.Salary comparison women/men1

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsNEW SALARY FLOOR IN CHILE
One of the measures that the Chilean gov-
ernment announced in order to deal with the 
concerns of the local population, who took to 
the streets as of October 2019, was to set the 
gross monthly minimum wage at 350 thou-
sand Chilean pesos. The announcement trig-
gered movements among entrepreneurs to, 
voluntarily, set the gross value at 500 thou-
sand Chilean pesos. LATAM adhered to the 
movement and, going a step further, an-
nounced that the minimum threshold of 500 
thousand net Chilean pesos will be applied to 
net compensation as a parameter for all the 
Group’s employees working in Chile.ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE
That set of measures—closer management, di-
alogue and transparency, opportunities for pro-
fessional development and internal promo-
tion, adequate compensation and economic and 
non-economic benefit package—has a positive 
impact on the organizational climate. Another fac -
tor that contributes towards keeping a satisfied 
team is related to the results of the business itself. 
In 2019, for instance, there was greater stability in 
all operations, a record figure of passengers trans-
ported (74.2 million), and initiatives such as the 
strategic alliance with Delta Air Lines—one of the 
main airlines in the world—bolstering feelings such 
as the pride of belonging and enabling profession-
als to see clearly the path drawn for LATAM.
The annual survey, which uses the Organizational 
Health Index (OHI) methodology, monitors the lev-
els of internal alignment, renovation capacity, and 
performance quality. The leadership assessment 
lies at the core of the survey. In the 2019 sur -
vey, LATAM registered a consolidated OHI of 74, 
setting LATAM in quartile 1, which represents the 
best results. The target for the year was 66. The 
response rate also increased from 75% in 2018 to 
78% in the period.
In all the dimensions that comprise the index, 
LATAM achieved at least 6 points more compared 
to the previous year, and in five of them it ranked in 
the top quartile: External Orientation, Coordination 
and Control, Innovation and learning, Capacities and Responsibility. Among the Group’s main strengths, 
it is worth noting the significant increase of its 
external focus, which seeks to generate and offer 
greater value to clients and associates. Another 
strength identified through the survey was having 
managed to communicate a clear and convincing 
vision, through an efficient leadership to drive the 
organization forward.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
In 2019, 88% of the critical positions had identi-
fied successors. Of them, 58% were ready to take 
on a new position immediately and 42% were being 
prepared to take over a new position in the medi-
um term.
TURNOVER
The turnover rate in 2019 was 13.7%, slightly low-
er than in previous years. The Group continued to 
outsource auxiliary activities in specific operations 
to focus on the activities that are directly related 
to the business, and it remains committed to the 
identification of synergies to simplify processes 
and act with greater efficiency and quality. [401-1]
All those movements are managed by the Hu-
man Resources team, which carefully monitors the 
turnover rates of some strategic functions, such 
as pilots—a specialized activity whose profes-
sional replacement is more complex and takes 
longer. For LATAM, the proper turnover level for 
this function is 4%; in 2019, this group’s turnover 
rate settled at 4.1%.88%
of the positions deemed critical 
have an identified successor.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsSafety is a non-negotiable value for 
LATAM; therefore, the Group works 
permanently on  identifying, prevent -
ing, and mitigating risks in the var -
ious environments and operations, 
and on guaranteeing a safe work 
environment for all the employees. 
Labor health and safety manage-
ment are in an ongoing improvement 
process, which implies the monitor -
ing of internal performance and the 
identification of good practices in the 
external environment.
Critical risks
Six critical risks have been identified 
and are the subject of prevention 
and mitigation actions, programs, 
and processes: Driving moving equip-
ment; exposure to noise; handling 
aircraft engines; handling hydraulic 
systems; work at heights; and work 
in confined spaces.  STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
For employees, actions range 
from the Health and Environ-
ment Week (annually in LATAM 
Airlines Brazil and LATAM Air -
lines Chile, and biannually at 
other operations) to the Safe-
ty Guardians program, active 
in Brazil and in the Group’s US 
branch, which encourages re-
porting unsafe behaviors.
Monitoring
LATAM monitors injury and lost 
day rates, as well as the num-
ber of fatalities, and the Action 
Plan Index (API), which gauges 
the effectiveness of potential 
risk mitigation plans, including 
the total risks identified and 
the various degrees of sever -
ity. The performance of said 
indicators enables the Group to 
establish priority actions.In line with the efforts 
performed in the last 
few years, the injury rate 
dropped again, settling at 
0.74, meeting the internal 
goal for the year (0.82).
In Chile, LATAM also out -
performs the transportation 
and communications sector 
regarding days lost, with a 
rate of 16 vs. the sector’s 
26, according to data from 
the Superintendence of So-
cial Security.1Protected personnel
Context and positioningTopic managementDevelopments in 2019
The issue is systematically 
monitored by management and 
results in initiatives to guaran-
tee that employees are deep-
ly committed to LATAM’s four 
safety principles:
• Safety is everyone’s 
responsibility;
• Respect for all safety 
procedures;
• Everyone should immediately 
report unsafe conditions or 
actions;
• The use of personal protective 
equipment (PPE) is mandatory.
For executives, there are annual 
goals that are related to health 
and safety, whose results have 
a bearing on the performance 
evaluation.The injury rate fell 20%  
compared to 2018. 
Considering the last 
five years, since 2014, 
the accrued reduction 
stands at 52%.

risk factors and criticality degrees, updated pe-
riodically with data from internal analyses and 
events related to global aviation.The Safety, Quality, and Environment Policy gath -
ers the guidelines on the topic and follows the 
parameters established by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO).
The Safety Management System includes tools 
and programs that enable LATAM to act proac -
tively, monitor performance, identify risk situ -
ations, and react promptly to minimize them. 
For a precise and updated diagnosis, the Group 
performs a series of periodic audits, divided into 
three types:
• IOSA Audit (IATA Operational Safety Audit): 
All affiliates have had this certification since 
2007 and undergo a recertification every 
two years;
• Frequent internal audits that assess the 
maturity of the processes implemented in the 
Airports and Maintenance areas;
• Internal operation diagnoses in critical 
areas, such as Engines and Fuels, that check 
whether the activities are being carried out 
according to the established processes.The safety of passengers, 
employees, communities, and 
operation infrastructure is 
LATAM’s number one priority. 
Aside from aligning to inter -
national regulation and excel-
lence standards for the sector, 
the Group works on identify-
ing ongoing evolution oppor -
tunities and strives to achieve 
ever more demanding goals, 
defined monthly based on 
the six best monthly results 
reported in the previous 24 
months.Psychological support
Employees’ psychological wellbeing is constantly 
monitored by the LATAM occupational health teams, 
and includes support for issues related to stress, 
conflicts, or interpersonal difficulties in the teams.
This management was subject to improve-
ments in 2019, with the implementation of the 
SeguraMente program, which guarantees psycho-
logical support offering discretion and humanized 
care for pilots and copilots facing personal and 
family-related challenges. The initiative includes 
visits to specialized doctors and psychological care 
for as long as necessary. Initially adopted in LATAM 
Brazil, the program will begin to expand towards 
other affiliates in 2020.
Substance abuse
All affiliates have alcohol and drug checks with 
random tests given to all the operations area, 
with specific indications that must be implement -
ed in cases with positive results.
The ProAjuda program is carried out by LATAM Bra-
zil as assistance for cases of chemical dependence. 
It serves pilots, copilots, and other crew members 
and teams that work in maintenance, flight dis-
patch, and baggage loading and unloading.  STRAIGHT TO THE POINT

responsibility
LATAM invests in generating awareness and com-
mitment from all its employees to make the op-
eration consistently safer. The process is directly 
aimed at the Safety vice-presidency; it involves 
various teams and is supervised by top manage-
ment. The Group’s CEO receives monthly infor -
mation on the key indicators related to aspects of 
flight, maintenance, cargo, ground operations, and 
airport infrastructure, among others. Performance 
is also subject to periodic analysis by the Board.
The actions concerning the teams seek to bolster 
the culture of safety through training and initia -
tives aimed at commitment and communication. 
One example is the online platform to report safe -
ty incidents and deviations, which is already in -
corporated into the routine of the professionals in 
different areas. In 2019, there were 27 .9 thousand notifications registered on the platform, which is 
available on the web and also in mobile version, 
making it easier for professionals who don’t have 
a set workstation, such as crews and maintenance 
teams, to adhere.
Another way of involving employees, making them 
all feel responsible for ensuring safety, is organiz -
ing spaces for talks to understand their perception 
regarding the various fronts that comprise the issue. 
In the survey carried out late in 2018, for the first 
time, LATAM listened to all employees; the previous 
surveys focused on operating areas only.
The survey applied the methodology of the Inter -
national Air Transport Association (IATA), created 
based on the IOSA standard and the ICAO Safe-
ty, Environment, and Health requirements. Overall, 
there were 60 questions regarding safety aware-
ness; employee empowerment; top management’s 
commitment to the issue; safety policies, process-
es, and procedures; and communication.11.4 thousand employees participated in the survey. 
Of the total surveyed, 85% agreed with the state-
ment “my airline places safety first” , and 81% with 
the statement “my airline is one of the safest ones 
in the world” . The results are in line with the sector 
average on both points: 84% and 83%, respectively.
The internal survey also enabled the identification 
of improvement opportunities in aspects related to 
top management’s commitment to safety, as well 
as to reports and feedback, which were the goal of 
specific strategies in 2019.
LATAM bolstered leaders’ participation in all safety 
events, such as the Safety and Environment Week, 
held at all its operations, as well as the expand-
ed meetings; to begin these meetings, a message 
from the CEO on LATAM’s commitment to the is-
sue is always broadcasted. Communications were 
clearer and sought to bolster the culture of safety 
among employees. Awareness campaigns regard-
ing job security and information security and the 
use of the online platform to report safety in-
cidents and deviations were also held, and vid-
eos regarding the Group’s Emergency Response 
Plan and airport security were also released.  The 
application that provides pilots with information 
gained a new function and now all communica-
tions regarding Operating Security are stored in a 
single place, making it easier for pilots to access 
that material. The cabin crew refresher courses 
were enhanced with the addition of a block devot -
ed to security.   An established practice 
in LATAM, the exchange of 
knowledge regarding security with 
Delta Air Lines should increase, 
following the materialization 
of the strategic alliance. In the 
sector, LATAM participates in 
other dialogue forums, such as the 
IATA group devoted to the matter, 
where it coordinates the work for 
Latin America and the Caribbean.

People trained 1,293 991 1,563DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY: AN ALL Y OF SECURITY
In LATAM, digital technology and flight securi-
ty go hand in hand. The former is necessary to 
ensure a safe operation of the Group’s close to 
1,300 daily flights. As of 2016, an automated 
monitoring system was implemented, which 
can collect roughly 95% of the information 
from all the flights, including data collection 
from all stages of flight. The measurement 
reaches 1,280 parameters per second.
As soon as the plane lands, the data is auto-
matically processed. When the system began 
to be used in LATAM, it was not possible to 
access 100% of the data till seven days later. 
Currently, the timeframe has decreased, and it 
is noow possible to access 80% of the informa-
tion in under three days, thanks to the connec -
tivity improvements in the planes, mainly as a result of the expansion of WiFi networks. This 
progress streamlines decision-making. Ana-
lyzed by a team of specialists, the data makes 
it possible to preventively identify technical 
problems that need maintenance, as well as 
deviations in standard operating procedures, 
among other points.
In addition to monitoring information by route, 
airport, and other segmentations, the Group’s 
security monitoring panel manages data re-
garding pilots’ performance. The reports, sub-
mitted confidentially to each pilot, contain, for 
instance, a comparison of their performance 
with the fleet average on various points that 
impact security and indicate the number of in-
cidents identified during that flight. AIRPORTS, CARGO, AND FACILITIES
LATAM actively participates in instances chaired by 
national and international authorities and agencies 
regarding airport security in order to maintain the 
necessary standards that will enable a safe oper -
ation for passengers and employees. The Group 
works constantly on policies and procedures that 
will enable a strict adherence to the current appli-
cable legislation in all the countries where it oper -
ates, taking preventive, corrective, and ongoing im-
provement actions to prevent illicit interference and 
guarantee that the passengers and cargo trans-
ported arrive safely in their destination.
Within the scope, it also includes corporate facili-
ties, where employee and visitor access to hangars, 
cargo warehouses, and administrative offices is 
controlled, and the critical processes of the opera-
tion are monitored remotely, in order to efficiently 
ensure acceptable levels of security for the compa-
ny’s assets and our people’s belongings.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN
The Emergency Committee is in charge of the emer -
gency response plan; it has representatives from 
various areas of LATAM, and it heads the response 
plan when an emergency occurs, including defin-
ing actions at the affiliates and mobilizing resourc -
es. The response plan concentrates on assisting the 
affected people and their families, communicating 
with the various stakeholders, supporting aviation 
authorities in their investigations, and measures to 
guarantee the continuity of the operation.Whenever it is activated, the plan mobilizes the 
employees of the local committees at nine affili-
ates: Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Ecua-
dor, United States, Paraguay, and Spain. In case of 
an airplane accident or serious contingency, these 
employees are activated in under 5 minutes by the 
LATAM alert system.
The mobilization of the plan takes place, particular -
ly, in the Security Week, held at all affiliates, which 
includes talks, trainings, and an aviation emergency 
simulation. In 2019, during the Week at the affili-
ates, over 1.5 thousand employees who are part of 
the emergency response plan were trained.

Topic management
Context and positioningDevelopments in 2019
Employment generation and eco-
nomic boosts are important ef -
fects of aviation. According to the 
Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), 
the aviation sector is responsi-
ble for over 10 million direct jobs 
worldwide, while a total of 65 mil-
lion jobs depend on the sector and 
related tourist activities1. Accord-
ing to IATA, tourists who traveled on 
international flights in 2018 spent 
US$850 billion at the destinations2.
As the largest airline group in Lat -
in America, LATAM makes a large 
part of this sum possible: In 2019, 
it transported nearly 4.5 mil -
lion passengers on international 
flights to South America, mobilizing 
US$1.33 billion.LATAM has a Corporate 
Citizenship strategy that, 
through the programs in 
place in South America, 
such as Care for My Desti-
nation, Solidary Plane, and 
A Day at LATAM, uses its 
expertise and business ca-
pacity to generate positive 
effects on society and the 
environment. The main fo-
cus is on caring for the des-
tinations in South Ameri-
ca, developing sustainable 
tourism, so the current and 
future generations can vis-
it the great and appealing 
corners of the region.
The joint effort with local 
communities, civil pub-
lic-private agencies and 
organizations, and oth-
er groups strengthens the 
work of various social de-
velopment and preserva-
tion projects, and ensures 
the creation of an ever 
more effective legacy for 
the region.Ongoing learning in the execution 
of the programs guided the review 
of the Corporate Citizenship strat -
egy, making it possible to bolster 
the alignment of the actions to 
the commitment of a positive im-
pact and to LATAM’s mission, and 
provided an even more strategic 
focus to the developed projects.

[203-2]
In 2019, the Care for My Destination program cel -
ebrated a decade of existence, with an investment 
of over US$2.6 million. The program’s focus is to 
develop sustainable tourism through preservation 
and social development programs. This is the most 
consistent example of how LATAM’s commitment, 
through the comprehensive development (financial, 
environmental, and social) of the regions where the 
Group operates, becomes a reality. It also showcas -
es the clear connection between the corporate citi -
zenship and business strategies. In the end, part of 
the Group’s long-term sustainability depends on the 
revenues from transporting passengers who travel 
for tourism and, for tourist activities to continue to 
exist, it is essential that there should be responsibil -
ity for preserving and restoring the natural and his -
torical-cultural heritage.Currently, LATAM works on connecting the Care for 
My Destination program to the new route launch 
strategy, which would enable the Group to develop 
projects under this program at some locations that 
could become a new LATAM route, considering the 
social, environmental, and economic demands of 
the region or city. 
With a transversal cultural outlook, which consid -
ers the preservation and strengthening of the link 
between communities and their history, vocation, 
and surrounding environment, the Care for My Des -
tination program covers initiatives of environmental 
preservation and restoration of the historical heri -
tage, as well as projects to foster income and em -
ployment generation (see table). The strategic focal 
points of the program are related to different targets 
and commitments from the Sustainable Develop -
ment Goals (SDG), particularly those regarding:
• ODS 8: decent work and economic growth;
• ODS 11: sustainable cities and communities;
• ODS 15: life on land;

In 2019, actions were simultaneously developed in four of the 
operation’s countries, totaling nine projects. The work was 
carried out in collaboration with organizations and foundations 
that have knowledge of the locations and communities, as well 
as of their demands and shortcomings. The investment totaled 
US$259.5 thousand in the year.
1 Piedra del Águila 
The small locality is in the Neuquen province, on the 
way to the tourist centers in the Argentinean moun-
tain range. In alliance with association Conciencia, 
local mentors were trained to educate and assist re-
gional entrepreneurs; 25 entrepreneurs participated 
between 2018 and 2019. In addition, together with 
middle school students, neighbors, and company vol-
unteers, work was done to value the most emblem-
atic tourist attraction of the place, the Monumento al 
Aguila (Eagle monument), with the construction of a 
viewpoint and the production of information content 
regarding the local flora and fauna. Currently, the en-
trepreneur mentoring continues, through customized 
monitoring of their business plans to boost social 
development.2 Villa El Chocón 
Known as the dinosaur locality due to the fossils 
found there, Villa el Chocón is one of the most vis-
ited tourist centers in the Neuquen province. The 
project was carried out in alliance with association 
Conciencia, which trains local mentors, and togeth-
er with organizations that specialize in sustainable 
tourism, such as Fundación Buena Vida and Asoci-
ación de Hoteles más Verdes. Late in 2019, train-
ings began for local tourism entrepreneurs in order 
to boost their projects. The fostering of the local 
economy is always managed along the axis of envi-
ronmental awareness, through the publication of 
contents to foster conservation and preservation of 
the local flora and fauna.1 Huilo Huilo
The Huilo Huilo Biological Reserve 
is a private protected area nestled 
among the Patagonian Andes in 
the South of Chile, where the com-
pany, together with the Huilo Huilo 
Foundation, has conservation and 
social development programs. The 
program encompasses a 360° plan, 
through environmental education 
and awareness projects for the two 
schools of Neltume, training of -
fered to the Neltume craftswomen, 
and tour operators, to provide so-
cial development tools. Moreover, 
the company is part of the Huemul 
(Andean deer) Project, in order for 
the national symbol of Chile to re-
turn to the southern forests. 
2 Torres del Paine 
The Torres del Paine National Park, located in the Chil-
ean Patagonia, is one of the most important protect -
ed wildlife areas in the country. In collaboration with the 
Tu Mejor Huella (your best footprint) organization, the 
company began the project of rebuilding the first sus-
tainable trail in the country, which is currently eroded due 
to weather conditions and the over 250 thousand tourists 
who visit the 8th wonder of the world every year. The ini-
tiative is possible thanks to the collaboration of passen-
gers, workers, and the public-private initiative.ARGENTINACHILE

health in the communities where it operates. The 
program provides integral scholarships to young 
people from state schools, who dream of be-
coming chefs, so they can study in the Pachacu-
tec Foundation’s Cooking school. This institution 
is one of the most renowned in the country, as it 
works with the most renowned cooks of the Acu-
rio Restaurants. 
Through this scholarship, LATAM has linked gas -
tronomy to the eradication of anemia and malnu -
trition. For the duration of the scholarship, mo -
bile clinics will be implemented for children in 1st 
grade in the school where the scholarship holder 
studied, where screenings will be performed, the 
corresponding treatments will be provided, and 
training will be offered. After 2.5 years, and in ad -
dition to obtaining a technical degree in cooking, 
LATAM will provide the certificate of eradication of 
anemia and malnutrition to the benefited group.The total contributed in the region is over 
US$2.6 million  
in 10 years of the program.Second flight   
LATAM generates socioenvironmental impact by taking care of textile 
waste produced by uniform changes. The process began with the do-
nation of disused items by our collaborators. The SISAN craftswomen, 
allied to LATAM in the project, created new products with original designs 
of the Pachacamac iconographies using the fabric from the uniforms. 
Throughout the process, they were assisted by another ally, social com-
pany Kani, which was in charge of training the craftswomen and design-
ing the products. Last, to achieve a greater scope, LATAM added SISAN 
as a LATAM supplier and included the products in the LATAM Pass cata-
log, so they can be exchanged by clients, achieving a 360° impact.

The Solidary Plane is a Corporate Citizenship pro-
gram of LATAM Airlines Group, in existence since 
2012, which has the structure, connectivity, and 
transportation capacity for its passenger and car -
go business in benefit of Latin America (LATAM 
AIRLINES y LATAM CARGO). The initiative is trans-
versal to the company, and expands the scope 
and impact of the assistance with the synergy of 
both businesses.
The Solidary Plan has two fields of action; health-
care needs and catastrophe, and although it ap-
plies both to the passenger and cargo transporta-
tion businesses, its activation and regulation can 
be differentiated based on the type of business.In a new action strategy, Solidary Plane Health fo-
cuses not only on transporting patients that need 
medical treatment, but also on the campaigns of 
multidisciplinary teams to serve the low-income 
communities. During 2019, the program donated 
over 4 thousand tickets.
The Solidary Plane Catastrophe, which is activat -
ed following a natural disaster, serves requests 
from government and non-government agencies, 
to meet the needs that arise in the aftermath of 
events affecting the community, transporting af -
fected people, teams to help and meet the needs, 
and humanitarian help. 
In 2019, through the US affiliate, LATAM adapt -
ed the flight of the Miami (US)-Bogota (Colombia) 
route to transport 35 tons of medicines, medical 
equipment, food, and other items to the Bahamas, 
which were struck in September by hurricane Dorian. 
To deliver the products, the flight stopped in Nas-
sau, capital of the Caribbean nation. In November, 
through LATAM Argentina, upon request from the 
Red Cross, LATAM also ensured transportation to 
Bolivia of 260 kilos of a product that makes water 
potable and tickets were donated.Over 4 
thousand  
tickets donated on the Solidary 
Plane Health 2019.
ANIMAL RESCUE PROGRAM
With the aim to safeguard the wellbeing of Lat -
in American fauna, LATAM Cargo has the Animal 
Rescue program, which offers its experience and 
capacity to transport to sanctuaries animals at risk, 
in danger of extinction, or in need of rehabilitation. 
In 2019, 93 animals were transported. LATAM also 
contributed to the transportation of cargo during 
the oil spill that reached the Brazilian coastline.FOSTER THE TRANSPORTATION 
OF ORGANS AND TISSUES
Since 2013, LATAM Brazil collaborates with 
the Ministry of Health and places its logistic 
capacity at their disposal to transport organs 
and tissues; also, this is currently one of the 
fields of action of the Solidary Plane program.
Reflected in the Brazilian experience, LATAM’s 
Solidary Plane seeks to consolidate as the air -
line group that transports the most organs and 
tissues in South America as of 2020. During 
2019, it reviewed the internal guidelines and 
has been holding talks with the health au-
thorities of the Spanish-speaking countries 
where it operates to enable agreements and 
collaborations. LATAM also expects to gener -
ate awareness in society so organ and tissue 
donations will increase in South America and 
more lives can be saved.

the impact
In addition to the Solidary Plane 
program, LATAM also uses 
its logistics capacity and its 
broad connection network for 
other actions, which generate a 
positive impact for society.TRANSPORTATION OF RECYCLABLES
LATAM transports recyclable materials for free in 
island environments, as a way of collaborating with 
the challenge of reverse logistics and the proper 
management of waste. The Group also fosters de-
bates to identify long-term sustainable solutions, 
which involve the authorities and the industrial 
sector. 
The oldest initiative is found on Easter Island, in 
the Pacific Ocean, a six-hour flight away from the 
Chilean capital. The materials are marketed and the 
resulting revenues are invested in environmental 
preservation projects in the locality.
In 2017, the Group signed an agreement with the 
Island of San Andres, in Colombia, to enable the 
transportation of recyclable materials—particularly 
used tires—to the capital, Bogota.DONATIONS TRANSPORTATION
In Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, LATAM transported 
used notebooks, clothes, food, and water for dona -
tion throughout the year. In Brazil and Peru, it also 
carried out the donation of items that were found in 
abandoned cargoes and baggage.
VOLUNTEER WORK
Throughout the year, the company holds sever -
al volunteer programs in South America, as part 
of its Corporate Citizenship strategy, where em -
ployees donate part of their time to participate 
in campaigns, to be part of the projects of foun -
dations and organizations that need assistance 
to achieve their goals. In 2019, volunteer work to -
taled over 6 thousand hours.
An activity developed by volunteers was the refor -
estation of 1,000 native trees, performed on Cerro 
Renca, as part of the project to reforest the future 
green lung of Santiago (Chile). Annually, LATAM’s 
volunteers are mobilized through the “Un Día en 
LATAM” (A Day at LATAM) program, where the 
Group opens its doors to receive students from 
various regions around the country. In 2019, it re -
ceived visits from over 5 thousand children and 
teenagers, who are offered a tour of the facilities 
of the Maintenance Base and receive educational talks regarding the world of aviation. The volun -
teers participate in roundtable discussions with 
the visitors.
In Brazil, several initiatives carried out by agencies 
and foundations were aided by the LATAM team 
of professionals, who collaborated with prepar -
ing food baskets, participated in the distribution 
of soup to homeless people, and acted as teach -
ers instructing public school kids on citizenship, 
among other actions. In the Brazilian affiliate, one 
of the most traditional projects is carried out to -
gether with NGO Make-a-Wish, which takes chil -
dren with serious illnesses to their favorite desti -
nation anywhere in the world.204 tons 
of recyclable materials were 
transported from island regions 
by LATAM in 2019.

Approved by the Board in 2017, LATAM’s Do-
nations Policy sets the general rules (criteria, 
validation stages, and validating agencies) that 
must guide the cash and service contributions 
made at all its operations. In 2019, the docu-
ment was subjected to a new update to ensure 
that even specific donations are in line with 
LATAM’s goal of contributing to the long-term 
development of the regions. 
Money transfers to foundations, NGOs, and 
other civil society organizations are allowed, 
as are donations of tickets and miles, in addi-
tion to free cargo transportation. In the case 
of donations including cash contributions, the 
Board must approve any over US$25 thousand. For values between US$5 thousand and US$25 
thousand, the Executive Committee must 
authorize the donation and, for values un-
der US$5 thousand, the approval is left to the 
vice-presidency of Corporate Affairs.
Donations must meet all the legal and compli-
ance standards. The Corporate Affairs and Legal 
Affairs departments of each affiliate monitor 
the process of all donations and any irregularity 
is reported to the Compliance Department. All 
contracts signed with LATAM include an anticor -
ruption clause.

[102-46, 102-50 and 102-56]
In the 2019 Annual Report, LATAM presents the 
main results and challenges of the year, as well as 
its outlook for the business in the short, medium, 
and long term, considering the connection between 
financial and non-financial information. Through-
out the publication, LATAM seeks to show how its 
strategy, management and governance structure, 
and the performance of its activities generate value 
for the business and its stakeholders over time.
This was the second year in which the report fol-
lowed the integrated reporting principles of the In-
ternational Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and 
the GRI standards (Global Reporting Initiative). The 
publication is also aligned to the legal and account -
ing standards that apply to annual reports on fi-
nancial results. The information covers all the com-
panies in the LATAM Airlines Group, and concerns 
the period from January 1 to December 31, 2019.Deloitte (see page 117) was in charge of auditing the 
contents and indicators based on the GRI Standards 
regarding the organization’s profile and the materi-
al indicators of the economic, social, and environ-
mental dimensions. PwC (see page 125) audited the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of LATAM Air -
lines Group and its affiliates, which include the con-
solidated financial statements as at December 31, 
2019 and 2018, available starting on page 164.

 MATERIAL TOPICS [102-40, 102-42 and 102-43]
The 2019 Integrated Report includes the contents 
related to the most relevant topics for the busi-
ness, defined in the most recent materiality pro-
cess, completed early in 2018. During the process, 
the main economic, environmental, and social im-
pacts of the business were analyzed, and various 
LATAM stakeholders were surveyed. The survey 
of employees, clients, and suppliers alone totaled 
close to 2,400 answers. 
After gathering the data, the most relevant (ma-
terial) topics were prioritized, considering a com-
parison of the level of relevance (stakeholders’ 
view) and the level of impact (view of LATAM senior 
management and material topics identified by the 
SASB). Lastly, the materiality matrix was validated 
by the CEO.
The matrix comprises ten material topics. The pub-
lication shows how the Group manages each topic 
and the performance achieved in 2019, measured 
through GRI and SASB indicators, and other moni-
toring systems that LATAM has adopted.
In a transversal approach to the material topics, its 
management also includes monitoring aspects such 
as management with ecoefficiency, reduction of 
noise and other emissions, and value chain.10 topics 
considered the most relevant 
make up the current LATAM 
materiality matrix.

with the aim to induce the receiver to abuse their position, regardless of whether the corrupt act

INDEPENDENT REVISION REPORT OF LATAM
INTEGRATED REPORT 2019
Mr.
Enrique Guzmán
Sustainability Senior Manager
Present 
Dear Mr. Guzmán,
Please find herein the outcomes of the revision of 
LATAM´s Integrated Report 2019 according to the 
following aspects:
Scope
Limited assurance engagement of the adherence 
of the contents and indicators included in the 2019 
Integrated Report to the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) Standards, regarding the organization’s profile 
and material indicators arising from the materiali-
ty process that the Company carried out following 
said Standards related to the economic, social, and 
environmental dimensions.      
 
Standards and Assurance Process
We have carried out our task in accordance with the 
guidelines of the International Standard on Assur -
ance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000) issued 
by the International Auditing and Assurance Stan-
dard Board (IAASB) of the International Federation 
of Accountants (IFAC).
Our review has consisted in an inquiry process in-
volving different LATAM units and management 
areas, involved in the process of developing the Re-
port, as well as in the application of analytic proce-
dures and verification tests, which are described in 
the following items:
• Meeting with Sustainability management.
• Requirements and review of evidence with the areas 
participating in the preparation of the 2019 Integrated 
Report.
• Analysis of the adherence of the contents of the 
2019 Integrated Report to the GRI Standards: Core 
option, and review of the indicators included in the 
report in order to verify that they are aligned with the 
protocols established in the Standards, and whether 
the fact that some indicators are not applicable or not 
material is justified.
• Verification, through tests of quantitative and qual-
itative information corresponding to the GRI Stan-
dards indicators included in the 2019 Report, and its 
adequate gathering from the data provided by LATAM 
information sources.Conclusions
• The assurance process was based on the indicators 
established in the materiality process carried out by 
LATAM. Once those indicators were identified, priori-
tized, and validated, they were included in the report. 
The reported and verified indicators appear in the 
following table:
 
102-1 102-2 102-3 102-4 102-5 102-6 102-7
102-8 102-9 102-10 102-11 102-12 102-13 102-14
102-16 102-17 102-18 102-40 102-42 102-43 102-44
102-45 102-46 102-47 102-48 102-49 102-50 102-51
102-52 102-53 102-54 102-55 102-56 103-1 201-1
201-2 203-1 203-2 205-2 205-3 206-1 302-1
302-3 302-4 303-1 305-1 305-2 305-3 305-4
305-5 305-6 305-7 306-2 307-1 401-1 403-2
404-1 415-1 417-3 419-1
 
 
• Regarding the verified indicators, we can say that no 
aspect has arisen to lead us to believe that the In -
tegrated Report 2019 LATAM has not been prepared 
in accordance with the GRI Standards in those areas 
identified in the scope.
Improvement Opportunities Report
In addition to this letter, Deloitte is presenting to 
LATAM a special report including improvement op-
portunities to reinforce management aspects, and 
the Company's abilitity to draft future Integrated 
Reports.LATAM Management and Deloitte Responsibilities
• The drafting of the 2019 Integrated Report, as well 
as its contents are under LATAM responsibility, which 
is in charge of the definition, adaptation, and main-
tenance of the management and internal control 
systems from who the information is obtained.
• Our responsibility is to issue an independent report 
based on the procedures applied in our review.
• This report has been prepared exclusively by 
LATAM's request, in accordance with the terms estab-
lished in the Engagement Letter.
• We have developed our work according to the 
standards of Independence established in the Code of 
Ethics of the IFAC. 
• The conclusions of the verification made by Deloitte 
apply to the latest version of the LATAM Integrated 
Report received on April 06, 2020.
• The scope of a limited assurance engagement is 
essentially inferior to a reasonable assurance engage-
ment, thus, we are not hereby providing opinion about 
the 2019 LATAM Integrated Report.

SHAREHOLDERS’ AGREEMENT
Following the combination between LAN and TAM 
in June 2012, LAN Airlines S.A. was transformed 
into "LATAM Airlines Group S.A." and TAM contin-
ues to exist as a subsidiary Holdco I and LATAM. In 
order to execute this combination, TAM’s controlling 
shareholders created four new closely-held stock 
companies pursuant to Chilean law: TEP Chile, 
Holdco I, Holdco II and Sister Holdco. Upon execu-
tion of the above-referred transaction, Holdco II 
and Sister Holdco ceased to exist.
Prior to such business combination, LATAM Air -
lines Group and its controlling shareholders execut -
ed several shareholders’ agreements with TAM, its 
shareholders (acting through TEP Chile) and Hold-
co I, thus establishing agreements and restrictions 
related to corporate governance in an attempt to 
balance the interests of the LATAM Airlines Group, 
as the owner of substantially all economic rights 
in TAM, and TAM’s controlling shareholders, as the 
continuing controlling shareholders of TAM pur -
suant to Brazilian law. In order to achieve these 
objectives, the various shareholders’ agreements 
prohibited undertaking certain actions and mak-
ing important corporate decisions without the prior 
approval of a qualified majority of its shareholders 
and/or the Board of Directors of Holdco I or TAM. 
Moreover, these shareholders’ agreements also es-
tablish the parties’ covenants regarding the gov-ernance and management of the LATAM Airlines 
Group, subsequent to the combination of LAN and 
TAM businesses.
The LATAM Group’s governance and management
Insofar as the governance and management of 
the LATAM Group is concerned, there are different 
shareholders’ agreements:
1.  Shareholders’ agreement of the controlling group: 
executed between the controlling shareholders 
of LATAM and TEP Chile, establishing agreements 
with respect to the corporate governance, control 
and operation of LATAM, Holdco I, TAM and their 
respective subsidiaries. It also governs the votes 
and transfers of the ordinary shares of the LATAM 
Airlines Group and the voting shares of Holdco I 
owned by TEP Chile.
2.  Shareholders’ agreement between the LATAM Air -
lines Group and TEP: executed between LATAM and 
TEP Chile; wherein, among other subject matters, 
it establishes agreements regarding the corporate

4.  Shareholders’ agreement of TAM: executed be-
tween LATAM, Holdco I, TAM and TEP Chile, es-
tablishing the agreements related to the corpo-
rate governance, management and operation of 
TAM and its subsidiaries.
Following the combination of the business of LAN 
and TAM, the Holdco I and the TAM shareholders’ 
agreements establish the covenants between the 
parties with respect to the governance and man-
agement of Holdco I, TAM and its subsidiaries (col-
lectively, the “TAM Group”).
Following are the key provisions of the Shareholders’ 
agreements referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above. 
It is important to note, however, that the rights and 
obligations of the members of the Controlling Group 
are indeed governed by the terms and conditions of 
such shareholders’ agreements and not by the sum-
mary of any of such agreements contained in this 
integrated report.
Board membership of the LATAM  Airlines Group
Since April 2017, there no restrictions in the Share-
holders agreement in regards to the Board Member of LATAM Airlines Group. Once chosen the board mem-
bers, in compliance with the Chilean regulation, LATAM 
Airlines Group’s board has the right to designate any 
of its members as the Chairman thereof, in compli-
ance the governing statues. Thereby, in May 2017, Mr. 
Ignacio Cueto Plaza was voted Chairman of the Board. 
In April 2017, Mr. Mauricio Amaro left the Board of 
LATAM Airlines Group, with Mr. Henri Philippe Reich-
stul being re-elected as board member in April 2017 
with the votes of TEP Chile S.A., in compliance with 
the local regulation.
Management of the LATAM  Airlines Group
In June 2012, Enrique Cueto Plaza became LATAM’s 
CEO ("LATAM CEO"). The position of LATAM CEO is 
the top-ranking position in the LATAM Airlines Group, 
who reports directly to the LATAM’s Board of Direc -
tors. The LATAM CEO is in charge of overall super -
vision, direction and control of the LATAM Airlines 
Group’s business and certain other responsibilities 
set forth in the Shareholders’ Agreement of the 
LATAM Airlines Group and TEP. Upon the eventual 
departure of LATAM’s current CEO, the LATAM Board 
of Directors will appoint his successor after receiving 
a recommendation from the Leadership Committee.
The main headquarters of the LATAM Airlines Group 
are still located in Santiago, Chile.
Following are the key provisions of the Shareholders’ 
agreements referred to in the preceding paragraphs 
3 and 4. It is important to note, however, that the 
rights and obligations of the members of the Con-trolling Group are indeed governed by the terms and 
conditions of such shareholders’ agreements and not 
by the summary of any of such agreements con-
tained in this integrated report.
Board membership of HOLDCO  I and TAM
The shareholders’ agreement of Holdco I and the 
shareholders’ agreement of TAM provide, in gener -
al terms, identical board memberships and the same 
Holdco I and TAM CEO; whereupon LATAM appoints 
two board members and TAM appoints four board 
members (including the Chairman of the Board).
Maria Cláudia Oliveira Amaro resigned from her po-
sition as board member on September 8, 2014 and 
in her replacement, the Board appointed, Mr. Henri 
Philippe Reichstul. TAM’s Board membership was to-
tally renewed on April 2015.
The shareholders’ agreement of the controlling group 
establishes that the persons elected by or on behalf 
of LATAM’s controlling shareholders or TAM’s con-
trolling shareholders, as board members of LATAM’s 
Board of Directors, will also serve as members of the 
Board of Directors of Holdco I and TAM. 
Management of HOLDCO  I and TAM
The affairs and day-to-day business of Holdco I 
shall be managed by the CEO of the TAM Group 
under the supervision of the Board of Directors of 
Holdco I. The affairs and dayto-day business of 
TAM will be managed by the Board of Directors of 
TAM under the supervision of the Board of Direc -tors of TAM. The "TAM Board" shall be comprised 
of the TAM Group’s CEO, TAM’s CFO, TAM’s COO 
and TAM’s CCO. Currently, the position of TAM CEO 
is being performed by Ms. Claudia Sender. The TAM 
Group’s CEO will be in charge of overall supervision, 
direction and control over the business and opera -
tions of the TAM Group (on matters not related to 
the LATAM Group’s international passenger busi -
ness) and will perform all orders and resolutions is -
sued by TAM board members. The initial TAM CEO, 
“CFO of TAM’S CFO” has been jointly appointed 
by LATAM and TEP Chile and any successor of the 
CFO shall be designated by TEP Chile from among 
three candidates proposed by LATAM. The TAM 
COO, “TAM’s COO” , and the commercial manag -
er of TAM, “TAM’s CCO” , shall be jointly appointed 
and recommended to TAM’s Board of Directors by 
the CEO of the TAM Group and TAM’s CFO; addi -
tionally, he/she must be approved by TAM’s Board 
of Directors. These shareholders’ agreements also 
govern the composition of the board of directors 
of TAM’s subsidiaries.
Following the combination, TAM still has its main 
headquarters located in São Paulo, Brazil.
Actions requiring qualified majority votes
Certain actions of Holdco I or TAM require approval 
by a qualified majority of the board or the share-
holders of Holdco I or TAM; which, indeed require 
the approval of LATAM and TEP Chile before such 
actions can be carried out.

The controlling group of LATAM and TEP Chile has 
agreed, in the Shareholders’ Agreement of the 
Controlling Group, to vote their respective ordinary 
LATAM Airlines Group shares as follows:
• until that moment, TEP Chile sells any of its ordinary 
LAN shares (other than the exempt shares, as defined 
herein below, and owned by TEP Chile), the Controlling 
Group of LATAM Airlines Group will vote its ordinary 
LATAM Airlines Group shares to elect to the Board of 
Directors of LATAM Airlines Group any person designat -
ed by TEP Chile, unless TEP Chile owns enough ordinary 
shares of LATAM Airlines Group in order to directly elect 
two board members of the LATAM Airlines Group;
• the parties agree to vote their ordinary LATAM Airlines 
Group shares to support the other parties in removing 
or replacing board members or others designated by 
the Board of LATAM Airlines Group;
• the parties agree to consult among them and make 
use of their good faith efforts to achieve agreements 
and act jointly in all actions (except in those actions 
that require majority approval pursuant to the Chilean law) and be considered by the Board of Directors of 
the LATAM Airlines Group or by the shareholders of the 
LATAM Airlines Group;
• the parties agree to maintain the size of the Board of 
Directors of the LATAM Airlines Group at a total of nine 
(9) board members and maintain the quorum required 
by the majority of the Board of Directors of the LATAM 
Airlines Group; and
• in case that, after endeavoring in good faith efforts 
aimed at reaching an agreement with respect to any 
action requiring a qualified majority vote pursuant to 
the Chilean law and a period of mediation, the par -
ties do not reach such agreement, then, TEP Chile has 
agreed to give its vote to the subject matter requiring 
a qualified majority vote as indicated by the controlling 
shareholders of the LATAM Airlines Group; which we 
refer to as “direct vote” . 
The number of TEP Chile “exempt shares” means 
that the number of ordinary shares of the LATAM 
Airlines Group that TEP Chile owns immediately af -
ter the effective date in excess of 12.5% of the valid 
ordinary shares of LATAM Airlines Group shall be de-
termined on the basis of a total dilution.
The parties to the Holdco I shareholders’ agreement 
and to the TAM shareholders’ agreement have agreed 
to vote their Holdco I voting shares and TAM shares 
so as to make effective the agreements related to the 
above-discussed representation of the board of direc -
tors of TAM.Restrictions to the transfers
Pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement of the 
Controlling Group, the controlling shareholders of 
the LATAM Airlines Group and TEP Chile are subject 
to certain restrictions regarding the sale, trans-
fer and encumbrance of the ordinary shares of the 
LATAM Airlines Group and (only in the case of TEP 
Chile) the voting shares of Holdco I. With the ex -
ception of a limited amount of the ordinary shares 
of the LATAM Airlines Group, neither the controlling 
shareholders of the LATAM Airlines Group nor those 
of TEP Chile are authorized to sell the ordinary sha-
res of the LATAM Airlines Group, nor can TEP Chile 
sell its shareholding rights to Holdco I until June 
2015. Subsequently, the sale of the ordinary shares 
of the LATAM Airlines Group by any of the parties 
shall be allowed, subject to (i) certain limitations 
of volume and frequency of such sale, and (ii) only 
in the case of TEP Chile, the latter company must 
meet certain minimum property ownership require-
ments. After June 2022, TEP Chile shall be entit -
led to sell all its shares of the LATAM Airlines Group 
and shareholding rights over Holdco I in one blo-
ck, subject to the following conditions: (i) LATAM 
Board’s approval of the assignee; (ii) that the sale 
does not have an adverse effect; and (iii) that the 
preferred purchase option be in favor of the con-
trolling shareholders of the LATAM Airlines Group; 
conditions to which we refer, collectively, as “block 
sale provisions” . An “adverse effect” is so defined 
in the Shareholders’ Agreement of the Controlling 
Group as a significant adverse effect in the capa-
city of Holdco I to receive the total benefits of the property ownership of TAM and its subsidiaries in 
order to operate the airline business worldwide. The 
controlling group of the LATAM Airlines Group has 
agreed to transfer all the voting shares of Holdco 
I acquired pursuant to LATAM’s preferred purchase 
option, for the same price paid for such shares.
Additionally, TEP Chile is entitled to sell as of June 
2015 all the ordinary shares of the LATAM Airli-
nes Group and voting shares of Holdco I, subject 
to meeting the block sale clause, should a libera-
tion event (as described previously) should occur 
or if TEP Chile is required to exercise one or more 
directed votes during any 24-month period in two 
(consecutive or not) shareholders’ meetings of 
the LATAM Airlines Group held at least 12 months 
apart, and if the LATAM Airlines Group would not 
have totally exercised the conversion of options 
described previously. A “disclosure event” will occur 
if: (i) there is a capital increase of the LATAM Air -
lines Group; (ii) TEP Chile does not exercise all its 
preferred rights granted pursuant to the applicable 
Chilean law with respect to the capital increase in 
relation to all of LATAM Airlines Group’s restricted 
ordinary shares; and, (iii) after completing the capi-
tal increase, the person designated by TEP Chile for 
the voting of the Board of Directors of the LATAM 
Airlines Group with the collaboration of the Con-
trolling Group of the LATAM Airlines Group, is not 
elected as board member of the LATAM Airlines 
Group.

cribed below under Section “Conversion option”), 
TEP Chile could sell all or part of its LATAM Airli-
nes Group’s ordinary shares, subject to: (i) the pre-
ferred option right in favor of LATAM’s controlling 
shareholders; and (ii) the restrictions to the sale of 
ordinary shares of the LATAM Airlines Group more 
than once during a 12-month period.
The shareholders’ agreement of the controlling 
group provides certain exceptions to these transfer 
restrictions for certain pledged shares of the LATAM 
Airlines Group realized by the parties and for trans-
fers to subsidiary companies, in each case open to 
certain limited circumstances. 
Additionally, TEP Chile accepted, in the Sharehol-
ders’ Agreement of Holdco I, not to vote its Holdco 
I voting shares, or take any action in support of any 
transfer on the part of Holdco I of shares or con-
vertible securities into shares issued by them or by 
TAM or by any of its subsidiaries without LATAM’s 
prior written consent.Restrictions to TAM shares transfers
LIn the Shareholders’ Agreement of Holdco I, LATAM 
agreed not to sell or transfer TAM shares to any per -
son (other than our subsidiaries), for as long as TEP 
Chile owns Holdco I voting shares. Without prejudice 
of the foregoing, LATAM shall be entitled to carry out 
such sales or transfers if, simultaneously with such 
sales or transfers, LATAM (or its assignee) would ac -
quire all of Holdco I’s voting shares owned by TEP 
Chile for an amount equal to TEP Chile’s then in ef -
fect taxable base with respect to such shares and 
pay any cost in which TEP Chile might have to incur 
in order to carry out such sale or transfer. TEP Chile 
has irrevocable assigned to LATAM the assignable 
right to acquire all of Holdco I’s voting shares owned 
by TEP Chile related to such sale.
Conversion option
Pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement of the 
Controlling Group and the Shareholders’ Agreement 
of Holdco I, LATAM is unilaterally entitled to convert 
our non-voting Holdco I shares into Holdco I voting 
shares up to the maximum allowed by law, and to 
increase our representation in the Boards of Direc -
tors of both TAM and Holdco I as permitted by the 
Brazilian laws that govern foreign property owner -
ships and by other applicable laws if the conversion 
would not have an adverse effect (as previously de-
fined in the section on “Transfer Restrictions”).During or after June 2022, and after LATAM would 
have totally converted all its Holdco I non-vot -
ing shares into Hold I voting shares, as allowed by 
Brazilian laws and other applicable laws, LATAM 
shall be entitled to acquire all of Holdco I’s voting 
shares owned by TAM’s controlling shareholders for 
an amount equal to their taxable base with respect 
to such shares and pay any cost that might be in-
curred in order to materialize such sale; an amount 
to which we shall refer as “sale consideration” . If 
LATAM does not exercise its right to acquire such 
shares on a timely basis, or if, after June 2022 
LATAM should be entitled, pursuant to Brazilian 
laws and other applicable laws, to convert all of 
Holdco I’s non-voting shares into Holdco I voting 
shares, and if such conversion would not have an 
adverse effect but we would not have exercised 
such right fully and totally during a specific period 
of time, then, the controlling shareholders of TAM 
would be entitled to offer us their Holdco I voting 
shares for an amount equal to the sale price.
Acquisition of TAM’s shares
The parties hereto have agreed that all acquisi-
tions of TAM’s ordinary shares by the LATAM Air -
lines Group, Holdco I, TAM or any of their respec -
tive subsidiaries as of and after the effective date 
of business combination shall be carried out by 
Holdco I. Insofar as the main organs of Corporate Governance of the LATAM Airlines Group are con-
cerned, they are: the Board of Directors and the Di-
rectors’ Committee (which, additionally, embodies 
the functions of Audit Committee for the purposes 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of the United States of 
America), along with the Committees of Strategy, 
Finance, Leadership and Product, Brand and Fre-
quent Flyer Program created following the associ-
ation between LAN and TAM. The main powers of 
such corporate organs are specified below.Ownership structure

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsSuS tAINAbIlIty REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
Chilean aeronautical regulation
Both the General Directorate of Civil Aviation 
(“DGAC”) and the Civil Aviation Board (“JAC“) super -
vise and regulate the Chilean aviation industry. The 
DGAC answers directly to the Chilean Air Force and 
it is in charge of supervising compliance with the 
Chilean laws and standards that rule air navigation. 
The JAC is the Chilean civil aviation authority.
Essentially by virtue of Decree Law N° 2,564, which 
regulates commercial aviation, the JAC establish-
es the main commercial policies for the aeronauti-
cal industry in Chile, and regulates the allocation of 
domestic and international routes, and the DGAC 
regulates flight operations, including personnel, air -
craft, security levels, air traffic control, and airport 
administration.
LATAM Airlines Group S.A. has obtained and main-
tains the necessary authorization required by the 
Chilean government to conduct flight operations, 
including authorization certificates from the JAC 
and technical operative certificates from the DGAC, 
the continuation of which is subject to the ongoing 
compliance with applicable statutes, rules, and reg-ulations pertaining to the airline industry, including 
any rules and regulations that may be adopted in 
the future.
Chile is a contracting state, as well as a permanent 
member of the International Civil Aviation Organi-
zation (ICAO), a UN institution established in 1947 
in order to assist in the planning and development 
of international air transportation. ICAO establishes 
technical guidelines for the international aeronauti-
cal industry, which have been incorporated into the 
Chilean laws and rules by the country’s authorities. 
Given the lack of Chilean rules applicable to the is-
sues related to security or maintenance, DGAC has 
incorporated most of the ICAO technical guidelines 
through referencing. We are certain that we comply 
with all relevant technical guidelines.
Route rights
• National Routes
Chilean airlines are not required to obtain per -
mits in order to carry passengers or cargo on any 
domestic routes, but they must comply with the 
technical and insurance requirements established 
respectively by the DGAC and the JAC. Moreover, 
there are no regulatory barriers that would prevent 
a foreign airline from creating a Chilean subsidiary 
and entering the Chilean domestic market using 
that subsidiary. On January 18, 2012, the Chil -
ean Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry 
of Economy announced the unilateral opening of 
Chile’s national skies. This was confirmed in No -
vember 2013 and remains valid.• International Routes
Given that it is an airline offering service on inter -
national routes, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. is also 
subject to a series of bilateral civil air transporta-
tion agreements that consider the reciprocity of air 
traffic rights between Chile and the countries where 
LATAM maintains operations.
There is no guarantee that the bilateral agree -
ments currently in force between Chile and these 
foreign governments will remain valid, and an 
amendment, suspension, or revocation of one or 
more bilateral treaties could damage our opera -
tions and financial results.
International route rights, as well as the corre-
sponding landing rights, are derived from a series of 
air transportation agreements negotiated between 
Chile and foreign governments. By virtue of these 
agreements, the government of each of the coun-
tries grants the other government the right to ap-
point the operation of scheduled services between 
certain destinations of that country to one or more 
of its domestic airlines.
In Chile, when routes to or from foreign cities are 
opened, all airlines that meet the necessary re-
quirements may request the use of those routes. 
When there is more than one applicant, on those 
routes with a restriction on capacity, the JAC 
awards the frequencies for a period of five years 
through a public tender. The JAC awards the use of 
routes on condition that the airline to which they are awarded will operate them permanently. Should 
an airline cease to operate a route for a period of 
six months or longer, the JAC may revoke their 
rights on that route. It is possible to transfer the 
use of international routes at no cost. In the past, 
we have paid fees for the right to use the interna-
tional routes awarded in public tenders where there 
was more than one applicant.
Airfare-setting policies
Chilean airlines can set their own national and in-
ternational fares without any form of Government 
regulation. 
In 1997, Resolution N° 496 of the Resolution 
Commission (predecessor of the Chilean Compe-
tition Tribunal, TDLC), approved a self-regulating 
fare plan presented by LATAM for our national op-
erations in Chile.
Said plan was presented in compliance with the 
provisions issued in 1995 in Resolution N° 445 by 
the Resolution Commission. In general terms, ac -
cording to this plan, we must ensure that the yields 
of the routes defined as “non-competitive” by said 
Resolution N° 445 dated 1995 are no greater than 
the yields for similar-distance routes defined as 
“competitive” by the same resolution; and inform

The Chilean Aeronautics Code (“CAC”) regulates 
aircraft registration in Chile. For an aircraft to get 
registered or remain registered in Chile, the owner 
must be:
• An individual of Chilean nationality.
• A legal entity constituted in Chile whose main ad-
dress and real and effective headquarters are in Chile, 
and most of whose share capital is held by Chilean 
individuals or companies, besides the other require-
ments established in Article 38 of the CAC.
• The Aeronautics Code expressly enables the DGAC 
to allow the registration of aircrafts whose owners are 
not Chilean individuals or companies, as long as they 
have a permanent business address in Chile. Aircrafts 
whose owners are not Chilean but are operated by 
Chileans or by an airline affiliated to a Chilean aviation 
entity may also be registered.
• The registration of any aircraft can be revoked 
should it not meet the registration requirements, 
particularly in the following cases.• The ownership requirements are not met.
• The aircraft does not comply with any of the appli-
cable security requirements specified by the DGAC.
Prevention
The DGAC requires all aircrafts operated by Chil-
ean airlines to be registered before the DGAC or 
some other equivalent agency acting as a supervi-
sor in any other country. All aircrafts must have an 
airworthiness certificate, either issued by the DGAC 
or by some equivalent non-Chilean agency that has 
supervision powers. On the other hand, the DGAC 
does not issue maintenance permits to a Chilean 
airline until the agency has assessed the airline’s 
capacities to perform the maintenance. 
The DGAC renews maintenance permits annually 
and it has approved all our maintenance operations. 
Only the maintenance facilities that have a certif -
icate from the DGAC or an equivalent non-Chil-
ean agency with supervision powers in the country 
where the aircraft is registered may perform main-
tenance services and repairs on the aircrafts oper -
ated by Chilean airlines.
Likewise, the staff of the aircraft maintenance 
facilities must have a certificate from the DGAC 
or an equivalent non-Chilean agency with super -
vision powers in the country where the aircraft is 
registered prior to taking any position of aircrafts 
maintenance.Security
The DGAC establishes and supervises the imple-
mentation of security standards and rules for the 
Chilean commercial aviation industry. 
These standards and rules are based on the stan -
dards developed by the international commer -
cial aviation organizations. Each airline and airport 
in Chile must present to the DGAC an air security 
manual describing the security procedures imple -
mented in their daily commercial air operations, as 
well as the personnel training procedures on the 
matter of security. LATAM has presented its air se -
curity manual to the DGAC. Chilean airlines op -
erating international routes must adopt security 
measures in compliance with the applicable require -
ments of the international bilateral agreements.
Airport policies
The DGAC supervises and manages the airports in 
Chile, including the supervision of charges of take -
off and landing fees. The DGAC proposes the airport 
fees, which the JAC approves, and they are the same 
for all airports. Since the mid-90s, a series of Chilean 
airports have been privatized, including the Arturo 
Merino Benitez International Airport, in Santiago. In 
the privatized airports, the airport manager manages 
the facilities supervised by the DGAC and JAC.
Environmental and noise regulation
There are no important environmental rules or 
controls imposed on airlines, applicable to the 
airplanes, or affecting us within Chile, except for Industry contextenvironmental laws and generally applicable rules. 
There is currently no rule either that applies to air -
crafts in Chile to restrain noise. However, the Chil-
ean authorities intend to enact a regulation regard-
ing environmental noise to regulate aircrafts flying 
to and within Chile. The regulation proposed will 
require said aircrafts to comply with certain restric -
tions regarding noise, which in the market will be 
denominated Stage 3 standards.
Most of LATAM’s fleet already complies with the 
restrictions proposed; therefore, we do not believe 
that the enactment of these standards proposed 
will suppose a serious burden on our operations.
Antitrust regulation
In Chile, there are two authorities regulating the 
matter. The Competition Tribunal (TDLC, for its 
Spanish acronym) (formerly the Resolution Commis -
sion, and henceforth the “TDLC” or Court), and the 
National Economic Prosecutor’s office (henceforth, 
FNE, for its Spanish acronym). Each one has differ -
ent powers and functions but, jointly, they are in 
charge of supervising compliance with local regula -
tion, which is provided in Decree Law N° 211 from 
1973, and its subsequent amendments (henceforth, 
the Antitrust Law, or the Law). 
The Antitrust Law considers penalties for all organi -
zations that carry out actions that prevent, restrict, 
or hamper free competition, or that aim to produce 
such effects.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  Creditsour buSINESSMoreover, the Law forbids any company holding a 
dominating position within a market from abusively 
exploiting said position.
A damaged person can sue for damages resulting 
from the breach of the Antitrust Law and/or file a 
claim before the Court, in order for the latter to end 
the breach.
The TDLC has the power to levy a series of penalties 
for breaches of D.L. 211, including the rescission of 
contracts, dissolution of legal entities, and levying of 
fines on companies and individuals. It also consid -
ers penalties of imprisonment for those cases where 
collusive practices are perpetrated.
The courts may declare the payment of compensa -
tion for damages, as well as other redresses (such as 
a court injunction) when pertinent. In October 1997, 
the Antitrust Court approved our Self-Regulatory 
Airfare Plan.
Since October 1997, LAN Airlines S.A. y LAN Express 
follow a self-regulatory plan, which was modified and approved by the Competition Court in July 2005, 
and further in September 2011.
In February 2010, the FNE ended the investigation 
that it began in 2007 regarding our fulfillment of the 
self-regulatory plan, and no observations were made.
Through Resolution N° 37 /2011, issued on Septem -
ber 21, 2011, (the “Resolution”), Chile’s TDLC ap -
proved the combination of LAN and TAM, imposing 
14 mitigation measures on LATAM, whose regula -
tion and scope are defined in the Resolution, and 
which are summarized below merely for reference 
purposes:
01  Exchange four pairs of daily slots at the Guarul-
hos Airport in São Paulo, to be used exclusively 
to service the SCL – GRU route, on non-stop 
flights.
02  Extend for a five-year period its frequent fly-
er program to the airlines operating (or stating 
their intention to operate) the Santiago – São 
Paulo, Santiago – Río de Janeiro, Santiago – 
Montevideo, and Santiago – Asunción routes; 
and that request LATAM to extend said program 
for said route(s). The term for this measure has 
expired.
03  Hold interline agreements on the Santiago – 
São Paulo, Santiago – Río de Janeiro, and/or 
Santiago – Asunción routes, with the interest -
ed airlines that operate said routes, and who so 
request.04  Observe certain transitory capacity and offer 
restrictions on the Santiago – São Paulo route.
05  Implement certain modifications to the LATAM 
Self-Regulatory Airfare Plan, applicable to its 
domestic operations.
06  Renounce, prior to June 22, 2014, one of the 
two global alliances that LAN and TAM be-
longed to at the time of the Resolution.
07  Observe certain restrictions in entering and 
maintaining, without prior consultation of the 
TDLC, codeshare agreements on certain routes 
and with airlines that are members or associ-
ates of a different alliance from that to which 
LATAM belongs.
08  Observe certain restrictions in its participation in 
future 3rd, 4th, and 5th freedom traffic rights bid -
dings between Santiago and Lima; and renounce 
(4) four 5th freedom frequencies to Lima.
09  Declare to the air transportation authorities its 
favorable opinion on the unilateral open skies 
for cabotage in Chile by airlines from other 
States, without the need for reciprocity.
10  Commit, in every relevant aspect, to foster the 
growth and normal operation of the airports of 
Guarulhos in São Paulo and Arturo Merino Benítez 
in Santiago.11  Follow certain guidelines in awarding incentives 
to travel agencies.
12  Transitorily, maintain: i) at least 12 nonstop 
roundtrip flights per week, directly operated by 
LATAM on the routes between Chile and the US; 
and ii) at least 7 nonstop roundtrip flights, direct -
ly operated by LATAM on the routes between Chile 
and Europe.
13  Follow certain restrictions in: the average income 
from airfares for passenger transportation, on the 
Santiago—São Paulo—Santiago—Río de Janei -
ro routes; and in the fares, in force and published 
at the time of the Resolution, for cargo traffic on 
each of the routes between Chile and Brazil.
14  Hire an independent consultant, to advise the 
National Economic Prosecutor’s office (Fiscalía 
Nacional Económica) for a 3-year period in super -
vising LATAM’s compliance with the Resolution. 
The term for this measure has expired.
Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defense 
(“CADE”) approved the association of LAN and TAM 
by unanimous decision in the meeting held on De-
cember 14, 2011, subject to the following conditions:
01  The new Group (LATAM) must renounce one of 
the two global alliances in which it participated 
(Star Alliance or oneworld).Industry context

of the Securities Market Law and General Rule No. 
30, duly authorized by the board of LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A. (“ LATAM ” or the “Company”), Securities 
Registration No. 306, I hereby complement the Ma -
terial Fact and respond to the Ordinary Office of the 
reference:• As is public knowledge, on May 23, 2019, the 
Supreme Court accepted the claims filed against 
the decision of Chile’s Free Competition Defense 
Court (TDLC) that ruled on the consultation regard -
ing certain commercial agreements (joint business 
agreements, “JBAs”) subscribed, separately, between 
American Airlines and International Airlines Group 
- the holding company of British Airways and Iberia - 
with the Company.
• The ruling states that “the Joint Business Agree-
ments agreed between LATAM, American Airlines, 
Iberia and British Airways, subject to consultation by 
the court, in all matters relating to air transport of 
passengers are not approved. ”
• As initially reported in January 2016, the imple -
mentation of the JBAs was subject to obtaining the 
approvals of the relevant authorities in the different 
countries where the airlines that form part of such 
agreements operate.
• With the exception of Chile, the approvals to 
implement the JBAs in the other countries relevant 
to the agreements were obtained, pending only the 
process with the Department of Transportation in the 
US regarding the agreement with American Airlines, 
pending this date.
• Attended to this new scenario in Chile, LATAM is 
evaluating the alternatives that may exist to im-
plement the JBAs, without having taken a definitive 
decision to this date. The Company will promptly inform the market and your Commission of any 
relevant development that comes from LATAM with 
respect to the JBAs.

held today, I inform as a Material Fact of LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. (“LATAM Airlines” , “L TM” or the 
“Company”), Securities Registration No. 306, that 
L TM has signed a framework agreement with Delta 
Air Lines, Inc. (“DAL”), whose main terms and con-
ditions are summarized below:
1.  Public Offer of Acquisition of Shares. DAL to 
make a public offer to acquire 20% of the shares 
of L TM (the "Tender Offer"). The Tender Offer will 
be for the price of US$16 per share.
DAL's obligation to launch the Tender Offer is 
subject to compliance with customary conditions 
for these type of transactions, including obtain-
ing the corresponding antitrust authorization in 
the United States of America.The Tender Offer will be subject to the condition 
of success consisting in allowing DAL to acquire 
shares of the Company that represent at least 
15% of the Company’s capital stock. In addition, 
it will contemplate usual objective grounds for 
expiration for operations of this nature.
2.  Strategic Alliance. Independently of the Tender 
Offer and whatever its outcome, L TM and DAL 
agreed to form a strategic alliance (the “Strate -
gic Alliance”) on the non-stop routes between 
the United States of America and Canada, and 
the countries of South America with agreements 
of open skies, and in the connections of these 
routes. The Strategic Alliance also includes the 
joint design of networks, cargo operations, and 
reciprocal codeshare agreements. For these pur -
poses, L TM and DAL have agreed to use their best 
reasonable efforts to sign the final agreements 
on this matter as soon as possible, and in any 
case within 210 days of this date.
It is the intention of L TM and DAL to implement 
the Strategic Alliance simultaneously with re -
spect to all the countries of South America, the 
United States and Canada in which a regulatory 
authorization is not required for its implemen -
tation and/or in which the pertinent regulatory 
authorizations have been obtained. For this pur -
pose, regulatory authorizations will be requested 
from the authorities in all jurisdictions in which 
it is appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

agree to implement the Strategic Alliance only in 
those countries in which the respective authori -
zations have been obtained and in those where 
they are not required.
If the Tender Offer is successful, DAL is obligat -
ed to the following regarding it ownership stake 
in L TM:
• From the date on which the Tender Offer ends 
and until the date of implementation of the Stra -
tegic Alliance as indicated in the previous para -
graph (the “Date of Implementation”), (i) DAL is 
obligated not to increase its participation in the 
Company over 20%; provided, however, that if an 
L TM shareholder (or group of shareholders with a 
common controller) that currently has less than 
a 20% interest in it, acquires shares of the Com -
pany in excess of 20%, DAL may acquire a larg -
er share stake, but in no case in excess of 24.99% 
of the Company's shares; and (ii) DAL is obligated 
not to decrease its participants below 20% or the percentage of shares of the Company actually ac -
quired in the Tender Offer above 15%.
• After the expiration of the aforementioned 
term and until the second anniversary counted 
from the Date of Implementation, DAL will be 
obligated not to increase its participation in the 
Company over 24.99% or to decrease its holding 
below 15%.
• Under no circumstances may DAL sell the 
Company's shares to other airlines based in 
South America, Central America or the Caribbe-
an, unless the transfer is made in the context of 
an open market transaction, or has the consent 
of the Company.
In the event that as of March 31, 2024, the Stra-
tegic Alliance has not entered into effect, DAL is 
obligated to decrease its ownership stake to less 
than 5%. Likewise, in the event that the Strate-
gic Alliance terminates due to DAL’s non-compli-
ance, DAL is obligated not to transfer its shares 
in the Company to other shareholders (or groups 
of shareholders with a common controller) that 
own of 10% or more of the L TM shares.
DAL will compensate L TM for the costs that it 
will incur during the transition period until the 
implementation of the Strategic Alliance, and is 
consequently obligated to pay to the Compa-
ny US$350 million, notwithstanding that in case 
the costs exceed that amount for extraordinary reasons, L TM and DAL must negotiate in good 
faith the potential additional payments that may 
apply. The payment of the US$350 million is not 
conditional on the success of the implementa-
tion of the Strategic Alliance, and must be made 
by DAL according to the following timeline: (i) 
US$150 million within three business days fol-
lowing this date; and (ii) US$200 million, in eight 
quarterly installments of US$25 million each, 
payable as of March 31, 2020.
3.  Aircraft Transfer. Regardless of the operations 
referred to in the preceding paragraphs, L TM and 
DAL have agreed: (i) to sign an aircraft purchase 
agreement, under which, DAL will acquire certain 
aircraft that are part of the L TM fleet; and (ii) 
that DAL will assume the commitment of L TM 
to assign its contractual position under certain 
contracts for the sale of aircraft signed with Air -
bus SAS.
Finally, we note that the Company will termi-
nate its membership in the oneworld alliance and 
will not persevere in the agreement called Joint 
Business Agreement signed with American Air -
lines as made public in the Material Facts dated 
January 14, 2016 and May 27, 2019.
As of this date, the reservation of the communi-

RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY
Our assets include a significant amount of goodwill.     
Our assets included US$2,209.6 million of good -
will as of December 31, 2019. Under IFRS, goodwill 
is subject to an annual impairment test and may 
be required to be tested more frequently if events 
or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. 
In 2019, mainly as a result of the depreciation of 
the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, the value 
of our goodwill decreased by 3.7% as compared 
with 2018. Any impairment could result in the rec -
ognition of a significant charge to earnings in our 
statement of income, which could materially and 
adversely impact our consolidated results for the 
period in which the impairment occurs.
A failure to successfully implement our strategy 
or a failure adjusting the strategy to the current 
economic situation would harm our business and the 
market value of our ADSs and common shares.
We have developed a strategic plan with the goal 
of becoming one of the most admired airlines 
in the world and renewing our commitment to 
sustained profitability and superior returns to shareholders. Our strategy requires us to identify 
value propositions that are attractive to our clients, 
to find efficiencies in our daily operations, and 
to transform ourselves into a stronger and more 
risk-resilient company. A tenet of our strategic 
plan is the continuing adoption of a new travel 
model for domestic and international services to 
address the changing dynamics of customers and 
the industry, and to increase our competitiveness. 
The new travel model is based on a continued 
reduction in air fares that makes air travel 
accessible to a wider audience, and in particular 
to those wish to fly more frequently. This model 
requires continued cost reduction efforts and 
increasing revenues from ancillary activities. 
In connection with these efforts, the Company 
continues to implement a series of initiatives to 
reduce cost per ASK in all its operations as well 
as developing new ancillary revenue initiatives.
Difficulties in implementing our strategy 
may adversely affect our business, results 
of operation and the market value of 
our ADSs and common shares.
Our financial results are exposed to 
foreign currency fluctuations.
We prepare and present our consolidated financial 
statements in U.S. dollars. LATAM and its affiliates 
operate in numerous countries and face the risk of 
variation in foreign currency exchange rates against 
the U.S. dollar or between the currencies of these 
various countries. Changes in the exchange rate 
between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the countries in which we operate could adversely af -
fect our business, financial condition and results of 
operations. If the value of the Brazilian real, Chil -
ean peso or other currencies in which revenues are 
denominated declines against the U.S. dollar, our 
results of operations and financial condition will be 
affected. The exchange rate of the Chilean peso, 
Brazilian real and other currencies against the U.S. 
dollar may fluctuate significantly in the future. 
Changes in Chilean, Brazilian and other govern -
mental economic policies affecting foreign ex -
change rates could also adversely affect our busi -
ness, financial condition, results of operations and 
the return to our shareholders on their common 
shares or ADSs.
We depend on strategic alliances or commercial 
relationships in many of the countries in 
which we operate, and our business may 
suffer if any of our strategic alliances or 
commercial relationships terminates. 
We maintain a number of alliances and other com -
mercial relationships in many of the jurisdictions 
in which LATAM and its affiliates operate. These 
alliances or commercial relationships allow us to 
enhance our network and, in some cases, to offer 
our customers services that we could not other -
wise offer. If any of our strategic alliances or com -
mercial relationships deteriorates, or any of these 
agreements are terminated, our business, financial 
condition and results of operations could be ad -
versely affected. Our business and results of operations may suffer 
if we fail to obtain and maintain routes, suitable 
airport access, slots and other operating permits. 
Also, technical and operational problems with the 
airport infrastructure of cities in which we have a 
focus may have a material adverse effect on us. 
Our business depends upon our access to key 
routes and airports. Bilateral aviation agreements 
between countries, open skies laws and local avia -
tion approvals frequently involve political and other 
considerations outside of our control. Our opera -
tions could be constrained by any delay or inability 
to gain access to key routes or airports, including: 
• limitations on our ability to process more passengers;  
• the imposition of flight capacity restrictions; 
• the inability to secure or maintain route rights in 
local markets or under bilateral agreements; or 
• the inability to maintain our existing slots and ob -
tain additional slots. 
We operate numerous international routes subject 
to bilateral agreements, as well as domestic flights 
within Chile, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and 
Colombia, subject to local route and airport access 
approvals. See “Item 4. Information on the Compa -
ny—B. Business Overview—Regulation. ” 
There can be no assurance that existing bilateral 
agreements with the countries in which our com -
panies are based and permits from foreign govern -
ments will continue. A modification, suspension

or revocation of one or more bilateral agreements 
could have a material adverse effect on our busi-
ness, financial condition and results of opera-
tions. The suspension of our permission to op-
erate in certain airports, destinations or slots, or 
the imposition of other sanctions could also have 
a material adverse effect. A change in the admin-
istration of current laws and regulations or the 
adoption of new laws and regulations in any of 
the countries in which we operate that restrict our 
route, airport or other access may have a material 
adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
Moreover, our operations and growth strategy are 
dependent on the facilities and infrastructure of 
key airports, including Santiago’s International Air -
port, São Paulo’s Guarulhos International and Con -
gonhas Airports, Brasilia’s International Airport and 
Lima’s Jorge Chavez International Airport. 
Santiago’s Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez Inter -
national Airport is currently facing an important 
expansion, which is expected to be completed by 
2021.  If the expansion continues to be delayed, this will likely impact our operations and may af -
fect our ability to remain competitive.
One of the major operational risks we face on a 
daily basis at Lima’s Jorge Chavez International 
Airport is the limited number of parking positions. 
Additionally, the indoor infrastructure of the airport 
limits our ability to manage connections and launch 
new flights due to the lack of gates and increas-
ing security and immigration controls. Lima’s Jorge 
Chavez International Airport is currently undergoing 
an expansion, which is expected to be completed 
by 2024. Any delays could negatively impact our 
operations limit our ability to grow and affect our 
competitiveness in the country and in the region.
Brazilian airports, such as the Brasilia, and São 
Paulo (Guarulhos) International Airports, have lim -
ited the number of takeoff and landing slots per 
day due to infrastructural limitations. Any condi -
tion that would prevent or delay our access to air -
ports or routes that are vital to our strategy, or our 
inability to maintain our existing slots and obtain 
additional slots, could materially adversely affect 
our operations.
A significant portion of our cargo revenue comes from 
relatively few product types and may be impacted by 
events affecting their production, trade or demand.  
Our cargo demand, especially from Latin Amer -
ican exporters, is concentrated in a small num -
ber of product categories, such as exports of fish, sea products and fruits from Chile, asparagus from 
Peru and fresh flowers from Ecuador and Colom -
bia. Events that adversely affect the production, 
trade or demand for these goods may adverse -
ly affect the volume of goods that we transport 
and may have a significant impact on our results 
of operations. Future trade protection measures 
by or against the countries for which we provide 
cargo services may have an impact in cargo traffic 
volumes and adversely affect our financial results. 
Some of our cargo products are sensitive to foreign 
exchange rates and, therefore, traffic volumes could 
be impacted by the appreciation or depreciation of 
local currencies. 
Our operations are subject to fluctuations 
in the supply and cost of jet fuel, which 
could adversely impact our business.  
Higher jet fuel prices could have a materially ad -
verse effect on our business, financial condition and 
results of operations. Jet fuel costs have histori -
cally accounted for a significant amount of our op -
erating expenses, and accounted for 30.2% of our 
operating expenses in 2019. For additional informa -
tion, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. 
Business Overview—Fuel Supplies” . Both the cost 
and availability of fuel are subject to many eco -
nomic and political factors and events that we can 
neither control nor predict, including international 
political and economic circumstances such as the 
political instability in major oil-exporting countries. 
Any future fuel supply shortage (for example, as a result of production curtailments by the Orga -
nization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or 
“OPEC”), a disruption of oil imports, supply dis -
ruptions resulting from severe weather or natural 
disasters, labor actions such as the 2018 trucking 
strike in Brazil, the continued unrest in the Mid -
dle East or other events could result in higher fuel 
prices or reductions in scheduled airline services. 
We cannot ensure that we would be able to offset 
any increases in the price of fuel by increasing our 
fares. In addition, lower fuel prices may result in 
lower fares through the reduction or elimination of 
fuel surcharges. We have entered into fuel hedging 
arrangements, but there can be no assurance that 
such arrangements will be adequate to protect us 
from an increase in fuel prices in the near future 
or in the long term. Also, while these hedging ar -
rangements are designed to limit the effect of an 
increase in fuel prices, our hedging methods may 
also limit our ability to take advantage of any de -
crease in fuel prices, as was the case in 2015 and, 
to a lesser extent, in 2016. See “Item 11. Quanti -
tative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market 
Risk—Risk of Variation in Fuel Prices. ” 
We rely on maintaining a high aircraft 
utilization rate to increase our revenues 
and absorb our fixed costs, which makes 
us especially vulnerable to delays. 
A key element of our strategy is to maintain a high 
daily aircraft utilization rate, which measures the 
number of hours we use our aircraft per day. High

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  Creditsour buSINESSdaily aircraft utilization allows us to maximize the 
amount of revenue we generate from our aircraft 
and absorb the fixed costs associated with our 
fleet and is achieved, in part, by reducing turn-
around times at airports and developing schedules 
that enable us to increase the average hours flown 
per day. Our rate of aircraft utilization could be ad-
versely affected by a number of different factors 
that are beyond our control, including air traffic and 
airport congestion, adverse weather conditions, un-
anticipated maintenance and delays by third-party 
service providers relating to matters such as fuel-
ing and ground handling. If an aircraft falls behind 
schedule, the resulting delays could cause a disrup-
tion in our operating performance and have a finan-
cial impact on our results.
We fly and depend upon Airbus and Boeing aircraft, 
and our business could suffer if we do not receive 
timely deliveries of aircraft, if aircraft from these com -
panies become unavailable or if the public negatively 
perceives our aircraft. 
As our fleet has grown, our reliance on Airbus and 
Boeing has also grown. As of December 31, 2019, Risk managementLATAM Airlines Group has a total fleet of 263 Air -
bus and 79 Boeing aircraft. Risks relating to Airbus 
and Boeing include: 
• our failure or inability to obtain Airbus or Boeing 
aircraft, parts or related support services on a timely 
basis because of high demand, aircraft delivery back-
log or other factors; 
• the interruption of fleet service as a result of un-
scheduled or unanticipated maintenance requirements 
for these aircraft; 
• the issuance by the Chilean or other aviation author -
ities of directives restricting or prohibiting the use of 
our Airbus or Boeing aircraft, or requiring time-con-
suming inspections and maintenance; 
• adverse public perception of a manufacturer as a 
result of safety concerns, negative publicity or other 
problems, whether real or perceived, in the event of 
an accident; or 
• delays between the time we realize the need for new 
aircraft and the time it takes us to arrange for Airbus 
and Boeing or for a third-party provider to deliver this 
aircraft. 
The occurrence of any one or more of these factors 
could restrict our ability to use aircraft to gener -
ate profits, respond to increased demands, or could 
otherwise limit our operations and adversely affect 
our business.If we are unable to incorporate leased aircraft into 
our fleet at acceptable rates and terms in the future, 
our business could be adversely affected.  
 
A large portion of our aircraft fleet is subject to 
long-term leases. Our leases typically run from 
three to 12 years from the date of execution. 
We may face more competition for, or a limited 
supply of, leased aircraft, making it difficult 
for us to negotiate on competitive terms upon 
expiration of our current leases or to lease 
additional capacity required for our targeted 
level of operations. If we are forced to pay 
higher lease rates in the future to maintain our 
capacity and the number of aircraft in our fleet, 
our profitability could be adversely affected. 
Our business may be adversely affected if we are un-
able to service our debt or meet our future financing 
requirements. 
We have a high degree of debt and payment obli-
gations under our aircraft leases and financial debt 
arrangements. We require significant amounts of 
financing to meet our aircraft capital requirements 
and may require additional financing to fund our 
other business needs. We cannot guarantee that 
we will have access to or be able to arrange for fi-
nancing in the future on favorable terms. Higher 
financing costs could affect our ability to expand or 
renew our fleet, which in turn could adversely affect 
our business. In addition, the majority of our property and equip-
ment is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. 
In the event that we fail to make payments on se-
cured indebtedness, creditors’ enforcement of liens 
could limit or end our ability to use the affected 
property and equipment to fulfill our operational 
needs and thus generate revenue.
Moreover, external conditions in the financial and 
credit markets may limit the availability of funding 
at particular times or increase its costs, which could 
adversely affect our profitability, our competitive 
position and result in lower net interest margins, 
earnings and cash flows, as well as lower returns on 
shareholders’ equity and invested capital. Factors 
that may affect the availability of funding or cause 
an increase in our funding costs include global mac -
ro-economic crises, reductions in our credit rat -
ing or in that of our issuances, and other potential 
market disruptions.
We have significant exposure to LIBOR and 
other floating interest rates; increases in 
interest rates will increase our financing costs 
and may have adverse effects on our financial 
condition and results of operations. 
We are exposed to the risk of interest rate varia -
tions, principally in relation to the U.S. dollar Lon -
don Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”). Many of our 
financial leases are denominated in U.S. dollars 
and bear interest at a floating rate. 38.4% of our 
outstanding consolidated debt as of December 31,

2019 bears interest at a floating rate (after giv -
ing effect to interest rate hedging agreements). 
Volatility in LIBOR or other reference rates could 
increase our periodic interest and lease payments 
and have an adverse effect on our total financ -
ing costs. We may be unable to adequately adjust 
our prices to offset any increased financing costs, 
which would have an adverse effect on our results 
of operations. 
On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority 
(the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced 
that it intends to stop compelling banks to sub -
mit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. 
It is unclear whether new methods of calculating 
LIBOR will be established such that it continues 
to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in 
conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates 
Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LI -
BOR with a newly created index, calculated based 
on repurchase agreements backed by treasury 
securities. The impact of such a transition away 
from LIBOR could be significant for us because of 
our substantial indebtedness. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms 
or the establishment of alternative reference 
rates in the United Kingdom, the United States 
or elsewhere. See also the discussion of interest 
rate risk in “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative 
Disclosures About Market Risk—“Risk of Fluctua -
tions in Interest Rates. ”
Increases in insurance costs and/or significant reduc -
tions in coverage could harm our financial condition 
and results of operations. 
Major events affecting the aviation insurance in -
dustry (such as terrorist attacks, hijackings or air -
line crashes) may result in significant increases of 
airlines’ insurance premiums or in significant de -
creases of insurance coverage, as occurred after 
the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Further 
increases in insurance costs or reductions in avail -
able insurance coverage could have an adverse 
impact on our financial results and results of op -
erations and increase the risk that we experience 
uncovered losses.
Problems with air traffic control systems or other 
technical failures could interrupt our operations and 
have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our operations, including our ability to deliver 
customer service, are dependent on the effective 
operation of our equipment, including our aircraft, 
maintenance systems and reservation systems. 
Our operations are also dependent on the effec -tive operation of domestic and international air 
traffic control systems and the air traffic control 
infrastructure by the corresponding authorities 
in the markets in which we operate. Equipment 
failures, personnel shortages, air traffic control 
problems and other factors that could interrupt 
operations could adversely affect our operations 
and financial results as well as our reputation.  
We depend on a limited number of suppliers 
for certain aircraft and engine parts.  
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for 
aircraft, aircraft engines and many aircraft and 
engine parts. As a result, we are vulnerable to 
problems associated with the supply of those air -
craft, parts and engines, including design defects, 
mechanical problems, contractual performance by 
the suppliers, or adverse perception by the pub -
lic that would result in unscheduled maintenance 
requirements, in customer avoidance or in actions 
by the aviation authorities resulting in an inabil -
ity to operate our aircraft. During the year 2019, 
LATAM Airline’s main suppliers were aircraft man -
ufacturers Airbus and Boeing.
In addition to Airbus and Boeing, LATAM Airlines has 
a number of other suppliers, primarily related to 
aircraft accessories, spare parts, and components, 
including Pratt & Whitney, MTU Maintenance, Rolls-
Royce, and Pratt and Whitney Canada.During 2019, Airbus experienced delays in the 
delivery of A320neo aircraft worldwide. LATAM 
is currently expecting delivery of three A320neo 
family aircraft during 2020, but any delivery de -
lays could adversely affect operations.
Rolls-Royce continues to face delays with its 
Trent 1000 engine program, used to power 
LATAM’s Boeing 787 fleet, with increased demand 
for inspections and maintenance. This has affect -
ed the availability and the operational flexibility 
of this aircraft for operators worldwide, with the 
impact for LATAM reaching its peak in July 2018. 
LATAM currently has three aircraft on ground 
awaiting for engines. While the situation has im -
proved considerably, there is no guarantee that 
this will not continue and therefore reduce the 
availability of Boeing 787 aircraft, thus negatively 
affecting operations and financial results.
 Our business relies extensively on third-party ser -
vice providers. Failure of these parties to perform as 
expected, or interruptions in our relationships with 
these providers or in their provision of services to us, 
could have an adverse effect on our financial position 
and results of operations. 
We have engaged a significant number of 
third-party service providers to perform a 
large number of functions that are integral to 
our business, including regional operations, 
operation of customer service call centers, 
distribution and sale of airline seat inventory,

provision of  technology infrastructure and 
services, performance of business processes, 
including purchasing and cash management, 
provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs, 
catering, ground services, and provision of 
various utilities and performance of aircraft 
fueling operations, among other vital functions 
and services. We do not directly control these 
third-party service providers, although we do 
enter into agreements with many of them that 
define expected service performance. Any of 
these third-party service providers, however, may 
materially fail to meet their service performance 
commitments, may suffer disruptions to their 
systems that could impact their services, or 
the agreements with such providers may be 
terminated. For example, flight reservations 
booked by customers and/or travel agencies via 
third-party GDSs (Global Distribution Systems) 
may be adversely affected by disruptions in 
our business relationships with GDS operators 
or by issues in the GDS’s operations. Such 
disruptions, including a failure to agree upon 
acceptable contract terms when contracts expire 
or otherwise become subject to renegotiation, may cause the carriers’ flight information to be 
limited or unavailable for display, significantly 
increase fees for both us and GDS users, and 
impair our relationships with customers and 
travel agencies. The failure of any of our third-
party service providers to adequately perform 
their service obligations, or other interruptions of 
services, may reduce our revenues and increase 
our expenses or prevent us from operating 
our flights and providing other services to our 
customers. In addition, our business, financial 
performance and reputation could be materially 
harmed if our customers believe that our 
services are unreliable or unsatisfactory.
 
Disruptions or security breaches of our 
information technology infrastructure or 
systems could interfere with our operations, 
compromise passenger or employee information, 
and expose us to liability, possibly causing 
our business and reputation to suffer.
A serious internal technology error, failure, or 
cybersecurity incident impacting systems host -
ed internally at our data centers, externally at 
third-party locations or cloud providers, or large-
scale interruption in technology infrastructure we 
depend on, such as power, telecommunications 
or the internet, may disrupt our technology net -
work with potential impact on our operations. Our 
technology systems and related data may also be 
vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, tele -
communications failures, computer viruses, cyber 
attacks and other security issues. These sys -
tems include our computerized airline reservation 
system, flight operations system, telecommu -
nications systems, website, customer, self-ser -
vice applications (“apps”), maintenance systems, 
check-in kiosks, in-flight entertainment systems 
and data centers.
In addition, as a part of our ordinary business 
operations, we collect and store sensitive data, 
including personal information of our passengers 
and employees and information of our business 
partners. The secure operation of the networks 
and systems on which this type of information is 
stored, processed and maintained is critical to our 
business operations and strategy. Unauthorized 
parties may attempt to gain access to our sys -
tems or information through fraud, deception, or 
cybersecurity incident. Hardware or software we 
develop or acquire may contain defects that could 
unexpectedly compromise information security. 
The compromise of our technology systems re -
sulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, 
or access to, customers’ , employees’ or business 
partners’ information could result in legal claims 
or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties un -
der laws protecting the privacy of personal infor -
mation, disruption to our operations and damage 
to our reputation, any or all of which could ad -
versely affect our business.Increases in our labor costs, which constitute 
a substantial portion of our total operating 
expenses, could directly impact our earnings. 
Labor costs constitute a significant percentage of 
our total operating expenses (18.5% in 2019) and at 
times in our operating history we have experienced 
pressure to increase wages and benefits for our 
employees. A significant increase in our labor costs 
could result in a material reduction in our earnings. 
Collective action by employees could cause operating 
disruptions and adversely impact our business. 
Certain employee groups such as pilots, flight 
attendants, mechanics and our airport personnel 
have highly specialized skills. As a consequence, 
actions by these groups, such as strikes, walk-
outs or stoppages, could severely disrupt our op -
erations and adversely impact our operating and 
financial performance, as well as our image.
A strike, work interruption or stoppage or any 
prolonged dispute with our employees who are 
represented by any of these unions could have an 
adverse impact on our operations. These risks are 
typically exacerbated during periods of renegoti -
ation with the unions, which typically occurs every 
two to four years depending on the jurisdiction 
and the union. Any renegotiated collective bar -
gaining agreement could feature significant wage 
increases and a consequent increase in our oper -
ating expenses. Any failure to reach an agreement

during negotiations with unions may require us 
to enter into arbitration proceedings, use finan -
cial and management resources, and potentially 
agree to terms that are less favorable to us than 
our existing agreements. Employees who are not 
currently members of unions may also form new 
unions that may seek further wage increases or 
benefits. 
Our business may experience adverse 
consequences if we are unable to reach 
satisfactory collective bargaining agreements 
with our unionized employees. 
As of December 31, 2019, approximately 46% 
of our employees, including administrative per -
sonnel, cabin crew, flight attendants, pilots and 
maintenance technicians are members of unions 
and have contracts and collective bargaining 
agreements which expire on a regular basis. Our 
business, financial condition and results of oper -
ations could be materially adversely affected by 
a failure to reach agreement with any labor union 
representing such employees or by an agreement with a labor union that contains terms that are 
not in line with our expectations or that prevent 
us from competing effectively with other airlines.
We may experience difficulty finding, training and re -
taining employees.  
 
Our business is labor intensive. We employ a 
large number of pilots, flight attendants, main -
tenance technicians and other operating and ad -
ministrative personnel. The airline industry has, 
from time to time, experienced a shortage of 
qualified personnel, especially pilots and mainte -
nance technicians. In addition, as is common with 
most of our competitors, we may, from time to 
time, face considerable turnover of our employ -
ees. Should the turnover of employees, particu -
larly pilots and maintenance technicians, sharply 
increase, our training costs will be significantly 
higher. We cannot assure you that we will be able 
to recruit, train and retain the managers, pilots, 
technicians and other qualified employees that 
we need to continue our current operations or re -
place departing employees. An increase in turn -
over or failure to recruit, train and retain qualified 
employees at a reasonable cost could materially 
adversely affect our business, financial condition, 
and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY 
AND THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE
Our performance is heavily dependent on economic 
conditions in the countries in which we do business. 
Negative economic conditions in those countries 
could adversely impact our business and results 
of operations and cause the market price of 
our common shares and ADSs to decrease.
Passenger and cargo demand is heavily cyclical 
and highly dependent on global and local economic 
growth, economic expectations and foreign exchange 
rate variations, among other things. In the past, 
our business has been adversely affected by glob -
al economic recessionary conditions, weak economic 
growth in Chile, recession in Brazil and Argentina and 
poor economic performance in certain emerging mar -
ket countries in which we operate. The occurrence of 
similar events in the future could adversely affect our 
business. We plan to continue to expand our oper -
ations based in Latin America and our performance 
will, therefore, continue to depend heavily on eco -
nomic conditions in the region. 
Any of the following factors could adversely affect 
our business, financial condition and results of op -
erations in the countries in which we operate: • changes in economic or other governmental policies; 
• changes in regulatory, legal or administrative practices;
• weak economic performance, including, but not 
limited to, a slowdown in the Brazilian economy, 
political instability low economic growth, low con -
sumption and/or investment rates, and increased 
inflation rates; or 
• other political or economic developments over 
which we have no control.  
No assurance can be given that capacity reduc -
tions or other steps we may take in response to 
weakened demand will be adequate to offset any 
future reduction in our cargo and/or air travel de -
mand in markets in which we operate. Sustained 
weak demand may adversely impact our reve -
nues, results of operations or financial condition.
An adverse economic environment, whether glob -
al, regional or in a particular country, could result 
in a reduction in passenger traffic, as well as a re -
duction in our cargo business, and could also im -
pact our ability to raise fares, which in turn would 
materially and negatively affect our financial con -
dition and results of operations.
We are exposed to increases in landing fees and 
other airport service charges that could adversely 
affect our margin and competitive position. Also, 
151

it cannot be assured that in the future we will 
have access to adequate facilities and landing 
rights necessary to achieve our expansion plans.
We must pay fees to airport operators for the use 
of their facilities. Any substantial increase in airport 
charges, including at Guarulhos International Airport 
in São Paulo, Jorge Chavez International Airport in 
Lima or Comodoro Arturo Merino Benitez Internation -
al Airport in Santiago, could have a material adverse 
impact on our results of operations. Passenger taxes 
and airport charges have increased substantially in 
recent years. We cannot assure you that the airports 
in which we operate will not increase or maintain high 
passenger taxes and service charges in the future. 
Any such increases could have an adverse effect on 
our financial condition and results of operations.
Certain airports that we serve (or that we plan to 
serve in the future) are subject to capacity con -
straints and impose various restrictions, including 
takeoff and landing slot restrictions during certain 
periods of the day and limits on aircraft noise levels. 
We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain 
a sufficient number of slots, gates and other facil -ities at airports to expand our services in line with 
our growth strategy. It is also possible that airports 
not currently subject to capacity constraints may 
become so in the future. In addition, an airline must 
use its slots on a regular and timely basis or risk 
having those slots re-allocated to others. Where 
slots or other airport resources are not available or 
their availability is restricted in some way, we may 
have to amend our schedules, change routes or re -
duce aircraft utilization. It is also possible that avia -
tion authorities in the countries in which we oper -
ate, change the rules for the assignment of takeoff 
and landing slots, as it was the case with the São 
Paulo airport (Congonhas) in 2019 where the slots 
previously operated by Avianca Brazil were reas -
signed. Any of these alternatives could have an ad -
verse financial impact on our operations. We cannot 
ensure that airports at which there are no such re -
strictions may not implement restrictions in the fu -
ture or that, where such restrictions exist, they may 
not become more onerous. Such restrictions may 
limit our ability to continue to provide or to increase 
services at such airports.
Our business is highly regulated and changes 
in the regulatory environment in the countries 
in which we operate may adversely affect 
our business and results of operations. 
Our business is highly regulated and depends 
substantially upon the regulatory environment 
in the countries in which we operate or intend to 
operate. For example, price controls on fares may limit our ability to effectively apply customer seg -
mentation profit maximization techniques (“pas -
senger revenue management”) and adjust prices 
to reflect cost pressures. High levels of govern -
ment regulation may limit the scope of our oper -
ations and our growth plans. The possible failure 
of aviation authorities to maintain the required 
governmental authorizations or our failure to 
comply with applicable regulations, may adversely 
affect our business and results of operations.
Our business, financial condition, results of oper -
ations and the price of preferred shares and ADSs 
may be adversely affected by changes in policy or 
regulations at the federal, state or municipal level 
in the countries in which we operate, involving or 
affecting factors such as: 
• interest rates;
• currency fluctuations;
• monetary policies;
• inflation;
• liquidity of capital and lending markets;
• tax and social security policies;
• labor regulations;
• energy and water shortages and rationing; and
• other political, social and economic developments 
in or affecting Brazil, Chile, Peru, and the United 
States, among others.
For example, the Brazilian federal government has 
frequently intervened in the domestic economy 
and made drastic changes in policy and regula -tions to control inflation and affect other policies 
and regulations. This required the federal govern -
ment to increase interest rates, change taxes and 
social security policies, implement price controls, 
currency exchange and remittance controls, de -
valuations, capital controls and limits on imports. 
Uncertainty over whether the Brazilian federal 
government will implement changes in policy or 
regulation affecting these or other factors may 
contribute to economic uncertainty in Brazil and 
to heightened volatility in the Brazilian securities 
markets and securities issued abroad by Brazil -
ian companies. These and other developments in 
the Brazilian economy and governmental policies 
may adversely affect us and our business and re -
sults of operations and may adversely affect the 
trading price of our preferred shares and ADSs.
We are also subject to international bilateral air 
transport agreements that provide for the exchange 
of air traffic rights between the countries where we 
operate, and we must obtain permission from the 
applicable foreign governments to provide service to 
foreign destinations. There can be no assurance that 
such existing bilateral agreements will continue, or 
that we will be able to obtain more route rights un -
der those agreements to accommodate our future 
expansion plans. Certain bilateral agreements also 
include provisions that require substantial ownership 
or effective control. Any modification, suspension 
or revocation of one or more bilateral agreements 
could have a material adverse effect on our busi -

The suspension of our permits to operate to certain 
airports or destinations, the inability for us to obtain 
favorable take-off and landing authorizations at cer -
tain high-density airports or the imposition of other 
sanctions could also have a negative impact on our 
business. We cannot be certain that a change in own -
ership or effective control or in a foreign government’s 
administration of current laws and regulations or the 
adoption of new laws and regulations will not have 
a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 
Losses and liabilities in the event of an accident 
involving one or more of our aircraft could materially 
affect our business.  
 
We are exposed to potential catastrophic 
losses in the event of an aircraft accident, 
terrorist incident or any other similar event. 
There can be no assurance that, as a result of 
an aircraft accident or significant incident: 
• we will not need to increase our insurance coverage; 
• our insurance premiums will not increase significantly; Risk management• our insurance coverage will fully cover all of our 
liability; or 
• we will not be forced to bear substantial losses. 
Substantial claims resulting from an accident or sig -
nificant incident in excess of our related insurance 
coverage could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Moreover, any aircraft accident, even if fully insured, 
could cause the negative public perception that our 
aircraft are less safe or reliable than those operated by 
other airlines, or by other flight operators, which could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, finan -
cial condition and results of operations.
Insurance premiums may also increase due to an 
accident or incident affecting one of our alliance 
partners or other airlines, or due to a perception of 
increased risk in the industry related to concerns 
about war or terrorist attacks, the general industry, 
or general industry safety. 
High levels of competition in the airline 
industry, such as the presence of low-cost 
carriers in the markets in which we operate, 
may adversely affect our level of operations. 
Our business, financial condition and results of 
operations could be adversely affected by high 
levels of competition within the industry, partic -
ularly the entrance of new competitors into the 
markets in which we operate. Airlines compete 
primarily over fare levels, frequency and depend -ability of service, brand recognition, passenger 
amenities (such as frequent flyer programs) and 
the availability and convenience of other pas -
senger or cargo services. New and existing air -
lines (and companies providing ground cargo or 
passenger transportation) could enter our mar -
kets and compete with us on any of these bases, 
including by offering lower prices, more attrac -
tive services or increasing their route offerings in 
an effort to gain greater market share. For more 
information regarding our main competitors, see 
“Item 4. Information of the Company—B. Busi -
ness Overview—Passenger Operations—Inter -
national Passenger Operations” and “Item 4. 
Information of the Company—B. Business Over -
view—Passenger Operations—Business Model 
for Domestic Operations. ”
Low-cost carriers have an important impact in 
the industry’s revenues given their low unit costs. 
Lower costs allow low-cost carriers to offer inex -
pensive fares which, in turn, allow price sensitive 
customers to fly or to shift from large to low cost 
carriers. In past years we have seen more inter -
est in the development of the low-cost mod -
el throughout Latin America. For example, in the 
Chilean market, Sky Airline, our main competi -
tor, has been migrating to a low-cost model since 
2015, while in July 2017, JetSmart, a new low-cost 
airline, started operations. In the Peruvian domes -
tic market, VivaAir Peru, a new low-cost airline, 
started operations in May 2017, and in April 2019, 
another low-cost airline, Sky Airline Peru, start -ed operations. In Colombia, low-cost competitor 
VivaColombia has been operating in the domes -
tic market since May 2012. Low-cost competi -
tors Flybondi and Norwegian began operations in 
the Argentinian domestic market during 2018, and 
in April 2019, JetSmart, another low-cost airline, 
started operations and announced the acquisition 
of Norwegian´s Argetinian subsidiary operations 
in December 2019. A number of low-cost carriers 
have announced growth strategies including com -
mitments to acquire significant numbers of air -
craft for delivery in the next few years. The entry 
of the low-cost carriers local into markets in which 
we compete, including those described above, 
could have a material adverse effect on our opera -
tions and financial performance.
Our international strategic growth plans rely, in part, 
upon receipt of regulatory approvals of the coun -
tries in which we plan to expand our operations with 
a Joint Business Agreement (JBA). We may not be 
able to obtain those approvals, while other com -
petitors might be approved. Accordingly, we might 
not be able to compete for the same routes as our 
competitors, which could diminish our market share 
and adversely impact our financial results. No as -
surances can be given as to any benefits, if any, 
that we may derive from such agreements.

Some of our competitors may receive 
external support, which could adversely 
impact our competitive position. 
Some of our competitors may receive support 
from external sources, such as their national gov -
ernments, which may be unavailable to us. Sup -
port may include, among others, subsidies, finan -
cial aid or tax waivers. This support could place 
us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely 
affect our operations and financial performance. 
For example, Aerolineas Argentinas has historical -
ly been government subsidized.
Moreover, as a result of the competitive environ -
ment, there may be further consolidation in the 
Latin American and global airline industry, wheth -
er by means of acquisitions, joint ventures, part -
nerships or strategic alliances. We cannot predict 
the effects of further consolidation on the indus -
try. Furthermore, consolidation in the airline in -
dustry and changes in international alliances will 
continue to affect the competitive landscape in 
the industry and may result in the development of airlines and alliances with increased financial 
resources, more extensive global networks and re -
duced cost structures.  
Some of the countries where we operate may not 
comply with international agreements previously 
established, which could increase the risk perception 
of doing business in that specific market and as a 
consequence impact our business and financial results. 
Rulings by a bankruptcy court in Brazil and by higher 
judicial authorities related to the bankruptcy pro -
ceedings of Avianca Brazil may appear to be incon -
sistent with the Cape Town Convention (CTC) treaty 
that Brazil has signed, thus raising concerns about the 
rights of creditors in respect of financings secured 
by aircraft. Accordingly, if creditors perceive that 
an increase business risk is created by these rulings 
for leasing or other financing transactions involv -
ing aircraft in Brazil, there is a possibility that rating 
agencies may issue lower credit ratings in respect of 
financings that are secured by aircraft in Brazil.  As a 
result, our business and financial results may be ad -
versely affected if our financing activities in Brazil are 
impacted by such events.
Our operations are subject to local, national and 
international environmental regulations; costs 
of compliance with applicable regulations, or the 
consequences of noncompliance, could adversely 
affect our results, our business or our reputation.
Our operations are affected by environmental reg -ulations at local, national and international levels. 
These regulations cover, among other things, emis -
sions to the atmosphere, disposal of solid waste 
and aqueous effluents, aircraft noise and other ac -
tivities incident to our business. Future operations 
and financial results may vary as a result of such 
regulations. Compliance with these regulations and 
new or existing regulations that may be applica -
ble to us in the future could increase our cost base 
and adversely affect our operations and financial 
results. In addition, failure to comply with these 
regulations could adversely affect us in a variety of 
ways, including adverse effects on our reputation.
In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(“ICAO”) adopted a resolution creating the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for Internation -
al Aviation (CORSIA), providing a framework for a 
global market-based measure to stabilize carbon 
dioxide (“CO2”) emissions in international civil avi -
ation (i.e., civil aviation flights that depart in one 
country and arrive in a different country). CORSIA 
will be implemented in phases, starting with the 
participation of ICAO member states on a volun -
tary basis during a pilot phase (from 2021 through 
2023), followed by a first phase (from 2024 through 
2026) and a second phase (from 2027). Currently, 
CORSIA focuses on defining standards for monitor -
ing, reporting and verification of emissions from air 
operators, as well as on defining steps to offset CO2 
emissions after 2020. To the extent most of the 
countries in which we operate continue to be ICAO 
member states, in the future we may be affect -ed by regulations adopted pursuant to the CORSIA 
framework.
The proliferation of national regulations and taxes on 
CO2 emissions in the countries that we have domestic 
operations, including environmental regulations that 
the airline industry is facing in Colombia, may also af -
fect our costs of operations and our margins.
Our business may be adversely affected by 
a downturn in the airline industry caused 
by exogenous events that affect travel 
behavior or increase costs, such as outbreak 
of disease, weather conditions and natural 
disasters, war or terrorist attacks.
Demand for air transportation may be adversely 
impacted by exogenous events, such as adverse 
weather conditions and natural disasters, epi -
demics (such as Ebola and Zika) and outbreaks 
such as the recent coronavirus, terrorist attacks, 
war or political and social instability. Situations 
such as these in one or more of the markets in 
which we operate could have a material impact 
on our business, financial condition and results 
of operations. Furthermore, the current spread 
of the coronavirus and other adverse public 
health developments could have a prolonged ef -
fect on air transportation demand and any pro -
longed or widespread effects could significantly 
impact our operations.

After the terrorist attacks in the United States on 
September 11, 2001, the Company made the de -
cision to reduce its flights to the United States. In 
connection with the reduction in service, the Com -
pany reduced its workforce resulting in additional 
expenses due to severance payments to terminat -
ed employees during 2001. Any future terrorist at -
tacks or threat of attacks, whether or not involving 
commercial aircraft, any increase in hostilities re -
lating to reprisals against terrorist organizations or 
otherwise and any related economic impact could 
result in decreased passenger traffic and materi -
ally and negatively affect our business, financial 
condition and results of operations.
After the 2001 terrorist attacks, airlines have ex -
perienced increased costs resulting from addi -
tional security measures that may be made even 
more rigorous in the future. In addition to mea -
sures imposed by the U.S. Department of Home -
land Security and the TSA, IATA and certain for -
eign governments have also begun to institute 
additional security measures at foreign airports 
we serve.Revenues for airlines depend on the number of 
passengers carried, the fare paid by each pas -
senger and service factors, such as the timeliness 
of flight departures and arrivals. During periods 
of fog, ice, low temperatures, storms or other 
adverse weather conditions, some or all of our 
flights may be cancelled or significantly delayed, 
reducing our profitability. In addition, fuel prices 
and supplies, which constitute a significant cost 
for us, may increase as a result of any future ter -
rorist attacks, a general increase in hostilities or 
a reduction in output of fuel, voluntary or other -
wise, by oil-producing countries. Such increases 
may result in both higher airline ticket prices and 
decreased demand for air travel generally, which 
could have an adverse effect on our revenues and 
results of operations. 
A pandemic or the widespread outbreak of 
contagious illnesses can have a material adverse 
effect on our business and results of operations.
The widespread outbreak of a contagious ill -
ness such as the novel COVID-19 (Coronavirus), 
first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China 
and which has been declared a pandemic by the 
World Health Organization (WHO), or fear of such 
an event, is materially reducing demand for, and 
availability of, worldwide air travel and therefore is 
having a material adverse effect on our business 
and results of operations.In 2003, an outbreak of a coronavirus known as se -
vere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originating in 
China became an epidemic and resulted in a slow -
down of passenger air traffic due contagion fears. At 
the time, RPK growth was reduced due to oversupply 
in the market as airlines tried to cut capacity.
The recent outbreak of Coronavirus has negatively 
affected global economic conditions, disrupted sup -
ply chains and otherwise negatively impacted air -
craft manufacturing operations and may reduce the 
availability of aircraft and aircraft spare parts. The 
ultimate severity of the Coronavirus outbreak is un -
certain at this time and therefore we cannot predict 
the impact it may have on the availability of aircraft 
or aircraft spare parts. However, the effect on our 
results may be material and adverse if supply chain 
disruptions persist and preclude our ability to ade -
quately maintain our fleet.
The recent outbreak of Coronavirus has also led 
to government-imposed travel restrictions, flight 
cancellations, and a marked decline in passenger 
demand for air travel. Accordingly, LATAM Airlines 
Group and its affiliates implemented a reduction in 
international flights of approximately 30% and re -
cently updated the decrease in capacity to approx -
imately 70% of the total operations, corresponding 
90% to international operations and 40% to domes -
tic operations. These measures will apply principally 
to flights from South America to Europe and the US 
between April 1 and May 30, 2020. The potential for a period of significantly reduced demand for travel 
has and will likely continue to result in significant 
lost revenue. As a result of these or other condi -
tions beyond our control, our results of operations 
could be volatile and subject to rapid and unex -
pected change. In addition, if the spread of the 
Coronavirus were to continue unabated, our oper -
ations could also be negatively affected if em -
ployees are quarantined as the result of exposure 
to the contagious illness. We cannot currently fully 
predict the impact that the Coronavirus outbreak 
will have on global air travel and the extent to 
which it may impact the demand for air travel in 
the regions we operate. Continued travel restric -
tions or operational issues resulting from the rapid 
spread of the Coronavirus or other contagious ill -
nesses that adversely reduce demand for air travel 
in a part of the world in which we have significant 
operations could a material adverse effect on our 
business and results of operations.
We are subject to risks related to litigation and ad -
ministrative proceedings that could adversely affect 
our business and financial performance in the event 
of an unfavorable ruling.  
 
The nature of our business exposes us to lit -
igation relating to labor, insurance and safe -
ty matters, regulatory, tax and administrative 
proceedings, governmental investigations, tort 
claims and contract disputes. Litigation is inher -
ently costly and unpredictable, making it diffi -
cult to accurately estimate the outcome among

We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-
money laundering and antitrust laws and regulations in 
Chile, the United States and in the various countries we 
operate. Violations of any such laws or regulations could 
have a material adverse impact on our reputation and

We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, 
anti-money laundering, antitrust and other 
international laws and regulations and are 
required to comply with the applicable laws 
and regulations of all jurisdictions where we operate. In addition, we are subject to economic 
sanctions regulations that restrict our dealings 
with certain sanctioned countries, individuals 
and entities. There can be no assurance that 
our internal policies and procedures will be 
sufficient to prevent or detect all inappropriate 
practices, fraud or violations of law by our 
affiliates, employees, directors, officers, partners, 
agents and service providers or that any such 
persons will not take actions in violation of our 
policies and procedures. Any violations by us 
of laws or regulations could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, reputation, 
results of operations and financial condition.   
Latin American governments have exercised 
and continue to exercise significant 
influence over their economies. 
Governments in Latin America frequently intervene in 
the economies of their respective countries and oc -
casionally make significant changes in policy and reg -
ulations. Governmental actions have often involved, 
among other measures, nationalizations and expropri -
ations, price controls, currency devaluations, man -
datory increases on wages and employee benefits, 
capital controls and limits on imports. Our business, 
financial condition and results of operations may be 
adversely affected by changes in government poli -
cies or regulations, including such factors as exchange 
rates and exchange control policies; inflation con -
trol policies; price control policies; consumer protec -
tion policies; import duties and restrictions; liquidity of domestic capital and lending markets; electricity 
rationing; tax policies, including tax increases and 
retroactive tax claims; and other political, diplomat -
ic, social and economic developments in or affecting 
the countries where we operate. 
For example, the Brazilian government’s actions to 
control inflation and implement other policies have 
involved wage and price controls, depreciation of 
the real, controls over remittance of funds abroad, 
intervention by the Central Bank to affect base 
interest rates and other measures. In the future, 
the level of intervention by Latin American govern -
ments may continue or increase. We cannot assure 
you that these or other measures will not have a 
material adverse effect on the economy of each 
respective country and, consequently, will not ad -
versely affect our business, financial condition and 
results of operations.
Political instability and social unrest in Latin 
America may adversely affect our business.
We operate primarily within Latin America and 
are thus subject to a full range of risks associat -
ed with our operations in this region. These risks 
may include unstable political or social condi -
tions, lack of well-established or reliable legal 
systems, exchange controls and other limits on 
our ability to repatriate earnings and changeable 
legal and regulatory requirements.Although political and social conditions in one 
country may differ significantly from another 
country, events in any of our key markets could 
adversely affect our business, financial condi -
tions or results of operations. 
For example, in Brazil, in the last couple of 
years, as a result of the ongoing Operation Car 
Wash (Lava Jato investigation), a number of 
senior politicians have resigned or been arrest -
ed and other senior elected officials and pub -
lic officials are being investigated for allega -
tions of corruption. One of the most significant 
events that elapsed from this operation was the 
impeachment of the former President Rous -
seff by the Brazilian Senate on August, 2016, 
for violations of fiscal responsibility laws and 
the governing of its Vice-President, Michel Te -
mer, during the last two years of the presiden -
tial mandate, which due to the development 
of the investigations conducted by the Feder -
al Police Department and the General Federal 
Prosecutor’s Office indicted President Temer on 
corruption charges. Along with the political and 
economic uncertainty period the country was 
facing, in July 2017, former President Luiz Inácio 
Lula da Silva was convicted of corruption and 
money laundering by a lower federal court in the 
State of Paraná in connection with the Opera -
tion Car Wash (Lava Jato). In addition, Argentine 
presidential elections held in October 2019, saw 
the return of the former president of Argen -
tina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner who was

elected Vice-President and who was previously 
prosecuted for alleged corruption. In 2019, Peru 
experienced a constitutional crisis began when 
President Martín Vizcarra dissolved the Congress 
of Peru on September 30, 2019. The Peruvian 
Congress responded by declaring Vizcarra’s pres -
idency suspended and appointed Vice President 
Mercedes Aráoz as interim president, moves that 
were largely seen as null and void. The Peruvian 
Constitutional Court ruled that President Martín 
Vizcarra had not exceeded his powers when he 
took the step amid a stand-off between the 
government and opposition-controlled Con -
gress. Opposition lawmakers had denounced it 
as a coup but the heads of armed forces and the 
police backed the president. In October 2019. 
Chile saw significant protests associated with 
economic conditions resulting in the declaration 
of a state of emergency in several major cit -
ies. The protests in Chile began over criticisms 
about a lack of quality education, weak pen -
sions, increasing prices and low minimum wage. 
Current initiatives to address the concerns of the 
protesters are under discussion in the Chilean 
Congress. These initiatives include labor reforms, tax reforms and pension reforms, among others. 
It is not possible to predict the effect of these 
changes as they are still under discussion, but 
could potentially result in higher payments of 
wages and salaries and an increase in taxes. On 
April 26, 2020, Chile will hold a referendum on 
whether and how to change the current consti -
tution, which could lead to additional protests. 
If social unrest in Chile were to continue or in -
tensify, it could lead to operational delays or 
adversely impact our ability to operate in Chile. 
LATAM took a series of measures to alleviate the 
impact for its passengers, including refunds and 
changes of tickets. The Company estimated a 
total impact of approximately US$40 million for 
2019.
Although conditions throughout Latin America vary 
from country to country, our customers’ reactions 
to developments in Latin America generally may 
result in a reduction in passenger traffic, which 
could materially and negatively affect our financial 
condition and results of operations.
Latin American countries have experienced periods 
of adverse macroeconomic conditions.  
 
Our business is dependent upon economic 
conditions prevalent in Latin America. 
Latin American countries have historically 
experienced economic instability, including 
uneven periods of economic growth as well as 
significant downturns. High interest, inflation (in some cases substantial and prolonged), and 
unemployment rates generally characterize 
each economy. Because commodities such 
as agricultural products, minerals, and metals 
represent a significant percentage of exports of 
many Latin American countries, the economies 
of those countries are particularly sensitive to 
fluctuations in commodity prices. Investments 
in the region may also be subject to currency 
risks, such as restrictions on the flow of money 
in and out of the country, extreme volatility 
relative to the U.S. dollar, and devaluation.
For example, in the past, Peru has experienced 
periods of severe economic recession, currency 
devaluation, high inflation, and political 
instability, which have led to adverse economic 
consequences. We cannot assure you that 
Peru will not experience similar adverse 
developments in the future even though for 
some years now, several democratic procedures 
have been completed without any violence. 
We cannot assure you that the current or any 
future administration will maintain business-
friendly and open-market economic policies 
or policies that stimulate economic growth 
and social stability. In Brazil, the Brazil Real 
GDP decreased 3.5% in 2015, decreased 
3.3% in 2016, increased 1.1% in 2017 and 
increased 1.1% in 2018, according to the 
Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics 
(Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estadística, 
or “IGBE”). In addition, the credit rating of the Brazilian federal government was downgraded 
in 2015 and 2016 by all major credit rating 
agencies and is no longer investment grade. 
We can offer no assurances as to the policies 
that may be implemented by the recently 
elected Argentine administration, or that 
political developments in Argentina will not 
adversely affect the Argentine economy.
 
Accordingly, any changes in the economies 
of the Latin American countries in which 
LATAM and its affiliates operate or the 
governments’ economic policies may have 
a negative effect on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON 
SHARES AND ADSS 
Our major shareholders may have interests that differ 
from those of our other shareholders.  
 
The major shareholder group, the Cueto Group 
(the “Cueto Group”), beneficially owned 21.46% 
of our common shares as of February 29, 2020. 
In addition, the Cueto Group entered into a 
shareholders’ agreement with the Amaro Group 
(the “Amaro Group”), which as of February 29, 
2020, held 1.98% of LATAM shares through TEP 
Chile, in addition to the indirect stake it has 
through the 21.88% interest it holds in Costa Verde 
Aeronáutica S.A., the main legal vehicle through 
which the Cueto Group holds LATAM shares,

groups have agreed to vote together to elect 
individuals to our board of directors in accordance 
with their direct and indirect shareholder interest in 
LATAM. Pursuant to the shareholders’ agreement, 
the Cueto Group and the Amaro Group have also 
agreed to use their good faith efforts to reach 
an agreement and act jointly on all actions to be 
taken by our board of directors or shareholders’ 
meeting, and if unable to reach to such agreement, 
to follow the proposals made by our board of 
directors. Decisions by the Company that require 
supermajority votes under Chilean law are subject 
to voting arrangements by the Cueto Group and 
the Amaro Group. In addition, other shareholders 
including, Delta Air Lines, Inc, which, as of February 
29, 2020, held 20.00% of our common shares, 
and Qatar Airways Investments (UK) Ltd., which 
as of February 29, 2020, held 10.00%1 of our 
common shares, could have interests that may 
differ from those of our other shareholders. 
See “Item 7 . Major Shareholders and Related 
Party Transactions—A. Major Shareholders. ” 
Under the terms of the deposit agreement Risk managementgoverning the ADSs, if holders of ADSs do 
not provide JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., in 
its capacity as depositary for the ADSs, with 
timely instructions on the voting of the common 
shares underlying their ADRs, the depositary will 
be deemed to have been instructed to give a 
person designated by the board of directors the 
discretionary right to vote those common shares. 
The person designated by the board of directors 
to exercise this discretionary voting right may 
have interests that are aligned with our controlling 
shareholders, which may differ from those of 
our other shareholders. Historically, our board of 
directors has designated its chairman to exercise 
this right; for example, the members of the board 
of directors elected by the shareholders in 2019 
designated Ignacio Cueto, to serve in this role.
 
1 Qatar holds 9.9999998% of LATAM’s total subscribed and 
paid-in shares.
 
Trading of our ADSs and common shares in the 
securities markets is limited and could experience 
further illiquidity and price volatility. 
Our common shares are listed on the various Chil -
ean stock exchanges. Chilean securities markets 
are substantially smaller, less liquid and more vol -
atile than major securities markets in the Unit -
ed States. In addition, Chilean securities markets 
may be materially affected by developments in 
other emerging markets, particularly other coun -
tries in Latin America. Accordingly, although you are entitled to withdraw the common shares 
underlying the ADSs from the depositary at any 
time, your ability to sell the common shares un -
derlying ADSs in the amount and at the price and 
time of your choice may be substantially limited. 
This limited trading market may also increase the 
price volatility of the ADSs or the common shares 
underlying the ADSs.
Holders of ADRs may be adversely affected by 
currency devaluations and foreign exchange 
fluctuations.  
 
If the Chilean peso exchange rate falls relative 
to the U.S. dollar, the value of the ADSs and 
any distributions made thereon from the 
depositary could be adversely affected. Cash 
distributions made in respect of the ADSs are 
received by the depositary (represented by the 
custodian bank in Chile) in pesos, converted 
by the custodian bank into U.S. dollars at the 
then-prevailing exchange rate and distributed 
by the depositary to the holders of the ADRs 
evidencing those ADSs. In addition, the 
depositary will incur foreign currency conversion 
costs (to be borne by the holders of the ADRs) in 
connection with the foreign currency conversion 
and subsequent distribution of dividends or 
other payments with respect to the ADSs. 
Future changes in Chilean foreign investment controls 
and withholding taxes could negatively affect non-
Chilean residents that invest in our shares.  Equity investments in Chile by non-Chilean 
residents have been subject in the past to 
various exchange control regulations that govern 
investment repatriation and earnings thereon. 
Although not currently in effect, regulations 
of the Central Bank of Chile have in the past 
required, and could again require, foreign investors 
acquiring securities in the secondary market in 
Chile to maintain a cash reserve or to pay a fee 
upon conversion of foreign currency to purchase 
such securities. Furthermore, any changes in 
withholding taxes could negatively affect non-
Chilean residents that invest in our shares. 
We cannot assure you that additional Chilean 
restrictions applicable to the holders of 
ADRs, the disposition of the common shares 
underlying ADSs or the repatriation of the 
proceeds from an acquisition, a disposition or 
a dividend payment, will not be imposed or 
required in the future, nor could we make an 
assessment as to the duration or impact, were 
any such restrictions to be imposed or required.
Our ADS holders may not be able to exercise 
preemptive rights in certain circumstances.  
The Chilean Corporation Law provides that pre -
emptive rights shall be granted to all shareholders 
whenever a company issues new shares for cash, 
giving such holders the right to purchase a suffi -
cient number of shares to maintain their existing 
ownership percentage. We will not be able to offer

then make a decision as to whether we will file a

we will decide to file a registration statement or 
that such rights will be available to ADS holders and 
shareholders located in the United States.Risk managementWe are not required to disclose as much 
information to investors as a U.S. issuer is 
required to disclose and, as a result, you may 
receive less information about us than you would 
receive from a comparable U.S. company. 
The corporate disclosure requirements that apply 
to us may not be equivalent to the disclosure

reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. 
The disclosure requirements applicable to foreign 
issuers under the Exchange Act are more limited 
than the disclosure requirements applicable to 
U.S. issuers. Publicly available information about 
issuers of securities listed on Chilean stock 
exchanges also provides less detail in certain 
respects than the information regularly published 
by listed companies in the United States or in 
certain other countries. Furthermore, there is a 
lower level of regulation of the Chilean securities 
market and of the activities of investors in such 
markets as compared with the level of regulation 
of the securities markets in the United States 
and in certain other developed countries.

and subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated st atements of financial position as at December 
31, 2019 and 2018 and as at January 1, 2018 and the consolidated statements of income by function, 
consolidated comprehensive income, consolidated ch anges in equity and consolidated cash flows –
direct method for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the corresponding notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This 
responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of a relevant internal control for 
the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our 
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with Chilean Generally Accepted Auditing Standards. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers 
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. As a 
consequence we do not express that kind of opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and th e reasonableness of accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects the 
financial position of Latam Airlines Group S.A. and subsidiaries as at December 31, 2019 and 2018 
and January, 1, 2018, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 
2019 and 2018 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Emphasis of matter
As described in note 2.1 to the consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 2019, the company 
adopted IFRS 16 - Leases, which establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, 
presentation and disclosure of leases. The Company has chosen to apply this standard retrospectively, 
restating the balances as at January 1 and December 31, 2018. Our opinion is not modified in respect 
of this matter.

- Effects of  adopting  IFRS 9  
 
(1) Expected credit losses: The Company modified the calculation of the impairment provision to 
comply with the expected credit loss model, established in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which 
replaces the current loss impairment model incurred. To the calculate pe rcentage  of credit losses, 
a risk matrix was used, grouping the portfolio, a ccording to similar characteristics of risk and 
maturity. This change resulted in the recognition of an increase in the provision for impairment 
losses of US $ (11.1) million.  
 
This standard also includes requirements related to the classification and meas urement of 
financial assets and liabilities and an expected credit loss model that replaces the current  loss 
impairment model incurred.  
 
     As of January 1, 2018, the calculation of the impairment  losses provision are as follows:

The management of the Company estimates that the adoption of the standar ds, amendments and 
Interpretations described above, will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial 
statements  of the Company in the application  of its first adoption . At the close consolidated 
financial statements,  the Company is analyzing the possible effects of the amendment issued in 
September 2019 to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 for the reform of interest rates of reference.  
2.2. Basis of Consolidation  
 
(a) Subsidiaries  
 
Subsidiaries are all the entities (including special -purpose entities) over which the Company has the 
power to control the financial and operating po licies, which are generally accompanied by a holding 
of more than half of the voting rights. In evaluating whether the Company controls another entity, 12 
 
the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible at the  
date of the consolidated financial statements are considered. The subsidiaries are consolidated from 
the date on which control is passed to the Company and they are excluded from the consolidation 
on the date they cease to be so controlled. The results an d flows are incorporated from the date of 
acquisition.  
 
Balances, transactions  and unrealized  gains on transactions between the Company’s entities are 
eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairme nt loss of the asset transferred. When necessary in order to ensure uniformity with the 
policies adopted by the Company, the accounting policies of the subsidiaries are modified.  
 
To account for and identify the financial information revealed when carrying  out a business 
combination, such as the acquisition of an entity by the Company, is apply the acquisition method 
provided for in IFRS 3: Business combination.  
 
(b) Transactions with non -controlling interests  
 
The Group applies the policy of considering tr ansactions with non -controlling interests, when not 
related to loss of control, as equity transactions without an effect on income.  
 
(c) Sales of subsidiaries  
 
When a subsidiary is sold and a percentage of participation is not retained, the Company 
derecog nizes assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, the non -controlling and other components of 
equity related to the subsidiary. Any gain or loss resulting from the loss of control is recognized in 
the consolidated income statement in Other gains (losses).  
 
If LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries retain an ownership of participation in the sold 
subsidiary, and does not represent control, this is recognized at fair value on the date that control is 
lost, the amounts previously recognized in Other comprehe nsive income are accounted as if the 
Company had disposed directly from the assets and related liabilities, which can cause these 
amounts are reclassified to profit or loss. The percentage retained valued at fair value is 
subsequently accounted using the e quity method.  
 
(d) Investees or associates  
 
Investees or associates are all entities over which LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries 
have significant influence but have no control. This usually arises from holding between 20% and 
50% of the voting ri ghts. Investments in associates are booked using the equity method and are 
initially recognized at their cost.  
 
2.3. Foreign currency transactions  
 
(a) Presentation and functional currencies  
 
The items included in the financial statements of each of the entities of LATAM Airlines Group 
S.A. and Subsidiaries are valued using the currency of the main economic environment in which the 
entity operates (the fu nctional currency). The functional currency of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. 
is the United States dollar which is also the presentation currency of the consolidated financial 
statements of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries.

(b) Transactions and bala nces 
 
Foreign currency transactions are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rates on 
the transaction dates. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the liquidation of these 
transactions and from the translation at the closing exchange rates of the monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency are shown in the consolidated statement of income by 
function except when deferred in Other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.  
 
(c) Adjustment due to hy perinflation  
 
After July 1, 2018, the Argentine economy was considered, for purposes of IFRS, hyperinflationary. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Argentine Peso have 
been restated.  
 
The non -monetary items of the  statement of financial position as well as the income statement , 
comprehensive incomes and cash flows of the group's entities, whose functional currency 
corresponds to a hyperinflationary economy, are adjusted for inflation and re -expressed in 
accordance with the variation of the consumer price index ("CPI"), at each presentation date of its 
financial statements. The re -expression of non -monetary items is made from the date of initial 
recognition in the statements of financial position and considering that  the financial statements are 
prepared unde r the historical  cost criterion.  
 
Net losses or gains arising from the re -expression of non -monetary items and income and costs are 
recognized in the consolidated income statement under "Result of indexation  units ". 
 
Net gains and losses on the re -expression of opening balances due to the initial application                  
of IAS 29 are recognized in the consolidated retained earnings.  
 
Re-expression due to hyperinflation will be recorded until the period in whic h the economy of the 
entity ceases to be considered as a hyperinflationary economy, at that time, the adjustments made 
by hyperinflation will be part of the cost of non -monetary assets and liabilities.  
 
The comparative amounts in the Consolidated financial  statements of the Company are presented in 
a stable currency and are not adjusted for subsequent changes in the price level or exchange rates.  
 
(d) Group entities  
 
The results and the financial situation of the Group's entities, whose functional currency is different 
from the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements, of LATAM Airlines Group 
S.A., which does not correspond to the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, are converted into 
the currency of presentation as follows:  
 
(i) Assets and liabilities of each consolidated statement of financial position presented are 
translated at the closing exchange rate on the consolidated statement of financial position date;  
 
(ii) The revenues and expenses of each income statement account are  translated at the exchange 
rates prevailing on the transaction dates, and  
 14 
 
(iii) All the resultant exchange differences by conversion are shown as a separate component in  
other comprehensive income.  
 
For those subsidiaries of the group whose functional cu rrency is different from the presentation 
currency and, moreover, corresponds to the currency of a hyperinflationary economy; its restated 
results, cash flow and financial situation are converted to the presentation currency at the closing 
exchange rate on  the date of the consolidated financial statements.  
 
The exchange rates used correspond to those fixed in the country where the subsidiary is located, 
whose functional currency is different to the U.S. dollar.  
    
Adjustments to the Goodwill and fair value  arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing e xchange rate or 
period inform ed, restated when the currency came from  the functional entity of the foreign enti ty 
corresponds to that of a hyperinflationary economy, the adjustments for the restatement of goodwill 
are recognized in the consolidated equity. 
 
2.4. Property, plant and equipment  
 
The land of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries, are recognized at cost less any 
accumulated impairment loss. The rest of the Properties, plants and equipment are recorded, both in 
their initial recognition and in their  subsequent measur ement, at their historical cost, restated for 
inflation when appropriate, less the corresponding depreciation and any loss due to deterioration.  
 
The amounts of advances paid to the aircraft manufacturers are activated by the Company unde r 
Construction in progress until they are received.  
Subsequent costs (replacement of components, improvements, extensions, etc.) are included in the 
value of the initial asset or are recognized as a separate asset, only when it is probable that the 
future economic benefits associated with the elements of propert y, plant and equipment , they will 
flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. The value of the replaced 
component is written off. The rest of the repairs and maintenance are charged to the result of the 
year in which they are incurred. 
The depreciation of the properties, plants and equipment is calculated using the linear method over 
their estimated technical useful lives; except in the case of certain technical components  which are 
depreciated on the basis of cycles and hours flown.  
The residual value and the useful life of the assets are reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, once a 
year.   
When the value of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, its value is imm ediately 
reduced to its recoverable amount (Note 2.8). 
Losses and gains from the sale of property, plant and equipment are calculated by comparing the 
consideration with the book value and are included in the consolidated statement of income.

2.5. Intan gible assets other than goodwill  
(a) Airport slots and Loyalty program  
 
Airport slots and the Coalition and Loyalty program are intangible assets of indefinite useful life 
and are subject to impairment tests annually as an integral part of each CGU  identified by the 
Company , in accordance with the premises that are applicable, included as follows:  
 
Airport slots – Air transport CGU  
Loyalty program – Air transport CGU   
(See Note 16)   
 
The airport slots correspond to an administrative authorization to carry out operations of arrival and 
departure of aircraft at a specific airport, within a specified period.  
 
The Loyalty program corresponds to the system of accumulation and redemption of points that has 
developed Multip lus S.A., program that is part of TAM Linhas Aereas S.A. (See Note 1).  
 
The Brands, airport Slots and Loyalty program were recognized  in fair values determined in 
accordance with IFRS 3, as a consequence of the business combination with TAM and Subsidiaries . 
 
(b) Computer software  
 
Licenses for computer  software acquired are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred in 
acquiring them and preparing them for using the specific software. These costs are amortized over 
their estimated useful lives, for which the Company has been defined useful lives                              
between 3 and 10 years.   
 
Expenses related to the development or maintenance of computer software which do not qualify for 
capitalization, are shown as an expense when incurred. The personnel costs and others cost directly 
related  to the production of unique and identifiable computer software controlled by the Company, 
are shown as intangible Assets others than Goodwill when they have met all the criteria for 
capitalization.  
 
(c) Brands  
The Brands were acquired in the business comb ination with TAM S.A. And Subsidiaries and 
recognized at fair value under IFRS. During the year 2016, the estimated useful life of the brands 
changes  from an indefinite useful life to a five -year period, the period in which the value of the 
brands will be amortized (See Note 15).  
 
2.6. Goodwill  
 
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Company’s 
participation in the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary or associate  on the acquisition date. 
Goodwill related to acquisition of subsidiaries is not amortized but tested for impairment annually  
or each time that there is evidence of impairment . Gains and losses on the sale of an entity include  
the book amount of the goodwill related to the entity sold.   
 
 
 16 
 
2.7. Borrowing costs  
 
Interest costs incurred for the construction of any qualified asset are capitali zed over the time 
necessary for completing and preparing the asset for its intended use.  
 
2.8. Losses for impairment of non -financial assets  
 
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and developing IT projects are not subject to 
amortization and are subject to annual tests for impairment losses or if there are indications of 
impairment. Management conducts an impairment assess ment annually or more frequently if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. An impairment loss is recognized for the 
amount by which the carrying amount of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable a mount of the cash generating unit is the higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell. The value in use is determined by management using a discounted cash flow model. 
For the purpose of assessing impairment losses, assets are grouped at the lo west level for which 
there are separately identif iable cash flows (cash generating units). Prior impairments of non -
financial assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.  
 
2.9. Financial assets  
 
As of January 1, 2018, the Company classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair 
value (either through other comprehensive income, or through gains or losses), a nd at amortized 
cost. The classification depends on the business model of the entity to manage the financial assets 
and the contractual terms of the cash flows.  
 
The group reclassifies debt investments when , and only when , it changes its business model to 
manage those assets.  
 
In the initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of 
a financial asset classified at amortized cost, the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the f inancial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets accounted for at fair value 
through profit or loss are recorded as ex penses in the income statement.  
 
(a) Debt instruments  
 
The subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the group's business  model to manage 
the asset and cash flow characteristics of the asset. The Company has two measurement categories 
in which the group classifies its debt instruments:  
 
Amortized cost: the assets held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows 
represent only payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost. A gain or loss on 
a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortized cost and is not part of a hedging 
relationship is recognized in income when the asse t is derecognized or impaired. Interest income 
from these financial assets is included in financial income using the effective interest rate method.  
 
Fair value through profit or loss: assets that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVO CI are 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is 
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is 
recognized in profit or loss and is presented net in the income statement within other gains / (losses) 
in the period in which it arises.

(b) Equity instruments  
 
Changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in 
other gains / (losses) in the statement of income as appr opriate.  
The Company evaluates in advance the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments 
recorded at amortized cost. The applied impairment methodology depends on whether there has 
been a significant increase in credit risk.  
 
2.10.  Derivat ive financial instruments and hedging activities  
 
Derivatives are recognized, in accordance with IAS 39  for hedge accounting a nd IFRS 9 for 
derivatives not qualify as hedge accounting , initially at fair value on the date on which the 
derivative contract was made and are subsequently valued at their fair value. The method to 
recognize the resulting loss or gain depends on whether the derivative has been designated as a 
hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Company designates certain 
derivatives as:  
 
(a) Hedge of the fair value of recognized assets (fair value hedge);  
 
(b) Hedge of an identified ris k associated with a recognized liability or an expected                  
highly - Probable transaction (cash -flow hedge), or  
(c) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.  
 
The Company documents, at the inception of each transaction, the relatio nship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, as well as its objectives for managing risk and the strategy for 
carrying out various hedging transactions. The Company also documents its assessment, both at the 
beginning and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the derivatives used in the hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the items being 
hedged.  
 
The total fair value of the hedging derivatives is booked as Other non -current financi al asset or 
liability if the remaining maturity of the item hedged is over 12 months, and as an other current 
financial asset or liability if the remaining term of the item hedged is less than 12 months.  
Derivatives not booked as hedges are classified as O ther financial assets or liabilities. 
 
(a)  Fair value hedges  
 
Changes in the fair value of designated derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are shown in the 
consolidated statement of income, together with any change in the fair value of the asset or liability 
hedged that is attributable to the risk being hedged.  
 
(b) Cash flow hedges  
 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as 
cash flow hedges is shown in the statement of other comprehensive  income. The loss or gain 
relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the consolid ated statement of 
income under o ther gains (losses). Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss 
in the periods when the hedged item  affects profit or loss.  
In case of variable interest -rate hedges, the amounts recognized in the statement of o ther 
comprehensive income are reclassified to results within financial costs at the same time the 
associated debts accrue interest.  18 
 
For fuel pric e hedges, the amounts shown in the statement of o ther comprehensive income are 
reclassified to results under the line item Cost of sales to the extent that the fuel subject to the hedge 
is used.  
 
For foreign currency hedges, the amounts recognized in the s tatement of o ther comprehensive 
income are reclassified to income as deferred revenue resulting from the use of points, are 
recognized as Income.  
 
When hedging instrument mature , is sold or fails to  meet the requirements to be accounted for as 
hedges, any gain or loss accumulated in the statement of Other comprehensive income until that 
moment , remains in the statement of other comprehensive income and is reclassified to the 
consolidated statement of income when the hedged transaction is finally recognized.  When it is 
expected that the hedged transaction is no longer going to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in the 
statement of other comprehensive income is taken immediately to the consolidated statement of 
income as “Other gains (losses)”.  
 
(c) Derivativ es not booked as a hedge  
 
The changes in fair value of any derivative instrument that is not booked as a hedge are shown 
immediately in the consolidated statement of income in “Other gains (losses)”.  
 
2.11.  Inventories  
 
Inventories, detailed in Note 10, are shown at the lower of cost and their net realizable value . The 
cost is determined on the basis of the weighted average cost method (WAC). The net realizable 
value is th e estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale.  
 
2.12.  Trade and other accounts receivable  
 
Commercial accounts receivable are initially recognized at their fair value and subsequently at their 
amortized cost in accordance with the effective rate method, less the provision for impairment 
according to the model of the expected credit losses . The Company applies the simplified approach 
permitted by IFRS 9, which requires that expected lifetime losses be recognized upon initial 
recognition of accounts receivable.  
 
In the event that the Company transfers its rights to any financial asset (gener ally accounts 
receivable) to a third party in exchange for a cash payment, the Company evaluates whether all 
risks and rewards have been transferred, in which case the account receivable is derecognized.  
 
The existence of significant financial difficulties  on the part of the debtor, the probability that the 
debtor goes bankrupt or financial reorganization are considered indicators of a significant increase 
in credit risk.  
 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced as the provision account is used and the loss is 
recognized in the consolidated income statement under "Cost of sales". When an account receivable 
is written off, it is regularized against the provision account for the account receivable.

2.13.  Cash and cash equivalents  
 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and bank balances, time deposits in financial institutions, 
and other short -term and highly liquid investments.  
 
2.14.  Capital  
 
The common shares are classified as net equity.  
 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or options are shown in net 
equity as a deduction from the proceed s received from the placement of shares.  
 
2.15.  Trade and other accounts payables  
 
Trade payables and other accounts payable are initially recognize d at fair value and subsequently at 
amortized cost.  
 
2.16.  Interest -bearing loans  
 
Financial liabilities are shown initially at their fair value, net of the c osts incurred in the transaction. 
Later, these financial liabilities are valued at their amortized cost; any difference between the 
proceeds obtained (net of the necessary arrangement| costs) and the repayment value, is shown in 
the consolidated statement of income during the term of the debt, according to the effective interest 
rate method.  
 
Financial liabilities are classified in current and non -current liabilities according to the contractual 
payment dates of the nominal principal. 
 
2.17.  Current and def erred taxes  
 
The tax expense for the period comprises income and deferred taxes.  
 
The current income tax expense is calculated based on tax laws in enacted  the date of statement of 
financial position, in the countries in which the subsidiaries and associates operate and generate 
taxable income.  
 
Deferred taxes are recognized, on the temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabiliti es and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, 
deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an assets or a 
liability in transaction other than a business combination that at the tim e of the transaction does not 
affect the accounting or the taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates (and 
laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the date of the consolidated statements of 
financial position, a nd are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realized or the 
deferred tax liability discharged.  
 
Deferred tax assets a re recognized only to the extent  it is probable that the future taxable profit will 
be available against which the temp orary differences can be utilized.  
 
The tax (current and deferred) is recognized in statement of income by function, unless it relates to 
an item recognized in other comprehensive income, directly in equity. In this case the tax is also 20 
 
recognized in other  comprehensive income or, directly in the statement of income by function, 
respectively . 
 
2.18.  Employee benefits  
  
(a)  Personnel vacations  
 
The Company recognizes  the expense for personnel vacations on an accrual basis.   
 
(b)  Share -based compensation  
 
The compensation plans implemented based on the shares of the Company are recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 2: Share -based  payments, for plans 
based on the granting of options, the effect of fair value is recorded in equity with a charge to 
remuneration in a linear manner between the date of grant of said options and the date on which 
they become irrevocable, for the plans co nsidered as cash settled award the fair value, updated as of 
the closing date of each reporting period, is recorded as a liability with charge to remuneration.  
 
(c)        Post -employment and other long -term benefits  
 
Provisions are made for these obligati ons by applying the method of the projected unit credit 
method, and considering  estimates of future permanence, mortality rates and future wage increases 
determined on the basis of actuarial calculations. The discount rates are determined by reference to 
market interest -rate curves. Actuarial gains or losses are shown in other com prehensive income.  
 
(d)  Incentives  
 
The Company has an annual incentives plan for its personnel for compliance with objectives and 
individual contribution to the results. The ince ntives eventually granted consist of a given number 
or portion of monthly remuneration and the provision is made on the basis of the amount estimated 
for distribution.   
 
2.19.  Provisions  
 
Provisions are recognized when:  
 
(i) The Company has a present legal or implicit obligation as a result of past events;  
 
(ii) It is probable that payment is going to be necessary to settle an obligation; and  
 
(iii) The amount has been rel iably estimated .  
 
 
2.20.  Revenue from contracts with customers  
 
(a) Transportation of passengers and cargo  
 
The Company recognizes the sale for the transportati on service as a deferred income liability, 
which is recognized as income when the transportation service has been lent or expired. In the case 
of air transport services sold by the Company and that will be made by other airlines, the liability is 
reduced w hen they are remitted to said airlines. The Company periodically reviews whether it is 
necessary to make an adjustment to deferred income liabilities, mainly related to returns, changes, 
among others.

Compensations granted to clients for changes in the le vels of services or billing of additional 
services such as additional baggage, change of seat, among others, are considered modifications of 
the initial contract, therefore, they are deferred until the corresponding service is provided.  
 
(b) Expiration of air tickets  
 
The Company estimates in a monthly basis  the probability of expiration of air tickets, with refund 
clauses, based on the history of use of the same. Air tickets without refund clause are expired on the 
date of the flight in case the passenger does not show up.  
 
(c) Costs associated with the contract  
 
The costs related to the sale of air tickets are activated and deferred until the corresponding service 
is provided. These assets are included under Other non -financial assets in the Consolidated 
Classified Statement of Financial Position.  
 
(d) Frequent passenger program  
 
The Company maintains the following loyalty programs: LATAM Pass, LATAM Pass Brasil, 
whose objective is building customer loyalty through the delivery of miles or points.  
 
Members of these programs accumulate miles when flying with LATAM Airlines Group or any 
other member airline of the oneworld® program, as well purchasing of products and services from 
network of non airlines partners. 
 
When the miles and points are exchanged for p roducts and services other than the services provided 
by the Company, the income is immediately recognized. When the miles are redeemed through air 
tickets of an airline of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and subsidiaries, the income is deferred until 
the transp ortation service are rendered or expiration for non -use. 
 
In addition, the Company has contracts with certain non -airline companies for the sale of miles or 
points. These contracts include some performance obligations in addition to the sale of the mile or  
point, such as marketing, advertising and other benefits. The income associated with these concepts 
is recognized in the income statement to the extent that the miles are accredited.  
 
Deferred income of loyalty programs is determined based on the estimate d stand -alone selling price 
of unused miles and points awarded to the members of the loyalty programs, reduced for breakage.  
 
The miles and points that the Company estimates will not be exchanged are recognized at the 
moment of the earn. Management uses st atistical models to estimate the breakage based on the 
latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns.  
 
(e) Dividend income  
 
Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.  
 22 
 
2.21.  Leases  
 
The Company recognizes contracts that meet the definition of a lease, as a right  of use asset and a 
lease liability on the date when the underlying asset is available for use.  
 
 
Asset s for right of use are measured at cost including the following:  
 
- The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability ; 
- Lease payment made at or before commencement date;  
- Initial direct costs, and 
- Restoration costs . 
 
The assets by right of use are recognized in the statement of fin ancial position in Properties, p lants 
and equipment (See Note 17).  
 
Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following payments : 
- Fixed payments including in substance  fixed payment.  
- Variable lease payments that depend  on an index or a rate ; 
- The e xercise price of a purchase options, if is reasona bly certain to exercise that option . 
 
The Company determines the present value of the lease paym ents using the implicit rates for the  
aircraft leasing contracts and for  the rest of the underlying asset s, uses the incremental borrowing  
rate. 
 
Lease liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position under Other financial 
liabilities, current or non -current (See Note 19).   
 
Interest accrued on financial liabi lities is recognized in the consolidated  statement of income in 
"Financial costs" .  
 
Principal and interest  are presented in the consolidated cash flow as “Payments of lease liability” 
and “Interest paid” , respectively , in cash flows use in  financing activ ities.  
 
Payments associated with short -term leases without purchase options and leases of low -value assets 
are recognized on a straight -line basis in profit or loss at the time of accrual. Tho se payments are 
presented in cash flows use in  operat ion activit ies. 
 
The C ompany analyzes the financing agreements of aircrafts, mainly considering characteristics 
such as:  
 
(a) that the C ompany initially acquired the aircraft or took an important part in the process of direct 
acquisition wit h the manufacturers.  
  
(b) Due to the contractual conditions, it  is virtually certain that the C ompany will execute the 
purchase option of the aircraft at the end of the lease term.  
 
Since these financing agreements are "substantially purchases" and not leases, the related liabil ity is 
considered as a financial debt classified under IFRS 9 and continue to be presented within the

"other finan cial liabilities" described in N ote 19. On the other hand, aircr aft are presented in 
Property, plants and e quipment as described in N ote 17, a s "own aircrafts" . 
 
The Group qualifies as sale and leaseback transactions, operations which lead to a sale according to 
IFRS 15. More specifically, a sale is considered as such if there is no repurchase option on the 
goods at the end of the lease term.  
 
If the sale of the seller -lessee is classified as a sale in accordance with IFRS 15, the underlying 
asset is derecognized and an asset is recognized for the right to use equal to the retained part of the 
net carrying  amount of the asset.  
 
If the sale by th e seller -lessee is not qualified as a sale in accordance with IFRS 15, the assets 
transferred are maintained in the fina ncial statements and a financial liability is recognized equal to 
the sale price (received from the buyer -lessor).  
 
2.22.  Non-current as sets or disposal groups classified as held for sale  
 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as assets held for sale are shown at the lesser of 
their book value and the fair value less costs to sell.  
 
2.23.  Maintenance  
 
The costs incurred for scheduled heavy maintenance of  the aircraft’s fuselage and engines are 
capitalized and depreciated until the next maintenance. The depreciation rate is determined on 
technical grounds, according to the use of the aircraft expressed in terms of cycles and flight hours.  
 
In case of aircraft include in property, plant and equipment , these maintenance cost are capitalized 
as Property, plant and equipment, while in the case of aircraft on right of use , a liability is accrued 
based on the use of the main components is recognized, since a cont ractual obligation with the 
lessor to return the aircraft on agreed terms of maintenance levels exists. These are recognized as 
Cost of sales.  
 
Additionally, some contracts that comply with the definition of lease establish the obligation of the 
lessee to make deposits to the lessor as a guarantee of compliance with maintenance and return 
conditions . These deposits, often called maintenance reserves, accumulate until a major 
maintenance is performed, once made, the recovery is requested to the lessor. At th e end of the 
contract period, there is comparison between the reserves that have been paid and required return 
conditions, and compensation between the parties are made if applicable.  
 
The unscheduled maintenance of aircraft and engines, as well as minor m aintenance, are charged to 
results as incurred.  
 
2.24.  Environmental costs  
 
Disbursements related to environmental protection are charged to results when incurred .

NOTE 3 - FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
 
3.1. Financial risk factors 
 
The Company is exposed to different financial risks: (a) market risk, (b) credit risk, and                         
(c) liquidity risk. The program overall risk management of the Company aims to minimize the 
adverse effects of financial risks affecting the company.  
 
 
 
 
(a)  Market risk  
 
Due to the nature of its operatio ns, the Company is exposed to market factors such as: (i) fuel -price 
risk, (ii) exchange -rate risk  (FX) , and (iii) interest -rate risk . 
 
The Company has developed policies and procedures for managing market risk, which aim to 
identify, quantify, monitor a nd mitigate the adverse effects of changes in market factors mentioned 
above.  
 
For this, the Administration monitors the evolution of price levels, exchange rates and interest rates, 
and quantifies their risk exposures (Value at Risk), and develops and imp lements hedging 
strategies.  
 
(i) Fuel-price risk:  
 
Exposition:  
 
For the execution of its operations the Company purchases a fuel called Jet Fuel grade 54 USGC, 
which is subject to the fluctuations of international fuel prices.  
 
Mitigation:  
 
To cover the risk e xposure fuel, the Company operates with derivative instruments (swaps and 
options) whose underlying assets may be different from Jet Fuel, being possible use West Texas 
Intermediate (“WTI”) crude, Brent (“BRENT”) crude and distillate Heating Oil (“HO”), wh ich have 
a hig h correlation with Jet Fuel and greater  liquidity . 
 
Fuel Hedging Results:  
 
During the period ended december 31 , 2019,  the Company recognized losses of  US$ 23.1 million  for 
fuel coverage  net of premium . During the same period of 201 8, the Com pany recognized gains  of 
US$ 29.7 million for the same concept.  
As of december 31 , 2019 , the market value of fuel positions amounted to US$ 48.5 million 
(positive ). At the end of december 201 8, this market value was US$ 15.8 million ( negative ).

(*)   The volume shown in the table considers all the hedging instruments (swaps and options).  
 
Sensitivity analysis  
 
A drop in fuel price positively affects the Company through a reduction in costs. However, also 
negatively affects contr acted positions as these are acquired to protect the Company against the risk 
of a rise in price. The policy therefore is to maintain a hedge -free percentage in order to be 
competitive in the event of a drop in price.  
 
The current hedge positions they are booked as cash flow hedge contracts, so a variation in the fuel 
price has an impact on the Company’s net equity.  
 
The following table shows the sensitivity analysis of the financial instruments according to 
reasonable changes in the fuel price and their ef fect on equity. The term of the projection was 
defined until the end of the last current fuel hedge contract, being the last business day of the third  
quarter  of 2020 . 
 
The calculations were made considering a parallel movement of US$ 5 per barrel in the c urve of the 
JET crude futures benchmark price at the end of  December  2019  and the en d of                 
December  2018.

Given the structure of fuel coverage during 2019 , considers a hedge -free portion, a vertical drop of 
5 dollars in the JET reference price (considered as t he monthly average), would have meant an 
approximate impact US $ 121.8 million of lower fuel costs. For the same period , a vertical rise             
of US$ 5 in the JET reference price (considered as the monthly average) would have meant an 
impact of appro ximately US $ 114.2 million of higher fuel costs.

(ii) Foreign exchange rate risk:  
 
Exposition:  
 
The functional an d presentation currency of the financial s tatements of the Parent Company is the 
US dollar, so that the risk of the Transactional and Con version exchange rate arises mainly from the 
Company's business, strategic and accounting operating activities that are expressed in a monetary 
unit other than the functional currency.  
 
The subsidiaries of LATAM are also exposed to foreign exchange risk wh ose impact affects the 
Company's Consolidated Income.  
 
The largest operational exposure to LATAM's exchange risk comes from the concentration of 
businesses in Brazil, which are mostly denominated in Brazilian Real (BRL), and are actively 
managed by the com pany.  
 
At a lower concentration, the Company is also exposed to the fluctuation of other currencies, such 
as: Euro, Pound sterling, Australian dollar, Colombian peso, Chilean pe so, Argentine peso, 
Paraguayan G uarani, M exican peso, Peruvian S ol and New Zeal and dollar.  
 
Mitigation : 
 
The Company mitigates currency risk exposures by contracting derivative instruments or through 
natural hedges or execution of internal operations.  
 
Exchange Rate Hedging Results  (FX) : 
 
With the objective of reducing exposure to th e exchange rate risk in the operational cash flows of 
2019, and securing the operating margin, LATAM makes hedges using FX derivatives.  
 
As of december 31 , 2019, the market value of FX derivative positions amounted to US $ 0. 04 
million ( negative). At the e nd of December 2018, the Company did not maintain derivatives of 
current FX hedges.  
 
During the period ended december 31, 2019 , the Company recognized gains  of US $ 1.9 million for 
FX coverage  net of premiums . During the same period of 2018 , the C ompany re cognized gains  of 
US$ 18.3 million.  
 
As of december 31 , 2019, the Company has contracted FX derivatives for US $ 15 million for BRL. 
At the end of d ecember 2018, the Company did not maintain current FX derivatives.  
 
During 2018 the company contracted FX de rivatives which were not registered under hedge 
accounting. As of december 31 , 2019, the amount recognized in results amounts to US $ 6.2 million 
(negative) net of premiums.  
 
Sensitivity analysis:  
 
A depreciation of the R$/US$ exchange rate, negatively aff ects the Company's operating cash 
flows, however, also positively affects the value of the positions of derivatives contracted.

FX derivatives are recorded as cash flow hedge contracts;  therefore, a variation in the exchange rate 
has an impact on the mark et value of the derivatives, the changes of which a ffect the Company's net 
equity.  
 
The following table shows the sensitization of FX derivative instruments according to reasonable 
changes in the exchange rate and its effect on equity. The projection perio d was defined until the 
end of the last coverage contract in force, with the last business day of the first quarter of the year

During 2018 and 2019, the Company contracted swap currency derivatives for debt coverage issued 
the same year for a notional UF 8.7 mill ion and UF 5.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 
2019, the market value of the currency swaps derivative positions amounted to US $ 22.7 million 
(negative).  At the end of December 2018, this market value was US $ 15.1 million (positive).  
In the cas e of TAM S.A, whose functional currency is the Brazilian real, a large part of its liabilities 
is expressed in US dollars. Therefore, when converting financial assets and liabilities, from dollar to 
real, they have an impact on the result of TAM S.A., whic h is consolidated in the Company's 
Income Statement.  
In order to reduce the impact on the Company's result caused by appreciations or depreciations of R 
$ / US $, the Company has executed internal operations to reduce the net exposure in US $ for 
TAM S.A.

Effects of exchange rate derivatives in the Financial Statements  
The profit or losses caused by changes in the fair value of hedgin g instruments are segregated 
between intrinsic value and temporary value. The intrinsic value is the actual percentage of cash 
flow covered, initially shown in equity and later transferred to income, while the hedge transaction 
is recorded in income. The t emporary value corresponds to the ineffective portion of cash flow 
hedge which is recognized in the financial results of the Company (Note 1 9). 
 28 
 
Due to the functional currency of TAM S.A. and Subsidiaries is the Brazilian real, the Company 
presents the eff ects of the exchange rate fluctuations in Other comprehensive income by converting 
the Statement of financial position and Income statement of TAM S.A. and Subsidiaries from their 
functional currency to the U.S. dollar, which is the presentation currency o f the consolidated 
financial statement of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries. The Goodwill generated in 
the Business combination is recognized as an asset of TAM S.A. and Subsidiaries in Brazilian real 
whose conversion to U.S. d ollar also produces effects in o ther comprehensive income.

(iii) Interest -rate risk:  
 
Exposition:  
 
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates affect ing the markets future cash flows of 
the assets, and current and future financial liabilities.  
 
The Company is exposed in one portion to the variations of London Inter -Bank Offer Rate 
(“LIBOR”) and other interest rates of less relevance are Brazilian In terbank Deposit Certificate 
("IDC"). 
 
Mitigation : 
 
In order to reduce the risk of an eventual rise in interest rates, the Company has signed interest -rate 
swap and call  option contracts . Currently a 62% (60% at December 31, 2018 ) of the debt is fixed to 
fluctuations in interest rate.  
 
Rate Hedging Results : 
 
As of december 31 , 2019 , the market value of the derivative positions of interest rates amounted to   
US $ 2.6 million ( positive). At the end of December 2018, this market value was US $ 2 .2 million 
(negat ive). 
 
Sensitivity analysis: 
  
The following table shows the sensitivity of changes in financial obligations that are not hedged 
against interest -rate variations. These changes are considered reasonably possible, based on current 
market conditions  each dat e.

Much of the current rate derivatives are registered for as hedges of cash flow, therefore, a variation 
in the exchange rate has an impact on the market value of derivatives, whose chang es impact on the 
Company’s net equity.  
 
The calculations were made increasing (decreasing) vertically 100 basis points of the three -month 
Libor futures curve, being both reasonably possible scenarios according to historical market 
conditions.

The assumptions of sensitivity calculation must assume that forward curves of interest rates do not 
necessarily reflect the real value of the compensation flows. Moreover, the structure of interest rates 
is dynamic over time.  
 
During the p eriods presented, the Company has no registered amounts by ineffectiveness in 
consolidated statement of i ncome for this kind of hedging.  
 
(b) Credit risk  
 
Credit risk occurs when the counterparty to a financial agreement or instrument fails to discharge an  
obligation due or financial instrument, leading to a loss in market value of a financial instrument 
(only financial assets, not liabilities).  
 
The Company is exposed to credit risk due to its operative and financial activities, including 
deposits with ban ks and financial institutions, investments in other kinds of instruments, exchange -
rate transactions and the contracting of derivative instruments or options.  
 
To reduce the credit risk associated with operational activities, the Company has established cr edit 
limits to abridge the exposure of their debtors which are monitored permanently (mainly in case of 
operational activities in Brazil with travel agents).  
 
As a way to mitigate credit risk related to financial activities, the Company requires that the 
counterparty to the financial activities remain at least investment grade by major Risk Assessm ent 
Agencies. Additionally,  the C ompany has established maximum limits for investments which are 
monitored regularly.  
 
 
 
 30 
 
(i) Financial activities  
 
Cash surpluses tha t remain after the financing of assets necessary for the operation are invested 
according to credit limits approved by the Company’s Board, mainly in time deposits with different 
financial institutions, private investment funds, short -term mutual funds, an d easily -liquidated 
corporate and sovereign bonds with short remaining maturities. These investments are booked as  
Cash and cash equivalents and o ther current financial assets.  
 
In order to reduce counterparty risk and to ensure that the risk assumed is kn own and managed by 
the Company, investments are diversified among different banking institutions (both local and 
international). The Company evaluates the credit standing of each counterparty and the levels of 
investment, based on (i) their credit rating, (ii) the equity size of the counterparty, and                             
(iii) investment limits according to the Company’s level of liquidity. According to these three 
parameters, the Company chooses the most restrictive parameter of the previous three a nd based on 
this, establishes limits for operations with each counterparty.  
 
The Company has no guarantees to mitigate this exposure.  
 
(ii)       Operational activities  
 
The Company has four large sales “clusters”: travel agencies, cargo agents, airlines a nd credit -card 
administrators. The first three are governed by International Air Transport Association, 
international (“IATA”) organization comprising most of the airlines that represent over 90% of 
scheduled commercial traffic and one of its main objectiv es is to regulate the financial transactions 
between airlines and travel agents and cargo. When an agency or airline does not pay their debt, 
they are excluded from operating with IATA’s member airlines. In the case of credit -card 
administrators, they are fully guaranteed by 100% by the issuing institutions.  
 
The exposure consists of the term granted, which fluctuates between 1 and 45 days.  
 
One of the tools the Company uses for reducing credit risk is to participate in global entities related 
to the industry, such as IATA, Business Sales Processing (“BSP”), Cargo Account Settlement 
Systems (“CASS”), IATA Clearing House (“ICH”) and banks (credit cards). These institutions 
fulfill the role of collectors and distributors between airlines and travel and cargo a gencies. In the 
case of the Clearing House, it acts as an offsetting entity between airlines for the services provided 
between them. A reduction in term and implementation of guarantees has been achieved through 
these entities. Currently the sales invoicin g of TAM Linhas Aéreas S.A. related with travel agents 
and cargo agents for domestic transportation in Brazil is done directly by TAM Linhas Aéreas S.A.  
Credit quality of financial assets  
The external credit evaluation system used by the Company is provide d by IATA. Internal systems 
are also used for particular evaluations or specific markets based on trade reports available on the 
local market. The internal classification system is complementary to the external one, i.e. for 
agencies or airlines not member s of IATA, the internal demands are greater.  
 
To reduce the credit risk associated with operational activities, the Company has established credit 
limits to abridge the exposure of their debtors which are monitored permanently (mainly in case of 
operational activities of TAM Linhas Aéreas S.A. with travel agents ). The bad-debt rate in the 
principal countries where the Company has a presence is insignificant.

(c) Liquidity risk  
 
Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Company has no sufficient funds to  meet its obligations.  
 
Because of the cyclical nature of the business, the operation, and its investment and financing needs 
related to the acquisition of new aircraft and renewal of its fleet, plus the financing needs, the 
Company requires liquid funds, defined as cash and cash equivalents plus other short term financial 
assets, t o meet its payment obligations.  The liquid funds, the future cash generation and the 
capacity to obtain additional funding, through bond issuance and banking loans, will allow t he 
Company to obtain sufficient alternatives to face its investment and financing future commitments.  
 
At december 31 , 2019 is US$  1,459 million  (US$ 1, 404 million at december 31, 2018 ), invested in 
short term instruments through financial high credit rati ng levels entities.  
 
In addition to the balance of liquid funds, the Company has access to short -term credit lines. As of 
december 31, 2019,  LATAM has credit lines for working capital that are not committed to several 
banks and additionally has  an unused committed line of US $ 600 million (US$ 600 million as of 
December 31, 2018 ) subject to availability of collateral.

 The Company has fuel, interest rate and exchange rate hedging strategies inv olving derivatives 
contracts with different financial institutions. The Company has margin facilities with each 
financial institution in order to regulate the mutual exposure produced by changes in the market 
valuation of the derivatives. 
 
At the end of 20 18, the Company had delivered US$ 5.0  million in guarantees for derivative 
margins, corresponding to cash and standby letters of credit. As of December  31, 2019 , US$ 23.7 
million were delivered in guarantees corresponding to cash and standby letters of cre dit. The 
increase was due to: i) the expiration of hedge contra cts, ii) acquisition of new hedge  contracts, and 
iii) changes in fuel prices, changes in exchange rates and interest rates.  
 
3.2. Capital risk management  
 
The Company’s objectives, with respect to the management of capital, are (i) to comply with the 
restrictions of minimum equity and (ii) to maintain an optimal capital structure.  
 
The Company monitors its contractual  obligations and the regulatory limitations in the different 
countries where the entities of the group are domiciled to assure they meet the limit of minimum net 
equity, where the most restrictive limitation is to maintain a positive net equity.  
 
Additiona lly, the Company periodically monitors the short and long term cash flow projections to 
assure the Company has adequate sources of funding to generate the cash requirement to face its 
investment and funding future commitments.  
 
The Company international c redit rating is the consequence of the Company capacity to face its 
long terms financing commitments. As of December  31, 2019  the Company has an international 
long term credit rating of BB - with stable outlook  by Standard & Poor’s, a BB- rating with stable  
outlook  by Fitch Ratings and a B a3 rating with stable outlook by Moody’s.  
 
3.3.  Estimates of fair value.  
 
At december 31, 2019,  the Company maintained financial instruments th at should be recorded at fair 
value.  These are grouped into two categories:  
 
1. Hedge Instruments:  
 
This category includes the following instruments:  
 
- Interest rate derivative contracts,  
 
- Fuel derivative contracts, 
 
- Currency derivative contracts . 
 
2. Finan cial Investments:  
 
This category includes the following instruments:  
 
- Investments in short -term Mutual Funds (cash equivalent)  
 
- Private investment funds .  
 
The Company has classified the fair value measurement using a hierarchy that reflects the level of 
information used in the assessment. This hierarchy consists of 3 levels (I) fair value based on 39 
 
 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities , (II) fair value calculated through 
valuation methods based on i nputs other than quoted price s included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived 
from prices)  and (III) fair value based on i nputs for the asset or liability that are not b ased on 
observable mar ket data.  
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets, such as investments acquired for 
trading, is based on quoted market prices at the close of the period using the current price of the 
buyer. The fair value of financial assets not t raded in active markets (derivative contracts) is 
determined using valuation techniques that maximize use of available market information.  
Valuation techniques generally used by the Company are quoted market prices of similar 
instruments and / or estimati ng the present value of future cash flows using forward price curves of 
the market at period end.  
The following table shows the classification of financial instruments at fair value, depending on the 
level of information used in the assessment:

Book Fair
 
 
The book values of accounts receivable and payable are assumed to app roximate their fair values, 
due to their short -term nature. In the case of cash on hand, bank balances, overnight, time deposits 
and accounts payable, non -current, fair value approximates their carrying values.  
 
The fair value of o ther financial liabilitie s is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash 
flows at the current market interest rate for similar financial instruments  (Level II) . In the case of 
Other financial assets, the valuation was performed according to market prices at period end.  The 
book value of Other financial liabilities, current or non -current, do not include lease liabilities . 
 
 
NOTE 4 - ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  
 
The Company has used estimates to value and record so me of the assets, liabilities, income, 
expenses and commitments. Basically , these estimates refer to:  
 
(a) Evaluation of possible losses due to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with 
indefinite useful life  
 
As of december 31 , 2019 , goodwill amou nt to ThUS$ 2,209,576  (ThUS$ 2, 294,072 as of december 
31, 2018 ), while the intangible assets comprise the Airport Slots for ThUS$ 845,959  (ThUS $ 
828,969 as of december 31, 201 8) and Loyalty Program for ThUS$ 263,806 (ThUS$ 274,420  as of 
december 31, 2018 ). 41 
 
  
Management conducts an impairment test annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate potential impairment. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by 
which the carrying amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) exceeds  its recoverable amount. For 
this evaluation, the Company had identified two CGUs, “Air transport” and “Multiplus coalition 
and loyalty program”, until December 31, 2018. After the merger of Multiplus (see Note 1), 
administrator of the Multiplus coalition and loyalty program, the Company has determined air 
transport as a single CGU. The classification of intangible assets of indefinite useful life in the 
CGUs, before and after the merger of Multiplus S.A. are as follow:

Loyalty program  263,806 - - 274,420  
 
Management’s value -in-use calculations included significant judgments and assumptions relating to 
revenue growth rates , exchange rates, discount rate , inflation rates, fuel price . The estimation of 
these assumptions requ ires significant judgment by the management, as these variables feature 
inherent uncertainty; however, the assumptions used are consistent with Company’s internal 
planning. Therefore, management evaluates and updates the estimates on an annual basis, in li ght of 
conditions that affect these variables. The main assumptions used as well as the corresponding 
sensitivity analyses are showed in Note 16.  
 
(b)  Useful life, residual value, and impairment of property, plant, and equipment  
 
The depreciation of asset s is calculated based on the linear model, except for certain technical 
components depreciated on cycles and hours flown. These useful lives are reviewed on an annual 
basis according with the Company’s future economic benefits associated with them.  
 
Chang es in circumstances such as: technological advances, business model, planned use of assets or 
capital strategy may render the useful life different to the lifespan estimated. When it is determined 
that the useful life of property, plant, and equipment must  be reduced, as may occur in line with 
changes in planned usage of assets, the difference between the net book value and estimated 
recoverable value is depreciated, in accordance with the revised remaining useful life.  
Residual values are estimated in acc ordance with the market value that these assets will have at the 
end of their useful life. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, once a year. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its re coverable 
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its  estimated recoverable amount (N ote 2.8).  
 
(c)  Recoverability of deferred tax assets  
 
Management records d eferred taxes on the temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets  and liabilities and their carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. 
Deferred tax assets  are recognized only to the extent it is probable that the future taxable profit will 
be available against which  the temporary differences c an be utilized.

 Management applied significant judgment in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets. In 
determining  the amount  of deferred tax assets  to be recognized , management considered  historical 
profitability, projected future taxable profit (including assumptions related the revenue growth 
rates, exchange rate s, discount rate  and fuel price  which are in line with tho se used in the 
impairment analy sis of the group's cash generating unit ) and the expected timing of the reversals of 
existin g temporary differences . 
 
As of December 31 , 201 9, the Company has recognized deferred tax assets of ThUS$ 235,583  
(ThUS$ 273,529 as of December 31, 201 8) and has ceased to recognize deferr ed tax assets on tax 
losses of ThUS$ 110,933  (ThUS$ 137,761 D ecembe r 31, 201 8) (Note 18).  
 
(d)  Air tickets sold that will not be finally used.  
 
The Company records the anticipated sale of air tickets as deferred income. Ordinary income from 
the sale of tickets is recognized in the income statement when the passenger tran sport service is 
provided or expired for non -use. The Company evaluates monthly the probability of expiration of 
air tickets, with return clauses, based on the history of use of air tickets. A change in this 
probability could generate an impact on revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in 
future years. As of December 31, 2019 the deferred income associated with the air tickets sold 
amounts to  ThUS  $ 1,511,991. - (ThUS $ 1,299,304 as of December 31, 2018). A hypothetical 
change of one percentage point in passenger behavior with respect to use would result in an impact 
of up to  ThUS  $ 6,000 per month.  
 
(e)    Valuation of miles and points awarded to holders of loyalty programs, pending use.  
 
As of December 31, 2019, the deferred income associated w ith the LATAM Pass loy alty program 
amounts to ThUS$ 1,332,173 (ThUS $ 1,324,635 as of December 31, 2018). A hypothetical change 
of one percentage point in the probability of exchange  of miles  would result in an impact of ThUS $ 
31,565 in the results of 2019 (ThUS $ 27,726 in 2018). Deferred income associated with the 
LATAM Pass Brasil loyalty progra m (See Note 22) amounts to ThUS $ 354,84 7 as of December 
31, 2019 (ThUS $ 293,831 as of December 31, 2018). A hypothetical change of two percentage 
points in the probability of  exchange of points wo uld result in an impact of ThUS $ 12,5 01 in the 
results of 2019 (ThUS $ 13,140 in 2018).  
 
Management use d statistical models to estimate the miles and point awarded that will not be 
redeemed , by the programs members (breakage)  which involved significant judgments and 
assumptions relating the historical redemption and expiration activity and forecasted redemption 
and expiration patterns.  
 
For LATAM Pass Brazil, the expiration occurs after a fixed period from the time of the 
accumulation. Model is built by the management considering historical expiration rates, to 
costumers exchange behaviors and relevant segmentations.  
 
For LATAM Pass there are rules that allow member s to renew their miles, so the management  in 
conjunction with a n external specialist develop a predictive model of non -use miles, which allows 
to generate non -use rates on the basis of historical information, based on behavior of the  
accumulation, use and expiration of the miles. 
 43 
 
  (f)  Provisions needs, an d their va luation when required  
 
Known contingencies are recognized when: The Company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. The Company applies professional 
judgment, experience, and knowledge to use available information to determine these values, in 
light of the specific characteristics of known risks. This process facilitates the early assessment and  
valuation of potential risks in individual cases or in the development of contingent eventualities.  
 
(g)  Leases  
 
(i) Discount rate  
 
The discount rate used to calculate the lease debt corresponds, for each aircraft, to the implicit 
interest rate induced b y the contractual elements and residual market values. The implied rate of the 
contract is the discount rate that gives the aggregated present value of the minimum lease payments 
and the unguaranteed residual value. This present value should be equal to th e sum of the fair value 
of the leased asset and any initial direct costs of the lessor.  
 
For those lease s other than aircraft , we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is 
derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present 
value of lease payments. We consider to our recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data 
for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates.   
 
A 100 basis point decrease in our estimate of the rate at January 1, 2019 (the date the adoption of 
the standard) would increase our lease liability by approximately US$ 10 5 million.  
 
(ii) Lease term  
 
In determining the lease term, there are considers all facts and circumstances that creat e an 
economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension 
options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is 
reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated ). The assessment is reviewed if a significant 
event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is 
within the control of the lessee . 
 
(h) Investment in subsidiary (TAM)  
 
The management has applied its judgment in  determining that LATAM Airlines Group S.A. 
controls TAM S.A. and Subsidiaries, for accounting purposes, and has therefore consolidated the 
financial statements.  
 
The grounds for this decision are that LATAM issued ordinary shares in exchange for the major ity 
of circulating ordinary and preferential shares in TAM, except for those TAM shareholders who did 
not accept the exchange, which were subject to a squeeze out, entitling LATAM to substantially all 
economic benefits generated by the LATAM Group, and thu s exposing it to substantially all risks 
relating to the operations of TAM. This exchange aligns the economic interests of LATAM and all 
of its shareholders, including the controlling shareholders of TAM, thus ensuring that the 
shareholders and directors o f TAM shall have no incentive to exercise their rights in a manner that 
would be beneficial to TAM but detrimental to LATAM. Furthermore, all significant actions

 necessary of the operation of the airlines require votes in favor by the controlling sharehold ers of 
both LATAM and TAM.  
 
Since the integration of LAN and TAM operations, the most critical airline operations in Brazil 
have been managed by the CEO of TAM while global activities have been managed by the CEO of 
LATAM, who is in charge of the operation  of the LATAM Group as a whole and reports to the 
LATAM Board.  
 
The CEO of LATAM also evaluates the performance of LATAM Group executives and, together 
with the LATAM Board, determines compensation. Although Brazilian law currently imposes 
restrictions on  the percentages of voting rights that may be held by foreign investors, LATAM 
believes that the economic basis of these agreements meets the requirements of accounting 
standards in force, and that the consolidation of the operations of LAN and LATAM is ap propriate.  
 
These estimates were made based on the best information available relating to the matters analyzed.  
 
In any case, it is possible that events that may take place in the future could lead to their 
modification in future reporting periods, which would be made in a prospective manner. 
 
NOTE 5 - SEGMENTAL INFORMATION  
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company considers that it has a single operating segment, that of Air 
Transport. This segment corresponds to the rou te network for air transport and is based on the way 
in which the business is managed, according to the centralized nature of its operations, the ability to 
open and close routes, as well as reassignment (airplanes, crew, personnel, etc.) within the networ k, 
which implies a functional interrelation between all of them, making them inseparable.  This 
segment definition is one of the most common worldwide in the airline industry . 
 
Until June 2019, the Company presented two operating segments, the one correspon ding to Air 
transport and the Multiplus coalition and loyalty program segment, discussed in  Note 1 , the 
Company Multiplus S.A. Administrator of the Coalition and Loyalty Program Multiplus merged 
into TAM Linhas Aereas S.A., ceasing to be an entity with ind ependent administration. The 
Multiplus coalition and Loyalty program, which was defined as an operating segment, due to this 
independent administration, bec ame part of the Air Transport segment together with the LATAM 
Pass and LATAM fidelidades  programs.  
 
The company has restated the information corresponding to December 31, 2018  for the presentation 
of a single segment of information.  45

control.  
The historical and current renegotiations are not very relevant , and the policy is to analyze case by 
case to classify them according to the existence of risk, determining if their reclassification 
corresponds to pre -judicial collection accounts.

(2) Aircraft maintenance reserves reflect prepayment deposits made by the group to lessors of 
certain aircraft under operating lease agreements in order to ensure that funds are available to 
suppo rt the scheduled heavy maintenance of the aircraft.  
 
These amounts are calculated based on performance measures, such as flight hours or cycles, are 
paid periodically (usually monthly) and are contractually required to be repaid to the lessee upon 
the com pletion of the required maintenance of the leased aircraft. At the end of the lease term, any 
unused maintenance reserves are either returned to the Company in cash or used to offset amounts 
that we may owe the lessor as a maintenance adjustment.  
 
In some cases,  (five lease agreements), if the maintenance cost incurred by LATAM is less than the 
corresponding maintenance reserves, the lessor is entitled to retain those excess amounts at the time 
the heavy maintenance is performed. The Company periodically re views its maintenance reserves 57 
 
 for each of its leased aircraft to ens ure that they will be recovered  and recognizes an expense if any 
such amounts are less than probable of being returned. The cost of aircraft maintenance in the last 
years has been higher than the related maintenance reserves for all aircraft.  
 
As of December 31 , 2019 , main tenance reserves amount to ThUS $ 45,831 (ThUS$ 52,667 as of 
December 31, 2018 ), cor responding to 8  aircraft that maintain remaining balances, which will be 
settled in the  next maintenance or return.  
 
Aircraft maintenance reserves are classified as current or non -current depending on the dates when 
the related maintenance is expect ed to be performed (Note 2.23) .

As of December 31, 2019, the Company maint ains only the CGU “Air Transport”, due to the 
merger of Multiplus S.A. in TAM Linhas Aereas (see Note 1), and changes in the management 
structure.  
 
The CGU “Air transport” considers the transport of passengers and cargo, both in the domestic 
markets of Chi le, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil, as well as in a series of regional 
and international routes in America, Europe and Oceania.  
 
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on the value in use calculations 
which require the u se of assumptions. These calculations use cash flow projections covering a  5 
year period which is  based on the financial budgets approved by management. Cash flows beyond 
the 5 year period are extrapolated using the estimated revenue growth rates and ave rage volumes, 
which do not exceed the average long -term revenue growth rates. 
 
Management’s cash flow projections included significant judgements and assumptions related to 
annual revenue growth rates, discount rate, inflation rates, the exchange rate and price of fuel. The 
annual revenue growth rate is based on past performance and management’s expectations of market 
development in each of the countries in which it operates. The discount rates used, for the CGU 
"Air transport", are in determined in US doll ars, after taxes, and reflect specific risks related to the 
relevant countries of each of the operations. Inflation rates and exchange rates are based on the data 
available from the countries and the information provided by the Central Bank of the various 
countries where it operates, and the price of fuel is determined based on estimated levels of 
production, the competitive environment of the market in which they operat e and their commercial 
strategy .

 As of December 31, 201 9 the recoverable values were  determined using the following assumptions 
presented below:  
 
Exchange rate (1)
Discount rate based on the weighted average 
  cost of capital (WACC)
Fuel Price from futures price curves

The result of the impairment test, which includes a sensitivity analysis of its main variables, showed 
that the estimated recoverable amount exceede d the carrying amount of the  cash generating unit, 
and therefore no i mpairment was detected. 
 
The calculation of the recoverable value of the CGU is most sensitive to annual revenue growth 
rates, discount and exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis included the individual impact of the 
variations of the critical estimates when determining the recoverable amounts, namely:

NOTE 1 8 - CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES  
 
In the period  ended December 31 , 2019 , the income tax provision was calculated for such period, 
applying  the partially integrated taxation system and a rate of 2 7%, in accordance with the Law No. 
20,780 published in the Official Journal of the Republic o f Chile on September 29, 2014.  
Deferred taxes are recognized, on the temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.  
No deferred tax has been recorded for permanent difference, since they are caused by transactions 
that are recorded in the financial statements and that will not have impact on income taxes.

(1) Covers the s ignificant variations in cash flows associated with market risk implicit in the 
changes in the 3 -month LIBOR interest rate and the exchange rate US$/UF of bank loans. 
These contracts are recorded as cash flow hedges and fair value.  
 
(2) Covers the significant  variations in cash flows associated with market risk implicit in the 
increases in the 3 months LIBOR interest rates for long -term loans incurred in the acquisition 
of aircraft and bank loans. These contracts are recorded as cash flow hedges.  
 
(3) Covers sign ificant variations in cash flows associated with market risk implicit in the changes 
in the price of future fuel purchases. These contracts are recorde d as cash flow hedges.  
 
(4) They cover the exposure to foreign exchange risk of operating cash flows, mainly caused by 
the fluctuation of the CLP/US$, R$/US$, US$/EUR and US$/GBP exchange rate. These 
contracts are registered as cash flow hedge contracts.  
  
During the periods presented, the Company only has cash flow and fair value hedges (in the case of 
CCS). In the case of fuel hedges, the cash flows subject to such hedges will occur and will impact 
results in the next 12 months from the date of the consolidated statement of financial position, 
while in the case of hedges of interest rates, these they will occur and will impact results throughout 
the life of the associated loans, up to their maturity. In the case of currency hedges through a CCS, 
there is a group of hedging relationships, in which two types of hedge accounting are generated, 
one of cash flow for t he US $ / UF component; and another of fair value, for the floating rate

 component US $. The other group of hedging relationships only generates cash flow hedge 
accounting for the US $ / UF component.  
All hedging operations have been performed for highly p robable transactions.  
 
Since none of the coverage resulted in the recognition of a non -financial asset, no portion of the 
result of the derivatives recognized in equity was transferred to the initial value of such assets.  
The amounts recognized in comprehe nsive income during the period and transferred from net

(1)   Cumulative balances include judicial deposit delive red as security, with respect to t he "Aerovía 
Fundo" (FA), for US $ 88 million, made in order to suspend the application of the tax credit. 
The Company is discussing in the Court the constitutionality of the requirement made by FA in 
a lawsuit. Initially it  was covered by the effects of a precautionary measure, this means that the 
Company would not be obliged to collect the tax, as long as there is no judicial decision in this 
regard. However, the decision taken by the judge in the first instance was publish ed 
unfavorably, revoking the injunction. As the lawsuit is still underway (TAM appealed this first 
decision), the Company needed to make the judicial deposit, for the suspension of the 
enforceability of the tax credit; deposit that was classified in this i tem, discounting the existing 
provision for this purpose. Finally, if the final decision is favorable to the Company, the 
deposit made will return to TAM. On the other hand, if the court confirms the first decision, 
said deposit will become a final payment  in favor of the Government of Brazil. The procedural 
stage as of December 31 , 2019  is described in Note 31 in the Role of the case 
2001.51.01.012530- 0.

among which is Lan Cargo SA, which forms part of the global investigation initiated in 2006 
for possible infractions of free competition in the air cargo market, which was carried out 
jointly by the European and United States authorities.  
 
With respect to Europe, the General Directorate of Competition imposed fines totaling                               
€ 799,445,000 (seven hundred and ninety -nine million four hundred and forty -five thousand

(f.1) Currency translation re serve  
 
These originate from exchange differences arising from the translation of any investment in foreign 
entities (or Chilean investment with a functional currency different to that of the parent), and from 
loans and other instruments in foreign currency  designated as hedges for such investments. When 
the investment (all or part) is sold or disposed and loss of control occurs, these reserves are shown 
in the consolidated statement of income as part of the loss or gain on the sale or disposal. If the sale 
does not involve loss of control, these reserves are transferred to non -controlling interests.

free competition of cargo airlines, 
especially fuel surcharge. On December 
26, 2007, the General Directorate for  
Competition of the European Commission 
notified Lan Cargo S.A. and LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. the instruction 
process against twenty  five cargo airlines, 
including Lan Cargo S.A., for alleged 
breaches of competition in the air cargo 
market in Europe, especially the alleged 
fixed fuel surcharge and freight.    On April 14, 2008, the notification of the European 
Commission was  replied. The appeal was filed on               
January 24, 2011.  
On May 11, 2015, we attended a hearing at which we 
petitioned for the vacation of the Decision based on 
discrepancies in the Decision between the operating 
section, which mentions four infringements (d epending 
on the routes involved) but refers to Lan in only one of 
those four routes; and the ruling section (which mentions 
one single conjoint infraction).  
On November 9, 2010, the General Directorate for 
Competition of the European Commission notified L an 
Cargo S.A. and LATAM Airlines Group S.A. the 
imposition of a fine in the amount of THUS$ 9,217 
(8,220, 000 Euros)  
This fine is being appealed by Lan Cargo S.A. and 
LATAM Airlines Group S.A.  On December 16, 2015, 
the European Court of Justice revoked the  Commission’s 
decision because of discrepancies. The European 
Commission did not appeal the decision, but presented a 
new one on March 17, 2017 reiterating the imposition of 
the same fine on the eleven original airlines.  The fine 
totals 776,465,000 Euros.   It imposed the same fine as 
before on Lan Cargo and its parent, LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A., totaling 8 .2 million Euros. On May 31, 2017 
Lan Cargo S.A. and LATAM Airlines Group S.A. filed a 
petition with the General Court of the European Union 
seeking vaca tion of this decision. We presented our 
defense in December 2017. On July 12, 2019, we 
attended a hearing before the European Court of Justice 
to confirm our petition for vacation of judgment or 
otherwise, a reduction in the amount of the fine.  
LATAM AIRL INES GROUP, S.A. expects that the 
ruling by the General Court of the European Union may 
reduce the amount of this fine.

 Colombia. This case is being heard by the 45th Civil Court of 
the Bogota Circuit in Colombia.  Statements were taken from 
witnesses presented by REGIONAL ONE and VAS on October 
31, 2018.  The court received the expert opinions requested by 
REGIONAL ONE and VAS and g iven their petition, it asked 
the experts to expand upon their opinions. It also changed the 
experts requested by LATAM AIRLINES COLOMBIA. The 
case was brought before the Court on September 10, 2018 and 
these rulings are pending processing so that a new he aring can 
be scheduled. On October 31, 2018, the judge postponed the 
deadline for the parties to answer the objection because of a 
serious error brought to light by VAS regarding the translation 
submitted by the expert. The process has been in the judge’s 
chambers since March 11, 2019 to decide on replacing the 
damage estimation expert as requested by LATAM AIRLINES 
COLOMBIA.  The one previously appointed did not take 
office.  A petition has also been made by VAS objecting to the 
translation of the document s in English into Spanish due to 
serious mistakes, which was served to the parties in October 
2018. The 45th Civil Circuit Court issued an order on August 
13, 2019 that did not decide on the pending matters but rather 
voided all actions since September 14,  2018 and ordered the 
case to be referred to the 46th Civil Circuit Court according to 
article 121 of the General Code of Procedure.  Said article says 
that court decisions must be rendered in no more than one (1) 
year as from the service of the court orde r admitting the claim.  
If that period expires without any ruling being issued, the Judge 
will automatically forfeit competence over the proceedings and 
must give the Administrative Room of the Superior Council of 
the Judiciary notice of that fact the next  day, in addition to 
referring the case file to the next sitting judge in line, who will 
have competence and will issue a ruling in no more than 6 
months.  The case was sent to the 46th Civil Circuit Court on 
September 4, 2019, which claims that there was a competence 
conflict and then sent the case to the Superior Court of Bogotá 
to decide which court, the 45th or 46th, had to continue with 
the case. 
Florida. On June 4, 2019, the State Court of Florida allowed 
REGIONAL ONE to add a new claim against LATAM 
AIRLINES COLOMBIA for default on a verbal contract.  
Given the new claim, LATAM AIRLINES COLOMBIA 
petitioned that the Court postpone the trial to August 2019 to 
have the time to investigate the facts alleged by REGIONAL 
ONE to prove a verbal contract.  The  State Court granted the 
postponement of a jury trial to June 2020.  In the meantime, the 
discovery stage continues, including verbal statements by 
experts on behalf of both parties.  There may be some change 
in the committed amount, which will be reported  in due course.  12,443

LATAM

Santiago  C-29.945 -2016  The Company received notice of a civil liability 
claim by Inversiones Ranco Tres S.A. on January 
18, 2017.  It is represented by Mr. Jorge Enrique 
Said Yarur.  It was filed against LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A. for an alleged contr actual default by 
the Company and against Ramon Eblen Kadiz, 
Jorge Awad Mehech, Juan Jose Cueto Plaza, 
Enrique Cueto Plaza and Ignacio Cueto Plaza, 
directors and officers, for alleged breaches of their 
duties.  In the case of Juan Jose Cueto Plaza, 
Enrique Cueto Plaza and Ignacio Cueto Plaza, it 
alleges a breach, as controllers of the Company, of 
their duties under the incorporation agreement.  
LATAM has retained legal counsel specializing in 
this area to defend it.  The claim was answered on March 22, 2017 and the plaintiff filed its 
replication on April 4, 2017.  LATAM filed its rejoinder on April 13, 
2017, which concluded the argument stage of the lawsuit.  A 
reconciliation hearing was held on May 2, 2017, but the parties did 
not reach an agreement.   The Court issued the evidentiary decree on 
May 12, 2017.  We filed a petition for reconsideration because we 
disagreed with certain points of evidence.  That petition was partially 
sustained by the Court on June 27, 2017.  The evidentiary stage 
commenced and t hen concluded on July 20, 2017.  Observations to 
the evidence must now be presented.  That period expires August 1, 
2017.  We filed our observations to the evidence on August 1, 2017.  
We were served the decision on December 13, 2017 that dismissed 
the cla im since LATAM was in no way liable.  The plaintiff filed an 
appeal on December 26, 2017.  Arguments were pled before the 
Santiago Court of Appeals on April 23, 2019, and on April 30, 2019, 
this Court confirmed the ruling of the trial court absolving LATAM .  
The losing party was ordered to pay costs in both cases. On May 18, 
2019, Inversiones Ranco Tres S.A. filed a remedy of vacation of 
judgment based on technicalities and on substance against the 
Appellate Court decision.  The Appellate Court admitted bot h 
appeals on May 29, 2019 and the appeals are pending a hearing by

to Paragraph 86 of IAS 37 Provisions, Co ntingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.  
 
II. Governmental Investigations.  
 
1) On July 25, 2016, LATAM reached agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice  
(“DOJ”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  (“SEC”) regarding the investigation of 
paymen ts for US$1,150,000 by Lan Airlines S.A. in 2006 -2007 to a consultant advising it in the 
resolution of labor matters in Argentina.   
 
The purpose of the investigation was to determine whether these payments violated the U.S. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( “FCPA”) that: (i) forbids bribery of foreign government authorities 
in order to obtain a commercial advantage; and (ii) requires the companies that must abide by the 
FCPA to keep appropriate accounting records and implant an adequate internal control syste m.  The 
FCPA is applicable to LATAM because of its ADR program in effect on the U.S. securities market.  
 
After an exhaustive investigation, the DOJ and SEC concluded that there was no violation of the 
bribery provisions of the FCPA, which is consistent wit h the results of LATAM’s internal 
investigation.  However, the DOJ and SEC consider that LATAM accounted for these payments 
incorrectly and, consequently, infringed the part of the FCPA requiring companies to keep accurate 
accounting records.  These author ities also consider that LATAM’s internal controls in 2006 -2007 
were weak, so LATAM would have also violated the provisions in the FCPA requiring it to 
maintain an adequate internal control system.  
 
The agreements signed, included the following:  
 
(a) The agree ment with the DOJ involves: (i) entering into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
(“DPA”), which is a public contract under which the DOJ files public charges alleging an 
infringement of the FCPA accounting regulations.  LATAM is not obligated to answer these  
charges, the DOJ will not pursue them for a period of 3 years, and the DOJ will dismiss the charges 
after expiration of that 3 -year period provided LATAM complies with all terms of the DPA. In 
exchange, LATAM must admit to the negotiated events described in the DPA and agree to pay the 
negotiated fine explained below and abide by other terms stipulated in the agreement; (ii) clauses in 
which LATAM admits that the payments to the consultant in Argentina were incorrectly accounted 
for and that at the time th ose payments were made (2006 -2007), it did not have adequate internal 
controls in place; (iii) LATAM’s agreement to have an outside consultant monitor, evaluate and 
report to the DOJ on the effectiveness of LATAM’s compliance program for a period of 27 mon ths; 
and LATAM’s agreement to continue evaluating and reporting directly to the DOJ on the 118 
 effectiveness of its compliance program for a period of 9 months after the consultant’s work 
concludes; and (iv) LATAM paid a fine of ThUS$12,750. 
 
(b) The agreement wit h the SEC involves: (i) accepting a Cease and Desist Order, which is an 
administrative resolution of the SEC closing the investigation, in which LATAM will accept certain 
obligations and statements of fact that are described in the document; (ii) accepting  the same 
obligations regarding the consultant mentioned above; and (iii) LATAM paid a fine of           
ThUS$ 6,744 and interest of ThUS$ 2,694.  
 
On May 15, 2019, the external consultant certified that the Anticorruption program of LATAM 
Airlines Group S. A. It is reasonably designed and implemented to prevent and detect violations 
within LATAM to anti -corruption laws.  
 
On July 23, 2019, the DOJ approved the certification made by the consultant on May 15, 2019 
regarding the Anticorruption program of LATAM A irlines Group S.A.  
 
On January 31, 2020, the Florida Court sustained the DOJ’s motion to withdraw the criminal action 
filed against LATAM Airlines Group S.A. as LATAM had fulfilled all the conditions in the DPA.  
So, the DOJ case is closed.  
 
2) On April 6,  2019, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. received notification of the resolution issued by 
the National Economic Prosecutor's Office (FNE), which begins an investigation into the LATAM 
Pass frequent passenger program. The last move in the cause Role No. 2530 -19 le ading this 
investigation corresponds to LATAM Airlines Group S.A.  response in May 2019.  
 
3) On July 9, 2019, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. received the resolution issued by the National 
Economic Prosecutor's Office (FNE), which begins an investigation into the  Alliance Agreement 
between LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and American Airlines INC. The last move in the cause 
Role No. 2565- 19 leading this investigation corresponds to a statement on September 11, 2019  
 
4) On July 26, 2019, the National Consumer Service of Chile (SERNAC) issued the Ordinary 
Resolution No. 12,711 which proposed to initiate a collective voluntary mediation procedure on 
effectively informing passengers of their rights in cases of cancellation of flights or no show to 
boarding, as well as the ob ligation to return the respective boarding fees as provided by art. 133 C 
of the Aeronautical Code. The Company has voluntarily decided to participate in this procedure, 
the terms and conditions of which are being negotiated.  
 
5) On October 15, 2019, LATAM  Airlines Group S.A. received the resolution issued by the 
National Economic Prosecuting Authority (FNE) advising of the start of an investigation into the 
agreement between LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Delta Airlines, Inc. (Case number 2585 -19). 
The Company is cooperating in this investigation.  
 
6) On December 11 , 2019, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. received Office No. 122019 / FFD / 
208993 by the  Fiscalía Regional Metropolitana Centro Norte, requesting information on statements 
that appeared in the press in  Brazil about alleged payments to public officials within the framework

 NOTE 32 – COMMITMENTS   
 
(a)  Loan covenant s 
 
The Company and its subsidiaries do not maintain credit agreements that set limits on certain 
financial indicators of the Company or its subsidiaries, with the exception of those detailed below:  
 
With respect to the various contrac ts concluded by the Company for the financing of Boeing 787 
aircraft that have the guarantee of the Export - Import Bank of the United States of America, limits 
have been established for some financial indicators of the parent company on a consolidated bas is, 
in respect of which, in any case, non -compliance does not accelerate payment of the loan . 
 
The established limits measured semiannually on the basis of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
are the following:  
 
I. Debt to EBITDAR: The ratio of the Company' s financial obligations, on a consolidated 
basis, to EBITDAR must not exceed 6 times.  
 
EBITDAR: It is defined as the net result, excluding interest, depreciation, amortization, 
rental income and profits or extraordinary losses not related to ordinary cours e of business . 
 
II. Fixed charge index: EBITDAR of the last twelve months on the sum of the cash on a 
consolidated basis required to cover interest expenses during said period, plus lease rental 
expenses, plus dividends declared or paid by the Company. This in dex should not be less 
than 1.2 times.  
 
III. Minimum liquidity: The cash and cash equivalent of the Consolidated Company must not 
be less than ThUS $ 75,000.  
 
Regarding the renewable credit line of credit (“Revolving Credit Facility”) established with a 
consort ium of twelve banks led by Citibank, with a guarantee of airplanes, engines, spare parts and 
supplies for a total amount available of US $ 600 million, this includes restrictions of minimum 
liquidity, measured at the level of the Consolidated Company (with  a minimum level of US $ 750 
million) and measured at the individual level for LATAM Airlines Group SA and TAM Linhas 
Aéreas S.A. (with a minimum level of US $ 400 million). Compliance with these restrictions is a 
precondition for using the line; If the li ne is used, these restrictions must be reported quarterly, and 
failure to comply with these restrictions results acceleration of loan payment . As of December 31, 
2019, this line of credit is not used.  
 
As of December 31 , 2019 this line of credit establishe d with a consortium of twelve  banks led by 
Citibank, is not used.  
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company is in compliance with all the financial indicators detailed 
above.  
 
On the other hand, the Company's financing contracts generally establish clauses rel ated to changes 
in the ownership structure and in the controller and disposition of the assets  (as regards mainly to 
important transfers of assets) . 120 
 In particular, the contract "Indenture" signed between Guanay Finance Limited (see Note 1), 
LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Citibank, N.A. on November 7, 2013, it includes clauses related 
to changes in the ownership structure and Company controller, which generate the anticipation  of 
certain payment obligations. As result of the acquisition of 20% of the shares o f LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A. by Delta Air Lines, Inc., the debt held by Guanay Finance Limited, which mature  in 
December 2020, will be paid in March 2020, this was considered by the Company.  
 
Finally, we Note that the particular terms of the aforementioned clauses regarding the Indenture 
contract are not included in any other financing contract that the Company maintains in force as of 
this date .

Comparative analysis and explanation 
of main trends:
1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT
At December 31, 2019, the Company’s assets 
totaled THUS$21,087,806 which, compared to 
the value at December 31, 2018, represents a 
THUS$1,009,084 decrease (4,8%).
The Company’s current assets increased by 
THUS$742,367 (22,7%), compared to yearend 
2018. The main increases were seen in the fol-
lowing segments: Sundry debtors and accounts 
receivables, current, for THUS$81,766 (7 .0%), Oth-
er financial assets, current, worth THUS$115,520 
(30.1%), Current inventories for THUS$74,888 
(26.8%), Other non-financial assets, current, for 
THUS$22,973 (7 .9%), and Non-current assets or 
groups of assets classified as held for sale or held for distribution to owners for THUS$479,382. 
These line items we compensated by the de-
crease in: Cash and cash equivalents for 
THUS$9,063 (0.8%), and Current Tax Assets for 
THUS$39,813 (57 .6%)
The Company’s liquidity index showed an increase, 
going from 0.55 times at yearend 2018 to 0.58 
times at December 2019. Current assets increased 
22.7% while Current liabilities did so by 17 .3%. 
Moreover, we can see that the quick ratio de-
creased from 0.18 times at yearend 2018 to 0.15 
times at the yearend 2019.
The Company’s Non-current assets increased 
by THUS$266,717 (1.6%) vs. yearend 2018. The 
main increase was seen in the Property, plant, 
and equipment line item for THUS$417,809 
(3.3%), which translates mainly into the addi-
tions worth THUS$2,519,305, compensated by 
the spending from depreciation in 2019, totaling 
THUS$1,221,991 and the reclassification from 
this line item to non-current assets and groups 
in unlawful appropriation held for sale. Anoth-
er line item of Non-Current Assets with increas-
es is Intangible assets other than goodwill for 
THUS$7,169 (0.5%), among other movements in 
the year. The remaining line items of Non-Current 
Assets decreased in the year.
Moreover, the assets reflect the effects of the 
adoption of IFRS 16, worth BN US$2.51.At December 31, 2019, the Company’s liabilities 
totaled THUS$17,958,629 which, compared to 
the value as at December 31, 2018, represents a 
THUS$1,320,508 increase, equivalent to 7 .9%.
The Company’s current liabilities increased by 
THUS$1,028,693 (17 .3%), compared to yearend 
2018. The main increases were seen in the follow-
ing line items: Other financial liabilities, current, 
for THUS$91,374 (5.1%), Trade accounts payable 
and other payables for THUS$548,571 (32.8%), 
and Other non-financial liabilities, current, for 
THUS$380,475 (15.5%).
The indebtedness indicator of the Company’s Current 
Liabilities increased 2.22% vs. yearend 2018. The im-
pact of current Liabilities on total debt increased by 
3.11 percentage points, from 35.65% at yearend 2018 
to 38.76% at the end of the current period.
 The Company’s non-current Liabilities increased 
by THUS$291,815 (2.7%), compared to the sum 
reached by December 31, 2018. The main increases 
were seen in the following line items: Other financial 
liabilities, non-current, for THUS$170,956 (2.0%), 
Accounts payable, non-current, for THUS$89,833 
(17 .0%), and Other non-financial liabilities, non-cur -
rent, for US$206,681 (32.1%). This was compensat -
ed by a decrease in Liabilities from deferred tax -
es, totaling THUS$169,768 (21.6%), among other 
movements in the year.
The Company’s non-current Liabilities’ indebtedness 
indicator shows a 10.0% increase from 3.19 times at 
December 31, 2018, to 3.51 times at December 31, 
2019. The impact of non-current Liabilities on total 
debt decreased by 3.1 percentage points from 64.35% 
at yearend 2018 to 61.24% at December 2019.
The Company’s liabilities were affected by the ef -
fects of the adoption of IFRS 16, which were incor -
porated recognizing THUS$2,818.
The indicator of the Company’s total indebtedness 
over Equity increased by 16.0% from 4.95 times at 
yearend 2018 to 5.74 times at the end of the cur -
rent period.
At December 31, 2019, roughly 62% of the debt has 
a fixed rate or is linked to one of the financial hedg-
ing instruments arranged. The average rate on the 
debt is 4.63%.

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  CreditsThe Equity attributable to the controlling share-
holders decreased by THUS$229,911, from 
THUS$3,360,693 at December 31, 2018 to 
THUS$3,130,782 at December 31, 2019. 
The decrease was seen in: Other reserves for 
THUS$363,212, mainly resulting from: the negative 
effect of the variation in Reserves from differenc -
es in currency translation for THUS$233,643, and 
in the Transactions with minority holders, explained 
by the loss resulting from the acquisition of the mi-
nority stake in Multiplus S.A. for THUS$(184,135), 
compensated by the increase in the accrued result, 
from the net effect between: the result of the year 
2019, attributable to the controlling shareholders, 
corresponding to a profit of THUS$190,430; and 
the provision on the results of the year 2019 corre-
sponding to 30% of the mandatory minimum divi-
dends, worth THUS$57,129.
The effect of the adoption of IFRS 16 on the equity 
was a decrease of MMUS$306.2. CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT
At December 31, 2019, the controlling company 
reported a THUS$190,430 gain, translating into a 
THUS$119,381 change in income vs. the previous 
year’s THUS$309,811. Net margin decreased from 
3.0% to 1.8% during 2019.
The operating income for the year 2019 amounts 
to THUS$741,602 million which, compared to 2018, 
shows a THUS$145,382 decrease, equivalent to 
16.4%, whereas the operating margin settled at 
7 .1%, showing a 1.5 percentage-point decline.
Operating income at December 31, 2019, in-
creased 0.6% vs. the same period of 2018, totaling 
THUS$10,430,927 .This was due to a 3.4% increase 
in passenger revenues, largely countered by a 10.3% 
drop in Cargo revenues, and a 2.37% decrease in 
Other income. The effect of the Brazilian real’s de-
preciation represents lower ordinary revenues worth 
around US$225 million.
PAX revenues totaled THUS$9,005,629 billion 
which, compared to the THUS$8,708,988 from 
the twelve months of 2018, translates into a 
3.4% increase. This change is mainly due to the 
4.1% increase in capacity measured in ASK. This 
is compensated by a 0.6% decrease in RASK as a 
result of the 1.1.% reduction in yields, which were 
affected by the worst macroeconomic scenar -
io in South America and by the depreciation and 
volatility of local currencies (especially the Brazil-ian real, and the Chilean and Argentinean peso). 
Moreover, the load factor reached 83.5%, in 2019, 
translating into a 0.4 percentage-point increase 
from the previous year.
At December 31, 2019, Cargo revenues reached 
THUS$1,064,434, translating into a 10.3% de-
crease vs. 2018. This lower income answers to an 
8.8% drop in the yields and a 1.6% decline in traf -
fic measured in RTK. The yield decrease reflects 
a weakening in the markets, particularly in Brazil 
and Argentina; in addition, exports in Chile were 
affected as a result of the social events that took 
place in the last quarter of 2019. On the other 
hand, the sale of Mexican affiliate MasAir during 
the last quarter of 2018 reduced revenues by 
around US$37 million during 2019 compared to 
2018; moreover, capacity measured in ATK de-
creased by 2.2%.
The Other revenues item shows a THUS$111,894 
decrease, mainly due to the acquisition and sub-
sequent merger of Multiplus and TAM Linhas Aer -
eas S.A.; on the other hand, the first quarter of 
2018 witnessed gains from the sale of aircrafts.At December 31, 2019, Operating costs totaled 
THUS$9,689,325 which, compared to 2018, trans-
late into higher costs by THUS$208,095, equiva-
lent to a 2.2% increase, whereas unit cost per ASK 
decreased by 1.8%. Furthermore, the effect of the 
Brazilian Real’s depreciation on this line item trans-
lates into lower costs by roughly US$185 million. 
Item variations are explained as follows:
a)  Compensations and benefits decreased by 
THUS$25,207, mainly due to the depreciation of 
local currencies, (particularly the Brazilian real, 
and the Chilean and Argentinean peso), partly 
countered by an average increase in the number 
of flight crew during the year.
b)  Fuel decreased by 1.8%, equivalent to 
THUS$54,020.This drop is mainly the result of a 
9.1% reduction in unhedged prices, partly coun-
tered by a 5.6% increase in consumption mea-
sured in gallons. The Company recognized a loss 
of THUS$23,110 in 2019 due to fuel hedges, 
compared to a THUS$28,993 gain in 2018.
c)  Fees show a THUS$622 decrease, mainly due 
to the drop in cargo sales and adjustments in 
the percentages of sales agents’ commissions, 
compensated by a 7 .8% increase in the num-
ber of passengers transported and greater sales 
through agencies in the corporate passenger 
market. Both effects combined translate into a 
0.3% drop in costs in 2019 vs. 2018.

THUS$97,348 in 2019. This change is mainly 
explained by the fleet movements with the ad-
dition of 23 Airbus A320 family, 4 Airbus A350 
family, and 2 Boeing 787 airplanes.
e)  The Other Leases and Landing Fees rose by 
US$68,978, mostly due to an increase in pas-
sengers transported and greater costs related to 
Variable Handling operations.
f)  Passenger Services decreased by THUS$18,949, 
which translates into a 6.8% variation, mainly ex -
plained by lower costs from passenger compen-
sations and reimbursements paid during 2019.
g)  Maintenance reported higher costs by 
THUS$77,984, equivalent to a 21.3% increase, 
mainly resulting from a greater number of air -
planes in 2019.
h)  Other Operating Costs show a THUS$62,583 in-
crease, mainly due to tax recoveries in Brazil by 
the end of 2018.
Financial revenues totaled THUS$26,283 which, 
compared to the THUS$53,253 million in 2018, translates into lower income by THUS$26,970, 
mainly due to returns on Multiplus’ financial invest -
ments in 2018.
Financial costs increased 9.4%, totaling 
THUS$589,934 by December 2019. The variation is 
mainly the effect of higher costs from securitiza-
tion and bank interest expenses.
Other income/costs up to December 31, 2019, re-
ported a negative result of THUS$36,035 and a pos-
itive one of THUS$14,565 in 2018. Both years re-
flect currency exchange losses of US$33 and US$38 
million, respectively, which in 2018 was compensat -
ed by the revenues obtained from the sale of the 
Andes Airport Services and Mas Air affiliates.
The main line items in the Consolidated Financial 
Statement of TAM S.A. and Affiliates, which caused 
a THUS$53,620 currency exchange loss at Decem-
ber 31, 2019, are as follows: Other financial liabili-
ties; THUS$75 loss from USD-denominated loans 
and financial leasing for fleet acquisitions; net ac -
counts receivable and payable to related companies, 
totaling a loss of THUS$7,423, and net accounts re-
ceivable and payable to third parties, totaling a loss 
of THUS$39,399. The other net assets and liabilities 
line items generated a THUS$6,723 loss.3. ANAL YSIS AND EXPLANATION OF 
CONSOLIDATED NET CASH FLOW 
GENERATED BY OPERATION, INVESTMENT, 
AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES
Cash flow from Operation Activities as at De -
cember 31, 2019 shows a positive variation 
of THUS$753,351, compared to the same 
period a year earlier, mainly due to posi -
tive variations in: Cash receipts from the sale 
of goods and rendering of services totaling 
THUS$291,528, Other cash receipts from op -
eration activities totaling US$32,584; Suppli -
er payments for goods provided and Pay -
ments to and on behalf of employees, whose 
positive variations are the result of lower 
payments made, totaling THUS$111,129 and 
US$144,216, respectively; and Other cash in -
flows and outflows totaling THUS$201,674. 
The positive variations in the abovementioned 
concepts are compensated by negative varia -
tions in: Other payments from operation ac -
tivities totaling THUS$11.655 and reimburse -
ments of Income Taxes worth THUS$16,125.
The positive variation of THUS$201,674 in 
Other cash inflows and outflows, from Op -
erating Cash Flows, is the result of the net 
effect between: The compensation re -
ceived from Delta Air Lines Inc. total -
ing THUS$350,000; the increase in pay -
ments made on fuel derivatives totaling 
THUS$113,128, and the decrease in assur -
ances and others, totaling THUS$35,198.

variation of THUS$1,060,839 compared to the same 
period of the previous year. This variation is main-
ly explained by: the increase in Purchases of prop-
erty, plant, and equipment totaling THUS$615,914 
; the decrease in Sums from the sale of proper -
ty, plant, and equipment totaling THUS$173.431; 
the net effect on Other cash receipts and pay-
ments on the sale and purchase of equity or debt 
instruments from other companies, resulting from 
the increase in investments made in private Equi-
ty Funds totaling THUS$165,677, compared to the 
previous year; the increase in Purchases of intangi-
ble assets totaling THUS$43,967; the decrease in 
Cash flows from the loss of control of subsidiaries 
or other businesses totaling THUS$69,724, as there 
were no sales of affiliates during 2019, compared 
to the sale during 2018 of the following affiliates: 
Andes S.A. for US$39.10 million, Rampas Andes for 
THUS$1,150, and Mas Air for THUS$29.466. The 
negative changes described were compensated by 
the positive variation in Interest earned, totaling 
THUS$7,647, and other cash inflows or outflows 
worth THUS$227 .The Flow from Financing Activities showed a pos-
itive change of THUS$265,076 , compared to the 
same period of a year earlier, explained mainly by 
the positive variation in Sums from loans total-
ing THUS$802,666, and the decrease in dividends 
paid by THUS$17,504, corresponding to the net 
effect resulting from: The increase in dividends 
paid by LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Affiliates by 
THUS$8,525 and the THUS$26,029 million de-
crease as, during 2019, the affiliate Multiplus S.A. 
made no payments under this concept, given the 
purchase of the minority stake in this affiliate by 
TAM Linhas Aereas S.A. The purchase of the mi-
nority stake in Multiplus S.A. also led to an increase 
in Payments from changes in ownership in subsid-
iaries that do not result in a loss of control, totaling 
THUS$294,103 million, together with the increases 
in Payments on Loans and Payments on financial 
leasing liabilities by THUS$147,660, interest paid by 
THUS$10,574, and the decrease in Other cash in-
flows and outflows by THUS$102,757, compensat -
ed the positive variation in Cash Flow from Financ -
ing Activities.The flows from loans described above include the 
following events:
a)  On February 11, 2019, LATAM Finance Limited, 
a limited liability company established in the 
Caiman Islands and exclusively owned by LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A., issued on the international 
market, under Standard 144-A and Regulation 
S of the US securities act, unsecured long-term 
bonds called LATAM 2026 for a notional amount 
of US$600,000,000 at an annual interest rate 
of 7 .00%. The bonds were placed at an issuance 
price of 99.309% of their par value. The bonds 
have biannual interest payments and full capital 
amortization at maturity, the maturity date be -
ing March 1st, 2026. As was announced to the 
market, the goal of the issuance and placement 
was for general corporate financing purposes.
b)  On June 6, 2019, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. is -
sued on the local market (Santiago Stock Ex -
change) unsecured long-term bonds called 
Series E (BLATM-E), corresponding to the first 
series of bonds charged to the line registered in 
the Registry of the Financial Market Commis -
sion (“CMF” , for its Spanish acronym), under N° 
921 dated November 26, 2018, for a total of 
UF9,000,000.
The total sum issued was UF5,000,000 at an annu-
al coupon rate of 3.60% with biannual interest pay-
ments and maturing on April 15, 2029. The place-
ment rate was 2.73%, equivalent to THUS$215,093. Of the funds raised through the placement, 50% 
were destined to refinancing liabilities, 30% to fi-
nancing investments, and 20% for general corporate 
purposes.
c)  On July 11, 2019, LATAM Finance Limited, a lim-
ited liability company established in the Caiman 
Islands and exclusively owned by LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A., issued a re-opening of the LATAM 
2026 bond, issued on February 11, 2019, for 
US$200,000,000.This reopening had a placement 
rate of 5.979%.
Simultaneously, on July 11, 2019, LATAM Air -
lines Group S.A. announced the repurchase of up 
to US$300 million of the unsecured bond LATAM

a coupon rate of 7 .25% and maturing in June 2020. 
The buyback price of the offer was 103.8 cents per 
dollar of the face value of the bonds offered up to 
July 24, 2019; after that date and up to August 7, 
2019, the buyback price offered decreased to 100.8 
cents per dollar. At maturity of the offer, a total of 
US$238,412,000 of the bonds were repurchased, 
US$238,162,000 of were recovered on or prior to 
July 24, 2019, and US$250,000 after that date.
The income from the reopening of the LATAM 2026 
bond was used to pay for part of the public ten-
der of the LATAM 2020 bond. The remainder of the 
public tender was paid in cash.
On December 17, 2019, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. 
completed the repurchase of the balance (US$262 
million) of the LATAM 2020 unsecured bond which, 
added to the buyback from July 11, 2019, totaled 
the balance of the bond. The buyback was per -
formed through the so-called “Make-Whole” call 
mechanism, which is a right that the issuer of the 
bond has to buy back the outstanding debt balance, 
based on a price calculated using the US Treasury 
bonds with a similar maturity to the callable bond 
and adding a spread. The buyback price was 102.45 
cents per dollar of the nominal sum of the bonds.
Last, the Company’s net cash flow as at December 
31, 2019, prior to the effects of exchange rate differ -
ences, shows a negative variation of THUS$42,412, 
compared to the same period of a year earlier.4. FINANCIAL RISK ANAL YSIS
The goal of the Company’s global risk management 
program is to minimize the adverse effects of the 
financial risks that affect the company.
(a) Market risk
Given the nature of its business, the Company is ex -
posed to market factors, such as: (i) fuel price risk, 
(ii) interest rate risk, and (iii) local exchange rate risk.
(i) Fuel price risk
To carry out its operations, the Company purchas-
es fuel known as USGC 54 grade Jet Fuel, which is 
subject to variations in international fuel prices.
To hedge against fuel risk exposure, the Compa-
ny trades in derivatives instruments (Swaps and 
Options) whose underlying assets may be differ -
ent from Jet Fuel, whereby it is possible to hedge 
in West Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”), Brent 
crude oil (“BRENT”), and distilled Heating Oil (“HO”), 
which are closely related to Jet Fuel and have 
greater liquidity.
At December 31, 2019, the Company recognized 
THUS$23,138 in losses on fuel hedges, net of pre-
miums. Part of the spreads resulting between the 
lower and higher market value of these contracts 
is recognized as a hedge reserves component in 
the Company’s net equity. At December 31, 2019, 
the market value of existing contracts stood at 
THUS$48,542 (positive).(ii) Exchange rate risk
The functional currency, also used in presenting 
the Parent Company’s Financial Statements, is 
the US dollar; therefore, Transactional and Con -
version exchange rate risks are mainly a result of 
the operating activities of the business, as well as 
the Company’s strategic and accounting activities, 
which are presented in monetary units other than 
the functional currency.
LATAM’s Affiliates are also exposed to exchange 
rate risk, whose impact affects the Company's 
Consolidated Result.
The greatest exposure to exchange rate risk for LATAM 
comes from the concentration of businesses in Bra -
zil, as they are mainly denominated in Brazilian Reals 
(BRL), and it is managed actively by the Company.
The Company minimizes exchange risk exposure by 
contracting derivative instruments or through natu -
ral hedges or the execution of internal transactions.
At December 31, 2019, the market value of FX po -
sitions totaled THUS$41 (negative).
During the period ended on December 31, 2019, the 
Company recognized a gain of THUS$1,907 from F/X 
hedges net of premiums. Part of the spreads result -
ing between the lower and higher market value of 
these contracts is recognized as a hedge reserves 
component in the Company’s net equity. At Decem -

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  Creditsber 31, 2019, the Company has active derivatives FX 
contracts worth US$15 million.
During 2018, the company contracted FX derivatives 
which were not recorded under hedge accounting. At 
December 31, 2019, the sum recognized under re -
sults totals THUS$6,183 (negative) net of premiums.
The Company has signed cross-currency swaps 
(CCS) to dollarize the cash flows of existing obli -
gations, both contracted in Chile’s inflation-linked 
units (Unidades de Fomento, UF), with a fixed in -
terest rate. Through this financial instrument, it 
is possible to pay an interest rate in dollars, both 
fixed and floating (LIBOR plus a fixed spread).
At December 31, 2019, the market value of the 
CCS positions totaled THUS$22,662 (negative).
(iii) Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to variations in interest 
rates on the markets, affecting the future cash flows 
of its current and future financial assets and liabilities.The Company is mainly exposed to the London 
Inter Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) and other less rele -
vant interest rates, such as Brazilian Interbank De -
posit Certificates (“CDI”).
In order to reduce the risk from an eventual hike in 
interest rates, the Company has entered interest 
rate swap contracts. With regard to said contracts, 
the Company pays and receives, or only receives, 
as may be the case, the spread between the agreed 
fixed rate and the floating rate calculated on the 
capital outstanding in each contract. For these con -
tracts, the Company recognized in the results of 
this period a US$1.80 million loss. Losses and gains 
on interest rate swaps are recognized as a com -
ponent of the financial expense over the amorti -
zation of the hedged loan. At December 31, 2019, 
the market value of the existing interest rate swap 
contracts was THUS$2,618 (positive).
At December 31, 2019, roughly 62% of the debt 
has a fixed rate or is linked to one of the above -
mentioned instruments. The average debt rate is 
4.63% including the rate hedge.(b)  Concentration of credit risk
A high percentage of the Company’s accounts re -
ceivables comes from passengers, cargo services 
for individuals, and various trade companies that 
are spread out both economically and geographi -
cally; thus, they are generally short term. Thereby, 
the Company is not exposed to a significant con -
centration of credit risk.
5. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
In order to analyze the economic environment in 
which the Company exists, below we present a 
brief explanation of the situation and evolution of 
the main economies that affect it nationally, re-
gionally, and worldwide.
During 2019, the growth of global activity has 
slowed down, as a result of higher trade barriers, 
uncertainty in the international trade scenario to-
gether with the geopolitical situation, and various 
idiosyncratic factors that cause macroeconom-
ic tensions in emerging markets. All this is partly countered by the expansionary monetary policies 
both of emerging and developed economies.
Global growth is expected to reach 2.9% in 2019, 
3.3% in 2020, and 3.4% in 2021, showing a 0.1 
percentage point (“p.p. ”) contraction in 2019 and 
2020, and 0.2 p.p. in 2021, compared to the lat -
est forecast by the International Money Fund. This 
contraction is mainly due to slower than expected 
performance from developing economies (main-
ly Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey). On the 
other hand, growth is driven by the fact that the 
emerging economies have maintained a sound per -
formance, even though economies such as China 
continue to slow down. Moreover, the effects of the 
monetary stimulus, transversally both within de-
veloped and emerging economies, are expected to 
have a positive effect on global growth.
The United States is expected to achieve moderate 
growth of 2.3% in 2019, 2.0% in 2020 (0.1 p.p. low-
er than previously expected), and 1.7% in 2021, and 
its slower growth reflects the return to a neutral 
fiscal policy.
As for Europe, growth is expected to increase from 
1.2% in 2019 to 1.3% in 2020 (0.1 p.p. less than in 
the FMI’s October estimates), and to 1.4% in 2021. 
The growth of external demand is expected to be 
the main factor of this acceleration. Growth es-
timates for France and Italy remained, but those 
for Germany were downwardly revised for 2020, 
as manufacturing activity remains on a contracting

Suppliers  |  Customers  |  Environment  |  Employees  |  Security  |  Society  |  Methodology  |  Appendices  |  Financial information  |  Creditstrend since late 2019. Moreover, the Spanish econ-
omy remains affected by a greater than expected 
slowdown in domestic demand and exports during 
2019. The United Kingdom’s growth remained un-
changed from the last estimate, awaiting an orderly 
exit from the European Union, followed by a gradu-
al transition to a new economic relationship.
On the other hand, the Latin American economy is 
expected to recover from an estimated growth of 
0.1% in 2019, to 1.6% in 2020 and 2.3% in 2021, al-
beit below the FMI’s last estimates by 0.2 p.p. and 
0.1 p.p. for 2020 and 2021, respectively. Downward 
revisions are the result of downward adjustments 
to Mexico’s growth outlook, due to an ongoing 
weakening in investment, and of the effect that the 
protests witnessed in the last few months could 
have on Chile. These drops are countered by in-
creased optimism regarding growth in Brazil, mainly 
due to the improvements followed by the pensions 
reform and fewer disruptions in the mining sec -
tor. Along this line, Brazil’s GDP growth for 2019, 
2020, and 2021 is expected to reach 1.2%, 2.2%, and 2.3%, respectively (a +0,2 p.p. adjustment for 
2020 and -0,1 p.p. for 2021 compared to the last 
estimates), while for Chile, GDP is expected to have 
grown 1.0% in 2019 (-1,5 p.p. vs. the previous es-
timate), while 2020 growth also suffered a signifi-
cant downward revision.
In this economic environment, the flexibility of the 
business model that the Company has implemented 
is essential to better face the economic fluctuations.a) Below, we are presenting the main financial
