Sustainability
Report 2013This report, for the 2012 calendar year, is 
the ﬁ rst sustainability report prepared by 
Nufarm Limited.  While we have publicly reported on health, safety and environmental performance for the past 13 years, this report is the ﬁ  rst to provide information relating to 
a broader range of performance indicators.  
The health and safety data is collected 
from Nufarm manufacturing sites, of ﬁ ces 
and regional service centres.  It does not include data from eight of ﬁ ces in Asia and 
South America due to a lack of available information.
The health and safety data includes 
permanent and casual employees as well as contractors.  Targets set by the Nufarm board have been included, with the expectation of a 15% improvement annually.
Environmental data is provided by our 
manufacturing plants and summarised for this report.  Further detail about individual site performance can be found on our website: www.nufarm.com.
Our ﬁ  nancial performance and detail about 
corporate governance are provided in our 
annual and half yearly reports which are also available on our website.About us – overview of operations 2

We are seeking to enhance the value of our core chemistry positions, while growing faster into higher value product and market segments that are more defendable. Our business strategy has been complemented in recent years with the ReNu program which is aimed at identifying opportunities for short and long term efﬁ  ciency gains and business 
improvements.
As of the end of June 2013, ReNu 
had generated A$21.5 million in pro ﬁ t 
improvements.  The beneﬁ  ts include 
improved employee development and project management capability across the business with over 200 employees now trained in Prince2
® and AtTask® 
project management methodologies.
From the start of the program in 
2011, employees have identi ﬁ ed 
more than 1,000 major improvement opportunities of which 51 percent have either been actioned or are inthe process of being completed.
Economic impact
Our ﬁ  nancial results are released 
annually and reﬂ  ect the period
1 August to 31 July.  We also release our half yearly results for the period1 August to 31 January.  These reports can be found on our website.
Our impact on, and contribution to,
the economy is more signiﬁ  cant 
than our ﬁ  nancial performance.  
Our contribution in Australia and internationally includes both direct and indirect employment, support of farming practices to improve ef ﬁ ciency 
and productivity, the support of local suppliers, capital investment programs, payment of taxes and contribution to local communities.
Sustainabilityat Nufarm
At Nufarm we see sustainability as an overarching business strategy that creates ﬁ nancial value by delivering 
solutions and providing environmental beneﬁ  ts. This is further demonstrated by our commitment to Responsible Care
®, an initiative of the International 
Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA), which is supported and managed by regional chemical associations.
The program is aimed at improving 
the health, safety and environmental (HS&E) performance of supporting companies and increased community involvement and awareness of the industry.  It supports product stewardship, employee management, business and supply chain partners, and external stakeholders. Responsible Care
® allows the industry to 
demonstrate continuous HS&E improvement to the community, its customers, and to government which view commitment to the program as an important component of maintaining a licence to operate.
In Australia, Nufarm is a founding 
member and signatory to Responsible Care
® and the Sustainability 
Leadership Framework through the Australia’s Plastics and Chemical Industry Association (PACIA).While the Framework is speciﬁ  c to 
our Australian operations, we believe its overarching direction is applicable to all aspects of Nufarm and its subsidiaries. Nufarm is also a signatory to Responsible Care
® in a number 
of other countries, including:  Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and theUnited Kingdom.
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2013 4
Nufarm has had a long standing 
commitment to report publicly onour performance against various health, safety and environmental parameters. While these areas of activity remain critically important,our shift to sustainability reporting allows us to communicate our initiatives across a broader range of stakeholder engagement indicators.
Nufarm’s products help farmers 
protect their crops from damage caused by weeds, pests and disease. And we are breeding and supplying new seed varieties that improve the yield and value of certain crops.
As a company engaged in the 
development, production and supply of inputs to agriculture, we work in an industry where sustainability principles are entrenched. Farmers – and other users of our products – have followed and reﬁ  ned sustainable 
practices for many years and know that these principles are all-important in maintaining the productive capacity of their land.
Our commitment to these same 
principles is very strong, and this report reﬂ  ects a solid performance in key safety and environment measures and some excellent employee and community engagement activities. While we improved our performance in certain measures of safety, we did not meet our objectives for continuous improvement in other areas. This reinforces our need to strive for further improvement and better outcomes.
Our corporate strategic growth plan 
is strongly focused on a platform of innovation and discipline. In the2012 ﬁ  nancial year, we made a 
number of changes in the business and strengthened our management teams. A company wide business improvement program, called ReNu, harnessed the feedback and ideas of many of our employees to develop and implement efﬁ  ciencies and cost 
savings and to introduce better project management skills throughout the business. We also introduced new products and initiatives such as our recyclable QuikPour packaging.
Nufarm employees around the 
world contribute signiﬁ  cantly to the 
communities in which they workand live. We have a clear responsibility to provide a safe environment in which they work and to offer development and training opportunities that allow our people to pursue a range of opportunities within the company.Our 2012 employee survey shows that our people are more satis ﬁ ed in their 
roles than they were when the survey was last conducted in 2010.
We will continue to look for ways 
to strengthen our commitment to 
sustainability and I look forward to keeping you updated on that progress in future reports.
Managing Director’s message
Sustainability is a cornerstone of Nufarm’s approach to doing business and I am very pleased that the company is now moving to more comprehensive reporting of our efforts and performance across key sustainability measures and activity.

Innovation is a key platform for Nufarm 
and is reﬂ  ective of the evolution of
our business. 
Nufarm develops, manufactures 
and markets innovative and differentiated crop protection products in our markets around the world. While we do not discover new chemical molecules, we invest in the development of new mixtures and formulations; improved delivery systems; innovative packaging; and other improvements that add valuefor the users of our products. 
Innovation and differentiation at 
Nufarm typically involves developing safer, healthier and more efﬁ  cient 
formulations and applications.This may involve ﬁ  nding ways 
to reduce the quantity of active ingredient in a product through using an alternative solvent or introducing slow release technology. 
In other instances we may look at 
increasing the concentration of an active ingredient in order to reduce volume.  This has positive impacts on the supply chain with less warehousing space needed and reduced transport deliveries which in turn reduces greenhouse emissions.
Product innovation may also focus 
on improving the health and safety beneﬁ  ts of products.  This was the 
driver of our unique Sorbie technology which is used to manufacture a blank water dispersible granule, which isthen infused with a liquid active ingredient to form a solid emulsi ﬁ able 
concentrate. There are a number of beneﬁ  ts of this granular technology, 
but most importantly, it means that the product is easier to control and disperse and therefore less hazardous for operators. 
Nuseed
Nuseed is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nufarm. It is a global seed company focused on improving food and feed value through enhancing the value of three crop types – canola, sorghum and sunﬂ  ower – by developing seeds 
with greater purpose. Nuseed’s research and innovation efforts are focused on creating better food, feed and fuel solutions around the world. A recent Nuseed innovation was the launch of a new product named Wholis™ – a type of sorghum bredfor human consumption that has improved milling characteristics andis gluten free. 
The environmental ﬂ  exibility and 
drought hardiness of sorghum means 
it is well suited to areas that may be marginal for the production of other cereal grain crops, such as wheat and barley. As the world’s sixth largest crop, the new Wholis™ innovation aims to move sorghum from a feed grain to create a premium food sourcefor people.
Omega-3 canola
Nuseed, the Commonwealth Scienti ﬁ c 
& Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Australian Grains Research & Development Corporation (GRDC) formed a research collaboration to develop a high quality, sustainable, renewable and reliable source of long-chain omega-3 oil for human consumption. 
Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are 
necessary for human health and have Innovation
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2013 8traditionally been obtained by eating 
wild ﬁ  sh. With increasing demand on 
global ocean ﬁ  sh supplies, access to 
high quality long-chain omega-3  is under pressure.  
The collaboration is looking at a 
solution via genetically engineered canola that contains ﬁ  sh-like levels of 
long-chain omega-3, which reduces our current reliance on ocean ﬁ  sh. 
Land plant-based production is a sustainable, renewable and therefore long-term solution to the growing demand for long-chain omega-3 oils. Every hectare of long chain Omega-3 canola is expected to produce an amount of oil equivalent to that produced by 10,000 ﬁ  sh. 
The collaboration currently anticipates being ready for commercial production in 2018.

9 NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2013NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2013 10At Nufarm we are committed to 
managing environmental impacts at all our sites.  As detailed in our health, safety and environmental policy, one key focus is on protecting the environment. The policy sets out key requirements for all sites regarding regulatory compliance, monitoring of efﬂ uent and emissions, recording and 
reporting of environmental incidents audit and waste management and contamination management.
All of our sites have environmental 
management systems in place, in varying degrees of complexity and development. Some of the sites have formalised ISO14001 accredited systems, but most do not. The management systems and performance against them are checked annually during detailed audits carried out by the group HSE manager to ensure consistent application of Nufarm requirements across the business. The systems may vary across the Nufarm group mainly due to the vast differences in the complexity of operations. Nufarm policy requires sites to meet local environmental regulations and/or Nufarm standards, whichever is tighter. 
In 2012 our environmental expenditure 
was A$6.4 million.
The following sections detail our 2012 
environmental performance across our key manufacturing sites according to ﬁ ve key impact areas:
  compliance and complaints
  energy and greenhouse gas
  air emissions
  water
  waste
W
e have included key issues from 
some sites.  Full details applicable
to each site can be found in location-speci ﬁ c reports.Compliance and complaints
Each country in which we operate has different regulatory requirements and we establish site speci ﬁ c 
environmental management systems to ensure our compliance. 
For example at our site in Wyke, UK 
we operate a fully integrated Health, Safety, Environmental and Quality Management System that is registered to BS EN ISO14001:2004 and BS EN ISO 9001:2008 Standards.  In New Zealand, the site processes meet the strict standards of our Location Test Certiﬁ  cate, which is a requirement 
of the NZ Environmental Resource Management Agency (ERMA).
In a signiﬁ  cant milestone, our plant in 
France received ISO 14001 certi ﬁ cation 
in November 2012.
Environmental management
and performance
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 201311During 2012 we worked to address 
two compliance issues raised by Victoria’s Environment Protection Authority at our Laverton site.  One related to a Pollution Abatement Notice involving bunding and the other a Pollution Abatement Notice associated with groundwater contamination.
Compliance testing
Nufarm undertakes environmental compliance testing and reporting at almost all sites. Where there are standards against which to measure compliance, we measure emissions from air, water and efﬂ  uents sent of 
off-site treatment (e.g. sewerage) which includes discharge from scrubbers and (in some cases)fugitive emissions.
Complaints
As part of our compliance program we keep a record of all complaints, most of which relate to odour or noise. As some materials we handle are odourous, especially insecticides, we aim to ensure the areas where these materials are handled or used are well ventilated and any extracted air is treated to remove odourous components. In 2012 there were eight complaints for which Nufarm accepted responsibility. Of these accepted complaints, one was from Botlek in the Netherlands, six from Gaillon in France, and one from Wyke in the UK.
Energy and 
greenhouse gas
Total greenhouse emissions increased 
in 2012 compared with 2011.  This is due to an increase in production and changes in product mix at some sites.  Across our sites, most of the fuel used comprised gas which is consumed across a variety of processes such as: 
 heating in Calgary, Chicago and 
Genne
villiers
 cogeneration in  Gaillon and Wyke
 heating boilers in Kwinana and La
verton 
 running granules plants in Otahuhu and W
elshpool  
Fuel is also consumed as diesel and liquid petroleum gas (LGP) for mobile plants at most sites.While overall emissions have 
increased, emissions per tonne of production have remained consistent.
While CO
2 emissions associated with
most sites remained consistent, 
there was a large increase at our site in Wyke, UK.  This was a result of increased production and a change in product mix at the site. Some sitesalso emit CO
2 directly from chemical 
processes are included in the data reﬂ ected in Figure 2.We continue to focus on reducing energy use across all our sites. Compared with many chemical companies, we are a relatively moderate energy user.  Energy use is impacted by production volume and the product mix.
The majority of greenhouse gas is 
generated from electricity and gas used in the production process.30,000

Figure 3    CO 2 emissions from energy use and processesNUFARM SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2013 12The major greenhouse emitter is 
our Laverton manufacturing plant.  Our second largest emitter is Wyke, however it generates a little over half the emissions of Laverton.
Chlorine production at Laverton is the 
most energy intensive process on site.  More efﬁ  cient chlorine technology 
with the potential to offer large energy savings is being investigated. An upgrade to the boiler control room at Laverton has been partially undertaken and is expected to afford gas savings greater than two percent.  Plant and process efﬁ  ciencies 
including lighting upgrades are also being investigated.
Greenhouse gas emissions at our 
production site in Wyke have increased largely as a result of greater production and a change in the product mix.  However while production volumes have more than doubled since 2008, overall energy use and greenhouse emissions is around the 2008 levels.  
This has been achieved through a 
number of initiatives including a focus on managing steam implemented in 2012, whereby changing the operating conditions on one of the distillation columns created a steam saving of 32.5 tonnes per week.
Activities also took place at other 
sites. At Kwinana in Western Australia,  some simple energy conversation activities implemented at the site resulted in savings of A$120,000.  These activities included turning out lights in areas not being accessed at 
night and planning production so that the boiler could be turned off regularly when not required.
Air emissions
Air emissions result from the production proc ess.  We work to 
minimise emissions and their impact.
Emissions vary depending on production
volumes and the product mix.
Some emissions such as carbon 
monoxide (CO), sulfur oxides (SOx) and particulates are calculated from energy use, based on published emissions factors. This also applies to nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions at all sites with one exception. In Wyke in the UK, nitration reactions are carried out and there is some recovery of NOx. The site also has continuous NOx measurements on its stacks. 
CO, NOx and SOx are mostly 
calculated from factors published for various combustion processes. Our Wyke operation carries out direct measurements. The major increase in CO for 2012 was due to a faulty burner in the co-generation plant (CHP), which has since been ﬁ  xed. Variations 
in NOx over the years are due to the difﬁ culty in accurate measurements 
of discharge concentrations on the same CHP plant. The major decrease in VOC in 2010 was due to cessation of synthesis processes in Gaillon at the end of 2009.
Emission control equipment has been 
a key consideration in the design of recently constructed plant at our site in Otahuhu near Auckland, New Zealand.  The dust ﬁ  ltering equipment, 
in particular, has been very successful 0.40

These design considerations, made by 
Nufarm engineers, are aimed at future-prooﬁ  ng our business by ensuring 
that we meet our environmental requirements today and in the future.
Water
Water is used in most of our production processes.  The amount of water used and waste water generated is directly impacted by production volumes and the product mix. We aim to reduce the amount of water we use and also the amount of waste water created.
To ensure mains water supply is 
conserved many of our sites collect rain water run-off, treat it if necessary, and use it to irrigate our gardens.
For example in Welshpool, the site’s 
yard surfaces are divided into clean and potentially contaminated areas.  Stormwater from areas where thereis no potential for contamination from chemicals is used to water gardens and lawns, or is discharged into the municipal storm water system.  Water which may be potentially contaminated with chemicals is either fully contained with no stormwater impact, or directed into a 200,000 L sealed pit.  Water is retained in this pit until tested and, if required, is treated before disposal into stormwater soak.
The plant in Canada has implemented 
a water-recycling program reducing the amount of water required from municipal supply.  The program involves collecting rain and snow melt water, and using this soft water resource in some of our products.  Air-conditioning systems have also been upgraded further reducing our use of water.
In Indonesia we use two sources of 
water.  It is either supplied by the water companies or comes from deep well extraction.  Deep well water is used only for domestic purposes, whereas the water from the water company is used for the production process, safety shower and eye wash.
Most of our sites recycle vessel 
washings to be used in the next 
formulations for the same product as part of our water conservation program.
As well as fully bunded storage 
areas, our Kwinana site also has a fully maintained sealed stormwater network.  Stormwater is treated with activated carbon and tested before it is discharged to ground via a conventional storm water soak. The sealed stormwater system was tested during the year when an intermodal container was damaged during transport around the site and leaked 800 litres of an environmentally harmful liquid.  Our spill response systems were activated resulting in no discharge to the environment and all stormwater discharge limits were met.  Corrective actions were taken to lessen the chance of a similar event recurring. 
Waste
We have programs at each site to minimise waste generation. Where possible we aim to recycle orre-use waste.
Total waste increased in 2012 compared
with 2011.  While most waste streams increased or decreased only slightly, there was a signiﬁ  cant increase in salt 
waste because of increased production of phenoxy herbicides in Wyke.
Salty efﬂ  uent is produced as a direct 
consequence of our chlorination 
processes.  This salty efﬂ  uent is 
contaminated with organic material and cannot be discharged directly to the environment.  The efﬂ  uent 
is mostly treated in sewage plants 2,000

before the salt is released into natural water bodies.  The waste dischargedto deep well is almost entirely salt.
Other wastes include inorganics, clean 
solids, organics, chlorinated, drums, regulated solids and agricultural. The majority of waste goes to sewage treatment followed by recycling, energy recovery, landﬁ  ll, surface water, 
deep well and industrial treatment.
At many of our sites a waste 
management system captures the nature and quantity of waste produced on site and tracks it through to recycling or disposal. In 2012 signiﬁ  cant progress was achieved 
with a program to dispose of plant washings and wastes from redundant product lines.  We continue to work towards further reducing waste generation from manufacturing processes.  Disposal of packaging such as empty raw material containers (drums and bags) can contribute huge volumes to land ﬁ  ll. The site 
makes every effort to clean its waste packaging and ﬁ  nd recycling 
opportunities.  
We have implemented an initiative to 
recycle wooden pallets at Laverton following collaboration with a local supplier.  We now sell the used wooden pallets to a customer who refurbishes and reuses them for the export of raw hides.  This has reduced the volume going to land ﬁ ll and 
formed a revenue stream.  In 2009 disposal of pallets incurred a cost of A$10,000 to the business for in excess of 15,000 pallets.  This new collaboration has generated revenue of A$10,000 for the resale of18,500 pallets.
A core part of Nufarm’s Canadian 
mandate is to lead standards in responsible packaging, container return policies and waste reduction practices.  This is primarily a blending and packaging operation, taking raw concentrated products, processing and diluting them to a usable strength and packaging them into containers.
Every attempt is made to reduce waste
by recycling plastic, cardboard and wood wherever possible. Wastes requiring disposal consist of empty packaging from raw materials received, used ﬁ  lters, debris, and safety 
equipment from the formulationand packaging operations.60

Health and safety
We place a high priority on safeguarding
the health and safety of our employees. Our health, safety and environment (HS&E) policy is a public statement of Nufarm’s commitment to HS&E, and is a statement ofthe standards expected of Nufarm’s employees.
A number of Nufarm plants operate under strict
regulations including Seveso II in Europe and 
Major Hazard Facilities in Australia.  Such sitesneed to prepare a safety case which provides
evidence that the site’s systems and procedures
are adequate for safe operation.  The safety case is regularly reviewed by authorities and requires a new and full review and submission 
every ﬁ  ve years.
Overall, our 2012 health and safety performance improved from 2011. Our Lost 
Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) recorded 
a 27% improvement, Medical Treatment Injury Frequency Rate [MTIFR] a 40% improvement and severity rate a 46% improvement.
Disappointingly, we failed to meet the target 
limits set by the board for lost time injuries (LTI), medical treatment injuries (MTI) and severity. Efforts are continuing to improve safe working conditions and ensure our health, safety and environment policy and procedures are followed at all times.
PSM: The Journey to Date 
In last year’s Annual Report we provided an overview of the ﬁ rst 
steps taken by Nufarm to develop a structured and systematic approach to improving Process Safety Management (PSM) across all of our manufacturing sites.  Six manufacturing sites were assessed between 2011 and 2012: four in Europe, a ﬁ fth in Chicago 
and the sixth in Melbourne. This has allowed approaches that have evolved under quite different regulatory regimes to be compared and contrasted so that common operating principles could be developed.
The key elements for examination were identiﬁ  ed at process 
safety management workshops held at Gaillon, France in July 2011. 
Further workshops were held at our Melbourne site in late 2012 to build on the European activities and work towards development of common guidelines for adoption across the Nufarm manufacturing base.
This 18-month programme of work culminated in a ﬁ nal report 
which identiﬁ  ed common strengths and weaknesses in relation 
to process safety management and set out guiding principles 
to promote alignment of best practice and improvement where needed – all within a continuous improvement framework.  The new Corporate Guiding Principles were drafted in late 2012 and issued to sites earlier this year.
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2013 16Lost time injuries
Nufarm deﬁ  nes lost time injuries as 
those that result in loss of working time 
of at least one full shift. We operate from the premise that all lost time injuries are preventable.
Nufarm’s overall LTIFR in 2012 was 
2.24, which is higher than our target of 1.16, but an improvement compared to 3.08 in 2011.  The 15 lost time injuries suffered in 2012 were spread over seven sites, with two sites accounting for ten of the LTIs. This was an improvement on the 20 LTIs recorded in 2011. The causes of these injuries were two chemical burns, ﬁ  ve were strains due to 
lifting objects, and the remainder were slips, trips and falls.All these injuries were preventable.
In 2012, 33 locations worked for the
entire year without any injury 
sufﬁ ciently severe to require an 
absence from work of one or more 
days. Safety awards are presented to 
sites that have achieved 200,000 hours 
free of lost time injury. For small sites, 
an award is achieved if the site has 
worked for 5 years without
serious injury.
Medical treatment injuries
Nufarm takes the approach of 
recording medical treatment injuries.  We consider medical treatment injuries to include all injuries that result in loss of time as well as those that require treatment by a quali ﬁ ed medical 
practitioner (excluding those that are of a diagnostic or precautionary nature only).  Those injuries that could be treated by a person trained in ﬁ rst aid 
or a qualiﬁ  ed nurse are not considered 
medical treatment injuries.
In 2012 there were 21 medical treatment 
injuries of which six did not involve loss of working days.
Severity
Severity is a measure of the seriousness of the injuries that resulted in loss of working days (severity rate = days lost per thousand hours worked).
Our global performance improved in 
2012, with a fall in severity  to 0.028 (from 0.052 in 2011). This improvement can be attributed to the signi ﬁ cant 
and sustained effort applied across the business following the poor resultsin 2011.

Our people
Nufarm’s manufacturing and marketing 
operations are based in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and the Americas. We therefore employ many people, all of whom make a vital contribution to the company’s reputation for quality products, innovation and best practice marketing and technical support.
At Nufarm, our approach to people 
management is focused on attracting and protecting our most important assets – people – and building our reputation as a global employer.We coordinate strategic human resources and organisational development at a global level, but day to day operations are managed at the regional level. This means that people report through to the human resource heads of the respective regional businesses which allows the function to stay in touch with the needs ofthe business. 
In 2012 we had 2,826 permanent 
employees. We also engage employees on a casual or temporary basis mainly in the manufacturing areas.Focus on diversity
As a global company, Nufarm recruits people from around the world.We believe that our employees from many different cultures, linguistic and national backgrounds provide us with valuable knowledge for understanding and operating pro ﬁ tably in complex 
international markets. In 2012 we undertook a review ofdiversity at Nufarm to better understand our proﬁ  le and identify 
opportunities for improvement.In response, we introduced a diversity policy in 2012 which is available on our website. We also reviewed a number of practices to ensure they supported diversity.  These included a review of ﬂ exible working hours, recruitment and 
selection processes, and expatriate and relocation policies.
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2013 18Performance 
management
We also developed the Nufarm global performance management and development process in 2012 which provides an opportunity for discussion with employees. This process has formalised our approach to managing and attracting talent for the business. A formal process to collect global gender and cultural diversity statistics was also established and we reviewed the board selection criteria to ensure gender diversity is encouraged.
Employee engagement
Every two years, Nufarm administers a global survey of employees across the business. The most recent survey was conducted in September 2012. The results indicated strong engagement and a higher level of job satisfaction than in a similar survey undertaken two years earlier. That improvement was reﬂ ected across our global businesses 
and various job functions and is particularly strong among employees who were directly involved in business improvement and efﬁ  ciency initiatives 
undertaken during the past year. 
The survey is translated into all 
applicable languages to enable participation from every employee.The survey consists of a set of standard questions for all employees, but also nationally includes speci ﬁ c 
open questions. Each region is encouraged to develop speciﬁ  c and 
relevant questions in order to capture rich data that is applicable to the locality and is reﬂ  ective of its issues, 
challenges and cultural diversity.This allows Nufarm to interpret ﬁ ndings and outcomes that 
are applicable globally but also understand perspectives at regional and local levels. 
An area of focus to come out of the 
last global survey was around reward and recognition. In response, Nufarm has established two global awards: innovation and sales.

engagement is to develop proactive relationships with local communities.  We do not have a company-wide community engagement policy or strategy but prefer our local sites to develop and implement their own approach, making sure the people important to our industry and operations are engaged, participating and supported. 
Our commitment to community 
support is further demonstrated by our membership with Responsible Care
®, 
an initiative of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). The program aims to improve the health, safety and environmental performance of supporting companies and increase community involvement and awareness of the industry.It includes a Community Right toKnow Code of Practice.  
Following is a snapshot of some 
community engagement activities from across Nufarm’s global operations.Australia
Our Australian employees have been supporting their local communities for over three decades.  Community engagement and interface continues through well-established education programs including science tours, farmer visits to site and a number of in-kind support opportunities such as science lectures for students along with sustained contributions to community arts facilities and partnerships.The team at Nufarm’s Regional Service Centre (RSC) in Esperance took part in a training exercise with the local Fire and Emergency Services Authority (FESA) volunteer group. The Esperance community and the surrounding area depends on these FESA volunteers to coordinate emergency services in case of a natural disaster and emergency incidents that could threat life and property.The Esperance RSC allows FESA to use of the site every second year to train volunteers under strictly supervised conditions in dealing with search and recovery, chemical spills and ﬁ res.

Nufarm New Zealand believes in 
developing a strong bond with its community through the provision of opportunities for young people. In 2012 students were again invited to experience a day in the life of a business, helping them make career decisions.
The company has also made managers 
and supervisors available to assist with business enterprise competitions.The contestants have been local senior high school students, with Nufarm employees acting as mentors.
Indonesia
Water has been the community support focus for Nufarm’s Indonesian teams.  During the reporting period, parts of Indonesia were affected by severe drought.  To help alleviate this problem, Nufarm supplied clean water to the local community.
United States
In the past year there was a strengthening of support for localand national communities byNufarm Americas.
Our North American head ofﬁ  ce in 
Alsip has formed a strong partnership 
with the Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences (CHSAS).Over 2,400 items were donated to a food drive sponsored by the school, which was just one of several activities between the two organisations. 
In North Carolina, Nufarm volunteers 
worked a day of service with the Professional Landcare Network (PLANET) an initiative of the lawncare industry, doing garden maintenance at the local Girl Scout headquarters building.
A group of 33 Nufarm employees 
and family members gathered in Washington, DC for ‘Renewal and Remembrance’.  On this day, which Nufarm has sponsored since 2006, hundreds of turf industry professionals donate time, materials and expertise to maintain and beautify Arlington National Cemetery. It attracts over500 participants every year to the250-acre site.
France
At Nufarm’s manufacturing facility 
in Gaillon, we are proud of the new landscaping works that have enhanced the visual space and created a new green space for our team to enjoy.  
The ‘D’ building had been standing 
since the 1950s and was the main manufacturing building on the site. It had served its purpose well as the main location for the production of detergent and surfactant, includingthe product range ‘Galoryl’. However,it was recognised that a site restructurewas necessary. Production at the ‘D’ building was wound down at the end of 2010 and it was scheduled to be demolished. 
Prior to the demolition of the old 
building, it was agreed that a large green space would be created in its place, rather than ﬁ  lling it with 
another structure. This would improve the aesthetic appeal of the local environmental and also create a space for Nufarm employees to enjoy.

A key focus of our community 
engagement activities in the UK involves working with schools and support for local sporting teams.  In 2012 we continued to provide instruction on industrial chemistry to a number of schools in the local community, including a two-day course on laboratory procedures and protocols.  The course is an integral part of their studies in applied chemistry and the contribution each student makes is formally assessed as part of their end of year grade.  In addition, seven students carried out work experience at the Wyke manufacturing site.
Colombia
Nufarm’s plant in Colombia holds meetings every three months with community leaders to talk about our activities and projects, and listen to any concerns or issues they may have.
Last year, as part of our membership 
under Responsible Care
®, we took 
part in a public consultative panel on the new chemical transport program. This involved meeting government employees, leaders of the private industrial sector and members ofthe community.
Our Colombian team also supports 
community education via involvement with SENA, a national government entity that provides technical training for employees and the community.  A main objective of the program isto train and educate speci ﬁ c age 
groups or vulnerable groups in production areas.Brazil
Our plant in Fortaleza, Brazil 
supported the community with children’s gifts on holidays such as Christmas and Children’s Day. We also run an open house program to show people what happens at the plant which attracted more than 305 local stakeholders in 2012. 
To support local employment, Nufarm 
Brazil operates a training program. Approximately thirty students from local universities and schools have worked at Nufarm through this program. We also support the Enactus organisation, as outlined in the case study below.
We actively encourage and support 
the inclusion of disadvantaged or unskilled people into our workforce. Currently, three percent of employees in the workforce are physically challenged and ﬁ  ve percent of non-
technical employees are inexperienced students from public schools.Supporting Enactus in Brazil 
Enactus is an international non-pro ﬁ t 
organization that brings together 
student, academic and business leaders who are committed to using the power 
of entrepreneurial action to improve the 
quality of life and standard of living for people in need. Guided by academic advisors and business experts, the 
student leaders of Enactus create and 
implement community empowerment 
projects around the globe.The experience not only transforms lives, it helps students develop the 
kind of talent and perspective that are 
essential to leadership in an ever-more 
complicated and challenging world. 
Seeking to stimulate awareness and 
ethics for the adequate and safe use of agrochemicals by small producers in the region, Nufarm Brazil has set up a partnership with Enactus. Teams of local students are encouraged to develop innovative projects with the potential to implement change and positively inﬂ uence the agrobusiness

Nufarm recognises the enhanced 
business value of a robust approach to procurement. We have been working to deﬁ  ne and develop a 
policy and procurement structure that aligns business requirements and best practices.  This has involved the development of a global policy, professional standard and governance to create a common and coordinated approach to procurement acrossthe business.  
The global procurement policy 
documents a set of foundation principles, consisting of: 
  Health, safety and the environment
  Sustainability
  Corporate governance
  Continuous improvement
  Capability development
  Stakeholder relationship 
management
  Risk management
  Value for money
  Quality  T
he objective of this policy is to ensure 
that all procurement activities carried 
out by Nufarm:
 Provide best possible value through pr
oactive engagement of internal 
customers and suppliers
 Are conducted in a fair, objective and tr
ansparent manner
 Are compliant with the Nufarm’s c
orporate policies
 Are compliant with national and int
ernational law
 Encompass the short and long term objectiv
es of the business 
To further support this Nufarm has established a procurement advisory board which is responsible for ensuring appropriate and effective governance arrangements are in place. 
The procurement function assists 
Nufarm in its sustainability and corporate social responsibility objectives by integrating these principles into the procurementof all goods and services.The role of procurement is to help improve operational ef ﬁ ciencies, 
decrease overall costs and enhance Nufarm’s ability to react quickly to unexpected changes in supply or demand. Nufarm’s procurement approach aims to achieve value for money on a whole-of-life basis, whilst minimising damage to the environment. It focuses on generating beneﬁ  ts to Nufarm, as well as local 
communities and economies. 
Nufarm’s approach is based on 
class leading processes, operational discipline and stakeholder engagement. It is designed to deliver competitive advantage through building procurement capability and forging strong relationships with stakeholders. We proactively engage with end users where procurement decisions have the potential to impact on the safety of employees, assets, suppliers, contractors, customersand visitors.Procurement
