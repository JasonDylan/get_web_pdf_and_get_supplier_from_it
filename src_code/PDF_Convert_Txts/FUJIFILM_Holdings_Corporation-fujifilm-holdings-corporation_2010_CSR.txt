We will use leading-edge, proprietary technologies to provide top-
quality products and services that contribute to the advancement of culture, science, technology and industry, as well as improved health and environmental protection in society. Our overarching aim is to help enhance the quality of life of people worldwide.
Fujiﬁlm Group Vision
Anchored by an open, fair and clear corporate culture and with leading-edge, proprietary technologies, Fujifilm is determined to remain a leading company by boldly taking up the challenge of developing new products and creating new value.
Fujiﬁlm Group Charter for Corporate Behavior
In addition to pursuing profits through fair competition, corporations must make a contribution to society at large. To this end, the Fujifilm Group, in its corporate activities in Japan and abroad, respects human rights, observes both the spirit and the letter of all laws and regulations and international rules, and, acting in a socially responsible manner, works independently toward the sustainable development of society and the Fujifilm Group companies, in accordance with the following five principles.
1. A Trusted Company2. Social Responsibility3. Respect for Human Rights
4. Global Environmental Conservation
5. Vibrant Workplaces
Recognizing top management’s responsibility to embody the 
spirit of this Charter, Fujifilm Group executives shall lead by example and promote a sound understanding of the Charter both within Group companies and among business partners. They shall strive to continually take account of views within and outside the Group, establish efficient corporate systems, and foster high ethical standards.
In the event of situations that contravene this Charter, top 
management shall clearly indicate both within and outside the Group its approach to resolving the situation and work to identify its causes and prevent any recurrence. Top management shall be accountable, promptly and appropriately disclose information, and take strict disciplinary action when appropriate, including in regard to itself.
The Fujiﬁlm Group`s Approach to CSR
The Fujifilm Group’s Approach to CSR is to contribute to the sustainable development of society by putting into practice the Fujifilm Group’s Corporate Philosophy, and realizing its Vision through sincere and fair business activities.
We will:1.  fulfill our economic and legal responsibilities, and respond 
to society’s demands by contributing as a corporate citizen to the development of culture and technology in society and environmental preservation.
2.  constantly reassess whether our CSR activities are responding adequately to the demands and expectations of society and whether those activities are conducted properly through dialogue with our stakeholders including customers, shareholders, investors, employees, local communities, and business partners.
3.  enhance corporate transparency by actively disclosing information to fulfill our accountability for our business activities.Always asking ourselves questions 
The framework of the world economy is changing greatly 
with emer ging economies such as China, India, and Brazil 
gaining economic power in a dramatic way. Amid this trend, 
we can no longer keep up with the progress of society and 
the market by continuing to do business in the way that we 
did in the past.
In this age of change, it is as if we are being put 
through a huge sieve. In order to survive this sever e period, 
we must always ask ourselves what role we should play to 
make our existence meaningful to society and we need to 
completely review our past ways of doing busine ss. This 
is something we must do if we are to make progress and 
offer society unique products of higher quality and value. I 
believe this will eventually lead to the ful/f_illment of our cor-
porate philosophy: contributing to people`s quality of life 
and the achievement of sustainable management. 
What we did in the past,  what we should do  
in the future,  and how we should do it
At the beginning of the millennium, we faced a ldigital shockz 
that threatened our core business. In response, under the 
slogan of lSecond Foundation,z we restructur ed our photo-
graphic business and focused our managerial resour ces on 
our priority business /f_ields. Applying the nanotechnologies 
we accumulated in manufacturing photographic /f_ilm, we 
stepped boldly into new business /f_ields such as cosmetics, 
food supplements, and pharmaceuticals. As a result, we 
were able to record our highest ever sales and operating 
income in /f_iscal 2007 and made a V-shaped recovery at 
an unprecedented speed. Subsequently , the market began 
to shrink due to the world recession trigger ed by the col-
lapse of Lehman Brothers and all our business sectors suf-
fered a serious impact. In the face of this crisis, we restruc-
tured our organizat ion, enhanced our management base 
by structural reforms, and strengthened the capabilities of 
each of our divisions based on our past experience of over-
coming hardships. We are now poised on a new start line 
for growth with a range of human resour ces, technologies, 
expertise and know-how , and experience. Using these vi-tal assets, we will launch ourselves into an orbit of growth 
once again with c on/f_idence and courage.
It is clear what we should do. First, we must provide 
unique and advanced products. Second, we must pioneer 
and expand new markets in the emer ging economies, 
which are now leading the global economy . Third, we must 
/f_irmly establish our new businesses in the /f_ields of health-
care, including cosmetics and food supplements, pharma-
ceuticals, and functional materials.
To this end, we will focus our managerial and human 
resour ces on the growth /f_ields, thinking not only about 
what we should do, but also how and to what extent we 
should do it. In this regard it is vital that we continue to be 
concer ned about sustainability and introduce a process to 
achieve our goals and targets in an appropriate manner . We 
must incorporate the idea of sustainability into our man-
agement and implement it as the core of our management 
principles in a strategic manner as we move forwar d.
Taking on challenges in a bright and forward-
looking manner
The Fuji/f_ilm Group`s sales came to 2.18 trillion yen (US$ 
23.2 billion), and operating income befor e deducting the 
cost of structural reforms amounted to 101.6 billion yen 
(US$ 1.08 billion) in /f_iscal 2009. However , we actually regis-
tered a loss for the /f_iscal year because of costs, something 
that we had expected from the outset. From this /f_iscal year 
onwar d, we will strive to improve our management base to 
achieve an operating margin of 10% while making steady 
progress through structural reforms. We regard this year 
as a cornerstone to returning to growth and leading the 
industry in a range of /f_ields.
For us, sustainability has much to do with the promo-
tion of our management strategies. We will take on the chal-
lenge of doing our business in a bright and forwar d-looking 
manner by ful/f_illing our responsibilities to future genera-
tions including our responsibility for solving envir onmental 
problems and ful/f_illing our social role as a corporate citizen. 
Without this commitment, we cannot motivate ourselves 
or win the support of individuals, organizations, and other 
companies who ar e working with us or society at lar ge.The Fuji/f_ilm Group has clearly stated its target of reducing 
CO 2 emissions from its products throughout their lifecycles 
by 30% over /f_iscal 2005 levels by /f_iscal 2020. This is not an 
easy goal, but I believe we can achieve it by tackling chal-
lenges in a bright and forwar d-looking manner .
lOne for All,  All for Onez in creati ng new v alues
This spring I had a dialogue meeting with young managers 
who will be our future corporate leaders on the theme of 
leadership. At the meeting, I introduced to participants a 
principle widely accepted by rugby playerslOne for All, 
All for One,z because I want them to become leaders who 
can think about their company and society in their capac-
ity as public /f_igures and who can take action  not only for 
themselves but also for their subor dinates and colleagues, 
for the entire company , and for society at large. The prin-
ciple does not apply only to leaders. It also applies to all 
employees, each of whom I expect to work for their col-
leagues and the company and for society . If each mem-
ber takes action based on this principle, they will be able 
to create new values and contribute to the prosperity of 
the entire organization. That prosperity in turn will bene/f_it 
each employee. I have been repeating this idea continually 
through my messages in our sustainability reports. lOne for 
All, All for Onez in creating new values. This principle is es-
sential in ensuring sustainability . Each of us is now requir ed 
to implement that principle.

FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation Sustainability Report 2010 06Liquid cr ystal display (LCD) panels are used in a range of electronic products such as ﬂ at screen TVs,  PCs,  and cell 
phones. FUJIFILM has been supporting the popularization of LCD panels by supplying high-quality and highly functional 
LCD ﬁlms since the 1970s.
Activities in the Flat Panel Display Materials Business
 Part 1
Leading Progress in LCD Films through 
Advanced Quality Control and Appropriate Responses to Market Needs
Pursuit of beautiful pictures leading to the 
development of ﬁlms for most adv anced 
LCD panels
FUJIFILM manufactur es photographic /f_ilms by coating 
nearly 20 types of emulsion layers * evenly on a highly 
transpar ent base /f_ilm. We use a very unique and highly ad-
vanced technology to coat all the layers at the same time 
for higher productivity . Utilizing these advantageous pho-
tographic technologies, we have developed the optimum 
materials for /f_lat panel displays. Special /f_ilms developed by 
FUJIFILM are used in multiple numbers in the monitors of 
PCs and the incr easingly popular /f_lat-scr een LCD TVs.
FUJIFILM began providing LCD panel /f_ilms following 
the appearance of automatic LCD calculators on the mar-
ket, which contributed to the spread of LCDs in the lat-
ter half of the 1970s. Since then we have  been expanding 
the business with our Flat Panel Display Materials Division 
(FPD Materials Division) working to keep up with the prog-
ress of LCDs, including upsizing for use in liquid crystal 
monitors and notebook PCs, colorization, and the release 
and spr ead of LCD TVs.
Major LCD /f_ilms marketed by the FPD Materials 
Division include triacetylcellulose (TAC) /f_ilm to protect the 
polarizing plates indispensable for LCDs, wide-view (WV) 
/f_ilm that expands viewing angles, clean vivid (CV) antire/f_lec-
tive /f_ilm, and trunser /f_ilm for color /f_ilters to render colors. In 
particular , we have nearly an 80% share of the market for 
TAC /f_ilm and a 100% shar e of the market for WV /f_ilm.
FUJIFILM has received high evaluation for its LCD /f_ilm 
materials from /f_lat panel display manufactur ers by optimiz-
ing its product quali ty through the use of its advantageous 
photographic technologies, and by stabilizing supplies and 
developing and improving its products in close communi-
cation and cooperation with customers in prompt response 
to changes in market needs.
*  Composed of about 100 organic compounds with a thickness of 
around 15 micr ometers.Ensuring high quality and e xpanding 
production to become more competitive
TAC /f_ilm, which was traditionally used as photographic 
/f_ilm, began to attract attention as an LCD /f_ilm because the 
transpar ency is much higher than for /f_ilm made from other 
materials. An LCD panel is structur ed with multiple lay-
ers of a glass substrate, /f_ilters, and /f_ilm. For the backlight 
to permeate through the layers to project images on the 
screen effectively , it is necessary to use highly transpar ent 
materials for the layers. TAC /f_ilm is highly transpar ent but 
can contain /f_ine foreign matter because it is made from 
natural materials. At that time, however , FUJIFILM had al-
ready established a technique to remove the matter to a 
high degree, and so TAC /f_ilm made by the company was 
evaluated highly .
We also actively expanded the production capacity of 
our /f_ilms in response to customers` needs for larger /f_ilm for 
larger screens and the rapidly increasing demand, and the 
expansion has given us a competitive edge. A lot of differ-
ent materials go into the making of LCD panels and they 
could not be manufactur ed if any one of the materials is 
not in supply . The popularization of LCD panels would also 
be slowed down if panel manufactur ers could not respond 
promptly to incr eases in demand for the pr oduct.
Always recognizing its responsibilities as a supplier , 
FUJIFILM has been expanding its production system to 
supply the necessary /f_ilms to LCD panel manufactur ers in 
response to their needs and the trend in global demand 
since the initial spread of LCD panels. We have won the 
trust of our customers by ensuring a stable supply of these 
/f_ilms even when demand 
increased sharply , and 
are now enjoying a top 
share of the market.Producing T AC ﬁlm intensively in Japan and 
supplying it to the world to meet increasing 
demand
Due to the upsizing and rapid spread of LCD TVs, ship-
ments of LCD panels has been increasing continuously at a 
high rate of at least 20% per year in recent years. The world 
penetration rate of LCD TVs, however , is still at around 
30%. The use of the panels is expanding and will further 
expand into new markets in the BRICs and other emer g-
ing economies. Now large LCDs are also increasingly be-
ing used for digital signage. FUJIFILM will meet customer 
needs in a timely way while ensuring a stable supply of 
LCD /f_ilms in r esponse to incr easing demand.
Manufactur e of the core products of the FPD Materials 
Division, including TAC /f_ilm and highly functional WV and 
CV /f_ilms made base d on TAC /f_ilm, requir es extremely ad-
vanced production technologies and strict quality contr ol, 
and we therefore manufactur e all the /f_ilms in our three fac-
tories in Japan (FUJIFILM Kanagawa Factory , FUJIFILM 
Opto Materials, and FUJIFILM Kyushu) and ship the prod-ucts both within and outside Japan. There is still enough 
room to expand production capacity at FUJIFILM Kyushu, 
which has a large site, and we will continue to make the ap-
propriate equipment investments in response to increases 
in demand.
Integrating marketing,  development,  and 
production and further strengthening relations with customers
For LCD materials, which are industrial materials, it is criti-
cal to develop products in cooperation with customers, 
who are the polarizing plate and LCD panel manufactur -
ers. The FPD Materials Division has been working to inte-
grate its business operations by sharing information and 
problems among the marketing, production, R&D, and pro-
duction technology staff through regular meetings. We will 
continue to develop and manufactur e products in prompt 
response to customer needs in the rapidly changing IT and 
TV markets, thereby helping spread LCDs and supporting 
the gr owth of our own busines s.

Compar ed with cathode-ray tube (CRT) TVs, /f_lat-scr een 
TVs are lighter and more compact, not needing much 
space for installation. These TVs are also more envir on-
mentally friendly because they ar e mor e ener gy ef /f_icient.
In particular an LCD TV consumes 30% less electricity 
than a CRT TV of the same size. The energy conserved by 
all LCD TVs sold in the world in 2009 comes to 6.1 million 
tons-CO 2 when calculated based on the total area of LCDs 
shipped in the year. This amount is equivalent to the annual 
CO 2 emissions of about 1.21 million households of Japan.
Accor ding to the assessment of the envir onmental 
impact of TVs throughout their lifecycle from manufactur e 
and use to disposal, the electricity they consume in the 
use stage has a large environmental impact, and so replac-
ing CRT TVs with /f_lat-scr een ones will contribute greatly to 
protecting the envir onment.
Flat-scr een TVs began to be popularized on a wide 
scale in Japan around 2003 to 2004 and in 2010 the dif-
fusion rate reached 70% for households with at least two 
members (accor ding to a survey on consumption trends 
conducted by the Cabinet Of/f_ice of Japan). Also overseas, 
/f_lat-scr een TVs have become a mainstr eam product in the 
TV market. The use of these TVs expanded rapidly due to 
upsizing, lower prices, and improvements in image quality , Environmentally friendly procurement of materials
We use natural cellulose as a material for TAC, which 
serves as a base material for FUJIFILM`s LCD panel /f_ilms, 
such as TAC /f_ilm used to protect the polarizing plates, WV 
/f_ilm to expand the viewing angle, and CV /f_ilm to prevent 
screen re/f_lections. (Cellulose accounts for about 50% of 
the material in T AC.)
At present, it is particularly important to reduce global 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which cause global warm-
ing. On the other hand, trees are approved as carbon-neutral 
materials because they grow by absorbing CO 2, and the 
amount of CO 2 emitted when they are discar ded and incin-
erated can be offset by the amount previously absorbed by 
them. To highlight the fact that its LCD panel /f_ilms contrib-
ute to the mitigation of global warming, FUJIFILM acquir ed 
biomass product certi/f_ication for /f_ive of its product items 
including TAC /f_ilm from the Japan Organics Recycling 
Association in 2006.
Polarizing plate and LCD panel manufactur ers, who 
are our customers, are also committed to reduc ing the 
envir onmental impact of their products through green pur-
Cooperation between a manuf acturing site and  
a local community
FUJIFILM Kyushu (Kikuyo-machi, Kikuchi-gun, Kumamoto 
Prefecture) manufactures 50% or more of the Fuji/f_ilm 
Group`s LCD /f_ilms. The company has been actively com-
mitted to human exchanges and protecting the rich local 
natural environment in cooperation with local residents. In 
2010, as part of this effort, it participated in a team organ-
ized by Minami Aso Village to support paddy rice farmers.
Minami Aso Village is located in the south of Aso 
Caldera, one of the popular sightseeing spots in Kumamoto 
Prefectur e, and is adjacent to Kikuchi-gun, wher e FUJIFILM 
Kyushu is located. There are a lot of paddy /f_ields in the vil-
lage, but with the aging of the owner farmers and the lack 
of successors, it is becoming dif/f_icult for the farmers to 
maintain the /f_ields. The team to help the paddy farmers 
overcome their dif/f_iculties was organized by Minami Aso 
Village speci/f_ically to help them plant and harvest the rice. 
FUJIFILM Kyushu informed many employees of the team 
activity and about 50 employees joined the team this time.

* The data for thin-film transistor LCDs is used here.
Assumptions:  For the electricity consumed by LCDs, the average data shown for 
32-inch models in the energy conservation performance catalog for 
the summer of 2009 (published by the Japanese Agency for Natural Resources and Energy) was used to calculate the electricity consumed by thin-film transistor LCDs (based on the total area of LCDs shipped 
in the year). LCDs were assumed to consume 30% less electricity than 
CRT TVs of the same size.
Provision of information on chemical substances used 
in our products
As the functionality of LCDs increased, more chemical sub-
stances began to be added to LCD panel /f_ilms, which were 
initially made using natural materials. On the other hand, 
customers, such as the polarizing plate manufactur ers to 
whom we supply the /f_ilms, are increasingly committed to 
procuring materials and components that are both envir on-
mentally and socially friendly through green procurement 
and CSR-oriented procurement. In response, the Fuji/f_ilm 
Group has been str engthening its r elated measur es.
The national gover nment and industrial associations 
have their own regulations on chemical substances used in 
products, but in the past each supplier reported on their use 
to their customers in their own format. The use of different 
formats by suppliers, however , imposes a great burden on 
the supply chain in checking and managing the data, and 
so the FPD Materials Division decided to begin complying 
with the criteria of the Joint Article Management Promotion-
consortium (JAMP) in 2009. JAMP is an organization 
established by 17 Japanese companies including 
FUJIFILM in September 2006. The FPD Materials Division 
now also submits analysis certi/f_icates made by third-party 
organizations to the polarizing plate manufactur ers and 
other customers to increase the objectivity of its data on 
the substances used in its pr oducts.Submitting an analysis certiﬁcate created by a third-party organization

Activities in the Flat Panel Display Materials Business Part 1Comprehensive healthcare compan y that 
covers prevention,  diagnosis,  and treatment
The Fuji/f_ilm Group regards the healthcar e business as 
one of its important growth /f_ields. Our business provides 
products and services related to human health and living. 
Speci/f_ically , the Medical Systems Business Division of 
FUJIFILM focuses on diagnosis, the Life Science Products 
Division on prevention, Pharmaceutical Products Division 
and Toyama Chemical on prevention and treatment, and 
FUJIFILM RI Pharma, which deals with diagnostic radio-
pharmaceuticals, on diagnosis and treatment. We are thus 
using our unique technologies across the whole healthcar e 
/f_ield, covering maintenance of health, early detection of 
disease, and tr eatment.
FUJIFILM has been closely engaged in medical di-
agnosis since 1936, soon after the company`s inception, 
when it started to manufactur e /f_ilm for X-ray photography . 
Its technologies have advanced and expanded signi/f_icant-
ly, and now include digital X-ray imaging and diagnostic 
systems, endoscopes, and blood diagnostic systems. The 
company now provides hospitals with medical image infor-
mation networking systems so that they can share infor-
mation on the diagnosis and treatment of patients within 
their facilities. We have a top share of the market for these 
systems and our products are now being used as plat-
Medical Systems Business Pharmaceutical Products Business
Focusing on networking diagnostic devices 
with higher performanceContinuously e xpanding the system to develop 
and sell pharmaceuticals
The medical systems business is divided 
into the following four main areas: digital 
X-ray imaging and diagnostic systems, 
endoscopes, IT solutions, and blood diag-
nosis. In recent years, medical institutions 
have been managing their images and di-
agnostic information in an increasingly in-
tegrated manner , and the linking of the four 
areas is becoming an important theme in 
this /f_ield of business.
As the basis for information sharing, 
we provide customers with our SYNAPSE* 
X-ray image networking systems, which 
has been highly evaluated by customers. In order to respond to more advanced needs, 
we have expanded the range of images the 
system can handle to include 3D images, 
cardiovascular images, and endoscope im-
ages, while starting to provide a system that 
enables compr ehensive reviews of various 
screening images and diagnostic reports. 
We are encouraging the use of IT systems 
in medical facilities to enable them to man-
age compr ehensively a range of hospital in-
formation central to medical care and other 
operations, inclu ding medical records on 
treatment and screening. To further develop 
this part of our business, we established a Medical Systems Development Center by 
consolidating our development bases for 
various devices and systems.
*  Network system developed for radiography de-
partments to compr ehensively manage image 
information The life science business of the Fuji/f_ilm 
Group was substantially enhanced with 
the participation of Toyama Chemical in 
the Group in 2008, and our understanding 
of pharmaceutical technologies and busi-
ness was also greatly improved inside the 
Group. Engineers from FUJIFILM now also 
participate in the symposium held annually 
by Toyama Chemical, and there is active 
exchange between the R&D sites. Because 
of the syner gy effects inside the Group, we 
have been successfully developin g one or 
two new drugs every year and the develop-
ment of promising items, such as the T-705 anti-new in/f_luenza agent, is well underway .
In June 2009, FUJIFILM established 
its Drug Discovery Resear ch Laboratories. 
While Toyama Chemical specializes in 
anti-infective agents, the laboratories are 
engaged in R&D into anti-cancer agents 
focusing on diagnostic imaging and FTD* 
technology . Subsequently in November , we 
established FUJIFILM Pharma to begin the 
development and marketing of high value-
added generic drugs. In the future, we aim 
to develop this new company into a com-
prehensive pharmaceuticals company that 
also develops new drugs.*  FUJIFILM`s proprietary technology to formu-
late chemicals by mixing ingredients in a well-
balanced way and delivering them to targeted 
sites in the required formforms to link medical institutions and to support remote 
medical car e.
Using photographic ﬁlm technologies for 
pharmaceuticals and healthcare
In the area of prevention we provide food supplements 
for health maintenance and anti-aging as well as skincar e 
cosmetics, while in the area of treatment we develop and 
manufactur e radiopharmaceuticals, active pharmaceutical 
ingredients, and ethical drugs.
We are using a range of technologies built up through 
our development and manufactur e of photographic /f_ilms 
in the areas of prevention and treatment. For example the 
photosensitive layer in a photographic /f_ilm is made mainly 
from collagen, which is one of the proteins that form the 
components of human skin, bones, and ligaments. The 
technologies we developed for photographic /f_ilm can be 
applied to understanding the mechanisms of the human 
body to use collagen for human health. Nanotechnology , 
which is an essential technology for contr olling /f_ine par-
ticles, is used in the preparation of drugs, and anti- 
oxidation technology used to prevent the color of photo-
graphic prints from fading can be used to develop a tech-
nology to suppr ess active oxygen, which is said to cause 
aging and cancer .Enhanc ing quality of life for ever yone
The Fuji/f_ilm Group has unique technologies in the health-
care business, which gives us a competitive edge in the 
market. We can further strengthen our advantage by link-
ing the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment areas through 
cooperation between the divisions of FUJIFILM and other 
Group companies.
The Medical Systems Business Division and Fuji Xerox 
are now cooperat ing in the use of IT solutions to help hos-
pitals manage their businesses and raise the ef/f_iciency of 
their medical care services. We will help central hospitals 
and local clinics build effective medical systems through 
mutual cooperation by networking various types of medi-
cal facilities, and we can offer similar support services also 
to the emer ging economies. By combining endoscopes 
with pharmac euticals including diagnostic radiopharma-
ceuticals and antibody pharmaceuticals, we might be able 
to develop local therapy methods, which allows intensive 
treatment of only the affected part. These methods will 
help suppr ess the side effects of drugs while reducing the burdens imposed on patients.
The Fuji/f_ilm Group will continue with its activities in the 
healthcar e business to help people maintai n their health 
by providing them with supplements and other products. 
While developing new therapies, we will also help them 
improve the quality of their lives by increasing diagnostic 
precision and the ef /f_iciency of medical car e services.

focusing on specialized ar eas.
Toyama Chemical has achieved some 
great things and had a wealth of experience 
in the developing excellent antibiotic drugs 
and synthetic antibacterial agents, and has 
contributed signi/f_icantly to protecting peo-
ple from infectious diseases. At present, 
our T-705 anti-/f_lu virus agent is attracting 
attention from all over the world, and might 
provide a new option for in/f_luenza treatment 
based on a new mechanism. We are also 
engaged in developing CNS and cardio- 
vascular agents and anti-in/f_lammatory 
agents in addition to anti-infective agents. 
The promising products we are developing include T-817 MA, an agent for the treat-
ment of Alzheimer`s disease, for which 
there is no effective drug available now, and 
T-5224, which is expected to be useful in 
the primary tr eatm ent of rheumatism.
As a core company in Fuji/f_ilm Group`s 
healthcar e business focusing on treatment, 
Toyama Chemical is now enhancing its 
R&D and production technologies using 
the managerial resour ces possessed by the 
Group to build a system that can produce 
a stable supply of compounds that can be 
used for new drugs on a global scale. We 
will ful/f_ill our corporate responsibilities as a 
pharmaceutical  company by contributing to the promotion of global health care through 
new drug development.

In recent years, along with an increase 
in the volume of information with the prog-
ress of IT and also with the increase in de-
mand for medical services in our aging so-
ciety, there have been changes in people`s 
ideas about medical services and pharma-

diversi/f_ied. However , there are still needs that are not being met in the medical /f_ield, 
including needs center ed around cance r 
and dementia, and expectations for more 
innovative drugs ar e becoming str onger .
The gover nment, however , is on a tight 
budget and is implementing measur es to 
reduce medical and pharmaceutical costs 
one after another . As a result, the pharma-
ceutical industry is facing an increasingly 
sever e envir onment. To overcome the hard-
ships, pharmaceutical companies are being 
forced to change by streamlinin g their man-

Reducing the environmental impact of 
pharmaceuticals throughout their lifec ycles 
and ensuring highly reliable production management in compliance with cGMP
Pharmaceutical companies consume various chemicals, 
materials, energy, and water in their business activities, in-
cluding R&D, production, sales, transportation, and use of 
products.
Toyama Chemical acquir ed ISO 14001 certi/f_ication for 
its Toyama Works, its R&D and production base in Toyama 
City, in 2000. The company expanded the range of this 
certi/f_ication to the entire company in 2006, including its 
head of/f_ice (Tokyo). Toyama Chemical is committed to ful-
/f_illing its CSR by reducing the envir onmental impact of its

Activities in the Healthcare Business Part 2Developing,  manuf acturing,  and selling radiopharmaceuticals effective 
for the diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer`s  (FUJIFILM RI Pharma)Participating in the Pink Ribbon Campaign to raise breast cancer 
awareness in Europe and Asia too (medical systems business)CASE 2 CASE 3
Using radiopharmaceuticals in the early 
diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer`s 
Nuclear medicine is a medical specialty that uses radio-
pharmaceuticals to diagnose and treat diseases without im-
posing physical burden on patients. Radiopharmaceuticals 
contain radioactive materials (radioisotope, RI) and emit 
radiation. With the use of radiation, a variety of diseases 
can be diagnosed and tr eated.
In nuclear scanning, *1 a gamma camera is used to 
detect and image the movement of radiopharmaceuticals 
administer ed to the patient from outside the body , and the  
images are used to make diagnoses (SPECT *2 scanning). 
In this /f_ield, FUJIFILM RI Pharma can contribute to higher 
ef/f_iciency of scanning and precise diagnosis by combining 
its own technologies with the image processing and preci-
sion optics technologies built up within the Fuji/f_ilm Group 
over many years.
The image below shows an example of SPECT scan-
ning performed using radiopharmaceuticals supplied by 
FUJIFILM RI Pharma. Using SPECT scanning, doctors can 
check for any reduction in cerebral blood /f_low and iden-
tify the affected area. Diagnosis of early dementia and mild 
cognitive impairment that cannot be diagnosed only from 
physical symptoms such as memory loss is possible.Ensuring a stable supply while ensuring safety in manuf acturing and environmental 
protection
Radiopharmaceuticals have very short shelf-lives due to 
the featur es of RIs used in their manufactur e. The core 
products of FUJIFILM RI Pharma, which are used in the 
diagnosis of brain, heart, and bone diseases, are effec-
tive only within 30 hours of manufactur e. The company`s 
factory in Chiba manufactur es these products every day 
on requests from medical institutions and delivers them to 
users across the country the next morning, choosing an 
appropriate transportation route for the region and effec-
tively combining truck and air transportation. The factory 
has established a system that can receive orders 24 hours 
a day and has distribution centers near Haneda and Itami 
Airports, wher e some products are stored to respond to 
urgent or ders.
Radiopharmaceuticals are manufactur ed using radio-
active substances and so the company is strict in ensuring 
the safe handling of RIs and other substances to protect 
not only its manufacturing staff but also transporters from 
radiation exposur e. The company also ensur es that all is 
safe for local residents and local envir onment. For exam-
ple, wastewater from RI-related manufacturing processes 
is not dischar ged out of 
the factory .
To protect employ-
ees engaged in medical 
services from radiation 
exposur e when handling 
radiopharmaceuticals, 
FUJIFILM RI Pharma 
supplies most of its prod-
ucts pre/f_illed in syringes *3 
cover ed with protective 
shields.Increasing a wareness and understanding  
of breast cancer care in cooperation with  
a leading drugstore (United Kingdom)
FUJIFILM UK Ltd. ships special pink digital camera kits to 
Boots, a leading drugstor e that focuses its effort on breast 
cancer care. The camera kits are sold at Boots` outlets 
for a limited period, and FUJIFILM UK donates part of the 
sales (/f_ive pounds per camera) to an NPO for breast cancer 
care (http://www .breastcancer care.org.uk/).
A message saying that /f_ive pounds will be donated 
when the product is sold is written on each of the packag-
ing boxes which are specially designed for the camera kits, 
and this helps raise the awar eness and understanding of 
breast cancer car e of female buyers of the camera kits.
Conducting a wareness-raising activities  
in addition to giving technological support 
to mammography screening (China)
We have been providing technological support for the Pink 
Ribbon activities in China mainly by leasing the FCR mam-
mography system to local medical institutions and uni-
versities and helping radiation technologists and doctors 
improve the quality of their breast cancer screening skills. 
In order to communicate the importance of breast cancer 
screening to more women, we also held an event with jour-
nalists in Octo ber 2009 at which we gave commendations 
to 11 women who had made contributions to the preven-
tion and treatment of breast cancer , and announced an 
initiative to be taken in cooperation with Beijing Tian Tan 
Hospital. In the initiative, we agreed to send free-of-char ge 
breast cancer screening tickets for 100 women to the rele-
vant gover nmental agency located in Beijing and distribute 
1,000 copies of the DVD introducing information on breast 
cancer prevention through the Pink Ribbon information 
sharing website for Chinese people. Education on the importance of breast

Sales of digital cameras are greatly e xpanding in the emerging economies while demand for high v alue-added 
products is also increasing.  We are selling entr y models in the emerging economies and also making efforts to impro ve 
our brand power by pro viding unique and high v alue-added products.
We are visualizing CO 2 emitted throughout the lifec ycles of thermal CTP plates for offset printing and

tems business.
FUJIFILM Yoshida-Minami Factory , wher e PS plates 
are manufactur ed, has been doing closed-loop recycling 
by reusing scrap aluminum from the manufactur e of PS 
plates to reduce CO 2 emissions in the procurement stage 
of the material since 2007.
In the closed-loop recycling system, the factory reuses 
scrap aluminum for PS plates, keeping the purity as high as 
for virgin aluminum (99.5% or higher) in cooperation with 
the aluminum alloy and aluminum rolling companies. With 
the introduction of this system, the factory reduced its CO 2 
emissions by 120,000 tons in total over the period from 
2007 to Mar ch 2010.

such as the BRICs
FUJIFILM is rapidly increasing the 
sales of its digital cameras by de-
veloping entry models and selling 
them widely in emer ging econo-
mies such as the BRICs. We have 
achieved substantial cost reduc-
tions for these entry models by 
focusing on basic functions. Moreover , we are expanding 
the marke t by pr oviding a variety of localized models.
In Brazil, we began knockdown production in part-
nership with a local manufactur er to establish a system to 
respond promptly to local market needs and changes. As 
a result, sales quantities in emer ging economies including 
the BRICs increased by 1.5 times compar ed with the previ-
ous year .
FUJIFILM FinePix REAL 3D System*1 
developed for capturing,  viewing,  and 
printing 3D images
FUJIFILM is committed to developing digital cameras that 
allow anyone to easily take pictur es of subjects just as 
they appear , and has been providing a range of high value-
added products to the market by the use of its proprietary 
technologies for lenses, CCDs, and image processing 
technologies.Indicating the carbon footprint of products
FUJIFILM has been proactively particip ating*3 in the pilot 
project on carbon footprint promoted by the Japanese 
Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry with the aim of 
contributing to higher envir onmental awar eness in the 
printing industry .
As a result, we obtained approval from the Ministry 
to show the carbon footprint of our aluminum-based ther-
mal CTP plates, and now the plate`s carbon footprint is 
indicated on its packaging, as shown below . The image 
development system for the ECONEX XP-F thermal CTP 
plate has achieved the world`s lowest generation levels of 
wastewater , and compar ed with FUJIFILM`s conventional 
product (the HP-F thermal CTP plate), the amount of devel-
oping solution r e/f_illed can be r educed by up to 40%.

through LC A
Reusing scrap aluminum for PS plates*4
The Fuji/f_ilm Group identi/f_ied the entire Group`s envir on-
mental impact through LCA*5 and in April 2010 set a target 
of reducing the CO 2 emitted throughout the lifecycles of 
its products by 30% from /f_iscal 2005 levels by /f_iscal 2020. 
As a result of converting the envir onmental impact that the 
materials and components used in the Group`s products 
would have throughout their lifecycles to CO 2 emissions, 
the following fact was revealed: the impact is highest in 
the procurement stage (see page 30) and in particular , the 
aluminum used for PS plates has a large envir onmental 
impact.*6 In response, we have been trying to reduce the The FinePix REAL 3D W1, which was released in August 
2009, incorporates 3D technology and is the /f_irst innova-
tive camera in the world with which you can captur e and 
record 3D images. Using the FinePix REAL 3D V1 viewer ,*2 
you can enjoy watching 3D still and animated images on a 
screen larger than the camera LCD without wearing special 
3D glasses. We also began a FUJIFILM 3D printing ser-
vice,*3 which enables users  to store the 3D images cap-
tured by the camera as photo prints.
While further improving our technologies and services 
for 3D images, we are also cooperating with other manu-
factur ers that have 3D products. In April 2010, we released 
our HDP-L1 player , which enables users to watch 3D im-
ages captur ed with the FinePix REAL 3D W1 on a 3D TV . 
FUJIFILM will continue to develop and resear ch 3D 
technolog ies to provide society with products and services 
that will ultimately enable users to captur e images of sub-
jects as they actually appear .

 Part 5
Creating More Value for Customers under the 
concept “Come and Encounter for Innovation”
Searching for a new means of 
communication via documents
Fuji Xerox has been renovating its means of communicat-
ing information and contributing to the dramatic progress 
of communication since it released the /f_irst Xerography-
based plain paper copier in 1962. Even now, communica-
tion by documents plays an important and indispensable 
role in corporate activities.
Thus Fuji Xerox believes that it can help customers 
/f_ind solutions to their increasingly dif/f_icult management 
problems by providing them with new value in communi-
cation and with documentation services.
Fuji Xerox R&D Squar e is a progressive and innova-
tive place wher e a range of knowledge and technologies is 
concentrated. Here, Fuji Xerox can tackle challenges, de-
velop solutions, and create new value through a customer -
oriented viewp oint. 
Concept of new R&D from the customers` viewpoint
As customers expand their business operations on a glob-
al scale, they face more complex management challenges 
with limited time to solve those challenges.
To help them overcome these dif/f_iculties, we opened 
an urban R&D base wher e people, information, and things 
are exchanged dynamically , under the key concept of 
lCome and Encounter for Innovati on.z
Listening to our customers` speci/f_ic management 
challenges, Fuji Xerox conducts R&D at the base in part-
nership with resear ch institutions and other companies, 
thereby fostering new , even mor e practical R&D.R&D Square as a base to create new v alue
Fuji Xerox concentrated its R&D bases in the following two 
sites: the R&D Squar e (for value creation) and the Ebina 
Center (for manufacturing).
The R&D Squar e, which is designed for value creation, 
is located in the Minato Mirai 21 district of Yokohama, near 
the center of Tokyo. There are a number of universities in 
its vicinity , and is also near Haneda Airport, one of Japan`s 
gateways to Asia. With a long history as an international 
port, the city is expected to achieve further growth in a 
dynamic manner . We will 
energetically foster R&D 
in this location in open 
partnership with other 
companies, universities, 
and r esear ch institutions.

ʫʫ  Recycling site in China certiﬁed by the Chinese go vernment 
as a model remanuf acturing enterprise for electric productsIn order to respond more speedily and ef/f_iciently to the 
rapidly changing business envir onment and also to en-
hance its corporate structur e, on January 29, Fuji Xerox 
restructur ed and integra ted its dispersed development and 
production functions into two new companies: Fuji Xerox 
Advanced Technology and Fuji Xerox Manufacturing and 
the new companies started operations on April 1.
By establishing these subsidiaries, Fuji Xerox acceler -
ates its growth in new business /f_ields such as the service 
and solution businesses, and transform its management 
structur e into one that is mor e cost-compe titive.
Fuji Xerox Advanced Technology integrated the de-
velopment functions of Fuji Xerox Engineering which is 
engaged in the development of copiers and printers on 
commission and part of the development functions of 
Fuji Xerox, and the hardwar e and softwar e development 
functions of Niigata Fuji Xerox Manufacturing, Suzuka Fuji 
Xerox, and Fuji Xerox Information System. Accor dingly , 
the development  department of Fuji Xerox is now concen-
trating on the development of products as well as of its 
platform, marking and other new technologies, while Fuji 
Xerox Advanced Technology is developing technologies 
for image reading and paper feeding while engaging in the 
development of modules such as peripheral devices. It also fosters customized developments to meet customers` 
needs in a pr ompt manner .
Fuji Xerox Manufacturing integrated the production 
functions of Fuji Xerox Takematsu Center which manu-
factur es pulverized toners and photor eceptors, Fuji Xerox 
Imaging Materials which produces EA toners, Suzuka Fuji 
Xerox which manufactur es electr onic parts and key parts 
for optical devices, and Niigata Fuji Xerox Manufacturing 
which manufactur es printers.
Fuji Xerox Eco-Manufacturing (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., a recy-
cling site wholly owned by Fuji Xerox, was certi/f_ied as 
a model remanufacturing enterprise for electric prod-
ucts by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information 
Technology. As part of its environmental policies, the 
Chinese government launched this certi/f_ication program 
to promote the development of the remanufacturing in-
dustry and to build a society dedicated to energy con-
servation and environmental protection. In the program, 
the government certi/f_ies industry-leading companies as 
model remanufacturing enterprises, aiming to foster the 
development of environment-friendly companies. Out of 
35 companies certi/f_ied this time, including three IT equip-
ment companies, Fuji Xerox Eco-Manufacturing (Suzhou) 
is the only Japanese-based company.
Fuji Xerox Eco-Manufacturing (Suzhou)  completely 
disassembles, sorts, and recycles used products including 
copiers, multifunction devices, and cartridges recover ed 
by Fuji Xerox (China) from all over China (excluding Hong 
Kong, Macao and Taiwan). This recycling company started 
operation in January 2008. It has the capacity to disas-
semble and recycle 15,000 devices and 500,000 cartridges 
per year, and had achieved a device recycling rate of more 
than 98% as of Mar ch 2010.As a responsible manufactur er, Fuji Xerox aims to achieve 
zero land/f_ill, no pollution, and no illegal disposal, and the 
certi/f_ication by the Chinese gover nment demonstrates 
that the company`s efforts are understood and valued in 
China. Prior to the establishment of the recycling system in 
China, Fuji Xerox built a recycling system for zero land/f_ill, 
no pollution , and no illegal disposal in Japan in 1995 and in 
the Asia-Paci/f_ic region in 2004. The recycling site in China 
also received the Monozukuri , Special Envir onment Award

 Part 6
The Fujiﬁlm Group is focusing on a wareness raising and cultural reform and v aluing the development of  
management (core) and global human resources across the Group .
New Challenges for the Development and 
Exchange of Human Resources
New challenges for human resources 
development and e xchange
In personnel affairs, FUJIFILM Holdings gives /f_irst prior-
ity to awar eness raising and the development of manage-
ment (core) and global human resour ces across the Fuji/f_ilm 
Group, based on its new management plan for 2014, when 
the Group will celebrate the 80th anniversary of its foun-
dation. In /f_iscal 2009, we set the medium-term strategies  
for human resour ces and are now implementing speci/f_ic 
measur es based on those strategies.
In awar eness raising and cultural reform, we have 
been planning and holding an overnight Seminar for 
Leaders (part II) since two years ago, targeting about 220 
departmental managers who will lead FUJIFILM and Fuji 
Xerox into the future. For middle-ranking managers, we 
expanded the range of the syner gy training  for FUJIFILM 
and Fuji Xerox leaders, which we held seven times in /f_iscal 
2008. In /f_iscal 2009, we gave this training speci/f_ically to 
144 middle-ranking managers as an opportunity to create 
syner gies within the Fuji/f_ilm Group and raise their leader -
ship awar eness.
In the development of management (core) and global 
human resour ces, members who are in charge of personnel 
affairs at FUJIFILM and Fuji Xeroxtwo operating compa-
nies within the Groupr egularly meet to frankly exchange 
opinions and discuss speci/f_ic measur es for the mutual 
exchange and assignment of human resour ces towar d 
further growth of the Fuji/f_ilm Group. Also to expand busi-
ness in markets in emer ging economies, the two compa-
nies recruited human resour ces internally across the Group 
and had more than the expected number of applicat ions 
for those jobs. Employees are becoming increasingly in-
terested in the development and use of human resour ces 
in the Gr oup.
FUJIFILM Holdings was established with certain mis-
sions, one of which was to enable the Fuji/f_ilm Group to 
create more syner gy by utilizing its human assets /f_lex-
ibly across the Group for the creation of new business. 
However there is no lmiracle drugz available to achieve this 
target, and we must constantly provide Group employees 
with a range of educational opportunities and encourage 
them to have higher motivation and passion. FUJIFILM 
Holdings will continue to take on the challenge of achieving more speci/f_ic results on higher levels in human resour ce 
development, based on trust and cooperation among the 
members of the Gr oup.On June 4, 2010, the Personnel Division of FUJIFILM 
Holdings held a human exchange meeting between 
FUJIFILM (FF) and Fuji Xerox (FX). These two companies 
are exchanging human resour ces to achieve the Fuji/f_ilm 
Group`s new medium-term management plan by making a 
concerted ef fort using their r espective business featur es.
Since the establishment of FUJIFILM Holdings three 
years and nine months ago, huma n resour ces have been 
gradually but steadily exchanged between FF and FX to-
ward the cr eation of new business.
The meeting was held for members with diversi/f_ied 
job experience and expertise to frankly exchange opinions 
about the perceived differences between the two com-
panies, points to be improved in the future, and possible 
syner gies.  
Participants in the meeting
Topics of the meeting
Differences b etween FF and FX
With regard to the differences, the following opinions were 
expressed at the meeting: FX seems to have success-
fully established a systematic operating process for its 
one trillion-yen business, while at FF, business operations 
are conducted in a dynamic manner by empower ed indi-
viduals. These featur es 
themselves are very sig-
ni/f_icant and useful, and 
through mutual supple-
ment and learning, the 
two companies will gain 
more merits. Expectations for  
syner gy cr eation
From the viewpoint of 
human resour ce de-
velopment, one par-
ticipant said that through FX`s internal recruitment system 
launched for young and middle-level employees this /f_iscal 
year, employees of FX were able to transfer the expertise 
they had accumulated at the company to FF, which in turn 
helped them grow, expand their possibilities, and become 
more motivated. Another participant said, lWe were initially 
a bit suspicious about the exchange of human resour ces 
between FF and FX, but in fact we were able to learn a lot 
through the exchange and now have mutual respect for 
each other .z The opinion was also expressed that the re-
sources of the two companies (technologies, information 
and business details) must be made more accessible to 
employees of both companies to make them more awar e 
of the merits of cooperation.
In overseas markets in particular , the companies might 
win greater business chances by reexamining their technol-
ogy, business, and marketing systems for gr eater syner gy.
Expectations for the futur e
All participants agreed that the exchange of human resourc-
es is now on a slightly higher level than initially, and needs 
to advance further and expand to include a wider range of 
employees, not only limited to general employees but also 
senior managers who are close to top management.
Lessons from the meeting
Participants in the meeting expressed very speci/f_ic opin-
ions and talked about how they experienced hardships, 
identi/f_ied problems, and made responses and efforts to 
deal with problems. They were indeed strongly commit-
ted to devoting themselves to corporate growth, thinking 
how both FF and FX could take advantage of the Group`s 
strength and win market competition.
We are now in an increasingly informatized society and a 
key to beating our competitors is to increase the synergy ef-
fects of the two companies by 
effectively integrating the busi-
ness models of the companies 
to create new ones. To this 
end, it is critical for the com-
panies to exchange human 
resources, for which proactive 
measures will be devised and 
implemented. It is also crucial 
for each and every employee 
to become more motivated 
and committed.Kouichi Suematsu

Shen Quan (1682 to ?) was a professional Chinese painter during the Qing 
Dynasty. Shen, born in the province of Zhejiang, came to Nagasaki, Japan in 
1731. He was known for his graphic and dense depictions of /f_lowers and birds, 
and his painting style spread across Japan through his disciple Yuhi and the 
disciples of Yuhi, having great in/f_luence on painters in the country in and after 
the middle of the Edo period. The two paintings above, exquisitely and vividly 
depicting /f_lower and trees, were still in a set of 11 hanging scrolls at the end of 
the Edo period.CSR Highlights 2009
Conducting CSR Activities in Linkage with 
the New Management Plan, Supporting  
the Achievement of Management TargetsThe Fujifilm Group’s CSR and medium-term CSR plan
Supporting the achievement of 
management targets through  
well-established CSR activities
It is already three years since the Fuji/f_ilm Group shifted 
to a holding company structur e in October 2006. During 
those three years, we have been endeavoring to become a 
corporate group that is really useful to society by strength-
ening our strategic management and gover nance systems 
across the Group, with FUJIFILM Holdings leading the  
efforts.In /f_iscal 2009, FUJIFILM Holdings examined the 
Groupʼs past CSR activities based on the results of 
reviewing the medium-term CSR plan (for /f_iscal 2007 to 
2009) to identify what activities were particularly important 
for the Group. The company also set the V80-CSR Strategy 
as the Groupʼs next medium-term CSR plan, resetting the 
direction and priority issues of its CSR activities, in light of 
the present situation, challenges, and aspirations for the 
future. Based on this, the new management plan for 2014, 
when the Group will celebrate its 80th anniversary , was 
formulated.
The V80-CSR Strategy is composed of the following 
four CSR promotional policies: strengthening the organiza-
tional basis; enhancing human resour ces; providing envi-
ronmentally friendly products and services for higher QOL; 
and developing business from stakeholdersʼ viewpoints 
(see page 29).From /f_iscal 2010 onwar ds, the Fuji/f_ilm Group will link 
its CSR activities with the new management plan and move 
forwar d to a stage in which the achievement of manage-
ment targets will be supported through a well-established 
CSR activity system. For the Fuji/f_ilm Groupʼs history and 
CSR activities after the shift to a holding company struc-
ture, please see the illustration on the left.

The following table shows our self evaluation of the progress made over the past three years in the implementation of the 
medium-term CSR plan (for /f_iscal 2007 to 2009).Reviewing the results of the medium-term CSR plan  
(for ﬁscal 2007 to 2009)
We were able to achieve the priority targets set in the 
medium-term CSR plan almo st as planned, except for the 
enhancement of anti-global warming measur es and the 
internal auditing system. (The measur es and the system 
were not enhanced as planned because of the recent eco-
nomic downtur n.) The review , however , also revealed that 
the achievement of the priority targets did not contribute 
suf/f_iciently to achieving our management tar gets.
Next medium-term CSR plan V80-CSR Strateg y
In /f_iscal 2009, we formulated our next medium-term CSR 
plan V80-CSR Strategy by resetting the direction of our 
CSR activities and priority CSR targets through a review 
of the medium-term CSR plan (for /f_iscal 2007 to 2009) (as 
described above) and the new Management Plan towar d 
the 80th anniversary in 2014, based on our perceptions of 
the present situation and challenges and our aspirations 
for the fut ure. 
In /f_iscal 2010 onwar ds, the Fuji/f_ilm Group will move 
forwar d to a stage in which the achievement of its manage-
ment targets will be supported through its well-established 
CSR activities to be conducted in linkage with the new management plan and business operations. To this end, 
the V80-CSR Strategy is composed of CSR promotion pol-
icies, priority issues, major measur es and key performance 
indicators (KPI) and will be implemented from /f_iscal 2010 
to 2012.
Identifying materiality
The Fuji/f_ilm Group decides the materiality of its priority 
CSR issues based on the following two criteria: (1) in/f_lu-
ence on the Fuji/f_ilm Group, and (2) exter nal evaluation of 
the group measur es. The /f_igure below shows the material-

FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation Sustainability Report 2010 28 29 FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation Sustainability Report 2010The Fujifilm Group’s CSR and medium-term CSR planThe Fujiﬁlm Group`s new long-term target
In April 2010, the Fuji/f_ilm Group set a long-term target of 
reducing its lifecycle CO 2 emissions by 30% (from the /f_is-
cal 2005 level) by /f_iscal 2020. Accor dingly , we will work to 
reduce total CO 2 emissions from both our business opera-
tions and from our products and services throughout their 
lifecycles (from the procurement of materials to manufac-
ture, transpo rt, use, and disposal and r ecycling).
The following /f_igures show the Group`s products` and 
services` lifecycle CO 2 emissions in /f_iscal 2005 (baselines 
year; r esults) and in /f_iscal 2020 (tar get year; tar get values).
We will reduce global CO 2 emissions from our busi-
ness activities from about /f_ive million tons in /f_iscal 2005 
to about 3.5 million tons in /f_iscal 2020, by further promot-
ing Design for Envir onment and by strengthening energy-
saving activities at of /f_ices and factories.Also in a range of business /f_ields in which the Fuji/f_ilm 
Group is engaged in and at its production and sales bases 
located across the world, localized measur es will be imple-
mented that take the local business featur es into account. 
The following table shows our major CO 2 emissions reduc-
tion measur es.
CO2 emissions in ﬁscal 20 09  
(from products and ser vices throughout their lifec ycles)
In /f_iscal 2009, we reduced our lifecycle CO 2 emissions by 
a total of about 730,000 tons compar ed with /f_iscal 2008 
due to the recycling of aluminum in the graphic systems 
business (in the procurement stage), conversion of fuel to 
natural gas (in the manufactur e stage), and also due to the 
release of ener gy-saving pr oducts (in the use stage).Total CO 2 emissions and per -unit CO 2 emissions  
from the six major chemical f actories in Japan*
In /f_iscal 2009, our production amount increased by 10% 
from the /f_iscal 2008 level, but CO 2 emissions decreased 
by 3% (equivalent to about 22,000 tons). This is mainly 
attributable to the conversion of all fuel to natural gas 
at FUJIFILM Opto Materials and FUJIFILM Kanagawa 
Factory`s Ashigara Site and also to the implementation of a 
range of energy-saving measur es, including the recovery of 
waste heat from the distillation tower and the recovery and 
reuse of /f_lash steam at the /f_lat panel production facilities. 
In /f_iscal 2012, our production amount will increase from the 
/f_iscal 2009 level but our CO 2 emissions will be kept below 
the /f_iscal 2009 level, with per-unit CO 2 emissions kept at 
around 60% (of the /f_iscal 1990 level, as shown in the /f_igure 
on the right).
*  CO 2 emissions from the six major chemical factories in Japan (FUJIFILM 
Kanagawa Factory`s Ashigara and Odawara Sites, FUJIFILM Fujinoiya 
and Yoshida-Minami Factories, FUJIFILM Opto Materials Co., Ltd., 
and FUJIFILM Kyushu Co., Ltd.) account for 57% of the total emis-
sions from the entire Fuji/f_ilm Group (including the Fuji Xerox Group 
and T oyama Chemical).Reducing Lifecycle CO 2 Emissions by 30%

FUJIFILM.FUJIFILM Kyushu (in Kikuyo Town, Kumamoto Prefectur e) 
derives heat and electricity necessary for the entire factory 
from the highly ef/f_icient private power generation facilities 
operated by an energy supplier . At the municipal hot spring 
facilities adjacent to the factory , kerosene boilers were used 
to heat the hot spring water . The factory began supplying 
its surplus heat to the hot spring facilities in April 2010, 
expecting that this would help the facilities reduce its use 
of fuel, which would in turn lead to the reduction of CO 2 
emissions fr om the facilities by about 320 tons annually .
With regard to the heat supply , FUJIFILM and Kikuyo 
Town concluded an emission credit transfer agreement 
under the Japanese emission credit system in December 
2009. As a result, the company can contribute to the town`s Supply of heat to the hot spring f acilities (from April 2010)

implemented measur es to increase the energy ef/f_iciency of 
its manufacturing process by proactively introducing energy-
saving technologies (mainly through the three initiatives FUJIFILM Manufacturing U.S.A., Inc. (South Carolina) has 
been using methane gas generated from the neighbor -
hood land/f_ill site as fuel since May 2009. The supply and 
concentration of methane gas vary depending upon vari-
ous envir onmental conditions and complex ecosystems, 
such as under ground gas accumulation, and the supply 
and concentration are therefore unstable compar ed with 
natural gas, but improvements will be made to stabilize this 
supply thanks to cooperation from the gas supplier and 
the company managing the land/f_ill site. This /f_iscal year, the 
supply amount was a bit lower than planned but the use of 
methane, a substance that contributes to global warming 
by about 21 times compar ed with CO 2 but produces more 
heat than kerosene and heavy oil, had a great effect both 
on the envir onment and the budget (as shown in the fol-
lowing table).
The project was highly evaluated for its contribution 
to local envir onmental conservation and the company re-
ceived many commendations for the project from the local 
gover nment and industry or ganizations.
FUJIFILM and its af/f_iliates in Japan have been engaged in 
the Ideas for Cool Earth (ICE) Project as FUJIFILM`s global 
corporate citizen activity to be conducted during the com-
mitment period (2008 to 2012) of the Kyoto Protocol for the 
promotion of anti-global warming measur es at of/f_ices and 
households.
At their of/f_ices, the companies are continuing awar e-
ness activities for energy conservation, including the lcool 
biz,z lwarm biz,z and llights offz activities while encouraging 
employees to take on the lICE Challengez to reduce their 
CO 2 emissions by one kilogram per day, as proposed in 
the Team Minus 6% project implemented by the Japanese 
Ministry of the Envir onment.
For details (and for activities conducted continuously 
in /f_iscal 2010), please see the following website. described below). Through its new energy conservation 
committee * established in April 2010, FOM is meticulously 
fostering energy-saving activities to achieve the target of 
reducing the entir e factory`s ener gy use by 5%.
*  The energy conservation committee is composed of the following two 
teams: (1) a steering team that proposes the FOM activity guidelines 
and (2) an ECOFOM team to conduct activities to increase the energy

thereby r educing annual CO 2 emissions by 900 tons.
FOM will implement additional measur es to increase

system also to other lines to further increase the energy 
ef/f_iciency of the factory .
*1.  FUJIFILM`s organiza tion which develops and designs energy-
ef/f_icient equipment
*2.  The important technological point of this system is to recover 
steam at atmospheric pressur e so as not to impact the manu-
facturing process and then raise its pressur e to ensur e the 
stable mixing of the recover ed steam with pressurized steam 
supplied fr om the boiler .FOM recovers and reuses almost 100% of the solvent used 
in the manufact ure of TAC /f_ilms to minimize the emissions 
of chemical substances into the air. A lot of energy, how-
ever, is used to recover and reuse the solvent, and it is a 
great challenge for the company to reduce the energy used 
in the solvent r ecovery pr ocess.
To meet this challenge, FOM is planning to deploy 
technology proven to be effective for CO 2 emissions re-
duction at the FUJIFILM Kanagawa Factory and FUJIFILM 
Kyushu,*3 with a view to reducing its CO 2 emissions by at 
least 4,000 tons a year .
*3.  Refers to the innovative process technology to achieve both en-
vironmental improvement and energy conservation developed 
by the Production Engineering & Development Center . This 
technology enables the ef/f_icient recovery of waste solvent by 
improving the cooling process and helps achieve a 20% to 40% 
reduction in energy use. By using this technology , FUJIFILM 
Kanagawa Factory and FUJIFILM Kyushu reduced their annual 
CO 2 emissions by 10,000 tons in total.
FOM has introduced an energy conservation support sys-
tem*4 to enable its process managers to centrally manage 
energy-related information. The managers can now check 
the changes in each facility`s energy use (electricity and 
steam) in graphs. Using  this system, they can visually 
compar e the energy used by similar facilities on the same 
screen and check for differences in their energy ef/f_iciency , 
which allows them to plan energy saving measur es with-
out taking much time for data collection and processing. 
Thanks to this, it has become possible for FOM to compar e 
and check energy loads in the wastewater treatment pro-
cess and make impr ovements  to related systems.

CSR Highlights 2009
Responses to the climate change problemFUJIFILM Holdings has been promoting eco-driving across 
Fuji/f_ilm Group companies in Japan since June 2008, aiming 
to improve fuel economy by 10%* and reduce CO 2 emis-
sions annually by about 2,560 tons. We will continue to 
implement a range of measur es to decrease the emissions, 
improve driving manners, and pr event traf /f_ic accidents.
* Estimation by the Ener gy Conservation Center , Japan
Fuji Xer ox has been operating its business with the goal of 
decreasing average power consumption per unit by half 
in 2005 against 1997 levels. As a way to con/f_irm the re-
sults, the company has been participating in the Energy 
Conservation Awards held by the Japanese Ministry 
of Economy , Trade and Industry (initially by the Energy 
Conservation Center , Japan) since 1999. The company re-
ceived an awar d from the Director-General of the Agency 
for Natural Resour ces and Energy at the /f_iscal 1999 (10th) 
competition, and since then it has been winning awar ds at 
the event consecutively for 11 years.
In /f_iscal 2009 in particular , Fuji Xerox won the awar d 
from the Minister of Economy , Trade and Industry , the 
highest prize in the Energy Conservation Awards, for the 
ApeosPort-IV/DocuCentre-IV C 5570/C 4470/C 3370/C 2270

The series has achieved the lowest TEC values* in the 
class and recovers from sleep mode in 10 seconds (for 
25/35 prints per minute), thereby substantially increasing 
convenience for customers as well as ener gy ef /f_iciency .

Fuji Xerox Osaka has 348 vehicles and has been proactively en-
gaged in the eco-driving campaign. In fiscal 2009, the number of vehicles increased by four vehicles and the annual running dis-tance increased by “475.6 km or 6.4% per car” per year due to the promotion of sales activities. Fuel economy, however, improved by 0.12 km per liter to 10.76 km, up 21% from fiscal 2006, when the eco-driving activity was started. The number of one-car accidents also decreased to 59.3% of the previous fiscal year’s level. In rec-ognition of these achievements, we received a prize from the chair -
man of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan at the eco-driving competition held by the Ministry of the Environment and the Agency.
We will continue to hold safe driving seminars and internal eco-
driving competitions in which our drivers can easily participate.VOICE

⾣Features of the introduced technologiesThe Fuji/f_ilm Group has been holding stakeholder dialogues 
since 2004. The dialogue meetings held focusing on envi-
ronmental protection, one of the CSR activities, provided 
us with the opportunity to summarize our ideas, identify 
and share problems, probe them, /f_ind solutions, and also 
to verify the solutions in an objective manner . In particular 
for anti-clima te change measur es, in response to the es-
tablishment of a global greenhouse gas emission reduc-
tion framework, Group employees and experts discussed 
from various viewpoints and agreed on the following: to 
improve the Group`s activities and expand them across the board, and to devise effective information disclosur e mea-
sures (disclosur e of speci/f_ic examples and visualization of 
the entire Group`s envir onmental impact through LCA, as 
detailed on pages 19, 30-34, 49, and 70).
In April 2010, the Fuji/f_ilm Group set the target of reduc-
ing lifecycle CO2 emissions from its products and services 
by 30% from the /f_iscal 2005 level by /f_iscal 2020, adopting 
the idea of reducing total lifecycle CO2 emissions. We were 
able to set the long-term target based on this idea as a 
result of repeated discussions at the dialogue meetings to 
narrow the gap between internal and external perceptions.
TOPIC
Participants at the dialogue meetingStakeholder Dialogue 2010
On May 12, 2010, we held Stakeholder Dialogue 2010 on 
the theme of anti-global warming measures, inviting external 
experts. Through the meeting, we aimed to raise awareness 
of employees about the Fuji/f_ilm Group`s long-term environ-
mental target established based on the new idea of reduc-
ing total lifecycle emissions and encourage them share the 
target and pursue it in their daily operations. At the meet-
ing, after an employee of FUJIFILM Holdings explained the 
long-term target, the activities of FUJIFILM and Fuji Xerox 
were outlined to participants. Then discussion began.
Participating exter nal experts highly evaluated the 
Fuji/f_ilm Group`s proactive anti-global warming measur es. 
They also expressed their expectations for the Group, in-
cluding cooperation with local communities and other 
companies, development of forwar d-looking measur es and 
business, creation of innovative businesses, promotion of 
measur es for the whole of society , and further education 
At the meeting, we continued intensive discussion for three hours 
without a break and differences in the focus of effective anti-global warming measures were identified between FUJIFILM and Fuji Xerox. The discussion confirmed for me the fact that if two companies having such differences are able to achieve the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% from the fiscal 2005 level by fiscal 2020, it shows that their products and services must actually be used by customers. I believe all participants were able to understand the importance of expand-ing environmental solutions through business. At the meeting I also made the following comments: specific measures seem to be just starting, there is room for more synergy effects between ʫʫ Comment on the stakeholder meeting on anti-global warming measuresVOICE

Formulating the polic y
In June 2009, FUJIFILM Holdings established the Fuji/f_ilm 
Group Guidelines for Biodiversity to clarify the Group`s 
policy on conserving biodiversity .TOPIC
Conser ving biodiversity recognizes 
differences in internal and e xternal 
perceptions 
The Fuji/f_ilm Group has been conducting a range of envi-
ronmental conservation activities based on the idea that 
envir onmental consideration and conservation are an in-
tegral part of corporate activities, recognizing the fact that 
the natural envir onment brings bene/f_its and in/f_luences to 
all its business activities. Conserving biodiversity means 
conserving the ecosystems that sustain us into the future. 
FUJIFILM Holdings encourages Group companies to con-
tinue their envir onmental conservation activities and urges 
them to listen to the opinions of experts and the younger 
generation through stakeholder dialogue meetings*1 and Starting with What We Can Do to Conserve 
the Ecosystems That Sustain HumankindConserving biodiversity
Fujifilm Group Guidelines for Biodiversity
Basic Concepts
Action GuidelinesIn order to create a sustainable society, we have a 
responsibility to sincerely address serious problems 
currently facing us to eliminate negative legacies being 
passed on to futur e generations.
Among these serious problems, including climate change 
issues such as global warming, is biodiversity loss 
that is occurring at critical speed due to destruction of 
ecosystem s and extinction of various living species. 
Biodiversity provides us with food, medicine, and energy 
while reducing the risk of disasters. It is the very foundation of our culture and art, supporting our life and daily 
activities.
As the Fujifilm Group`s business activities are closely 
related to biodiversity, it is our responsibility to avoid 
or minimize negative impacts on it, by addressing its 
preservation and sustainable usage. In doing so, it is 
essential to take into consideration that we exist in a 
state of global interdependence and keep an international 
perspective when taking necessary actions. 
❶To avoid destruction of biodiversity
Biodiversity is the lweb of life.z In business activities, the 
Fuji/f_ilm Group avoids or minimizes negative impacts on 
this web of life, and gives due consideration not to have 
anything to do with destruction of the web. 
❷To preserve biodiversity
In business activities, the Fuji/f_ilm Group strives to keep 
the natural envir onment healthy and diverse, considering 
environmental preservation that re/f_lects the natural and 
social conditions of each local community . 
❸To make best use of biodiversity
The Fujifilm Group adopts sustainable methods to use 
biological resources for business activities, based on a 
long-term point of view, in order to maintain biodiversity 
for futur e generations. ❹To act globally
The Fujifilm Group strives to recognize impacts on 
biodiversity to reduce environmental burdens in 
domestic and overseas value chain frameworks when 
performing business activities.
❺To meet social requirements
The Fujifilm Group complies with international laws 
and regulations regarding biodiversity, and values 
collaboration and harmony with public bodies, NPO/
NGOs, and other comp anies. 
❻To share information
The Fujifilm Group proactively discloses information 
on activities regarding biodiversity. The Fujifilm  
Group also makes efforts to raise employees` awar eness 
of biodiversity issues to improve the quality and 
effectiveness of the Gr oup`s activities for such issues.〉〉  Expecting a lot from the proposal for new work styles
I would like to pay respects to the very ambitious policy that 
FUJIFILM and Fuji Xerox, which have fundamentally different busi-ness structures, have set as their common target, which is to re-duce the lifecycle CO
2 emissions of their products by 30% by fiscal 
2020. At the dialogue meeting, I strongly felt the commitment of the Fujifilm Group to supporting social reform. In order to promote the anti-global warming measures as requested by the IPCC, it is neces-sary to review the work styles of individuals, and I expect that the two companies will pro-pose new work styles through their products and services.〉〉  Creating a new market for the solution of 
environmental problems
I was most impressed to find out that the Group is proposing 
new work styles and lifestyles with low environmental impact, in addition to making efforts to reduce the environmental impact of its business operations. The Group is committed to creat-ing a new market for the solution of environmental problems in cooperation with employees and consumers. I expect that the Group will successfully develop re-markable new innovative business on a global scale.VOICE VOICE

Adding lbiodiversity conser vationz to the design criteria 
for all products
In February 2010, FUJIFILM added biodiversity conserva-
tion to the design criteria of all its products. By adding bio-
diversity conservation to the criteria, which included pre-
vention of global warming and reduction of envir onmental 
impact, effective use of resour ces, safety and compliance, and information disclosur e, the company will be able to 
provide products and services with higher envir onmental 
quality in a continuous manner .
Speci/f_ically , the following two evaluation items for bio-
diversity conservation wer e added:

All the expected benefits of FUJIFILM’s low-chemistry solution 
were proven within a short time. In fact, we do not replenish with any wash or solvent, we keep the bath level stable with just pure water, there is no need to control the pH or conductivity. The only waste we generate during the plate processing is the used fluid in the finishing unit which equates to 2,000 m
2. This means that 
we have reduced our chemical waste by 80%. And, as there is no water involved, we will save an additional €4,000 each year in water charges. In our experience, FUJIFILM can definitely clas-sify the PRO-V system as a bona fide “increased quality, reduced cost” solution.

Speciﬁc initiatives  
(Fuji Xerox and its afﬁliates)
Starting the lOne Compan y, One Themez Mo vement
In October 2009, Fuji Xerox launched its “One Company , 
One Theme” Movement. Since then, employees of both its 
sites and subsidiaries of Fuji Xerox have been conduct-
ing localized social contribution activities both within and 
outside Japan, based on the common theme of “biodiver -
sity conservation.” Through this movement, Fuji Xerox will 
expand its measur es for biodiversity conservation beyond 
national boundaries and make more contributions through 
borderless social contribution activities as well as through 
its businesses.
In /f_iscal 2009, the company established a platform to 
register and share information on the “One Company , One 
Theme” Movement conducted at each  site and subsidiary 
through the intranet and by other means, and employees 
are now sharing information, as shown in the following 
photos.
In /f_iscal 2010, Fuji Xerox will create a guidebook on 
the movement as a means of providing both internal ex-
amples and know-how to promote the activity , post the 
guidebook on the intranet, and encourage employees to 
raise their awar eness and do more for conscious  activities 
of biodiversity .Beginning on-site sur vey on land use for biodiversity 
conser vation at production bases both in and outside Japan  
We conducted on-site survey on land use and local liv-
ing creatur es at /f_ive production bases *1 in Japan (in Mie, 
Niigata, Toyama, and Kanagawa) from March to May 2010. 
We will conduct the same on-site survey also at four of our 
production bases *2 in China and Thailand from September 
2010 . We will complete the on-site survey and plan and 
implement countermeasur es by the end of /f_iscal 2010, and 
will incorporate biodiversity conservation items into our 
envir onmental management system (EMS) during the next 
/f_iscal year .

Social contribution activities
In August 2009, we held an exhibition of animal photos at 
FUJIFILM SQUARE, a showroom in Tokyo Midtown, where 
the head of/f_ices of FUJIFILM Holdings, FUJIFILM, and Fuji 
Xerox are located. A total of about 60,000 people visited the 
exhibition, through which we provided visitors with an op-
portunity to think about the environment and ecosystems.

processless CTP plate
We have adopted processless technology, which will replace con-
ventional CTP just as we witnessed the dramatic shift from “film and conventional PS plate” to CTP plates. The adopted system does not need processing, developer and gum and we have been able to reduce waste liquid to zero, which has led to a substantial reduction in our cost and maintenance burdens as well as in our environmental impact.
As the use of processless plates expands, even greater envi-
ronmental benefits and cost reduction will be gained. I very much hope that the use of the processless CTP plate, which represents a new challenge with new technology, will motivate employees.User`s voice (Japan) User`s voice (Belgium)

Helping suppliers make impro vements 
through the self-check sur vey
(Initiative at Fuji Xerox)
Fuji Xerox has been continuing the CSR-oriented procure-
ment of materials since August 2007. The company sends 
a self-check list to its major suppliers (having a 90% or 
more share in the supply of a speci/f_ic material) and asks 
them to self-check and impr ove their CSR activities.
Fuji Xerox fosters CSR-oriented  procurement to share 
CSR-r elated values and targets with suppliers, learn and 
grow mutually with them, and prosper together by mini-
mizing the risks related to the envir onment, human rights 
and labor , and corporate ethics. After collecting the self-
check lists from suppliers, the staff members in charge 
at Fuji Xerox visit the suppliers to con/f_irm the self-check 
details, understand their problems,  and discuss solutions 
for improvement. In turn, the suppliers point out the im-
provements to be made to the self-check system to the 
visiting staf f.
In /f_iscal 2009, against the target of 90%, 96.9% of the 
suppliers achieved the important numerical targets that 
should be met to avoid serious risks.
In addition to the CSR-oriented procurement of mate-
rials, Fuji Xerox is also committed to CSR-oriented  trans-
portation. Since /f_iscal 2008 the company has been send-
ing a self-check list to each of its major partner carriers 
jointly with FUJIFILM Logistics and asking them to self-
check and improve their activities. In /f_iscal 2009, Fuji Xerox 
interviewed some of the leading partners and identi/f_ied the 
challenges to be tackled based on the results of the self-
check survey and the interviews.
In /f_iscal 2010, Fuji Xerox will foster CSR-oriented pro-
curement more ef/f_iciently while giving even more support 
to suppliers to increase the achievement rate of the impor -
tant tar gets to 100% at all the suppliers.The Fujifilm Group Will Pursue CSR-Oriented 
Procurement in Partnership with SuppliersDeveloping a CSR-oriented procurement framework
Formulation of the Fujifilm Group 
Procurement P olicy
In October 2009, FUJIFILM Holdings established the 
Fuji/f_ilm Group Procurement Policy (shown below) to im-
prove its CSR-oriented procurement, which had been fos-
tered by each operating company in the Group. We will 
foster such procurement in cooperation with our suppliers 
by sharing the Policy across the Group and proactively ex-
changing r elevant in formation with the suppliers.
The Fuji/f_ilm Group Procurement Policy is applied not 
only to the Fuji/f_ilm Group but also to its entire supply chain 
and is designed to help the Group build fair relations with 
its suppliers. Accor dingly , the Policy shows the Group`s 
commitment to dealing with suppliers in compliance with laws and in consideration of the human rights, envir onment 
and other CSR issues. The Policy is composed of two 
parts: I. Basic Procurement Concepts and II. Procurement 
Guideline. The second part shows the 10 principles of the 
Group that were formulated in line with Nippon Keidanr en`s 
Charter for Corporate Behavior . The Group deals with a 
range of suppliers from different industrial /f_ields because 
it is engaged in a wide spectrum of business /f_ields, includ-
ing chemicals, pharmaceuti cals, and precision equipment. 
The principles are intended to help these suppliers under -
stand the Group`s approach to procurement. For suppliers 
who do not meet the Procurement Guideline, we will ask 
them to make necessary corrections and give support as 
requir ed to ensur e their compliance with the Guideline.

In this polic y, lprocurementz inc ludes not only procurement of parts and materials used for products but also v arious 
trade activities such as procurement of indirectly related materials,  maintenance and management of f acilities,  etc.
I. Basic Procurement Concepts
As a r esponsible member of the inter national community , the Fuji/f_ilm Gr oup seeks to contribute to the development of 
society and enhancem ent of the quality of life of people thr oughout the world by pr oviding top-quality pr oducts and 
services. In or der to achieve these objectives, we perform pr ocurement activities based on the following basic concepts:
II. Procurement Guideline
Fuji/f_ilm Gr oup r equests all suppliers r elated to our pr ocurement activities to follow the ten principles below:⁞  Rational selection standards
We will select suppliers based upon rational 
and clear standards, such as quality, price, 
delivery assurance and operating stability, so 
as to procure superior goods and services from the most competitive sources. Decisions on procurement are made by the Procurement 
Division, which is independent from other 
divisions.   Opennes s and f airness
We will impartially provide all Japanese and overseas suppliers with opportunities to supply 
their products and services to us. In addition, we 
will vigorously strive to procure these not only from suppliers involved in past transactions, but from newcomers as well.⁠  Corporate social responsibility (CSR)
In conducting our procurement activities, we will seek to proactively fulfill our role as a good 
corporate citizen contributing to the society by 
taking into consideration CSR related factors such as compliance to regulations, product quality/safety, environment conservation, information 
security, fair trade, ethics, workers’ safety/
hygiene, human rights, and fair labor practices.
⁞  Suppliers, by the development and provision of socially beneficial goods and 
services in a safe and responsible manner, shall strive to earn the satisfaction 
and confidence of consumers and customers, while taking necessary measures to protect personal data and customer related information.
   Suppliers shall promote fair, transparent, free competition and sound trade. 
They shall also ensure that their relationships and contacts with government 
agencies and political bodies are of a sound and proper nature.
⁠  Suppliers shall engage in communication with members of society at large, 
including active and transparent disclosure of corporate information.
⁡  Suppliers shall strive to respect diversity, individuality, and differences of their employees to promote safe and comfortable workplaces.
⁢  Suppliers shall recognize that a positive involvement in resolution of environmental issues is an essential part of their activities and existence, and 
shall therefore approach these issues more proactively.
⁣  As “good corporate citizens,” suppliers shall actively engage in philanthropic 
activities, and other activities of social benefit.
⁤  Suppliers shall reject all contacts with organizations involved in violation of the law or accepted standards of responsible social behavior.⁥  Suppliers shall observe laws and regulations applying to their overseas activities and respect the culture and customs of other nations and strive to 
manage their overseas activities in such a way as to promote and contribute to the development of local communities.
⁦  Senior management executives of suppliers shall assume the responsibility 
for implementing this guideline and for taking all necessary action in order to 
raise awareness in their corporation, and inform their group companies and business partners of their responsibility. Senior management executives shall also heed the voice of their stakeholders, both internally and externally, and 
promote the development and implementation of systems that will contribute 
to a greater understanding of business ethics.
⤒  In the case of incidents contrary to the principles of this guideline, senior 
management executives of suppliers must investigate the cause of the 
incident, develop reforms to prevent recurrence, and make information publicly available regarding their intended actions for reform. After the prompt public disclosure of information regarding the incident, authority and responsibility 
for the event should be clarified and disciplinary action should be taken in 
all areas responsible including the highest levels of management where necessary.Starting pilot sur veys on CSR-oriented 
procurement  
(Initiative at FUJIFILM)
FUJIFILM has been fostering green procurement for envi-
ronmental conservation since 2000. In 2006, the company 
began conducting a questionnair e survey of suppliers 
also on their compliance, quality and safety , information 
security , fair trade, ethics, occupational safety and health, 
human rights, and the envir onment, with a view to foster -
ing CSR-oriented procurement. Following the establish-
ment of the Fuji/f_ilm Group Procurement Policy in October 
2009, FUJIFILM asked 32 suppliers of materials to self-
check their CSR activities on a trial basis through elec-
tronic means, aiming to utilize the results as the basis to 
expand CSR-oriented procurement across FUJIFILM and 
its af/f_iliates. In response the suppliers particip ated in the 
self-check survey , which in turn helped them understand 
the FUJIFILM`s ideas about procurement. The company 
tabulated and evaluated the results and summarized them 
into a r eport to give feedback to the r espondents.
In /f_iscal 2010, we will review the survey content based 
on the results of the trial survey and expand the target of 
the CSR self-check survey .
FUJIFILM will continue to ensur e the transpar ency 
and soundness of its management and move forwar d with 
measur es towar d the achievement of a sustainable society 
while impr oving the quality of its dealings with suppliers.

Wining Trust from Stakeholders  
by Improving QualityImproving quality
Pursuing higher quality for products,  
operations,  and management
In early days of our history , Fuji Photo Film, the predeces-
sor of the Fuji/f_ilm Group, repeated trials and errors to de-
velop photographic /f_ilms and improve the manufacturing 
process by making use of its own technologies. As a re-
sult, the company succeeded in providing the market with 
photographic /f_ilms comparable to those made overseas  in 
terms of quality .
In recovering business after the end of the Second 
World War, the company adopted the statistical quality 
contr ol approach from the United States ahead of others 
to provide the market with photographic /f_ilms having the 
world`s top-level quality . It also conducted the total quality 
contr ol (TQC) activity . In recognition of these efforts, the 
company received the Deming Prize in 1956, being appre-
ciated for its compr ehensive quality contr ol activities which 
were conducted in line with the management philosophy 
and business envir onment.
Subsequently in the 1990s, our production depart-
ment acquir ed the ISO 9001 certi/f_ication and in 2003 we 
began introducing an integrated management system con-
sist of quality , envir onment, occupational health and safety , 
and information secur ity gradually to our sales and staff The Fujifilm Group began its operation in the Minami-
Ashigara area blessed with rich water resources and 
clean air in 1934, aiming to manufacture photographic 
films in Japan. We began our manufacturing activities 
to provide the market with products that had both high 
quality and high environmental performance. Toward the 
80th anniversary of our foundation in 2014, we will fur -
ther improve the quality of our products, operations, and management to win even more trust from stakeholders.departments and also to our af/f_iliates. We are aiming to be 
higher quality of the management style through an extend-
ing system to cover development, production, quality as-
surance, and marketing with each of our business divisions 
to impr ove operational pr ocess and outcome.
Responding to changes in the business 
environment and creating high-quality 
business and products
Since the latter half of the 1990s, FUJIFILM has been ap-
plying the base technologies that had accumulated in the 
/f_ields of photographic sensitive materials and xerogra-
phy to create new business in response to the progress 
of digitization. In developing new business and products, 
the company judges not only their quality achievement but 
their envir onmental performance and safety , legal compli-
ance and customer`s requir ement at each stage gate of the 
development process from planning to /f_inal product review 
(/f_igur e below). The company thus ensur es high quality also 
in the /f_ields of highly functional materials, *1 optical devices 
and systems, *2 and information systems and solutions, *3 in 
addition to the /f_ields of photographic /f_ilms.
Also in the /f_ield of generic drugs, in which FUJIFILM 
began participating in April 2010, the company ensur es the 
safety of its products to customers based on the recogni-
tion that the quality of pharmaceuticals could give great 
impact on human lives. Speci/f_ically , FUJIFILM manages 
the quality of raw materials, the manufacturing process 
and design, and products released in the market, applying 
its expertise in quality contr ol systems.

Copiers and printers are composed of a number of 
driving parts, and their friction accounts for a large percent 
of the causes of machine tr oubles.
In the life-long design of copiers and printers, materials 
for the parts are carefully selected based on the reviewed 
designs, and improvements are made to the parts includ-

a room within the hospital. Doctors and radiologists there-
fore had to visit the room to search for the images they 
needed.
Subsequently , with the digitization and progress of IT, 
information systems to centrally manage medical images 
began attracting attention, and SYNAPSE, which adopted 
the WEB technologythe leading-edge technology of that 
time, was released as a base system for medical operations 
including the management of images. With this system, 
doctors and radiologists no longer need to visit the /f_ilm 
storage room and instead can retrieve and view the neces-
sary data instantly via their desktop PCs. This has also cre-
ated a new work style: doctors can now discuss with oth-
ers by phone, with each viewing the images on their own 
PC screens. Moreover , various medical information pieces 
can be centrally managed through the system, including 
electr onic medical records, which promotes communica-
tions within the medical facilities and leads to the formation 
of a patient-oriented cr oss-functional medical team.
As for the C@RNA system, clinics networked by the 
system with general hospitals can ask the hospitals to do 
advanced testing that they themselves cannot do and share 
the images and results of the testing all online using PCs. 
This is gr eatly boosting r egional medical cooperation.
FUJIFILM will con-
tinue to make efforts to 
support doctors and 
other medical staff 
working at the forefront 
of medical care and to 
provide people with 
safe medical services.SYNAPSE receiving high ev aluation  
by enabling the central managem ent of 
medical images
The quality of medical care, which directly gives impact on 
the lives of people, cannot be compr omised. FUJIFILM has 
long been supporting the medical facilities mainly in the 
diagnostic imaging /f_ield, and is now expanding the range 
of its business to sophisticate and raise the ef/f_iciency of 
medical activities across individual and regional medical 
institutions.
As a core tool for the business expansion, FUJIFILM 
released the SYNAPSE information system to centrally 
manage a range of diagnostic images from radiographic, 
endoscopic, and ultrasound testing in the United States 
in 1999. This system was highly evaluated in the country 
and was also released in Japan in 2000. At present, 1,300 
or more medical institutions in Japan has introduced the FUJIFILM makes social contributions through business, 
for example through its medical systems business. In ad-
dition to providing a range of diagnostic imaging equip-
ment and pharmaceuticals, the company is also engaged 
in building a medical care network by the use of IT, which 
is attracting much public attention.system, making it the most-selling information system for 
medical images.
FUJIFILM also began providing the C@RNA service in 
2005 and has been improving the network envir onment to 
connect general hospitals with clinics for better local and 
remote medical car e services.
Strong demand for role-sharing and 
cooperation between medical institutions  
in Japan
In the United States, it was and is usual for patients to 
be /f_irst treated by their lhome doctorsz and then referred 
to general hospitals as requir ed by the doctors. Medical 
institutions are thus well sharing roles and cooperating 
with each other . SYNAPSE became popular in the country 
because it proved to be useful for medical institutions to 
share necessary information.
In Japan, patients tended to consult with their home 
doctors for any diseases regardless of their expert /f_ields 
and also to visit general hospitals even for the treatment of 
a cold. Medical institutions were thus not sharing roles in 
an ef /f_icient and ef fective manner .
Recently , however , the necessity of role sharing and 
cooperation between medical institutions has been increas-
TOPIC
Saitama National Hospital opened its new hospital with 350 beds on January 
1, 2010. By providing medical services at this new hospital, the opening of which was long coveted by our staff and local residents, we will further fulfill our roles as a hospital designated as core facilities for the treatment of circulatory diseases, support of regional medical care, regional coopera-tion for the treatment of cancers, and for local care for hepatic diseases. I believe the regional medical care support system using IT will be quite useful for the fulfillment of the aforementioned roles. We will implement this system based on the face-to-face communication.
In 2005, through a joint research project with FUJIFILM and four 
medical associations, Saitama National Hospital began building a C@RNA Connect system as part of measures to promote a new type of regional medical cooperation. Eventually a medical networking system has been es-tablished, which allows patients to make reservations for medical treatment by doctors specializing in each medical field at the hospital via their home doctors 24 hours a day. For example, they can make reservations for MRI, ʫʫ  Medical cooperation network to promote the physical and mental health of local peopleVOICE
MDCT, ultrasound diagnostics, endoscopic testing, physiological function 
testing, and counseling on nutrition. The results of the testing are sent to the clinics of their home doctors together with important images by the next day of the testing. The doctors are highly evaluating this system, which enables their patients to receive a “virtual hospital service” at their own clinics. In the future, we will expand the network with clinics and other hospitals to improve the quality of regional medical care, including the maintenance of local people’s health, preventive medicine, and nursing care. As a result, we will be able to provide all necessary medical services within the region or establish a “regional virtual total care system.”
Dr. Eiichi Sekizuka  
Director of  
National Hospital Organization
Saitama National Hospital 
ingly recognized in Japan, because the following problems 
became obvious, which might lead to the corruption of 
the national medical system: insuf /f_iciency of doctors and 
resulting overwork by doctors working in hospitals; more 
/f_inancial burdens on medical institutions because of the 
need of introducing more advanced medical equipment; 
and management risks caused by errors in medical treat-
ment. As a result, medical institutions are having greater 
expectations for SYNAPSE and C@RNA.

The local gover nment of Sao Paulo, Brazil decided to adopt 
FUJIFILM`s SYNAPSE medical image information network 
in the gover nment`s large-scale new-generation regional 
medical infrastructur e establishment pr oject (SEDI-I).
This project aims to network a diagnosis center with 
general hospitals and out-patient clinics to improve the 
diagnostic ef/f_iciency by the centralization of diagnostic 
functions and to introduce the management know-how of 
private hospitals to public ones to raise their management 
ef/f_iciency . SYNAPSE was adopted as the core system 
for the network in recognition of its speed, reliability , and 
stability .
At the diagnostic center newly established in Sao Paulo 
in October 2009, a party was held to celebr ate the full-
scale launch of the project, inviting the state gover nor and 
the head of the state`s health and welfar e department as well as a lot of people from the medical industry . SYNAPSE 
will be introduced to a total of 20 medical institutions by the 
end of 2011, and the diagnostic center will deal with two 
million medical examination cases per year .

educational opportunities 
Fuji Xerox of Shenzhen regards the ful/f_illment of CSR and 
envir onmental protection as one of its management priori-
ties and conducts social contribution activities as part of 
its CSR-oriented management. Speci/f_ically , the company 
had been engaged in cleanup activities in neighboring riv-
ers and beaches and planted trees near its premises. In 
order to conduct social contribution activities on an even 
higher level, the company formed a volunteer organization 
with an approval of the relevant municipal entity . Through 
this in-house volunteer organization, which is expected to 
promote the understanding of Fuji Xerox of Shenzhen by 
Chinese society and local inhabitants and increase volun-
tarism among employees, employees volunt eer to visit the 
elderly and the weak, collect money for the victims of dis-
asters, protect the envir onment, and provide community 
services after work and on weekends.
A number of young people from rural areas are working 
in cities in South China, and also at Fuji Xerox of Shenzhen 
there are many young employees who are from rural areas. 
In consideration of these employees, the company is giving 
support to particularly poor rural areas for the solution of 
social problems peculiar to the areas. For example in 2005, 
when it celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation, 
the company made a donation for the establishment of an 
elementary school in Dunhuang, wanting to provide local childr en with an educational opportunity . Subsequently 
two more elementary schools were established by the sup-
port of the company each in Hebei and Yunnan. Since af-
ter the establishment of the three schools, the company 
has been continuously donating 
money (both from the company 
and the labor union) and goods 
such as PCs to the schools and 
also annually sends about /f_ive 
employees to the schools to 
encourage pupils ther e.
Students in the Dunhuang Elementary SchoolFuji Xerox Art SpaceFuji Xerox opened Fuji Xerox Art Space in 2003, wanting to 
provide more people with an opportunity to enjoy watching 
prints, which belong to an artistic category that is closer to 
our cor e businesses, copying and documents. 
In 2010, Fuji Xerox R&D Squar e was completed in 
Yokohama City as a new compr ehensive R&D base of Fuji 
Xerox, and we have moved the aforementioned gallery to 
the /f_irst /f_loor of this new building to provide general pub-
lic with an opportunity to make exchanges with employ-
ees of Fuji Xerox and enjoy watching the Fuji Xerox Print 
Collection. We believe that the new location of the gallery is 
really suitable for displaying art works, which are common 
social assets, to a lot of citizens.
Fuji Xerox R&D Squar e is an R&D base for creative 
manufacturing, while art works can be said to be ldocu-
ments through which artists express their unique wisdom 
and emotions.z Both art and science create things, and we 
want to make the Squar e a place wher e a lot of employ-
ees and citizens are inspir ed by excellent artistic works and 
make exchanges to become mor e creative.

(FUJIFILM Manuf acturing Europe B.V ., The Netherlands)
The rural estate, Huis ter Heide, close to the FUJIFILM 
Manufacturing Europe B.V. in Tilbur g, has been under con-
struction since 1993. The company has been offering /f_i-
nancial support to Dutch natur e preservation organisation 
Natuurmonumenten for four years now and will continue 
to do so at least for two more years. Woodland and agri-

Introducing returnable containers 
to substantially decrease the use of 
containers and waste  
(FUJIFILM Electronic Materials (Europe) N.V ., Belgium)
FUJIFILM Electr onic Materials (Europe) N.V., which manu-
factur es and sells photo resists and /f_lat panel display ma-
terials, has been fostering the use of returnable containers 
in the delivery of products to customers since 2002. The 
use rate of returnable containers, which was about 72% in 
2002, increased to about 94% in 2008. In 2009, the com-
pany also began using tanks to deliver products more ef-
/f_iciently in large amounts. Now in terms of weight, out of 
those products deliver ed to customers in returnable con-
tainers, about one- third is deliver ed in tanks.
Retur nable containers are not suitable for delivery to 
customers who buy only small amounts of products, but 
for customers who constantly purchase products from the 
company , delivery in returnable containers is useful, be-
cause it helps reduce the cost of disposing of containers 
and cardboar d, and products can be sold at lower prices 
in returnable containers than in disposable ones. What is 
more, customized barcode management and labeling ser-
vices can be provided for products deliver ed in returnable 
containers.Supporting education in photographic

FUJIFILM Imaging Germany GmbH & Co. KG provided a

a wellknown school which specializes in the education of 
young people to work in the photographic area. Over the

Supporting Nature Photography 
(FUJIFILM  Europe GmbH,  German y)
For 12 years, the world famous natur e photo competition 
is being carried out with participation of photographers 
from more than 40 different countries through the years. 
FUJIFILM is supporting this state of the art event since the 
beginning in 1999. As one of the core events of photog-
raphy , the lInter nationale Fürstenfelder Naturfototagez are 
being carried out each year. FUJIFILM is among the main 
sponsors and supports the event also through the produc-
tion of high quality prints. Introducing a water rec ycling system  
to substantially decrease water use and  
the discharge of wastewater 
(FUJIFILM Europe N.V ., Belgium)
FUJIFLM Europe N.V. uses a lot of water to manufactur e 
chemicals for photography and printing. In order to main-
tain the water quality and reduce water use, the company 
has installed a water recycling system to its waste liquid 
treatment equipment, as shown in the /f_igur e on the right.
By introducing the water recycling system, the compa-
ny reduced its water consumption to about 25% of previous 
levels in 2009. Speci/f_ically, the annual use of industrial water 
was reduced from 4,000 m3 to 1,000 m3 and the use of un-
derground water from 61,000 m3 to 21,000 m3. The recycling 
system installed in the factory chemically processes water 
used in the production system and stores the processed 
water in a tank so that there is a stable supply that can be 
reused in the production process.  
Moreover , thanks to the water recycling system, the 
amount of wastewater dischar ged outside the factory 
has also been substantially decreased from 22,000 m3 to 
10,000 m3.The /f_irst stages of this 
recovery have been 
completed. The Tilbur g 
plant also supports 
many regional and lo-
cal projects like photo 
exhibitions, volunteer 
work, sports events, 
and many other activities and events. This is done with do-
nations and with photographic support.⾣ Waste liquid treatment equipment and

initiative from the beginning. FUJIFILM was since more 
than 20 years my personal /f_ilmtill today I work ana-

our approach. So I was very happy to win FUJIFILM as 
a main sponsor of our events, /f_irst reason of the qual-

Accounting
Expenses that have been necessar y for developing the labor environment 
and for social contributions have been tabula ted and categorized by stake-
holder . Great effort has been directed toward improving the workplace for 
emplo yees,  including safety (barrier -free environment for disabled persons) 
and emplo yee welfare (improvement of cafeteria facilities).  Expenses in so-
cial contributions in the form of promoting culture and the arts include the 
cost of running FUJIFILM SQUARE and organizing photogra phy contests.  In 
contributions to the interna tional community , assistance has been provided 
in the form of relief funds and shipment of X-ray film for victims of the ma-
jor earthquakes that took place in Haiti and Chile in Januar y and Februar y 
2010.

In April 2010, FUJIFILM Pharma commenced sales of 178 generic drug 
products. In entering this new market, the company’s design center coop-erated with other relevant divisions to develop a package design with a new image and clarity for the product identity.
Designers and personnel from various divisions visited to medical 
workplaces where the products are to be used in order to study conditions for pharmaceutical product displays and to interview medical personnel and pharmacists who are the actual users of the products. The packaging re-quirements identified were organized and trimmed down to the key require-ment of “easy identification from a wide range of items.”
In order to satisfy this requirement, packaging for all items was unified 
in a simple design format, with the drug name, quantity (or concentration) of the active ingredients and dosage form (tablets, capsules, injection solution, etc.) made easily identifiable with large icons based on a unified design. Also, in order to emphasize reliability, which is the most important factor for a pharmaceutical product, and to clearly state the fact that FUJIFILM has entered the market, emphasis was placed on prominent green, reflecting a strong sense of trust and safety for the FUJIFILM brand that had been established in the photographic film business for many years. (See illustra-tion below.)
We plan to continue to pay careful attention to the opinions of our 
customers, identifying what is really needed, applying the findings in prod-uct and design development and contributing to the growth of FUJIFILM Pharma.

Building workplaces where safety 
comes ﬁrst
In order to ensure emplo yee safety and stability , both physically and men-
tally, the Fujifilm Group is promoting workplace development where worker 
safety comes first and careful attention is paid to the tasks involved in each 
work opera tion.
Application of our ver y own MSDS
Many of the products used in photogra phic developing chemicals and 
semiconductor photoresist solutions contain chemicals.  In supplying these 
products to customers,  Fujifilm Group submits material safety data sheets 
(MSDS*1) as well, as a means of providing customers informa tion to prevent 
accidents with chemicals and to assure safety for human health and the 
ecosystem.
Inside the corpora te group,  FUJIFILM has developed its own unique 
MSDS (known as FMSD S) in its drive to implement exhaustive labor safety 
and environmental protection mana gement.  With this data sheet,  emplo yees 
in manufacturing workplaces are able to access informa tion on methods of 
handling chemical substances and important details that require attention 
in handling a t any time.  
First introduced in 2000,  FMSDS includes not only safety informa tion 
from MSDS and other data issued by the compan yʼs business partners,  ap-
plicable laws and regula tions,  handling methods,  etc., but also is upda ted 
with all revisions to laws and regula tions.  Furthermore,  the latest regula tory 
upda tes are added from FUJIFILMʼs database,  and safety data that is neces-
sary but not available is obtained by conducting internal safety experiments,  
based on the compan yʼs chemical control standards,*2 and the data is pro-
vided to workplaces handling chemical substances.
FMSDS has also adopted the UN Globally Harmonized System of 
Classifica tion and Labeling Chemicals (GHS*3), the interna tional standard 
on chemical safety , in order to build a mana gement system in compliance 
with the 2006 guidelines issued by Japanʼs Ministr y of Health,  Labour and 
Welfare on the hazards,  toxicity , etc., of chemical substances.  At the same 
time,  action has started in Februar y 2010 on applying FMSDS in the global 
organiza tion. The entire group will continue to pursue improvements in 
occupa tional health and safety through the pursuit of environmental and 
safety mana gement tha t is both exhaustive and of a higher caliber . 
*1  Material Safety Data Sheet:  Informa tion sheet showing data related to chemical substance 
safety
*2  Fujifilm Groupʼs mana gement standards regarding laws and regula tions,  important notes 
on chemical hazards and handling and stora ge of chemical substances,  measures to pre-
vent exposure,  measures in case of emergenc y, warnings regarding disposal and transport,  
etc., that are more rigorous than the la ws of Ja pan.
*3  GHS: Action taken by the United Nations to promote classifica tion standards and labeling of 
the hazards and toxicity of chemical substances to be shared on a global scale.ʫʫ  Safety Ev aluation Center ev aluation for labor safety in 
the handling of chemical substances
In addition to information obtained from MSDS issued by its business 
partners, FUJIFILM checks the information necessary for environ-mental and safety management of chemical substances that are de-veloped, manufactured and purchased, by means of laboratory test-ing and research in its Safety Evaluation Center. The laboratory and research findings are added to the FMSDS database for information sharing. Approximately 6,300 chemical substances are registered in the database.
The Safety Evaluation Center is the facility that comply with 
GLP
*. The Center not only conducts chemical safety evaluations for 
FUJIFILM, but also receives commissions for evaluation from Fuji Xerox, Toyama Chemical and other members of the corporate group, administrative authorities and other organizations.
*  GLP (Good Labora tory Practice) is an interna tional standard established to define 
the organiza tion, facilities,  procedure manuals,  etc., that are necessar y for a test 
facility to assure the reliability of its chemical substance safety testing perfor -
mance.  The Safety Evalua tion Center has been certified as compliant with the act 
on the evalua tion of chemical substances and regula tion of their manufacture,  etc., 
by the Ministr y of Economy , Trade and Industr y, the Ministr y of Health,  Labour and 
Welfare and the Ministr y of the Environment.TOPIC

⾣ Respect for human rights and elimination of discrimination
Founded on the principles of the Fujifilm Group Charter for Corpora te 
Beha vior, FUJIFILM respects basic human rights and will not enga ge in any 
act whatsoever that unfairly infringes the human rights of its emplo yees.  We 
do not discrimina te on the basis of gender , age, nationality , ethnic origin,  be-
liefs, religion,  social position,  physical condition,  or other characteristics and 
respect the privac y of our emplo yees.  To prevent sexual harassment,  we 
have continuously implemented activities to raise awareness and dissemi-
nate informa tion within the compan y, including the revision and distribu-
tion of sexual harassment prevention guidelines based on the revised Equal 
Emplo yment Opportunity Law, that took effect in 2007,  to all emplo yees of 
FUJIFILM and its affilia tes. We also defined the prohibition of power harass-
ment in our compan y regula tions.
In addition,  we have provided a telephone consulta tion service (the 
compliance and sexual harassment helpline) where arrangements have 
been made for external specialized counselors to receive requests for 
consulta tion from emplo yees.  While respecting the privac y of individuals 
receiving consulta tion, we work toward the resolution of these issues.  Other 
related activities include periodic training sessions for personnel in mana-
gerial positions in FUJIFILM and its affilia tes on the subjects of respect for 
human rights and the elimina tion of discrimina tion.Objective Evaluation Item

▶ Respect for human rights and elimination of 
discrimination
In fiscal 2009,  provisions on respect of human rights,  prohibition of dis-
crimina tion, prohibition of harassment,  protection of privac y, etc., were es-
tablished based on the principle of “respect for basic human rights” in the 
ALL-FX Code of Conduct (applies also to affilia tes and sales companies).  
Based on this code,  various training programs for new emplo yees,  new 
mana gerial emplo yees,  etc., have been organized,  and activities have been 
organized to inform and promote wider awareness,  collect signa tures to 
petition for the legisla tion of the human rights violation relief law (tenta tive 
name),  solicit slogans to promote human rights awareness and to circula te 
Ashita-e  (To Tomorro w), a newsletter on human rights,  among general man-
agers (distributed twice).
We are also a member of the Tokyo Corpora te Liaison Society 
Promoting Human Rights Awareness and worked in collabora tion with other 
members in order to exchange of informa tion and promote a wareness.Fujifilm Group Green P olicy

Environmental Burdens of the Fujifilm Group
The worldwide recession failed to de-
liver signi/f_icant progress in recovery in 
/f_iscal 2009, except for certain markets. 
However , the Fuji/f_ilm Group was actively 
involved in improving production ef/f_i-
ciency , reducing envir onmental burden 
and many other activities. As a result, the 
envir onmental burden (in CO 2 equivalent) 
of product lifecycles related to the Fuji/f_ilm 
Group fell at every stage. In addition, out-
put of waste and VOCs, as well as water 
consumption, dropped below the levels 
for the preceding /f_iscal year. On the other 
hand, sluggish sales failed to bring notice-
able impr ovements in Eco Ef /f_iciency .Eco-Efficiency from Fiscal 2004 to Fiscal 2009 (Fiscal 2000 as base year) Over view of fiscal 2009

[Notes]
•  Waste generation: Action has been taken on converting plastics into valuable 
resources, especially at production plants in Japan. 
•  Consumed natural resources: TAC consumption volume has grown with expansion of the FP display business. 
•  Atmospheric emissions of VOCs: Reduction effort is continuing chiefly at domestic 
production plants with the largest output. •  Water consumption: Effort is being made to reduce water consumption through 
multistage cascaded system, despite the impact of the economy. 
•  Consumed packaging materials: Measures are being implemented to reduce package size, to package in larger units, reduce consumption of resources and substitution 
with materials with less environmental impact.*1 Materials: Aluminum, T AC, PET , silver and gelatin

Direct control over environmental burden by Fujifilm Group*1  Environmental burden of resource procurement was estimated for major materials procured, using specific coefficients derived from input-output table.
*2  Environmental burden of product manufacturing was calculated from the total volume of energy (electricity, petroleum & gas) used chiefly in the manufacturing processes.
*3  Environmental burden of product transportation was calculated from the modeling transportation both in Japan and overseas.
*4  Environmental burden of product usage by customers was estimated with 2009 model copiers, printers and fax machines, estimated with 5-year amount of energy used, and other 
products, estimated by multiplying the estimated number of products in operations by the estimated amount of energy used for other products.
*5  Environmental burden of waste disposal and recycling was calculated based on the volume of procured materials and does not include environmental burden from recycling.

Environmental Aspects
⾣Zero emissions
FUJIFILM achieved its zero emissions targets in ﬁscal 2003,  yet is con-
stantly striving to take waste mana gement to the next level.  Our issue for 
the future is to achieve zero emissions at FUJIFILMʼs overseas production 
afﬁlia tes and new companies that have joined the Fujiﬁlm Group.  Guidance 
is being provided chiefly to production sites genera ting large waste out-
puts. While the deﬁnition of ʻzero emissionsʼ differs at FUJIFILM and Fuji 
Xerox due to inherent differences in our respective lines of business,  zero 
emission activities can be deﬁned as “efforts to recycle all waste material 
from business opera tions,  and to ensure no waste is processed by simple 
incinera tion or landﬁll.”⾣ Reduction in e xport packaging material weight*

●   Environment-rela ted facility spending dropped drama tically in fiscal 2009,  
due to a drastic reduction and focus of investment into manufacturing-
related facilities a t production plants.
●   Investments related to flat-panel display manufacturing facilities are aimed 
at energ y-saving performance in the waste hea t recover y facilities.
●   The effect resulted in a reduction of roughly ¥500 million over the previ-
ous fiscal year, with a decline in energ y consumption notwithstanding the 
growth in output over fiscal 2008.  The effect value has decreased due 
to a drop in fuel costs in 2009 vis-à-vis 2008.  CO2 emissions have also 
declined by roughly 40 kilotons.

Pushing for less environmental burden and coe xistence with  
the local community
FUJIFILM`s Kanagawa Factory (Ashigara & Odawara Sites) had been selected by my predecessors at 
the company for their abundance of clean water and air. The area is blessed with rich natural beauty, 
with the mountains of Hakone to the west, Tanzawa mountains to the north and a view of Karigawa and 
Sakawagawa rivers in the east. Although subsequent development has led to growth of built-up areas, 
we believe it is our foremost responsibility to preserve the natural envir onment and outstanding residen-
tial ar eas in the r egion, alongside our manufacturing activities as a business corporation.
The Ashigara Site manufactur es /f_lat-panel display materials such as FUJIT AC, FUJIFILM`s leading 
product, which is polarizer protection /f_ilm used for LCD displays, as well as photographically sensitized 
materials and new functional performance materials, available for wide use by our customers. At the 
same time, there are activities to prevent environmental pollution, reduce CO2 emission, save energy 
consumption, reduce waste and cut VOC (volatile organic compounds) emissions. Especially in the area 
of CO 2 emissions, the Ashigara Site has switched from the use of heavy oil to 100% use of city gas as 
fuel for its power generators. With the installation of the new boilers, etc., this started up in September 
2009.
We plan to be actively involved in reducing envir onmental burden and in coexisting with the local 
community while pursuing development of our manufacturing activities in the futur e.Nobuhisa Sekiguchi
Corporate Vice President, 
General Manager of Kanagawa Factory   FUJIFILM Corporation(at that time)
Contribution to reducing environmental burden through conservation of  
energy and resources adapted to the product lifecycle, from technology development  
to after customer use
Fuji Xerox`s Takematsu Center is the company`s base for the development and manufacturing of imag-
ing materials for copiers, multifunction of/f_ice machines, printers, etc. With its cutting-edge development 
capabilities and manufacturing technologies, it supports the drive for energy conservation, outstanding 
resolution and the reliability of Fuji Xerox products. Through development of EA toner , which has made 
possible lower fusing temperatur es and a /f_iner grain diameter than had been impossible in past manufac-
turing methods, as well as IH fusing technology that delivers the world`s top startup speed, it has contrib-
uted to reducing CO 2 emissions in the manufacturing process and to minimizing consumption of energy 
and toners by its customers. The Center is also the supply center for of/f_ice equipment supplies such as 
photor eceptor drums and toners and has taken early action in the collection and recycling of used sup-
plies. Through the reuse and material recycling of toner cartridges and units after disassembly , we have 
promoted recycling to conserve resources and energy and achieved lzero emissionsz in January 1997. 
In March of the same year, the Center received ISO 14001 certi/f_ication and plans to continue maintaining 
zero emissions and waste contr ol under the ISO system.

Regular medical checkups are important for breast cancer , because there is 
more than a 90% probability of cure with early detection.  However , breast 
cancer examina tion rates in Japan are extremely low, rating at roughly 
20%*1 compared to a pproxima tely 70% in Western na tions.
Fujifilm Group has directed great energ y into the development of 
mammogra phy (breast x-ray*2) technolog y that contributes to early detec-
tion with images that are clear and with minimal noise and is marketing 
its digital mammogra phy system*3 worldwide.  For this reason,  it is actively 
involved in the Pink Ribbon Movement.
In 2002,  the support slogan lBreast Cancer Examina tion Awareness 
Activityz was printed on Fujicolor print bags. Since 2004,  the compan y 
is sponsoring the Pink Ribbon Smile Walk (the number of participants for 
2004-2009 totaling 50,000).With the expansion of the Fujifilm Group and the increase in the number 
of affilia ted companies in various regions,  consolida ted control of environ-
mental activities on a group-wide scale has become increasingly difficult.  
At the same  time,  the reinforcement of regional headquarters functions has 
made mana gement in this area possible on a regional basis.  For these rea-
sons,  the way that the environmental mana gement organiza tion has been 
implementing Fujifilm group`s environmental activities has been revised 
since 2008.  Under the organiza tion, FUJIFILM head office is to develop a 
worldwide policy for environmental mana gement and bear the responsibil-
ity of environmental governance.  The regional headquarters in charge of 
the respective regions are to play the role of promoters of more detailed 
and careful environmental activities adapted to regional characteristics.  At 
During the Pink Ribbon Month in October 2009,  a photo exhibition featuring 
Ms. Kaori Kawamura,  who passed away after a long struggle with breast 
cancer , was held at FUJIFILM SQUARE,  a showroom complex located in 
Tokyo Midto wn, drawing approxima tely 48,000 visitors.  On October 3 when 
the Pink Ribbon Smile Walk Tokyo (participants:  Approx.  6,000) was held, 
FUJIFILM`s equipment*4 used for breast cancer examina tion was put on 
display , along with a section offering visitors the opportunity to learn how 
to examine for breast cancer with a breast mockup,  offering people who have never experienced breast cancer examina tion informa tion to encour -
age taking checkups without reluctance.
At the 2nd FUJIFILM Senior Championship golf tournament held at 
Hiraka wa Countr y Club in Chiba City, participa ting golf pros all wore Pink 
Ribbon badges while playing.  A mammogra phy examina tion vehic le was 
set up on the grounds to encoura ge all interested persons and to commu-
nicate the importance of breast cancer checkups to everyone,  regardless 
of gender .
For FUJIFILM emplo yees,  awareness promotion seminars and intro-
duction of a gynecological cancer examina tion subsid y program*5 led to a 
drama tic increase in the number of emplo yees undergoing breast cancer 
examina tions in the past several years.

Cancer is the No. 1 cause of death in Japan. However, cancer examina-
tion rates in Japan are extremely low—the lowest among OECD member nations.
* For this reason, FUJIFILM as a medical care company started 
the Fujifilm Group Cancer Examination Rate Improvement Project in fiscal 2010, targeting employees of Fujifilm Group companies and their fam-ily. Based on its experience with the Pink Ribbon Movement, action will be taken to promote awareness of medical examinations for five cancer types—stomach, lung, intestinal, cervical and breast cancer.
The project began with the opening of the Cancer Examination 
Awareness Page on FUJIFILM’s intranet in late May. The page features basic information on cancer and a list of medical hospitals. A booklet rec-ommending cancer examination is also being circulated in workplaces. Starting in June, internal seminars on the various cancer types are being held to directly communicate to employees the distinctive characteristics of cancer and the importance of medical examinations. For breast cancer, examinations during work hours are scheduled to be held at all busi-ness sites and offices, making use of the mammography examination vehicles.
Furthermore, we plan to minimize the physical pain of examination 
by encouraging use of FUJIFILM’s nasotracheal endoscopy system for stomach cancer examination and offer follow-ups to those undergoing secondary examinations, in order to achieve “quality of examination” along with improvements in the examination rate, and to contribute to the early detection of cancer for our employees and their dependents.

European Regional Environmental Meeting in progress
2009 Smile Walk
In June 2010, I attended the European Regional Environmental Meeting 
held at FUJIFILM Manufacturing Europe B.V., in Tilburg, The Netherlands. Speaking on behalf of FUJIFILM head office, I reported that preservation of biodiversity had been added to the fiscal 2010 Fujifilm Group Green Policy and gave a presentation on reinforcement of global warming coun-termeasures that is a top action item and on promoting environmentally friendly design. The representatives of Europe and the various companies in the region reported on their respective state of action and shared in-formation.
The leading manufacturing-related companies in Europe are plan-
ning to establish consolidated environmental targets, and the detailed presentations given by the European partners chiefly in the areas of global warning countermeasures and waste reduction had been extremely in-formative and productive. Also, information was exchanged in the area of chemical substance control, including REACH compliance in Europe. ʫʫ  Participating in the European Regional Environmental MeetingVOICE
Through these discussions, we were able to confirm that our affiliates 
in Europe, including sales companies, are working in concert in this area.
By attending the meeting, I was able to confirm that our affiliates in 
Europe are working together as one by taking advantage of their regional characteristics and producing greater and more results. I sincerely look forward to further progress in their activities and, on behalf of FUJIFILM head office, will support their environmental protection activities in Europe.

Every year from 1991 to 2007,  Fujifilm Group had been holding in-
terna tional meeti ngs of environmental officers of the Fujifilm Group at 
FUJIFILM head office.  The meeting has served as the venue for environ-
mental mana gement officers of affilia tes in Japan and other countries to 
share informa tion on environmental policies implemented and promoted on 
a worldwide scale,  as well as to discuss action policies,  with attention given 
to the key action items in the Group`s environmental policy, Fujifilm Group 
Green Policy. Since 2008,  regional headquarters has been now able to take 
action and promote environmental activities that are designed to adapt to 
regional characteristics,  we have reconstructed into lCore Group Meetingsz 
consisting of FUJIFILM head office and regional headquarters.  The Core 
Group Meetings have begun to serve as the opportunity for in-depth discus-
sion of the is sues affecting the entire corpora te group.  
With the involvement of FUJIFILM head office in these regional envi-
ronmental meetings as need arises,  the compan y has been able to com-
munica te the latest informa tion, such as the key items in the Fujifilm Group 
Green Policy, directly to the representa tives,  aiding in the sharing of values 
and principles that apply to the entire group and in reinforcing environmen-
tal governance.

FUJIFILM Holdings in domestic and interna tional ranking sur veys.As the compan y responsible for Fujifilm Group`s logistics in Japan, FUJIFILM 
logistics has been working on consolida ting the domestic shipping network 
in coopera tion with Fuji Xerox since October 2007.
At present,  configura tion of the shipping networks for western and 
eastern Japan* is near completion,  as a result of exhaustive safe driving and 
opera tion mana gement in coopera tion with the business partners respon-
sible for Fuji Xerox merchandise distribution,  cutting down shipping ﬂow 
lines,  boosting vehic le and loading efficiencies and consolida ting freight,  
such as joint shipment of machiner y and supplies.  As a result,  a cost re-
duction of roughly ¥250 million and a CO2 reduction of roughly 750 tons 
have been achieved from December 2008 when the project started up until 
March 31, 2010.  The changes made in shipping ﬂow line reductions and 
joint machiner y/supply shipments are sho wn on the right.
In the future,  a greater Tokyo shipping network and central Japan 
shipping network linking western and eastern Japan are to be developed 
to complete consolida tion. At the same time,  the mana gement organiza tion 
for domestic shipping will be integra ted as well. Furthermore,  freight ship-
ment logistics will be expanded from machiner y and supplies to parts and 
procured supplies and parts,  creating a logistics scheme  that connect sales 
and manufacturing by end of fiscal 2011.
Supplies shipment truck headed to regional warehouse A with a full load, including 
supplies for regional warehouses in Osaka and other regions.
Cross-dock supplies headed for Osaka and other regional warehouses are unloaded 
at the Western HUB, machinery headed for regional warehouse A is loaded onto the vacated space, returning with a full load.
Delivery on the route connecting THC, Western HUB and regional warehouse A can be 
completed with a single truck, resulting in a 1.7-fold increase in the load rate.*  Shipment network tha t efficiently connects cross dock centers,  regional warehouses and 
manufacturing centers,  centering around HUBs (hubs & spokes) in eastern and western Ja pan, 
which function as central warehouses for copiers,  accessories and other machiner y.ᶃ  Truck loaded with supplies coming from THC*
ᶄ  Two trucks loaded with machinery from the Western HUB go out on delivery every 
day, both with low load rates.

VOICE
An organization-wide project was formed in 
order to complete the consolidation of the domestic shipment network, and action was taken to resolve issues. However, it was nec-essary to solve many issues, including the lead time from order reception to shipment, synchronization of arrival times, unification of cargo load indicators, cost apportionment, compliance with laws, etc. In addition, activi-ties were implemented through collaboration between FUJIFILM Logistics and its cooper -ating business partners and freight owners, because of the need to build a trunk route network that does not compromise our goals of full-load truck operation and connecting ve-hicles. Through this, we were able to achieve great success.
In the future, a network covering the en-
tire country will be created and upgraded for the reorganization of the shipment network for the Fujifilm Group to contribute to logistics and a drastic reduction in CO
2 emission.ʫʫ Collaboration e xtending beyond divisions,  organizations and companies is essential

We hope you found this Sustainability Report useful. This 
year, the fourth year since the Fujifilm Group shifted to a holding company structure in October 2006, we com-pleted our system to conduct CSR activities based on a common CSR philosophy and values across the Group and began supporting the Group’s management targets through our CSR activities.
We planned and edited this report to introduce as 
many examples as possible of the CSR measures the Group has been implementing in its business operations. We were very pleased to find that the business divisions we interviewed presented examples of their CSR activi-ties to us, which demonstrates that the Group’s CSR philosophy and values are actually being implemented by employees at each of our sites. In editing this report, we felt that the CSR activities of the Fujifilm Group are shift-ing from the “ideal” to the “real.” 
We hope that this report will be read by many people, 
our stakeholders included, and that it gives readers a deep -
er understanding of the Fujifilm Group’s CSR activities.Editorial postscripts

contact/index.htm lAbout the illustrations on the front cover and section title pages
The Fujifilm Group is recording and storing cultural and artistic works 
in the form of photos and images to pass on to future generations. We do this as part of our social contribution through our business. Thanks to cooperation from the Mitsui Memorial Museum, we are presenting some of the works owned by the museum on the front cover and section title pages of this report.
The Earth on which we live is called the “planet of water” and the 
21st century is called the “century of water.” We used an image of hydrangeas, which mean “water barrels,” for the front cover, thinking about the importance of water for all life.
Mitsui Memorial Museum
Address:  Mitsui Main Building 7th Floor, Nihonbashi Muromachi 2-1-1, 
Chuo-ku, Tokyo 103-0022
URL: http://www.mitsui-museum.jp/english/english.htmlGold-lacquered Tea box with hydrangea design in Maki-e lacquer
Edo period (19th century)  
owned by the Mitsui Memorial Museum
This gold-lacquered tea box, on which branches of hydrangeas are dramatically 
depicted with the flowers, contains a set of tea things all made of silver. The box 
belonged to Retsu, the wife of Takanari, the 7th head of the Kita Mitsui family 
according to the explanatory document attached to the box. The flat red braid 
of the box is indeed feminine. The tea box with hydrangeas, which contains 
silver tea things looking refreshingly cool, is quite suitable for use in summer.
The annex building of Mitsui Bunko, where a lot of 
excellent Japanese and Oriental artistic works were 
stored, was moved to Nihonbashi, a place that is 
closely associated with the Mitsui family and the 
Mitsui Group, and was opened as the Mitsui Memorial 
Museum in October 2005. The artistic works owned 
by this museum were collected and have been passed 
down through the history of the Mitsui family that 
extends over 300 years since the Edo period. The 
collection forms a part of the precious Japanese 
cultural heritage.
The Mitsui Main Building in which the museum is 
located is a massive Western-style architecture that 
represents the buildings constructed in the early years 
of the Showa period. The building is designated as 
an important cultural property. The entrance of the 
museum is located at the atrium of the Nihonbashi 
Mitsui Tower , a skyscraper constructed adjacent to the 
Mitsui Main Building.
At the museum, the tea room named lJoan,z 
which is associated with the Mitsui family and is now designated as a national treasure, 
is exquisitely reproduced, and tea things are displayed in the room to show the beauty 
of a style, while Japanese and Oriental artistic works are displayed in the Western-style 
building to show visitors the beauty of forms and give them an opportunity to enjoy the 
essentials of cultur e and beauty .
