  Top Commitment
02◉FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation Sustainability Report 2013 FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation Sustainability Report 2013 ◉03Enhance further onsite capabilities  
in the workplace
In January 2014, Fujifilm will celebrate the 80th anni-
versary of our foundation. Since starting domestic pro-duction of photographic film based on self-developed technologies, the company has continued to make social contributions by developing and selling various materials and devices. Now, through this “second foundation,” the Fujifilm Group provides products ranging from ASTALIFT-branded cosmetics, the high-end X series digital camera for personal use to office printers, multifunctional devic-es, a series of highly functional materials, printing materi-als, and medical equipment for business use. We also of-fer a wide variety of products including pharmaceuticals.
The Fujifilm Group has now introduced its G-up ac-
tivities to enhance onsite capabilities in the workplace and to achieve its medium-term management plan VISION 80 for the continued growth of the Group. As the first precondition for a company to provide society with valuable products and continue to grow, it is vital that we  enhance onsite capabilities at each division and that all company employees work as professionals in their re-spective workplaces.
Each of our 80,000 Group employees has his/her  
own workplace and each workplace has its own tasks for today and objectives for tomorrow. Through the G-up ac-tivities, I hope that all members of the Group will improve their ability to understand the essentials, introduce subtle changes in the workplace, and develop their problem-solving skills. To ensure our dreams become reality, we need to break down with teamwork, integrating the abili-ties of each individual into a strong and vigorous team. 
Meeting the diversified needs of society
The Fujifilm Group’s basic approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is to contribute to the sustain-able development of society by putting into practice the Fujifilm Group’s Corporate Philosophy: “Our overarch -
ing aim is to help enhance the quality of life of people worldwide with leading-edge, proprietary technologies, and realizing its Vision through sincere and fair business activities.” As one of the specific actions to be taken to achieve this, we set an environmental target to reduce lifecycle CO
2 emissions by 30% relative to 2005 by 2020, 
and have been working hard to attain this target. We have introduced a range of measures at our manufacturing facilities, including replacing the fuel for in-house power generation by natural gas, introducing renewable ener -
gies, and being proactive in developing and introducing energy-saving technologies. In our product development, we are also promoting our “Design for Environment” ini-tiative across all our businesses, while actively reducing the amount of CO
2 emitted by our products.
Reflecting the increase in the number of business 
fields and geographical regions in which we operate, the requests we are receiving from our stakeholders are be-coming more diversified. Now they are becoming stricter in their requests for us to achieve stable growth and return a profit for their investment, meet local social chal-lenges, and contribute to the sustainable development of society at large.  
In emerging economies in particular, although the 
countries as a whole are achieving rapid economic growth, local people are facing a range of social prob-lems, including a lack of food and drinking water, delays in building social infrastructure, and health disparities. By sharing these problems and giving support to finding solutions to the problems in these countries, we will not only contribute to the social development of the region but also find opportunities to create new business. 
Creating value and building society
It is of primary importance for a company to improve its corporate value, return a profit to society, and achieve sustainable growth as a going concern. To this end we must make better products, launch new businesses, and work to harmonize our aims with our customers and so-ciety at large.
At the beginning of the new fiscal year on April 1, 
2013, I sent out a message to all Group employees to encourage them to solve problems with a sense of own-ership. In order for the Fujifilm Group to continue to be a leading corporate entity, all of our employees need to see the various social problems occurring in the world, such as the depletion of resources and energy, climate change, and health disparities as their own issues, and both management teams and individual employees need to take action in their own workplace.
The Fujifilm Group’s raison d’etre is to contribute to 
the sustainable development of society by making use of a range of advanced and unique technologies developed by the company. Acknowledging this, we will continue to take on the challenge of fostering continuing innovation into the future.Living out 10 years of crisis
Due to the Japanese government’s audacious financial measures and flexible fiscal policies launched at the end of last year, we are beginning to see signs of a breaka-way from the long-lasting deflation and high appreciation of the yen. If all companies, including ourselves, play their roles in line with the growth strategy implemented by the government to foster private investment, the “three arrows” fired by the government will together help Japan get back on the track to growth. To achieve this, both the public and private sectors need to make even more effort.
During the decade of deflation and the strong yen, 
the Fujifilm Group also faced a sharp decrease in de-mand for photographic film, which once represented the company’s core business field. Because of the faster than expected acceleration of digitization, global de-mand for photographic film continued to decrease after reaching its peak in 2000, and subsequently in 2011, the demand dropped to only 5% of the peak. We then found ourselves facing triple difficulties: an endangered core business, deflation, and a strong yen. To overcome these difficulties, the management team and employees in the Group made a concerted effort to implement structural reforms and develop new business. Through this “second foundation” to transform the crisis into a business op-portunity, the Fujifilm Group has transformed itself into a corporate entity with a wide spectrum of businesses. 
On the international front, emerging economies have 
achieved remarkable growth and driven the globalization of the world economy during these past 10 years. China outstripped Japan in terms of GDP in 2010 and became the world’s second largest economic power. The ASEAN countries, Brazil, Russia, India, Turkey, and African countries are also continuing their growth. Under these circumstances the Japanese government has concluded economic partnership agreements (EPA) with a range of countries and is making preparations to participate in Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, which is providing proactive support for companies in expanding their businesses on a global scale. In its rapid response to these changes, Fujifilm has also increased its bases and staff mainly in emerging economies, and is expand-ing its businesses to reflect the local situation in each country and region.

The Fujifilm Group has been creating new values and expanding its businesses by taking the lead  
in challenging social problems with a dynamic attitude that may even cause a paradigm shift  in our own business. The Group’s history is marked by a series of innovations, realized by the corporate principle of “Seek what society truly needs and respond with continuous innovation.”
In order to offer fundamental solutions to various social problems currently facing us  and realize a sustainable society, we need to make breakthroughs—novel solutions that  transcend conventional ideas. Further, to offer such solutions as products or services,  both the passion of each staff member involved in the work and the technology to  integrate the solution with the product or service are indispensable. The Special Features  in this issue introduce the people and technologies behind the innovations in our  business—which seeks to resolve global social problems.
The Fujifilm Group regards the following six 
businesses as its priority business fields: digital imaging, healthcare, highly functional materials, graphic systems, optical devices, and document solutions. These are fields in which we can demonstrate our strengths in terms of technology and market position. These fields are also in high social demand, and, therefore, we can expect high growth. Health, energy, and information are the key social elements today to support a sustainable society, and there are many related issues to be addressed. Our healthcare, highly functional materials, and document solutions businesses are closely linked to these elements—which is why we have positioned these three businesses as core businesses to drive  our overall enterprise.Pioneering the Future through Innovation

⇒  With the introduction of  patient-friendly transnasal endoscopes, we are contributing to the 
creation of  an environment in which people can undergo an endoscopy without hesitation, and 
in which  stomach  cancers and other stomach diseases can be identified at an early stage.
⇒  We offer a range of individual-based energy-saving activities and solutions in 
offices that are struggling to reduce CO 2 emissions.
⇒  If electricity can be generated from the unused heat emitted in our daily 
lives, a large amount of recycled energy would become available.
⇒  We have significantly lessened the environmental impact in the printing 
process by eliminating the use of particular materials and reducing the 
energy used in plate development.Transoral endoscopy has long been the standard practice for gastric examinations. However, we have commercialized an endoscope thin enough to pass through the nasal passage, lessening the patient’s discomfort. 
Without relying on the  same energy saving activities taking place across 
the company, individual workers also conduct their own energy saving measures to suit their individual working styles and environments.
Use of thermoelectric conversion has been limited to satellites and nuclear 
reactors using hard and heavy materials. We have developed a light and flexible material that can offer thermoelectric conversion in our daily lives.
Offering an innovative solution that goes beyond our own product field by 
completely eliminating the conventional plate development process.
STAKEHOLDER MESSAGEIt was 2004 when I first started using a tran-
snasal endoscope in our hospital. In fact, this technology was still very much in its early stages. Although the rate of occurrence of gastric cancer was already high in Japan at that time, patients were reluctant to undergo gastroscopic examinations—even when I recommended them to do so. Frustrated with their unnecessary fear of endoscopy, I thought I should contribute to spreading the use of transnasal endoscopy to change patients’ views. Transnasal endoscopes are available on the market from several different companies. Among these manufacturers, Fujifilm has a very clear sales approach: “Spread the use of transnasal endoscope to reduce the burden on patients.” Their sincere attitude to their products impressed me and because of this I decided to take a part in their promotion. 
Fujifilm’s transnasal endoscope is very soft 
and therefore much less aggressive to pa-tients’ bodies. However, there are still some points I would like to see improved. For ex -
ample, improvements to its lens cleaning and suction power will reduce the examination time, which in turn alleviates patient discom-fort as well as lessening the burden of the en-doscopy technicians. I hope that Fujifilm will continue to advance their technology to make the transnasal endoscope even friendlier to both patients and doctors.

Searching for patient-friendly value
The transnasal endoscopes offered by Fujifilm were developed with the aim of reducing the 
physical distress of patients who need to receive internal examinations. Endoscopy, which can directly observe the stomach lining, is very effective in detecting gastric cancer early. However, people avoid endoscopy because they are reluctant to accept the physical discomfort of an -
esthesia and the pharyngeal reflex that causes gagging. It was a request by a French surgeon who wished to reduce such physical distress among patients that prompted Fujifilm (then Fujinon) to commence developing a transnasal endoscope in 1999.
The pharyngeal reflex is caused by the endoscope touching the tongue root, but this de -
creases if the endoscope is inserted through the nasal cavity. The physical burden on the body by anesthesia can also be reduced because only a small amount of anesthetic is required to paralyze the nasal passageway. Although transnasal endoscopes have been developed by other manufacturers, the demand for them was relatively low because it was difficult to convince both doctors and patients to accept the idea of inserting a tube through the nose. Regardless of such difficulties, Fujifilm continued its research and development of a transnasal endoscope.  Mr. Maruhashi, the Research Manager of the Medical System Research & Development Center, described the determination of researchers at that time, saying, “We found great value in trying to reduce the patients’ burden.”
Numerous improvements realized transoral endoscope-class performance
Although transnasal endoscopes bring significant benefits to patients, there were a number of technical issues to be resolved to make it into a commercially viable product. The diameter of the insertion part must be much smaller than that of a transoral endoscope for it to pass through the nasal passage. The diameter is actually 5.9 mm, and its surface area is only a third that of a transoral endoscope. In this narrow area, a camera, light, and a suction nozzle must be equipped, while achieving image quality equivalent to a transoral endoscope. Keeping up with the perform -
ance of the transoral endoscope has been the history of developing the transnasal endoscope.
Fujifilm released its first transnasal endoscope in 2001, and continued to improve the prod -
uct by listening to opinions from a wide range of parties through different opportunities, such as the Transnasal Endoscope Liaison Meetings. Finally, our benchmark product, the EG-580NW, was launched in 2011. It offers a vivid and high quality image enabled by our original Super CCD Honeycomb image sensor, with a field of view widened from 120° to 140°, giving equivalent performance to a transoral endoscope. Until the introduction of the EG-580NW, it had been said that a transnasal endoscope had a lower chance of detecting gastric cancer due to the poorer image quality compared to a transoral endoscope. It was reported that the chance of detecting cancer is not difference by these improvements, and doctors who actually used the product commented to us that the EG-580NW had achieved a step up in medical examination reliability.Transnasal endoscope awareness activities win end user recognition
As well as the technical issues, the established concept in medical practice that an endoscope should be inserted through the mouth was quite an obstacle to disseminating our transnasal products. Whether endoscopy is necessary or not is determined by a doctor. However, our products had a very slow startup because doctors remained unnecessarily skeptical about the quality and performance of transnasal endoscopes. Fujifilm decided to try awareness activities to the patients themselves. Various advertisements communicated that transnasal endoscopy was a less aggressive procedure and our websites introduced the clinics and hospitals where transnasal endoscopy was available. 
As a result of this promotion, the number of patients who choose transnasal endoscopy 
increased. 
Also, in a questionnaire completed by over 5,000 patients who received transnasal endos-
copy, 95% answered that the endoscopy was “easy,” and 96% said they would “choose transna -

At the same time, we hosted a number of Transnasal Endoscopy Liaison Meetings, which 
provide lectures by doctors who actually use transnasal endoscopes and other seminars to raise understanding of transnasal endoscopes among doctors, working together with FUJIFILM Medical Co., Ltd., the group company that sells transnasal endoscopes. Advice from doctors with hands-on experience in transnasal endoscopy is highly convincing for those medical insti -
tutes considering introducing transnasal endoscopes. We have been continuing these aware -
ness raising activities by doctors for doctors, through hosting at least two seminars each month. To date, our promotion has successfully made the benefits of transnasal endoscopy known to many doctors, in terms of both performance and patient-friendliness. Now transnasal endo-scopes are in operation in approximately 7,000 medical institutions in Japan. 
* Survey by Japanese Red Cross 
Shizuoka Hospital in 2008.In 2011, 357,305 people died from cancer in 
Japan.* Out of this number, approximately 50,000 people died from gastric cancer—the second commonest type of cancer in Japan. However, gastric cancer is very treatable if detected at an early stage, which is why regular checkups for cancer should be encouraged. It has also been found that Helicobacter pylori treatment and ap -
propriate follow-up using an endoscope can re -
duce gastric cancer development. This makes it even more important to increase the number of people receiving gastric cancer screening.

C  olumn   Fujifilm Promotes Mammography in the Middle EastSTAKEHOLDER MESSAGEAiming for endoscopy that patients can receive without hesitation
Doctors cannot talk with their patients during 
gastroscopy, although patients’ facial expres-sions often let doctors know that they are in some discomfort—I have long been frustrated with this fact. If the endoscopy experience makes the patient feel that they never want to go through the ordeal again, then this in-creases the risk of delaying the discovery of a possibly serious condition. To reduce this burden on patients, I adopted Fujifilm’s first transnasal endoscope in 2002. Handling these endoscopes was quite tricky at the beginning, but operability has significantly improved since then. 
The reliability of transnasal endoscopes in identifying lesions is now well established. The next step is to promote endoscopy among patients so that they accept it more readily. If endoscopy becomes more widely available in local clinics, cancers can be found in their early stages, and geographical disparities in medical treatment can be reduced. This can be realized by using transnasal endoscopes, which deliver safe examinations while patients remain fully conscious. I hope that transnasal endoscopes will become even easier to oper -
ate so that more doctors will start to use them. I am sure that sometime soon the majority of patients will receive their first gastroscopy us-ing the less aggressive transnasal endoscope.

Various awareness activities 
targeted at patientsChallenges related with  
mammography availability
The number of women who develop breast cancer is increas -
ing worldwide. In Europe and the U.S., the occurrence rate of 
breast cancer is increasing, but the death rate is decreasing because of the mammography availability. This suggests that deaths from breast cancer can be prevented if it is identified early enough and treated appropriately.
However, in emerging countries, mammography, which is 
so effective in identifying breast cancer, is slow in becoming commonly available due to a lack of human resources. To ana -
lyze a mammogram, a radiographer who actually take the mammogram and a radiologist who then analyzes the image are required. A lack in the number or skills of either specialist may lead to overlooking the cancer or an erroneous diagnosis. In the Middle East and Africa region, the number of women who voluntarily undergo mammography is increasing thanks to breast cancer awareness raising activities, such as the Pink Ribbon campaign. Unfortunately, this uptake of mammogra -
phy does not contribute sufficiently to a reduction in the death rate because of the insufficient number of doctors and techni -
cians and their lack of skills. To help resolving such issues, the Fujifilm Group provides a range of support to improving mam -
mographic diagnoses in different countries, as well as making mammographic equipment more widely available.
Case study 1:  
Improving mammogram analysis skills in Jordan
The Jordanian government started the Breast Cancer Program in order to improve the analytic skills of radiologists in the country, as well as increasing the number of women who at -
tend mammographic screening. The first educational session was conducted in March 2012, with lectures given by five doc -
tors well experienced in mammography diagnoses invited from the U.S. Around 200 to 250 doctors from Jordan learned the skills of reading mammographic images by assessing numer -
ous cases under the instruction of the lecturing doctors, and the session ended with successful learning results.
Fujifilm contributes to this project by providing 20 devices 
and mammography workstations free of charge.
In response to this positive outcome, Jordan is consider -
ing expanding the program to neighboring countries. A pro -
gram with an estimated 400 to 500 attendants from the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, etc. is now expected to take place in October 2013. Fujifilm plans to continue assisting in this program by providing 40 devices without charge. In rec -
ognition of our support for the Breast Cancer Program, FUJIFILM Middle East FZE (FFME) received an award from the Jordanian government.
Case study 2:  
Improving mammography skills in the U.A.E.
Inexperience in mammographic procedures not only leads to 
erroneous diagnoses due to excess X-ray levels and unclear images, but also generates greater carcinogenic risks from ra -
diation overdoses. To help disseminate correct mammograph -
ic techniques in the Middle East and Africa, Fujifilm hired a skilled radiographer with 20 years of experience in Germany to develop a new educational program. The program was pre -
sented to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in the U.A.E. and is provided to existing radiographers and trainees at no cost. The education program has now been officially ap -
proved by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in the U.A.E., and it is also a mandatory program when renewing the radiographer’s license. 
Fujifilm is continuing its assistance to the program because we 
believe that what we should deliver to these emerging coun -
tries is not just mammographic equipment but also techniques and education in mammography, and that this is our mission as a medical equipment sales company in this region.We started holding seminars in China in autumn 2012. We are demonstrating the practicality of 
transnasal endoscopes aiming to expand our overseas sales.
For further expansion of transnasal endoscope usage
Recently, it has been found that the patients infected with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) have higher risk of gastric cancer.* Treatment of H. pylori can be the subject of medical insurance only when the patient suffers from stomach or duodenal ulcers. This stipulation was revised in February 2013 and now insurance applications have been extended to cover chronic gastritis. Endoscopy is required to diagnose chronic gastritis, and to regularly monitor the recovery progress after treatment. For this reason, the less-aggressive transnasal endoscope is expected to be chosen by more patients.
It is thought that 60 million people are infected with H. pylori in Japan, and the extension of 
the said health insurance coverage will increase the number of endoscopy procedures. However, the next challenge is the shortage of doctors experienced in transnasal endoscopy, as the edu -
cation system for transnasal endoscopy is less established than that for transoral endoscopy. To address this issue, Fujifilm offers seminars to doctors and nurses who prepare the nasal area before endoscopy, cooperating with doctors and medical institutions with expertise in transna -
sal examinations.
We seek to make a positive contribution to people’s healthy and rich lives by providing 
patient-friendly medical equipment. With this aim in mind, Fujifilm continues to develop and promote the usage of transnasal endoscopes.HealthcareSpecial

continuous energy conservation
As part of its efforts toward the prevention of global warming, Fuji Xerox announced 2020 Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions Reduction Targets in 2009. Fuji Xerox pledged to reduce its CO 2 emissions throughout 
the entire product lifecycle of its products by 30% compared to fiscal 2005 by 2020, and to provide solu -
tions which offer new working styles in order to reduce our customers’ CO 2 emissions by seven million 
tons annually by 2020. To achieve these targets, we have been implementing reduction measures by providing energy-conserving products in our core businesses of multifunction devices and printers. However, in order to produce significant results toward achieving the reductions targets, from our con -
clusion that it is essential to introduce measures to reduce energy consumption for the entire office, we began to provide solution services to reduce office energy consumption. One of the results of this was the “EneEyes—a self-analysis system to visualize energy consumption” verification experiment conduct -
ed at the Fuji Xerox R&D Square building, which opened in March 2010. At first, we planned to proceed with the EneEyes energy conservation verification experiment gradually over three years starting from 2011, but due to the limitations on summer electrical power use in the area supplied by the Tokyo Electric Power Company introduced in the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake, the project schedule was suddenly brought forward so that results could be produced from efforts made in the summer of 2011. 
The number of companies which have introduced systems to display data on the amount of electri -
cal power being used in real-time is increasing, with the goal of raising energy conservation awareness among employees. We also considered proposals to install such displays in areas such as the entrance hall and cafeteria and other areas where lots of employees gather together in the Fuji Xerox R&D Square building. However, the approach of putting this data in a graph and displaying it could not be expected to produce any effect other than to demonstrate the current situation. We concluded that to stimulate and encourage action for energy conservation among our employees, it was necessary to both “visualize” the data and to enable all employees to analyze their energy consumption from various perspectives them -
selves in order to implement actions that they found convincing and worthwhile. What sort of information should we communicate, then, and in what way should we communicate it in order to stimulate and encourage autonomous action by our employees to conserve energy? Firstly, we decided to “visualize” the issues of energy conservation by making people aware of the current situation and the extent of the gap with our targets. Then we aimed to have employees think up solutions and display the effects of the measures they implemented. We thought that adding a function to enable our employees to analyze the data themselves would make continuous action to conserve energy possible. We have developed the EneEyes to make a system to visualize the series of processes from raising the issues of energy conser -
vation to confirming the effect of measures taken and make it possible for our employees to analyze the data independently themselves.
Achieving reductions in annual CO 2 emissions of approximately 30%  
for fiscal 2011
We spent three months in preparation, aiming for the launch of operations in July to be ready for the curbs on summer electrical power use. First, we decided on the persons who would be responsible on each floor and each department for constructing a system that our employees could operate independ -
ently. We analyzed the actual past results for electrical power use by each department using EneEyes and we set targets for each floor and for the entire building. Then implementation measures were pro -
posed to achieve the targets, with a central role being played by each person responsible for their re -
spective floor or department. The energy conservation menu was determined autonomously by each department by setting priorities in accordance with the extent of the impact on its business operations and a trial was conducted. By repeating this process which allowed us to confirm the effects immediately, we refined the content to find the most effective menu. As a method of supporting energy conservation, 
The proportion of energy consumed by 
an office with 50 employees accounts for nearly 70% of the CO
2 emissions 
within the building, of which the use of air conditioners, lighting and outlets alone account for almost 60%. Fuji Xerox R&D Square A new base for research and develop -

tion is that the amount of CO 2 emissions produced by business operations 
departments (such as in office buildings, etc.) is certainly not decreasing and is on an increase trend,* due to the impact of the spread of office automation devices, such as computers, etc. At a time when energy conservation coun -
termeasures for office buildings have reached an impasse, in order to push forward with further energy conservation, it is fair to say that a fundamental revision of approach, to one which enables a combination of energy conser -
vation and reasonable, stress-free working styles, is required.

we also introduced a function that automatically sends a warning message by email if the use of electrical 
power goes beyond a certain level. But by using EneEyes there was no need to coerce people into con -
serving energy since our employees in the workplace analyzed the structure of energy consumption themselves and were able to get a concrete image by confirming the effect of the measures, which boosted their energy conservation efforts and led to them produce significant effects. 
Fuji Xerox’s R&D Square building was built to consider the environment even from the design stage, 
as an energy conservation building emitting 35% less CO
2 compared to conventional buildings. There 
was concern that trying to achieve a target of further conserving energy even beyond this was too harsh a demand to make of our employees. But by being able to encourage our employees to take autono -
mous actions to conserve energy, we were able to clear the standards for the curbs on electrical power usage without having to change to a staggered working hour system or make additional new investments in facilities or equipment. The electricity consumption for July and August 2011 marked a reduction of approximately 30% on the consumption for the same months in fiscal 2010 and the annual CO
2 emis -
sions in fiscal 2011 marked a reduction of approximately 30% on the previous year. The original plan had been to conduct a verification experiment of energy conservation using EneEyes lasting over three years, but because we were able to involve all our employees at R&D Square in energy conservation activities in the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake, we were able to improve the methods of data col -
lection and processing and verify the effects of the application of EneEyes in the space of just one year, as well as achieve our energy conservation target of a 30% reduction in annual CO
2 emissions.
In fiscal 2011, we set a limit on the amount of peak electrical power used in one day, and we were 
able to clear our target for this too. But in fiscal 2012, we reviewed our plan again and set a target for reducing the annual average, in order to maintain our actual results from 2011 and firmly establish energy conservation in our working styles. In fiscal 2013 too, we intend to continue with our energy conservation efforts. 
EneEyes: Embodying the challenge of “unity of word and deed promotion”
Through the introduction of EneEyes, we were able to confirm the effects of measures by grasping the current situation of energy usage. But it is not possible to achieve energy conservation or major reduc -
tions in electrical power usage from this alone. The biggest feature of EneEyes is the encouragement and stimulation of autonomous energy conservation actions among employees brought about by its visuali -
zation function, so that each one of our employees looked hard at their working styles and the content of their work from the perspective of energy conservation, and put energy conservation into practice in their own duties. 
The effects of energy conservation measures are displayed in figures approximately 10 minutes 
after their being implemented. Being able to confirm the effects in this manner raises the motivation levels of employees and encourages them to raise issues, think up solutions themselves, and put them into action, leading to further refinement of the content of the measures and creating a continuously and smoothly revolving virtuous cycle. Being able to see the effects of measures they had taken for them -
selves meant that our employees were convinced by the results and moved on to take the next step based on them. Also, we verified that it was possible for our employees to reduce energy usage by 30% by conducting energy conservation in accordance with their own working styles and at a reasonable Left to right: Demo display 
mode, Interactive display mode, and Analysis display mode
pace, without any unnecessary stresses or waste. This also made it possible for us to conduct continu -
ous energy conservation activities, whose effects continued beyond the verification period.
At Fuji Xerox, we follow our principle of conducting “unity of word and deed promotion,” by first tak -
ing on all the challenges ourselves, and then making proposals to our customers based upon our own 
experiences. The spirit of our “unity of word and deed promotion” is certainly alive in the operation of the EneEyes project. 
These sorts of energy-saving measures and the energy conservation policy devised to suit actual 
business operations and implemented with our employees as the key actors was evaluated highly and EneEyes has received several awards including the 2012 Good Design Award. However sophisticated the technology used in constructing and equipping a building may be, as long as the people using it lack environmental awareness, it certainly cannot be said to be substantially addressing environmental is -
sues. Employees need to be allowed to think up measures to implement themselves, which match their new working styles. EneEyes is also able to act as a tool to assist in the creation of such new working styles. 
Deployment of environmental solutions to transform working styles
Fuji Xerox’s energy conservation activities are not limited to curbing energy consumption in terms of “hardware” such as buildings; we also offer “software” solutions by helping to transform working styles. In the future, based on our know-how and experience gained at the R&D Square, we intend to go on to deploy this approach in our other offices and in our overseas bases, etc. At the same time we would like to contribute to the transformation and reform of social systems through new working styles by support -
ing our customers in transforming their working styles and develop mechanisms which match their indi -
vidual needs, in order to realize our target of “reducing the annual CO
2 emissions of our customers by 
seven million tons by 2020.” 
Currently at Fuji Xerox we are deploying environmental solutions such as the environment impact 
observation system, which visualizes the energy used by the entire office by incorporating information such as the CO
2 emissions per person based upon actual individual results from using photocopiers and 
printers, and electrical power usage information from office lighting and PCs, etc. With the addition of know-how accumulated from using EneEyes to improve business operations put into practice by our employees themselves, our next target is to deploy new solutions services. By reducing the amount of electrical power and paper used in multifunctional devices and expanding solutions to reduce the envi -
ronmental impact of the entire office, we want to go on to make proposals based on our practical experi -
ence that constitute “unity of word and deed promotion.”
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is an urgent task for international society and we must ac -
celerate the speed with which we are reforming and transforming social systems for this purpose. This is not a task that can be achieved by any single company alone and technology development based on a variety of industry, academia and government collaboration is essential to its achievement. Fuji Xerox is actively participating in study groups involving industry-academic collaboration, such as the Todai Sustainable Campus Project (TSCP) and intends to continue to contribute to improving the earth’s global environment.Contributing to our customers’

If we are going to develop technology, let’s develop world-leading technology
Development of the flexible thermoelectric conversion module began from about three years ago, when 
I had just become a Fellow at Fujifilm and was searching through ideas that had accumulated in a drawer from when I was a researcher, to see if I couldn’t find something that could become a new pioneering technology, something that we could be number one leader in compared to other companies, something that could be the next step in innovative research, ahead of all the other research in the laboratory. The key points in selecting a research theme were for it to be something that made use of both my own area of technological expertise and Fujifilm’s core technologies and that could go on to become a business which could contribute to society in the future.
Heat is being released wastefully or disposed of all around us every day, in every aspect of our lives. 
Approximately 80% of energy used in Japan is generated from fossil fuels but only one-third of that en -
ergy is put to effective use. The remaining two-thirds is disposed of or released as waste heat together with CO
2. If this CO 2 and waste heat is not reused, it constitutes our biggest final industrial waste prod -
uct. I wondered if it might be possible to effectively use this unused heat, and in particular the waste heat at medium to low temperatures (200°C or less) which is considered to be the hardest to collect, in order to offer a solution to the energy issue. But how could it be used? What if we converted it into electricity and made it transportable? This was the line of thinking with which this research began. 
In fact, the thermoelectric conversion module is a technology that has been researched since over 
50 years ago. However, the materials used for the conventional thermoelectric conversion module were mainly inorganic, contained rare metals and toxic metals and were both heavy and hard. They were not suited for use by ordinary companies whose purpose was to spread the use of the technology. But what if we used one of Fujifilm’s strengths—organic materials—as a material for it, which would be more suited to spreading the technology? The advantages of organic materials also include the fact that they are light, flexible and easy to process and that we can apply Fujifilm’s existing film technologies for coating and printing, etc. Furthermore, they do not use rare metals and so this would also contribute to both environ -
mental conservation and low costs. In the materials development industry, the general belief was that organic materials could not possibly be used as thermoelectric conversion materials so it was an area of research unprecedented in the world. However, there is no value in researching any technology if you know from the start that it is possible. There is only any meaning in conducting research if and because it is about challenging something that has never been done or developed before.
Aiming for practical use across a broad range of fields,  
by making use of the properties of lightness and flexibility
In developing the product for practical use, from consideration of the special features of organic materi-
als, we targeted the development of a product that would function using both milliwatt and microwatt electrical power. The reason for doing so was that by using soft and light organic materials, it would be possible to utilize the medium- and low-temperature waste heat that surrounds us all in our daily lives, and to apply the product in a variety of forms, such as lighting, electronic products, and on the body, etc. For example, application to the health industry might also be possible, such as in health monitors that use body heat as the power source for sensors, etc. In addition to the thermoelectric conversion technology, there is still a need to improve surrounding technologies such as sensor technology, etc. so that it can be applied to products, but we believe that it is important to get the thermoelectric conversion technology itself out into the world at an early stage. Applications for the use of technology can grow and further leaps can be made when it is used and evaluated highly by society in general.
In the short period of three years since we embarked on the development of this technology, we 
already have in sight practical applications for this technology. But to accelerate the speed of application, since about one year ago, we have been conducting joint development with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). By utilizing our respective strengths—Fujifilm’s in materials technology, AIST’s in module development—we have been working in friendly competition to improve performance. The Japanese government has also focused its attention on this research to de -
velop thermoelectric conversion modules using organic materials, and various projects to “use the un -
used heat energy” are set to be launched.
Further spread of the application of organic materials in the field of green energy
In recent years, energy harvesting technology (environmentally considerate electrical power generation technology) is being focused on as a new technology to generate energy. The thinking behind this is to conduct local production for local consumption in electrical power generation by generating the electrical power that is needed from natural energy. Until now, however, concrete research into the specific materi -
als to use as the medium for electrical power generation has not made much progress. It is hoped that the flexible thermoelectric conversion module will be able to be deployed in this sort of technology too.
By studying in-depth the mechanisms of the world around us, a picture emerges of the sort of 
technologies that will be necessary for the future and what we should be aiming for. It is important to have an image or vision of the future as the ideal we are aiming for in conducting technological development. There are various issues and challenges that still need to be cleared as we work toward the application and deployment of this technology, but I hope we can go on to promote social contribution based upon the use and generation of environmentally considerate energy, by constructing a system of thermal man -
agement using various sorts of materials technology.At Fujifilm, in addition to flexible 
thermoelectric conversion modules, we are also developing other technologies to contribute to the generation of green energy, such as high-performance solar cell pigment and lithium ion cell materials, etc.It is a surprising fact that approximately 70% of the primary en -
ergy directly obtained from fossil fuels, etc. is lost or disposed of 
as “waste heat.” As the issues of resources and energy become increasingly more serious, Japan has focused its attention on this vast unused energy resource and is putting its efforts into devel -
op various forms of heat management technology, such as ther -
moelectric conversion technology, as well as heat storage, heat insulation and heat pump technologies, etc. For Japan, as a country which lacks natural resources, the current situation is that innovative technological development for unused heat ener -
gy is an area essential to the promotion of green innovation.

Part3Converting “Waste Heat” into Electrical Power
Fujifilm’s leading-edge, proprietary technologies displayed  
in Nano Tech 2013The system to generate electrical power by converting 
heat energy into electric energy. Electrical power is generated by affixing a film substrate coated with organic materials onto a heat source. Since it is possible to generate electricity from a temperature difference of even 1°C, electrical power can even be generated from the temperature difference between human body temperature and ambient temperature. It is expected that this technology will be able to be used in a wide variety of fields since it can be produced at low cost and is easily processed in an abundant array of ways. The device in the picture is a mechanism whereby a toy car moves in response to a sensor operating on the heat from a hand. 
Light and flexible characteristics Response to the heat of electric lightSTAKEHOLDER MESSAGEEnergy conservation led by industry, for society as a whole
When we discussed issues relating to flexible 
thermoelectric conversion modules, we discov-ered that what we were aiming for corresponded with the Fujifilm Group’s approach. We were very impressed by their exceptional enthusiasm for and commitment to the development of this technology, and therefore decided to conduct joint research with the Fujifilm Group. 
The performance of flexible thermoelectric 
conversion modules has improved 10-fold or more over these past few years. If we are able to make effective use of the vast quantities of waste heat being emitted to the environment from vari-ous waste sources by thermoelectrically convert-ing them, we will be able to conserve energy for the whole of society and contribute to the reali-zation of a low carbon society. At the same time, if it becomes possible to generate electricity from the waste heat constantly being generated all around us, we can expect the application of this technology to act as an independent source of electricity (independent dispersed power source) that does not depend on commercial electric-ity or batteries. By utilizing the full range of the Fujifilm Group’s film technologies, materials and process technologies in our joint research, we hope to become pioneers of a new industry, and furthermore that we, as members of industry, will be able to lead energy conservation for society.

performance and printing quality
FUJIFILM Global Graphic Systems Co., Ltd. began developing process-less CTP (abbreviation 
for “Computer to Plate”) plates in 2004 and released the PRO-T as its first process-less plate in 2006. Subsequently the company unveiled the 100% process-less CTP PRO-T3 (called XZ-R in Japan) in 2011, which is improved in terms of environmental performance as well as printing quality and stability. The process-less CTP technology eliminates the need of using a processor, thereby eliminating the generation of effluents and also helps reduce the use of electricity and space and the maintenance cost, and thus contributes to the reduction of both environmental impact and the entire printing cost.
Although the environmental performance of process-less CTP plates had been highly eval-
uated, the use was not easily spread because of the problem related to the printing quality. Process-less CTP systems are on-press development systems that do not require the use of a processor. In customers’ printing processes, a range of materials are used in addition to the printer, such as inks and paper and FUJIFILM Global Graphic Systems struggled to make its CTP plates robust enough to provide stable printing quality for any combinations of printing materials. Products for the printing process were not included in the general product scope of the Fujifilm Group and the company therefore faced great difficulties. The members in charge, however, worked to make improvements to the plates step by step to mitigate the concerns of customers who demand high printing quality.
Making donations to WaterAid to publicize the Fujifilm Group’s 
environmental friendliness
At present, the PRO-T3 has been increasing its market share mainly in Europe with its over -
whelming environmental performance and printing quality, and about 1,000 companies in 
Europe, 600 in the Americas, and 350 in Japan or about 2,000 companies in the world have already introduced the product. At first, however, we needed to implement a campaign to pro -
mote the sales of the process-less CTP plates across the world in consideration of the product features. To this end, we formulated a strategy to promote the sales first in Europe, where people are highly environmental aware, by highlighting the environmental performance of the PRO-T3, which is the outstanding feature of the product.
Process-less CTP plates help reduce the amount of water used in the development proc -
ess, and the company decided to donate part of proceeds from the PRO-T3 to WaterAid *
1, an 
organization engaged in the solution of problems related to water resources, as a means to publicize the features of the product and the Fujifilm Group’s approach to the environment. We have thus established a system to make social contributions in cooperation with customers. Also, we launched the special website for the product “PRO-T3.com” to directly introduce the environmental performance, printing quality and cost effectiveness of the product to small- to medium-sized printing companies, who are the targeted users of process-less CTP plates. In May 2012, we participated in drupa2012 *
2, one of the world’s largest exhibitions for the printing 
and media industry to promote the sales of the product. In the exhibition, the PRO-T3 received a great response, and the product has become widely known to people in Europe, who are generally highly aware of environmental issues.
At present, the Fujifilm Group is planning to hold environmental seminars across the world 
jointly with WaterAid. Through these initiatives to conserve the environment, we will foster the branding of the Group while also making contributions to the solution of global social problems to fulfill our role as a global company.

The company has developed the following two 
technologies, which create synergies to develop CTP plates with high quality and productivity:
Fine Particle Dispersion (FPD) technology 
New technology to make smooth imaging and higher strength of the image area compatible by dispersing fine particles on the photosensitive layer
Rapid Stable Start-up (RSS) technology
New technology to make two conflicting functions—higher strength of the image area and the non-image area removability compatible, thereby enabling high-speed and stable on-press imaging100% process-less CTP plates do not 
require the conventional processes, such as alkali development and gumming.Companies engaged in the printing industry, which 
uses a range of resources, energy, chemicals and agents in large amounts, are facing the need of im -
plementing environmental measures as one of their priority management issues. Accordingly the indus -
try has been making progress to reduce its environ -
mental impact, including the reduction of the use of films by the digitization of printing processes. Nonetheless, there still remains strong demand for environment-friendly products in the market, in par -
ticular in Europe, Japan and the United States, where people are highly aware of environmental is -
sues. For example, there is demand for process-less CTP plates, which eliminate the need of using a processor and thereby also eliminate the generation of waste liquids, as well as demand for chemical-free CTP plates, which help reduce the generation of waste liquids from the development process.The Social Issue and Its Background
Building win-win relations with 
customers in promoting sales in the markets of emerging economies
The PRO-T3 is indeed our flagship 
product in fulfilling our CSR. It is ur -
gently necessary to raise awareness and foster sales of the product in emerging economies as a means to help reduce the environmental impact of society as our corporate respon -
sibility. We need to meet a range of challenges in terms of technologies and environmental education, and I would like to meet them to build win-win relations with customers based on the concept of Creating Shared Value (CSV).
The PRO-T3 is the ultimate form 
of environment-friendly CTPs.
By developing the product, our 
company has expanded its business scope and we were able to learn about printer technologies in making efforts to improve process-less CTP plates. For the sake of society, I feel it quite meaningful to develop and spread the use of ultimately eco-friendly CTP plates. I would like to increase my printing expertise to further contribute to the reduction of the environmental impact of the entire industry.Haruo Nakano

Substantially shortening the time to delivery through the operation of the local production line in Europe
In addition to meeting the need of implementing a sales promotion strategy, we also worked to 
meet the challenge of shortening the time to delivery to spread the use of the PRO-T3 in Europe. At first, the plates were produced in Japan and then delivered to each country, but it took as many as three to four months to manufacture and deliver the ordered products to the destina -
tions. In order to shorten the time to delivery, a new CTP plate product line, which is equipped with leading-edge technologies and energy-saving equipment, was launched in FUJIFILM Manufacturing Europe B.V. (in the Netherlands), and thanks to this shift to local production, the time to delivery was shortened to one month. The new production line is equipped with our own developed circulation-type Co-generative Thermal Oxidzier (CTO) and other advanced energy-saving equipment, and wind power generation equipment is also being operated in the manu -
facturing facilities to proactively reduce the environmental impact of the production activity.

STAKEHOLDER MESSAGERaising environmental awareness of people in emerging economies for 
the solution of global environmental problems
In order to foster eco-friendly printing across the world, we need to formulate and implement our 
sales promotion strategies in consideration of local features and needs in each country. In Europe and the Unites States, we focus on process-less CTP plates. On the other hand in Japan, we also attribute importance to reducing the environmental impact of alkali development systems widely used in the country while promoting the introduction of the XR-1200F * developer 
waste reduction equipment as a solution to help achieve the reduction of environmental impact without making large-scale replacement of equipment. In most of emerging economies, there are no regulations on the disposal of waste liquids, and it is deemed important to reduce the equipment investment cost. The Fujifilm Group is working to raise people’s environmental aware -
ness in emerging economies, including Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil by introducing the Group’s eco-friendly products.
In order to foster the use of the products in emerging economies, we need to provide local 
people with environmental education, set the prices in an appropriate manner, and expand the robustness of the products. There are indeed a lot of challenges to be met to increase our shares in the markets. Environmental protection, however, is an important issue for the entire world and demand for eco-friendly products is steadily increasing. The Group will continue to implement the measures to provide total solutions for the reduction of environmental impact, in particular for a wider use of its process-less CTP plates and to develop new technologies.

I would like to increase our 
overseas market shares by working with the frontier spirit.
The PRO-T3 has already been ac -
cepted to a certain degree in Europe, 
but the global awareness of the prod-uct still needs to be increased, which I believe is very important for the com -
pany. I would like to promote the sales of this flagship product in emerging economies, including African coun -
tries and contribute to the growth of the company by meeting the challenge of fostering the development of eco-friendly products.Finding new business 
opportunities by making use of our environmental technologies
I had been engaged in the marketing 
of the PRO-T3 in a subsidiary in the United States until last October. In working there, I strongly felt that the share of the product was expanding because it provides both high environ-mental performance and high printing quality. In any country , there must  be needs for environmental improve -
ments and by continuing to pursue higher quality and environmental performance, I hope we will be able to find new business opportunities.

food is often difficult for the mostly rural 
population. Almost half of the people in Tanzania do not have access to safe water. Typically, women and children spend over two hours a day collecting water. Access to toilets is even lower—at just a quarter of the population. This is particularly problematic to health in densely populated, unplanned settle-ments. These issues have a big impact on health, with 20,000 children under five dying each year from preventable diarrhoeal diseases.
Fujifilm’s support has helped 
WaterAid introduce simple and low-cost technologies that are more sustainable in the long-term. These include a new type of pump designed to tackle the problem of emptying latrines in slums, and innovative mapping technology to record the location and condition of wa-ter points across the country.

As part of a continued drive to be as sustainable 
as possible, and support sustainability in the efforts of others, Fujifilm donated a percentage of the sales of every square metre of Brillia HD PRO-T3 plates sold in Europe, Middle East & Africa over the 12 month period from May 2012 to April 2013 to WaterAid. This organisation is an international charity dedicated to enabling the world’s poorest communities to access safe water and sanitation. It was chosen to reflect the fact that PRO-T3 completely eliminates the water used in the conventional plate production process. The final total raised over this 12 month period was €65,025, more than double the origi-nal target of €30,000, due to the success and growing popularity of PRO-T3 within this region. We want to promote social contribution indirectly by expanding our sales.(Keigo Yoshizawa and Graham Leeson, FUJIFILM Europe GmbH)

The Fujifilm Group’s business originated with photographic film, a 
product for which lots of clean water and fresh air are essential to the manufacturing process. It is also a product which requires customers to “buy on trust,” since they cannot try it out before -
hand. Thus, for the Fujifilm Group, an approach which emphasiz -
es environmental conservation and maintaining the trust of stake -
holders has been a major premise at the very foundations of our business activities. This approach is the starting point for our cor -
porate social responsibility (CSR) activities and continues to be passed down within our group, as the Fujifilm Group’s “DNA.” 
Following the shift to a holding company structure in 2006, 
the Fujifilm Group formulated its Corporate Philosophy and Vision under the theme, “Second Foundation.” Incorporating these ide -
as, we have also set forth the Fujifilm Group Charter for Corporate Behavior and the Fujifilm Group Code of Conduct, both of which apply to all Fujifilm Group companies. In the Charter for Corporate Behavior, we uphold five principles, including “Respect for Human Rights,” while in the Code of Conduct we define compliance as “more than simply not breaking the law and acting correctly in the light of common sense and ethics,” and declare that all Group employees, including senior executives, will conduct themselves in line with these action guidelines.
Moreover we have made the following statement to encour -
age all Fujifilm Group employees to commit themselves to the ful -
fillment of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in their daily busi -
ness operations: The Fujifilm Group’s Approach to CSR is to contribute to the sustainable development of society by putting into practice the Fujifilm Group’s Corporate Philosophy, and real -
izing its Vision through sincere and fair business activities. In or -
der to conduct specific activities by taking this approach, we an -
nounced the following six policy statements over the period from 2008 to 2010: Green Policy, Social Contribution Policy, Guidelines for Biodiversity, Procurement Policy, Quality Policy, and Occupational Health and Safety Policy. 
All Fujifilm Group companies in and outside Japan will con -

Holding an international environmental meeting in Japan 
and regional environmental meetings in North America, Europe and China
We are promoting our environmental activities by the establishment 
of an international environmental meeting (Core Group Meeting), where persons responsible for environmental matters at each regional management headquarters gather, and regional environmental meetings, where persons responsible for environmental matters at each company gather by region, as places for informing our subsidiaries about the priority issues related to the environment that Fujifilm’s head office has set, sharing the environmental issues faced by each company and working together toward resolutions through discussions. In addition to Europe and North America, we launched a regional environmental meeting in China in fiscal 2012, in which persons responsible for environmental matters at each company participate to deepen their understanding of the policy laid down by head office and discuss the environmental measures being implemented by each company. In addition, the 5th Core Group Meeting was held in Japan in Oct. 2012, with participation from China for the first time. We shared issues and discussions on the usage of environmental data concerning products on a worldwide basis and the operation of a regulatory tracking system for laws and regulations of each country and region.

FeatureCSR Management
For the smooth operation of the entire Group’s CSR activities, the 
Fujifilm Group established the CSR Committee chaired by the President of FUJIFILM Holdings. The Committee takes decisions to promote the CSR activities of the entire Group. The CSR Department of FUJIFILM Holdings, which is the Secretariat of the CSR Committee, is responsible ensuring rigorous CSR manage -
ment by the Fujifilm Group. The CSR Department prepares the ground for various activities, discloses information outside, com -
municates with stakeholders, supports the CSR activities of Group companies, and audits the CSR activities of the entire Group. 
The CSR department in each Group company prepares and 
implements plans for CSR activities according to the entire group policy, implements exhaustive compliance, implements manage -
ment of risks, communicates with stakeholders, and reports on activities to the FUJIFILM Holdings CSR Committee. The Group as a whole engages in CSR activities, following the PDCA cycle.
The Fujifilm Group has listed up CSR issues relating to 
sustainability and set priority issues to address in promoting CSR activities which accurately reflect the demands and expectations of society. In order to do so, it has considered the “Materiality of priority CSR issues,” based on the two axes of “Influence on the Fujifilm Group,” and “External evaluation,” which comprises the evaluation the Fujifilm Group would receive from society if it acted in response to the expectations or requests of society, industrial criteria and legal compliance. To support the achievement of the medium-term management plan VISION 80, and with the aim of improving our corporate evaluation by combining both the growth of our business and reducing environmental and social impacts, using the “Materiality of priority CSR issues,” we have formulated the Medium-Term CSR Plan which sets “Climate change,” “Chemical substance management,” “Human resources development,” “Information disclosure and dialogue,” “Social and cultural contribution,” and “Biodiversity,” as its priority issues. 
Companies conduct their activities while interacting and main -
taining relations with a wide variety of stakeholders, and it is im -
portant to listen carefully to their various views and expectations. 
At the Fujifilm Group, we ensure that we make appropriate infor -
mation disclosures as well as verifying, at various opportunities, whether or not our business activities are responding to the de -
mands and expectations of all our stakeholders, and reflecting our findings in our business activities. To ensure that our stake -
holders’ views are reflected in our CSR activities, we also review them in our Sustainability Report.In addition to opinions relating to our CSR activities as a whole, regarding priority issues such as the promotion of anti-global warming measures, the promoting body for each issue conducts briefings on the content of the activities and presents the respec -
tive report to external parties, to receive their advice and evalua -
tion*. Looking back over our activities and obtaining the views of external parties in this way provides a good opportunity to reex -
amine our activities. We plan to continue with these efforts to promote our CSR activities in the future.

Arising from Fujifilm Group Activities
  *1  Environmental burdens due to raw materials procurement (CO 2 emitted 
during the process of extracting, transporting, refining, synthesizing, 
processing, and transporting raw materials) is calculated for the main raw materials procured.
  *2  Environmental burdens due to product manufacture is calculated based on the total amount of energy (electricity, petroleum, and gas) consumed in the production process.
  *3  For the calculation of environmental burdens due to product transportation, estimates are made based on domestic and overseas transportation methods and distances traveled. The typical amount of CO
2 emissions per unit of weight and distance for each method and 
correction factors such as the yield rate are multiplied by the weight of the raw materials procured.
  *4  For copy machines, printers, and fax machines, environmental burdens due to use of products is calculated as energy consumption for a 5-year period for the machines installed this year. For other products, the estimated number of machines in operation is multiplied by typical energy consumption.
  *5  Environmental burdens due to product disposal is calculated based on the estimation of stress on the environment caused by the disposal of the raw materials procured.
  *6  Wastewater released as a result of business activities
  *7  Volume released to public water
  *8  Total of heavy oil A, heavy oil C, kerosene, light diesel oil, and gasoline (Amounts of the petroleum-based products are summed after appropriated energy conversions, and the total is expressed in terms of the amount of heavy oil A.)
  *9  Total of natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), urban gas, butane, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (Amounts of the gases are summed after appropriate energy conversions, and the total is expressed in terms of the amount of urban gas.)
*10  This includes the amount of water used in a cyclic manner.
(For the above, data from the input-output table and other sources are used to obtain CO
2 emissions per unit of output.)The Fujifilm Group is working towards recognizing the social and environmental impact from our corporate activities in all business 
processes—from material procurement, manufacturing, and transportation, through to usage and final disposal. 
Understanding the entire picture of such impact caused by our activities throughout the value chain is helping us to accelerate 
our efforts towards realizing a sustainable society.

EnvironmentFujifilm Group Green Policy (Environmental Policy)
http://www.fujifilmholdings.com/en/sustainability/vision/greenpolicy /
Formulating internal guideline for calculations of 
greenhouse gas emissions based on the Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas Protocol
Requests from our investors and customers concerning disclosure 
of greenhouse gas emissions calculations based on the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Greenhouse Gas Protocol* have been in -
creasing. To respond to such requests, Fujifilm has formulated in -
ternal guideline that embody the procedure for greenhouse gas emissions calculations following the Basic Guideline on Supply Chain GHG Emission Accounting published in March 2012 by the Ministry of the Environment and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Since fiscal 2007, the FUJIFILM Group has been calculat -
ing the CO
2 emissions not only from its production processes, but 
also across the entire product lifecycle—including material pro -
curement, production, distribution, usage, and disposal. The cal -
culation results covering seven categories in whole 15 categories have already been evaluated and disclosed. We have re-estimated based on the Basic Guideline and verified that the calculations are feasible in 13 categories (including business travel and commut -
ing) using only data that we have already summerized. The catego -
ries of “Investments” and “Franchises” are not applicable to our business. Further, the five categories other than “Capital goods” were found to be minor contributors to CO
2 emissions, and the 
calculated CO 2 emissions results based on the Scope 3 were al -
most the same as the results based on our calculation method for product lifecycle.
We will fully utilize the new guideline and disclose the results 
properly.
* Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Greenhouse Gas Protocol : Scope 3 refers 
to indirect emissions, such as material procurement, distribution, usage, dispos -
al, as well as employees’ commuting and business travel. Scope 1 concerns di -
rect emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company, and Scope 2 
refers to indirect emissions resulting from energy usage.◉Understanding Our Overall Impact on Society32◉FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation Sustainability Report 2013CSR Activity Report

Risk Management Activities
The Fujifilm Group interprets compliance as “more than simply not breaking the law and acting 
correctly in the light of common sense and ethics.” We believe that we achieve compliance by re -
sponding flexibly with a keen sensibility to the needs of society.
A lack of awareness of compliance often leads to increased risk. Consequently, compliance 
and risk represent two sides of the same coin. A dedicated department in each operating company of the Fujifilm Group manages risks in a comprehensive and integrated manner, recognizing that promoting compliance and managing the risks associated with business operations is a single continuum. We steadfastly advance compliance and risk-management activities across the Group, with our two operating companies, Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox, overseeing their respective affiliates in Japan and overseas.
Fujifilm Group Compliance Statement     http://www.fujifilmholdings.com/en/about/philosophy/law /Charter for Corporate Behavior 
and Code of Conduct●●● Basic Approach
The Fujifilm Group’s compliance
As a set of fundamental policies, we have formulated the Fujifilm 
Group Charter for Corporate Behavior. We have also established the Fujifilm Group Code of Conduct to better guide each employ-ee to act and behave in compliance with laws, regulations and social ethics and make it clear that we give the first priority to compliance in our business activities. We have established a divi -
sion that is exclusively responsible for promoting compliance and instilling a compliance based mindset throughout the Group within each of our principal operating companies: FUJIFILM Corporation and Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. 
We also maintain offices to provide consultations and sup -
port communications regarding infringement issues related to the Code of Conduct and compliance both within and outside the operating companies. This effort is meant to facilitate the early detection of illegal or improper behavior and ensure prompt and appropriate response measures. All the communications and in -
formation are kept confidential and reported to the CSR Committee chaired by the president of FUJIFILM Holdings.• FujifilmIn April 2004, Fujifilm established its Compliance and Risk Management Division (CP&RM) as a dedicated organization for the promotion of compliance and risk management and the com -
prehensive and integrated management and operation of internal control. 
In recent years, we have been enhancing education on 
compliance, which we provide not only to affiliates in Japan but also to management at overseas affiliates. These efforts aim to promote awareness about compliance among all our employees, and we have been able to confirm their effect in increasing awareness from surveys conducted on employees. In addition, in response to the recent global movement to enhance law enforcement, as a Group we have introduced measures to inform our employees again about anti-corruption principles, and in April 2012 anti-corruption programs were introduced into Fujifilm and some of its affiliates. In the future, these rules will be applied to other affiliate companies too. • Fuji XeroxAt Fuji Xerox, we have laid down our Action Guidelines relating to ethics and compliance, and we are working to enhance the sys -
tem and its mechanisms in order to embed it in the actions of each and every executive officer and employee. Since fiscal 2008, 
● Compliance and Risk Management Promotional

● Corporate Ethics and Compliance Promotion System  
(Fuji Xerox and its affiliates)● System of Collect Information on Risk and Compliance 
Consulting (Fujifilm)
●Risk Management System (Fuji Xerox)
●Risk Map for Managing Risk (Fuji Xerox)we have been conducting general legal training using learning 
tools developed jointly with FUJIFILM Holdings and Fujifilm, and holding “Legal Risk Assessment Test.” We have been continuing our fraud prevention education (which presents examples of fraud and a checklist for preventing fraud) since fiscal 2010 to prevent the occurrence of misconduct. In addition, in fiscal 2011 we intro -
duced an education program which aims to prevent the occur -
rence of harassment. In fiscal 2012, due to the increase in the number of people being sent on business trips or posted over -
seas, we created a “Local legal guide for persons posted over -
seas (China & Singapore edition),” to assist employees in avoiding infringements of local laws in either their work or private capaci -
ties, and we conducted an educational program based on this.
The Fujifilm Group’s risk management
Each operating company establishes and maintains its own ap -
propriate risk management systems. Following prescribed proce -
dures, the operating companies report their risk management activities, including preventive measures and countermeasures against materialized risks to the CSR Committee secretariat. With regard to significant risks in Group operations, the CSR Committee takes a group-wide perspective in examining appropriate coun -
termeasures and effecting their implementation. As a holding company, FUJIFILM Holdings supervises business execution by subsidiaries from the standpoint of its shareholders, while also conducting operations common to the Group in a unified, efficient and appropriate manner.• FujifilmFujifilm has been implementing countermeasures against company-wide risks, which we identified based on the risks faced by each division and set as common issues. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, in response to the Great East Japan Earthquake and the disaster scenarios envisioned in the event of an eruption of Mount Fuji, an earthquake occurring directly under the Tokyo Metropolitan Area or a massive interrelated earthquake (Tokai, Tonankai and Nankai earthquakes along the Nankai trough), the company reviewed its company-wide risks to supplement and strengthen its countermeasures. Moreover, from fiscal 2013, we are specifically strengthening in efforts to exclude anti-social forces.• Fuji XeroxFuji Xerox places priority on actively managing risk, not just in emergencies, but also in its daily business operations, based on its ALL-FX Risk Management Rules. We manage potential risks based on their probabilities and anticipated impact on manage -
ment, set out staff responsibilities and define and implement measures to deal with such risks. In fiscal 2012, the company continued its involvement in activities for the recovery of the areas afflicted by the Great East Japan Earthquake, as well as imple -
menting disaster prevention countermeasures based on the les -
sons of that disaster. We also specified the major risks which the company should prioritize in its efforts, and held deliberations re -
garding the current way we respond to them in the CSR Committee. In fiscal 2013, we intend to enhance our efforts to ensure that the lessons and experience of the Great East Japan Earthquake are not lost over time, and the CSR Committee will continue to conduct periodic reviews of these efforts.

FeaturePromoting Anti-Global Warming Measures
The Fujifilm Group announced its long-term goal of “reducing CO 2 
emissions for the entire life cycle of the products by 30% by fiscal 
2020 (relative to fiscal 2005)” in April 2010. In addition to corporate activities in areas directly linked to CO
2 reduction, activities have 
been expanded across the entire life cycles of products and services (“procurement” of materials and “manufacturing,” “transportation,” “use,” and “disposal”), executed in a wide range of fields in order to cut CO
2 emissions by 1,524,000 tons/year in absolute terms over 
CO 2 emissions for the standard fiscal 2005 year level of 5,049,000 
tons/year, achieving 3,525,000 tons/year in fiscal 2020.
We continued to face a severe economic situation also in fiscal 
2012, however, the Group’s production output increased relative to the base year (fiscal 2005). The entire Group’s CO
2 emissions 
were reduced by 298,000 tons (6%) from the base year level. While CO
2 emission coefficients* for Japanese electric power utili -
ties increased by 12% or more relative to fiscal 2005, we reduced CO
2 emissions by 149,000 tons (10%) in the manufacturing stage 
and by 496,000 tons (45%) in the use stage by developing multi -
function devices with less energy consumption. In the procure -
ment stage, our CO 2 emissions continued to show an upward 
trend, but we achieved a substantial reduction of 346,000 tons (14%) relative to fiscal 2011 thanks to the expanded use of the closed-loop recycling system for CTP/PS plates (plate materials for printing). In fiscal 2013, we will continue to introduce energy-saving production technologies and improve the system opera -
tion, to further reduce CO
2 emissions from energy use.
* C O 2 emission coefficients: In Japan, we referred to the CO 2 emission co -
efficients for electric power utilities shown on the Japanese Ministry of the 
Environment’s website for the greenhouse gas emission calculation and reporting scheme every year. For overseas, we referred to CO
2 Emissions 
from Fuel Combustion 2012 (IEA).In 2007, the Fujifilm Group launched the Global Warming 
Prevention Committee for its six major factories in Japan, which emitted large amounts of CO
2 from production activities, with a 
view to decreasing their per-unit energy use by 30% and per-unit CO
2 emissions by 40% relative to fiscal 1990. In addition to these 
activities, the Group has also been implementing the Energy Cost Total

[Target]
reduction
(relative to 2005)30%Reduction Project since fiscal 2010, the goal of the project is to 
halve the growth in energy costs for the entire Group, including overseas operations, in anticipation of an expansion in manufac -
turing and a sharp rise in fuel costs and electricity charges. By upholding cost cutting as an organization-wide goal, the project aims at making progress more visible and at accelerating reduc -
tions in energy consumption and CO
2 emissions.
By the activities of the project, we have been proactive in 
implementing energy conservation measures for production proc -
esses, including the introduction of new energy conservation technologies to our large-scale flat panel materials production line, the startup of wind power generation at the Netherlands plant, and improvements to the temperature/humidity control sys -
tem for the production process clean room. In addition, in fiscal 2012 we continued to implement and enhance the measures launched in and before fiscal 2011, such as the consolidation of offices, replacement of office lighting equipment with task lights and others, and the reduction of the air-conditioning load in rooms.
Furthermore, we also focused on reducing the use of energy 
that is not directly linked with production output (fixed amount of energy used regardless of the production and standby energy consumed during non-production), and as a result of fostering energy conservation and cost reduction across the board, we were able to achieve the targets of the Global Warming Prevention Committee and the Energy Cost Reduction Project. The cuts brought about by the project are equivalent to about 17% of the entire Group’s annual energy costs.
In and after fiscal 2013, we will continue with both energy 
conservation and energy cost reductions under the new promo -
tion framework by setting new targets for the future.12,000 tons in terms of CO
2 emissions. Also at our offices, we 
fostered the use of task ambient lighting and drastically controlled the use of air conditioners after office hours.
In recognition of the power-saving activities conducted in the 
summer of 2011 and their achievements, we were awarded a prize by the Director-General of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy at the Energy Conservation Awards in 2012 and also re -
ceived the Minister of the Environment’s prize at the watt sense award 2012, being highly evaluated for the measures implement -
ed at our offices.
* C O 2 conversion: All sites in Japan that adopted the 201 1 emission coef -
ficient announced by the Federation of Electric Power Companies of 
Japan (0.476 t-CO 2/MWh) continued their activities to reduce their use of 
electricity.
Fujifilm’s Kanagawa Factory uses chilled water produced by a re -
frigerator system to ensure stable operation of its air conditioners 
and production processes. For the stable operation of manufac -
turing equipment, it is necessary to maintain the temperature of the chilled water at a certain level, and for this purpose the refrig -
erator was in constant operation and used a large amount of elec -
tricity. To reduce the energy use, the factory installed a thermal storage tank between the refrigerator and the manufacturing equipment to shorten the refrigerator’s operating hours. The ther -
mal storage tank is designed to prevent the mixing of warm water returned from the equipment with the chilled water produced by the refrigerator, and while the chilled water in the tank is being used, the operation of the refrigerator can be suspended. With the introduction of this tank, the factory reduced its energy use by about 400 MWh per year, which is equivalent to about 200 tons in terms of reduced CO
2 emissions. We will introduce this thermal 
storage tank for other equipment and factories from fiscal 2013. In addition, we are implementing anti-noise measures, adopting a new refrigerant that does not deplete the ozone layer, and reusing water to save on resource to make our facilities even more envi -
ronmentally friendly.
In fiscal 2012, as in the previous fiscal year, we were requested by some of the electric power companies in Japan to reduce our power use during peak hours by 10%, 7% or 5% due to the tight supply of electricity in summer. In response, Fujifilm and its Group companies in Japan conducted company-wide power-saving ac -
tivities. At 25 bases that use a large amount of electricity (contract amount: 500 kW or more) across Japan, we built up a system to calculate and manage the use of electricity in real time via our in -
tranet to reduce the peak use of electricity by 15% or more, and as a result achieved an 18% reduction. Specifically, we reduced power use by 24,000 MWh in total, which is equivalent to about The tank is cooled

Fujifilm participated as a member of the working group in 
formulating the Japan Chemical Industry Association (JCIA)’s “Guideline for Calculating Reductions in CO
2 Emissions”. *2
We plan to continue our efforts to spread this approach of 
environmentally conscious products and services, not only within our company, but throughout society as a whole.Since 2003, in Fujifilm we have been designing new products and upgrading products by following our “Rule for Design for Environment (DfE)” in our efforts to reduce the environmental im -
pact of our products. In fiscal 2012, we formulated the internal guideline which brought together our approach and methodology for making the reduction in CO
2 emissions throughout the entire 
product life cycle, quantitative and “visible” as our environmental contribution. Our reduction approach in environmental impact re -
sults in not only our manufacturing process in Fujifilm, but also the customer’s use of the product. This guideline was utilized in order to make our social contribution in terms of measures which con -
sider the environment more readily understandable and easily communicated. 
In order to cover all various products in Fujifilm, this guideline 
consists of four categories with three categories for contribution to reduction in the environmental impact based on function of products, 1) chemical products, components and materials; 2) equipments (using energy when used); 3) IT systems, and another category: 4) Energy-generating products (solar battery). The methodology in all categories refer the guidelines *
1 in  ea ch  r e -
spective industries. We have also issued an appendix which gives concrete examples of trial calculations for each category, as In the Fujifilm Group, we carry out development of environmentally conscious products based on “Rule for 
Design for Environment (DfE)”, in the design stage, we set targets from the perspective of safety & compli -
ance, the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle), chemical substances contained, energy saving, conservation of biodiversity, etc., considering the entire product life cycle from procurement through manufacture, transpor-tation, use by customer, to disposal and we review the degree of achievement of these targets after develop -
ment. Our approach is not limited to materials or  equipment, but extends to software and solution by our products and services too, and we make efforts to contribute to reducing the environmental burden across the whole of society. Furthermore, we conduct quantitative and objective assessment of environmental im -
pact based on LCA*, and we are utilizing environmental labels to actively disseminate information related to the environment.

Industrial Science and Technology Policy and Environment Bureau Director-General’s Award in the 9th Life Cycle Assessment Society of Japan AwardsFUJIFILM Speciality Ink Systems Limited (United Kingdom) intro -
duced highly productive, leading-edge digital ink manufacturing 
equipment to increase its UV ink production output by more than 50%, following completion of a new digital ink manufacturing plant in January 2013. Digital printing helps minimize the use of imaging materials, such as chemicals and water by controlling the placement of ink on printing media using digital images and com -
puter software. With digital printing, the use of ink can be reduced by more than 50% compared with conventional printing, which leads to a substantial reduction in the amount of ink and printing media wasted.
The company installed equipment that adopts new technology 
to reduce environmental impact and create substantial environ-mental improvements. Thermal energy wasted from the manufac-turing process can now be used together with compressed air generated from a new heat exchange system, to provide 70% of the heat required for the entire factory. A new boiler plant has also been installed, which incorporates highly efficient modulation compres-sion condensing boilers, reducing the use of fossil fuels by 40% of the amount required for a conventional heating system.
The installation of this new digital ink manufacturing equip -
ment, demonstrate the company’s strong commitment to high-quality manufacturing and contribution to the environment and sustainability. In recognition of its highly reputable approach as an industry leader in the environmental field, the company was short -
listed for the Sustainable Innovation Award 2012 held by BCF*.

Rising Demands  
on the Business World
I am very impressed by the Fujifilm Group’s manage-
ment stance of repeatedly producing results to make steady and reliable progress toward the targets for 2020 which were decided upon in 2010. Energy conservation efforts have been added to various ideas and innova-tive technologies as an expert manufacturer, to achieve significant results in the reduction of CO
2 emissions 
and costs. This excellence has been recognized by the award of various sorts of prizes. 
As a matter of fact, the atmospheric CO
2 concentra-
tion has now exceeded the 400 ppm mark, inciting fur -
ther demands to reduce CO 2 emissions amid concerns 
that the average temperature rise will exceed 2℃. In addition, demands are now being made of the business world to offer solutions for a wide range of issues, such as biodiversity, the depletion of water and other re-sources, poverty and epidemics and human rights, etc.  If a healthy earth is also essential for healthy business, businesses should address these issues for the sake of both protecting the earth and protecting themselves. 
If the Fujifilm Group goes on to respond to these 
sorts of social demands and expectations using all its collective strengths, this would be greatly welcomed by global society. And at the same time, it would help to further assure the future prosperity of the Fujifilm Group.
Response to the third-party opinion
As a manufacturer, 90% of our CO 2 emissions derive from 
energy sources. While continuously introducing energy 
conservation technologies in our plants and production processes, we have set targets for CO
2 reductions across 
the whole lifecycle of our products, as well as at our for -
eign subsidiaries worldwide, to broaden the scope of our energy conservation activities. In addition, we have al -
ready begun to make preparations for activities looking to preserve biodiversity and the depletion of water and other resources, but we take on board Mr. Sueyoshi’s insightful comments regarding expanding our perspective to the global environment and how we should engage in activi -
ties to solve these issues as an actor which as a business needs to “protect the earth to protect itself,” as is now ex -
pected of us as a leading company. We shall go on to act in a unified manner to promote these activities, in order for the Fujifilm Group to win through and “assure its future prosperity.”(CSR Group, General Affairs Division, FUJIFILM Holdings)Mr. Takejiro Sueyoshi

Debate on future environmental measures 
demanded of the printing industry 
On July 23, 2012, we invited experts to the Development Center at 
the Yoshida-Minami Factory to conduct a dialogue with our re -
searchers on the theme of “Changes in the Printing Industry from an Environmental Perspective and Our Future Measures,” with the aim of stimulating environmental measures by raising environmen -
tal awareness and offering an opportunity to find out about trends in the market’s environmental demands. Professor Norihiro Itsubo from Tokyo City University gave a lecture, and after hearing the views of our actual customers, we held a panel discussion to de -
bate the future direction of the printing industry and how the Fujifilm Group should respond. 
Through this dialogue, we obtained advice on how to reduce 
the environmental burdens by calculating the carbon footprint and on product design which use an index other than CO
2 emis -
sions as well, and the need to inform these efforts and products. In the future, we aim to combine high customer satisfaction levels with an environmental response, and make full use of the views ① The facilitator was Professor 
Norihiro Itsubo from Tokyo City 
University, who is renowned for his LCA research. 
② We conducted a 
panel discussion with Mr. Hiroshi Hasegawa from Dai Nippon Printing Co. Ltd. representing our customers’ views. 
③ Around 40 researchers from 
the Development Center at the Yoshida-Minami Factory participated on the day. Fuji Xerox digital color multifunction devices have been awarded 
the Grand Prize for Energy Saving Product (Eco-Products Category) at the Ninth Eco-Products Awards, organized by the Eco-Products Awards Steering Committee. In fiscal 2012, they also won the Chairman’s Prize, The Energy Conservation Center, Japan, presented by the Energy Conservation Center, Japan (ECCJ) in the 2012 Grand Prize for Excellence in Energy Efficiency and Conservation (Product Category & Business Model Category).
Under the concept RealGreen, Fuji Xerox develops products 
that realize energy conservation while also achieving comfortable and convenient product usage. The digital color multifunction devices that received the prizes* were developed to tackle the issue of sleep mode not being used by customers. Sleep mode, when used, could significantly save energy consumption but it was not being used because recovering from the sleep mode requires customers to wait. By integrating three of Fuji Xerox’s unique energy-saving technologies, these products have realized virtually zero waiting experience for the recovery from the sleep mode. Now customers no longer have to wait, even when using the sleep mode, enabling stress-free use of our multifunction devices.
Fuji Xerox is industry’s first in receiving the Grand Prize for 
Excellence in Energy Efficiency and Conservation 12 times since it first received it in 1999. Fuji Xerox will continue to develop energy-saving products in an aim to reduce the environmental impact on the whole society.

Aggressive 
Environment management Based on Product Life Cycle 
Last year, FUJIFILM Holdings established an epoch-
making eco-innovation by developing a recycling system for reuse of used aluminum PS plates into new PS plates, capable of achieving the required high qual-ity of more than 99.5% purity. This system, which had at first seemed impossible, was realized as a result of FUJIFILM Holdings continuously and diligently con-ducting measures for environment management focused on the product life cycle. I evaluate this very highly. 
Product life cycle assessment is already used in a 
wide-range of products from automobiles and electric and electronic equipment to food. However, it is usu-ally used in products directed at consumers (B to C), and has certainly not yet been sufficiently analyzed with regards to services or products for company (B to B). In addition to the fine example of PS plates (B to B), Fujifilm Holdings is also making significant contributions to the reduction of environmental burden by taking active measures regarding cosmetics, which, although directed at consumers (B to C), until now has been behind other fields in the development of products for the environment, as well as regarding services such as medical devices and solutions. Fujifilm Holdings has not only been active in introducing assessment of tar -
gets which have seldom been conducted in an interdis -
ciplinary way before, but while enhancing the functions of its products, it has also been deploying eco-innova-tions which significantly contribute to the reduction of environmental impact in a wide variety of fields. I hope to see Fujifilm Holdings continue in its “aggressive” environment management by coolly putting it into prac-tice from the perspective of life cycle.
Response to the third-party opinion
Your high evaluation of our efforts which consider the 
environment across the entire product life cycle that we have been continuously implementing since approxi -
mately 10 years ago, as well as of our contribution to the reduction of environmental impact by medical devices, solutions services and cosmetics, will spur us on in our future endeavors. 
In the future, we intend to continue to use our internal 
rule of “design for environment” which takes into account the product development process, to actively promote “aggressive” environment management based on product life cycle, to provide environmentally conscious products and services in Fujifilm Group.

The Fujifilm Group is well aware of the importance of finite resources. We have 
been gathering and reusing silver, which is used in manufacturing photosensi -
tive materials that had been our main product since the start of our business. Today we actively continue with our efforts to reduce the amount of virgin re -
sources, which include establishing a resource recycling system for multifunc -
tion devices and copiers. We are conducting efforts to use resources effectively and reduce waste through measures which take into account the total lifecycle of a product, by considering the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) in the product design, reducing loss at the manufacturing stage, collecting, reusing and recy -
cling used products, and recycling or converting into valuables of wastes.
Fuji Xerox Eco-Manufacturing (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 
a recycling base in Suzhou China
• Measures to reduce wastes
The Fujifilm Group is making comprehensive efforts to use re -
sources effectively and reduce wastes throughout the entire life -
cycle of its products, from design to manufacturing and dispos -
ing. We think carefully about the most effective ways to use resources and reduce wastes as much as possible, by consider -
ing reduction of resources in products and recycling after use in the design stage, and reducing losses at the manufacturing stage. Meanwhile, we are concerned about wastes emitted necessarily in manufacturing too, and since fiscal 2011 we have been involved in project as Fujifilm Group to convert wastes in manufacturing into valuables and raise the value of these valuables. 
In this project, the entire Fujifilm Group, including Fujifilm, Fuji 
Xerox, FUJIFILM Holdings and other affiliates, came together to target the three main wastes at our manufacturing sites: waste plastics, oil waste and sludge. The Fujifilm Group gathered to -
gether wastes, the disposal of which had previously been out -
sourced by each manufacturing site (by treatment as wastes or by incineration so that only heat recovery was possible for the small amount of the emission), and reselected subcontracting compa -
nies carefully. That has led to achieve high-grade recycling (mate -
rial recycling) and conversion of wastes into valuables, making the Fujifilm Group’s use of resources more effective. 
More concretely, we divided oil waste according to whether 
or not it could be recycled by distilling and reselected subcontrac -
tors—a distillation recycler if waste could be distilled or an incineration company for heat recovery if waste could not be distilled—to maximize the effective use of resources. In addition, we increased the volume of wastes converted into valuables and raised the value of these valuables by deploying the waste plas -
tics recycling company that Fuji Xerox had been using to recycle used copiers across the entire Fujifilm Group. As a result of these activities, by the end of fiscal 2012 we were able to achieve a re -
duction of 20% in our outsourced waste disposal costs compared with fiscal 2010. In the future, we intend to expand these meas -
ures to use resources effectively, to wastes in office, sales and warehouse too.
• Measures to achieve zero landfill from products
At Fuji Xerox, based on the approach that “used products are not 
waste products but valuable resources,” we have been introduc -
ing resource recycling activities aiming for Infinite Zero Landfill through the maximum use of resources by collecting used prod -
ucts and reusing *
1 and recycling *2 them. 
In the Japanese market, we have accomplished Zero Landfill 
of collected used products by reusing their components. We are now broadening resource recycling sites overseas modeled on this achievement. We established recycling bases in the Asia Pacific region (Thailand) in fiscal 2004. A further base was built in Taiwan in fiscal 2007, and in Suzhou, China, in fiscal 2008 and we have established a recycling system. In fiscal 2012, we launched the operation of recycle systems in Korea, Australia and New Zealand, regions that had previously been handled by the Thai site. We intend to proceed in the future with our recycling systems 
●Fuji Xerox’s Measures to Achieve Zero LandfillWe are conducting continuous efforts to reduce waste products in our factories, by placing the highest priority on not causing them at all (reducing), and making efforts to reduce loss in processing, reduce the number of times the processing line stops and reducing the rate of occurrence of faulty products toward the reduction of loss in manufacturing. At FUJIFILM SHIZUOKA, in the process for manufacturing a coating liquid for PET film, we developed a “New Liquid Preparation System” (see figure below) which makes the liquid preparation equipment more compact, has a mechanism whereby special air pushes out residual liquid left in pipes, and introduces a mechanism to return the sample used for measurement of the physical properties of the liquid after measurement without throwing it away. Just by eliminating this reduction in loss of residual liquid from pipes and measurement, we have achieved a reduction in loss of 270 tons per year.
Regarding loss of materials or products that unfortunately 
does occur, we are promoting higher levels of quality in recycling. Leftover materials such as those from inkjet paper, which we had been thermal recycling as fuel, is now being separated into paper and laminate plastic and we have established a method to return each of these to their raw materials and are converting this waste into valuables. Through the support of our head office, the FUJIFILM SHIZUOKA, which had been outsourcing the disposal of oil waste to a processing company, has now been able to com -
bine with other sites to outsource together, achieving conversion into valuables due to the merit of scale. As a result of these activi -
ties, in fiscal 2012, we were able to achieve a 10% reduction on the amount of waste materials generated in 2003. across the region, and launch products that include reused com -
ponents, as in Japan.

Enhancing our global regime for resource recycling to maintain zero landfill, no pollution and  no illegal dumping
Nowadays, there is concern, evident in trends such as the Ban 
Amendment to the Basel Convention* and individual countries’ regulations regarding the export of hazardous waste, regarding the problem of the passage of waste across borders from Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to non-OECD countries. Taking into account this trend in international society, at Fuji Xerox, we have launched the opera -
tion of recycle systems in Korea, Australia and New Zealand, to recycle used products from their own countries domestically, rather than transporting them to our recycling center in Thailand, as previously. This was launched as a trial from fiscal 2011, and officially went into operation from Jan. 2012, achieving zero land -
fill, no pollution and no illegal dumping in these countries by June of the same year.
Moreover, the responsibility for the recycle system in each of 
these countries lies with our sales company in each country, and they operate a mechanism of 1) collecting used cartridges; 2) conducting processes from disassembling and separating (either within their company or outsourcing) to recycling; and 3) conduct -
ing management of this series of processes.
* Basel Convention: The official title is “Basel Convention on the Control of 
Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal.” In the Ban Amendment to the Basel Convention, the export of hazardous waste from OECD countries to developing nations (non-OECD members) is, in principle, completely prohibited. ● An Example of Reduction of Loss in Manufacturing: Reduction

FeatureBiodiversity Conservation
The Fujifilm Group has engaged in a wide range of environmental protection 
activities for the conservation and protection of biodiversity, based upon its philosophy of “environmental consciousness and environmental protection are at the core of our corporate activities.” In June 2009, we clarified our guideline for cross-group efforts to biodiversity conservation and introduced the “Fujifilm Group Basic Concepts and Action Guidelines for the Biodiversity Conservation” (hereafter, “Guidelines for Biodiversity”). Activities both inside and outside the company are being advanced to preserve the ecosystem services that benefit mankind for the future.

factory
◎  Co-sponsoring training courses for Nature 
Conservation Educators 
Since fiscal 2001, Fuji Xerox has been holding training 
courses jointly with the Nature Conservation Society of Japan, which have been attended by more than 300 employees in total. 
◎  Support to the Monitoring Site 1000
We have been providing high sensitivity negative film for sensor cameras used in surveying mammals since 2007.
◎  Land-use surveys at manufacturing sites aiming at 
conserving biodiversity
Fuji Xerox has been conducting these land-use surveys since April 2010.
◎  Rice Paddy Assistance Team 
Regional collaboration activities to preserve groundwater in Minami-Aso village. FUJIFILM Kyusyu has been participating in these activities since fiscal 2010.
◎  Support to projects by NPOs and NGOs involved in 
education on biodiversity conservation for the next generation Main activities for biodiversity conservationSince the Fujifilm Group uses many natural resources in its prod -
ucts and services, we consider biodiversity conservation to be an 
issue of importance on a global scale, alongside climate change. Since 2005, we have begun efforts to share perspectives and awareness on this issue and close the gaps between our and oth -
ers’ level of awareness, by conducting stakeholder dialogue with experts and raising awareness among employees, etc. In 2009, we formulated the Group’s “Guidelines for Biodiversity” and launched more concrete measures. From 2010, Fujifilm began op-eration of measures for biodiversity conservation within its “Rule for Design for Environment (DfE).” At Fuji Xerox, since 2010, we have been conducting surveys on land use for the purpose of bio -
diversity conservation at production and product development sites in both Japan and overseas to spread these activities.
In fiscal 2012, aiming to take activities to the next level, we 
systemized the activities and set medium-term targets. We based our approach in systemizing these activities on the premise not only that we should secure resources sustainably with a minimum impact on biodiversity (as included in the “Guidelines for Biodiversity”), but also that the maintenance and recovery of bio -
diversity is also another aspect of corporate social responsibility. As a result, we organized our approach based on the four key ele -
ments of “factories” and “products,” as major elements which impact upon biodiversity for us as a manufacturer, and “social contribution” and “communication,” as our corporate social re -
sponsibility (see the right figure). From among all the activities conducted for each key element, we incorporated those which we should continue to be aware of as priority issues, we intend to promote measures for the conservation of biodiversity combining business with environmental protection through conducting activities.  
As paper is vital material for Fuji Xerox’s business operations, 
we have been aiming for sustainable and responsible paper pro -
curement. In fiscal 2004, Fuji Xerox established Environmental, Health and Safety requirements regarding paper procurement for companies that supply the paper which we use or sell. Amidst growing public interest in biodiversity conservation, Fuji Xerox ex -
panded the scope of the regulations and started the operation in June 2012. 
The previous regulations only included standards for the 
procured paper, but Fuji Xerox took a step further to add trading

He is involved in efforts to construct partner-ships, etc., between companies, governments and international institutions, aiming for the creation of a sustainable society through biodiversity conservation. He also acts as an environment management advisor for numerous leading companies within Japan.Third-Party Opinion on “Biodiversity Conservation” OPINION
Our hope is that FUJIFILM Holdings switches 
to a new business model that promote and accelerate environmental and biodiversity conservation. 
Biodiversity is no longer simply just an issue about liv-
ing creatures, but is now considered an important constituent element of the natural resources which support both society 
and the economy. We hope that the Fujifilm Group continues with the efforts for biodiversity conservation that you have been making in each field until now. But it is also our hope that in the future, not least for the sake of the long-term continua-tion of your business, you are able to switch to a new business model that promote and accelerate environmental and biodi-versity conservation.” This is an essentially different approach to promoting CSR through your main business activities, since it means putting into practice your corporate philosophy of “remaining a leading company which creates new values” in the field of the environment, expanded to include biodiversity. Since its foundation, your company has been putting efforts into the conservation of water, as the most critical “ecosystem service.” But we hope that you will go on to conduct CSR activities as a leading company which has transformed its busi-ness model into something more like “the more our business activities grow, the more the water environment prospers.” 
Response to the third-party opinion
The Fujifilm Group appreciates your warm evaluation of our 
efforts for biodiversity conservation, which we have promoted 
from various perspectives based on our basic approach that environmental consciousness and environmental protection are at the core of our corporate activities. We also thank you for your good advice concerning how we should address the issue of biodiversity as a company. We intend to make further efforts to advance through our pioneering original technologies based on our vision, including the perspective of the transfor -
mation of our business model into one appropriate for a lead -
ing company whose approach to CSR is that its main business activities themselves promote environmental conservation.(CSR Group, General Affairs Division, FUJIFILM Holdings)

Improving Chemical Substance Management
• Fujifilm
Fujifilm established its rules on the management of chemical sub -
stances in 1995, and has set down the classification criteria of 
each chemical substance based on laws and regulations, haz -
ards and management policy, and set down the method of han -
dling according to each classification. In addition, TOYAMA CHEMICAL and Fuji Xerox in the Fujifilm Group also share these classification criteria, and we are promoting consistency in our management of chemical substances. All the chemical substanc -
es used in manufacturing processes are registered in a database and the status of their use is monitored. We continue to manage chemical substances properly based on the latest information such as newly registering or updating information on several hun -
dreds of data in fiscal 2012.
We are using the information communication framework pro -
posed by the Joint Article Management Promotion-consortium (JAMP) *
1 for the management of information on chemical sub -
stances contained in products. In fiscal 2012, toward the • Fuji Xerox
At Fuji Xerox, we are putting efforts into conducting consistent management of chemical substances throughout Fuji Xerox and its affiliates, both within Japan and overseas, based upon the safety classification across the entire Fujifilm Group, as well as conduct -
ing management of the chemical substances contained in prod -
ucts and enhancing our response to regulations on chemical sub -
stances, which are increasing worldwide. 
In fiscal 2012, we reviewed our method of auditing the man -
agement of chemical substances contained in articles at our sup -
pliers. We have enhanced the items included among the previous document screening items which confirm implementation of the framework, and we have also begun to actively conduct auditing in the workplace. 
In addition, in accordance with the expansion of production 
and sales in China, we are proceeding with the establishment of information collection bases to more speedily and reliably re -
spond to laws and regulations. We have established a system to comprehensively collect information by establishing information routes from the government and local industrial associations. Regarding notifications on new chemical substances, we have established a system which can be implemented by our local sub -
sidiaries in China which has both speeded up process for the notifications and reduced the costs for them. In the future we in -
tend to continue to strengthen our system for effective and reliable response to laws and regulations. promotion of usage of the information management system that we introduced in 2010, as well as conducting brief-ings to suppliers, we also made efforts with suppliers for solving issues on communicating information on chemical substances. As a result, we were able to greatly improve the rate of usage of the information management system. We have been participating in JAMP since its foundation, and we are also involved in its activi -
ties to build the framework to communicate information on chemi -
cal substances and to disseminate the framework  internationally. In fiscal 2012, we conducted presentations to explain case exam -
ples of the framework proposed by JAMP at conferences held in China and Korea and conducted efforts to promote understand -
ing on the framework.
Regarding the safety data sheet used as a means to com -
municate safety information on chemical products to our custom -
ers, we are communicating not only information on chemical sub -
stances required by laws and regulations in place, but information on a broad range of chemical substances to our customers, and we have been continuously disclosing such information on our website. Furthermore, we are also participating in JIPS *
2, a volun-
tary activity to disclose safety information on chemical products broadly to society as a whole, and we released the safety sum -
maries on mixtures (chemicals made up of two or more different substances).

industry organization established in 2006 for the purpose of smooth communication and management of information on chemical substances contained in products throughout the supply chain.
*2  Japan Initiative of Product Stewardship (JIPS): A voluntary activity conducted by companies to disclose information and conduct risk assessment of chemical products promoted by the Japan Chemical Industry Association (JCIA), for the purpose of sound chemical management throughout the entire supply chain.Based on the increasing safety requirements with regards to elec -
trical and electronic products, and the enhancement of worldwide 
regulations on chemical substances, the number of new or re -
vised environmental and safety regulations to be reviewed on the point of relation to the products has doubled in the past several years. In addition, approx. one-fifth of these legal documents are written in languages other than Japanese, English or Chinese, and along with the increase in laws and regulations, the handle of different languages is becoming an issue. A correct understand -

progress in new legislation occurring in emerging countries, we built a mechanism for discussions on response and information exchange regarding legislation relating to the environment and safety with our offices in the U.A.E., India and Brazil, etc., to en -
hance our system for compliance with laws and regulations. We continue to enhance our system for compliance with laws and regulations in response to the globalization of our business. Because the Fujifilm Group manufactures a wide range of products 
such as chemical products, functional materials, optical devices, of-fice equipment, and medical equipment, etc., we have established and implement management rules according to the respective composi -
tion and manufacturing processes of our products, from the perspec-tive of management of the handling of chemical substances and man-agement of information on chemical substances. 
Since 2010, in our Medium-Term CSR Plan, we have been making 
efforts for the priority issues of establishing and disseminating the framework to acquire, manage ,and communicate information on chemical substances contained in products along the supply chain and enhancing our system to acquire information on laws and regula-tions in each country and region around the world accurately, and to ensure response efficiently.

Hopes for the Fujifilm Group’s 
Chemical Substance Management as a Company involved in Manufacturing at the Upstream, Midstream and Downstream Stages
Any company involved in manufacturing needs to take 
measures for the management of chemical substances, but the content and key points for management vary depending on the type of relationship with chemical substances the company has. The Fujifilm Group is conducting chemical substance management according to the type of procured goods, manufacturing process and products as a company positioned in upstream, midstream and downstream. These measures provide a good example which is of reference to other companies conducting chemical substance management. 
It is of great significance that the Fujifilm Group 
is actively involved in building a common manage-ment framework and promoting its dissemination, as autonomous efforts in the industry, and I would like to see the continuation of these activities in the future. In particular, the communication of information is essential to the management of chemical substances throughout the entire supply chain, and if the burden of this can be reduced by improving the efficiency of communicating information, this will also lead to the promotion of sound management throughout the entire supply chain. 
While chemical substances are essential to daily 
life, it is somewhat difficult for a company to highlight the management of chemical substances which have an inherent level of hazardousness, but I would like to think that the mention of “improving” in the title was chosen to encapsulate the Fujifilm Group’s intention of going on to conduct even more sound management of such substances in the future. I hope to see even higher levels of chemical substance management from the Fujifilm Group in the future.
Response to the third-party opinion
In manufacturing, a wide variety of chemical substances 
are used in a diverse array of ways. The title here incorpo -
rates our intention to continuously improve our manage -
ment of chemical substances based upon the latest in -
formation. In order to conduct sound chemical substance management throughout the lifecycle of our products, we need the cooperation of our entire supply chain. We be-lieve that the framework of common management will not only reduce the burden on each individual company in the supply chain, but will also promote the accurate com -
munication of information and therefore we are actively promoting the use and dissemination of this framework. We keep exerting efforts for the management of chemical substances across the entire supply chain. (Ecology and Quality Management, CSR Division, FUJIFILM Corporation)Takao Sugaya

As part of our measures for human rights due diligence, in Sep. 
2012, we participated in the Human Rights Due Diligence Workshop* held by the Nippon CSR Consortium, and held dis -
cussions with many participants from relevant companies, NGOs and CSR experts regarding human rights issues. As a first step, we conducted dialogue with companies and NGOs, listened to the experiences of NGOs which are active in working to resolve numerous human rights issues, and exchanged opinions relating to human rights issues. As a second step, in accordance with the “UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights” as recognized by the United Nations Human Rights Council, and with reference to the Human Rights Guidance Tool formulated by the UNEP FI (United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative) in Nov. 2011, we laid out the human rights risks for our company and set down priority issues for each industry.
In this workshop, the Fujifilm Group participated in dis -
cussions related to our priority businesses of highly functional materials and the healthcare-related chemical and pharmaceuti -
cal industries, and as a result recognized that priority issues for us including “workplace condition,” both within our company and on our supply chain, and “resources” for local communities, etc. In the future, we plan to raise the discussion points from this work -

Fujifilm has launched a training program targeted at employees at 
subsidiaries outside Japan, for the purpose of promoting the “FUJIFILM WAY,” which explains the common Group corporate philosophy and corporate vision, and sums up the ways of work -

ing HR managers from 10 subsidiaries. It was also conducted in China in December 2012, targeting HR managers from eight sub -
sidiaries, and in March 2013, targeting management level employ -
ees, with the total participants numbering over 150. In fiscal 2013, we plan to start conducting it in Europe and for management level employees in North America and China. believe that by conducting planned and consistent human re -
source rotation, we can strengthen the corporate structure by enabling individual and corporate growth, through allowing em -
ployees to gain a broad and diverse perspective on our business from experiencing various types of work and working environments. 
From 2013 onward, we plan to actively promote the implemen-
tation of human resource development based on this new system.
Unlike the “Global Leadership Seminar” which aims for the devel -
opment of management employees who can participate in Group 
level management, the “FUJIFILM WAY” training is targeted at all employees. We are aiming to have top level employees from our overseas companies who have participated in this training go on to promote and disseminate its content among the local staff overseas. Furthermore, we hope that through developing a com -
mon understanding of the “FUJIFILM WAY,” our overseas employ -
ees will gain an awareness of “One company, One Fujifilm” in their activities, and that this will enhance our partnership as the em -
ployees of the Fujifilm Group in every company endeavor to work toward a common goal.
Fuji Xerox has reviewed its leader development training and, in 
fiscal 2008, launched training for the development of leaders who will be responsible for growth and change going toward the next 50 years. Furthermore, in fiscal 2012, we conducted this training with an expanded target to include even our affiliates and sales companies.
One aspect of this which is proceeding ahead of the rest is 
training targeted at middle-manager class employees, enabling them to take on a management perspective and demonstrate their leadership skills. This training program is being conducted jointly with not only our domestic but also our overseas affiliates, as training to develop change leader who will go on to be active in the global arena. In fiscal 2012, 21 people participated from Japan and 13 people participated from overseas (Asia & Oceania). The training was begun in July in Japan, and in October overseas, with a joint workshop being held in November. Then, in August 2014, the participants selected from each country will go on to face practical management issues, and propose and implement their solutions. Even those who already have proven results at the do -
mestic management level find that their perspective is instantane -
ously broadened by the experience of management on a global scale, and they say they experience a heightened sense of crisis and are sharply reminded of the importance of cooperation and collaboration with others.  
In the future, we intend to proceed to implement similar 
ALL-FX (Fuji Xerox and its affiliate and sales companies) training for other levels of employees. 
At Fuji Xerox (Japan), we now have diverse human resources from 
a total of 10 countries working for us, and of the newly recruited employees who entered the company in April 2013, 10% were of non-Japanese nationality. One of our efforts in seeking out hu -
man resources of outstanding talent from overseas is the “Visiting Fellowship program” which we have been operating since 1998. We accept about 10 student interns per year from China, which acts to deepen our business-academia relations with some of China’s most famous universities, while also contributing to us securing very talented engineering human resources. In the 14 years since the program was launched, it has had 122 partici -
pants, 25 of whom went on to become full-time employees (as of April 2012). From 2013, based upon the needs of the workplace and from the perspective of enhancing our competitiveness through diversity, we aim to primarily recruit outstandingly talented human

At Fujifilm, toward the achievement of the medium-term manage -

“What” and solved their tasks, and in the summer of 2012, we launched “G-up” activities to improve the strengths of the work -
place. For the purpose of one of the key points of “G-up” activities, which is to “stimulate more vigorous activities and more active communication,” “opportunities for dialogue” are held being peri-odically to enable face-to-face frank meetings between manage -
ment and employees, across the boundaries of the organization and as fellow employees.
In August 2012, starting with Fujifilm head office, these meet -
ings have been held in domestic factories, at affiliate companies and at subsidiaries outside Japan, and as of May 2013, over 30 such meetings had been held, with more than 1,000 participants. Participants were able to voice their issues with their work tasks and day-to-day concerns, while Mr. Nakajima spoke to them di -
rectly based on his own experience about the 3Cs (curiosity, com -
munication and courage) that he holds dear. Being able to directly answer each others’ concerns enabled people both to resolve their issues autonomously and contributed to an increase in motivation. We intend to continue to provide such “opportunities for dialogue” in the future, and work toward the further growth of our company and each of our employees.

Measures to Maximize Organizational Performance  through Diversity
I think that the Fujifilm Group’s measures to develop 
global human resources in accordance with the global growth of its business, and in particularly the program constructed to systematically develop global leaders, not simply limited to the current management levels but to include the next generation and the generation to follow that, should be evaluated very highly. However, while bearing this in mind, I would also like to point out the need to further enhance the effective utilization and development of human resources in the middle levels of the company, principally comprising general full-time employees, as a crucial element in aiming for sustain-able business deployment as a manufacturer. 
When one thinks about developing diverse human 
resources from a global perspective, there is a tendency to focus on the four categories of Japanese people and people from overseas, leaders and individual contribu-tors. But in fact, for a manufacturer, the general full-time employees constitute the core of the middle levels of the organization. There are a vast number of them, making things in the workplace and selling products to the market, and having them share the same philosophy and take pride in their work is the most important thing in the long term. In other words, they are the lifeblood of the organization. In the future, by also focusing its efforts on effectively utilizing and developing global human resources at the middle levels of the company, I hope to see the Fujifilm Group establish human resource measures able to produce constant sustainability in hu -
man resources, the ideal for a truly global company.

Founded on the conviction that occupational safety is the fountainhead of business activity, we 
are working to ensure employee protection by placing top priority on safety, and implementing exhaustive compliance with laws and regulations related to occupational health and safety.
Fujifilm Group Occupational Health and Safety Policy
The Fujifilm Group operates its businesses based on this policy, considering that the securing of em-ployees’ occupational health and safety is the most important basic element in its corporate activities.
1.  We will consider the employees’ occupational health and safety as top priority.
2.  We will proactively support the maintenance and promotion of employees’ health.
3.  We will realize the highest standard quality of employees’ occupational health and safety in 
response to the demands of society.
4.  We will establish smooth communications between all Fujifilm-related companies and their employees the regarding occupational health and safety.
5.  
We will actively provide employee education and training on occupational health and safety.Fujifilm Kanagawa factory was awarded

• Fujifilm
Fujifilm is conducting measures to create workplaces where our 
employees can work in good health and with peace of mind, based upon the safety policy laid down at each office, through awareness-raising among employees, activities to prevent fires and accidents, safety inspections at all level from the design, in -
stallation and operation of equipment, and checks and improve -
ment of workplaces including by external experts, and safety pa -
trols by the company and labor unions. 
In fiscal 2012, we expanded information sharing on work ac -
cidents, near misses and measures to prevent their recurrence, which had been conducted among domestic Fujifilm Group com -
panies. By sharing this knowledge, we go forward not only to pre -
vent the occurrence of similar accidents, but to promote safety activities of identification of danger spots and methods of investi -
gating the cause, etc. 
• Fuji Xerox
In fiscal 2012, we undertook various activities with a focus on pri -
ority goals, including preventing workplace accidents, preventing 
health effects due to long working hours, expanding education on mental health, and prohibiting smoking indoors at sites in Japan, and visualizing health indicators. Regarding the prevention of work accidents, we succeeded in reducing the number of work accidents compared to the previous year,* through the activities of the occupational health and safety committee to identify causes, to consider means of preventing recurrences, and to ensure thor -
ough understanding among employees at each site, and in the future too, we intend to continue to draw attention to these issues. 
Regarding activities to promote occupational health and 
safety in general, we are conducting activities to visualize our ac -
tivities, and in particular to visualize health indicators and we have reflected them in setting the targets for our activities in fiscal 2013.
* See page 63 for the work accident rate and work accident severity at Fuji 
Xerox. FUJIFILM Kyusyu is a young company where the average age of em-
ployees is 28 years old, but it was found that 85% of the people who were viewed as having health concerns (who were diagnosed as having something wrong) actually had metabolic syndrome. For this reason, we set a target that 20% or less of employees should be viewed as hav-ing health concerns, and set about conducting measures to achieve this. The key point was to use body composition data in which changes in the proportion of muscle and body fat as well as measurements of physical fitness are clearly shown. Health institutions, the internal health management department and the person’s direct manager got togeth -
er to make a system to manage the health and lifestyle improvements which had previously been left to each person alone. Body composition measurements were made obligatory once every two weeks, close support was provided for data sheet entry, exercise classes were held within the company (made possible by each person’s manager allowing them the time to participate), and multiple contracts were made with public sports facilities located close to the companies. As a result, we were able to achieve significant results, with five people achieving their targets, four people no longer being classified as having health con -
cerns, and 12 people who improved enough to achieve figures for good health in their medical examination, of the 26 people who participated in these efforts. In the future, we intend to enhance these activities by setting a target for achievement of only 20% of employees across the entire company having health concerns. 
●The Body Composition Data Results and Health Guidanceprevious year, at 93.8% (the previous year was 95.6%). Furthermore, since we had found in visiting assessments until now that in China there was a particularly large divergence in the self-checks conducted by our suppliers and the actual situation, we constructed a system to enable exhaustive confirmation by conducting visiting education programs on the basics of ethical procurement so that local buyers will be able to conduct basic confirmation of the suppliers they are responsible for. 
In the field of logistics, for all the logistics companies in Japan 
which are targets of ethical procurement, all companies achieved our target of a matching rate of 90% or more for the highest priority items (100 items; 98.5% achieved this in the previous year). In the future, in addition to further establishing these measures within Japan, we plan to gradually proceed with self-checks in areas ranging from the hub stores in the Asia Pacific region to the logistics in the respective countries.• Fujifilm
Since 2000 we have been making efforts for green procurement, which takes the environment into consideration. We later launched our examination for CSR procurement and on the occasion of the formulation of the Fujifilm Group Procurement Policy in 2009, we expanded the CSR self-check by adding society items which matched the Procurement Policy regarding corporate ethics, human rights and labor, etc. with the Corporate Greenness Survey up to that time, and we took the lead by beginning a trial survey of this at 70 of our major suppliers’ companies. As a result of using the CSR self-check which our suppliers conduct themselves, as well as ensuring that they understand our company’s approach to CSR by assessing and providing feedback on their self-check, they are conducting measures to maintain and improve their CSR activities. In fiscal 2012, we aimed to conduct the CSR self-check more efficiently and established a survey procedure by newly using an internet system. In fiscal 2013, using this system, we intend to go on to enhance the survey.
• Fuji Xerox
Fuji Xerox is making efforts with our suppliers to conduct ethical 
procurement in all our procurement activities, such as production materials as well as logistics and other indirect materials (paper, general purchases, etc.). 
In proceeding with ethical procurement, we are conducting 
measures in collaboration with our suppliers such as holding briefings, conducting self-checks, formulating plans to improve activities based on analysis results and offering support in activities to make improvements. In fiscal 2012, in the field of production materials, in consideration of the burden on our suppliers and toward the improvement of the matching ratio of the assessment of each supplier’s self-check and Fuji Xerox’s check, we asked continuous suppliers to submit a plan for the improvement of activities for items which did not match with our assessment in the previous year, and requested that new suppliers conduct a self-check on all items. We set a target of a matching rate of 90% or more for the highest priority items (57 items) and conducted awareness-raising activities among the management level on conducting visiting assessments. However, since approx. 7% were new suppliers, our achieved rate was slightly less than in the At the Fujifilm Group we not only conduct business activities with an awareness  emphasizing the 
importance of corporate ethics and social responsibility within our own company, but we also ob -
tain the understanding of our suppliers. With the goal of conducting such activities in coordination with them, we are enhancing partnerships with our suppliers that put in practice the principles of fair and impartial trade. In fiscal 2009, we formulated the Fujifilm Group Procurement Policy, which shows our approach regarding procurement that takes into consideration the concerns of CSR, and we are continuing to make efforts to improve our CSR activities in coordination with our suppliers.

Conflict Minerals
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the ad -
joining countries, illegal armed forces reportedly commit in -
humane crimes and cause violations of human rights or envi -
ronmental destruction in their pursuit of monetary gain 
through the mining of specific minerals (conflict minerals). Minerals mined in the regions include gold, tantalum, tung -
sten and tin which are indispensable to electrical and elec -
tronic industries. There is concern that the so called, “Conflict minerals” directly or indirectly finance or benefit illegal armed groups in the DRC or adjoining country. Fujifilm has declared that no intention to use the minerals mined or refined by illegal practices and no intention to take part in directly or indirectly financing or benefiting illegal groups. In August 2013, Fujifilm formulated its internal guideline which clarified roles and re -
sponsibilities for the relevant divisions. From fiscal 2013, Fujifilm intends to use common industry frameworks such as the EICC/GeSI template promoted by the electrical, electron -
ic, and automotive industries and to disseminate the frame -
works throughout the supply chain. ●●● Basic Approach

Four Fujifilm Group companies in the Kaisei district 
of Kanagawa Prefecture held an environmental dialogue meeting with local people
Fujifilm Kaisei District, Fuji Xerox, Takematsu Fuji Xerox 
Manufacturing and FUJIFILM Techno Products, which are located in the Kaisei district of Kanagawa, held a joint opinion exchange and environmental report meeting with local inhabitants in June 2012. The four companies held this first joint dialogue meeting to make better understanding of our activities as a whole Group effort. 
On the day, 29 people participated in the meeting from the 
local residents’ association. We made a tour of Fujifilm Advanced Research Laboratories and were briefed on the business and en -
vironmental activities of the four companies. Participants’ com -
ments include the following: “Because of this event I am able to understand how carefully the companies are implementing meas -
ures to prevent global warming, noise and pollution” and “I think Sending new employees to the afflicted areas as a means to support 
recovery through business operations
Fuji Xerox dispatched new employees to the afflicted areas as part of their training program and in 
its continuing efforts to support recovery from the disaster. In fiscal 2011 new employees were sent to Kesennuma Oshima, Miyagi Prefecture, and in fiscal 2012 a total of 260 employees were dispatched from Fuji Xerox and its Group companies to Ishinomaki City in Miyagi Prefecture. In sending a lot of new employees for training to the afflicted areas, Fuji Xerox has been accelerating its recovery support activities while also providing those dispatched employees with precious op -
portunities to learn through communication with local inhabitants and the staff of NGOs support -
ing the locals. During the local training period, which lasted for about a week, employees mainly focused on cleaning documents that were soiled in the disaster. Fuji Xerox conducted this activity jointly with a volunteer organization called “Tokyo Document Recovery Assistance Force” estab -
lished to support the recovery of documents and with a local volunteer organization named “Project YUI Consortium.” Participants worked to clean up official documents (about 24,000 sheets in total) belonging to local schools devastated by the disaster. In all, we restored 47 vol -
umes and 4,500 sheets (including 26 books) and also scanned and digitally restored one volume and 181 sheets. The workflow was documented by participating new employees for use in future volunteer activities.
There still remain a lot of documents to be cleaned up in the afflicted areas, and Fuji Xerox will 
continue to cooperate with Project YUI Consortium by sending employees to the areas as volun -
teers to clean up documents while also cleaning up documents in recovery support events held internally by the company.
Helping tourism to recover by supporting the organization of local events
Fuji Xerox helped to organize the recovery support marathon “Kesennuma Oshima Run Festa” held in Kesennuma Oshima, Miyagi Prefecture on May 27, 2012, and 87 volunteer employees of the company participated in the event. On the day, the company provided runners with the means to print commemorative photos (about 2,300 photos), photo calendars (about 600 copies) and also with its “ Kikitabi ” sound guidance service to entertain the runners. 
Also in Kesennuma Oshima, the company sent 12 volunteer employees to support local peo -
ple in opening the beach after an interval of two years. We helped to manage the changing rooms and clean up the beach, and offered photo calendar and sound guidance services to visitors to the beach.
“Connecting Photo Project” to support recovery through photos  
(former Photo Rescue Project)
Fujifilm launched its Photo Rescue Project soon after the disaster, and in fiscal 2012 the company 
shifted the focus of the project to supporting the organizations engaged in returning photos to victims of the disaster and the volunteers participating in cleaning photos. By holding a regular Photo Rescue Summit, we are enhancing cooperation with the organizations involved and sharing appropriate know-how.
The photo rescue activity has been expanded to support victims of other disasters. For exam -
ple, we provided the means to restore photos damaged by flooding in Yame City in Fukuoka Prefecture after the heavy rain that hit the northern part of Kyushu. Also, the photo cleaning method explained on our global website was adopted in flooded areas in Indonesia. In fiscal 2013, we renamed the project, “Connecting Photo Project,” and are placing a greater importance on disaster recovery support through photographs. Emphasis will be given to creating an archive of photographs related with the Great East Japan Earthquake, keeping people’s attention on disas -
ter, and continuing assistance in returning salvaged photographs to their owners.
The Photo Rescue Project website won the grand prize in the social contribution & CSR divi -
sion at the Sixth Japan Web Grandprix.
Using knowledge of radioactivity to foster recovery hand in hand with local 
communities 
FUJIFILM Finechemicals’ Hirono Factory is located only 21 km away from Tokyo Electric Power’s 
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. Supported by FUJIFILM RI Pharma, which is engaged in R&D, and the production and sale of radiopharmaceuticals, the factory comprehensively decon -
taminated its premises extending over 140,000 m
2 and lowered the radiation levels to below the 
criteria set by the national government. The factory also educates local inhabitants on radioactivity and holds a recovery symposium in Futaba-gun with the participation of the mayor of Hirono Town and university members to help with the recovery, hand in hand with local communities.
When the round table meeting of the representatives of the Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives was held in Iwaki City, Fukushima Prefecture in November 2012, participants made a tour of the fully recovered Hirono Factory. Also in the Great East Japan Earthquake memorial symposium held in Sendai on March 11, 2013, President Kawamoto of FUJIFILM Finechemicals was a panelist and gave a presentation, and this was introduced in the PR magazine of the association.that the four companies are unified.” The meeting thus provided the companies with a great opportunity to exchange opinions with local people, and we will continue to work together with the Group companies in the future.
After making a tour of the Fujifilm Advanced Research Laboratories, 
participants were briefed on the activities of the four companies  and then exchanged opinions with employees.Dry cleaning for restoring documents by new employees (upper) and  the documents before and after restoring (lower)

FeatureIntegration of Business and Social Contributions
As the embodiment of its corporate philosophy, 
a company’s social contribution activities are one with its business. 
As the embodiment of its corporate philosophy, a com-
pany’s social contribution activities are one with its business. Reading this report from that perspective, this sort of spirit and determination is evident at the Fujifilm Group. Proof of it can be seen in the report on the sup-port activities for recovery efforts from the Great East Japan Earthquake. At a time when people say enthu-siasm for such support efforts is beginning to wane in Japan, one can extract from reading this report both the results produced by Fujifilm fulfilling its mission as a company and an appetite to do more to help in the future, reminding me of Raymond Chandler’s words: “If I wasn't hard, I wouldn't be alive. If I couldn't ever be gentle, I wouldn't deserve to be alive.” Stakeholder dialogue reports are also important for confirming the role of the company within society. I hope that such dialogues will be carried out in each region in the fu -
ture. The reports of activities at each of the different factories are wide-ranging, and valuable in providing hints to all the other regions. However, they might be easier to understand if they were included in this report after being organized into their respective themes and areas. 
Support activities which make good use of both 
the company’s main business and regional character -
istics are useful in promoting the understanding of stakeholders and in developing business globally too. By proceeding with the individual social contribution activities made up to now and keeping more closely in line with particular themes, I hope to see the Fujifilm Group’s further development as a strong but gentle company in the future.
Response to the third-party opinion

We intend to continue to further deepen our relationships with our stakeholders in every region, by strategically promot -

FeatureProducts and Services which Reflect  
Our Customers’ Views
As we declare in our corporate philosophy, the Fujifilm Group aims to provide the best quality prod -
ucts and services which are safe, appealing to customers and provide them with peace of mind, by 
basing our management on “Customer Satisfaction (CS).” In order to achieve customer satisfaction, it is important to obtain the views of a wide range of customers and to have a mechanism in place for effectively reflecting these in our products and services. For this purpose, we pay special atten -
tion to communicating with our customers at customer centers which are our point of contact with them. We aim to correctly grasp their views, as well as seek to respond in a speedy, kind, accurate and fair manner, and we are constructing a system to link these views to improvements in product development and our work processes.
Efforts to raise Customer Satisfaction (CS)
• Fujifilm
Since Fujifilm deploys its businesses in a wide range of fields, it 
has a wide variety of customers, from companies and hospitals to regular consumers, and it responds to their views according to the special characteristics of each product respectively. Each customer center reports our customers’ proposals and requests to the respective product departments, and they appraise the contents and consider them in the development and planning of new products and in improvements to existing products and serv -
ices. In fiscal 2012, in the Life Science Products division, which handles cosmetics and health supplements, we held “customer meetings” at which we were able to hear the views and requests of customers directly, and we are continuing to promote various measures toward increasing customer satisfaction.• Fuji Xerox
At Fuji Xerox, we believe that customer satisfaction (CS) is funda -
mental to all our corporate activities. It is important to know the demands and expectations of customers in order to enhance cus -
tomer satisfaction. For this reason, we place emphasis on creat -
ing opportunities and points for communication with customers such as by means of the following five mechanisms to respond sincerely and directly to the voices of customers: (1) Call centers (main contact point for inquiries); (2) Voice of Customer (VOC) (mechanism for comprehensively collecting information from cus -
tomers); (3) Official website; (4) Various types of market research -
es; and (5) CS programs (improvement activities based on CS surveys). Furthermore, within the company, we have constructed a 3-layer CS system comprising ‘CS improvement committee,’ ‘CS Improvement at Customer Contact Points Committee and the Quality Review Committee’ and ‘CS Executive Meeting,’ to pro -
mote our CS activities. 
Among these activities, we have been continuously conduct -
ing the CS program which assesses the products provided to customers and our sales activities, etc. since 1975. By conducting this continuously and periodically, it has been useful in improving satisfaction and constructing long-term trust relationships with customers, through correctly grasping the current status of Customer Satisfaction (CS) and taking measures to improve on our business processes and mechanisms. In addition, we reflect these results not only in the sales or customer services & support divisions which responsible for looking after customers, but also feed them back to the product planning & development divisions  to reflect in new products. Despite the fact that the occurrence of breast cancer is common among women, the proportion of women over 40, the highest risk group, who undergo testing is only 31.4%*. One of the causes of this is thought to be the pain and discomfort caused when pres -
sure is applied to the breast to hold it still while doing the mam -
mographic screening. It is necessary to compress the breast firmly and extend the mammary gland still when doing the mam -
mographic screening but when doing so, we discovered that be -
cause the highest degree of pressure is concentrated upon the part of the breast which is thickest, it tends to cause severe pain to this portion. 
Fujifilm aimed to provide an environment to make it easier for 
women to undergo testing by reducing their concern about the pain of mammographic screening and developed AMULET series of digital x-ray equipment for the early detection of breast cancer. In particular, Fit Sweet (FS) compression plate which was released in April 2013 is designed to disperse the pressure normally con -
centrated on the thickest part of the breast, making it possible to compress evenly along the natural curve of the breast with ap -
propriate but not excessive force. In the future, we intend to de -
velop products which will enable the early detection of breast cancer, by taking into consideration the views of our customers, and smooth diagnosis for doctors, improvement of usability for radiographers and comfort mammogram exam for women in worldwide.
* Proportion of women who undergo testing is 31.4%: based on “Data on 
cancer test taking by prefecture and major city based on the basic survey of people’s lifestyles,” by the Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, Japan (2010).  Manufacturing which responds to the needs to  
a wide variety of customers
• Fujifilm
Since 2001, the Usability Design Group which is responsible for 
product design has been assessing products based on their us -
ability, from the perspective of “ease of use.” As well as selecting multiple assessments by users based on consideration of the tar -
get and intended usage etc. of the product, this group also con -
ducts verification etc. in the workplace of use. In cases of prod -
ucts which we plan to deploy globally, we conduct verification by country based on the differences in culture and environment, etc. and use the results of this analysis in product design. For exam -
ple, we had engineers in the workplace in Japan, the U.S. and three countries in Europe use the printing process Workflow System XMF 5.0, and verified its efficiency and their levels of sat -
isfaction. We used their views in features such as using colors which take into consideration long hours of use, easily visible icons, only displaying the necessary screens to reduce mistakes, etc. This simple and functional design which is easy for various operators to use was evaluated highly and the XMF won the 2012 Good Design Award. 
Usability assessment at first took a long time to permeate 
into our ways of working but now it is well established in our prod -
uct design in various fields, starting with medical devices, with persons responsible for it increasingly participating in projects from the early stages of development. • Fuji Xerox
We are proceeding with product development based on the three elements that we consider make up universal design: “accessibil -
ity” to make it available for use “usability” to make it easier to use “user diversity” to expand the range of users. Based on the infor -
mation collected from visiting our customers, etc. and from the customer views provided to our companies, we consider the de -
sign based upon combining beauty and ease of use. Based on various types of internal guidelines which reflect ISOs and our al -
liance with JIS, our designers make our products after conducting and evaluating simulated experiences of partially-sighted persons or people in wheelchairs operating them, as well as design, devel -
opment and operability tests, etc.

Customer Co-Creation Laboratory between Fuji 
Xerox and its customers, which aims for the creation of new values together with our customers
Fuji Xerox has established three locations in order to enhance our 
support for solving issues of our customers, at the “Customer Value Innovation Center,” the “Integrated Customer Support Center,” and the “Customer Co-creation Laboratory,” in Yokohama City, Kanagawa prefecture. Among these, the Customer Co-Creation Laboratory was opened in the Fuji Xerox R&D Square in 2010, aiming to “create new values thoroughly based on the customer’s perspective,” and it is drawing attention as an unprecedented place to develop the sprouts of new value creation.
The Customer Co-Creation Laboratory is composed of the 
Open laboratory and the Secure laboratory. The open laboratory provides a place for clarifying the customer’s business challenges as well as the potential issues which customers may not yet have noticed. Fuji Xerox provides an introduction to the latest case studies of management solutions it has provided to resolve its customers issues or used internally and related technology, and then we conduct discussions based on these case studies and by looking at the customer’s business challenges in the light of them. At the secure laboratory, we develop the seeds of new value creation that were carefully selected in the open laboratory by repeated discussions and verification by Fuji Xerox, its customers and partners, and link them to the provision of actual solutions. Since it was opened three years ago, approx. 1,000 companies and 4,000 people have visited the open laboratory. In particular, recently we are receiving an increasing number of visitors due to increasing awareness among customers and sales departments.
For Fuji Xerox, this also provides us with an unprecedented 
opportunity to come into contact with our customers (particularly people at the top management levels) and grasp their needs by hearing their business challenges from them directly. In addition, for our employees in our R&D division, we are able to introduce our newest technologies which have not yet even been made into products directly to our customers and have the opportunity to discuss these with them, leading to higher levels of motivation and to us noticing issues that we had not previously been aware of. 
In the future, we aim to construct a place for innovation to re -
solve social challenges by promoting the fusion of various aspects of knowledge from industry, government and academia and strengthening our collaboration with local and regional authorities.Fuji Xerox ranked top in external institutions’

I. Basic Procurement Concepts
As a responsible member of the international community, the Fujifilm Group seeks to contribute to the development of society and enhancement of the quality of life of people throughout the world by providing top-quality products and services. In order to achieve these objectives, we perform procurement activities based on the following basic concepts:

We will select suppliers based upon rational and clear standards, such as 
quality, price, delivery assurance and operating stability, so as to procure superior goods and services from the most competitive sources. Decisions on procurement are made by the Procurement Division, which is independ-ent from other divisions.2. Openness and fairness
We will impartially provide all Japanese and overseas suppliers with op-portunities to supply their products and services to us. In addition, we will vigorously strive to procure these not only from suppliers involved in past transactions, but from newcomers as well.
3. Corporate social responsibility (CSR)
In conducting our procurement activities, we will seek to proactively fulfill our role as a good corporate citizen contributing to the society by taking into consideration CSR related factors such as compliance to regulations, product quality/safety, environment conservation, information security, fair trade, ethics, workers’ safety/hygiene, human rights, and fair labor practices.
We will seek our suppliers’ understanding of our policies and ask them to perform procurement activities by following the Procurement Guideline below to establish and further beneficial partnerships based on mutual trust.

■ Annual changes in CO 2 emissions  (Fujifilm: six major factories in Japan) Annual changes in amount of CO 2 emissions and CO 2 emissions per unit 
of output at the six major chemical factories in Japan*
Total output from the six factories in 2012 reduced by 4% over 2011. Thus 
CO2 emissions per unit (per production volume) improved by one percent.
Although there was slight drop in production output compared to the pre-
vious year, energy consumption increased due to startup of new production equipment and new product development. During 2012, we continued im-plementing exhaust heat recovery system across the production lines for flat panel materials and others. Various measures to improve energy efficiency have also been installed as planned, including energy conservation measures in manufacturing processes, reduction in stand-by energy consumption and the fixed energy that is consumed regardless of production volume, as well as improving cogeneration energy conversion efficiency. As a result of such efforts, in 2012 we achieved a 40% improvement in CO
2 emissions per pro-
duction unit compared with 1990 levels.
* C O2 emissions from the six major chemical factories in Japan (Fujifilm Kanagawa Factory’s 
Ashigara and Odawara Sites, Fujifilm Fujinomiya and Yoshida-Minami Factories, FUJIFILM Opto 
materials Co., Ltd. and FUJIFILM Kyusyu Co., Ltd.) account for 52% of the total emissions from the Fujifilm Group worldwide (including the Fujifilm Group inside and outside Japan, the Fuji Xerox Group and TOYAMA CHEMICAL). (see page 65)* Production CO
2 per unit: Shown as indices, with CO 2 emissions per unit of production in fiscal 
1990 set at 100

■ Surveying and remediating soil and underground water pollution   
(FUJIFILM Corporation and its domestic affiliates/Fuji Xerox and its domestic affiliates )
The Fujifilm Group autonomously conducts environmental surveys on soil and 
underground water pollution. Regarding substances that are used at manu-facturing facilities and that are subject to environmental limits set by regula-tions, the Group rigorously manages the usage and storage of such sub-stances and monitors the concentrations of such substances in underground water. We are prepared to deal with any unforeseen pollution incidents in a timely fashion.■Legal compliance and reports on complaints in fiscal 2012
In 2012, there were eight violations of environment-related laws (of which six were overseas) and six customer complaints (all in Japan). The major issue involved in these violations was wastewater—where an excess of specified chemicals was temporarily released. All of the violations were ad-dressed immediately, and efforts will be made to implement further exhaus-tive controls to prevent any recurrence.

level of waste management. A future goal is to achieve zero emissions at Fujifilm’s overseas affiliates (i.e., production site) and at the companies newly affiliated with the Fujifilm Group. We will continue to instruct mainly the following affiliates in order to achieve this goal:
1.  Domestic and overseas affiliates that have not achieved zero emissions 
with regard to waste generated from launching or closing a plant
2.  Domestic and overseas affiliates that generated large amounts of waste
3.  Domestic and overseas affiliates for which productions is growing and 
which are far from achieving zero emissions
As to the definition of “zero emissions” used by Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox, there is a slight difference between the two companies attributable to their business characteristics, but the term generally refers to recycling all waste generated in business activities and making the amount of waste that is simply incinerated or buried at a landfill site zero.

Environmental Accounting■Overview of fiscal 2012
● Expenditure on improving working conditions and for socially beneficial 
activities for different stakeholders is summarized.
● Efforts are made to create a worker-friendly environment through 
expanding educational seminars and supporting mental healthcare 
programs.
● For local communities, expenditure includes a donation to build the 
Japan Photographic Preservation Center and a product donation to the 
Nature Conservation Society of Japan.
In the promotion of art and culture, expenditure includes Fujifilm Square as the base for preservation and communication concerning photograph-ic culture, as well as for photo contests.
■Overview of fiscal 2012
●   Environmental conservation costs
Overall costs were reduced by 4%. Approximately 10% of total costs was for facility investment and 90% was expenditure. This ratio is almost the same as the previous year. 
[Facility investments]
Increased by ¥500 million or 10% year-on-year. Approx. 75% of the invest-ment was directed to global environment protection, including energy con-servation in flat panel display production facilities.
[Expenditure]
Expenditure was reduced by ¥2.69 billion or 6% year-on-year, through ef-ficient measures in workplace. R&D costs occupy approx. 40% of the entire expenditure.
●  Environmental conservation benefits
The economic effect grew year-on-year both internally and externally.
[Internal economic effect]
Slightly increased by ¥900 million or 4% year-on-year.
[External economic effect]
Rise in benefits for customers led to a marked increase of ¥18.4 billion or 18% year-on-year.
■Customer benefits
The customer benefits were calculated in amounts through comparing the 
use of a new product purchased by the client with the environmental burden when the customer uses an older product.
Total customer benefits for 2012 increased by ¥19.3 billion or 22% over 
the previous year. The effect increased with the rise in volume of shipment of printing film-free PS plates across the world. In office printers, greater implementation of energy-conservation technology that combines EA-Eco Toner and IH fusing led the increase in power-saving effects.<Period of coverage>

2013 is more organized and consistent than previous issues, successfully delivering the key features of Group CSR Management in an easy-to-understand manner. This is surely the result of having a clear theme—“innovation”—running throughout this year’s Special Feature. It serves as the backbone of the entire report and clarifies miscellaneous efforts associated with the theme, thereby integrating the entire report. 
One of the features of Fujifilm Group CSR manage -
ment is its diversity. This is, as described clearly in the Top Commitment, a result of continuous expansion of business fields through innovation. In one sense, it is natural that a corporate group faces more social chal -
lenges as it expands its business fields. However, expand -
ing business fields presupposes possession of excellent technology, and the corporate group then has to under -
take a process of permeating the generated innovation throughout partners in the supply chain and in the market. Therefore, the fact that Fujifilm Group operates multidi-mensional CSR management clearly suggests that it has advanced communication skills across multiple channels, which have led its innovations to success. This year’s report brought this unseen pathway—from innovation to society—into the spotlight through articles on spreading the use of transnasal endoscopes and process-less CTP plates that require no development process. These items demonstrate typical CSR realized through their core busi-ness in an impressive manner. Fujifilm Group’s report is already unique in terms of presenting opinions collected one by one from among extensive stakeholders. This year’s report placed the emphasis on the reason why the company regard communications with different parties in society as important by linking such communication with their competitiveness. 
Another feature in the report is “materiality,” which 
is used as the selection criterion for a variety of informa-tion handled by the Group’s management. This further demonstrates the Group’s originality by accentuating its wide-ranging CSR. Although each of the contents se -
lected from the viewpoint of “materiality” offers a point for consideration, I found the following topics particu -
larly impressive: (1) The Group’s effort to visualize envi-ronmental contribution through their products based on advanced eco-conscious design; (2) Full consideration for human rights and employees’ health, which are relatively new concepts in Japanese corporations; and (3) Advanced management of the supply chain using CSR self-checks and feedback. All of these relate to problems that many corporations are facing and is useful information targeted at wider stakeholders in various economic circles.
The report is completed to a high standard by em -
phasizing broad CSR information with materiality and making efforts to examine their validity through commu-nication with stakeholders. Further improvements could be made through extensions of this direction. The first suggestion I would like to make concerns the mid-term targets in different aspects. These seem to remain fixed. I believe it is worth considering converting these targets to more concrete numbers and presenting them as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). It is difficult to choose an activity as a KPI and doing so sometimes makes the level of achievement rather too visible. However, I believe it is a highly transparent and reproducible approach that will enable Fujifilm Group to further reinforce its great strength—close communicability with its stakeholders. Also, the report covers multiple overseas case studies under the editorial policy of “global”; however, they could perhaps be more consistently organized as in the domes-tic information in the first half of the report. I hope that the report will be further improved as one of your most important communication tools.

Important Cultural Property
The Kyoto National Museum Collection
* The front cover photos comprise a whole view picture 
on the left and two partial view pictures on the right. 
The sides of this large, hexagonal lantern 
are decorated with openwork designs of linked jewels, pine-bark diamonds, linked tortoise-shells, Sanskrit characters and a pair of Kongo Rikishi (Vajra-pani) on the door. From the openwork inscription, it is known to be the oldest, dated hanging lantern. It was made by Sadasumi of Owari Province, and was formerly owned by Chor yoji temple in Hakusan. Its archaic form and the exquisite, detailed craftsmanship of its decorative designs are representative of Kamakura-period metalwork.
