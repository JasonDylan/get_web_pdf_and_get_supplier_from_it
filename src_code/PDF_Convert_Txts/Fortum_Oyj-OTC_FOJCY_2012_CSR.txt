The instability in the European economy has made our
operating environment more challenging.In order to maintain our strategic flexibility and to secure our
competitiveness, we launched an ef ficiency programme
aiming to strengthen the cash flow by over one billion euros in
2013–2014.

Fortum's Power Division is responsible for power generation
andtrading in the Nordic wholesale electricity markets and for
providing expert services to electricity and heat producers globally .
Hydropower and nuclear power account for the majority of Fortum's production. In
2012, about 97% of the division's power generation was carbon dioxide-free and
50% was based on renewable energy sources. Its power plants in Finland and
Sweden produced 49.2 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity in 2012 (201 1: 48.1).
Fortum's hydropower capacity in Finland is about 1,500 megawatts (MW) and in
Sweden about 3,100 MW .At the end of 2012, Fortum owned or co-owned 191
hydropower plants.
Focus on large-scale hydropower
Fortum is currently implementing a hydropower plant refurbishment programme
that will increase the production and improve the ef ficiency and safety of the
hydropower plants. The investment programme will increase Fortum's
hydropower capacity by about 100 MW by 2020.
In 2012, Fortum started the multi-year refurbishment of the Pyhäkoski power plant
in Finland. In Sweden, the Gammalängen and Långån power plants, among
others, were refurbished. Fortum also launched a sizable refurbishment project of
the Höljes power plant dam in Sweden; the refurbishment will bring the dam up to
the latest dam safety requirements.
Fortum divested 100 small hydropower plants in Finland and Sweden in 2012 and
early 2013. The total capacity of the divested small hydropower plants was about
102 MW , i.e. about 2% of Fortum's total hydropower capacity .
In 2012, Fortum continued preparations for the tender process for hydropower
concessions in France.
Nuclear power safety assessments
andimprovements continued
In Finland, Fortum fully owns the Loviisa power plant and has a 26.6%
shareholding in two Olkiluoto reactors. In Sweden, Fortum has a 22%
shareholding in the production of the Forsmark power plant and a 43%
shareholding in the production of the Oskarshamn power plant. Fortum's nuclear
power capacity was 3,247 MW at the end of 2012. Projects related to
modernisations and capacity upgrades continued at the Forsmark and
Oskarshamn nuclear power plants in 2012.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Heat Division
Fortum's Heat Division concentrates on combined heat and power
(CHP) production and the distribution of district heating. During the
year,Fortum continued its investments into new CHP
production and developed new products for district heating and
cooling.
Fortum owns 18 CHP plants in the Nordic countries, the Baltic countries and
Poland. The company has extensive experience in CHP production, waste-to-
energy , and district heating and cooling. Fortum's customers are businesses and
private consumers. In terms of volume (including heat production reported in the
Heat and Russia Divisions), Fortum is one of the largest heat producers in the
world.
The Heat Division's heat sales volumes in 2012 amounted to 19.7 TWh (201 1:
22.6) and power sales volumes totalled 4.2 TWh (201 1: 6.2). Heat was produced
mainly in the Nordic countries.
During 2012, Fortum divested heat operations in Finland and Estonia.
Additionally , the restructuring of the T urku region energy production in Finland
decreased the volumes. The power production in Finland was lower also due to
the low power market price. Higher sales of CO 2emission allowances contributed
positively to the result and of fset some of the lost volume.
New CHP production under construction
Construction of the four CHP plants in Järvenpää (Finland), Brista (Sweden),
Jelgava (Latvia), and Klaipeda (Lithuania) advanced according to plan in 2012.
Additionally , Fortum made an investment decision to construct a new , biofuel-fired
CHP plant at the Värtan CHP plant in Stockholm, Sweden. The annual output of
the new plant is estimated to be about 1,700 GWh (gigawatt-hours) heat and 750
GWh electricity . The share of bioenergy at the Värtan plant will grow from its 45%
today to 70% when the new plant is completed, which is estimated to be in 2016.
In Stockholm, the construction of a new silo for biofuel and a new transporting
system in connection with the Värtan plant has been started. The project is
scheduled for completion at the end of 2013 and operational testing will start at
the beginning of 2014. The investment will increase the use of biofuel at the plant
and consequently will reduce the area's CO 2emissions by 50,000 tonnes on a
yearly basis.
New heat products and advantages for
customers
In 2012, Fortum opened up the possibility for customers in Stockholm, Sweden,
to sell the surplus heat they produce to Fortum's grid at market price. The aim is
for all customers to be able to sell their surplus heat to the grid starting in 2014.
Combined heat and
power production is an
effective means to
reduce the
environmental impacts
of energy production
and to reduce CO 2
emissions.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Fortum also introduced new products for district heating customers in Sweden
and Finland. Customers and tenant-owner associations can now choose between
different types of products depending on their consumption profile and
preference, rather than having only one option as earlier . Fortum is actively
developing itsdistrict heating of fering; in October 2012 it started a development
project with three pilot customers in Finland.
Research and development brings new
CHP solutions
Energy- and resource-ef ficient CHP is an ef fective means to reduce the
environmental impacts of energy production and to reduce CO 2emissions. CHP
production can utilise a flexible mix of fuels, including local fuels, so that also the
environmental impact associated with fuel transports is reduced.
In March, Fortum made a decision to invest about EUR 20 million in the
commercialisation of new technology by building a bio-oil plant connected to the
Joensuu power plant in Finland. Upon completion of the investment, in addition to
electricity and heat, the plant will also produce bio-oil, which can be used to
replace fossil fuels used in energy production. In the future, bio-oil has the
potential to be used as a raw material for dif ferent biochemicals or traf fic fuels.
Energy produced with bio-oil reduces greenhouse gas emissions by more than
70% compared to fossil fuels.
Fortum is actively researching and developing other new CHP solutions that are
even more sustainable, such as new biofuels. The Heat Division has tested the
use of, e.g., olive pits and straw as fuel. At the Czestochowa CHP plant in
Poland, new biomasses have been tested in collaboration with the local
University of T echnology . The project aims to increase the use of biomass at the
plant and to replace coal with biomass.

Fortum's Russia Division produces and sells electricity and heat in
Russia's biggest industrial regions. Electricity is sold on the
wholesale market and heat on the local markets.
In 2012, the electricity sales in the Russia Division were 23.3 TWh and heat sales
26.4 TWh. At year end, the total capacity of the power plants was 3,404 MW
electricity and 13,396 MW heat.
The Russia Division includes the subsidiary OAO Fortum, which operations are
based in the metals producing area of Urals and the oil and gas rich W estern
Siberia. OAO Fortum has eight power plants with mainly gas-fired CHP capacity .
The Division also includes Fortum's over 25% holding in the territorial generating
company TGC-1 that operates in north-west Russia.
In August 2012, OAO Fortum's operations in Russia received ISO 14001
environmental certification. Consequently , the ISO 14001 certification rate of all
Fortum operations is 95%.
In December 2012, Fortum's subsidiary in Russia, OAO Fortum, delisted its
shares on the Moscow Stock Exchange. Stocks of OAO Fortum were excluded
from the Moscow Stock Exchange List B already in October 2008 and had since
been included in the unlisted securities section. More than 90% of OAO Fortum
has been owned by Fortum Corporation since 2008.
Investment programme progressed
The key driver for Fortum's growth in Russia is the extensive investment
programme under the Russian government's Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA),
originally agreed upon in 2008. The plan is to conclude the investement
programme by the end of 2014. OAO Fortum's total electricity production capacity
will almost double upon completion of the investment programme, rising to over
5,100 MW due to power plant units using modern combined-cycle gas turbine
technology .
The investment programme's biggest units are being constructed in Nyagan, in
Western Siberia. Construction of the three 418-MW power plant units utilising
energy-ef ficient gas turbine technology continued in 2012, but the commissioning
of the two first units was slightly postponed. It is estimated that the Nyagan units
will be commissioned during 2013.
During the second quarter of 2012, Fortum announced that it will build the last
two units of its Russian CSA-backed investment programme in Chelyabinsk ,
where the energy needs of the metal industry are growing. Initially , the units were
planned to be constructed in the T yumen region. The new units will be
constructed at the Chelyabinsk GRES plant and are estimated to be
commissioned by the end of 2014. Additionally , the power plant's existing
equipment will be modernised and the capacity increased. Upon completion of
the projects, the total capacity of Chelyabinsk GRES will increase to 750 MW .

In addition to the investment programme, Fortum continuously upgrades and
modernises its power plants and heat distribution networks in Russia. The goal is
to improve resource ef ficiency , reduce heat loss, ensure access to energy in cities
and better serve customers.
Projects aiming to improve the energy ef ficiency of OAO Fortum's power plants
continued in 2012. Installation of new gas turbine equipment was started at
Chelyabinsk CHP-1; the equipment will increase the plant's total electricity
production capacity by 88 MW . Modernisation of the plants will help to meet the
electricity needs of industries in the region and improve the security of supply and
energy ef ficiency .
Making heat networks energy efficient
Fortum is building modern and energy-ef ficient heat distribution systems for the
cities in its operating areas in Russia. The modernisation of the Chelyabinsk
district heating networks continued in 2012. In the project, the city's heat
distribution network is being changed from a radial design to an encircling design
to allow the load to be distributed more evenly .
Development of a modern heat distribution system will continue also in T yumen.
The infrastructure development programme being implemented in collaboration
with the regional government will improve the reliability of heat delivery and
decrease the amount of heat energy lost by one third in certain sections of the
main distribution network.

Fortum's Distribution business area owns, operates and develops
regional and local electricity networks and supplies electricity to a
total of 1.6 million customers in Finland, Sweden and Norway .
Fortum's electricity distribution network has a total length of approximately
156,000 km, which is the equivalent of nearly four times around the globe. Fortum
aims to ensure a reliable and consistent supply of electricity to customers. The
reliability of the electricity networks in Finland, Sweden and Norway was
improved through more than 4,000 network projects in 2012.
At the end of January 2013, Fortum decided that the company will assess future
alternatives oftheelectricity distribution business. Fortum expects to conclude the
assessment during 2013.
Network reliability increasingly important
Fortum is continuously investing to renew , maintain and further improve reliability
in the networks. In the Nordic countries, the reliability of electricity supply is at a
very high level. The reliability of Fortum's electricity distribution is over 99.98%.
In Finland, the winter storms at the end of 201 1 put an increased focus on the
reliability of electricity distribution. In February 2012, Fortum established a new
programme to accelerate the building of a weather-proof network in Finland.
Investments in the Distribution business area in Finland, Sweden and Norway
totalled EUR 324 million in 2012. The majority of these investments targeted new
lines, replacing and isolating overhead lines, underground cables, automation of
the critical parts of the grid and the rollout of smart metering.
Customer needs steer development of the
electricity grids
An increased share of renewable energy , distributed energy systems and higher
energy ef ficiency exert new demands on the grid. T o meet future needs, Fortum
continued to research smarter and more flexible grids in 2012.
In 2012, Fortum moved to the implementation phase of the research
project Royal Seaport, in Stockholm, Sweden. In this sustainable urban area
under construction, more flexible grids, energy storage and smart-home solutions
can be tested. Fortum also finished a joint project with Skanska, ABB and KONE
to develop an eco-conscious urban living concept in Espoo, Finland.

society development
Electricity distribution is regulated by national authorities in order to support the
development of society . While consumers and society demand higher reliability
and more flexibility from electricity distribution, regulatory models should provide
incentives for the investments.
A new network income regulatory period came into ef fect both in Finland and
Sweden on 1 January 2012. In Finland, the Energy Market Authority (EMV)
introduced some changes to the regulation model going in to the third regulatory
period, 2012-2015. The industry found some of the changes unreasonable and
appealed the new model to the Market Court. The Market Court ruling came in
December 2012 and requires that sanctions, due to outages caused by big
storms, have to have an annual maximum limit in the regulation model.
In Sweden, the Energy Market Inspectorate (EI) introduced a new network
income regulation model with a first regulatory period of 2012-2015. With the new
model, Sweden moved to a pre-regulation model where the allowed income for a
four-year period is decided by EI in advance. Among other things, the new model
introduced a transition rule that Fortum and approximately half of the Swedish
network companies believe lacks legal ground. The network companies therefore
appealed the new network regulation. During the fall, EI agreed to some
adjustments to the model, but the court appeal continues.
Rollout of smart metering continues
The implementation of smart metering in Finland continues. By the end of 2012,
434,000 customers had received a new smart meter; and by the end of 2013, a
total of 620,000 customers will have received new meters. Services and invoicing
based on real consumption are the most noteworthy changes to the customers.
The regulation on hourly meter reading will come into ef fect on 1 January 2014.
In Sweden, smart metering with monthly measurement was completed in 2009.
During 2012, the Swedish Parliament passed a new bill on hourly measurement
and, from 1 October 2012, customers with an electricity sales agreement
requiring hourly resolution have been provided with hourly measurement.
The installation of new smart meters in Norway is planned to begin in 2014. The
goal is for all 100,000 customers in Fortum's network area in Norway to be
connected to the system by 2016. The regulation on hourly meter reading in
Norway will come into ef fect on 1 January 2019.

Fortum is one of the leading electricity sales companies in the
Nordic region. The company markets and sells electricity to 1.2
million customers in Sweden, Finland and Norway .
Fortum is one of the leading sellers of CO 2-free and eco-labelled electricity in the
Nordic countries. In 2012, the company sold a total of 13.0 terawatt-hours (TWh)
of electricity (201 1: 14.4). The decrease in the electricity sales volume was due to
the restructuring of the business customer segment; the restructuring was
completed in 201 1.
In 2012, Fortum continued to concentrate its electricity sales under its own brand.
In September , Fortum sold its 18.7% ownership in the Swedish electricity retail
sales company Dala Kraft AB to Swedish energy company Jämtkraft AB.
The changing retail markets
Fortum buys the electricity that it sells on the retail markets through the Nordic
power exchange Nord Pool Spot. The wholesale market price is formed on the
basis of the balance between electricity supply and demand.
About 350 electricity producers sell electricity in the Nordic wholesale market,
where approximately the same number of retailers buy electricity and then re-sell
it to customers on national retail markets. Consumers can choose their electricity
supplier and companies compete for customers. Business is characterised by
economies of scale and small margins.
The goal in upcoming years is to transition from national retail markets to a pan-
Nordic electricity retail market. The development work aims for a model where the
electricity supplier is the main contact for the customer also in electricity
distribution-related issues, i.e. in issues related to the electricity possibly delivered
by another company . The new operating model would improve customer
friendliness and ef ficiency , but would require significant process and system
development work.
In 2012, Nordic energy ministers supported the further development of the
formation of a common Nordic consumer market. Also Fortum supports the
creation of a pan-Nordic retail market.
Smart services save energy
The EU’ s Energy Ef ficiency Directive approved in 2012 requires energy
companies to help their customers reduce energy consumption. At the same time,
the customers’ changing needs require electricity companies to of fer smarter
solutions for electricity consumption. Advancements in technology have enabled
the hourly measurement of electricity consumption, the use of solar panels as
part of own electricity usage, and easy-to-use customer service mobile

Origin of electricity matters
In recent years, the interest in and demand for eco-labelled electricity that is
produced from renewable energy sources with a guarantee of origin has steadily
increased.
Fortum has turned this into a competitive advantage, and the company is one of
the leading sellers of CO 2-free electricity with a guarantee of origin in the Nordic
countries. Fortum also of fers electricity with the Finnish Association for Nature
Conservation's EKOenergy label in Finland and with the Swedish Society for
Nature Conservation's Good Environmental Choice label in Sweden. Since 2009,

The unstable economic situation in Europe and globally – and the
uncertainty regarding its duration – af fected Fortum's business
operations in 2012. W e aim to ensure the prerequisites for our
growth also in a continuing challenging market situation. That is why
we continued investments to support long-term targets while also
improving the ef ficiency of our current operations.
Europe needs an internal energy market and effective
emissions trading
Europe is facing sizable energy sector investments. Production plants must be
refurbished, new plants must be built, and electricity transmission connections
between countries must be added. W e also need smart grids to meet the growing
needs of society and the changing markets.
Energy sector investments are made for decades down the road, and that
requires a stable energy policy . An ambitious emissions reduction target would
send a very positive signal to the CO 2markets and thus strengthen the long-term
operating environment and increase predictability; it also would be an incentive
for investments in low-carbon energy production. An alternative to emissions
trading would mainly be national carbon taxes, which would further undermine the
effectiveness of the internal market and would lead to tax competition between
member states.
Strongly fluctuating renewable energy production and its privileged access to the
grid has caused even negative market prices for electricity . This undermines the
competitiveness of conventional electricity production. In the worst-case scenario,
it leads to a situation in which both renewable energy production and the existing,
fossil fuel-based capacity are subsidised. For this reason, many countries have
adopted or are planning to adopt the so-called capacity payment mechanism to
offset the impacts of national renewable energy subsidies. Capacity payments
aim to ensure that a supply of electricity would be available also when solar and
wind power cannot be produced.
The energy sector's future cannot be built on national solutions nor on public
funding and subsidies. Market-driven solutions must be sought out from the EU's
internal energy market, and we must advance resolutely towards Europe's energy
and climate policy targets. The internal energy market and harmonised renewable
energy steering mechanisms would bring significant savings in the EU compared
to national measures.
A reasonably good year in a challenging environment
Fortum performed reasonably well in 2012, even though the operating
environment was challenging and the demand for electricity didn't pick up.
Electricity prices in the Nordic countries were one third lower than in the previous
year, partially as a result of the exceptionally high precipitation levels. However ,

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/through successful hedging, Fortum was able to achieve a satisfactory price level
for electricity .
Earnings in 2012 were satisfactory at 1.59 euros per share. The per-share impact
of Sweden's corporate tax rate reduction was 0.22 euros. Our goal is to maintain
stability in the comparable net debt/EBITDA ratio also in the current operating
environment. Last year , the amount of debt grew slightly higher than the target
level, mainly due to our ongoing investment projects.
Because of these financial challenges and uncertainties related to the operating
environment, in autumn we launched a two-year efficiency programme . Its goal is
to lighten the cost structure, improve competitiveness, and strengthen the
operating prerequisites based on our strategy . The programme has been
integrated into the business planning and is progressing as expected. W e saw the
first impacts of the ef ficiency programme already in the fourth-quarter financial
performance.
CO 2-free electricity for Nordic markets
The significantly lower electricity price level in the Nordic countries was of fset by
our record-high hydropower production, over 25 terawatt-hours (TWh). CO 2-free
hydropower is Fortum's strength, and it accounted for about one third of our
production. As the share of renewable energy in the markets grows, there is
greater fluctuation in the electricity supply , and thus the importance of flexible,
balancing hydropower production grows.
The availability of our nuclear power , meanwhile, was clearly short of
expectations in 2012. Nuclear power accounted for nearly one third of our
production. In particular , the long maintenance outage of the number one unit of
the co-owned Oskarshamn nuclear plant in Sweden was disappointing. The
outage caused Fortum an extra burden of about 50 million euros in the form of
lost production. In 2013, we will transfer more of Fortum's nuclear power
technology know-how for use also at our co-owned power plants.
In terms of availability and safety , Fortum's Loviisa nuclear power plant has
traditionally ranked among the world's best. However , availability fell short of the
previous year's level, due to the number one unit's extended maintenance outage
(performed every eight years) and to three production outages. Continuous
improvement of availability and safety are among our goals also this year , and we
are investing in the construction of multiple back-up systems for cooling. The
continuous improvement of safety is a prerequisite for nuclear power availability .
Fortum also has a 25-per cent stake in T eollisuuden V oima Oyj's (TVO) third
nuclear power unit under construction. The Olkiluoto 3 project has proven to be
challenging and has been pushed even further from its original timetable.
Demand for our special expertise in nuclear power
In 2012, Fortum made a significant sales agreement on the delivery of the
Fortum-developed Nures ion exchange material to Fukushima, Japan. Using the
material makes it possible to decrease the amount of radioactive liquids to a
fraction of its former volume. Fortum's 2012 Innovation A ward was given for the

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/development of the Nures material . The innovation is a good demonstration of our
special expertise, which creates value for the surrounding community and drives
energy-sector development forward.
Combined heat and power (CHP) production brings
resource efficiency
In addition to hydro and nuclear power , Fortum is one of the world's biggest heat
producers . Incombined heat and power production , close to 90 per cent of the
fuel's energy is utilised. W e use a diverse range of energy sources flexibly in our
CHP production, and we aim to increase the use of renewable fuels. The use of
biomass and municipal and industrial waste at our European plants replaces
other fuels and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
The cornerstone of the world's first industrial scale bio-oil plant was laid in early
November at the Fortum plant being built in Joensuu, Finland. The plant to be
integrated with the Joensuu CHP plant will be comissioned in autumn this year .
The integrated CHP/bio-oil plant will use biomass to produce electricity and
district heat as well as 50,000 tonnes of bio-oil annually that is suitable for heat
production.
We produce energy at CHP plants and heating plants in seven countries. In
Stockholm, Fortum also has close to 20 years of experience in district cooling
solutions for modern urban living. In Russia, Fortum operates in the developed
industrial areas in the Urals and western Siberia where we are the leading
supplier of district heat in the region.
After the reform of the electricity wholesale market, the modernisation of the heat
sector has also become a focus in Russia. The aim is to increase the investment
interest in that country's heat sector .
Weather-proof electricity distribution to customers
We continued improving the weather-proofing of our electricity distribution
network in 2012, after the 201 1 year-end storms that demonstrated the
vulnerability of electricity distribution in Finland.
We have improved our preparedness for power outage situations in electricity and
heat distribution by deploying text message-based outage notifications for
customers, by improving procedures in exceptional situations, and by training
personnel. The enhanced preparedness was put to the test during a storm last
autumn; our customers experienced minimal disruptions as a result of the storm.
In 2012, the reliability of Fortum's electricity distribution increased to 99.98 per
cent from the previous year's 99.90 per cent.
More customers and higher satisfaction
Last year , our customers gave Fortum a more favourable rating in the survey
measuring the satisfaction of electricity sales and distribution customers in
Finland, Sweden and Norway . In Sweden and Norway , we achieved our all-time
best result. In Finland , customer satisfaction decreased slightly as a result of the

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/storms in late 201 1. The long-term customer satisfaction trend has developed
favourably in all three of these countries of operation.
The number of Fortum electricity customers increased in 2012. W e now have
more customers in Finland than ever before. I believe that new products, like
solar panels and energy ef ficiency services, contributed significantly to our
success. W e will continue developing solutions that enable our customers to also
sell electricity and heat back to Fortum as well as other new products that enable
our customers to actively influence their energy consumption if so desired.
Sustainability targets renewed
Sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy . Our goal is to advance in all
sub-areas of sustainability . We are also committed to compliance with the
principles of UN Global Compact initiative.
The good hydrological year enabled us to achieve our climate targets in 2012,
and the share of CO 2-free electricity production grew from the previous year . In
terms of energy ef ficiency , we fell slightly short of our target. W e will continue our
efforts to improve plant availability , energy ef ficiency and fuel quality , among other
things. In Russia, where we have focused our operations in oil and natural gas
production areas, our emissions have increased with the growth in the volume of
operations.
The renewed sustainability targets came into force at the beginning of 2013. W e
emphasise Fortum's role in society and measure not only environmental targets,
but also the company's reputation, customer satisfaction, and the security of
power and heat supply .
Occupational safety must be improved every day
In terms of occupational safety development, I am both pleased and
disappointed. The safety of our own personnel improved further , and the accident
frequency decreased to an all-time low . Contractor safety development,
meanwhile, didn't progress in the right direction: a fatal accident occurred in
Russia and several serious accidents also happened during the year . I extend my
sincere condolences to the family and co-workers of the victim.
To prevent serious accidents and also to reduce the number of less serious
accidents, we will continue our determined ef forts to improve occupational safety .
The attitude of continuous improvement must be part of the daily routines of every
Fortum employee and contractor .
The ISO 14001 environmental certification and OHSAS 18001 certification for
occupational health and safety received by our subsidiary OAO Fortum's
operations reflect a favourable trend.

implementation
In 2012, we measured employee satisfaction by conducting the Fortum Sound
survey . The results indicate a clearly stronger level of employee engagement
compared to the previous survey three years ago. According to the survey , our
strengths include teamwork, the possibility to influence the content of one's own
work, and fair treatment of personnel. The survey was conducted in all of our
countries of operation.
The Code of Conduct guiding the ethical activities of all Fortum employees was
updated last year . By the end of February 2013, 99 per cent of the personnel had
completed training related to the Code of Conduct.
A strong commitment to growth
Fortum's purpose is to create energy that improves life for present and future
generations. Alongside emissions-free hydro and nuclear power and combined
heat and power production, we are developing the use of biofuels and exploring
solar , wind and wave energy opportunities. These are all part of the future energy
system, which in the long-term will transition to solutions that are based on solar
energy .
In 2013, we will commission the Järvenpää biopower plant in Finland, the Jelgava
biopower plant in Latvia, and new , waste-fired power plants in Brista, Sweden,
and Klaipeda, Lithuania. All four plants are energy-ef ficient, combined heat and
power plants that reduce CO 2emissions and increase the use of local fuels. In
the latter part of 2012, we made an investment decision to build a biofuelled CHP
plant in Stockholm. The plant will be commissioned in 2016.
Our goal is to complete the extensive Russian investment programme by the end
of 2014. In addition to the three plants already completed, next we will
commission three 400+ megawatt (MW) power plants in Nyagan within the
original overall timetable; that will be followed by two almost 250-MW power
plants in Chelyabinsk.
The Russian electricity market reform has been realised as promised by the
country's government, and the overall market outlook there is more positive than
in Europe.
We are pursuing growth in our current markets as well as in the integrating
European and rapidly growing Asian markets. In France, we are continuing
preparations for the upcoming hydropower concessions tender process.
Succeeding in the tender process would give us an opportunity to grow the CO 2-
free hydropower capacity . In India, we are exploring opportunities for CHP
production for industry as well as solar power production.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/We are assessing the future alternatives of the
electricity distribution business
We initiated a project in the beginning of this year to assess the future alternatives
of the electricity distribution business. Divestment is also among the alternatives
being assessed.
Electricity distribution is a regulated business that yields a stable return. However ,
the distribution business would hold better value potential in a dif ferent kind of
business structure, which would enable a bigger share of liabilities. The
assessment is also impacted by the legislature's long-term goal to separate
electricity distribution from electricity production and sales into a clearly detached,
independent infrastructure business.
The results of the assessment will be available by the end of this year . We
decided to communicate the issue already in the early phase of the assessment
so that we can openly assess all alternatives and discuss them both internally
and externally and to have a dialogue about the needs and views of the
surrounding society .
Assessing the electricity distribution business alternatives does not af fect our
customers. W e will also continue building a weather-proof grid, as planned. W e
are developing new products for electricity sales customers, and we intend to
take the development of electricity market products forward as an industry
frontrunner .
A strong platform for advancement
We will continue implementing our strategy in 2013. As a result of investment
decisions made in recent years, we will commission a significant amount of new
capacity this year . We are developing future energy production forms, like solar
and wave energy , in addition to emissions-free hydropower and nuclear power ,
and CHP production. Also our ef ficiency programme is advancing and improves
Fortum's preparedness to respond to opportunities af forded by the changing
energy markets.
I want to thank Fortum employees in all of our countries of operation for the past
year and for the ef fort put forth to achieve common goals. A thank you also goes
to our shareholders for their investments – we will continue the work to grow
shareholder value also this year .

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Future energy system
Fortum believes that the future energy system will be based on
emissions-free and inexhaustible energy sources and on overall
efficiency of the energy system.
In the future energy system – in a Solar Economy – energy from the sun will be
used either directly as solar electricity and heat or indirectly as hydro, ocean, wind
and bioenergy . On the journey towards a Solar Economy , traditional production
forms will be further developed and used alongside solar-based production. In a
Solar Economy , the energy system is more dynamic and smarter , enabling both
centralised and distributed electricity production – through the active participation of
electricity users.
Energy system changes slowly
In the capital-intensive energy industry , investments can’t be realised without a
stable and predictable operating environment. Changes in the energy system are
slow, and transitioning from the current energy system to a Solar Economy requires
technology advancements as well as changes in the energy markets, the political
operating environment, society’ s infrastructure and consumption habits over the
course of several decades. Development of the operating environment is necessary
for the investments required for a change in the energy system, while the length of
the transition period and the cost are dependent on political decisions, society’ s
priorities and technology advancements in production forms.
Fortum researches future energy forms
Fortum wants to promote both short- and long-term development of the energy
system simultaneously . However , the current emission-free energy sources are not
yet able to fulfil the energy demand of the modern and developing society; that is
why in the short term we are continuing to widely utilise also traditional energy
forms, and our goal is to do so even more ef ficiently .
Fortum is researching and developing new energy forms that in the longer term
could of fer significant business opportunities. In our R&D activities, we are focusing
primarily on development activities that of fer Fortum opportunities for growth and at
the same time reduce emissions. Examples include solar and wave power , new
CHP concepts, and new solutions for customers.
Our energy
production in Europe
is based mainly on
CO 2-free energy
sources. In Russia
our production relies
onfossil fuels.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Fortum's current energy production portfolio is still far from emissions-free energy
future. Our production mix is twofold: in Europe strongly focusing on CO 2-free
energy sources and in Russia based on fossil energy sources. The existing capacity
will be used for decades and consequently we are bound to the related emissions
far in the future.
Our production in Europe is mainly CO 2-
free
In Europe, Fortum’ s energy production is based mainly on CO 2-free energy sources:
hydro and nuclear power for electricity production and, to a large extent, biomass
and waste-derived fuels for heat production. V irtually all of the new capacity to be
commissioned in 2013 is CO 2-free. The investment decision made at the end of
2012 to build a new biomass-fired CHP plant in Värtan, Stockholm, and the pyrolysis
plant under construction and to be integrated with the Joensuu power plant will
increase our use of emissions-free energy sources.
In Russia fossil energy sources dominate
In Fortum’ s operating areas, the use of fossil fuels is likely to continue far into the
future and along with the commissioning of the new production capacity our total
emissions will increase.
In Russia, the legislative and political environment related to climate change
mitigation differs significantly from that of Europe’ s. Russia has not committed to the
second period of the Kyoto Protocol, and emissions have no commercial value in
the country . Extensive development and profitability of low-carbon energy forms in
Russia requires a change in the operating environment.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Due to the dif ferences in the prices and availability of fuels, coal will account for a
growing share of the fuels used in our Russian plants in the upcoming years. At the
same time, we aim to use coal with a better quality and thereby reduce local
environmental impacts.
In the longer term, possible changes in legislation and targets to limit carbon dioxide
emissions can improve the competitiveness of renewable energy forms and promote
the use of CO 2-free energy sources. Eventually , this could lead to the opportunity to
use a more diverse mix of fuels, e.g. bio- and waste-derived fuels, at our Russian
production plants.
Focus on energy efficiency in Russia
Since a significant reduction in CO 2emissions is not possible with Fortum’ s
current production capacity and fuel portfolio, Fortum aims to reduce emissions by
improving energy ef ficiency . Energy ef ficiency can be improved when building new
power plants to replace old, less ef ficient power plants and when refurbishing
existing plants. Renewing district heat networks and improving the ef ficiency of heat
distribution also have a key role in improving energy ef ficiency .
Our investment programme’ s new plants are mainly based on combined-cycle gas
turbine (CCGT) technology , which represents best available techniques in natural
gas combustion. This type of plant generates electricity with gas and steam turbines,
and its ef ficiency in combined heat and power production is about 80-85%.
However , some of the investment programme’ s plants, like Nyagan’ s three units
(3*418 MW), are plants producing only electricity because of their geographical
location, so their overall ef ficiency of fuel use is lower . In the vicinity of the plant
there are no customers who could utilise the heat. Condensing power plants do not
improve Fortum’ s total ef ficiency of energy use, nor do they reduce specific CO 2
emissions of our energy production in Russia.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Core areas of the strategy
The core of our strategy is our strong expertise in CO 2-free hydro
and nuclear power and in efficient combined heat and
power production.
Our strengths also include our solid experience in operating in the energy
markets. Our business focus areas will continue to be developed through these
competencies.
Build on the strong Nordic core
Hydro and nuclear power are CO 2-free production forms. They are also
competitive in terms of variable costs. Hydro and nuclear power have a significant
role in Fortum's production portfolio: In 2012 about 90% of Fortum's European
electricity production was based on hydro and nuclear power located in the
Nordic countries. Hydropower is particularly valuable in the integrating European
energy market, where it can be used to balance out consumption peaks and the
production fluctuations of wind and solar power .
Combined heat and power (CHP) production has a central role in our business
throughout the Baltic region. Electricity produced in conjunction with district heat
enables the use of bio- and waste fuels and also a more energy-ef ficient way to
use traditional fossil fuels.
At the end of January 2013, Fortum decided that the company will assess the
strategic position of its electricity distribution business. Fortum expects to
conclude the assessment during 2013. Fortum has electricity distribution
business in Finland, Sweden and Norway . The assessment has no impact on
Fortum's electricity distiribution customers and excludes the company's electricity
retail business.
Create solid earnings growth in Russia
Russia is the fourth biggest consumer of electricity globally and the growth of its
electricity demand is outpacing that of the EU's. Fortum's investment programme
is bringing new energy-ef ficient production units on stream; these will significantly
grow the share of sales and profits that Fortum earns from its Russian operations.
Completing the investment programme is a key priority for us.
Combined heat and
power production has
a central role in our
business.

Global economic growth slowed in 2012 and Europe’ s economic
situation was weak; development in Russia was steadier . The
integration development of Europe’ s energy markets regressed due to
the strengthening of national interests.
European power generators have committed to a challenging target to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions, but the uncertainty of the regulatory environment is
hampering progress in the desired direction.
In 2012, instead of European energy market integration, the strengthening of
national interests led to an increase in subsidy systems, unforeseeable changes and
overlapping cumulative ef fects that are inconsistent with the European energy and
climate policy . At the same time, the oversupply of emission allowances and low
prices undermine the functioning of the emissions trading system. In fact, an
investment survey of European electricity companies indicates that the increase of
political risk is considered the biggest obstacle to investments.
Renewable energy
production is largely
based on political
decisions and
financial subsidies.

As populations grow and economies develop, generally also their energy demand increases. The energy
sector has a key role in ensuring that growth is sustainable. Fortum aims to meet the global challenges with
its long-term strategy based on its solid energy expertise.
The rising af fluence of the population and improvements in energy ef ficiency have increased the share of electricity in energy
consumption. With electricity , it is possible to promote the beneficial use of natural resources and economic sustainability .
Globalisation
With globalisation the world’ s
economies are becoming more
dependent on each other and
business cycles rarely occur on
just a local level. The general
development of the global
economy has an impact on the
energy sector through e.g.,
financial markets, fuel price
development, localisation of
industries and electricity
demand.
New consumer
aspirations
Urbanisation and the rise in
living standards, particularly in
the big growth centres of Asia,
are changing consumer habits
and increasing energy
consumption. The growing
environmental awareness of
consumers in Europe is
motivating energy companies to
make their operations and
service offering more eco-
friendly .
Growing relative role of
electricity
Diminishing natural resources,
growing environmental
problems and the rising prices
of fuels are increasing
electricity’ s relative share of
total energy consumption. W ith
electricity replacing other
energy use, the total energy
need decreases as the use of
electricity is more efficient. This
combined with CO 2-free
electricity , produced with
renewable energy sources or
the nuclear power , will also
result in decreased emissions.

The liberalisation of the
electricity markets and market
integration are examples of the
changes countries are making in
an effort to boost efficiency in
energy production and market
functioning. These changes also
attract investments in new and
replacement capacity .
Resource scarcity and
energy shortage
Growth in the global population
and the rapid growth in energy
demand in emerging economies
impose huge challenges on the
sufficiency of natural resources
and energy supply . It is
estimated that the global
population is currently
consuming one fourth more of
the earth’ s resources than is
sustainable. W ith the current
development, the resource
deficit deepens even further .
New economic powers
The focus of the global
economy is shifting from the

driven by China and India. China
has already taken its place as
the world’ s second largest
economy , and it is expected to

Investments in the energy sector are made decades ahead, so a
predictable policy is important. However , in economically uncertain
times governments have a growing desire to increase tax revenues,
which contributes to the increased uncertainty in the energy sector ’s
operating environment.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Commission,
major energy investments will be needed in Europe in the upcoming 20 years. Close
to a trillion, i.e. one thousand billion, euros will be needed by 2020 for investments in
electricity production, transmission, distribution and storage, and investments of
three trillion before 2030. According to a recent survey conducted by Eurelectric, the
European electricity sector association representing the common interests of the
electricity industry at the pan-European level, 45 out of 46 CEOs of European
electricity companies estimated that only half of these necessary investments will be
realised.
The same survey indicates that energy-sector leaders consider poorly predictable
policy to be the main reason for the weak investment conditions. Other reasons are
high capital expenses and low prices for carbon dioxide allowances, which do not
adequately steer upcoming investments. The higher debt burden also impacts the
willingness to invest.
The energy sector ’s growing policy risk is manifested in unpredictable market
interventions that contradict the common energy and climate policy goals. An
example of this at the national level is taxes that hamper investments in existing and
new power plants – like the Finnish Government Programme’ s planned windfall tax
targeting existing emissions-free hydropower and nuclear power plants. T axation on
hydropower and nuclear power was also raised in Sweden. Additionally , both
countries restrict corporate interest deduction rights on internal financing; this
particularly impacts unbundled and capital-intensive energy companies. Fortum calls
for tax harmonisation with other policy objectives to improve predictability . National-
level mechanisms also hamper the development of the EU’ s internal energy
markets.

Nordic electricity markets
Electricity market operations include electricity production, transmission and
distribution, and electricity sales. Electricity production and sales are competitive
businesses, while transmission and distribution are regulated.
The Nordic countries were the first to establish a regional, multi-national electricity
wholesale market. About three quarters of the electricity produced in the Nordic
countries is traded on the Nordic electricity exchange (Nord Pool Spot). The
producers use the rest of the electricity themselves or sell it directly to big industrial
customers.
Close to a trillion
euros will be needed
by 2020 for
investments in
electricity production,
transmission,
distribution and
storage.

hydrological situation af fect the wholesale price. Buyers and sellers alike can hedge
their electricity wholesale and purchase prices with derivative contracts.
Electricity transmission and distribution companies operate regionally because it is
not cost-ef ficient to build multiple electricity networks in the same area. Authorities
monitor electricity transmission and distribution, its costs and the business practices
of the companies engaged in this business. The transmission and distribution
companies must treat all electricity producers and buyers equally , regardless of the
producer or buyer of the electricity they are transmitting.
Electricity retailers buy their electricity mainly from the Nord Pool Spot and sell it to
households and companies. The wholesale price of electricity has the biggest
impact on the retail price. T axes and other fees by authorities (including renewable
energy subsidies) also impact the price.

Europe
A step forward was taken in 2012 in the implementation of the EU’ s energy market
legislation and technical market codes. At the same time, the ramifications of
previous policy decisions, such as the rapid growth in the share of intermittent
renewable energy , started to make a clearer impact. Subsidising renewable energy
has decreased the profitability of market-based and flexible reserve capacity in
several countries. Some member states have planned capacity mechanisms to
maintain reserve capacity on the markets. Without clear coordination at the EU
level, in the worst-case scenario, they could crumble the current market model that
is based on the price of electricity .
In November , the European Commission published a report about the development
of Europe’ s internal energy markets. The report urges member states to make
adequate investments in cross-border electricity transmission in order to improve
resource ef ficiency and security of supply . The Commission sees the possible
capacity mechanisms as a secondary alternative and, if adopted, the Commission
supports the development of a pan-European practice. Fortum is of the opinion that
the Commission should, in fact, define clear criteria for the use of possible national
capacity mechanisms.
Energy market development in Russia
Discussions on renewing both power and heat markets have started
in Russia.
Russia’ s Energy Minister has initiated a dialogue about the structure of future
electricity markets and has proposed a new market model that would be applied
starting in 2014. Regulatory authorities have been concerned that the capacity
markets in their current form do not encourage ef ficiency improvements of old
power plants or new investments beyond the long-term capacity
supply agreements. The current system is considered expensive for end users.
Enforcement of the legislation on heat production, which took ef fect at the
beginning of 201 1, is continuing in Russia. Meanwhile, there has been progress in
the elimination of cross-subsidies between electricity and heat as well as
residential and big industrial customers. The country also has taken into use long-
term heat tarif f models, but, like the legislation on heat production, implementation
remains unfinished. Modernisation of the heat sector in Russia is important,
because it would be very dif ficult to achieve the energy-ef ficiency targets set for
the country without it.

Liberalisation of the Russian wholesale electricity market was completed by the
beginning of 201 1. However , all generating companies continue to sell a part of
their electricity and capacity – an amount equalling the consumption of
households and a special group of consumers – under regulated prices.
Households account for about 10% of the wholesale markets.
In addition to the wholesale electricity market, Russia also has an electricity
capacity market, in which an electricity producer receives earnings for the
production capacity it of fers for market use. The purpose of the electricity capacity
market is mainly to encourage new investments in electricity production.
The long-term capacity market rules were approved by the Russian Government
in 2010 and have been applied from the beginning of 201 1. The so-called old
capacity , built before 2007, will compete in competitive capacity selection. The
first competitive capacity selection in accordance with the new rules of the long-
term capacity market was held in December 2010. The new generation capacity ,
built after 2007 under government Capacity Supply Agreements (CSA), will
receive guaranteed payments for a period of 10 years. Prices for capacity under
CSA are defined to ensure a suf ficient return on investments.

In spite of the precarious macroeconomic situation, the share of
electricity in total energy consumption continues to grow . In the Nordic
countries, demand for electricity recovered slightly from
2011.Industrial demand remained relatively stable, but private
consumption continued to grow . In Russia, too, consumption grew
slightly .
Electricity consumption in the Nordic countries in 2012 was 391 terawatt-hours
(TWh) (201 1: 384), i.e. about 2% more than the previous year . Precipitation in the
region was abundant in 2012 and water reservoir levels remained historically high
until the end of November . The record-setting hydrological situation resulted in a
drop in the Nordic electricity prices.
In 2012, the average system price of electricity in Nord Pool Spot decreased by one
third and was EUR 31.2/megawatt-hour (MWh) (201 1: 47.1). Electricity prices in the
Nordic countries were lower than in Continental Europe, and therefore electricity
was exported almost continuously from the Nordic countries to Continental Europe.
In Germany , the average spot price in 2012 was EUR 42.6/MWh (201 1: 51.1).
Area price dif ferences in the Nordic wholesale electricity markets were considerable,
due to electricity transmission bottlenecks caused by numerous cable problems.
Area prices in 2012 were significantly higher than Nordic system prices, particularly
in Finland, but also in Sweden. Additionally , during 2012, the Finnish area price was
impacted by lower imports from Russia compared to the year before.
The year ’s average area price in Finland (FI) was EUR 36.6/MWh (201 1: 49.3).
Sweden was divided into four price areas in the second half of 201 1. The average
area price in Stockholm (SE3) was EUR 32.3/MWh (201 1: 47.9) and in Sundsval
(SE2) EUR 31.8/MWh.
At the beginning of 2012, the market price for CO 2emission allowances (EUA) was
about EUR 6.6/tonne. During the year , CO 2emission allowances traded at about
EUR 5.7−9.5/ tonne, and at year-end the rate was about EUR 6.7/tonne.
Slight rise in electricity price in Russia
In 2012, electricity consumption in Russia was 1,037 TWh (201 1: 1,020). The
corresponding figure in Fortum’ s operating area, in the First price zone (European
part of Russia and the Urals), was 769 TWh (201 1: 760).
In Russia, the electricity spot price, excluding capacity price, increased in 2012 by
1% to RUB 1,001/MWh (201 1: 990) in the First price zone. The increase in the spot
price was af fected by the Russian Government’ s decision to raise natural gas prices
as of 1 July 2012: the increase was about 15%. The spot price development,
however , was under pressure in the beginning of the year due to restrictions in the
pre-election period. The abundant nuclear and hydropower production combined
with somewhat lower demand pressed prices later in the year .

In 2012, negotiations on the UN’ s new climate agreement continued
at a slow pace. The development of a roadmap to a low-carbon
economy continued in the EU. Meanwhile, the oversupply of
emission allowances and low prices undermined the functionality of
the emissions trading system.
International negotiations on the UN’ s new climate agreement continued in 2012.
A step forward, however a modest one, was achieved in the negotiations at 18th
Conference of the Parties (COP18), held in Doha, Qatar , in the latter part of 2012.
The Kyoto Protocol will continue in 2013-2020 and a programme was drafted to
work on a global climate agreement by 2015. As such, the agreement would take
effect in 2020.
For the next four years, the United States is likely to have a cautious approach
towards global climate negotiations and development of a national emissions
trading system. The United States’ commitment to a universal agreement is
largely dependent on whether China and India will approve the absolute
emissions reduction targets. However , there are regional trading schemes under
development in the United States, as well as on other continents. In 2012, the EU
and Australia agreed on the linking of their emissions trading schemes: the aim is
to link the schemes partially in 2015 and fully in 2018.

In Europe, the dialogue continued about the four roadmaps presented by the
Commission in 201 1. The purpose of these roadmaps is to advance towards a
low-carbon economy by 2050. The dialogue focused on setting emission
reduction targets for the post-2020 period. The biggest reduction needs are
focused on the energy sector , which should be practically carbon-free by 2050.
It is important to gain certainty about the climate policy and the post-2020 targets
as soon as possible. The EU must at the first opportunity set an ambitious carbon
dioxide emissions target for 2030. However , overlapping targets for example for
renewable energy should not be set for beyond 2020. Additionally , national
subsidies for renewable energy sources must be gradually phased out.
Need of restructuring the EU's emissions
trading scheme
Several national subsidy mechanisms for renewable energy have displaced the
role of emissions trading and have thus hampered the development of market-
driven solutions and the common market. The role of the EU’ s emissions trading
system (ETS) as a promoter of a low-carbon energy future was called into
question more loudly in 2012. The ETS has been overshadowed by the
weakened economy and national policies and measures. Additionally , the
oversupply of emission allowances and the more volatile and lower than expected
prices have undermined the system. This is due to the slowdown in economic
growth and overlapping steering mechanisms e.g. in renewable energy and
energy ef ficiency .
In 2012, the Commission proposed changes to the timing of auctions of emission
allowances and structural changes of the scheme. The purpose is to postpone
the auctioning of 900 million emission allowances from the first years of the
period 2013-2020 towards the end of the period (back-loading). Alternatives to
the structural reform include e.g. increasing the reduction target for emissions for
2020, tightening the annual linear emissions reduction factor , and expanding the
ETS to new sectors. Decisions on timing of auctions will be made in 2013.
It is important to maintain the emissions trading system as the primary climate
instrument. In addition to the system’ s long-term structural reform, also short-term
changes are needed. After postponing the timing of the allowance auctions,
emissions allowances should be permanently withdrawn (set-aside).

Research and development supporting
business
The purpose of Fortum's research and development is to improve
competitiveness and to create a foundation for new , profitable
business. W e assess each new development project against the
criteria of business potential, carbon dioxide emissions reduction
and resource ef ficiency .
Research and development (R&D) activities help Fortum to develop a
sustainable, carbon dioxide-free future. Its focus areas are continuous
improvement of current operations, enabling of growth opportunities and
development of an emissions-free energy system in the long-term.
The main areas of R&D activities are:
•The advanced technologies included in Fortum's existing energy
system. In this area, nuclear power is our most important research
area. In addition, we are also developing integrated combined heat and
power systems, i.e. CHP+ plants.
•New technologies and solutions supporting development of the energy
system towards the future solar economy . Targets of development in
this area include solar and ocean energy as well as sustainable urban
solutions.
Fortum's total R&D expenditure in 2012 was EUR 41 million (201 1: 38), which
corresponds to 0.7% of sales (201 1: 0.6%).

research
In 2012, Fortum's nuclear R&D activities focused on the research for the safe final
disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Safety and availability of nuclear power plants
were developed by concentrating on, among other things, to the aging
management of nuclear power plants and the concrete structures.
In addition to improving safety , Fortum's nuclear power research focuses on
maintaining and developing the expertise in existing and potential new nuclear
power technologies. For example, ion exchange materials developed through
Fortum's long-term research were delivered to the damaged Daiichi power plant
in Fukushima , Japan, to decontaminate the radioactive water .
New combined heat and electricity
solutions
In 2012, Fortum made a decision to build a bio-oil plant based on fast pyrolysis
technology in Joensuu, Finland. The bio-oil plant , globally the first of its kind on
an industrial scale, will be integrated with the existing combined heat and power
plant.
Additionally , the production and use of biocoal as well as bioethanol production
processes were researched, and the use of power plant flue gases in algae
cultivation was tested. Fortum also participated in CLEEN Ltd.'s carbon capture
and storage (CCS) programme, which focused on CHP plant solutions and future
innovations in the sector .
Wave and solar energy and sustainable
urban living
Wave energy-related research and development continued in 2012. W e continued
collaboration on the development of wave energy technology with A W-Energy Oy .
Additionally , we started construction of a wave power park in Sotenäs, Sweden,
together with Seabased AB. After completion, the wave power park will be the
world's biggest full-scale demonstration project. In France, we continued wave
power research and development work with DCNS. In 2012, Fortum started
business development related to solar energy .
In 2012, we also continued the research on sustainable urban solutions and the
development of services for customers. For example, development of the smart
grid for the Royal Seaport project in Stockholm advanced to the implementation
phase. W e participated in a new research programme on ef ficient energy use

Fortum’ s actions to reduce impacts in 2012
1.The origin and sustainability of fuels was the target of increased focus in purchasing. W e assess the level of operations of
our fuel suppliers through e.g. pre-selection and supplier audits: we performed a total of 264 pre-selections of all suppliers
and audited ten of them.
2.Fortum became a member of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and continued an active dialogue within the
framework of the WWF Global Forest & T rade Network and the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil organisation.
3.Fortum joined the Bettercoal initiative to promote the principles of sustainable development in coal mining. Bettercoal’ s
Code of Conduct-related stakeholder event was held in Russia in November .
4.Fortum’ s experts assessed the fuel supplier ’s uranium mine operations in Russia. Fortum regularly assesses the quality ,
environmental, and health and safety management systems of its nuclear fuel suppliers and the manufacturing of nuclear
fuel assemblies.
5.Of Fortum’ s purchases, fuels accounted for about EUR 1,057 million, of which the share of fossil fuels was about EUR
910 million and biofuels about EUR 130 million.
6.Fortum used 6.1 terawatt-hours of biomass and other biofuels in energy production, and increasing the use of bioenergy
was researched at several of our power plants.
7.Fortum used over 800,000 tonnes of waste-derived fuels in Sweden and Finland, accounting for 1.8% of the energy
content of total fuel use. The use of waste-derived fuels reduces the use of natural resources.
8.Fortum reports the greenhouse gas emissions from the fuel chain, including indirect emissions from the production and

Fortum’ s actions to reduce impacts in 2012
1.68% of Fortum’ s electricity production was carbon dioxide-free, an increase of 3 percentage points from the previous year .
2.Refurbishments of hydropower plants and dams and voluntary activities to mitigate the impacts of hydropower production
continued. Fortum started a sizable power plant dam refurbishment project in Höljes, Sweden. A multi-year refurbishment
project was launched at the Pyhäkoski power plant in Finland. In Sweden, the Gammelänge and Långå hydropower
plants were refurbished. The hydropower refurbishment projects implemented during the year resulted in 9.5 MW of
additional capacity , and an annual hydropower production increase of about 9.1 GWh.
3.To offset hydropower production’ s environmental impacts on the fishing industry , Fortum restocked about 1.2 million fish
fry in Sweden and Finland.
4.The approximately 15,000-cubic-meter expansion of the Loviisa nuclear power plant’ s final repository for low- and
intermediate-level radioactive waste was commissioned in the latter part of the year .
5.At the end of the year , the Fortum and T eollisuuden V oima Oyj jointly owned Posiva Oy submitted a construction licence
application for a final repository for spent nuclear fuel to the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority .
6.CHP production accounted for 32% of our electricity production and 79% of our heat production. New biomass- and
waste-fired CHP plants were under construction in Klaipeda, Lithuania; Jelgava, Latvia; Brista, Sweden; and Järvenpää,
Finland.

Other environmental aspects
•Building and maintenance of overhead power lines impacts the environment, land use and the visual landscape.
•Underground cables improve the reliability of electricity distribution and reduce environmental impacts.
•The construction of district heat networks causes temporary disruptions locally , but the operation of the network does not
have any major known impacts on the environment.
Society
•Overhead power lines are more vulnerable to weather conditions like storms.
•Power outages have a substantial impact on modern society , which is dependent on electricity .
•Disruptions in heat delivery cause adversities for heat consumers.
Fortum’ s actions to reduce impacts in 2012
1.Distribution business area invested a total of EUR 324 million, the majority of which in smart meters, underground cables,
overhead lines and substations. The System A verage Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) per customer was 103 minutes
in Fortum’ s electricity distribution network.
2.Fortum improved communication during electricity distribution outages by introducing a text messaging service for
customers in the Nordic countries; the service provides information about power outages to electricity distribution
customers. In widespread distribution outages, information is also available through social media channels and Fortum’ s
website. Customer service resources during widespread power outages were also increased.
3.In Finland, Fortum launched the V ahvaV erkko project to improve the reliability of electricity distribution. The goal is to add
about 90,000 Fortum customers to the already 200,000 customers within the sphere of weatherproof distribution by the
end of 2014. By 2020, the goal is to reduce the number of power outages by half and to double the number of customers
within the sphere of weatherproof distribution. In Sweden, implementation of the SäkraNät investment programme
continued.
4.Losses in power distribution were reduced by increasing automatic meter management, optimising network operations,
increasing transmission capacity in the lines with the highest loads and replacing obsolete transformers with new , more
energy-ef ficient ones.
5.In Russia, Fortum continued modernising the district heat networks in Chelyabinsk and T yumen.

Hydropower is the most traditional and significant form of renewable
energy globally . One third of Fortum's annual electricity production is
hydropower .
Carbon dioxide-free and renewable hydropower is one of the most important means
for mitigating climate change and saving scarce natural resources. Hydropower's
energy is derived from the sun, which drives the continuous hydrological cycle.
Regulating power is needed for the
electricity system
In the Nordic electricity market, hydropower is the most important production form in
balancing the production and consumption of electricity . Other renewable energy
forms, like wind and solar power , need hydropower for regulating power .
Hydropower is particularly suitable as the fastest regulating power , because
hydropower plants can be started up or shut down quickly . With water stored in the
reservoirs, production can be shifted to periods when electricity consumption is
highest. Hydropower can also be used to manage sudden disruptions in the power
grid.
One third of Fortum's electricity production
is hydropower
In 2012, Fortum's hydropower production in the Nordic countries was 25.2 terawatt-
hours (TWh), accounting for 34% of its electricity production. The share
fluctuates annually depending on the hydrological situation.
Fortum's hydro power production capacity in the Nordic countries is about 4,600
MW. At year-end 2012, we owned or co-owned 191 hydropower plants in Sweden
and Finland. The plants with the largest capacity are located on the Dalälven,
Indalsälven and Ljusnan rivers in central Sweden and on the Oulujoki, Kemijoki and
Vuoksi rivers in Finland.
In 2012 and early 2013, we divested 100 small hydropower plants in Finland and
Sweden. The capacity of the small hydropower plants sold was a total of 102 MW ,
which corresponds to a total of 2% of Fortum's entire hydropower capacity . We
divested the small hydropower plants so that we can focus our resources on large-
scale hydropower . In 2012, we also continued preparations for the tender processes
for hydropower concessions in France.
In the Nordic
electricity market,

with the launch of a multi-year refurbishment project at the Pyhäkoski power plant in
Finland. In Sweden, the Gammelänge and Långå power plants, among others, were
refurbished. Refurbishments can improve the ef ficiency and safety of hydropower
plants and can reduce environmental risks, thanks to modern, more environmentally
benign technology . The refurbishments implemented in 2012 resulted in 9.5 MW of
added capacity , and an annual hydropower production increase of about 9.1 GWh.

Fortum actively participates in mitigating the impacts of hydropower
and in research related to the impacts of hydropower . As a result of
careful operation, Fortum's hydropower plants had no significant
permit non-compliances in 2012.
The most significant environmental impacts of hydropower are caused by the
construction of plants and dams and dredging of riverbeds. Hydropower can alter
river systems, shorelines, and the routes and natural flow rates of rivers.
Regulating the level of water in lakes and rivers af fects the aquatic habitat as well
as other uses of the water systems.
The permit conditions for Fortum's hydropower plants and lake regulation define
the limits for surface water levels and flow rate variations in the water systems.
The permits also define obligations to prevent and to compensate for
environmental impacts.
There was exceptionally high summer flooding in the Oulujoki water system in
Finland in 2012, but the regulation was in line with the permit also during the flood
situation. The V uoksi water system also had more water than normal, and Fortum
had to resort to numerous spillages.
To compensate for the environmental impacts of hydropower production on the
fish industry , in 2012 Fortum restocked about 260,000 salmon and sea trout
smolts, and 330,000 sea whitefish smolts in Finland. In inland water systems,
restocking of lake trout, pike perch, European grayling and whitefish were
planned based on the wishes of fisheries areas and fisheries collectives. About
520,000 salmon and rainbow trout smolts and 50,000 eels were restocked in
Sweden's water systems.
Voluntary projects within the framework of Fortum's Environmental Fund also
helped to lessen the environmental impacts of hydropower . In Finland, the flood
meadows of Kiantajärvi lake were restored and the rehabilitation of fish habitats in
the V uoksi river was planned. Several projects and research studies to improve
the fish habitat were carried out in Sweden. In Dalarna, two dams were removed
from the Oreälven river tributaries to facilitate the migration of fish. In 2012,
Fortum participated in fish migration research in the Oulujoki water system in
Finland and the Klarälven river in Sweden.
Improving dam safety
Hydropower dam safety is the responsibility of the owner , and the condition of the
dams is monitored in accordance with the safety inspection programmes
approved by the dam authority .
Fortum is continuously improving the safety of its hydropower plant dams. In
Sweden, Fortum started a sizable power plant dam refurbishment project at
Höljes, one of Sweden's largest dams. The project will bring the dam up to current
dam safety requirements.
Fortum restocked
about 1.2 million fry in
Swedish and Finnish
watercourses in 2012
to compensate for the
environmental impacts
of hydropower
production.

mitigating climate change
Nuclear power is used to produce electricity in a climate-benign and
safe manner . Nuclear power has a central role in Fortum's energy
production.
Nuclear power accounted for 13% of the world's and 28% of the EU's electricity
production in 2010. New investments in the sector have advanced slowly ,
particularly in Europe, due to the Fukushima accident and the economic crisis.
While some countries are discontinuing nuclear power , we believe that nuclear
power will maintain its position globally . Carbon dioxide-free nuclear power has an
important role in mitigating climate change. The ef ficiency of nuclear power could
be still improved significantly in the future in combined heat and power
production.
Fortum's nuclear power
In 2012, Fortum's nuclear power production was 23.4 terawatt-hours (TWh), i.e.
32% of the company's electricity production. In Finland, in addition to the Loviisa
power plant, we have a 26.6% share in Olkiluoto's two reactors and a 25% share
in the third reactor under construction. In Sweden, Fortum has a 22% share in
Forsmark's production and a 43% share in Oskarshamn's production. Fortum's
nuclear power production capacity is 3,247 MW .
Availability and safety
In 2012, the load factor describing the availability of our Loviisa nuclear power
plant was 87.4% - good by international standards. However , compared to recent
years, the load factor was lower as a result of extended annual maintenance
(once in eight years) on the Loviisa 1 unit and due to three production stoppages
during the operating period. The Loviisa power plant produced 7.61 TWh of
electricity , which was about 10% of the electricity production in Finland. During
the year the plant recorded three incidents impacting safety (level 1 on the INES
scale used by the International Atomic Energy Agency). The incidents did not
cause any danger to people, the environment or the power plant. According to the
IAEA definition, INES 1-incidents do not pose a risk but do indicate a lack of
safety provisions.
Availability in co-owned plants was good, excluding Oskarshamn 1 and
Oskarshamn 3. The prolonged repairs at Oskarshamn 1 continued, and the plant
was shut down for the entire year .
The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) decided in December to step up
the monitoring of the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant by placing the plant under

Modernisations and capacity upgrades
continued
A decision has been made to modernise the Loviisa power plant's high-pressure
turbines in 2014–2017. The modernisation will increase the plant's nominal output
by a total of 24 MW . The project will help us ensure the reliable electricity
production of the plant units to the end of their operational lifetime.
Projects related to capacity upgrades continued at the Forsmark and
Oskarshamn nuclear power plants. The test run period of Forsmark 2's planned
capacity upgrade was postponed to spring 2013. The test run programme of
Oskarshamn 3's capacity upgrade was completed as planned by the end of 2012.
After the capacity upgrade, Oskarshamn 3 became the world's largest boiling
water reactor with a power output of 1,400 MW . The modernisation and capacity
upgrade project of Oskarshamn 2 focused on the planning of the plant
modifications to be carried out in 2013 and 2015.
TVO completed plant upgrades and further improved the safety of the Olkiluoto
nuclear power plant during 2010-2012. As a result, the power output of both
Olkiluoto 1 and Olkiluoto 2 increased by approximately 20 MW each.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Reducing nuclear power ’s environmental impacts
Under normal conditions, nuclear power production does not have
any health or environmental impacts. Nuclear power's most
significant factors are related to nuclear safety , nuclear waste
management, and the thermal load of cooling waters.
The most significant environmental impact of a nuclear power plant during
operation is the increased water temperature in the immediate vicinity of the plant
as a result of cooling water , when sea water cooling is used. In 2012, the Loviisa
power plant's thermal load into the sea was 15.2 TWh. Based on temperature
measurements, the cooling water has raised the surface water temperature by
1−2 degrees within a 1−2 kilometre radius of the cooling water discharge location.
The thermal load into the sea could be reduced by making the nuclear power
plant a combined heat and power plant. This would increase the power plant's
energy ef ficiency by several tens of per cents. So far , this type of solution has not
been realised in the world on a large scale.
Development of nuclear waste
management
The waste generated during nuclear power plant operation is treated within the
sphere of either conventional (non-radioactive) or radioactive waste management.
As in a normal work environment, conventional waste is generated in e.g. the
transportation of goods and in of fice work, and it is handled by an external waste
management company . Depending on its activity , radioactive waste is sorted into
either low-, intermediate- or high-level radioactive waste. The Loviisa power
plant's low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste is disposed of in a final
repository built in the plant area. The roughly 15,000 cubic meters of expansion to
the final repository were taken into use late in 2012. A handling system for liquid
waste is planned for completion in 2014. High-level radioactive nuclear waste will
be disposed of in the nuclear waste final repository to be constructed in Olkiluoto,
Eurajoki.

In Finland and Sweden, the producers of nuclear waste are
responsible for management and final disposal of the nuclear waste
and for the related costs.
The practical implementation of the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel from the
Loviisa and Olkiluoto nuclear power plants is handled by Posiva Oy , which is co-
owned by Fortum and T eollisuuden V oima Oyj. The spent nuclear fuel will be
placed in Olkiluoto's final repository in Eurajoki. Posiva submitted its construction
licence application for a final repository for spent nuclear fuel to the Ministry of
Employment and the Economy at the end of 2012. Readiness to start the final
repository operations is estimated to be around 2020.
In Sweden, Svensk Kärnbränslehantering AB (SKB) handles the final disposal of
the existing plants' spent nuclear fuel. In March 201 1, the company submitted an
application for a construction licence for an encapsulation and final disposal
facility; the application is under review by the authorities. The final repository is
planned to be in Forsmark.
Developing nuclear safety
Developing nuclear power safety is based on continuous improvement
of technology and operations. Nuclear safety is an essential part of
Fortum's research and development activities, accounting for over half
of the company's R&D expenditure.
Nuclear safety and preparedness for extreme external events, in particular , were
actively discussed after the Fukushima accident in 201 1. Consequently , the
European Union launched nuclear power safety assessments, the so-called stress
tests; in addition to these, national safety assessments have also been carried
out.In October 2012, the European Commission published its final report on the
nuclear stress tests. According to the safety assessments , the design basis for
Fortum's nuclear power plants in Finland and Sweden are proper in terms of
external events.
In December 2012, the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) in
Finland submitted in its national action plan to the European Nuclear Safety
Regulators Group (ENSREG). The actions planned at the Loviisa power plant can
be implemented within the framework of the annual maintenance programmes. The
most important development measures are related to the planning of air-
cooled cooling towers that are independent of sea water and improved flood
protection in case of the very improbable exceptionally high sea water level.

improvement plans to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority . The authority will
require the plants to have e.g. independent emergency feed water systems and
stronger focus on analysing the aging of the plants.
Continuous improvement of nuclear safety
We are developing the safety of our nuclear power plants in line with a principle of
continuous improvement. In 2012, the Loviisa power plant's technical safety
enhancements included, e.g., replacement of the Loviisa 1 unit's discharge valve,
renewal of the pressurised spray system, and sluice gate modification of the
seawater systems reducing the risk of flooding.
The goal of Fortum's R&D related to nuclear power is to ensure first-rate nuclear
safety and nuclear waste management as well as good ef ficiency of fuel use. In
addition to its own research programmes, Fortum participates in Finnish national
research programmes and in the development of Swedish nuclear power research.
Independent nuclear safety assessment
It has become an increasingly common practice internationally for nuclear power
companies to have their own independent nuclear safety assessment unit. At
Fortum, this is the responsibility of the Nuclear Safety Oversight unit; its task is to
review the impacts of dif ferent factors on safety . Fortum's own operating
experiences and those of other nuclear power plants, as well as the results of peer
and authority assessments are combined with plant- and company-specific nuclear
safety and quality expertise.

production
Combined heat and power production (CHP) substantially increases
the ef ficiency of primary energy use. Fortum has strong expertise in
CHP.
CHP technology combines heat and power production and, in some cases, also
production of cooling energy into one process. In terms of fuels, CHP is a flexible
method of energy production; the benefits of its dif ferent products – district heat,
steam, cooling, as well as new products, like bio-oil – enable sustainable energy
production.
CHP improves the efficiency of primary
energy use
With the scarcity of global natural resources, resource ef ficiency – both in
production and use of energy – will be further emphasised. It is vital for the
environment to utilise the available natural resources and energy sources as
efficiently as possible. CHP has an important role in enhancing resource
efficiency , as it substantially increases the ef ficiency of primary energy use.
Almost 90% of the primary energy of fuel can be utilised in the CHP process.
Fortum has strong expertise in CHP
Fortum has extensive experience in CHP production in Finland, Sweden, Russia,
Poland, the Baltic countries and Great Britain. W e own 19 CHP plants in Europe
and eight, mostly gas-fired, CHP plants in Russia. In 2012, CHP production
accounted for 32% of our total power production and 79% of our total heat
production.
Fortum provides district heat in dozens of cities, including Stockholm (Sweden),
Espoo (Finland), W roclaw and Czestochowa (Poland), as well as Chelyabinsk,
Tyumen and T obolsk (Russia). A significant share of Fortum's district heat is
produced in CHP plants. Fortum's CHP plants also produce heat, steam and
cooling for industry .
Diverse use of fuels
Fortum utilises a diverse and flexible mix of energy sources in its CHP production,
andaims at increasing the use of renewable fuels . In Europe, we use biomass
and bioliquids, peat, waste-derived fuels, natural gas, coal and oil for fuel. In
Russia, natural gas and coal are used for fuel. In 2012, Fortum used a total of 6.1
terawatt-hours (TWh) of biomass and other biofuels. The amount slightly
decreased from 201 1.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Increasing the use of bioenergy was researched at many power plants during
2012. At the Värtan power plant in Sweden, testing the use of olive stones in the
fuel mix continued. Altogether 14,400 tonnes were burned and their share in the
fuel used was 4%. At the Czestochowa CHP plant in Poland, the share of
biomass in fuel use increased from 22% to 32% during 2012. Fortum is also a
leading user of municipal waste in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Utilising
municipal waste is an essential part of sustainable waste management because it
can reduce the amount of waste that would otherwise end up in landfills.
Availability of CHP plants at a good level
High availability of a power plant is extremely important both from an economic
and environmental point of view . High availability enables cost-ef ficient and safe
use of a power plant and reliable energy delivery . Unscheduled shut-downs result
in production losses, a strain of power plant components and energy losses.
Consequently , the availability of power plants has a direct impact on the
profitability of energy production.
Energy availability is the most common form of availability reported at power
plants. Since the beginning of 2013 Fortum has set the availability of its European
CHP plants as one sustainability performance indicator . The target level is 92%.
In 2012, the availability figure was 87%.
New CHP capacity under construction
Fortum is continuously building new combined heat and power capacity . Our long-
term investment programme emphasises replacing heat-only plants with new
CHP plants. New CHP plants utilising biomass and waste are currently under
construction in Klaipeda, Lithuania; Jelgava, Latvia; Brista, Sweden; and
Järvenpää, Finland. Additionally , Fortum is building a pyrolysis technology-based
plant producing bio-oil at the Joensuu CHP plant , in Finland.
Reducing CHP’ s environmental impacts
Due to its high energy ef ficiency , emissions from CHP production
per produced energy unit are low compared to the separate
production of electricity and heat.
CHP production is based on the combustion of fuels, and its most significant
environmental impacts are related to flue-gas emissions, emissions to water , and
wastes and by-products, like ash and desulphurisation products. The impacts of
CHP production on the environment can be reduced with the use of various
combustion and flue gas cleaning technologies and by shifting from fossil fuels to
renewable fuels.

SUST AINABILITY REPOR T 2012 87
This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/The overall ef ficiency of fuel use in CHP production is high compared to
theseparate production of electricity and heat, and therefore the emissions per
produced energy unit are lower . Compared to separate production, CHP reduces
the environmental impacts when the heat produced by the plant can be utilised in
the surrounding area of the production plant. With CHP , also the thermal load into
water systems in the form of waste heat is significantly reduced.
The main way to reduce the environmental impacts of CHP production is to shift
from fossil fuels to renewable fuels. This reduces carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide
and particle emissions, and, depending on the combustion technique, there is
also a reduction in nitrogen oxide. The environmental impacts of CHP plants are
regulated by plant-specific environmental permits, which set limitations for
emissions and obligations for monitoring and reporting emissions.
In 2012, Fortum continued preparations for the investments needed to fulfil the
new emissions requirements set by the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) from
2016 onwards in the EU countries. The IED tightens the emissions requirements
for practically all Fortum's thermal power plants (CHP plants and condensing
power plants). In Russia, ef forts are made to reduce the environmental impacts of
Fortum's CHP production by using better quality coal, which reduces sulphur
dioxide and particle emissions per produced energy .
At Fortum's plants in Europe, by-products and waste are utilised and recycled as
efficiently as possible. In 2012, the utilisation rate for ash was 51% and for
gypsum 42%. In Russia, ash is stored in ash basins because there is no demand
for ash usage.
The impacts of thermal power plants on water systems are caused by the thermal
load of cooling water , the release of solids, and nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy
metal emissions. In CHP production, the need for cooling water is minimal and
thus the thermal load into water systems is low . Wastewater from power plants is
cleaned mechanically , chemically or biologically before being released into water
systems. The wastewater of some plants is piped into municipal wastewater
networks. In recent years, Fortum's Russian plants have had repeated
exceedances of wastewater permit conditions; to remedy the situation,
improvements to the wastewater treatment process were implemented at the
plants in 2012.The measures included, among others, the separation and
reduction of water flows from the coal-fired plants through ash basins.

District heat and combined heat and power production have proved
to be key solutions in achieving Europe's energy-ef ficiency targets.
Effective incentive mechanisms are needed to realise new investments and to

markets where district heat is one option among other heating methods, like
electricity , heat pumps, and heat only boilers fuelled by wood, pellets or gas.
The majority of Eastern Europe's district heating systems are in need of
refurbishment. In fact, there is a continuous political debate under way in many
countries about the best heat market models and the pricing of district heat.
Fortum has studied and compared the regulatory practices applied in dif ferent
areas of Europe. Based on the assessment, it is clear that district heat companies
should be of fered ef fective and appropriate financial incentives to support
competitive district heating and to secure heat distribution. In 2012, Fortum

Electricity distribution reliability is becoming increasingly important
for society and its abundant use of electricity . The needs of
consumers and society alike demand smart electricity networks.
Fortum continuously invests in network updates and maintenance and in further
improving security of supply . In 2012, the Distribution business area invested in
Finland, Sweden and Norway a total of EUR 324 million. The majority of these
investments targeted smart meters, underground cables, overhead lines and
substations that function as junctions in electricity distribution. Network
automation for the critical parts of the grid also has been increased.
Shortening and decreasing power
outages
Through its electricity network investments, Fortum aims to make the network
smarter and to decrease and shorten power outages. In 2012, the system
average interruption duration indicator (SAIDI) per customer in Fortum's network
was 103 minutes, and the customer average interruption duration indicator
(CAIDI) was 61 minutes. Fortum has set a SAIDI target of <1 10 minutes for 2013.
Fortum is focusing more strongly on developing a weather-proof network.
Underground cabling is becoming more common, and it is Fortum's preferred way
of building the new network.
After the widespread damages caused by the winter storm in Finland in 201 1,
Fortum launched the V ahvaV erkko project aiming to improve reliability of
electricity distribution at an accelerated pace and, by the end of 2014, to add
90,000 more Fortum customers to the 200,000 who are already within the scope
of weather-proof electricity distribution in Finland. The long-term goal is to cut the
number of power outages in half and to double the number of customers currently
within the scope of weather-proof distribution in Finland by 2020.
In Sweden, the SäkraNät network investment program continued. The initial
target of the programme, launched in 2006 following the winter storm Gudrun,
was to cut the outage times for Fortum's customers in the rural network areas by
half in five years. This target was reached in 2010 but the programme is still

Energy distribution is a key element of society's infrastructure, and
the uninterrupted distribution of energy supports a functioning
society .
Construction, use and maintenance of the energy distribution network impact the
surrounding environment. Environmental impacts are reduced through careful
operational planning and technology solutions and by practicing environmentally
benign ways of operating.
Electricity distribution operations
When planning an electricity distribution network, the impacts on land use, the
landscape and nature are taken into consideration. Through the planning, zoning
and permit processes, the aim is to find the best solution for society for securing
electricity distribution.
In the construction phase of a distribution network, environmental impacts are
caused by e.g. the removal of trees, construction traf fic, noise and dust. In the
construction phase of a distribution network, waste and environmental aspects
are taken into consideration already in the contractor selection process, and
environmental impacts are reduced through careful operational planning and by
practicing environmentally benign ways of operating.
The distribution network is inspected, maintained and renewed regularly .
Improvements in electricity distribution reliability are achieved through
underground cabling, by moving power lines from the forests to the roadsides and
public areas whenever possible, and by clearing power line corridors.
Underground cabling also protects biodiversity and reduces the impact on the
landscape and birds. Bird collisions are reduced by mounting marker balls on
overhead lines and landing perches on poles.
Efforts are made to recycle waste material that is created in the construction and
renewal of distribution networks. In 2012, Fortum's distribution operations
created 7,800 tonnes of waste, 86% of which was recycled and 14% was
disposed of in landfills. Contaminated soil areas from transformer oil leaks are
cleaned as quickly as possible. New transformers sit on oil trays to prevent oil
from seeping into the environment in the event of an accident. In Norway , the aim
is to use biogradeable oil in transformers located in groundwater areas.
District heat operations
The environmental impacts of district heat distribution occur in the network
construction phase. They are temporary in nature and common to other
construction projects in society .
The distribution
network is inspected,
maintained and
renewed regularly .

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/With the exception of occasional water leaks, there are no environmental impacts
arising from the use of district heat networks.
Uninterrupted heat distribution a priority
The uninterrupted supply of district heat is important, particularly in
the cold conditions of the north. Fortum is continuously improving
the reliability of its district heat networks by repairing faults found
during scheduled maintenance and by investing in new network
when needed.
As a result of interruptions caused by various reasons, district heat customers in
the Nordic countries are without heat supply for only 1–2 hours per year on
average. About half of the interruptions are caused by damage to the network and
the work to repair it, and half are for some other reason, like network
refurbishment work and connecting new customers to the district heat network. In
general, new connections and district heat network branching can be
implemented without interrupting heat distribution.
When doing repair work that will cause an interruption in distribution, the aim is to
schedule the work outside the heating season.
Heat losses a challenge in Russia
In Russia, Fortum produces more than 90% of the district heat demand of the
cities T yumen, Chelyabinsk, T obolsk and Ozerk. Fortum is aiming to build modern
and energy-ef ficient heat distribution systems in the cities within its operating
area. Refurbishment measures can reduce heat losses from district heat
networks by 20–30%.
Fortum continued the modernisation of the Chelyabinsk district heat network
infrastructure in 2012. The city's radial heat distribution network will be changed
to one with an encircling pipeline. Development of a modern heat distribution
network also continued in T yumen.
Smart meters also for the heat network
Smart metering and control systems give also heat network customers the
opportunity to influence their own heat consumption. With smart meters, data is
received in real-time and heat consumption monitoring is more ef ficient.
All Fortum's district heat customers in Finland have been within the sphere of
smart metering since the beginning of 2010. In Sweden and Latvia, the majority of
customers are also within the sphere of smart metering. In Jelgava, Latvia,
installation of automated smart meters started in 2012.
District heating is an
energy-ef ficient way to
heat population
centres.

Fortum has an EUR 2.5 billion capacity investment programme in Russia. The
programme consists of eight units, three of which have already been
commissioned. The value of the remaining part of the investment programme,
calculated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of December 2012, is
estimated to be approximately EUR 540 million as of January 2013.
The investment programme's biggest units (3 x 418 MW) are being constructed in
Nyagan, W estern Siberia. Fortum estimates that the units will be commissioned
during 2013.
In summer 2012, Fortum announced that the last two 250-MW units of the
investment programme will be built at Chelyabinsk GRES power plant in the
Urals. The units are planned to be commissioned by the end of 2014. Fortum also
plans to modernise and upgrade the existing equipment of the power plant.
Divesting non-strategic operations
In 2012, Fortum divested several of its holdings that are not central to the
company's strategy . Among others, small hydropower plants in Finland and
Sweden were sold to focus the company's resources on large-scale hydropower .
Additionally , small heat business operations were divested in order to focus on
larger-scale CHP production.
Electricity network operations in Estonia were also divested during the year
(Fortum Elekter was sold to Imatran Seudun Sähkö), and the share in the Dalarna
electricity retail company in Sweden was sold. In Russia, Fortum sold its heat
network located in Surgut to the city's electricity and heat distribution
company; Surgut is remotely located compared to Fortum's other operations and
Fortum didn't have its own CHP production in Surgut.

Fortum expects its business partners to act responsibly and to
comply with the Fortum Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of
Conduct.
TheFortum Code of Conduct provides the basis for ethical business conduct, and
Fortum's Supplier Code of Conduct sets the basic sustainability requirements for
suppliers of services and goods. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the
principles of the United Nations Global Compact and is divided into four sections:
business practices, human rights, labour standards and the environment. The
Supplier Code of Conduct is implemented in all Fortum's operating countries and
it is included in all purchase agreements exceeding 50,000 euros.
Pre-selection and supplier audits to
support assessment
We assess the level of operations of our business partners through pre-selection
and supplier audits. Pre-selection includes a supplier questionnaire and
verification of credit. The supplier questionnaire is used to identify general and
sustainability-related practices, and it helps suppliers to understand Fortum's
expectations for compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct. The supplier
questionnaire also helps to identify potential high-risk suppliers and thus the need
for further actions.
The Supplier Code of Conduct is instructed to be used also in the Russia
Division, and in 2013 the target is to implement Corporate instructions regarding
supplier pre-selection. In 2012, the current practices related to supplier selection
were reviewed.
We started sustainability-related supplier audits in 2012. A goal was set to audit
three risk-country suppliers in each division, excluding the Russia Division.
Fortum's classification of risk countries is based on the ILO's Decent W ork
Agenda, the UN Human Development Index, and T ransparency International's
Corruption Perceptions Index. The goal was reached in the Heat Division (a total
of 5 audits) and in the Power Division (3 audits), but not in ESD (1 audit). In 2013,
Fortum will continue the supplier audits, again with the goal in each division to
audit additional three risk-country suppliers or suppliers otherwise classified as
high-risk suppliers. The intention is to start the audits also in the Russia Division.
The audit assesses the supplier's compliance with the requirements in Fortum's
Supplier Code of Conduct. If non-compliances are found, the supplier makes a
plan for corrective actions and we monitor the implementation of it. In the supplier
audits conducted in 2012, the most significant non-compliances were related to
occupational safety and overtime hours.

Fortum's own personnel are responsible for the supplier audits. Auditors receive
1.5 days of internal training, during which they review the requirements of the
Supplier Code of Conduct, the sub-areas to be audited, and the tools to be used
to verify compliance with the requirements. After the training, supplier audits are
started together with an experienced auditor . Our goal is to train auditors from
different divisions and operating countries. In 2012, we trained a total of seven
auditors from Finland and Sweden.
Responsible fuel purchasing
Fortum actively participates in the discussion about responsible fuel
purchasing with companies in the sector and with stakeholders.
Fuels represent a significant purchasing category at Fortum, EUR 1,057 million in
2012. An increasing attention is being paid to the origin and sustainability of the
fuels in purchasing.
Natural gas
In 2012, the natural gas used in Fortum's operations in Russia, the Baltic
countries, Poland and Finland originated from Russia, where the gas is
purchased from several suppliers. Gas used in Sweden's operations originated
from Norway .In Great Britain, Fortum purchases natural gas from the national
gas network and it originates mostly from the Britain and Norwegian gas fields in
the North Sea.
Coal
In 2012, all of the coal used by Fortum in Finland and Sweden originated from
Russia. Coal used in Polish power plants mainly originated from Poland, but there
were also small amounts imported from Russia and the Czech Republic. Fortum's
Russian power plants used coal from Russia and Kazakhstan.
In 2012, Fortum joined the Bettercoal initiative to promote the principles of
sustainable development in coal mining. Bettercoal's Code of Conduct-related
stakeholder event was held in Russia in November 2012.
Biomass and bioliquids
In 2012, the majority (77%) of the biomass used by Fortum consisted of wood
pellets, wood chips and industrial wood residues that originated from Finland,

Fortum recognises the challenges related to the origin of biomass and other
biofuels and develops measures to verify the traceability and sustainability of
fuels. Fortum's goal is to create a system in 2013 to monitor the volume of
certified wood-based biomass used as fuel.
In Sweden, Fortum's subsidiary Fortum Värme is a participant of the WWF Global
Forest & T rade Network (GFTN) through GFTN Sweden. Additionally , Fortum
Värme has been a member of the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)
since 2005 and became a member of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in
2012.
Uranium
Loviisa's fuel assemblies are completely of Russian origin. The Dalur uranium
mine received ISO 14001 environmental certification in September 2012. The
supplier's goal is to get certification also for the other mines supplying uranium to
Fortum. The zirconium material manufacturing plant and the plant responsible for
manufacturing uranium oxide pellets and fuel assemblies also have ISO 14001
and OHSAS 18001 certification.
Fortum carries out regular reviews of the quality , environmental, and health and
safety management systems of its nuclear fuel suppliers and the manufacturing of
nuclear fuel assemblies. In 2012, Fortum's experts reviewed the fuel supplier's
uranium mine in Russia. A similar visit is scheduled for summer 2013.

Fortum's policy is to pay taxes on the earnings, production, employment and property of each of the Group's
businesses in accordance with each country's local regulations.
Fortum operates in accordance with its shareholders' interests and takes into consideration taxation aspects:
•bysupporting Fortum's overall strategy
•by ensuring that the management of tax issues is in line with prevailing laws and regulations
•by paying particular attention to communicating the required information transparently , accurately and at the correct time
to tax authorities and investors
Fortum's goal is to handle tax issues in the most appropriate way rather than simply to minimise taxation. T axation aspects are
taken into account in decision making, and they can have an impact on, for example, the choice of a country for business
operations. It is Fortum's policy to concentrate its corporate functions in EU countries and to avoid tax havens. Fortum
hasparticipations in two tax haven companies: for insurance-technical reasons, in the fully-owned captive insurance company in
Guernsey; and in the Cayman Islands, a stake in the Nature Elements Asia Renewable Energy and Cleantech Fund L.P ., which
makes research and development investments. Fortum's earnings from both companies are subject to normal taxation in Finland.
In 2012, Fortum launched two tax appeals. In Sweden, a tax appeal was submitted regarding the right to deduct interest in
computing taxable income, and in Belgium regarding taxation of a financing company . Decisions on the appeals are expected
during 2015. More information is available in Financials 2012 .
In 2012, Fortum’ s total tax rate was 29.0% (EUR 562 million). The share attributable to income taxes payable for Fortum’ s financial
period was EUR 203 million.

Fortum develops products and services that meet the needs of its
customers, ensures the reliable delivery of electricity and heat, and
builds future energy solutions.
Fortum has 1.2 million electricity customers and 1.6 million electricity distribution
customers in Finland, Sweden and Norway . The company has district heat
customers in dozens of cities in eight countries. In 2012, we introduced numerous
new consumer products and improved communication in power outage situations.
We also continued investments to improve reliability of the distribution network.
Customer satisfaction is of utmost importance to Fortum. W e regularly assess
customer satisfaction and feedback so that we can better meet customers’
expectations. W e involve customers also in the development of existing and new
products and services.
Customer satisfaction
is of utmost
importance to Fortum.
Climate-benign products for customers
Fortum sells electricity to private and business customers and heat
to companies, municipalities and private customers. An increasing
number of customers require a guarantee of origin for the electricity
they buy , i.e. information about the way the electricity is produced.
In 2012, all electricity sold to private customers in Finland was CO 2-free,
produced by hydropower and wind power . The origin of hydropower and wind
power was guaranteed with European Guarantees of Origin or with the
EKOenergy label of the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation.
In 2012, all electricity in Sweden was sold with an environmental value.
Customers can choose either the Fortum Enkel product, which is electricity
produced from a mix of wind power and hydropower , or they can choose either
wind or hydropower as their energy source. The Fortum Enkel product has the
Swedish Society for Nature Conservation’ s Good Environmental Choice label.

In Sweden, customers who don’t choose eco-labelled electricity receive electricity
produced with nuclear power , which is carbon dioxide-free in the production
phase. Also customers in Norway are of fered CO 2-free electricity produced 100%
with renewable energy .
Energy-efficiency products and services
In 2012, Fortum introduced new energy-ef ficiency products and services that give
consumers a lot of information about their electricity consumption and enable
consumers to automatically or actively control their electricity consumption and to
produce some electricity for their own use or sell some of it to Fortum. The
Fortum Kotinäyttö (Home Display) for consumers shows the household’ s
electricity consumption in real-time. The data makes it easy to identify the most
significant opportunities to save energy and thus facilitates the timing and
planning of energy conservation measures.
The Fortum Fiksu (Fortum Smart) product, targetting customers who have
electrically heated water boilers, automatically shifts the heating of the water
boiler to the hours when electricity costs are lowest. Shifting the heating to the
hours when electricity prices are cheapest evens out consumption peaks and
help customers to reduce their electricity bill. An electricity agreement with hourly-
based pricing makes it possible to take advantage of the lowest hourly rates.
With the Fortum Solar Kit connected to the grid, customers can replace some of
their purchased electricity with their own electricity production. By signing a
special agreement with Fortum, customers can sell their own surplus electricity
that they have produced to Fortum at a wholesale electricity price.
Fortum actively promotes the adoption of electric vehicles and develops solutions
that enable smart charging of electric vehicle batteries based on the electricity
market situation and price.
Fortum actively monitors the development of the Nordic electricity retail market
in its product development.
Nordic electricity retail market
The continuous development of the Nordic electricity retail market improves
competition and expands the service selection. The role of consumers also
becomes more active. The adoption of smart electricity meters and new energy-
efficient services and the development of distributed small-scale production,
among other things, help consumers to better manage their own energy
consumption and thus also their electricity bill and carbon footprint.
In 2012, noteworthy initiatives regarding the exchange of information were made
in the EU and the Nordic countries. They aim to improve the ef ficiency of

harmonise the billing of electric energy and electricity transmission fees.
Climate-benign heat products
A climate-neutral heat product is available for district heating customers in
Finland and Sweden. This product allows customers to of fset the greenhouse
gases of district heating by purchasing international emission reduction units.
In 2012, Fortum introduced new products for district heating customers in
Sweden and Finland. Customers and co-ops can now choose between dif ferent
products based on their consumption profile and preferences, rather than having
just one alternative. The district heat product of fering is actively developed, and a
services development project with three pilot customers was launched in October
2012 in Finland.
Services for customers
In 2012, Fortum developed its customer channels and invested in
distribution network improvements.
Fortum introduced a text message service to provide its electricity distribution
customers in the Nordic countries with information about power outages.
Widespread distribution disruptions are also communicated through social media
channels and on Fortum’ s website. The customer service capacity also has been
increased to serve customers in widespread power outage situations.
Fortum increased its investments in weather-proof network construction in
Finland with the V ahvaV erkko project launched in February 2012. The goal is to
have 90,000 more customers within the sphere of the weather-proof network by
the end of 2014. A long-term goal is to cut the number of power outages by half.
Additionally , the aim is to double the number of customers within the sphere of the
weather-proof network by 2020.
In Sweden, the SäkraNät project improving electricity distribution reliability
continued with a focus on grid areas in central Sweden.
Services for heat customers
Fortum is improving the reliability of its district heating network by repairing
malfunctions detected in conjunction with regular maintenance and by investing in
new networks when needed. Smart metering and control systems give heating
network customers the opportunity to influence their own heat consumption. All of

In Jelgava, Latvia, installation of automated smart meters started in 2012.
In 2012, Fortum opened up the possibility for customers in Stockholm, Sweden,
to sell the surplus heat they produce to Fortum's heating network at market price.
The first agreements were signed with customers in June, and many customers
have signed letters of intent.
Fortum is actively developing heating services also in Russia by modernising the
heating networks in Chelyabinsk and T yumen. Launched in 201 1, the
modernisation of Chelyabinsk district heating networks continued in 2012. In the
project, the city's heat distribution network is being changed form radial design to
an encircling desing to allow the load to be distributed evenly .
The infrastructure development programme under way in T yumen will improve the
reliability of heat distribution and reduce the amount of heat energy lost by one
third in the main distribution network.
Demand-side management
Fortum increases its customers’ electricity demand flexibility by
offering products that are based on dif ferent pricing models and by
promoting smart electricity meters.
In market-based, hourly-priced electricity retail products, the price for electricity is
based on the hourly spot price on the Nord Pool Spot electricity exchange. Along
with electricity products based on hourly pricing, Fortum also sells traditionally
priced electricity; its price is based on the price development of electricity futures
on the Nasdaq OMX Commodities. Customers can choose an electricity
agreement with prices that are updated based on changes in the market price, for
example, every month, every three months, or every two years.
Alternatives for electricity distribution
pricing
Currently , pricing in electricity distribution for the majority of business customers is
based on the electrical power used. Household electricity distribution customers,
in turn, have the option to choose a two-time metering and tarif f, making the
electricity price lower at night. The system is particularly suitable for distribution
customers with electrically heated water boilers. Hourly-based monitoring of
consumption will of fer opportunities also for the development of transmission
tariffs and load services. Load management services are also available for large-
volume customers.

Distribution’ s sizable smart meter project is a significant step towards promoting
demand flexibility . Replacing old electricity meters with hourly-based meters
improves load management and increases opportunities for energy savings. In
Finland, customers can monitor their electricity consumption online through the
VALPAS service virtually in real-time; they can also compare their own
consumption against their comparison group’ s electricity usage and see the
impact that various measures have on their own consumption. This way ,
customers get a better picture of their electricity usage and can also have an
impact on it.
Legislation on hourly-based electricity metering in Finland will take ef fect on 1
January 2014. In Finland, about 620,000 of Fortum’ s distribution customers will
have received new meters before the end of 2013. By the end of 2012, about
434,000 customers had received new meters. In Sweden, the installation of smart
meters for customers was completed earlier . In Norway , the planning of the smart
meter system is continuing, and the preliminary legislation on it will take ef fect on
1 January 2019.
Aiming for engaged and satisfied employees
The aim of Fortum's personnel strategy is to promote the
commitment and well-being of employees in line with the company's
business goals.
In 2012, the focus was on increasing personnel engagement, continuous
development of competence, advancing overall well-being at work, and clarifying
Fortum-wide HR processes. At the end of 2012, Fortum had 10,371 employees,
of which the majority , 4,252, worked in Russia.
Employee survey: Stronger engagement
In addition to employee satisfaction, the Fortum Sound employee survey also
measured employee commitment to the business, to customers and to shared
goals. The sub-areas of the survey included e.g. leadership, well-being,
operational excellence, customer orientation and sustainability . The previous
survey was conducted in 2009.
The 2012 survey was completed by 7,528 Fortum employees, a response rate of
79% (2009: 81%). In light of the survey's reference material, Fortum's strengths
were overall well-being at work, teamwork, and the possibility to influence the
content of one's own work. Employee engagement rose to 65% (Fortum Sound

initiative to develop the corporate culture contributed to the positive development.
Fortum's development targets identified on the basis of the survey are improving
internal collaboration and strengthening customer orientation.
Overall well-being at work is good
91% of the employees responding to the survey feel they have the work capacity
to perform their duties ef fectively .
The majority of the respondents feel there is a good balance between their work
and personal life, and 90% of Fortum employees enjoy being part of their own
team. Additionally , employees feel that safe ways of working have been well
embraced at Fortum.
Key behaviours as part of everyday
activities
Fortum's key behaviours have been defined as challenge, co-create, coach and
celebrate. According to the Sensor survey that measures the realisation of the
LPG initiative, Fortum's key behaviours have become an increasingly visible part
of everyday activities. Compared to 201 1, the results for all key behaviours have
improved.
In 2012, the connection between the LPG initiative and the strategy and business
planning was strengthened. For example, a T eam Assignment tool is used in the
Heat Scandinavia organisation to clarify goals, roles and responsibilities. The tool
helps to link the goals of the teams and the individuals to the business goals.
Leadership Impact is a leadership development programme that is enhancing
productivity and developing the leadership skills of managers. In 2012, over 500
managers from dif ferent countries participated in the programme.
Fortum's revised Code of Conduct
familiar to the entire personnel
Fortum's Code of Conduct defines the general principles on how we treat others,
how we engage in business and how we safeguard our corporate assets. The
Code of Conduct was adopted in 2007 and revised in spring 2012. By the end of
February 2013, 99% of the personnel had completed the training for the updated
Code of Conduct. The training will continue in 2013.
Positive employer image
In a survey of students and young professionals, conducted by the employer

Group-level HR processes
Fortum's six Group-level HR processes are:
•Manage Strategic HR Planning
•Recruit and Select Employees
•Develop Employees
•Reward and Retain Employees
•Re-deploy and Retire Employees
•Manage Employee Information
Defining and implementing the common processes will continue in 2013 - 2014,
when the focus also will be on developing processes based on comparable
metrics in order to monitor operational ef ficiency in detail and to develop HR
services in a more systematic way .
In 2012, all of Fortum's operating countries used common processes in
performance development discussions, talent management, and recruiting.
Increasing employee engagement and
development
One of the most important development projects in 2012 was the implementation
of the Career Development Framework model to improve employee engagement
and development.
The aim of the Career Development Framework is to:
•Align human resources management with Fortum's strategy
•Ensure future leadership through ef fective talent management
•Develop clear role and competence descriptions to clarify expectations
for employees
•Promote career development with consistent employee development
•Harmonise rewarding practices
The practical rollout of the model started in spring 2012. The first target group
consisted of approximately 1,000 employees from the Nordic countries, Poland

Group-level criteria for talent
management
The Group-wide T alent Management model was renewed in 2012. The key
criteria for competence were defined as operating in line with the company's
values, achieving set goals, and the sub-areas of leadership competence. The
goal is to ensure suf ficient expertise and leadership potential to realise the
strategy , achieve profitability and growth.
Employee mobility
In 2012, Fortum's Employee Mobility concept was created to clarify procedures in
different job rotation situations nationally and internationally . In addition, the
concept defines various mobility models and the related conditions of
employment. The aim is to have models for monitoring and developing internal
mobility at Fortum.
Combining personal and strategic goals
Fortum strives to put the company's strategic goals into practice at the
organisation, team and employee level. The key implementation tool is the
Performance Development Process (PDP), which is used to ensure the
realisation of business goals also at the individual level.
The PDP process is applicable to all permanent employees, but in 2012 the
electronic tool covered only 64% of the personnel. Fortum is able to follow the
completion of PDP process only for those employees who have the possibility to
use the electronic tool. Of these, 96% participated in the PDP process.

ForCARE is Fortum's model for overall well-being at work, which
promotes health and work safety , employee work capacity and work
community functionality . The overall situation regarding well-being
at work was mapped in 2012.
The ForCARE model emphasises the personal responsibility that each individual
in the work community has for their own well-being and competence and for
working together to develop the well-being of the work community . A new index
measuring overall well-being was included in the Fortum Sound employee survey
in 2012. Among other things, it measured opinions related to the openness of the
dialogue in the work community , personal accountability , and the level of
challenge of work tasks. The result of the index was 3.88 (on a scale of 1-5).
In addition to the overall work well-being index, work well-being is also monitored
with other Group-level key indicators, such as the ratio between actual retirement
age and the statutory start of the retirement pension. In 2012, 137 people retired
from Fortum (201 1: 151). The figure includes age-related, early and disability
retirement. The average retirement age was 61. In 2012, Fortum had 769 (201 1:
773) employees who were over the age of 60.

We want to be a company where the employees and the contractors
and service providers that work for us can come to work safely and
leave for home at the end of the work day unharmed. W e believe
that all work injuries are preventable when the competence and the
right attitude prevails, when potential risks are addressed and when
measures are taken to protect against them.
The systematic work to improve occupational safety continued in 2012. The lost
workday injury frequency (L WIF) per million work hours for Fortum's own
personnel was 1.5 (201 1: 1.6). The L WIF for contractors was 3.8 (201 1: 3.2). In
2012, one fatal accident involving a contractor's employee occurred at the
Nyagan construction site in Russia. Additionally , there were more injuries to
contractors in the European operations than in the previous year .
The situation in plant safety improved compared to 201 1. There were 20 incidents
of fires and chemical leaks of over 100 litres in 2012 (201 1: 44). There were three
INES 1 (International Nuclear Event Scale) events at the Loviisa plant (201 1: 0).
They didn't cause any injuries to people or damage to the plant or the
environment.
During the year Fortum defined new safety ground rules, renewed the safety
video and safety handbook, and updated the occupational safety training
programme "Stop and think". In addition to lowering the injury frequency ,a Group-
wide target, starting 1.1.2013, was also defined for environmental and safety
incidents (fires, leaks, explosions, dam and nuclear safety incidents, and
environmental non-compliances).
Contractor safety
The management of contractor occupational safety – from the selection of
contractors to the final assessment of the work – was developed during the year .
A common management model will be adopted throughout Fortum in 2013.
Contactor safety was also taken more widely into the target setting and the
management incentive system.
The Electricity Solutions and Distribution Division took into use a new online
training programme aimed at contractors and a new practice for assessing
contractors. As a new practice, regular safety meetings were taken into use with
the companies identified as having had the biggest shortcomings in occupational
safety . The measures defined after the fatal injury of a contractor in Sweden in
2011, such as better guidelines for routine electrical work, were implemented in
Norway and Finland, in addition to Sweden.
The Power and Heat Divisions developed work permit practices, improved the
occupational safety management of contractors performing annual maintenance,
and improved the work safety of those working in investment projects.

need for improved implementation of Fortum's occupational safety practices for
the contractors working in projects.
Goal-oriented safety improvement
Implementation of the minimum requirements defined in 201 1 for environmental,
health and safety (EHS) management progressed at the power plants with current
situation analyses and development measures. The minimum requirements will
be fully implemented in 2013. A new reporting and management system for EHS
non-compliances was developed and tested in 2012, and its implementation will
be decided on in 2013.
The Power Division continued implementation of the "365 safe days" programme
by completing the safety refresher training and by expanding the training to cover
also permanent contractors at the biggest power plants. Another focus area was
electrical safety; an e-learning package was created to support it. The same
training was used also in other divisions.
In the Fortum Heat Division, it was agreed to expand the use of the proactive
safety index, developed in Sweden, to other countries in 2013. A new safety
model covering the entire investment project was tested in CHP projects, and it
was agreed that it would be used in CHP projects in 2013.
In Poland, the integration of the Zabrze and the Bytom plants with Fortum
continued according to plan. The work focused on occupational safety and on
plant safety investments for handling coal dust and plant start-ups. The results
were excellent: there were no fires or leaks at the plants and only one injury
resulting in an absence.
The ISO 14001 environmental certification and OHSAS 18001 occupational
health and safety certification processes advanced as planned in Poland; the
certification audits are scheduled for the first half of 2013.
The most important measures in the Baltic operations were the "Stop and think"
safety training and the active work of the EHS team. In Sweden, the ef forts to
reduce fires and chemical leaks were successful. Improvements were
made especially in the safe handling of bio-oil.
The Russia Division continued implementing the EHS plan to improve work and
plant safety . OHSAS 18001 certification progressed and Fortum passed the
certification audit in December 2012. Elimination of the asbestos risk in Russia is
also part of the EHS programme goals. During the year , about 320 tonnes of
asbestos were removed and procedures for the handling and removal of asbestos
were improved.

From the media's perspective, Fortum's operations are especially
interesting because the company is one of the biggest listed
companies in Finland and is one of the biggest players also in
Sweden in the energy sector .
The State's majority ownership in the company also increases interest both by the
media and the general public. In other countries where it operates, Fortum is a
foreign leader in the energy sector .
Fortum's communications is directed by the laws and regulations governing the
communications of listed companies. Additionally , Fortum communicates in
accordance with the company's communications principles, which emphasise
impartial, correctly-timed and open communication. Fortum engages in a
continuous dialogue with the media at financial press conferences held quarterly
and during other visits, and by giving interviews and responding to daily media
contacts.
A particular focus in 2012 was on strengthening Fortum's crisis communication
preparedness. A staf fed Media Desk service was launched in Finland; it had
previously been implemented in Sweden. The use of social media was deployed
both for continuous communications and especially for communicating electricity
and heat outages and engaging in a direct dialogue with customers.
Fortum's Crisis Communications Guidelines were updated to cover key
exceptional situations and drills of dif ferent situations – especially power outages
– were held. Additionally ,183 Fortum employees working in the ESD Division's
customer service received training in crisis preparedness . Moreover , the load
handling capacity of the Fortum's internet sites was improved and separate
communications channels for authorities were established for major power
outages.
Fortum engages in a
continuous dialogue
with the media.
Support for society
We support organisations and communities working for the common
good in the countries where we operate. The goal is for sponsorship
collaboration to be mutually beneficial.
In 2012, Fortum's support for activities promoting the common good totalled about
EUR 5.8 million (201 1: 4.6), of which the share of grants awarded by the Fortum
Foundation was about EUR 780,000 (201 1: 700,000). Fortum Foundation supports

We engage in collaboration with environmental organisations
regarding the eco-labelling of electricity products, and we participate
in projects related to environmental conservation and maintaining
biodiversity . In addition, many of our sponsorhip programmes are
implemented in co-operation with organisations.
Part of the funding for the environmental projects comes from the sales of eco-
labelled electricity . In Sweden, we are a member in the WWF Global Forest and
Trade Network promoting responsible forestry . In 2012, we joined the Bettercoal
initiative promoting sustainability principles in coal mining.
Sponsorship programmes
Our sponsorship programmes focus on environmental and social responsibility ,
and the projects target mainly on young people and local activities. Fortum has
collaborated with the John Nurminen Foundation since 2006. The collaboration
was extended last year with a four-year letter of intent. Fortum will support the
Clean Baltic Sea projects with EUR 75,000-100,000 yearly between 2012 and
2015.
Support for youth sporting activities
In Finland, physical activities for children and young people are supported
through the Fortum T utor programme and Para School Day events. Fortum T utor,
implemented in collaboration with the Football Association of Finland, develops
the skills of junior football coaches in over 60 municipalities. Annually , the
programme reaches about 20,000–30,000 families. The Fortum Para School Day
tour, implemented in collaboration with the Finnish Paralympics Committee,
encouraged the physical activities of children and young people at six schools
around Finland in 2012.
The joint programme by Fortum and the Finnish Association for Swimming
Instruction and Life Saving (FSL) teaches child water safety and alertness to
entire families. The Fortum V esikoulu (W ater School) events held around Finland
taught water safety to over 1,000 preschoolers. About 6,500 visitors participated
in the related events in 2012.
A workshop project, implemented in Finland together with Bass Campus ry , and a
project implemented in Poland with the Ulica organisation and the local sports
academy A WF Katowice inspire and guide local youth to get involved in activities

Fortum works closely with local communities in the municipalities
where it has power plants.
We take local communities into account in power plant maintenance and
improvement work, and we meet with local residents at open-house days at the
plants, for example. Fortum is also an important employer at the local level. W e
are a significant tax payer in our operating areas, and our investments improve
the local infrastructure.
Examples of Fortum activities with local communities in 2012:
•In Finland and Sweden, Fortum’ s Environmental Fund supported
projects to reduce the adverse environmental impacts of hydropower
production and to promote biodiversity in built-up water systems. The
company collaborates with local authorities, fishermen and
environmental organisations. In a number of projects , river basins are
being restored and habitats for fish and freshwater pearl mussels are
being improved.
•After the winter storm in December 201 1, we met with our customers at
town hall-style meetings held in municipalities that had suf fered the
worst storm damage in Fortum’ s network area. The topics discussed at
the events included management of the storm situation, compensation
procedures and improvements to be made in the future. With the
VahvaV erkko project launched after the storm, we are improving
delivery reliability of electricity distribution and reinforcing the electricity
network in many dif ferent ways. The progress of the project was
presented to local residents at monthly meetings around Finland and
through direct mail and local media.
•In the flooding of the Oulujoki river in Finland we inspected areas of
damage reported by local residents and agreed upon joint projects to
repair the damages.
•Loviisa nuclear power plant published a stakeholder magazine called
Naapurina voimala (Power plant as a neighbour) and held regular
discussions with the representatives of the city of Loviisa, Finland.
•In the past two years Fortum has engaged in an active dialogue with
local authorities, politicians and organisations in France about
hydropower development.
•Fortum is involved in a variety of lighting projects in cities and
municipalities. The company funds the planning and construction of
energy-ef ficient lighting for sites voted on by local residents. The
projects were implemented in Lohja and Espoo in Finland and at two
sites in Stockholm, Sweden.
In Finland and
Sweden, Fortum’ s

expectations
Fortum annually measures customer and stakeholder satisfaction
as well as development of the company's reputation and the factors
that impact it through the extensive One Fortum survey .
The survey covers customers, governmental bodies, capital markets, non-
governmental organisations and opinion leaders as well as Fortum's personnel. In
2012, the survey was conducted in Finland, Sweden, Norway , Poland, the Baltic
countries and Russia. For the Power Division, the survey also covered customers
in Germany and Great Britain. In Finland and Sweden, the survey covered the
general public as well. In 2012, Russia's public administration and heat customers
were new target groups included in the survey . In addition, Fortum monitors
customer satisfaction through regular EPSI customer satisfaction surveys in
Finland, Sweden and Norway .
The survey results are examined by Fortum's top management, and they are
used for planning and development of the company's business.
Fortum's reputation clearly improved
The One Fortum survey results indicate that, compared to the 201 1 results,
Fortum's reputation has developed favourably in all stakeholder groups, except
customers. Fortum has the strongest reputation within the capital markets and the
weakest amongst the general public. According to the 2012 results, development
has been most favourable amongst non-governmental organisations and opinion
leaders. The results also clearly improved amongst personnel and the general
public. Fortum's reputation amongst customers in Finland was slightly weaker
than before, which also af fects the overall rating received from the customer
target group. The survey indicates that customer satisfaction has improved
significantly amongst the ESD Division's business customers. For other
customers, satisfaction has remained at the previous year's level.
In 2012, as in the previous year , Fortum's leadership, operations and financial
performance were given high scores. In social responsibility , last year's focus
area, results improved significantly amongst all stakeholder groups. The results of
two other development areas, customer orientation and Fortum as an employer ,
also improved compared to 201 1. All three areas continue to be important targets
of development for the company's operations.

Personnel: Krzysztof Karolczyk, Fortum Poland
"I have been working for Fortum since 2004 when I started as a sustainability
trainee. For the last three years, I was the Head of Sustainability in Poland, and
since December 2012, I've been a CHP plant development manager . In my
opinion, Fortum is an employer with many opportunities for career development.
Job rotation and competence development processes create diverse
opportunities for employees who want to expand their expertise."
Customer: Kim Särs, Director of Real Estate, LähiT apiola
Kiinteistövarainhoito
"The business centre complex in T apiola, Espoo owned by Kiinteistö-T apiola will
be connected to Fortum's district heating and cooling network. The solutions used
must be sustainable and represent new concepts and technology . Fortum and
district cooling were preferred also because of the aesthetic and maintenance-
free aspects of the solution. With Fortum's solution, we get one-stop shopping for
the entire service. The operational reliability and the more even indoor air
temperature that district cooling brings will also improve the customer comfort."
Fortum has extensive experience in district cooling and the company has been
involved in developing one of the world's largest district cooling solutions in
Stockholm.
Minister for International Development and state
ownership steering issues: Heidi Hautala
"Responsibility is the key to success for all companies today . I am glad that
sustainability is directly at the core of Fortum's strategy . Fortum is an important
player in the energy sector also globally , so Fortum has good prerequisites to
make solutions for sustainable energy use available to an increasing number of
people. As a Minister , I hope that Fortum will actively express its needs related to
the promotion of sustainability also to the state authorities.
Fortum is a strategically important company for the Finnish State. Securing
energy supply is naturally an important national interest. Fortum is also an
important source of revenue for the State, because about half of the dividends
received by the State come specifically from Fortum."Jesper Peterson:

"ARMZ Uranium Holding Co., a mining division of Russian State Atomic Energy
Corporation ROSA TOM, is one of the top three uranium-mining companies by
production and ranked second in terms of mineral-resource base.
The uranium produced by ARMZ enterprises located in Russia is used in the
fabrication of the fuel supplied to the Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant (NPP).
Representatives from Fortum, which operates the NPP , visited three ARMZ
enterprises. Thus they assessed uranium production technology in terms of
sustainable development and environmental impact.
In 2012, JSC Dalur , part of the management structure of ARMZ Uranium Holding
Co., was granted ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System certification and
ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management System certification. Our objective
is to obtain certification for other Russian enterprises and create a company-wide

Cooperation with Fortum is facilitating implementation of these plans."
Supplier: Biofuel supplier in Brazil, Óleos Pirapora
”For us, the audit conducted by Fortum was a big help and useful because it
provided us with improvement suggestions. The audit was also beneficial for our
employees, and Fortum’ s way of doing the audit with direct interviews enabled
better understanding and commitment.”
We assess the level of operations of our business partners through pre-selection
and supplier audits. W e started sustainability-related audits of service and goods
suppliers in 2012. One of the suppliers we audited during the year was our
Brazilian biofuel supplier .
Partner: John Liljelund, A W-Energy
"Despite Europe's weakening economic situation, investments in so far
unexploited renewable energy technologies have remained substantial. The wave
energy sector is moving from pilot projects towards commercial projects, and our
WaveRoller technology is one of the absolute best in the sector . The commitment
of industrial partners, energy companies and politicians is vitally important in the
commercialisation phase.
For A W-Energy , the collaboration with big industrial players and institutional
investors has not only increased financial security , it has also accelerated contact
establishment with important stakeholders. A good example of this has been the
collaboration with the energy company Fortum. Fortum's established position
combined with the pioneering W aveRoller technology has paved the way to new
projects."

"It is becoming clearer than ever that nuclear power and fossil based energy are
not viable options. There are problems with the final disposal of nuclear waste
and risks associated with uranium mining. The serious climate situation requires
rapid changes and strong measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is
time to choose a path and the SSNC believes that the future energy system
needs to be based on renewable energy sources with a strong focus on energy
efficiency .
The SSNC is happy that Fortum sells the SSNC’ s own eco-labelled electricity
”Good Environmental Choice”. Choosing this electricity helps to reduce
environmental impact as well as rectify the damage that renewable energy
production causes .Companies selling eco-labelled electricity based on
hydroelectric power also have to allocate money to an environmental fund.
Fortum has worked actively with their environment fund and funded a number of
environmental projects, approved by the SSNC. This work is important and shows
the way to sustainable energy ."

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Sustainability management
Fortum aims for a balanced management of economic, environmental and social responsibility in the Group's operations.
Sustainability management is strategy-driven and is based on the company's values , the Code of Conduct , and the policies and
their specifying guidelines defined at the Group level. W e comply with laws and regulations. All of our operations are guided by
good governance , effective risk management , adequate controls and the internal audit principles supporting them.
Guiding policies and international commitments
In 2012, Fortum defined and harmonised its Group-level policies. The renewed policies require the Board's approval, and the
approval procedure is scheduled for spring 2013. Fortum's renewed policies will be publicly presented on Fortum's website after the
Board's approval. Our main policies and guidelines supporting sustainability include:
•Code of Conduct
•Supplier Code of Conduct
•Sustainability policy (including environmental, and occupational health and safety policies)
•Human resources policy
•Group risk policy
•Sponsorship steering document
•Group manual on investment evaluation and approval procedure
•Group instructions on Competition Law
•Group instructions on anti-corruption and anti-bribery
•Group instructions for safeguarding Fortum's assets
•Group instructions for conflicts of interest
•Biodiversity guidelines
Fortum respects and supports the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child, and the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Additionally , Fortum recognises in its
operations the statutes of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the International Chamber of Commerce's anti-bribery
and anti-corruption guidelines, and the Bettercoal initiative's Code on responsible coal mining. Fortum has been a member of the
UN Global Compact initiative since June 2010.
Management approach to economic responsibility
Fortum's economic responsibility emphasises strong financial performance, profitable growth and added value over the long term. A
company that is financially strong is able to be responsible for the environment, take care of its personnel, meet the needs of its
customers, support the development of society and produce added value for its dif ferent stakeholders. Strong financial performance
and growth must be achieved in compliance with sustainability principles and the company's target setting. Every new research and
development project is assessed against carbon dioxide-free and resource ef ficiency criteria. Likewise, every new investment
proposal is assessed against sustainability criteria as part of Fortum's investment evaluation and approval procedure.
Fortum's key financial figures are prepared and presented in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Fortum uses the information presented in the financial statements as well as the applicable Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
indicators for reporting economic responsibility and discloses in its Sustainability Report some figures that are collected as part of
the financial statement process, but are not included in the actual financial statements .

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Management approach to environmental responsibility
Environmental responsibility at Fortum emphasises the ef ficient use of natural resources and the need to mitigate climate change,
and highlights our know-how in CO 2-free hydro and nuclear power production and in energy-ef ficient CHP production. Research
and development activities create requisites for environmentally benign energy solutions.
Fortum's environmental management is based on the Group's policies and commitments as well as the international ISO 14001
standard; the goal is for all operative functions to have ISO 14001 environmental certification. At the end of 2012, the certification
rate of Fortum's operations was 95% . Sullom V oe's operations in Great Britain were certified in 2012. OAO Fortum's operations in
Russia received ISO 14001 certification in August 2012. Preparations for certification of OAO Fortum's district heat network
operations continued during the year . The certification rate is based on the share of sales generated in certified operations (2012
net sales values) out of Fortum's total sales.

Management approach to occupational health and safety
Fortum's safety management emphasises the company's strategic intent to create a safe workplace for all individuals working in
Fortum's operations. W e believe that all work injuries are preventable. Safety management is based on the Group's policies and
commitments as well as Group-level guidelines and Group-defined minimum requirements for environmental and occupational
health and safety work. Fortum's goal is for all operative functions to have OHSAS 18001, occupational health and safety
certification.
At the end of 2012, the certification rate of Fortum's operations was 70% . In January 2012, certification was awarded to Fortum
Jelgava, which represents 95% of the operations in Latvia. Measures to obtain certification for the Russia Division's operations in
2012 continued. OAO Fortum passed the certification audit in December 2012. The Electricity Solutions and Distribution (ESD)
Division does not have OHSAS 18001 certification.
In reporting injuries, Fortum complies with the principles of the United States Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA)
and the ILO's Practice on Recording and Notification of Occupational Accidents and Diseases (1995) to the extent that they conform
to the legislation in Fortum's countries of operation.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Sustainability organisation and responsibilities
At Fortum, responsibility for issues related to sustainability lies with division and Group function management, and ultimately the
President and CEO and the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has not appointed any of its members specifically
conversant in sustainability and thus relies on the information and expert statements provided by the Fortum Management T eam
and the Group's sustainability experts. Fortum's corporate governance is discussed in the 2012 Financial Statements .
The Corporate Sustainability unit, which has been part of the Finance function since 1 November 2012, is responsible for
coordinating and developing sustainability at the Group level. The Finance function also includes the Legal, Risk, Mergers and
Acquisitions, Strategy , Purchasing and Internal Audit units, which the Sustainability unit closely collaborates with. Also the
cooperation with the Communications and Corporate Relations and Public Af fairs units is part of everyday activities.The Chief
Financial Of ficer reports to the CEO and is a member of the Fortum Management T eam. The CFO also participates in Fortum's
Board meetings.
The Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for the operations of the Group's sustainability networks. Regularly operating
networks include the Climate network, which convened 5 times in 2012, and the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) network,
which met 6 times. As of January 1, 2013, the working model of the networks has been renewed and made more ef ficient by
combining the Climate and EHS networks. Corporate Sustainability gives sustainability approval (environmental, occupational
health, safety and social impacts) for all significant investments, acquisitions and divestments as part of Fortum's investment
evaluation and approval procedure.
At Fortum, the responsibility of line management is emphasised. Fortum's line management is responsible for environmental and
safety management, and the realisation of targets is part of Fortum's incentive system. The main indicators in defining incentive pay
are injury frequency , the number of fires, leaks and other non-compliances. Sustainability targets are also part of the short-term
incentive programme.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Reporting principles
Fortum's Annual Report consists of two parts: the Financials and the integrated Sustainability Report. The theme for reporting is
"Adding value". The entire Annual Report will be published online in Finnish and English on Fortum's website.
This report reviews Fortum's operations in 2012 and also contains some information from January-February 2013. The 201 1
Sustainability Report was published in April 2012, and the 2013 report will be published in April 2014.
The report structure is divided into six sections. The first section describes Fortum as a company and provides key information in
terms of production capacity , customers, personnel, certified management systems and carbon-dioxide emissions. The Group's
business structure by division and a summary of the key achievements in 2012 are also presented. The second section focuses on
Fortum's strategy and sustainability's core role in it, as well as on market development. Fortum's business value chain and the role
of dif ferent production and distribution forms in it are discussed in the third section of the report. Fortum's key stakeholder groups
and their expectations about Fortum's sustainability work are discussed in the fourth section. The standard disclosures of the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines are presented in the fifth section. The report's case examples are in the sixth section.
Individuals providing more information related to the report can be found on the contacts page .
Report scope and boundary
Reporting related to operations and management covers all functions under Fortum’ s control, including subsidiaries in all countries
of operation. The consolidation includes the parent company Fortum Corporation and all the companies in which Fortum
Corporation has the power to govern the financial and operating policies and in which it generally holds, directly or indirectly , more
than 50% of the voting rights. Possible deviations to this principle are reported in conjunction with information applying dif ferent
boundaries.
The reporting of management practices does not fully cover Fortum’ s minority ownerships, and thus the defining of the scope of
reporting is not fully compliant with the GRI Boundary Protocol. According to the GRI Boundary Protocol, entities with 50%
ownership or less and with significant sustainability impacts should be included in the management approach disclosures. In
Fortum’ s case, management practices of the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant (26% ownership), Kemijoki Oy (18% ownership in equity
capital, 64% ownership in hydropower shares) and T urun Seudun Maakaasu ja Energiantuotanto Oy (49.5% ownership) in Finland
and the management practices of the Forsmark (26% ownership) and Oskarshamn (46% ownership) nuclear power plants in
Sweden are excluded from the reporting.
Information from previous years is presented as pro forma information, i.e., presented on the basis of the organisation and the
functions of each year; the impacts of ownership changes in production facilities, for example, have not been updated afterwards in
the previous key indicators.
Capacity changes
New and acquired capacity
Capacity and assets acquired during the year are included in the reporting starting from the date of possession. The same applies
to the new capacity built and the new assets commissioned during the year .

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/Leased and divested capacity
The Kirkniemi power plant’ s capacity was leased out for the entire period when it was in Fortum's ownership. Ownership of the
power plant was transferred to Sappi Fine Paper Europe on 15 November 2012. The production and emissions of the leased
capacity are not included in Fortum’ s specific emissions figures, in order to present an accurate view on emissions in relation to
production. However , the Kirkniemi power plant has been included in the absolute emissions figures until 15 November .
The business and environmental permits of the Naantali power plant were transferred in the beginning of 2012 to the responsibility
of Turun Seudun Maakaasu ja Energiantuotanto Oy . During January , Fortum also completed the divestments of Fortum
Energiaratkaisut Oy and the small-scale hydropower plants in Finland and the divestment of Fortum T ermest AS and Fortum Elekter
AS in Estonia. In 2012, Fortum also sold small-scale hydropower plants in Sweden and its district heat network in Surgut, Russia.
These functions are not included in the 2012 sustainability reporting.
Measurement and calculation principles
Data for economic performance indicators is collected from the audited financial statements and from financial accounting and
consolidation systems.
The environmental information of the report covers the plants for which Fortum is the legal holder of the environmental permit.
Normally , Fortum is the majority shareholder of such plants, but the company can be the holder of a plant’ s environmental permit
also when it is a minority shareholder . In such cases, the plant information is reported in its entirety , but only the share of production
and emissions corresponding to Fortum’ s share of ownership is calculated in the specific emissions figures.
Fortum utilises a Group-wide database with instructions for collecting site-level environmental, health and safety data. Sites are
responsible for data input, emissions calculations and assurance. The Corporate Sustainability unit compiles all data and is
responsible for published sustainability information.
Fortum’ s CO 2emissions subject to the EU Emissions T rading Scheme are annually verified at the site-level by external verifiers.
Direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions have been reported in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and based on
the Greenhouse Gas Analysis performed by an external consultant.
Fortum’ s human resources (HR) management system HeRMeS is currently used in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Poland,
excluding the Zabrze and Bytom functions, and it is the main system for all employee-related personal and job data. Other social
responsibility data, such as occupational health-related data, originates from various source systems and is collected by the
relevant contact persons and delivered to Corporate Sustainability in the format recommended by GRI.
Global Compact reporting
Fortum has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact initiative since June 2010. This report describes the realisation of
the Global Compact’ s ten principles in Fortum’ s operations. Global Compact approves the use of the indicators in the GRI G3.1
Guidelines in Communication on Progress (COP) reporting. The GRI index presents the indicators used to measure Fortum’ s
performance in fulfilling the principles of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption.

EC2 Financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organisation's
activities due to climate change
Climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks as well as opportunities for Fortum. As energy production and use is the
largest source of greenhouse gases, the energy sector has a central role in building a low-carbon future. The energy industry has
established visions and roadmaps of the future energy system and is prepared to invest in new climate-benign production capacity ,
provided that the supporting policy framework and preconditions of society are in place.
The primary impact of climate regulation for Fortum is the price of carbon dioxide in the EU's emissions trading and the cost arising
from it. This also determines the financial value for the reduction of emissions. The price of CO 2increases the production cost of
fossil-based energy , but it also raises the prices of energy products. The best way to reduce the risk related to the price of carbon
dioxide is to increase CO 2-free and low-carbon production capacity . Fortum is continuously developing its energy production
capacity and looking for opportunities to reduce emissions. In 2012, the focus was on power plant energy-ef ficiency measures.
In 2012, about 93% of Fortum's electricity production in the EU was CO 2-free. In 2012, Fortum had a total of 79 (201 1: 102) plants
in six member states within the EU's emissions trading scheme. About 95% of the CO 2emissions in the EU area were included in
the emissions trading system. In 2012, Fortum was granted 5.4 million tonnes in free emissions allowances. The company's
emissions in the EU emissions trading scheme were 4.8 million tonnes. Thus, in terms of emissions allowances, Fortum showed a
surplus.
Fortum's CO 2emissions and emissions allowances in 2010-2012
Million tonnes 2012 2011 2010
Total emissions 20.7 23.5 25.3
Emissions subject to ETS 4.8 8.0 9.7
Free emissions allocation 5.4 6.8 5.6
Emissions in Russia 15.6 14.7 14.6
In the third ETS period, 2013–2020, the volume of Fortum's free emissions allowances will decrease significantly , because
electricity production has to purchase allowances from the market or auctions. Only in Poland and the Baltic countries will Fortum's
CHP plants receive free allowances also for electricity production on the basis of the derogation rules of the Emissions T rading
Directive.
In Russia, Fortum's CO 2emissions are growing in upcoming years as a result of the increased energy production capacity . In
Russia, carbon dioxide emissions have economic value for now only through the Joint Implementation (JI) mechanism. The
mechanism could be utilised only during the Kyoto period 2008–2012, but not beyond that. Fortum received the first emission
reduction units (ERU) in October from Russia. These ERUs originated from OAO Fortum's new power plant unit at T yumen CHP-1.
A total of 1,626,949 ERUs had been transferred from Russia to Finland by the end of 2012 from the Jl projects in which Fortum
participated directly . Fortum doesn't expect to receive significant volumes of ERUs in 2013.
Fortum is also participating in two international climate funds, the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) and the T esting Ground Facility
(TGF). In 2012, Fortum received a total 127,360 emission reduction units from these funds. Of the emission reduction units

Fortum estimates to receive a
cumulative total of about 1,500,000 units during the fund's operating period.
Fortum is exposed to physical risks of climate change, including changes in weather patterns that may change energy demand and
supply from, e.g., hydropower plants. More frequent and intensive storms may impact the operation and maintenance of the
distribution network. Higher precipitation may af fect hydropower production, dam safety and bioenergy supply . In addition to climate
change mitigation, Fortum is also taking measures to adapt its operations to climate change and to take impacts into consideration
in e.g. production planning and in evaluating growth projects.
Concern about climate change is expected to result in an increasing demand for low-carbon and energy-ef ficient energy products
and solutions . Fortum's know-how in CO 2-free hydro and nuclear power and in energy-ef ficient CHP as well as research and
development in the future energy system and technologies, like wave and solar energy , can prove to be a competitive advantage.
Fortum is investing in CO 2-free production in Europe and sees business opportunities in providing climate-benign energy solutions
for sustainable urban living and the electrification of transport.

Market presence
EC6 Policy , practices and spending on local suppliers
Fortum buys fuels, goods and services from international and local suppliers. A significant part of Fortum's procurements are related
to investments. Fortum classifies purchases as local for those countries in which Fortum has operations. The most significant
purchases, excluding investments, are from the Nordic countries (EUR 1,612 million) and Russia (EUR 769 million).
Fuels accounted for about EUR 1,057 million of the total annual purchasing volume. Fossil fuels accounted for about EUR 910
million, biofuels about EUR 130 million and nuclear fuel about EUR 20 million.

The biggest investments were
made in Russia, EUR 568 million (201 1: 670), and in Sweden, EUR 492 million (201 1: 392). Investments in renewable energy forms
were EUR 429 million (201 1: 247).
EC7 Local hiring procedures and proportions of local senior management
In local hiring, Fortum uses advertised recruitment and direct search methods. In Sweden, 100% of the senior management are
locals. In addition to the locals, in Finland there is one Polish manager and in Russia one German manager . In Poland, the only V ice
President position is held by a Finn.
Indirect impacts
EC8 Development and impact of infrastructure investments and services provided
primarily for public benefit, through commercial in-kind or pro bono engagement
Fortum supports organisations and communities working for the common good in the countries where it operates . The goal is for
sponsorships to be mutually beneficial. Collaboration in research and development projects with Nordic universities in particular is
significant.
In 2012, Fortum's support for public benefit totalled about EUR 5.8 million (201 1: 4.6), of which the share of grants awarded by the
Fortum Foundation was EUR 780,000 (201 1: 700,000). The purpose of the Fortum Foundation is to support research, education
and development in natural, technical and economical sciences within the energy industry .In 2012, Fortum Foundation granted
scholarships to 48 students. In addition to this, Fortum donated about EUR 757,000 (201 1: 2.8 million) to universities in Finland for
R&D cooperation.
Fortum's investments in infrastructure – especially in the districting heating network in Russia – provide public benefits. However , as
Fortum's investments in district heating networks have also economic and environmental benefits, they are not regarded as the
investments referred to in the GRI.
The amount donated to non-profit targets is decided by Fortum's Board of Directors. Donations are not awarded for any kind of
political activities, religious organisations, authorities, municipalities or local administrations, nor are they ever part of business
agreements.
EC9 Understanding and describing significant indirect economic impacts, including the
extent of impacts
Fortum supports social development and well-being by , e.g., increasing local employment and paying taxes, salaries and social
security costs . The tax benefits Fortum produces for society include income taxes and taxes related to the business operations –
such as property and fuel taxes. Fortum also has pass-through taxes, such as the value added tax, and withholding taxes, which
Fortum is obligated to collect and report on behalf of the government.
The dividend income on the shares of the Finnish State has an impact on maintaining social infrastructure.

Fortum's indirect energy consumption in 2012 was 5.8 TWh. The largest part of this is electricity and heat acquired from external
sources for operating power plants and compensating network losses in power distribution.
A major part of the external heat originates from the Enocell pulp mill in Finland and is produced from biomass. Electricity is bought
from various suppliers and the exact primary energy sources are not known. Guarantees of origin (CO 2-free electricity) were
acquired for all the electricity for network losses.
External energy purchases have been converted to primary energy by assuming 75% energy ef ficiency for power production and
85% energy ef ficiency for heat production.

EN5 Energy saved due to conservation and efficiency improvements
In combustion-based energy production, Fortum aims to utilise the fuel as ef ficiently as possible. In 2012, Fortum's ef ficiency of fuel
use was 64.2% (201 1: 67.1%), while the corresponding target is 70% as a five-year average.
Energy-ef ficient CHP production , in which up to 90% of the energy content of the fuel can be utilised, is Fortum's most important
tool to increase the ef ficiency of fuel use. In 2012, CHP plants accounted for 32% (201 1: 29%) of Fortum's total electricity production
and 79% (201 1: 71%) of heat production.
The implementation of the energy analyses, energy-ef ficiency training and technology measures related to Fortum Power and Heat
Oy's 2008–2016 energy-ef ficiency programme continued in 2012. The goal of the programme is to improve energy ef ficiency in
power plants in Sweden, Finland and Great Britain by 600 GWh per year . The main focus is on improving power plant ef ficiency and
on increasing the capacity of CO 2-free production. About 30 projects will be implemented every year . In 2012, the ef ficiency
improvements resulted in an energy savings of about 95 GWh (201 1: 90 GWh).
Hydropower refurbishment projects were completed in Pyhäkoski, Finland, and Bergvik, Sweden, and continued at the
Gammalänge and Långå power plants in Sweden. A tool for monitoring operational energy ef ficiency in real-time was developed in
2012 for the Suomenoja and Joensuu power plants, and an Ecotuning™ energy ef ficiency report was compiled at the Kuusamo
plant. Additionally , the optimisation of the district heat networks continued in Stockholm.
Fortum is participating in the European electricity sector's Energy Wisdom programme and reports on its projects that improve
energy ef ficiency and reduce greenhouse gases. The Energy Wisdom reports are available at www .eurelectric.org/EWP .

consumption metering devices (e.g. Kotinäyttö/Home Display).
EN7 Initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption and reductions achieved
Own use of energy in a power plant can be reduced with structural modifications, systematic and preventive maintenance, and by
training personnel in the optimal operation and monitoring of the plant's operational economy .
Fortum has invested in automatic meter management in power distribution in Sweden and Finland in recent years. This improves
the quality of loss data and creates new possibilities for load management, which in turn reduces distribution losses. Losses in
power distribution can also be reduced by optimising network operations, increasing transmission capacity in lines with the highest
loads and replacing obsolete transformers with new , more energy ef ficient ones. The impact of an individual measure is often minor
and even the cumulative impacts can only be seen over the longer term. However ,in the long term the network load tends to grow ,
which makes quantification of energy ef ficiency very dif ficult.
Fortum's power distribution losses in 2012 were 1,432 GWh, which is a little higher than in the previous year (201 1: 1,401 GWh). In
2012, the losses accounted for 3.3% (201 1: 3.3%) of total power distribution volume. The volume of power distribution increased to
26.6 TWh (201 1: 26.1 TWh) and the volume of regional power transmission to 17.3 TWh (201 1: 16.7 TWh).
Thevolume of electricity acquired from external sources for operating power plants and heat boilers was 962 GWh, which is 1%
less than in the previous year (2011: 969 GWh).
Water
EN8 T otal water withdrawal by source
In 2012, Fortum abstracted a total of 3,680 (201 1: 3,850) million cubic meters of water , of which the majority ,3,580 million m3(2011:
3,750) , was used as cooling water in thermal power plants. Direct sea water cooling is applied at the condensing power plants in
Finland. When cooling water flows through the condenser , its temperature rises, but the volume of water remains unchanged.
Fortum's power plants in Russia use cooling towers where part of the water is evaporated into the atmosphere. In Russia, water is
used also for pumping ash from coal-fired power plants into ash ponds.
In hydropower production, all the water runs through turbines, so the water volume and quality remain unchanged. Hydropower
production is not included in the above mentioned figures for water withdrawal.

Fortum withdraws water from the sea, lake or river , and the withdrawn volume is small compared to the watercourse volume and
flow, thus none of these water sources is significantly af fected. W ater scarcity is not an issue in the operation areas of Fortum’ s
power plants.
In Poland, Fortum uses mainly municipal tap water . Poland is Fortum’ s only area of operation defined as a water-stressed area.
Fortum’ s power and heat plants in Poland are mostly small. The aggregated water consumption is about 800,000 m3annually . No
risk of shortage in the municipal water supplies has been identified in the cities in which Fortum operates. All of our operations in
water-stressed areas have ISO 14001 environmental certification.
EN10 Percentage and total volume of water recycled and reused
The volume of water recycled in 2012 was 9.5 million m3, which was 10% of the process water intake.
Biodiversity
EN11 Location and size of land holdings in areas of high biodiversity
Fortum owns and operates several energy production facilities adjacent to protected areas. Eight protected areas in a total of about
10,500 hectares are located within 500 metres from Fortum's Finnish power plants. The areas consist of natural conservation
programme areas, nature and wilderness conservation areas, and Natura 2000 areas. In Sweden, there are 37 dif ferent types of
conservation areas in a total of about 40,000 hectares within the same distance from power plants. A more comprehensive list of
the areas that are close to conservation areas and in Fortum's possession is available here .
In Finland, the areas close to power plants are protected mainly for their scenic values. Fortum's real estate at the Untra
hydropower plant on the Dalälven river in Sweden contains Natura 2000 areas, and there is also a large conservation and Natura
2000 area located directly downstream from the plant. Outside of this conservation area, Fortum has voluntarily protected the area
in its ownership. There are conservation areas also in the vicinity of other power plants. In the Eura municipality in Finland, the
Kauttua power plant is located near the Haronlahti Natura 2000 area. In Stockholm county in Sweden, there are conservation areas
located close to five of Fortum's CHP plants.

This is an automatically generated PDF document of Fortum’ s online Annual Report and may not be as comprehensive as the complete Annual Report, which is available at http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/EN12 Description of significant impacts of activities, products, and services on
biodiversity
Fortum's impacts on biodiversity – flora and fauna species – are often local and mainly linked to the use of land and water areas
and the exploitation of renewable energy sources. Fortum's activities in hydropower production and electricity distribution may have
a negative impact in areas of high biodiversity . In some cases, the impacts of hydropower production are related to dams, which
prevent fish migration and reduce the number of rapids as habitats. Fortum's discharge waters into water systems, particularly
cooling and runof f waters have only a minor impact on water systems and the related habitats and aquatic biodiversity .
Utilising fuels (for example, peat and biomass) in heat production can af fect biodiversity . Fortum does not have its own fuel
production, so there is no direct impact on biodiversity . Biodiversity aspects are taken into consideration in fuel purchasing.
EN13 Habitats protected or restored
The first phase of restoration of Kiantajärvi lake's flood meadows in Finland was implemented by creating nesting areas for birds in
collaboration with the Centre for Economic Development, T ransport and the Environment (EL Y) and the municipality . Removing the
Nimisjärvi dam created habitats for fish and benthos. The impact on the landscape in the area was considered to be good, but the
effects on birds, flora and aquatic fauna can be assessed only after a few years after restoration.
In Sweden, two dams on Ore river tributaries were removed and thus bringing access to migrating fish. The impacts of the measure
will be monitored in 2013. In the vicinity of the Untra power plant on the Dalälven river , Fortum manages the company's forests in an
area of 260 hectares in line with the environmental management plan to protect the very rich biodiversity in the area. Continuous
use of environmentally benign forest management practices will be monitored with ecological surveys.
Fortum has also made a feasibility study on possible fish restoration measures downstream from the Krångede hydro power plant.
Habitat modelling was carried out in the same area to study possible spawning areas and habitats suitable for graylings and
restoration possibilities. However , no decision on habitat restorations has been made because additional studies are still needed.

EN14 Managing impacts on biodiversity
Fortum's biodiversity guidelines set the principles for taking biodiversity into consideration and for managing the impacts of the
company's operations on biodiversity . Fortum recognises that biodiversity is an essential element of sustainable development on a
global and local scale.
The main impacts on biodiversity are assessed in the pre-feasibility phase of any project, e.g., a hydropower project, before the
investment decision. Biodiversity impacts are assessed in depth as part of the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) process. If
an investment project impacts a specific species, it may result in modification to the plant design or in the initiation of measures to
preserve or restore the ecological value.
For example, a dam safety project to retrofit the Untra hydropower plant dam to withstand calculated design flood flows will be
implemented in the coming years. T ogether with biology experts, Fortum has carried out a thorough study and has agreed on
modifications that will decrease local impacts.
Fortum compensates for the environmental impacts caused by its hydropower production by stocking several fish species. W ork on
biodiversity action plans for hydropower production is under way . In 2013, river-specific plans on environmental measures will be
completed.
Fortum's Environmental Fund supports projects that reduce the adverse environmental impacts of hydropower production and
support biodiversity in built-up water systems. Some of the Fund's assets originate from the sales of "EKOenergia" electricity in
Finland and "Good Environmental Choice" eco-labelled electricity in Sweden. Additionally , the Fund also contains other voluntary

In 2012, the Fund spent about EUR 770,000 on various projects. All projects are
typically carried out in cooperation with authorities, municipalities and research institutes. Read more about the projects
implemented in 2012 .
In electricity network operations , underground cabling protects biodiversity and reduces the impact on the landscape and birds.
Measures to prevent bird collisions and electric shocks include isolation of the live parts of the network and mounting marker balls
on overhead lines and landing perches on poles. Whenever possible, new networks are constructed in public areas and along road
sides.
In biomass and biofuel purchases, Fortum aims to increase the share of certified wood fuel. This kind of fuel originates from
sustainable energy sources in which e.g. biodiversity is taken into consideration. Read more about Fortum's activities to increase
the traceability and sustainability of bioenergy .
EN15 Species with extinction risk with habitats in areas affected by operations
Fortum has not conducted a comprehensive study on the presence of species with extinction risk in the vicinity of its operating
areas, but is continuously increasing the awareness of the endangered species in the vicinity of its power plants.
Saimaa ringed seal ( Pusa hispida saimensis ) is classified in Finland as an extremely endangered species on the IUCN's red list.
Fortum has long been working to protect this species with the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation. There have been a few
years when Fortum has altered water flows in the V uoksi river to enhance the survival of seal calves in their nests. The Saimaa
ringed seal is an example of a species on which Fortum's activities have a positive impact.
One important threatened species in Finnish and Swedish rivers is the freshwater pearl mussel. Several projects related to
restoration of the mussel habitat will be implemented within the framework of Fortum's Environmental Fund in 2013. Fortum also
funds Karlstad University's research project that is producing information about the freshwater pearl mussel reproduction and the
significance of the origin of the mussel's host fish (trout) on the life-cycle of mussels.
A threatened sedge species, Carex heleonaste , grows close to the Laforsen hydropower plant on the Ljusnan river in Sweden. T o
protect this threatened species, annual maintenance work is carried out to ensure good living conditions for this species.
In Sweden, Fortum is participating in an eel ( Anguilla anguilla ) conservation project and research together with seven hydropower
companies and the Swedish Agency for Marine and W ater Management (Havs och vattenmyndigheten).

EN16 T otal direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions
Carbon dioxide (CO 2)
In 2012, Fortum emitted 20.7 million (201 1: 23.5) tonnes of CO 2. Of this amount, 76% resulted from the Russian operations, 12%
from Finland and 5% from Poland. Fortum's total emissions decreased from the previous year , mainly because Naantali Power
Plant was assigned to T urun Seudun Maakaasu ja Energiantuotanto Oy and only a small volume of coal condensing power was
produced in Finland. Emissions in Russia increased by 0.9 million tonnes from 201 1.
The specific CO 2emission of total energy production decreased to 177 g/kWh (201 1: 192). The five-year average, including 2012,
increased to 179 g/kWh (201 1: 169) as a consequence of the increased share of Russian energy production in the total mix and
increased emissions in Russia. The specific CO 2emission from total energy production has been increasing during the last five
years, although we still are below the target level. The increase in the specific emission is a result of the increased share of our
Russian energy production based on natural gas and coal.

Total greenhouse gas emissions
Fortum reports greenhouse gases in accordance with the principles of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol recommended by the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI), where emissions are categorised into scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. The reporting covers
direct and indirect CO 2, methane (CH 4) and dinitrogen oxide (N 2O) emissions. Indirect emissions are calculated using literature-
based emission factors and assumptions on dif ferent parts of the fuel chains. In the beginning of 2013 we started a development
process regarding the revised Corporate V alue Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting -standard and we aim to disclose a
greenhouse gas inventory meeting the new standard during 2013.
In 2012, about 80% of Fortum's greenhouse gas emissions were direct CO 2emissions (scope 1), which are generated when
burning fossil fuels to produce electricity and heat. Additionally , the direct emissions include the CO 2emissions of company cars.
The share of indirect emissions from electricity , heat and steam purchased from outside sources (scope 2) was less than 1% of all
greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect emissions from the production and transportation of fuels, from employee air travel and from the
use of our products (scope 3) accounted for about 19% of greenhouse gas emissions.
The share of carbon dioxide of CO 2equivalent emissions was about 88% and the share of other greenhouse gases (CH 4and N 2O)
was about 12%.

SF6is used as isolation gas in switchgears at a number of substations located in urban areas. SF 6is a strong greenhouse gas, but
the gas volume is low and the gas is well confined in the equipment. In 2012, about 24 kg of SF 6was leaked into the atmosphere
from Fortum's installations. This equals to 540 tonnes of CO 2emissions.
EN18 Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
New CO 2-free and low-carbon capacity
Fortum's most important measure in curbing climate change is to increase CO 2-free or low-carbon energy production and to
improve energy ef ficiency .
In line with its strategy , Fortum is focusing on CO 2-free hydro andnuclear power and on energy-ef ficient combined heat and power
(CHP) production. Emissions trading and the use of Kyoto mechanisms are also important climate actions at Fortum.
New CO 2-free and low-carbon production capacity commissioned during 2012 is described inInvestments in 2012 .
With its low-carbon production capacity , Fortum's Power Division has managed to reduce its electricity production's specific CO 2
emissions by 60% from the 2003–2007 comparison period for the Kyoto period 2008–2012.
Increasing the use of biomass
Increasing the use of bioenergy was studied at many power plants during 2012. At the Värtan power plant, testing of the use of olive
stones in the fuel mix continued and their share of the fuel use was 4%. At the Czestochowa CHP plant in Poland, the share of
biomass in fuel use increased from 22% to 32% during 2012.
In February 2012, Fortum made a decision on a pyrolysis plant to be built at the Joensuu CHP plant . The plant will produce 50,000
tonnes (corresponding to 200–220 GWh of fuel energy) of bio-oil annually , and it will be the first commercial-scale demonstration
plant on pyrolysis technology . Primary raw materials will be sawdust and forest residues. Pyrolysis oil will replace the use of heavy
fuel oil in heat-only boilers and power plants. The use of 200 GWh of pyrolysis oil instead of heavy fuel oil can reduce CO 2
emissions by about 60,000 tonnes. In 2012, Fortum submitted an environmental permit application for the use of pyrolysis oil at the
Vermo heat plant in Espoo.
In December 2012, Fortum made a decision to invest in a new biomass fuelled combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Värtan,
Stockholm. The production capacity of the CHP plant is about 280 megawatts (MW) heat and 130 MW electricity . The new plant will
use primarily forest biomass, but can use a full range of other types of biomass as well. The share of bioenergy in fuel use at the
Värtan plant will increase from today's 45% to as high as 70% upon completion of the plant in 2016. The use of fossil fuels will
decrease accordingly .
Construction of the Järvenpää and Jelgava CHP plants continued as planned, and they will be commissioned in 2013. The

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) will be an important abatement measure of CO 2emissions and will have a pivotal role in energy
system transformation in the future. In 2012, Fortum participated in CCS research programmes in Finland and the EU. Fortum was
the main financer of Cleen's CCS research and is represented in ZEP , the Zero Emission Platform. However , the feasibility of CCS
still faces major technical, economic, social and political challenges. The current cost level of CCS does not yet of fer solid business
cases for successful investments. Fortum is investing in so-called second-generation CCS concepts and technologies in its
research and considers them more promising than the technologies researched so far .
EN19 Emissions of ozone-depleting substances
Fortum has about 150 tonnes of R22 (HCFC-22 refrigerant) in the heat pump facilities at Värtan and Hammarby in Stockholm. In
2012, emissions of R22 into the atmosphere were 2.7 tonnes, which is about 370 kg as R1 1 equivalent. R22 is also a strong
greenhouse gas and the emission from these two plants is equivalent to 4,500 tons of CO2.
EN20 NO X, SO 2and other significant air emissions
In 2012, Fortum's thermal energy production emitted 29,400 tonnes (201 1: 36,000) of NO X,19,800 tonnes (201 1: 24,900) of
SO2and16,000 tonnes (201 1: 16,600) of particle emissions. SO 2, NO Xand particle emissions from Fortum's European production
plants have decreased significantly in recent decades as a result of advancements in flue-gas cleaning technology and combustion
process control.
About 72% of the flue-gas emissions (SO 2and NO X) and about 96% of the particle emissions originated from the Russian
operations. The most significant source of particle emissions (9,070 tonnes in 2012) is the Argayash plant in Russia.
The single most important emissions reduction measure in 2012 was the change of the coal used at Argayash CHP and
Chelyabinsk CHP-2. The use of the new coal was at the planned level. About 70% of the annual consumption of coal has been
switched to a higher quality coal with an ash content of 16–19%, compared to the previous coal with an ash content of 41–45%. The
sulphur content has also decreased from 0.9% to 0.6%. At these two plants, an overall reduction of 44% in particle emissions and
34% reduction in SO 2emissions per used tonne of coal was achieved compared with the year 2010, when the coal change project
was initiated.
However , due to the increased coal consumption, the total SO 2emissions in Russia increased in 2012. Particle emissions remained
at the same level in spite of higher coal consumption.
In 2012, the emissions of mercury into air were 130 kg.

Energy production impacts on water systems are mainly caused by the thermal load of cooling water discharges and the impurities
in waste water ef fluents. All waste water is conducted directly to municipal sewage treatment plants or cleaned on-site before being
discharged into water systems.
In 2012, Fortum used a total of 3,580 million m3(2011: 3,750) of cooling water that was mostly discharged to water systems. The
thermal load on the water systems was 17 TWh (201 1: 21). The biggest single water withdrawal in 2012 was at the Loviisa nuclear
power plant in Finland, where 1,327 million m3of cooling water was abstracted and discharged back to the sea. The thermal load
into the sea was 15 TWh. Measurements indicate that the cooling water has increased the temperature of surface water by 1–2 ºC
within a distance of 1–2 kilometres from the discharge point.
About 60 m3of oil and chemicals was relased into water along with waste waters and oil or chemical leaks. The majority of this (50
m3) was bio-oil that leaked into the sea in unloading a tanker in Stockholm.
In Russia, the wet method is used to pump ash from coal-fired power plants into ash basins. W astewaters from the basins are led
into water systems and the deposited ash remains in the basin. During 2012, the plants implemented improvement measures for
wastewater handling in order to decrease non-compliances regarding the exceedance of pollutant concentrations defined in the
permits. There were fewer non-compliances than in previous years: a total of 12 cases (201 1: 20) at five plants during the year .
Water flows from the coal-fired plants through ash basins were separated and reduced. The use of better quality coal also improved
the situation, because the amount of ash and consequently the volume of wastewater decreased.

Ash and by-products
About 720,000 tonnes of ash and 19,000 tonnes of gypsum were generated in 2012. About 40% of the ash was generated
atRussian plants, 26% in Sweden, 17% in Poland, 15% in Finland and the rest in the Baltic countries. In Europe, ash and by-
products of desulphurisation are utilised and recycled as ef ficiently as possible. In Russia, ash is stored in basins because it does
not have other usages, except for building embankments for ash basins, and the wet ash handling makes utilisation more dif ficult. In
2012, the ash recycling rate at Fortum was 51% and the gypsum recycling rate 42%.
Gypsum is utilised in the gypsum board industry . The gypsum volume was clearly lower than in the previous years because of the
assignment of Naantali power plant to T urun Seudun Maakaasu ja Energiantuotanto Oy and low production volumes of coal
condensing power . The utilisation of gypsum at the Meri-Pori power plant decreased from 201 1.
Fly ash was used in the construction material industry , in road construction, as made-up ground and in backfilling mines. New
product development for ash was carried out in 2012 in collaboration with dif ferent parties. In Sweden, a project to build a test road
with slag from municipal waste incineration at Högdalen, in Stockholm, continued.
Any remaining by-products that cannot be utilised are deposited in landfills or intermediate storage. In 2012, about 351,000 tonnes
of ash and 11,000 tonnes of gypsum were deposited on landfill sites. All desulphurisation product from the Suomenoja power plant
is deposited in a landfill, because the semi-dry desulphurisation method does not produce a by-product suitable for utilisation.
Nuclear waste
In 2012, Fortum used 21 tonnes of uranium fuel at the Loviisa nuclear power plant and produced a corresponding amount of high-
level radioactive nuclear waste. In addition, about 130 m3of low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste was produced. After
measuring the radioactivity , some of the low-level waste was reclassified as non-radioactive and was disposed of like other
conventional waste.
Low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste is disposed of in the underground repository at the power plant site in Loviisa. During
2012, 284 drums (200 litres each) of low-level maintenance waste were disposed of in the repository . In 2012, an extension of the
repository was taken into use, and at the end of the year , 41% of the current disposal capacity was in use.

In 2012, Fortum's operations generated a total of 41,200 tonnes (201 1: 30,500) of waste (excluding gypsum and ash deposited in
landfills), 10,400 tonnes (201 1: 12,800) of which was hazardous. In addition, 3,100 tonnes (201 1: 1,300) of contaminated soil was
removed in site remediation projects.

spills of more than 100 litres (201 1: 28) into the environment, most of them were oil. The total volume of the spills was about 58 m3.
The single biggest spill was of 50 m3of bio-oil into the sea when unloading a tanker in Stockholm.
None of the spills caused major environmental damage. The most extensive clean-up actions involved the replacement of the soil
around the transformers and the recovery of oil discharged in water systems.

Products and services
EN26 Mitigating environmental impacts of products and services
Fortum is building a low-carbon society by of fering products and services that can help mitigate climate change also in other sectors
of society .
In 2012, all electricity sold to private customers in Finland was CO 2-free and produced by hydropower and wind power . The origin of
the hydropower and wind power was guaranteed with European Guarantees of Origin or with the EKOenergy label of the Finnish
Association for Nature Conservation.
In 2012, all electricity in Sweden was sold with an environmental value. Customers can actively choose between a mix of wind and
hydro, which is also labelled with Good Environmental Choice, or they can choose to have their energy entirely from either wind or
hydropower . The Good Environmental Choice eco-label was founded and is overseen by the Swedish Society for Nature
Conservation. The electricity sold as entirely wind or hydropower is based on European guarantees of origin. Customers not making
an active choice receive nuclear power , which is CO 2-free in the production phase. Assigned deliveries (Fortum Enkel) have Good
Environmental Choice eco-labelled wind and hydro power in their delivery .
In Finland and Sweden, Fortum's carbon-neutral heating product of fers customers the opportunity to influence their CO 2emissions.
Companies are able to of fset their CO 2emissions resulting from their use of heat by purchasing international carbon of fsets.
The extent of impact mitigation can be assessed by assuming that all electricity sold by Fortum (13 TWh in 2012) would have had
the specific CO 2emission of the Nordic electricity mix. The consequent CO 2emissions would have been about 1.4 million tonnes.
Fortum's sales of CO 2-free electricity resulted in no greenhouse gas emissions.

regulations
In Fortum's European operations, no significant environmental non-compliances or permit violations occurred in 2012 (201 1: 0). In
Russia, the total number of non-compliances (12) related to wastewater emissions decreased from the previous year (20).
The amount of fines paid for wastewater permit violations in Russia decreased and totalled EUR 1,000 (201 1: 2,000). In 2012,
reporting was made more specific with the detailed environmental dashboard developed in 201 1. The dashboard contains data on
emissions and waste, environmental aspects and environmental fees. The water treatment systems at the Chelyabinsk CHP1,
CHP2 and CHP3 plants were improved by developing chemical treatment, closed loop water systems and by reducing and
separating water flows from coal ash handling.

EN29 Environmental impacts of transportation
Fortum reports the greenhouse gas emissions of its company car fleet and the company benefit cars operated by its employees. In
2012, the CO 2emissions from Fortum's cars were 2,300 tonnes. Fortum also reports the CO 2emissions from the flights of its
employees and of fsets for the emissions annually . In 2012, the CO 2emission from Fortum's air travel was 4,700 tonnes. T ogether ,
Fortum's cars and air travel accounted for 0.03% of the total greenhouse gas emissions .
The indirect emissions from the shipping of coal, oil and wood fuels have been roughly estimated. The CO 2emission was of the
order 125,000 tonnes in 2012, contributing to 0.5% of Fortum's total greenhouse gas emissions.
Transporting fuels and materials by road and rail results in emissions of SO 2, NO xand particles. Fortum has no relevant information
on the transport equipment of the fuel suppliers and therefore these emissions cannot be calculated.
In February 2012, coal dust was detected on the buildings on the islands close to the Meri-Pori coal-fired plant. Its origin could not
be identified. Fortum and Pohjolan V oima Oy , which owns the adjacent T ahkoluoto power plant, took responsibility for clean-up of
the area. The companies worked together with authorities on plans to develop operating ways and to prevent similar environmental
impacts.

EN30 T otal environmental protection expenditures and investments
EHS expenditures
Fortum's Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) expenditures (EHS investments and operating costs) are costs resulting from
measures that primarily aim to manage and reduce the environmental impacts of Fortum's operations or to improve operational
safety .
Costs are defined as EHS costs regardless of whether the measures are mandatory on the basis of legislation or permit conditions
or whether they are voluntary . Costs related to environmentally benign products and services are also included.
In 2012, Fortum's investments in environment and safety were a total of EUR 63 million (201 1: 82). The investments were mainly
related to health and safety , air pollution prevention and dam safety . Operating costs related to the environment, health and safety
were EUR 62 million (201 1: 89). The costs include, e.g., use and maintenance of environmental protection equipment and systems,
emissions and environmental monitoring, decontamination of polluted soil, maintaining and developing biodiversity , development of
EHS management systems, research and development work related to improving the management of environmental impacts, and
the necessary environmental impact assessment reports and permit applications.
The figures are illustrative, because the calculation principles for EHS expenses and investments are not yet completely uniform
throughout Fortum. In 201 1, guidelines for the accounting and reporting of EHS costs were developed in order to clarify the EHS
cost categories, the evaluation of EHS investments and the estimation of costs of own work.

Labour/management relations
Collaboration between employees and Fortum management is based on local legislation and the Code of Conduct . In Finland,
Fortum's employee representation system is site- and company-specific, and representatives are selected by personnel groups.
Group collaboration meetings in Finland are held at least twice a year in conjunction with the Group's financial statements and
interim reports.
In Sweden, the system is fundamentally identical. Collaboration between personnel representatives and Fortum management in
Sweden takes place in the Council (Sverigerådet) that convenes twice a year . The collaboration forms are based on the agreement
made between the company and personnel representatives.
In Estonia, the W orking Council convened three times during 2012. In other countries of operation, collaboration is being
implemented in councils between personnel representatives and employer representatives. Councils meet either regularly or on an
as-needed basis.
In Poland, some 30 meetings were arranged with the local labour union. The meetings focused on salary- and benefits-related
issues, occupational safety , improving collaboration, and harmonisation of employment contracts in Bytom and Zabrze. In 2012,
there were no disputes related to employment terms.
As a rule, the Fortum European Council (FEC) convenes once a year . In 2012, the meeting was held in May and personnel
representatives from Finland, Sweden, Poland and Estonia participated. Issues on the Council's agenda included the CEO's current
review and themed workshops where the company's strategy , well-being, occupational health and safety , and Leading Performance
and Growth initiative were addressed through group discussions and presentations.
Negotiations were held with personnel representatives regarding the adoption of the Raise a concern reporting channel as part of
the Fortum Code of Conduct in Finland, Sweden and Norway and in line with each country's legislation and respective agreements.
The negotiations addressed the channel's operating principles and particularly issues related to the collection and processing of
information.
LA4 Coverage of collective bargaining agreements
Fortum respects its employees' freedom of association and collective bargaining, but does not monitor the degree of unionisation of
its employees. Fortum applies local collective bargaining agreements in all countries where it operates, in compliance with the
scope of each respective agreement.
LA5 Minimum notice period regarding operational changes
In situations of organisational restructuring, Fortum negotiates with personnel representatives in compliance with each country's
local legislation and contractual procedures. The minimum notice period is based on local legislation, collective agreements or
employment contracts, which are in harmony with local legislation and agreements. In situations involving personnel reductions,
Fortum aims primarily to support the re-employment of its personnel.

Fortum's all-time best. Fortum's target is to avoid fatalities and accidents with serious injuries. In 2012, there was one fatal accident
for our contractor at the Nyagan power plant construction site in Russia. The total number of serious accidents to Fortum personnel
and contractors was ten, i.e. a slight decrease (201 1: 11). There were three serious accidents to own personnel.
Other occupational safety performance indicators regarding our own personnel improved or remained at the 201 1 level. There were
29 work injuries resulting in an absence in 2012 (201 1: 29). Four of the injuries happened to females, the rest to males. The
decrease in serious injuries resulted in fewer personnel absences resulting from work injuries: 560 days (201 1: 1,134). Fortum
personnel's total recordable injury frequency (TRIF), which includes also minor injuries that do not lead to an absence, improved
slightly and was 3.4 (201 1: 3.5).
Safety management at Fortum equally encompasses contractors working at Fortum sites. The L WIF for contractors weakened
somewhat from 3.2 to 3.8. One fatality and six serious injuries occurred with contractor employees. Contractor safety is a big
challenge and will remain a focus area also in 2013. Several development projects have been launched to improve the situation,
and contractor safety is more clearly included in the incentive systems.
In 2012, the proactive indicator targets (safety reports and initiatives, completion of the agreed actions and safety observation tours)
were achieved in all areas, except safety reports, at the Group level. In 2013, the emphasis will remain on the importance of
proactive reporting to improve safety in those organisations where the reporting level has not been achieved.
A good performance was achieved also in most of the process safety indicators. The number of fires clearly decreased, from 16 to
9, and there were zero non-compliances related to dam safety . However , there were three INES 1 incidents at the Loviisa nuclear
power plant (201 1: 0); these incidents did not harm people, the environment or the plant.
Fortum strives to ensure safe and healthy work conditions for personnel and supports the maintenance and development of working
capacity . The monitoring of sickness-related absences is defined at the Group level, and the rate of absence due to sickness was
3.1% in 2012; the rate of absence due to sickness was 3.1% for males and 3.0% for females.
In 2012, there were three (201 1: 8) cases of suspected occupational diseases in Finland. The suspected occupational diseases are
related to noise and occurred with males. Additionally , one male was diagnosed with an occupational disease related to exposure to
asbestos.

EU18 Percentage of contractor and subcontractor employees that have undergone
relevant health and safety training
The safety of subcontractor and contractor employees is as important as the safety of Fortum's own employees. Contractor safety
targets are set based on a continuous improvement principle, safety incidents and accidents are reported, accidents are
investigated, and safety performance indicators are monitored on a monthly basis. Fortum is committed to contractor safety in all
aspects of contractor management – from contractor selection and job performance to the post-performance contractor evaluation.
Requirements are set forth in the corporate-level safety instructions and the purchasing organisation's instructions. The instructions
were further specified in 2012, and the new requirements will take ef fect in 2013.
One of the key elements in the instructions is the requirement to provide proper induction training and on-site orientation to all
workers, including contractors, before starting the work. Ef ficient induction training ensures a good understanding of site-specific
risks, procedures and safety requirements. Induction training is valid for a limited period, typically , not more than three years.
Induction training includes at least site-specific safety requirements, rules, instructions, work permit procedures, the main risks of
the site and how to prepare for them, required personnel protective equipment, near-miss and incident reporting, emergency
response, inspections, housekeeping, fire protection, first-aid systems, evacuation plans, and the individuals responsible for these
tasks. V erification that the safety procedures and requirements given in the induction training are understood is ensured by using
interpreters, when needed, and by testing. All of these requirements cover all types of contractors and subcontractors.
Implementation of the training is the responsibility of the local organisations.
In 2012, investments in contractor safety training continued. The ESD Division and the Heat Division's Finnish functions
implemented the online training programmes developed in 201 1. In Finland, for example, more than 1,000 contractor employees
completed the training. Additionally , Fortum's "Stop and Think" safety training was organised for contractors in the ESD Division and
the Power Division.

LA12 Employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews by
gender
Fortum's permanent employees in all operating countries are within the scope of the performance and development discussion
processes, which are implemented on a personal and/or team level. The annual performance and development reviews support the
employee/supervisor dialogue about goals, achievements and opportunities for professional development. The discussions aim to
commit and motivate employees, engage them in the implementation of the strategy , business goals and operating plans, and
improve operational planning, the workplace atmosphere and the flow of information, as well as promote performance and growth at
the individual and corporate level.
Personal and/or team-specific targets aligned with Fortum's strategy are set at the beginning of the year . At the same time, the
needed competence is verified and last year's performance is assessed. The achievement of targets forms the basis for incentives
to be paid. Permanent employees, excluding employees of recently acquired companies, are within the sphere of Fortum's incentive
plan. The aim is to gradually implement a Fortum-wide performance and development model also at new Fortum sites.
The performance and development process applies to all permanent employees, however , the electronic tool used in the process in
2012 covered about 64% of the personnel, and it was not in use with certain personnel groups in Poland and Russia. Of the
personnel covered by the electronic tool, the performance and development process was conducted for 96%. Completion rate
among female employees was 95.8% and among male employees 96.3%. Thus performance and development process was
equally completed among female and male employees. The company-wide completion rate cannot yet be provided.

updated Fortum Code of Conduct. Based on the model, line management regularly reports on compliance activities and the
detected deviations to the Group management.
The Fortum Code of Conduct and compliance topics and instructions are communicated through internal and external
communication channels. The communication highlights the commitment of top management, and it follows the principles of
transparency in sustainability reporting.
However , if incidents of corruption occur , Fortum has internal procedures for dealing with the incident professionally , in accordance
with applicable laws and with respect to the rights and personal integrity of the persons and parties involved. Each incident will be
first properly investigated, including a hearing of the relevant persons and parties, and then the appropriate sanctions and corrective
actions, if deemed necessary , will be considered.
Furthermore, after each incident an assessment is made regarding the need to raise awareness of the Fortum Code of Conduct.
This can be done through e.g. e-learning or face-to-face training, in the relevant business organisation to ensure that employees are
fully aware of what is considered appropriate conduct at Fortum and what their responsibility is in case of non-compliance.

Fortum annually measures customer satisfaction and the company's reputation and factors af fecting it also with the extensive One
Fortum survey targeting dif ferent stakeholder groups: customers, the general public, governmental bodies, capital markets, non-
governmental organisations and Fortum's personnel. In 2012, the survey was conducted in Finland, Sweden, Norway , Poland, the
Baltic countries and Russia.
According to the survey , Fortum's reputation is still the strongest within the capital markets and weakest amongst the general public.
Compared to the 201 1 results, Fortum's reputation has developed favourably amongst all stakeholder groups, except customers.
The development has been most favourable amongst non-governmental organisations and opinion leaders.
The survey indicates that customer satisfaction has improved significantly amongst the ESD Division's business customers. For
other customers, satisfaction has remained at the previous year's level. Fortum's reputation amongst customers in Finland is slightly
weaker than before, which also has an impact on the overall rating received from the customer target group.
Marketing communications

Fortum Markets AB in Sweden received five decisions from the direct marketing committee, DM-nämnden, related to a breach of
good marketing practices. DM-nämnden is not an authority , but the direct marketing industry's own self-regulating committee. The
decisions received were due to errors made when collecting the contact information of potential customers. In these cases Fortum
was not able to show that it had received permission to contact the potential customer or that the potential customer had not been
contacted. The breaches did not result in any fines.

Independent assurance report on Fortum's Corporate Sustainability report
To the Management of Fortum Corporation
We have performed an assurance engagement on the Fortum Corporate Sustainability report for the reporting period of January 1,
2012 to December 31, 2012. The information subject to the assurance engagement is the Finnish version of the report published in
the website http://annualreporting2012.fortum.com/ .
Management's responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation of the Corporate Sustainability report in conformity with the Sustainability Reporting
Guidelines (G3.1) of the Global Reporting Initiative and principles of inclusivity , materiality and responsiveness as set out in the
AA1000 AccountAbility Principles (2008) (AA1000APS). This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the Corporate sustainability report that are free from material
misstatement, selecting and applying appropriate criteria and making estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. The
scope of the 2012 Fortum Corporate Sustainability report and the information included therein depends on the Fortum's Corporate
Sustainability priority areas as well as the reporting principles .
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to draw an assurance conclusion on the Fortum Corporate Sustainability report based on our work performed.
We have conducted the assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)
3000 to provide public limited assurance on non-financial performance data within the Fortum´s Sustainability Report. In addition,
we have used the criteria in AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008) to evaluate the adherence of AA1000APS (2008) principles to
provide public T ype 1 moderate level assurance. This requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain required level of
assurance about whether the Fortum's Corporate Sustainability report is free of material misstatement.
We did not perform any assurance procedures on the prospective information, such as targets, expectations and ambitions,
disclosed in the Corporate Sustainability report. Consequently , we draw no conclusion on the prospective information.
A limited (moderate) assurance engagement with respect to a Corporate Sustainability report involves performing procedures to
obtain evidence about the information disclosed in the Corporate Sustainability report. The procedures performed depend on the
practitioner's judgment, but their nature is dif ferent from, and their extent is less than, a reasonable assurance engagement. It does
not include detailed testing of source data or the operating ef fectiveness of processes and internal controls and consequently they
do not enable us to obtain the assurance necessary to become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a
reasonable assurance engagement.
Our procedures on this engagement included:
•Assessing the suitability of the reporting policies and criteria used by management and the consistent application of such
policies, the inclusiveness of the stakeholders as well as the responses on the stakeholder dialogue and the overall
presentation of these in the Corporate Sustainability report;
•Conducting interviews with senior management responsible for Corporate Sustainability at Fortum to gain an
understanding of Fortum's targets for sustainability as part of the business strategy and operations;

included in the Corporate Sustainability report and evaluating whether the information presented in the Corporate
Sustainability report is in line with our overall knowledge of Corporate Sustainability at Fortum;
•Conducting interviews with employees responsible for the collection and reporting of sustainability information and
reviewing of the processes and systems for data gathering, including the aggregation of the data for the Corporate
Sustainability report;
•Performing analytical review procedures and testing data on a sample basis to assess the reasonability of the presented
sustainability information;
•Performing site visits to selected sites to review compliance to reporting policies, to assess the reliability of the
sustainability data reporting process as well as to test the data collected for sustainability reporting purposes on a sample
basis;
•Evaluating the application of the AA1000APS (2008) principles;
•Assessing the Company's stated application level according to GRI's guidelines.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is suf ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Observations & Recommendations
Based on our limited (moderate) assurance engagement, we provide the following recommendations in relation to the AA1000APS
(2008) and GRI G3.1 principles. The recommendations are to improve Fortum´s management and reporting of sustainability in the
future and they do not af fect to our conclusion:
•Inclusivity – Fortum has a comprehensive stakeholder inclusiveness process in place and throughout this process Fortum
has identified the relevant key stakeholder groups for its operations. In 2012, Fortum has improved the presentation of the
stakeholder inclusiveness and co-operation. W e encourage Fortum to further develop ways for stakeholders to be
involved in decisions that will improve sustainability performance and to continue the active dialogue with the key
stakeholders.
•Materiality – Fortum has developed a system to determine important and material issues for Fortum´s stakeholders. W e
recommend that Fortum further develops the process of prioritizing and selecting the content of the report in relation to
materiality .
•Responsiveness – The report includes a significant amount of information how Fortum has responded to stakeholder
expectations. W e recommend Fortum to enhance the presentation and the structure of the report to systematically
communicate the responses to all material issues.
•Other recommendations – During 2012 Fortum has further developed the central coordination process and related
internal controls for the Sustainability reporting process. However , the control activities implemented dif fer on a site level.
We encourage Fortum to continue the development of harmonized control activities relating to the source data collection
for the Sustainability Report.
Our independence and competences in providing assurance to Fortum
We complied with Deloitte's independence policies which preclude us from taking financial, commercial, governance and ownership
positions which might af fect, or be perceived to af fect, our independence and impartiality and from any involvement in the
preparation of the report. W e have confirmed to Fortum that we have maintained our independence and objectivity throughout the
year and in particular that there were no events or prohibited services provided which could impair our independence and
objectivity .
This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance and sustainability expertise with professional
qualifications. Our team is experienced in providing sustainability reporting assurance.

quickly
In Fortum's view , solar energy is one of the most important energy
production forms in the future solar economy .
Solar energy has a lot of potential – the earth receives about 800 million terawatt-
hours of solar energy annually , over 5,000 times more than the global primary
energy consumption.
Solar energy technology , particularly photovoltaic technology (PV), has advanced
quickly in recent years. The cost of solar PV modules has dropped significantly ,
and it is estimated that also non-subsidised solar energy will become competitive
with other energy sources already during this decade. Solar energy production
capacity has also increased quickly – in 2012 about 30 gigawatts of solar
electricity was installed in the world, and at the end of the year the total capacity
was about 100 gigawatts.
A solar business development team established its operations at Fortum at the
beginning of 2012. During the year , the team analysed the development
prospects for solar energy markets and technologies, and assessed potential
business models. Large-scale solar electricity production in locations with plenty
of sunshine is the best match with Fortum's strengths. In 2012, Fortum also
commercially launched a solar kit containing a solar PV system that connects to
the grid.
In 2012 Fortum

Fortum's goal is to increase the use of biofuels in its combined heat
and power (CHP) production.
The company's expertise makes it possible to use a diverse selection of fuels,
and bio-based, local fuels are becoming increasingly important. The new
pyrolysis plant to be built in connection with the Joensuu CHP plant in Finland will
showcase the use of biofuels. In addition to electricity and heat, the plant will also
produce bio-oil. Based on fast pyrolysis technology , the CHP plant is the first of its
kind in the world on an industrial scale. Upon completion, the Joensuu plant will
produce 50,000 tons of bio-oil annually , enough to meet the heating needs of
more than 10,000 single-family homes.
Energy produced with bio-oil reduces carbon dioxide emissions by over 70%
compared to fossil fuels. The initial intention is to replace the fuel oil used at
Fortum's own heat plants with the bio-oil made from forest residues and other
wood-based biomass. In the future, bio-oil could also be used as traf fic fuel or as
raw material for various biochemicals.
Upon completion, the
Joensuu plant will
produce 50,000 tons

familiar to all employees
Fortum's Code of Conduct defines the general principles of how we
treat others, how we engage in business and how we safeguard our
corporate assets.
The Code of Conduct is based on Fortum's shared values – accountability ,
creativity , respect and honesty . The first version of the Code of Conduct was
published in 2007, and it was revised in the spring of 2012 due to changes in the
operating environment and legislation, among other things.
The communications and training related to the revision were rolled out in all
countries of operation in the same manner: the majority of Fortum employees
took part in an online course and team discussions about ethical ways of
operating. T eam training was also held in Russia and Poland for employees who
do not use a computer . By the end of February 2013, 99% of the personnel had
completed the training related to the Code of Conduct. The training will continue
in 2013.
In Russia, implementation of the Code of Conduct and getting employees familiar
with it is the responsibility of the Compliance organisation, which was established
in 2010 to strengthen the culture of ethical practices. The Compliance
organisation has adopted the best practices of international companies in matters
related to, e.g., the protection of assets and combating inappropriate payments.
The organisation's work is particularly important because Russia ranked 143 in
the global corruption index, whereas Finland ranked 2.

In 2012, Fortum improved the safety of the plants it had acquired in
2011 in Poland.
As a result of several concrete changes implemented at the Zabrze and Bytom
CHP plants, the plants quickly met Fortum's safety requirements. Personnel
safety training continued at the plants, and work safety was enhanced by
renewing the employees' protective equipment and by improving and cleaning the
work environment. Investments in plant safety , in turn, improved the safety of coal
handling and plant start-ups. Additionally , the reporting and the investigation of
incidents was improved.
The work has significantly improved the safety at the plants. There were no fires
or leaks at the plants in 2012. In 2012, as in 201 1,there was one lost workday
accident. The number of lost workday accidents in 2009 and 2010 was 4 and 5,
respectively .The ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification of the plants has
also advanced as planned, and certification audits will be conducted during the

in Finland
Exceptionally widespread flooding of the Oulujoki water system took
place in summer 2012 in Finland.
The amount of rainfall in the first ten days of August was almost 50% more than
what is normal for the entire month. This much precipitation occurs less frequently
than once every 250 years. Fortum was able to mitigate the situation somewhat
by regulating the waters in the system, but the level of Oulujärvi lake still rose by
more than 10 cm over the top limit of regulation. The high water level caused
flood damage to residential properties along the shoreline. Most of the damage
was to various shoreline structures. Authorities noted that the water-level
regulation was in line with the permit in the flood situation, and regulating the
water couldn't have prevented the flooding.
Even though Fortum wasn't obligated to compensate for damages caused by the
flooding, the company's experts inspected all of the 300+ damage sites reported
by the residents. At some sites, Fortum made agreements with the residents on
joint projects to repair the shoreline flood damages. The company also sent a
personal letter to everyone who had reported damage; the letter provided
background information about the flooding situation and about the possibility to
apply for compensation from the State.
Fortum and the authorities are working together to determine how the regulating
practices and permits for the water system's regulated lakes could be changed to
minimise any damages from similar flooding in the future. Fortum has already
taken the initiative to make changes to the planning of runs and is striving to
improve flood control in all possible ways.

Cleaning the Fukushima waters is, in fact, the world's largest decontamination
operation of radioactive liquids. The Fortum-developed and -registered NURES®
products, CsT reat® and SrT reat®, performed very well in the decontamination
tests conducted in Fukushima, and they were chosen at the beginning of 2012 as
the key technologies to treat the contaminated waters. The aim is to
decontaminate 500 cubic meters of water every 24 hours in the upcoming years
to bring the radioactive concentrations below the set limits. Deliveries of the
materials started in July . It is the all-time biggest delivery of NURES® products.

France is home to Europe's second largest hydropower capacity , about one fifth
of which is planned to be opened up to competition in the upcoming years.
Fortum's ambition in France is to contribute to building a low-carbon society by
utilising its expertise in ef ficient and environmentally benign hydropower
production. During the past two years, under the leadership of Philippe Stohr ,
Country Manager for Fortum France SNC, Fortum has engaged in an active
dialogue with local authorities, politicians and organisations about hydropower
development. The goal of the discussions is to co-create new ideas for
sustainable hydropower production while leveraging Fortum's expertise and
taking into consideration the needs of stakeholders.
As an outcome of the discussions held, Fortum compiled a comprehensive report
summarising the observations made in the 1 10 interviews. Fortum was also
invited to the French National Assembly to share its views on hydropower and the
tendering process.

Habitare fair in Helsinki. The stand welcomed thousands of visitors who checked
out the energy solutions for the home of the future.
The design year also resulted in the launch of a rapid charging station for electric
vehicles in Espoo in collaboration with HOK-Elanto. Additionally , Espoo residents
had an opportunity to design new looks for electric cabinets. Fortum's head of fice
in Keilaniemi, Espoo, was open to the public twice during the design year: in
February , Espoo residents had a rare opportunity to check out masterpieces in
Fortum Art Foundation's art collection; in August, the public admired the Espoo
seascape from the rooftop terrace of the head of fice. Art owned by Fortum Art
Foundation was also on display during the year at the Amos Anderson Art
Museum. An urban garden and bee farm were established at the head of fice
courtyard for the summer season. The harvest was enjoyed by Fortum's business
visitors.
Suvanto lounges for
work and relaxation
were created at the
Helsinki-V antaa
airport.

consumption
Real-time measuring of electricity consumption was adopted in
Sweden in 2009. The same obligation will take ef fect in Finland by
the beginning of 2014.
Among other things, smart meters enable the development of new kinds of smart
services that facilitate everyday life for consumers. These kinds of products
include Fortum Fiksu, sold in Finland, and Fortum Energy Display , offered in
Finland, Sweden and Norway , and Fortum Hemkontroll, of fered in Sweden.
Fortum Energy Display is an in-home display terminal for real-time monitoring
ofthe home's total consumption of electricity . Increased awareness of household
electricity consumption enables consumers to use their electric devices more
efficiently and that results in lower electricity bills. The device can also be
programmed with daily consumption targets and limits. Fortum Hemkontroll was
introduced in Sweden at the beginning of 2013. Like the Energy Display , it can be
used to monitor household electricity consumption – but it can also be used to
control electric devices and heating at home with a computer or smart phone.
In 2012, Fortum commercially launched Fortum Fiksu, a product that
automatically controls electrically heated water boilers. The product might also be
called new-era night-time electricity . This device makes it possible to lower home
heating costs because the control system retrieves a weather forecast from the
Internet and an electricity price from the electricity exchange for each hour of the
day and night. With the information, the most economical hours of the day/night
are automatically selected to heat the water in the boiler . Once the equipment is
installed, electricity consumption can be monitored with a computer or smart
phone.
Remote reading helps
everyday life for
consumers.

heating network
District heating's share of the heating markets in Russia is over
50%.
The heating season in Russia starts when the average outdoor temperature
remains below +8 degrees for five days. The local authority makes the actual
decision on the start of the heating season. In Fortum's operating area, the
heating season lasts about 8.5 months – typically starting in late September or
early October and ending in the middle of May .
Fortum and its subsidiary Urals Heat Network are refurbishing trunk networks
annually . Over the past three years, the old insulation was replaced with
polyurethane, which has increased the service life of the pipes and decreased
heat loss. Additionally , moisture meters have been installed in the heating
network in order to locate possible damages in the network. This way , repairs can
be made promptly and disruptions in heat delivery can be kept as short as
possible.
The life of the pipes
has increased and
heat loss decreased.

programme started at Fortum in 2012, and the solar economy . Additionally , in a
separate contest, the unit with the most improved initiative process was awarded.
The Fortum Management T eam chose the winners, and the awards were given at
Summit 2013, the annual strategy meeting for Fortum's top management. The
grand prize for 2012 went to Esko T usa, the developer of the NURES products for
decontaminating radioactive liquids. The Suomenoja plant and its personnel in

The dialogue about the future of the EU energy markets, and
particularly the electricity market model, escalated in 2012.
Fortum is concerned that the competitiveness of market-based production will be
undermined by subsidy-based energy production gaining ground. Fortum's goal is
for a market-driven transition to carbon dioxide-free energy production, which
would be best encouraged by ef ficiently functioning emissions trading. As a result
of the weak economic situation and the overlapping steering mechanisms
watering down each other , the EU's emissions trading has not been able to steer
production and investments along the intended low-carbon course.
Fortum has actively participated in the European dialogue about the necessity for
well-functioning electricity markets and has done its own investigative studies and
modelling on the functioning of the markets; the results have been distributed also
to external stakeholder groups. Fortum has engaged in close collaboration with
the European Commission in particular . Fortum has also been active in the Union
of the Electricity Industry – Eurelectric, which represents the common interests of
the whole European electricity industry , and has participated in discussions with
national authorities and other stakeholders.

and the environment
Fortum has two educational projects in Poland to teach local school
kidsabout energy and to encourage them to take responsibility for
the world around them.
In Wrocław , 120 children participated in the Pro-environmental Creative
Competition that Fortum and the W rocław T eacher T raining Centre organised for
the sixth time. The main purpose of the competition was to educate children
about energy and the environment. The slogan of the competition -- "What is
energy to you?" -- provided a platform for children's artwork, comic strips and
multimedia presentations.
In Czestochowa, teachers were trained to use the Energy Game, developed by
Fortum, as an alternative learning method. As a result, students of 50 secondary
and high schools solved problems related to issues like energy conservation and
energy generation.
Both projects are continuing in 2013.
 Secondary and high-
school students solved
problems related to
energy conservation
and energy
generation.
