Preface 2014–2015 Sustainability Report
A Message from Our CEO 
Thank you for your interest in Analog Devices’ 
(ADI) Sustainability Report for 2014–2015.
In 2015, ADI celebrated its 50th anniversary— 
fifty years of delivering innovations and 
technologies that have changed the world by facilitating dramatic advances in communications, healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, and scientific inquiry. We achieved this milestone through an 
unwavering commitment to engineering excellence, tight alignment to market dynamics, and focus on our larger stakeholder ecosystem including our employees, customers, partners, communities, and investors. These same principles guide our actions today and ensure that ADI will remain a vibrant business for the next 50 years and beyond.
ADI’s tagline, “Ahead of What’s Possible,” reflects our focus on the future. 
Many of the innovations the world will marvel at tomorrow are being developed at ADI today. Sometimes, those innovations take years or even decades to achieve their full potential. The toughest technological challenges—the ones that most excite and inspire us—defy easy or short-term solutions and by necessity require a longer-term perspective.
That long-term perspective requires ADI to take a broader, more comprehensive 
view of our web of interconnections here and now. It requires thinking through actions and reactions and causes and consequences in everything we do. From our facilities, to our assets, to our materials, to our operations, sustainability isn’t just a corporate social responsibility initiative; it’s a business imperative.
At ADI, we pursue sustainability along four axes—economic, environmental, 
social, and governance and ethics.
Economic sustainability—While ADI is in business to make a profit, we are 
focused not just on the next quarter but on ensuring that our technological innovations continue to have impact and our employees and investors continue to share in the success of ADI for years to come. Our best-in-class financial model, global operations, and smart supply chain management are just a few of the ways we are able to successfully serve our stakeholders while maximizing our ability to pursue the business practices and innovations that support our longer-term success.
Environmental sustainability—To update the famous saying, any intel-
ligent fool can make things more wasteful and harmful. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction. ADI approaches the environmental impact of its operations, including the manufacturing and distribution of its products, with the same focus on innovation as it does the design of those products. We are committed to conserving resources, minimizing the environmental impacts of our opera-tions, and providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees and the communities in which we operate. We view this as an economic imperative as much as an environmental one.
Social sustainability—ADI’s stakeholder ecosystem extends beyond the 
typical focus on employees, customers, and investors to the communities and world in which we operate. We strive to be a positive influence in our communities by living up to the highest ethical standards, pursuing socially minded business practices, providing rewarding career and employment opportunities, and giving back to our communities in concert with our employees’ individual efforts.
Governance and ethical sustainability—Ethical behavior has been a core 
tenet of our company’s values since our earliest days. Our employees, across all locations and job functions, have internalized the value of ethical behavior, routinely going beyond mere compliance with applicable laws and regula-tions. Our long history of leadership in the area of governance and ethics has resulted in a trusted reputation among our customers, investors, and employees, as well as the communities where we operate. That is a trust that we have worked hard to earn and one we don’t take lightly.
This focus on the long-term and growing a sustainable business has given 
ADI the ability to deliver life-changing innovations for 50 years. 
We are in technologies that even a decade ago were still science fiction 
but today we take for granted. We are in cell phones that put the world’s information at the world’s finger tips. We are enabling the emergence of remote personalized healthcare management and treatment systems. We are in devices that are verifying the quality of our food and medicines. We are enabling more sustainable agricultural processes that are increasing both crop yields and nutrition. We are in applications that are used to monitor and reduce air and water pollution. We are improving fuel efficiency in cars and trucks, enabling drivers to operate their vehicles more safely, and saving lives daily through more effective, safer airbag deployments.
We are pleased to share this report, which catalogs the ways in which we have 
built a sustainable business that 50 years after its founding continues to bring incredible innovations to life. We pledge ourselves individually and as a company to remain focused on the future and staying Ahead of What’s Possible.
™
Sincerely,
v 
Vincent T. Roche President and Chief Executive Officer 3

Our Sustainability Priorities  u Environment 201 4–2015 Sustainability Report
Introduction
We are committed to protecting our employees’ health and safety in 
our facilities. Having a safe and healthy work environment is a major component of our sustainability program. Our program is designed to promote worksite health and employee well-being, as well as to reduce the number of injuries, lost work days, and absenteeism. 
We are also committed to operating in a way that minimizes impacts 
to the environment and conserves resources used in our operations. We monitor the use of resources (energy, water, and materials ) in our 
production operations and work to reduce the loss of these resources via discharges and emissions. Maintaining a preventive approach to resource utilization is a key element of our program. For example, one of our objectives is to minimize waste; in the event that waste is unavoidable in certain contexts, we seek out reduction and recy-cling options. We also seek to identify processes that require fewer resources and will generate less emissions or waste.
We establish environmental performance objectives using a five-year 
planning horizon, and make annual updates to our objectives, targets, and programs. Progress is reviewed quarterly at the corporate level and monthly at the site level, and senior management allocates resources appropriately to help keep programs on plan.Management Systems at ADI
ADI’s EH&S management systems are certified to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001, which are internationally recognized standards for Environmental and for Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S ) systems. Those standards 
enable organizations to develop and implement policies and objectives that take into account legal and other requirements, risks, and environmental considerations. 
External auditors conduct annual surveillance audits and triennial recertifica-
tion audits of ADI EH&S management systems. ADI maintains its external registrations to the current versions of the aforementioned standards, and plans to upgrade to the recently released ISO 14001:2015, and to ISO 45001 when that standard is finalized.
Organizational Structure
The Environmental, Health, and Safety (EH&S ) Director, who oversees the global 
EH&S organization and reports to the Senior Vice President (VP) of Global 
Operations and Technology, has overall responsibility for ADI’s compliance with applicable environmental standards and regulatory requirements. The Senior VP of Global Operations and Technology is a member of the CEO’s Staff, which is comprised of our most senior executives. Environmental issues, such as greenhouse gas emissions reduction, energy efficiency, water consumption, and other related matters are monitored through our EH&S system. Information about the relevant EH&S programs is reported to the Board of Directors. 
EHS Management meets regularly with the Company’s in-house counsel 
and as needed with external counsel, legal advisors, and financial personnel to discuss potential environmental risks (including those related to climate 
change ) and possible impact to the Company. Environment11
Environment  u Environment analog.com/sustainability
Our Compliance Review Board (CRB), which meets at least quarterly, consists 
of global membership from various departments including EH&S, manu-
facturing, engineering, quality, sales, and legal. The CRB routinely reviews regulations and industry standards and drives actions to address potential impacts. We regularly perform environmental management systems certifi-cations and track and review our EHS performance against goals. 
Review Process
We regularly review the aspects and impacts of our operations as part of our environmental management systems certification. This review is in the form of quarterly internal assessments and surveillance and recertification audits. Our management systems are certified to ISO 14001 and in process of upgrading to the recently released ISO 14001:2015, in addition to OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001, and TS 16949. We are proactively planning to upgrade OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001 when that standard is finalized. Where opportunities for continual improvement exist, they are evaluated and considered for implementation.
We track and review our EH&S performance against goals on a regular basis. 
Results of our review are reported to management on a quarterly basis, and responsive actions are implemented where appropriate. 
We have also engaged a third-party auditor to conduct compliance audits of 
our facilities once every three years. The most recent corporate EH&S audit was conducted in 2015 for all manufacturing sites. Any risk areas identified by those audits are evaluated and appropriate steps are initiated to manage and reduce them. Any opportunities for improvement resulting from those assess-ments are evaluated and considered for implementation, including energy and water efficiency and conservation programs.
We maintain records and documentation relating to government inspections 
and share that information on a quarterly basis across sites to continually improve our EH&S management system. During the time period covered by this report, we received a number of awards related to our EH&S performance, including being named the U.S. National Most Valuable Pollution Prevention Awardee (MVP2 ) 2015. This has inspired our 
employees to further excel in these areas. We will share a few of their experi-ences with you in this report. 
ADI participates in the annual Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) EH&S 
performance metrics survey. We use the survey results to identify opportunities 
for improvement and benchmark performance with other industry leaders. 
Business 
This sustainability report examines the progress we have made toward our five-year goals in the following areas:
� Energy
� Emissions
� Water
� Waste� Materials
� Chemicals
� Land use and biodiversity� Regulatory compliance
� Occupational safety and health
In addition to absolute values, we calculate our emissions relative to our manufacturing production output (surface area of silicon processed ) 
and report those calculations as “normalized” emissions. With overall manufacturing volumes holding consistent, we have improved our efficiencies and thereby continue to reduce normalized emissions overall.
We routinely review measures of our performance relative to planned 
activities; those metrics indicate that we have successfully met our 2015 reduction goals in air emissions, and by forming programs around water consumption, waste generation, and energy use to continue to make progress toward our objectives. 12

 Reporting
Global Reporting Initiative
We considered the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines (G4) when preparing this report. A GRI content index is provided 
via a separate link at analog.com/sustainability. This index is provided to assist readers in locating information that may be found elsewhere on our website, including our Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K and our Annual Report, available at investor.analog.com. Detailed supporting information for our environmental, health, and safety activity is available at analog.com/EHS.
CDP—Carbon
ADI believes that, in addition to corresponding to our values and ethics, integrating climate change into our business strategy allows us to maintain a strategic advantage over our competitors in terms of transparency and sustainability. We demonstrate those attributes to customers, consumers, and the public by reporting our greenhouse gas emissions through the CDP , Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), Semiconductor Industry 
Association (SIA), and our public Sustainability Report. Our climate change 
strategy and implementation reinforces our commitment to the exemplary 
 13
Our Sustainability Priorities  u Environment analog.com/sustainability
environmental performance of our products and operations. ADI believes 
we also gain a market advantage with customers and other stakeholders who have a preference for socially responsible companies. 
Analog Devices has implemented short-term strategic changes that have 
positively influenced GHG emissions reduction performance. Climate change has influenced our short-term strategy by driving us to proactively reduce our GHG emissions through energy efficiency programs and by purchasing new equipment with tool-based abatement systems, helping us achieve our emissions reductions goals.
Climate change has influenced our long-term strategy in the way our 
buildings are designed to reduce electricity consumption—and therefore the emissions associated with our operations—and ultimately reduce the impact on the environment. Our emissions reduction target is linked to our business strategy. In order to meet that target, we completed the construction of two new buildings in 2015: one is LEED Platinum certified in Ireland, and the other is LEED Gold preregistered in the Philippines. As a company committed to reducing its environmental footprint, we aim to design our buildings and operations in accordance with LEED standards or other green building standards.
We also assess potential risks from climate change and associated potential 
impacts to our buildings and other assets by periodic visits and assessments performed by our insurer. As a result of recent natural disasters such as the Japan earthquake and tsunami, the Thailand flood, Typhoon Haiyan, and Typhoon Rammasun, we engaged an engineering firm to conduct a facility structural and integrity assessment every two months in one of our facilities located in a nearby area. Additionally, we intensively reviewed and strength-ened our Business Continuity Plans.
CDP—Water 
Water is essential to the operation of ADI facilities. Our 2015 goal of 5% reduction in normalized water use for all manufacturing sites has been and is actively monitored. In support of our goal, we explored and implemented new recycling and conservation activities such as those in the featured story below. We continue to work to maintain operations that comply with existing legal requirements and strive to stay abreast of changes that affect those requirements or our operations. We participate in industry consortia to stay up to date and proactively provide feedback on emerging and new regulations, including those affecting water supply and tariffs.
We manage potential risks associated with our operations through various 
methods. We monitor the occurrence of extreme weather events and natu-ral disasters and evaluate their potential impact to our operations. We have instituted business continuity plans and alternative sourcing arrangements to reduce impacts to the Company should these events occur. We have also utilized the results of risk assessments performed by our insurance companies to develop mitigation strategies to address those risks. Environmental, Health, and Safety Stewardship
Performance and Goals
Our EH&S management system provides for a quarterly senior management review of our activities. In addition, we conduct a monthly management review at the site level. Those reviews are critical in driving continual improvement and progress toward our goals. 
The close of 2015 marks the end of the timeframe of our 2015 normalized 
reduction goals of 5% for environmental metrics. After we finalize the 2020 EH&S goals, we will publicly disclose them.
Below is a summary of our performance against our 2010 baseline year.

Our normalized Scope 1 emissions were reduced by 9.6% from the baseline 
year. This decrease was driven primarily by the installation of tool-based abatement systems, which is a Company-initiated program to decrease our carbon footprint. Our normalized electricity and water consumption both increased by more than 6% compared to 2010. Those usages are attributed to expansion and growth of our operations. Waste generated at our manu-facturing sites increased from 2010 but our non-RCRA (nonhazardous waste ) 
recycling rate improved significantly from 38% to 61%.14
Our Sustainability Priorities  u Environment 201 4–2015 Sustainability Report
Air Emissions 
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are generated directly and indirectly 
are categorized into “scopes” based on the source of the emissions. The 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines Scope 1 emissions as direct from sources owned or controlled by the entity, including emissions from fossil fuels used on site. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that result from generating electricity, heating, and cooling offsite but purchased by the entity. 
Scope 3 emission sources include purchased goods and services; fuel and 
energy related activities not included in Scope 1 or 2; waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting; downstream transporta-tion and distribution; and end of life treatment of sold products. 
The primary source of our GHG emissions are chamber cleanings in plasma 
etch tools used in manufacturing. We voluntarily install abatement equipment on all newly purchased manufacturing tools and equipment that potentially emit GHGs. We continue to monitor and evaluate industry developments for continuous improvement. 
We emit perflourocarbons (PFCs ) from wafer fabrication processes and carbon 
dioxide (CO
2) from fuel combustion associated with power and heat generation. 
We report GHG information from our manufacturing sites to the CDP .
Water Use 
ADI uses water from public sources. A significant portion of our water is 
treated to produce the high purity deionized (DI) water necessary for our 
manufacturing operations. Our water consumption is carefully monitored at each of our operating facilities. We also track water use by normalizing it to our production processes.
ADI set a reduction target of 5% normalized water use by 2015 from our 
2010 baseline. ADI implemented water reuse and conservation programs across all of our manufacturing sites to achieve greater product output with reduced resource consumption. A substantial portion of water used in manu-facturing operations is reclaimed and recycled for reuse. Projects such as updating our wastewater system with new controls and chemical treatment ranges, recycling reverse osmosis process water, and replacing recycling systems are just a sampling of the efforts made to reduce our water use. In 2014 and 2015, 34% and 30%, respectively, of our withdrawn water was reused to support the Company’s operations. In 2015 alone, 96 million gallons of water were recycled.of water recycled96million
gallons
Waste Generation 
ADI has a program to recycle materials and avoid landfills or incinerators. We educate our employees on reducing solid waste generation both at home and in the workplace. We’ve also introduced comingled recycling collection, conducted an audit of all waste streams to identify additional materials that could be recycled, and increased recycling awareness programs for paper and beverage containers. Our non-RCRA (nonhazardous waste ) recycling rate 
improved significantly from 38% in 2010 to 61% in 2015.
Electricity Consumption
The highest demand for electricity in the Company comes from manufacturing tools. As such, we require all newly purchased manufacturing tools and equip-ment to meet minimum criteria for utilities consumption efficiency. In addition, we continue to monitor and evaluate industry developments for continuous improvement of energy utilization and efficiency. Our process equipment upgrades have resulted in more efficient use of energy. 
Despite the energy conservation and efficiency programs in place to 
support meeting our goal of 5% reduction, the expansion and growth of the Company resulted in a 6.8% increase in 2015 from 2010 levels. However, when measured in terms of our impact to the environment, that is in CO
2e, 
our Scope 2 emissions dropped by 10% in 2015 from 2010 baseline. This was driven by improvements in the energy mixes used in the grid, which improved emission factors.

Materials
ADI has eliminated Class I and Class II ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs ) in 
all of its incoming raw materials to minimize the release of ozone depleting 
substances, with reference to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. We also source materials that do not contain substances that are restricted in countries where our products are used— for example, by the European Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
(ROHS ), China RoHS, Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of 
Chemical Substances (REACH ), or the End of Life (ELV) Directive. ADI lead-free 
products are RoHS-compliant. The status of ADI lead-free and RoHS-compliant 
products is posted on our website. 
ADI designs products that make efficient use of raw materials to minimize 
material use. Additionally, design-for-environment concepts are incorporated to use alternative chemical constituents in our products. We also minimize quantities of incoming packaging materials to reduce waste. 
We have a Product Life Cycle program that aims to extend the useful life 
of our products. We believe obsolescence should be avoided as long as technology and customer demand exist. Additionally, we have established a program for the return of evaluation boards from customers for recycling. That program provides step-by-step instructions for customers, and is in keeping with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE ) Directive.
Pollution Prevention
A key component of ADI’s approach to environmental management is pollution prevention. Pollution prevention practices are incorporated into manufacturing operations.
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan: Locations of materials and 
industrial activities that are potentially exposed to rainwater and snow melt are included in our stormwater prevention plan to promote application and improvement of appropriate pollution prevention and best management practices. We have built enclosures to protect transportation-associated loading and unloading activities, waste roll-off containers, and solid waste/recycling compactors. Our inspection program includes visual monitoring and sampling to promote effectiveness of the plan.
Hazardous Materials Contingency Plan: This plan is designed to prevent and 
minimize hazards to public health, safety, or welfare of the environment by fires, explosions, spills, or any other unplanned release of hazardous wastes, hazardous waste constituents, or hazardous materials to the air, soil, surface water, or groundwater. This plan is incorporated in the emergency preparedness and response requirements in the ADI ISO 14001/OHSAS 18001 environmental, health, and safety management system.Oil Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC ) Plan: This plan 
features prevention and control technology to reduce the likelihood of a discharge of oil from a site or facility.
Biodiversity and Natural Resources
ADI does not have a significant amount of land associated with its facilities, and our operations generally do not pose a significant risk to the terrestrial biodiversity in the areas surrounding our facilities. ADI’s manufacturing facilities discharge pretreated wastewater to publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities that are permitted for operation in each of the jurisdictions. Those treatment facilities help mitigate water quality impacts and associated water biodiversity risks.
Earth Day Celebrations
In support of our EH&S Community Program, ADI Philippines joined the Clean-Up and Tree Planting activity of MENRO/Municipal of Environment and Natural Resources in April 2014 and 2015. Bagras trees were planted by the employee-volunteers in the General Trias Sports Park in 2014. Growing trees were also planted along the riverside in 2015, the roots of which help stabilize and reinforce the river banks.
Water Conservation
ADI has implemented several water use reduction initiatives that have resulted in nearly 90 million gallons per year of water savings. ADI’s implementation of innovative water reduction and reclaim measures allowed our Massachusetts facility to double production without increasing water use, thereby allowing an important local employer to remain in New England.
Water use is yet another example of sustainability making good business 
sense: the reductions referenced above equate to over $1 million dollars in avoided costs. Additionally, by significantly reducing resource needs, ADI has been able to nearly double production without increasing water resources, thereby avoiding facility expansion costs and retaining local jobs.16
Our Sustainability Priorities  u Environment 201 4–2015 Sustainability Report
Energy
ADI has implemented numerous energy reduction initiatives that have 
resulted in over 16 million kWh per year savings. 
Examples of our energy reduction projects include: 
� Steam trap upgrades
� Compressor upgrades
� Air handling unit filter upgrades
� Installing variable speed 
drives (VFDs )� Chiller plant optimization
� Central utility plant optimization
� Lighting retrofits to high efficiency lampsEnergy reductions realized from these projects equate to over $1 million in 
avoided costs. 
Chemical Reduction
ADI has successfully implemented greener chemistry initiatives and 
process improvements to significantly reduce use of toxic chemicals. These efforts have resulted in ADI being recognized as an industry leader 
by the Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute.

Analog Devices and the Ipswich River Watershed Association: Five Years of Impact
Analog Devices generously committed a five-year pledge of $10,000 per 
year to the Ipswich River Watershed Association to leverage additional funding to dramatically increase its capacity to protect and restore the river as called for in its recently completed five-year Strategic Plan. At the time, the organization was a small and effective three-person operation with much bigger aspirations: to fully restore the Ipswich River to its natural state on behalf of future generations. 
Buoyed by Analog Devices’ commitment, the Ipswich River Watershed 
Association was able to successfully secure similar sized pledges from 
two additional local corporate supporters and more recently a third donor has joined this effort. With these generous donations the watershed can continue to work toward its ambitious river restoration strategy. With this invaluable gift the vision of a fully restored river for people and nature seems more possible than ever. 
The following are some of the specific achievements made possible due 
in part to Analog Devices investment in the Ipswich River:
� Produced a detailed River Restoration Action Plan for the river to guide our work� Surveyed and assessed more than 1000 man-made structures 
(bridges, culverts, etc. ) that restrict fish and wildlife movements and 
obstruct the natural flow of the river and its tributaries throughout the 
watershed
� Secured funding for the removal and/or improved fish passage at all three of the mainstream dams on the river, which will make the Ipswich the only free flowing river in eastern Massachusetts
� Reduced the impact of water withdrawals overall and halted the decades-long trend of declining river flows such that the flow regime in the river has begun to improve
� Led the statewide effort to enact the nationally recognized Massachusetts Sustainable Water Management Initiative based in part on the ground-breaking research in the Ipswich
� Water used by businesses and certain households has been reduced dramatically
� Grew the organization from 350 to over 1000 active members, doubled the size of the budget, and increased staffing to six employeesCommunity Contributions
ADI is committed to the communities in and around where we operate. Much of the company’s volunteer, philanthropic, and community investment activities are managed at the site level and many are initiated by employees who have a passion for their causes. This approach not only ensures that our very active employee base is able to remain involved, but also allows them to determine how best to leverage ADI resources given the needs of the specific communi-ties in which they live and work, and the specific organizations to which they volunteer their time and donate funds. We are continually impressed with the energy and dedication that our employees exhibit in giving back to society, protecting the environment, and providing for those in need, and we support them in their efforts. One way we do this is through the company’s Matching Gifts Program, which provides employees a voice in how ADI distributes a por -
tion of its charitable donations. Employees who make donations to charitable causes can have their gifts matched by the company.Like most companies, we receive several hundred requests for funding each year. We target programs that benefit the communities where our employees live and work.
The Corporate Contributions Program
Each year, Analog Devices donates to human services, art and cultural 
organizations, community organizations, and environmental organiza-tions through its Community Contributions Program.
Matching Grants to Education
This program was created as part of Analog Devices’ overall Education 
Support Strategy. ADI has made an ongoing commitment to the support of education in the belief that a well educated population is critical to suc-cess in a global economy. All accredited secondary schools, colleges, and universities are eligible to receive matching grants under this program. 27 analog.com/sustainability

For over 50 years, our employees have made a difference in the com-munities where we operate. In support of employees’ generosity, we provide a matching gift program that enables employees to receive a match for their financial contributions to nonprofits. The goal of this program is to give ADI employees a say in how the company distributes a portion of its charitable donations. Certified nonprofit organizations are eligible to receive matching gifts if they are not primarily religious or political in purpose, and if their services are available to all individuals on an equal basis. In addition, we support the cultural organizations in the greater Boston area where we operate our corporate headquarters and employ several thousand people.

RadioVerse: Customer Engagement
ADI’s new RadioVerse™ technology and design ecosystem was 
developed with our customers and customers’ customers in mind. 
It helps them solve the problems of the wireless connectivity revolution and helps balance the equation that the enormous demand for data has placed on today’s technology. Ideal for applications in many wireless communications applications as well as electronic test and measurement equipment, the RadioVerse ecosystem was developed utilizing ADI’s system-focused mindset to impactful innovation and delivers a versatile solution that goes beyond silicon and greatly simplifies the radio system. RadioVerse provides customers with integrated transceiver technologies, a robust design environment, and market-specific technical expertise to move their radio designs from concept to creation quickly. This is especially important as in recent years, due to the complexity involved with RF design, manufacturers have limited resources to develop in-house and have begun looking for complete RF designs that allow them to get to market quickly.

European R&D Centre Limerick, Ireland—LEED for 
New Construction: Community Environment/Business Industry Engagement
We have made a commitment that all new construction will be green build-
ings and conform to the current sustainable standards. Our European R&D center illustrates our commitment. In the construction of the new building in Limerick, ADI’s sustainability priorities were to conserve energy, water, and natural resources, support eco-friendly technologies, improve operating controls, and lower operational costs. On a holistic level, the building aims to support a healthy lifestyle and positive workplace. To reduce pollution during construction, control measures and practices limited sediment and debris entering the local stormwater systems and airborne pollution. Filters were fitted to drains, the drains were regularly inspected and cleaned, dust was suppressed, vehicle wheels were washed before leaving the site, and excavation stockpiles were covered to prevent erosion and pollution. Additionally, 23% of the site area is now vegetated, creating a healthier neighborhood and promoting biodiversity.
The site has increased filtration, permeable paving, and planting designed 
to capture and infiltrate stormwater before it reaches the public drain. Rain is collected from the roof in a tank under the car park and used to flush the lavatories, resulting in a water savings of 71%. In addition, efficient indoor lavatory fittings result in a 58% reduction in water use. The building’s central glass atrium and large windows contribute high levels of natural daylight, increasing connection with outdoor environment and reducing reliance on artificial lighting. There are a mixture of highly efficient fluorescent and LED lamps within the light fixtures and the combination of smart automated and user controls allow precise control of systems. As a result, the building’s interior lighting saves more than 100,000 kWh a year compared to a typical lighting installation.
The building also has an efficient air conditioning system designed to 
improve operating controls and lower operational costs and an albedo roof uses a finish that reflects the sun’s energy. The white and light colored finish surfaces used for this roof and the landscaped areas reflect solar radiation and limit heat build-up to reduce carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions. There is also a solar panel array on the roof that generates 9,400 kWh of thermal energy annually. To conserve natural resources, more than 90% of all new wood used in the building is Forest Steward Council (FSC) certified, meaning the wood was harvested 
without contributing to the destruction of the world’s forests. Additionally, many of the products used to construct and furnish the building contain recycled content. Supporting eco-friendly technologies, the site features 12 electric vehicle charging points provided and 33 secure cycle storage spaces. As carpooling also helps the environment, there are 21 dedicated carpooling spaces in a prime location close to the entrance.94

ADI University Program: Student Engagement
Analog Devices is as passionate about educating the next generation of 
engineers as it is about pioneering the next technological breakthroughs. Our university program includes research funding, student donations, and education kits and curriculum.
We provide funding to universities and research centers around the world. 
Our funding supports basic research, graduate and doctoral student projects, laboratory equipment and facilities, and collaborative research and development initiatives. ADI research funding creates lasting partnerships with universities and research centers at the leading edge of science and technology. Rapid innovation in technology is made possible in part due to the advanced research underway at research universities and research centers. Funding and productive engagement with these organizations fuels the innovation engine which has lasting impact to economic growth. 
We believe hands-on education is impactful in education, helping students 
develop a passion for electronics and the skills to succeed. To this end, we deeply discount and often donate our products so that individual students and student teams can design, test, and build circuits and applications from actual components.
In the last several years, we combined our experience teaching about 
analog and digital signal processing and our relationships with professors and educational institutions to devise a new curriculum that features a new learning kit. The Analog Devices Active Learning M1000 (M1K) Kit is 
a hands-on, easy to use tool that allows students to be introduced to the fundamentals of electrical engineering in a self- or instructor-led setting. Using our kit, students build and test real-world, functional analog circuits that help them better understand how the physical world and the digital world interact. We also provide teachers and students with coursework and lab experiments. Early hands-on learning with the M1K helps students develop a solid science, technology, or engineering foundation.We encourage our employees to mentor and tutor students. We also host student design competitions to help build important skills such as ideation, teamwork, and communications. 
Over our 50-year history, we have been able to see the benefits of investing 
in education and basic research. We have benefited directly by hiring excel-lent talent and being able to apply research findings. And we have benefited indirectly through the growing ranks of STEM degree holding graduates working for our customers and building new companies. We believe the long-term impacts are clear, providing students with the skills needed to lead the world to the next generation of innovative breakthroughs.Featured University Program International Solid State 
Circuits Conference (ISSCC )
Since 1997, Analog Devices has honored 
talented students at top research universi-
ties with Outstanding Student Designer Awards. The awards are presented at the International Solid State Circuits Conference 
(ISSCC ) held in San Francisco, CA.
This award helps to encourage the 
study of integrated circuit (IC) design, 
recognize graduate students who have both chosen this field early in their academic careers and who show great promise and tal-ent. Students who are selected for Outstanding Student Designer Awards receive a stipend to help them travel to the prestigious conference.
ADI engineers work with university professors, asking them to 
nominate their best students for the awards. Once at the ISCCC, the students meet with their ADI champions to discuss IC design and related topics.

Our Sustainability Priorities  u Go vernance and Ethics 2014–2015 Sustainability Report
Governance and Ethics
Corporate Governance
“We strive to be a positive inﬂuence in our communities
 by living up to the highest ethical standards, pursuing
 socially minded business practices, providing rewarding 
career and employment opportunities, and giving back
 to our communities in concert with our employees’ individual efforts.” 
–Vincent Roche, CEO
The Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc., sets high standards for the 
Company’s employees, officers, and directors. Implicit in Analog Devices’ philosophy is the importance of sound corporate governance. It is the duty of the Board of Directors to serve as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and to oversee the management of our business. To fulfill its responsibilities and to discharge its duty, the Board of Directors follows the procedures and stan-dards set forth in the Corporate Governance guidelines. These guidelines are subject to modification from time to time as the Board of Directors deems appropriate in the best interests of the Company or as required by applicable laws and regulations.
Governance Structure
Our Board of Directors’ primary responsibility is to serve the best interests of ADI and its shareholders by overseeing the management of the company. The Board reviews ADI’s overall performance, rather than the day-to-day operations that are the responsibility of management. The Board determines corporate objectives and strategies. It also evaluates and approves signifi-cant policies and proposed major commitments of corporate resources. The Board of Directors’ role in the Company’s risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from members of senior management on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal and regulatory, and strategic and reputational risks. Members of management report to the Board of Directors (or appropriate committees in certain cases ) 
regarding risk identification, risk management, and risk mitigation strate-gies. In particular, the Audit Committee discusses ADI’s policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management as they apply to ADI’s financial statements. The Audit Committee also receives regular reports from our Director of Internal Audit on internal audit matters, and an annual report from our Chief Information Officer on cybersecurity. The Compensation Committee considers whether ADI’s executive compensation program encourages excessive or inappropriate risk taking, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee leads the Board with respect to the adequacy of succession planning for the Company’s Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, and other executive officers, while issues related to governance and to ethics are handled by the Nominating and Governance Committee.
The Board is currently comprised of 10 board members. Ray Stata (chair-
man), presiding director, Vincent T. Roche (CEO), and eight other independent 
directors: Richard M. Beyerm, James A. Champy, Bruce R. Evans, Edward H. 
Frank, John C. Hodgson, Neil Novich, Kenton J. Sicchitano, and Lisa T. Su. The Board has standing Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, each comprised entirely of independent directors. The names, titles, and affiliations of our Board members, as well as the structure and membership of committees are described in our proxy state-ments and on our investor relations website.39
Governance and Ethics  u Environment analog.com/sustainability
Accountability and Transparency
As part of our commitment to accountability and transparency, every 
member of our Board is elected annually, giving our shareholders input into the membership of our entire Board every year. The results of each election are publicly announced within four business days of the election. In addition, we have a majority voting standard in the election of direc-tors. If a nominee in an uncontested election does not receive more votes “for” his or her election than “against,” that director must offer his or her resignation to the Board promptly after the election. The Board then determines whether to accept the resignation, after consideration of all relevant factors. We then publicly disclose the Board’s decision and an explanation of how the decision was reached.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board 
oversees an annual written evaluation of the Board to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively. As part of this evalua-tion, individual Board members are assessed by both themselves and the other Board members. Information related to ADI director and execu-tive compensation is contained in our annual proxy statement under the headers “Director Compensation” and “Information About Executive Compensation.” The 2016 Annual Proxy statement is a Featured Report on our investor relations website. 
To align the interests of our directors and executives with those of our 
stockholders, we have in place stock ownership guidelines. Under the guidelines, target share ownership levels are two times the annual cash retainer for directors, two times annual base salary for the CEO, and one times annual base salary for other executives. Directors (including the CEO ) 
have three years to achieve their target level. Executives (other than the 
CEO) have five years to achieve their target level. We prohibit all hedging transactions or “short sales” involving ADI securities by our directors and employees, including our executive officers.
Independence
We have 10 directors. Eight of the directors meet the NASDAQ independence standards, which are currently reaffirmed by the Board annually. The Board has determined that Mr. Roche, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Stata, our Chairman and founder, are not “independent” under the NASDAQ rules because Mr. Roche is a current employee and Mr. Stata is our founder. Our independent directors meet regularly in executive session outside the presence of the two management directors. We have an inde-pendent presiding director, James Champy, who presides at all executive sessions of our independent directors. In addition, we separate the roles of CEO and chairman of the board in recognition of the differences between the two roles. The CEO is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the company and the day to day leadership and performance of the company, while the chairman of the board sets the agenda for board meetings and presides over meetings of the full board. Additional information on ADI’s board of directors can be found on our investor relations website.
Integrity and Ethical Behavior
We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to everyone who works for ADI. This includes the CEO, the CFO, members of ADI’s board, other senior financial, business, and technical management, and every employee. We have established a toll-free business ethics hotline operated by an independent third party, where anyone can report any violations of the code, questionable accounting or auditing matters, or violations of any law or regulation. We have a no retaliation policy against any employee who in good faith makes a report or assists ADI in identifying or investigating suspected violations of the law or the code.40
Our Sustainability Priorities  u Go vernance and Ethics 2014–2015 Sustainability Report
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee coordinates the board’s 
oversight of the code, and all employees are required to take a mandatory training course on the code. For additional information on our policies or to view a copy of the code, please visit our investor relations website.
Respect for Stakeholder Interests
The Board of Directors gives appropriate attention to written communications on issues that are submitted by shareholders and other interested parties, and responds as appropriate. Absent unusual circumstances or as contem-plated by committee charters, the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will, with the assistance of Analog Devices’ internal 
legal counsel, (1) be primarily responsible for monitoring communications from 
shareholders and other interested parties and (2) provide copies or summaries 
of such communications to the other directors as he considers appropriate. Communications will be forwarded to all directors if they relate to substan-tive matters and include suggestions or comments that the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers to be important for the directors to review. In general, communications relating to corporate governance and long-term corporate strategy are more likely to be forwarded than communications relating to personal grievances, commercial solicitations, and matters as to which Analog Devices tends to receive repetitive or duplica-
tive communications.
Shareholders may also recommend director candidates for inclusion in the 
slate of nominees that the board recommends to our shareholders for elec-tion. The qualifications of recommended candidates will be reviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee using substantially the same process and applying substantially the same criteria as it follows for director candidates submitted by board members. The criteria for nomination as a director are contained in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and include the candidate’s integrity, business acumen, experience, commitment, diligence, conflicts of interest, and the ability to act in the presence of all shareholders. 
Shareholders and other interested parties who wish to send communica-
tions on any topic to the board should address such communications to

Supplier Diversity 
In the United States, public laws and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 
govern the requirements for small business subcontracting programs and the procurement goals for each program. The small business goals for each business type are listed below in relation to percentage of procure-ment spend. ADI and other suppliers who sell to the U.S. government or to suppliers of the U.S. government are required to report spending in these categories as a percentage of overall spending every six months.

The percentage of spend with small businesses was down slightly in 2014 
and 2015. This is partly due to the activities involved in the integration of the corporation Hittite, which ADI acquired during this time period. In addition, a large percentage of spend was directed primarily to larger corporations for software licenses and services. However, if you look at the categories of Small Disadvantaged Business and Women Owned Small Business, the percentage of spend with both of these business types were just over 3% in 2015, which is closer to the 5% spend goal than in previous years.

Our Sustainability Priorities  u Go vernance and Ethics analog.com/sustainability
Business Ethics
“Our commitment to innovation, collaboration, excellence
 in everything we do, and an intense passion for enabling
 customer success are the essence of ADI and will be long into the future. These tenets stem from a strong value system that emphasizes honesty, integrity, and respect. Ethical behavior has always been part of the fabric of our company and our ongoing vigilance and commitment to this principle will ensure that ADI’s
 reputation as a reliable and trusted company endures.
 It remains critical that all employees, across all locations and job functions, understand the importance of ethical behavior, including complying with applicable laws and ADI policies and procedures.” 
–Vincent Roche, CEO
As employees of Analog Devices, it is our collective responsibility to uphold 
our company’s reputation for the highest standards of integrity and corporate governance. We make it a priority to provide employees with comprehensive training on ethics and compliance to help each person make sound decisions in today’s complex, global environment by providing critical information about the policies and laws that govern both the company’s activities and the actions of individual employees while working on behalf of ADI.
EICC
ADI follows the EICC Code of Conduct; we verify our conformance by engaging third-party audit entities accredited by the EICC to conduct Auditee-Managed Audits (AMAs ) at our manufacturing facilities. Audit results, along with 
corrective actions plans and updates, are uploaded on the EICC-ON platform; ADI customers who are also EICC member companies, or are subscribed to EICC-ON, can request access to our audit results. 
Pursuant to local laws, ADI respects the right of all workers to form and join 
trade unions of their own choosing, to bargain collectively and to engage in peaceful assembly, as well as respecting the right of workers to refrain from such activities. ADI allows workers and/or their representatives to openly communicate and share ideas and concerns with management regarding working conditions and management practices without fear of discrimina-tion, reprisal, intimidation, or harassment.Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics describes our expectations and requirements for all company employees, including executive officers, as well as members of the Board of Directors, contractors, and business partners. We expect all directors, officers, and employees—as well as nonemployee sales representatives, consultants, vendors, suppliers, and customers engaged in business activities with ADI—to comply with the law in the course of their relationship with ADI, including all applicable statutes, rules, and regulations. 
The Code is posted on Signals, ADI’s employee portal, and on our website.  
It is provided to all new employees and distributed annually to all employees. 
It is reviewed for necessary changes or amendments on an annual basis by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors. All employees are required to take a mandatory online course covering the Code and to recertify thereafter.
Fair Competition and Pricing
ADI and its employees do not discuss prices or customers with our competitors except when necessary in connection with legitimate sales or purchase transactions. In addition, ADI and its personnel do not fix or dictate resale prices to our distributors or pressure resale price maintenance by reprimanding or threatening distributors who reduce their prices. We are fair in our dealings with our distributors and do not restrict our distributors’ rights to sell our products, nor do we seek to prevent our distributors from selling our competitors’ products. We do not discriminate among similar distributors when we offer price discounts.
Insider Trading
Our policy regarding the trading of securities is applicable to all ADI personnel, as well as our Board of Directors. All employees must participate in training regarding the laws of insider trading. Appropriate employees are required to take a 30-minute mandatory online course covering our insider trading rules. Appropriate employees are reminded quarterly via email of their obligation to refrain from trading in Company stock until the third business day following the public announcement of ADI’s financial results for that quarter.
Anticorruption
We work to comply with all applicable anticorruption and antibribery laws in all countries where we do business. Our Guidelines for Gifts and Business Entertainment, which prohibit the giving of anything of value to a government official with the purpose of influencing his or her decision or gaining an improper benefit, apply to all ADI personnel.42
Our Sustainability Priorities  u Go vernance and Ethics 2014–2015 Sustainability Report
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits the direct or indirect 
payment or gift of corporate funds or other assets to any political party or committee, to any candidate for public office, and to any official or employee of any government agency in the United States or any foreign country. This applies to employees or persons acting on behalf of ADI, its divisions, and its subsidiaries. It also extends to any payment or gift granted to a third party in which there is an understanding or presump-tion that part, or all, of the payment or gift may ultimately be paid to any political party or committee, candidate for public office, governmental official, or employee. For example, our matching gifts program does not extend to organizations that are primarily political in purpose. Nevertheless, employees are free to get involved in politics as long as it is not in connec-tion with ADI or ADI business and is conducted during personal time. 
We pay dues for associations and membership organizations, such as the 
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), that may engage in lobbying 
efforts.
Export Controls
ADI monitors and strives to comply with the export regulations of the United States and of other countries in which ADI conducts business. In 2013, we provided training on export laws, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Export Administration Regulations, to all appropriate employees. In 2015, we asked all ADI employees to read and certify their understanding of our ADI Export Policy statement. Starting in 2016, we are planning to deliver function-specific export training to all ADI employees and deliver refresher training every two years thereafter. 
Reporting Violations
We have several avenues through which employees and stakeholders can report potential violations of laws, rules, regulations, and Company policies. We have an open-door policy with regard to issues that may arise under the Code or about potential violations. Employees may bring these issues to their supervisors or contact the Human Resources Department or ADI’s Chief Legal Officer.
In addition, we have a toll-free number and an email box through which 
employees may anonymously report any potential violation. Following a report, the ADI Legal Department conducts an investigation appropriate for the situation. Anonymous reports and the results of any investigation are reported to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. For more information regarding reporting of violations please view our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.No Retaliation
We do not discipline, discriminate against, or retaliate against any employee who reports a complaint or concern in good faith.
“Analog Devices is committed to sound ethical practices,
 strong corporate governance, and full compliance with
 all applicable laws and regulations. ADI’s culture of transparency at all levels is at the foundation of the company’s business success. Accordingly, ADI expects honest, ethical, and lawful conduct from all its personnel throughout the organization.”

prison labor. All work must be voluntary and workers are always free to leave upon reasonable notice. Our workers are not required to hand over government-issued identification, passports, or work permits to our facility representatives as a condition of employment.
Child Labor Avoidance
ADI does not use child labor at any stage of manufacturing. We use the 
EICC Code of Conduct definition of “child”: any person under the age of 15 
(or 14 where the law of the country permits ), or under the age for complet-
ing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment 
in the country, whichever is greatest. The use of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programs, which comply with all laws and regulations, is supported by ADI. Workers cannot perform work that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety.
Freedom of Association
ADI regards open communication and direct engagement between workers 
and management to be the most effective ways to resolve workplace and compensation issues. ADI respects the rights of workers to associate freely and seek to communicate openly with management regarding working conditions without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. Globally, approximately 2% of our employees belong to unions.
Supply Chain
ADI designs, manufactures, and markets a broad line of high performance integrated circuits (ICs) that incorporate analog, mixed-signal, and digital 
signal processing technologies. We produce and market several thousand products. Information on our products can be found in our latest Form 10-K report filed with the SEC and posted on our website. 
Suppliers
Our goal is to develop a meaningful and lasting relationship with ADI suppliers. Our products require a wide variety of components, raw materi-als, and external foundry, assembly, and test services, much of which ADI 44
Our Sustainability Priorities  u Go vernance and Ethics 2014–2015 Sustainability Report
purchases from third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for many 
of the components and materials that are purchased and incorporated into our products. However, a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers—primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
The ADI Purchasing Council has a procedure for purchasing materials from 
its suppliers. Approximately 40 of the material suppliers are considered to be key suppliers. Where appropriate, raw materials and critical indirect materi-als are either dual sourced or have an identified second source.
The ADI Purchasing Council, in conjunction with the Subcontractor 
Management Organization, oversees the work of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and the test and assembly subcontractors in Asia. ADI has developed a series of specifications to define the ADI Supplier Management Policy for materials and services.
ADI has initiated a policy of performing FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ) 
checks on all new suppliers being added to ADI’s supplier master file. ADI 
also provides all new suppliers with a copy of the ADI Ethics statement and requests acknowledgment from the supplier.
ADI suppliers must demonstrate proven quality, effective process controls, 
financial stability, competitive pricing, on-time delivery, and commitment to continual improvement in all aspects of their business.
Suppliers are audited for conformance with ADI requirements and other 
purchasing conditions. This audit schedule is determined based on a risk management process. All new suppliers are audited prior to their acceptance. 
Conflict Minerals
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 requires companies to publicly disclose their use of minerals that originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country, 
termed “conflict minerals.” The regulatory reform law directed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC ) to issue rules requiring 
certain companies to disclose their use of conflict minerals that include tantalum, tin, gold, or tungsten if those minerals are “necessary to the functionality or production of a product” manufactured by those compa-nies. Congress enacted Section 1502 of the Act because of concerns that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals by armed groups is helping to finance conflict in the DRC region and is contributing to an emergency humanitarian crisis. 
Companies are required to provide this disclosure on a new form to be filed 
with the SEC called Form SD (Specialized Disclosure Report ); the very first 
of which were required to be filed with the SEC on or before June 2, 2014 for calendar year 2013. ADI submitted its Form SD to the SEC May 30, 2014; a copy of our filing is available in the Investor Relations page of our website. ADI adopted the framework of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas to facilitate responsible sourcing, and fulfill the reporting obligations related to DRC conflict minerals. 
Our Conflict Minerals policy, available on our website at http://www.analog.
com/static/imported-files/corporate/Analog_Devices_Conflict_Minerals_Policy_Statement.pdf, is a key component of our management system: 
� it reflects ADI’s commitment to ethical practices and compliance with applicable laws and regulations,
� it includes ADI’s actions on collaborating with other concerned electronics companies, under the EICC-GeSI Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI), 
in developing methods to track the origin of tantalum, tungsten, tin, and gold (3TG) used in the manufacture of electronic products, 
� it reflects ADI’s support of the Conflict-Free Smelter Program (CFSP ) in 
assessing activities, processes, and systems used by the Smelter or Refiner (SOR) facility to conduct upstream supply chain due diligence of 
minerals for conflict-affected and high risk areas, and
� it is communicated to ADI’s supply chain with the expectation of compliance with this conflict minerals policy, and for the suppliers to provide sourcing information using the EICC-GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template as standard.
Supplier Awards Program
Each year, ADI holds a Supplier Awards Program event in Hong Kong. The Purchasing Department conducts quarterly ratings of delivery and quality of their respective suppliers. ADI has a specification document to standardize a method of providing suppliers with positive feedback and the motivation to constantly strive toward continual improvement. We publicly recognize those suppliers whose excellence has made a significant contribution toward ADI achieving our corporate goals and objectives.
The categories for the awards are: raw materials, critical indirect materials, 
contracted production, maintenance/service of front-end capital equip-ment, maintenance/service of back-end capital equipment, and special achievement.

Safety
ADI has pioneered solutions for automotive airbag, stability, and rollover 
systems for more than 20 years. Our extensive experience in designing crash sensors enabled us to help define next-generation airbag products for electronic control unit (ECU) and satellite sensors, and high perfor -
mance gyroscopes and low-g sensors for electronic stability control. ADI’s products enable next-generation systems that offer consumers the highest level of safety.
A
2B
Analog Devices is also helping to solve the entertainment system design 
challenges with the Automotive Audio Bus® (A2B) digital audio bus technol-
ogy, which delivers high fidelity audio for automobiles while significantly reducing the weight of existing cable harnesses (by upward of 75% in key 
applications )—resulting in improved vehicle fuel efficiency.
The A
2B system takes out the complexity, weight, and costs of current 
systems. But it also adds in an advanced, feature-rich infotainment experi-ence that car manufacturers, and millions of drivers, increasingly expect—along with better gas mileage.
Leading automotive manufacturers approached ADI about developing tech-
nology that could support multiple microphone arrays in vehicles to enable different applications such as voice recognition, active noise cancellation, and in-car communications.
Traditional implementations for high fidelity audio in automobiles required a 
large amount of expensive, heavy cabling. ADI set about it in a better way—the AD2410 and the A
2B solution, which is capable of distributing audio and 
control data together with clock and power over a single, unshielded, low cost twisted-pair wire.
A
2B connects multiple remote sensors for different applications in a daisy-
chain sequence, significantly reducing redundant cabling runs. As a result, 
the weight of the cable harness is reduced dramatically, while overall design costs and complexity (in design, installation, and maintenance ) are reduced 
due to the need for fewer cables. The A
2B technology can also supply power 
to other devices in the daisy chain, eliminating the need for local power supplies and further reducing total system cost.ADI at the Forefront of Science
Earlier this year, scientists at Caltech and MIT announced that they had discovered gravitational waves, thereby verifying another aspect of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. The gravitational waves were discovered by the two LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ) observa-
tories located in Washington and Louisiana. The LIGO devices can measure a change in the length of the laser beam arms to less than the width of a proton. Several operational amplifiers from ADI, of the AD797 type, are at the center of the measurement equipment and keep the laser beams extremely stable to allow such precise readings. The AD797 was chosen from hundreds of avail-able devices as the most accurate and low noise amplifier available. Several other ADI products are also used in the LIGO systems, entirely because of the precision and accuracy that they provide.

The Internet of Things—IoT
The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a term to describe how disconnected devices 
that have or need information will be connected into a local home, factory, or office network to improve efficiency. Many such devices are already in use, such as security cameras, remote lighting, and even smart watches doing medical monitoring. The primary elements of all of these devices are sensors acquiring data and radios that transmit the data or receive commands. ADI is well positioned in this area with our strength in sensors and data acquisition as well as the breadth of RF and communications products, recently enhanced with the acquisition of Hittite Microwave. To focus on this area, in 2015, we formed the IoT operating division whose products will be targeted on exactly that area, and build on successes we have already achieved in personal, industrial, and medical systems.
MEMS  Accelerometers
Our MEMS accelerometers are now becoming  
an important tool as vibration sensors in  
modern, IoT driven, condition monitoring  
(CM) systems. CM developers have long  
awaited the opportunity to leverage the size,  
cost, and reliability advantages in MEMS   
sensors, but until recently have been limited  by their measurement range, bandwidth, or resolution. Recent advances in products like the ADXL357 are addressing these traditional  
weaknesses, while at the same time, new CM  
architectures (IoT) are emerging to automate  
the entire process of vibration monitoring  
(sensing, data capture, cloud connectivity,  
security, analytics, and action triggering ). This convergence of sensor and system-level  capability is leading to significant expansion of  vibration sensing instrumentation, especially into  
factories that presently have little or no coverage  
for critical machines. System designers can  
develop a machine vibration signature that  
indicates when it is nearing a point where  
maintenance is required to prevent failure.  
This allows machines to be serviced when it is needed, rather than on an arbitrary schedule,  but still preventing costly major failures. This  will save time and money for manufacturers and transportation systems of all types.

ADPD Photometric Front Ends for Medical Applications
ADI has developed a series of photonics devices for medical monitoring. 
These devices consist of an LED (light emitting diode ) and a photorecep-
tor diode, along with light filters. These devices are typically installed on the back of a watch or other device strapped to a skin surface. The emit-ted light is reflected by the skin or internal tissue. The amount of reflected light or the ratio of multiple light frequencies can discern certain medical parameters. Pulse rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) devices are already being sold by our customers, and other useful medical parameters are being developed. This is useful for fitness monitoring as well as general medical conditions.
Camera Shake Reduction Devices—ADI Helps Keep Your Photos Sharp
For many years, ADI has provided a series of products that are used to autofocus the lens in cameras from cell phones to high end digital SLRs. In the past couple of years, we have added the ability to stabilize the lens against camera movement. These products, such as the ADXRS290, sense movement or rotation of the camera body and counter this by moving the small capsule holding the lens. The result is an image focused on the backplane sensor that doesn’t move while the shutter is open. These devices are being used in high end cameras as well as in medical scanners to provide better resolution in diagnostic images. Newer appli-cations include virtual reality headsets.

ADI has adopted a strategy of storing most finished product in warehouse operations that are either adjacent to or in regional proximity to the facilities where the parts finish the manufacturing process, allowing us to ship from these operations directly to our customers and distributors. In conjunction with our regional warehouse strategy, ADI has focused on reducing the transit points for shipment to our end customers in all regions. We continue to focus on streamlined flows to improve the efficiency of our transportation flows in conjunction with our transportation partners for reduction of emis-sions in global supply chain logistics. Exceptions to this occur only when service level requirements necessitate local stocking. In addition, we actively pursue efficiencies by consolidating all customer shipments to a given region to the extent possible. 
For the transportation managed by ADI, the company partners with a limited 
and select number of transportation service providers. We rely on these companies making the investments required to develop sustainability best practices, and we believe that they have active, robust programs in place. 
Packaging
Properly packaging our products to adequately protect them against damage during transit is critical. While safeguarding our product is key, we strive to achieve this without adding unnecessary extra packaging, or fill content. Our warehouse operations team has developed a goal of continu-ous waste reduction through development of a paperless environment initiative using RF wireless technology where applicable in our distribution centers. Additional programs to reduce our packaging footprint for our products have resulted in significant reductions in paper usage throughout our logistics supply chain. We continue to employ a lean approach in both our internal and external partner warehouses and our transportation suppliers for reduction of waste. It is our aim wherever possible to use materials that can be fully recycled by the recipient. Packing and shipping operations are also reviewed to reduce paper generation, printing only those forms that are essential to the process. For inbound shipments, ADI utilizes approved partners for recycling of packaging materials.50
