2014 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTPRESIDENT'S LETTER
In 2014, six 12-year-old girls 
from Resaca Middle School  
in Los Fresnos, Texas, won Best in Nation in the Verizon Innovative App Challenge. The girls invented an app called “Hello Navi” to help a visually impaired classmate better navigate the halls of their school. Their success took them all the way to the White House Science Fair in Washington, DC, hosted by President Barack Obama. Global Corporate Citizenship:  
The Heart of Verizon
“Not only do these young ladies have 
big brains, ” said the President, “but they also have big hearts. ” 
The President was so right. I’m constantly inspired by the people 
we help through our programs such as these amazing young ladies. 
Through my work with the Verizon 
Foundation, I have had an incredible opportunity to work with a group of passionate and committed individuals. Together, we’re dedicated to putting Verizon’s assets to good use by providing experiences that have the power to transform people’s lives. Experiences like that of our winning team from Resaca Middle School.Y ou can clearly see the impact of that work within the Verizon family and among our customers and the communities we serve. 
CREATING SOCIAL IMPACT 
In education, our employees 
help apply our technology to make dreams of a better tomorrow come true for so many individuals, particularly those in disadvantaged communities. And, we’re doing similar work in healthcare  
and energy. 
Our employees play a significant role 
as volunteers, rolling up their sleeves in the communities in which they live and work to benefit Verizon’s social causes and the local causes that they care deeply about.
We’re unwavering in our dedication 
to build a better, greener world,  
and are continually working to reduce our carbon footprint and use sustainable business practices.  
Plus, every day, we provide our customers with a suite of solutions to help them minimize their own environmental impact. Rose Stuckey Kirk

2014 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTAnd we constantly measure the 
results of all programs to continuously improve our solutions, and scale the most promising initiatives to make the greatest impact. 
 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE 
RESUL TS OF WHICH WE’RE ESPECIALL Y PROUD
Our education programs are 
revolutionizing classrooms across the country: 
Teachers receiving technology 
training through our Verizon Innovative Learning Schools (VILS) note spending less time lecturing and more time teaching students at the individual level.
Our teachers report that their students are more engaged in their subjects and have greater interest in math and science careers. 
For the second year, VILS students 
improved in academic achievement and showed more than a 4 percent increase in standardized math tests at the schools that have been surveyed.
We’re equally proud of our 
achievements in sustainability.
Over the past two years, we  
have invested $137 million in  green energy, including solar and fuel cell power, to run our networks and data centers — equivalent  
to 2,700 homes’ electricity for a year — eliminating 20,000 metric tons of CO
2.
Also, we introduced our customers to ways they could use wireless devices and broadband communications to manage their fleets and buildings, run power grids and telecommute. The impact in 2014 was the equivalent of taking 3 million cars off the road.
These examples show how we are 
making measurable, positive impacts in our communities and in many other areas. In the pages that follow, you’ll learn even more about the work Verizon is doing. We can’t afford to rest on our accomplishments, and by the time this report goes to print, we will already be at work striving to achieve even greater results in 2015. We’re doing this in ways that are exciting, inspiring, and which create inestimable value, not only for the world we live in — but for the world as we would want it to be.PRESIDENT’S LETTER

We have long believed that it 
is essential to minimize the environmental impacts of our operations. We’re proud to offer products that help our customers reduce their carbon footprint. Most recently, we’ve been using our technology to address social issues that can help people lead a better life: particularly in education, healthcare and energy management.From time to time, we check with 
our customers to make sure we’re tackling the issues that are most important to them. In 2014 we did this by engaging Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) to conduct a materiality assessment. BSR surveyed customers across our business in direct interviews and online surveys.The results reaffirmed that our customers care about what we  
care about.  
We’ve committed ourselves to 
responsible business practices that improve our efficiency and reduce risk to our business. We apply our innovative technology to social challenges, delivering solutions that improve people’s lives while creating new markets for our business.

EDUCATION
Lifting student achievement by 
closing the digital divide.As one of the world’s leading 
technology companies, we at Verizon are acutely aware that technology influences every aspect of our lives and its importance is growing daily. 
Over the next 10 years, the most 
robust job growth will be in fields requiring science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills.
But we’re preparing too few young 
people to play a meaningful role in an increasingly tech-based economy. Few high school seniors are ready for college-level math and science. 
For women and minorities, the gap  
is even wider. Women, who make up almost half of 
the overall workforce, hold only 24 percent of the jobs in tech or STEM fields. African-Americans  
comprised 11 percent of the total 
workforce in 2011, but only 6 percent of the STEM workforce. The Hispanic share of the workforce was 15 percent, but just 7 percent of the STEM workforce.
By current estimates, STEM 
occupations will create 2.6 million job vacancies by 2020.
Unless we make some changes, we’ll 
be hobbling the job prospects of large numbers of our citizens — and potentially putting a damper on U.S. innovation itself. BY PUTTING TECHNOLOGY IN KIDS’ 
HANDS, LIKE  AT CHUTE MIDDLE SCHOOL IN EVANSTON, ILL., WE’RE HELPING  TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.

many youths shy away.

mobile technology had the potential to play a crucial role in revolutionizing classrooms and sparking interest in STEM subjects. After all, this is technology that kids love — technology that’s unique in its ability to put the world into individual students’ hands, no matter where they live.
So we decided to bring connectivity 
and digital devices to young people, especially those who otherwise would be left on the distant side of the digital divide, and to show teachers the best ways to use the technology for learning.
Beginning in 2012, we started 
working in underserved schools OUR SOLUTION 
Seizing on kids’ love of tech to  
build interest in STEM.
across the nation: rural, urban, suburban. Concentrating on science and math classes, we recognized that if we could train teachers on how to use smartphones, tablets and technology in the classroom, we could change the way that they teach and the way students learn. We went to schools that had technology in place and helped teachers understand how to best leverage the technology to increase effectiveness, engagement and comprehension.
VILS
This is how our Verizon Innovative Learning Schools (VILS) program was born. The program provides two years of comprehensive and ongoing professional development on how to effectively integrate mobile technology into all aspects of the learning process. We partnered with the International Society for Technology Education (ISTE) to develop and deliver the training and put specific metrics in place to find out if teachers gained proficiency and confidence in how they used devices in the classroom — and most importantly, if students became more engaged in the learning process. 
We started with 12 schools in the 
2012-13 school year and added  
12 more in the 2013-14 school  
year. Our results have been consistently positive. 
In our most recent research, 
conducted in 2014, nearly every teacher surveyed (98.6 percent) reported positive outcomes in either student engagement or learning.

PREPARE FOR THE VERIZON INNOVATIVE APP 
CHALLENGE IN THEIR ENTREPRENEURSHIP CLASS AT NOVA MIDDLE SCHOOL IN DAVIE, FLA.In those first 24 VILS schools, we had 
focused on math and science courses. For our next step, we wanted to  
go bigger. 
We decided to take VILS school-wide 
to see how learning might improve if every student had access to technology for every subject. And because we knew that many students lacked access to the Internet at home, we decided to make sure the playing field was level for everyone.
ConnectEd
In the fall of 2014, we added eight new VILS middle schools in four states. This time, with the help of another nonprofit expert, Digital Promise, we provided brand-new tablets for every student, over 5,000 in all. We also set up two-year data plans to equip each student and teacher with 24/7 Internet access. 
The expansion was part of a major 
commitment we made on Feb. 3, 2014, to support ConnectEd, a White House initiative that aims to close the digital learning divide — by bringing next-generation broadband and high-speed wireless to 99 percent of American schools by 2017. We pledged up to $100 million toward the effort.
We now have 32 VILS schools in 
underserved areas for 15,838 students from coast to coast.
Mobile Learning Academy
Our professional development for teachers has proved so valuable that we wanted to offer the same opportunities to teachers everywhere. So we scaled our professional development program, using the reach that only the Internet can offer. In our Verizon Mobile Learning Academy, teachers are receiving a free, moderated, 10-week online learning program. While earning continuing-education credits from Johns Hopkins University, they’re acquiring skills using mobile technology to make learning come alive for each student.
When we announced the program, 
there was clear demand for this type of training. We launched the academy in September and soon trained 98 teachers and administrators who reach 5,262 students at 15 schools. Our goal is to train educators in 100 schools by December 2015.
App Challenge
We also wanted to arm students with the real-life skills they’ll need to succeed in the modern workplace. Skills like critical thinking, collaboration, negotiation and problem solving.

INTERNET ACCESS.We pledged up to  
$100 MILLION   
in cash toward connecting  
99% of schools by 2017We realized that we could accomplish 
this and teach STEM skills at the same time by encouraging kids to dive beneath the surfaces of the smartphones and tablets they love so well and to actually design apps for them. Through hands-on experience, the kids would see they can do much more than simply use the technology — they can create with it. 
And so we started the Verizon 
Innovative App Challenge, a contest in which we invite students in middle and high schools to develop original concepts for mobile apps. 
In forming their concepts, students 
must consider an app’s usefulness and marketability. Their app must solve a concrete problem in their school or community, be easy to use and meet marketplace needs. 
As they do all of this, students learn 
from experience that STEM subjects aren’t just academic exercises, but practical tools for improving life in today’s world.
The top ideas win Best in State and 
Best in Region awards. Ultimately, we name eight teams Best in Nation. These eight winners are awarded up to $20,000 in cash grants for their schools to support STEM programming and a Samsung tablet for each team member. 
Better yet, they get to turn 
their ideas into reality: Master trainers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab give personalized, onsite and virtual training on coding and app development, using MIT App Inventor to develop the teams’ apps.
The winning teams have developed apps such as “Snap Docs, ” which 
converts hard copy text to editable documents; “Super Science Girl, ” which encourages girls to pursue STEM careers (by offering, for example, fun experiments to perform); “HikeAbout, ” a hiker’s aid that provides trail maps, identifies 
One Best in Nation winner of the Verizon Innovative App 
Challenge, the team from Resaca Middle School in Los Fresnos, 
Texas, participated in the 2014 White House Science Fair. The six-girl squad invented a mobile app called “Hello Navi” to help a visually impaired fellow student navigate their school.

One app, “Hello Navi, ” which was built 
to help a visually impaired student navigate his middle school, went to the 2014 White House Science Fair.
In the last two years, our winning 
student teams placed 16 apps on Google Play and the App Store. The apps have been downloaded at least 22,900 times.
The students’ excitement  
is measurable: 
 n91 percent of the kids on winning 
teams said they were now more likely 
to pursue a STEM career. 
 n61 percent reported stronger 
interest in computer science.
We decided to extend the rewards 
of app development to reach more underserved and under-represented students. We enlisted the help of  
such organizations as the Network  
for Teaching Entrepreneurship,  
Project Lead the Way, Boys 
& Girls 
Clubs of America, Girls Who Code and the American Association of University Women. 
Those programs yielded the same 
great results. At the completion of the Girls Who Code summer sessions we sponsored in Miami, for instance, 88 percent of the teens said they were considering a career in technology. And 91 percent said they were likely to study computer science in college.

Our social impact programs  
are metrics-driven. In 
everything we do, we take a highly rigorous approach to measuring social impact. 
We apply a logic-based model that 
systematically captures data against short-term, mid-term and long-term goals. The results provide insights on how to replicate and scale our programs up for greater impact, or make adjustments and tweaks. We also tap into third-party partners to help us measure those results accurately and objectively.
Our 2014 goals were focused on 
expanding our mobile tech-based programs to further drive student engagement and achievement in STEM.  
Here’s what we said we’d do in 2014, 
and what we did:App Challenge 
GOAL } Select and train another 
24 regional and national winning teams in the next App Challenge. Launch afterschool app development programs for underserved students.
PROGRESS } We provided the eight 
national and 16 regional Verizon Innovative App Challenge teams  
with in-person and/or virtual training to develop their winning concepts into apps.

training course.
PROGRESS } We closed the Thinkfinity 
Community and removed all Thinkfinity Content Partner resources from the platform. After 10 years and more than $50 million invested in the platform, Thinkfinity was sunsetted.
We created a mobile learning 
professional development program: the Verizon Mobile Learning Academy. The Academy, launched in September 2014, is a virtual and moderated course that provides training to teachers and administrators on effectively implementing mobile learning in schools. Teachers receive continuing education units from Johns Hopkins University upon completing the 10-week academy.

UTeach 
GOAL } Expand the UTeach 
professional development program, which helps prospective math and science teachers learn how to integrate mobile technologies into the lessons they give to K-12 students, to an additional four universities.
PROGRESS } We launched the 
UTeach program in four additional universities for a total of eight:

The UTeach mobile curriculum will be 
available to more than 40 universities in the fall of 2015. The assignment in Marissa Born’s 
seventh grade mechanical engineering class was to make a “Rube Goldberg” machine, a comical sequence of wedges, weights and levers that would make a thumbtack pop a balloon.
The kids tried and tried. No luck.Then the kids thought of using their 
iPads to record the action in slow motion — and soon saw how to add  
the needed force. 
Pop!At the Vista Innovation & Design 
Academy (VIDA) near San Diego, all 680 students and 38 faculty members received iPads and 24/7 data plans last fall as part of the Verizon Innovative Learning Schools program. 
“The excitement and novelty of having 
an iPad has led to learning, ” said Provost Cindy Anderson.
VIDA is a new magnet school,  
started in August to replace a  
school plagued by poor attendance, 
discipline and academics.Two-thirds of VIDA ’s students —  
most from families in poverty —  
had attended the former school. 
This school year, suspensions have 
dropped by 92 percent and discipline referrals by 79 percent. School-wide, attendance has improved 8 percent. Quarterly grades are up. And internal assessments are showing marked improvements in math and reading, according to administrators.
“The connectivity — that’s the game-
changer, ” said Principal Eric Chagala. Many students lacked Internet access at home before Verizon stepped in. Now “new learning opportunities” extend beyond school hours. 
The tablets have “really gone from 
being a toy to a tool, ” said Born. 
“Now the kids can look things up  
for themselves, and I think that’s  
really powerful, ” the teacher said, 
“because it’s gone beyond asking the teacher for all the answers. It’s student-driven technology. ” With tablets in student hands, California 
school is on upswing. 15

We know that if we are to be serious about getting more 
girls into STEM, we have to change societal attitudes about girls in math and science. 
That’s why we partnered with the group MAKERS and 
produced a digital campaign called # InspireHerMind. 
The campaign was highlighted by a video showing a young girl being discouraged by her parents from pursuing her love of science. Ultimately, the spot asked viewers to encourage our daughters to aspire to be not only  “pretty, ” but “pretty brilliant, ” too. Smashing Stereotypes, Inspiring Minds.

OUR INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS 
In India, a high-tech boost for 
science education.
Our technological solutions 
are improving educational outcomes even for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children of India — where, despite rapid development,  
42 percent of the population lives on less than $1.25 a day. 
Verizon has teamed with Shanti 
Bhavan, a boarding school for children of India’s lowest caste who enter at age 4 and stay through high school. They’re the first in their families to receive a formal education.
Verizon provided science and math 
classes with new laptops, white- board technology, online remote mentoring, faster Internet broadband connectivity and additional solar panels to power the entire system. 
Now students can use the Internet 
to access educational resources, research science projects and engage with mentors.
And one day in April, 19 product-
development employees from our Bangalore office spent a day at  
the school as volunteers, visiting science, math and English classes  
and painting classrooms.
The result: a 10-point increase 
in one year on standardized test scores, jumping to an average of 80 percent from 70 percent  — the highest in the school’s history. Also in India, we teamed up with the Institute of International Education to foster STEM interest and knowledge among Indian girls. Trained facilitators and Verizon professionals worked with 200 students from 10 girls’ high schools in Hyderabad and Chennai over summer and winter vacations. 
Six of the schools began using 
technology for the first time, a

OUR MISSION: Using mobile technology to empower

 WWW .VERIZON.COM /ABOUT /RESPONSIBILITY /HEAL THCAREChronic diseases are among 
the most common, costly and preventable of all health problems. These persistent conditions are the nation’s leading causes of death and disability, and account for the majority of U.S. healthcare costs. 
Conditions such as heart disease, 
respiratory disease, obesity and diabetes have an especially devastating effect on underserved patients. 
In our society, the quality of care 
depends greatly on socioeconomic status, education level, race and ethnicity. Patients who lack access and who are slow to receive sound medical attention end up with worse outcomes for their chronic diseases.Populations with low socioeconomic levels are three times more likely to be affected by a chronic illness.
“Poor access to healthcare comes at 
both a personal and societal cost, ” says the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
“For example, if people do not receive 
vaccinations, they may become ill and spread disease to others. This increases the burden of disease for society overall in addition to the burden borne individually. ”

The age of mobile 
communications — an age that 
Verizon has done so much to bring about — opens exciting possibilities for medicine.
Doctors can send customized texts 
in real-time response to a patient’s abnormal reading. Medical specialists can instantly read X-rays and electrocardiograms from another part of the world. Health workers in an office can watch patients at home take their medications on videos taken by a smartphone and viewed over a secure network.
Through mobile devices and our cloud, 
wireless network and other services, we are putting into play innovative programs to monitor the care and improve the lives of those who are OUR SOLUTION

for patients.
suffering from or susceptible to the 
most serious chronic diseases.
Respiratory Conditions
We’re using telemedicine to manage respiratory ailments as serious as tuberculosis. In a project pioneered at the University of California at San Diego, doctors began using smartphones to monitor tuberculosis medications, a method called Video Directly Observed Therapy (VDOT). 
Patients make video recordings of 
themselves taking their medications and then send the recordings to their public health department via Verizon’s secure cloud platform. 
Our HIPAA-enabled cloud solution 
allows several health departments, 
from California to New Y ork, to download the videos and monitor patients’ TB treatments at a much faster rate, and for much less money, than by traveling to the patient’s home or workplace to observe the same thing.
We went on to develop a live-
streaming VDOT system in New Y ork City. Instead of a video download, health workers watch in real time and interact with patients via a videoconferencing mobile app.
In San Francisco, professionals at the 
Children’s Health Fund are helping teens and young adults who are homeless — or close to it — manage asthma and smoking by sending health-related text messages.  
One thing all these kids seem to  
have, no matter how tenuous their living situation: a cell phone. And they’re willing to use it to manage their health.
The messages address everything 
from the importance of adhering to medication schedules and quitting smoking to an array of other common health problems, such as diet and safe sex. To hold the kids’ attention, the texts resemble games. Get the right answer and win a movie ticket or some other prize — while learning something important about staying healthy at the same time.TELEMEDICINE PLA YS

Among the 400 young people 
who visit the Teen Health Van 
every year, about 40 percent are or were recently homeless. They come into the mobile clinic, which travels from San Francisco to San Jose, with an array of needs: education on safe sex and healthy diets, access to condoms and birth control, counseling for bullying and depression.
Dr. Seth Ammerman, who 
started the Teen Health Project in 1996, was wondering how to With text messages, health workers  
reach out to homeless young.Last year, we laid the groundwork for a project to launch in early 2015 that will help an estimated 500 poor and minority children in Boston manage their asthma. The children, their parents and school nurses will use smartphones to remotely input data to help the kids stick to an asthma action plan.
Diabetes
To help patients with or at risk of developing diabetes, we conducted two programs last year that used smartphones to communicate with patients. In a partnership with Johns Hopkins Medicine, we sent texts and educational content to obese women in hopes of increasing their activity levels and improve their conditions. With the Emory University School of Medicine, we used remote monitoring and texting to enable diabetic women to manage their disease. 
Results of the projects are scheduled 
for release in April 2015. 
Also last year, we completed the 
preliminary work for projects aimed at helping people manage obesity and diabetes in several underserved parts of the country, starting in early 2015. The patients will primarily be people of limited means who are disproportionately affected by their living conditions and often lack access to quality care.
Applying our solutions, community 
health workers will use tablets and remote monitors to track the blood sugar levels, fitness levels and other key indicators of people with diabetes in Arkansas. Others will do the same for diabetics in rural Georgia. We will  IT’S A GREAT

The pilot was so successful  
that Ammerman aims to extend  
the program to more of his

An elderly woman lives alone. 
When she gets out of bed and steps on her bedside rug, the sensors in the “smart mat” send a message across town to her daughter that Mom is up and has started her day.
A 25-year-old monitors his vitals 
with a fitness-tracking bracelet that syncs to an app on his phone. If the app notes minor trouble,  
it acts like a “virtual mother” and suggests a home remedy. For something more serious, it  
flashes the phone numbers of doctors to see.
These creative ideas popped up 
when Verizon asked Philadelphia University students to brainstorm how Verizon technology could improve the health of millennials, the elderly, and the millions of Americans whose main contact with the health system is the emergency room.
In a partnership called the  
Verizon Nexus Learning Challenge, 
students studying business, industrial design and occupational therapy worked with Verizon in spring 2014. The goal, said one Verizon executive: Create “a perfect incubator for coming  
up with new solutions to real-  
world problems. ”
The ideas may someday be 
developed into Verizon products. The first concepts were certainly promising; the program was extended for another three years.Incubating  
healthy business  
ideas at PhilaU. measure the projects by a variety 
of metrics, including the number of patients and healthcare workers recruited, weight loss, activity, technology usage, biomarker changes and diabetes education.
 Two of our programs will be aimed at 
Hispanics, whose risk of developing diabetes is 1 1
/2 times greater than 
for non-Hispanic white Americans. 
One program in Texas will manage 
patients’ diabetes through texting, telehealth sessions and the remote tracking of activity levels, dietary habits and glucose — and their progress will be compared with a group of patients who receive ordinary care. 
In Miami, the Children’s Health Fund 
will help children manage obesity through monthly telehealth visits with a dietician and other medical providers. We’ll give 50 children smartphones to connect with the program and track their diet and exercise habits.
We’ll gauge the project’s effectiveness 
by keeping tabs on such metrics as the number of providers and participants; adherence to care plans and telehealth appointments, frequency of the app’s use, percent of patients with demonstrated behavioral changes, and biomarker changes.
Heart Disease
To battle heart disease, cardiologists in Miami began using our 4G L TE network to examine children of poor families who come for free care at the Children’s Health Fund mobile health clinic, which serves a number of mostly Hispanic neighborhoods. 
Also last year, we launched a program 
to enable Cambodian seniors in California to manage their conditions and improve their health by using remote monitoring devices and telehealth sessions on tablets. 
We did the same in South Boston with 
seniors with heart disease or diabetes. And we made plans to launch a similar program for elderly minority patients in North Carolina with peripheral artery disease, a circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs.
Metrics for these programs will be 
tracked in 2015.

Eight-year-old Ivan was laying 
on an examining table while a nurse attached wires to his arms, chest and legs. A heart specialist was readying herself to read his EKG at her computer — 15 miles away.
A recent arrival from Cuba with a 
suspicious heart murmur, Ivan had been brought by his mother to the Pediatric Mobile Clinic, a converted motorcoach that travels around Miami to dispense free medical services to children and teens, and which has a particular eye out for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for Hispanics in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control. 
Verizon teamed with the Children’s Health Fund to equip the clinic 
for telecommunications and provide funds for specialists. The goal: Make sophisticated medical services available to the poor, disadvantaged and isolated.
“This is awesome, being able to 
transmit patient information by video communications, ” said Brenda Osuwu, an assistant nursing professor who was helping with Ivan’s exam. “Y ou don’t have to  
be there [in person] and still get  
a result. ”
From her office in downtown Miami, 
cardiologist Dr. Mary Sokoloski noted Ivan’s EKG readings as they appeared on her computer. She watched by video and listened over headphones as the nurse checked Ivan with a stethoscope.She liked what she heard. “OK! Sounds good, ” the cardiologist said.
Dr. Gwynn then told Ivan’s mother 
that there was nothing to worry about, Ivan’s heart was just fine.

Abigail Verduzco’s household energy 
bills used to average $120 a month. Now, as a part of the Pecan Street Inc. Project, they’re $80 or $85.
A saving of $35 or $40 means a lot, 
she says, when you have two kids and you’re living on a low to moderate income. “That $40 is a weekend with my children. That $40 is a nice dinner out. We have a big car and if we want to go with the kids somewhere, that’s a full tank of gas. ”
Her two-bedroom apartment 
has been equipped with a smart thermostat, which automatically adjusts the inside temperature when no one is home. Verduzco can read the results via a Wi-Fi router and tablet supplied by Verizon.
Now that she sees exactly where 
each energy dollar goes, she and her kids are more conscious of their energy use.Saving money by

Y ou’ll usually find Nancy 
Shoemaker at home. 
The part-time English-Spanish 
translator doesn’t get around much. The Austin grandmother lives alone with her small  
poodle, Sasha.
With severe emphysema, she’s 
reliant on an oxygen compressor. Get her off the machine, and  
she soon tires out. Next she  
feels sick. Before long, she’s in serious trouble.
On a limited income, she’s often 
wondered how much it costs her to run the oxygen compressor she can never shut off. She once asked the power company. They said they didn’t know.
But soon after she joined the 
Pecan Street Inc. program and began charting her energy use, the answer showed up plainly on her tablet: the compressor accounted for almost half of her energy bill. 
Keeping the compressor running 
took up “a lot larger percentage of my bill than I had guessed, ” Shoemaker says. 
Shoemaker won’t cut back on 
the compressor, of course; it’s too important to her health. But Pecan Street Inc. advisors showed her how to trim her electric bill in other ways. 
Now she tries harder to turn off 
unneeded lights. She cooks more with the microwave, instead of the oven. She lets food cool before putting it in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, her new smart 
thermostat has learned her daily habits and adjusts the apartment’s temperature automatically, keeping her comfortable while using less air conditioning.
She loves how the technology 
is telling her exactly where her energy dollars go. — nancy shoemaker

BLS Trucking, which runs 
245 trucks throughout the Midwest, many for  
the lumber industry, had  
a problem. 
Soaring fuel expenses, three 
stolen trucks and some baseless claims against its drivers  
were chipping away at the company’s profits. 
BLS turned to Networkfleet, 
and suddenly the company could track location, speed, idle time, fuel usage and other types of data directly from every vehicle’s engine. 
The data enabled the company to 
save on repair costs. To quickly recover a truck when it was stolen. To defend false claims by proving trucks weren’t located where damage had allegedly occurred. 
And by eliminating unauthorized 
trips and unnecessary idling time, BLS saved an estimated $188,000 in fuel costs during the first year alone. Tracking its

program, highlighting the potential of ICT to mitigate greenhouse gases. 
According to GeSI’s projections, 
ICT-based solutions can potentially reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions 16.5 percent by 2020 — a $1.9 trillion savings in gross energy and fuel, and a 9.1-gigaton reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent.
GeSI  plans to update this number 
in June 2015 with a report that will identify the carbon-reducing value ICT has delivered to date, as well as project the potential for ICT to support global carbon-reduction goals through 2030. The report will be an important tool for policymakers crafting climate change mitigating policies around the world.
We are doing our part by 
offering customers an array of telecommunication and information services to enable them to better manage their energy use.
Networkfleet
A prime example is our wireless telematics product, Networkfleet, which gives fleet managers GPS and engine-performance information on each of their cars and trucks, helping them plan more efficient routes, improve maintenance and foresee mechanical breakdowns — saving time, mileage and fuel.

Overseeing 16,400 miles 
of roadway, the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD) maintains several thousand vehicles for highway construction and maintenance, transportation, administration and law enforcement.
It’s a challenge to manage 
this massive fleet efficiently enough for the taxpayers. For help, the department turned to Networkfleet.
Tested on 12 vehicles, the system 
sent cars on smarter routes, saving gas. And AHTD found it easier “to mobilize our forces during unplanned events like snow or ice, ” said Danny Keene, division head of equipment and procurement.
Soon Networkfleet was installed 
on all 2,500 highway passenger vehicles. With the cars idling less and burning less fuel, the department saved nearly $500,000 in fuel expenses the first year.
Dispatchers were soon directing 
dump trucks, snow plows and other vehicles to emergency situations faster. And by providing precise GPS locations, Networkfleet even made it easier for police to recover stolen vehicles.

This brought Verizon’s two-year 
on-site green energy investment  
to $137 million. 
Making Our Buildings Smarter
In 2009, we began certifying Verizon retail stores in the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED program (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). LEED certification means that a building is designed, constructed and operated to ensure energy savings, emissions reductions and improved environmental quality. 
We also seek ENERGY STAR® status 
certification for all eligible retail stores, a designation made by the  
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
Most of our ENERGY STAR-certified 
stores are equipped with LED lighting, energy management systems and time-controlled heating, ventilation and air conditioning units. 
Last year, we set two goals  
for our retail stores: 
GOAL } Earn LEED certification for 
225 retail stores by the end of 2015. 
PROGRESS } By the end of 2014, 230 
of our retail stores had earned LEED certification, beating our 2015 goal by more than a year. We will continue to certify locations in 2015.
GOAL } Pursue ENERGY STAR 
certification for all eligible Verizon retail stores.GOING GREEN:

Last year, after implementing  
12.4 megawatts of solar and fuel  
cell energy in 2013 to help power 
Verizon facilities, we set a more ambitious target:
GOAL } Implement 20 megawatts  
of on-site green energy by  
year-end 2014. 
PROGRESS } We exceeded the goal. 
We installed 22 megawatts of fuel cell and solar photovoltaic systems. And at year’s end, we had another

PROGRESS } Eighty-eight retail 
stores were eligible for ENERGY 
STAR certification in 2014, and 100 percent of those stores were certified during the year, bringing our total of ENERGY STAR-certified stores to 177.
It was the second straight year that 
Verizon Wireless was named an ENERGY STAR Partner of the  
Y ear by the EPA.
Each year, the EPA honors a select 
group of organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through superior energy efficiency. In 2013 we became the first wireless company to win the award. 
And we went beyond retail stores. 
In Coatesville, Pa., where we are  
a tenant in a large distribution  
center, we teamed up with the building’s owner to complete the steps necessary to attain  
ENERGY STAR certification. 
The facility earned an impressive 
score of 81 out of 100, which  
means it uses energy more  
efficiently than 81 percent of  
similar facilities nationwide. 
It was the first building of its type to 
earn ENERGY STAR certification — an illustration of our commitment  
to lead the industry.
We’re also employing green 
strategies in our data centers.
Keeping servers cool is a significant 
cost for data centers. Verizon is rolling out a quiet containment design that minimizes the amount of energy used by the computing equipment. 
We use Vigilent Energy Management 
Systems (VEMS) to monitor and control the cooling units required to regulate data center temperature.  
By using VEMS and replacing  
parts regularly, we’re maximizing energy efficiency.
In 2014, we saved 13.2 million 
kilowatt hours at seven domestic  
and one international sites. We saved  
on electricity by installing solar panels, improving air circulation  
and installing lighting controls and LED lighting.
At one location we installed a 
chemical-free water treatment system that should reduce water

kilowatt hours saved by 
installing solar panels, improving air circulation and installing lighting controls and LED lightingVerizon’s vow to 
‘Change the World. ’
Company-wide, we pledged 
to reduce 5.2 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions through the ENERGY STAR Change the World Campaign, a national call to action for individuals and organizations to help reduce emissions, starting by switching to lighting that’s earned the ENERGY STAR label for  
energy efficiency.
At the end of 2014, about 
three-quarters of the way through the campaign, Verizon had reached 153 percent of  
the company’s goal. 
For the next round of Change 
the World, which kicks off on Earth Day, April 22, 2015, Verizon employees have pledged to reduce 8 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions.SOLAR PANELS AT

consumption by 28 percent, for 
a projected savings of 5.1 million 
gallons of water per year.
We reached a total of more than 
10,000 HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) economizers at our cell sites in 2014. Economizers reduce electricity consumption by using outside air to cool the equipment. 
These deployments cut electrical 
consumption by an estimated 68.5 million kilowatt hours and 47,300 metric tons of CO
2.
Running a More  
Efficient Fleet
One way we’re using less energy: We’re reducing the number of dispatches of our service trucks.
Our technology is giving customers 
greater control over the installation experience. We’ve provided tools  
to make it easier for them to  
perform their own installations and trouble-shoot problems on their own. And because our fiber network is more reliable than copper, our customers are experiencing  
fewer problems overall, giving customers have less reason to  
call for a service technician.
Making fewer customer calls means 
driving fewer miles. Which means we consume less fuel, and therefore release less carbon dioxide into  
the atmosphere.
When we do send vehicles out 
on the road, we’re increasingly equipping them with Networkfleet, our telematics product for fleet management. With this system, managers can keep a closer eye on engine performance, and drivers spend less time idling. Every bit helps save on fuel and, thus, emissions.
By the end of 2014, we had equipped 
28,575 vehicles in Verizon’s internal fleet equipped with Networkfleet or a similar third-party solution.
Y ear by year, we are consuming less 
gasoline. The 34.3 million gallons our vehicles consumed in 2014 was almost 25 percent less than our fuel consumption in 2010 (45.2 million).
In Battle of the 
Buildings, we take the lead in retail.
Don’t pop the corks yet, but 
midway through the EPA ’s National Building Competition — or Battle of the Buildings — Verizon was in first place in retail, and fourth place overall.
The contest, which began in 
July 2014, pits more than 5,500 competitors in a nationwide contest to see whose buildings reduce energy and cut greenhouse gas emissions the most.
  The competition 
ended December 31. 
The EPA is expected to announce the results in May 2015.CONSUMPTION

GHG EMISSIONS REPORTING STANDARDS
SOURCES OF EMISSIONS FACTORS
DATA COLLECTION AND ESTIMATIONSThe purpose of this section is to provide 
additional information regarding our carbon emissions accounting methodology. Verizon uses generally accepted accounting standards for tracking and reporting our greenhouse gas inventory. We report our emissions based on a calendar year for all sources of emissions.
We define our Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions reporting in accordance with  
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
• Scope 1 – all direct sources of emissions owned or controlled by Verizon, with the main categories being fuel to power our fleet,  to heat our buildings and to power our backup generators
• Scope 2 – indirect emissions sources generated off-site, but purchased by Verizon. The main category is electricity to power our networks and data centers, plus a small amount of steam and heat purchased to heat our buildings.
In addition, we reference the following standards:
• U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2008 Climate Leaders Greenhouse Gas Reporting Protocol: Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources, Direct Emissions from Mobile Combustion Sources and Indirect Emissions from Purchases/Sales of Electricity and Steam
• The Climate Registry 2008 General Reporting Protocol Version 1.1: Section 13.2 Calculating CH4 and N2O Emissions from Mobile Combustion
For Scope 3 emissions, we utilize The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.
• Scope 3 – Verizon reports employee business travel by air and rail
We utilize the following emissions factors:

100 percent of our energy usage data is not available for us to meet our March reporting deadline. Actual usage data is available to calculate 94 percent of our emissions profile. For the remaining 6 percent, we employ two estimation processes:  1. Electricity usage for facilities without 
actual metered reading or utility bills we estimate based on the Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol, Version 2.0, March 2013.2. For electricity and natural gas usage where 
full December data is not available, we utilize a five-year rolling average for the percent of annual emissions data that December represents. We estimate only the additional emissions not directly accounted for based on our reporting deadline.46

PACKAGING OUR 
PRODUCTS WITH THE PLANET IN MIND
Last year we said we’d do 
the following to make our packaging greener:
GOAL } Compile data on the 
environmental impact of all 
packaging for smartphones, tablets, basic phones, jetpacks, connected devices and home service devices. 
PROGRESS } We established a data-
capturing system to assess the environmental impact of packaging. We are now aggregating the data to create internal quarterly scorecards on the results. 
GOAL } Continue to report the  
use of recycled paper content or paper content from responsible sources for all Verizon-branded accessory packaging. 
PROGRESS } All Verizon-branded 
accessory packaging in 2014 used materials sourced from certified sustainably managed forests and land as certified, for example, by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC),  
or, the packaging had a minimum of30 percent recycled content.
GOAL } Reduce the environmental 
impact of packaging for prepaid mobile devices by 10 percent; label all this packaging with internationally recognized symbols to promote recycling; ensure that finishes on these packaging elements contain less than 10 percent volatile organic compounds (VOCs); include a measure of the amount of recycled or certified paper products in the packaging and inbox collateral.
PROGRESS } In 2014, we reduced the 
rigid plastic component of prepaid device packaging by at least  
33 percent, exceeding the target.  
This packaging generates at least  
16 percent less waste. 
In addition, we: 
 nCreated easy-to-open packaging 
that uses less plastic, but still 
protects the phone. 
 nAttained 100 percent compliance 
on Cellular Telephone Industries Association metrics, which include labeling packaging with internationally recognized symbols to promote recycling and ensuring that finishes on these packaging elements contain less than 10 percent VOCs. nPlaced labels on the back of

HELPING CONSUMERS 
MAKE GREEN CHOICES
We’re committed to giving 
our customers important information about the environmental aspects of  
our devices.
We said we’d do the following in 2014:
GOAL } Include ECO Specs data on  
all wireless devices sold online.
PROGRESS } We collected ECO 
Specs data for all wireless devices 
launched in 2014 and published the information on our website, VZW .com. We made it a requirement that device manufacturers provide the data.
The ECO Specs label, similar to 
an ingredients label, lists five key categories to help customers know what is in the device.  As of the end of 2014, 83 percent of wireless devices sold online had ECO Specs data, information we’ll continue to post online and in other customer touch points.
GOAL } Evaluate the entire  
wireless device portfolio for  
UL environmental certification.
PROGRESS } We evaluated the full 
portfolio and twelve devices were  
UL Environment-certified in 2014.
The designation is made by 
Underwriters Laboratory (UL), which has developed sustainability standards for mobile device design and performance.  
UL traditionally tests products 
for safety. The UL 110 standard provides manufacturers with a way to showcase environmental leadership and product stewardship.
How We Evaluate 
the Devices We Sell
There are 5 Key Factors 
that determine a device’s eco-conscious design:
   Percent of recycled  
content or FSC paper used  
in the packaging
  Percent of recycled content in 
the Verizon Wireless device
  Meets requirements for  
lack of industry-recognized hazardous toxins in the  
plastics and batteries
  Meets requirements for  
how efficiently the device  
uses energy
  Meets requirements for the recyclability of the device  
and its components
In addition to the 5 Key Factors on the label, we have partnered with Forum for the Future to have all of our manufacturers complete a 94-question assessment to ensure that the devices we sell meet our environmental standards.

CURBING E-WASTE
Rallying the public to recycle.  
We set this target:
GOAL } Collect 2 million pounds of 
e-waste by the end of 2015.
PROGRESS } We held 46 different 
events, including public Recycling 
Rallies and office supply swaps, in communities where we do business, and more than 4,200 people attended. We collected 414,364 pounds of material for recycling — the equivalent of offsetting 656.2 tons of CO
2. 
We also collected approximately  
500 phones for HopeLine and donated 182 boxes of supplies for local charities.
To date, we’ve collected 1.9 million 
pounds of e-waste. We’ve almost met the 2015 target of 2 million pounds.
Managing End-Of-Life  
for Our Equipment
We set this target a year ago:
GOAL } Recycle 90 million pounds of 
Verizon assets between 2014-2016.
PROGRESS } We recycled 42.5 million 
pounds of Verizon Wireline assets by the end of 2014 — reaching almost half the three-year goal in just one year.
As part of our recycling efforts, we 
have programs in place to carefully manage end-of-life for telecom equipment and batteries, including lead acid batteries. 
Verizon uses lead acid batteries, such 
as vehicle and generator batteries 
Teaming up  
with the NFL.
When Super Bowl XL VIII came to northern New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium in 2014, Verizon  
joined forces with the NFL  
for off-field activities to  
promote sustainability.
With NFL representatives, we  
held two recycling rallies: one  
in Fairlawn, N.J., and one in New 
Y ork City’s Duffy Square, where more than 150 participants collected more than 8,000  
pounds of e-waste. 
We also participated in Super 
Kids-Super Sharing events at Essex County College in Newark and Riverbank State Park in Harlem. These events usually encourage students to “recycle” unwanted items like books, sports equipment and school supplies for others in the community. This time, we also collected more than 1,000 cell phones for Verizon’s HopeLine program.
In addition to those phones, 
Verizon Wireless donated HopeLine grants of $10,000 to centers in Newark and Harlem that offer safe havens for families and youth escaping domestic violence. 
“We are thrilled to have partnered 
with Verizon Wireless for  
this year’s Super Kids-Super  
Sharing program, ” said  
Jack Groh, director of the  
NFL Environmental Program.

and back-up power systems for 
network facilities. Batteries are 
necessary to deliver services to  
our customers and to ensure  
network reliability. 
Verizon’s practices with regard to 
handling these batteries require responsible recycling that exceeds regulatory mandates.  
Our contracts with suppliers require 
them to send used batteries to approved recycling facilities that meet Verizon’s Environmental Health and Safety standards. 
All lead acid batteries from Verizon 
Wireless and Wireline operations in the United States are sent to approved facilities in the U.S. or Canada. These facilities are audited at least every five years.
MANAGING PAPER USE
Since 2011, Verizon has  
nearly doubled its purchases  
of recycled-content paper.  
This year, we turned  
those good practices into  
a commitment.
In 2014, we released our first-ever Paper Sourcing and Use Policy: a statement that Verizon promotes sustainable lifecycle practices regarding paper consumption in the course of business operations. 
We are committed to sourcing,  
using and disposing of paper 
resources in a responsible manner, consistent with the supporting guidelines outlined in the document. 
The entire Paper Policy  
can be found here.
Recycling the Paper We Use
In addition to carefully managing 
our paper use, we are committed to recycling paper and cardboard. In 2014, we recycled more than 50 million pounds of combined paper  
and cardboard.
Encouraging Customers  
to Go Paperless 
We encourage our customers to switch to paperless billing. 
We make it easy for Verizon 
customers to sign up — in stores, online, or through My Verizon Mobile and Customer Care. And we offer Verizon Smart Rewards that can be redeemed for merchandise and travel deals: 2,500 points for enrolling and 500 points for each month they remain on paperless billing.
In 2014, Verizon saved more than 
6,556 tons of paper through our paperless billing programs. This equates to saving more than 15,000 metric tons of CO
2 — or 143,000 trees.

GREEN TEAM TAKES 
ACTION AROUND  
THE WORLD
Last year we set a target for 
the Verizon Green Team — employees who join together to take volunteer actions to help the environment. 
And employees responded with more 
enthusiasm than we imagined.
GOAL } Enroll 15,000 employees in 
our Green Team by the end of 2014.
PROGRESS } The Green Team grew 
to 16,592 members — employees in 29 countries united in a passion for protecting the environment.
Verizon Green Team members and 
other employees participated in 130 events throughout the year, including Earth Hour, recycling events and green fairs. And more than 500 Green Team members, other employees and their families completed more than 1,800 volunteer service hours on park cleanups, neighborhood-beautification projects and restorations of natural habitats.
The Green Team’s Bike to Work 
program encouraged 733 team 
members in 19 countries to pedal to the office. By not driving to work, they saved 505,581 vehicle miles, reducing CO
2 emissions by 191.9 
metric tons.
Green Team: 
Growing 
membership, growing trees.
The Green Team acquired its 
15,000th member at mid-year. 
And to mark the milestone, employees committed to planting 5,000 more trees.
Verizon pledges to plant a tree 
for every Green Team member, in 5,000-tree increments. The first 10,000 trees were planted in India, Florida, Virginia, California and Texas in National Forests and wildlife refuges.
The next 5,000 were planted 
in the Philippines, Bass Lake, Calif., and Black Creek, Mich.  
in 2014.

More than one fifth of the participants 
— 160 team members — logged 
at least 500 miles on their bicycle commutes. And in appreciation, we gave them bike jerseys.
Green Team members did lots of 
other things as well. They held electronics-recycling events at 20 locations across the U.S. on America Recycles Day. To celebrate Earth Day, they held 27 volunteer events.  
At 13 locations in the U.S. and 
Mexico, Green Team members held office supply swaps — occasions for workers to discard unwanted office items while colleagues pick up items they can use. Every swap meant less waste for landfills while saving Verizon the expense of new supplies.
And at 145 locations, Green Team 
members participated in the Holiday Card Program, collecting more than 140,000 used cards that were sent to St. Jude’s Ranch for Children. The ranch, which serves abused, neglected and abandoned children at locations in Nevada and Texas, recycled the cards as a fundraiser. 
Green Team members were among 
the 5,295 Verizon employees in  
30 countries who participated in Earth Hour, when we darkened 547  
of our buildings around the world. 
The symbolic event, marking a 
commitment to the planet by dimming non-essential lights, was held Saturday, March 29, 2014. For an hour starting at 8:30 p.m. local time, some 30.6 million square feet of Verizon building space went dark.
Next year, we plan to support at  
least 150 green volunteering 
activities globally.
Environmental Notices 
In 2014, Verizon received 60 notices regarding compliance issues with state and local environmental regulations. Most were for record-keeping or other minor issues and did not affect the environment. All notices have been or are in the process of being resolved.505,581

We installed 18 dual stations in eight locations last year for employees to 
use. Fifty-four employees took part in the program, and completed 1,346 charging sessions. 
  The electricity they used was the equivalent of  
1,186 gallons of gasoline — sparing the atmosphere  
8,750 pounds of greenhouse gases.

A PASSION FOR STEM
As a technology company and innovation center, we rely on V-Teamers, as Verizon employees are known, with a wealth of knowledge of science, technology, engineering and math. And so STEM education is exceptionally important to us, both as a national priority and as the lifeblood for the future of our industry. 
As we’ve shown elsewhere in this 
report, we’re using our technology to help fill the STEM pipeline. Just as important, we want our people to take active roles in empowering young people with the computer skills needed to drive innovation and social change in the 21st century.
Thus we create opportunities for our 
employees to volunteer their skills to inspire the young and deepen their understanding of STEM subjects. 
Among these:
App Challenge Mentoring.  
Our information technology employees volunteer their time to help our Best in Nation winners of the Verizon Innovative App Challenge turn their proposals into working apps.

FOR THOSE IN NEED
In the award-winning, five-year-
old Verizon Pro Bono Program, attorneys and staff from our Public Policy, Law and Security group donate thousands of hours annually to help meet the demand for legal services among individual and nonprofit organizations in need.
In their pro bono work, they uphold 
the ideal of equal access to justice by The women are battered and 
abused, their pain palpable  
as they tell their stories.
“Y our heart would break, ” said Deesha 
Hill, who dutifully listens to the women’s accounts in her volunteer  
work as a Verizon lawyer.
An assistant general counsel in Verizon’s 
New Y ork City office, Hill manages a team of volunteer lawyers who process visa applications for immigrant women, usually Spanish-speaking, who are fleeing intolerable violence. 
As regional coordinator for Verizon’s 
New Y ork Legal Pro Bono Committee, Hill believes deeply that lawyers  
have an obligation to give back to  
the community. 
Besides her work with immigrant 
domestic-violence victims, she’s an enthusiastic mentor, active in programs for middle-school and high-school students, including a group called Street Law. 
“We adopt a high school in East Harlem 
and expose kids to what it’s like to be a lawyer, ” Hill said. Many of these teenagers are on track to be the first in their families to get a high school diploma. “For some, I’m the first lawyer they’ve ever met. ”
With the group Legal Outreach, she 
teams with Verizon summer interns to devise programs for seventh-graders. That’s a pivotal age for children, she says, “the year they lose interest in school or decide to continue their academic track and reach for the stars. ”
The program uses the study of law 
to spur middle-schoolers toward academics. “I really enjoy seeing the sparkle in a kid’s eye, that moment that says, ‘I got it!’” Hill said. “The next thing you know, they turn into Perry Mason. ”Pro Bono… and more: Deesha Hill

They organize and take part in scores 
of activities to promote sustainability — including Earth Hour, recycling events, green fairs, park cleanups, restorations of natural habitats and bicycling to work.
MATCHING EMPLOYEES’ 
GENEROSITY
Our V-Teamers give of 
themselves in many other  
ways as well. 
They donate time and money to 
schools and civic organizations. They help each other in times of personal crisis. They mobilize to aid communities far and near that are hit by natural disasters. 
And we back up their efforts, notably 
by making financial donations to match their gifts of time and money.For example: 
Volunteer Grants
When an employee spends 50 volunteer hours in a year with an eligible nonprofit organization or school, Verizon donates $750 to  
that organization. 
Matching Gifts to Nonprofits
When employees and eligible retirees make cash gifts to health and human services institutions, arts and cultural groups, civic and community organizations, environmental groups, or other eligible organizations...
Verizon matches  
donations dollar for dollar,  
up to $1,000 a year.
Matching Gifts to Colleges

Verizon matches employee and retiree donations up to $5,000  
a year to accredited colleges  
and universities.

It didn’t take long for Howard 
Fishman to lose himself to the local high school robotics team. His son Chandler was a freshman, signing up for the club, and Fishman figured he’d help out a little as a mentor. 
That’s all it took.
“It’s like a vacuum, ” he said. “Once 
you get into the team, you don’t want to leave. ”
More than five years — and 
hundreds of volunteer hours — later, Fishman is a fixture among the roughly 100 teens of Rocky Mountain Robotics, composed of kids from the six high schools in Colorado Springs’ northern public  
school district.
The senior software engineer 
devotes many nights and weekends to the team as it competes in the nationwide FIRST program of technology competitions.“The kids do their own robots and design, ” Fishman said. 
The adults are guides, answering 
questions, showing how to use a band saw and soldering gun. They serve as chaperones and haul the robots to meets in Denver, Kansas City, Utah — all the way to St. Louis if they make it to nationals.

Thirteen IT employees from six cities 
contributed about 200 hours to  
mentor winning teams, showing the teens how to turn a great idea for an app into reality.
Bobby Xiao is one of the busiest of the 
pack. A Verizon mobile-app developer based in Texas, he coached the sixth-grade team from Maumee Valley Country Day School in Toledo, Ohio, on the app they called Beachteria. Its purpose: Provide information on the safety of freshwater beaches in the Midwest, a timely issue after high algae levels polluted Lake Erie.
Xiao, who did his 35 to 40 hours 
of mentoring by telephone and conference calls, joined his Maumee students at the 2014 MIT App Inventor Summit in Cambridge, Mass. While there, he sat on a panel with five other Verizon employees, talking about promoting STEM through community outreach and the App Challenge.
Xiao didn’t stop there. He also began 
leading an app-building training program for underserved high school students in south Dallas. In June, the five-member training team from Verizon received the Urban League of North Central Texas’ award for “outstanding community support. ” 
Xiao came to the U.S. from his native 
China at 25. He came to Verizon upon earning a master’s degree in  
computer science from the  
University of Texas, Austin.
Today he is system architect and 
project lead for developing products for My FiOS, a mobile app that allows customers to easily access their Verizon account for TV , Internet and phone service — even turn their smartphone into a TV remote control.

worldwide workforce  THE EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCEHIGH-QUALITY 
COMMUNICATIONS SERVICESWe have work because our customers value our high-quality communications 
services. We deliver superior customer experiences through our products and our actions. Everything we do we build on a strong network, systems and process foundation. The quality and reliability of the products we deliver are paramount. Customers pay us to provide them with services that they can rely on.
We focus outward on the customer, not inward. We make it easy for customers to do business with us, by listening, anticipating and responding to their needs.  We know our 
products and can explain them to customers. We focus on fundamental execution. We are accountable and we follow through with a sense of urgency. We know that having the highest ethical standards is a competitive advantage.
FOCUS OUTWARD ON 
THE CUSTOMER
TEAMWORKWe know teamwork enables us to serve our customers better and faster. We embrace diversity and personal development not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also because it’s smart business. We are driven not by ego but by accomplishments. We keep our commitments to each other and our customers. Our word is our contract. We respect and trust one another, communicating openly, candidly and directly since any other way is unfair and a waste of time. We voice our opinion and exercise constructive dissent, and then rally around the agreed-upon action with our full support. Any one of us can deliver a view or idea to anyone else, and listen to and value another’s view regardless of title or level. Ideas live and die on their merits rather than where they were invented.
We believe integrity is at the core of who we are. It establishes the trust that is critical to the relationships we have. We are committed to doing the right thing and following sound business practices in dealing with our customers, suppliers, owners and competitors. Our competitors are not enemies; they are challengers who drive us to improve. We are good corporate citizens and share our success with the community to make the world in which we work better than it was yesterday.
INTEGRITY IS  
AT THE CORE OF  
 WHO WE ARE
BEST IS OUR 
STRENGTHWe know that bigness is not our strength; best is our strength. Bureaucracy is an enemy. We fight every day to stay “small” and keep bureaucracy out. We are more agile than companies a fraction of our size, because we act fast and take risks every day. We see crisis and change as opportunities, not threats. We run toward a crisis, not away. Change energizes us. We work hard, take action and take personal accountability for getting things done. Our actions produce measurable results.
Everything we do is built on the strong foundation of our corporate values.  
We work 24x7 because our customers depend on us 24x7. We know our best was good for today. Tomorrow we’ll do better.

technology and shifting markets so that we can lead, innovate and deliver a great experience for our customers every day.  
We’re proud to be among the best 
global corporations when it comes  
to learning and development.  
Our focus is to make learning 
immediate, engaging and convenient by delivering content wherever, whenever and however our teams need it to be best prepared to serve our customers. We leverage our own technology — mobile devices and cloud-based computing powered by our network — to deliver content in multiple formats. These include virtual instructor-led modules, self-paced online courses, gamification and VZTube instructional videos. 
We invested more than $293 million 
in learning and development in 2014, offering 23,000 courses. And V-Teamers actively utilized these resources. They completed 8.9 million hours of training — an average of 49.7 hours per team member. Over three years, our team has completed more than 24 million hours of training as part of our pursuit to be the best.
Learning Via the Portal 
At the heart of our learning-and-development platform is the Verizon Learning Portal — where, in one stop, the V Team can access a wealth of content to develop personal skills, expand technology knowledge, complete training requirements and enhance leadership capabilities.
Employees can find Skillsoft, Books 
24x7, Verizon Leadership University, VZTube videos, podcasts and much more. The portal maintains a record of all training completed and allows employees to rate and share comments about courses.
Best of all, online content is available 
24x7, making it accessible from work, home or on the go.
Assisting with Tuition 
We believe continuous learning is required to strengthen our culture and maintain our industry leadership. 
Our Global Tuition Assistance 
Program provides team members with up to $8,000 annually to fund higher-education studies for enhancing their careers at Verizon. In 2014, more than 22,000 V-Teamers used the program to continue their education and advance their career goals.
Collaborating With  
Talented People 
Learning and development in  
today’s fast-paced, technology-driven world is occurring in new and different ways.

Diabetes
With cases of diabetes on the rise, we set a specific goal last year to help V-Teamers detect and prevent the condition in 2014. 
GOAL } Implement new programs to 
help detect pre-diabetic conditions and manage the condition.
PROGRESS } We developed a diabetes 
management scorecard to capture data we can use to create programs to help V-Teamers and their families.
New initiatives in 2014 included 
home-call and mail reminders about important screenings. We also piloted a weight management program that delivers information on mobile devices to pre-diabetic participants. 
Our new diabetes management 
scorecard collects a number of metrics to send to our health care partners to improve outcomes for our employees: hemoglobin A1C screenings, medication adherence, program engagement and more.
We plan to expand our efforts in 
diabetic prevention and care in 2015.  
WellConnect
Our WellConnect portal enables V-Teamers and their families to access a variety of health and wellness resources so they can achieve their goals for living a  
healthy lifestyle. 
Information is available on preventive 
care, tobacco cessation, physical activity, nutrition, mobile tools, wearable devices and much more. The site’s My Health Vault page provides 
a personalized wellness experience. On it, more than 27,000 participants in 2014 accessed their Health Assessment score, Health Screening results and Lifestyle Incentive Tracker.

team members.
Because we believe that health 
and wellness are fundamental to success in business and in life, we continuously engage our V Team as part of cultivating a healthy workplace culture.
We will continue to work with our strategic partners internally and 
externally to improve the wellness of our population, their families and the communities where we work and live.  
Balancing Work and Life
Life is busy. 
We get it. It’s our technology that 
fuels the digital connections worldwide that are driving mobility, the Internet of Things and the endless stream of new apps that can make  
our lives feel easier and harder at  
the same time. 
So we understand the need for 
balance between the demands of work and life. That’s why we offer alternative work arrangements, along with a generous paid time off package consisting of holidays, vacation and other provided time off. 
We strive to ensure that our V Team 
members have the flexibility they need to tend to life, whether it’s celebrating good times, making that dance recital or baseball game, or taking time to care for themselves  
or family.
Today, more than 5,000 V-Teamers 
are regularly leveraging alternative work programs such as Flex-Time, Compressed Workweek and Telework, so they can get work  
and life done effectively.

most are eligible for a reimbursement of up to $10,000 for each adopted child for expenses such as legal  
fees and travel.
Employee Assistance 
All of us at times face life challenges with issues related to health and wellness, caring for children or adults, or personal issues that could affect our ability to work. 
That’s why we offer a comprehensive 
Employee Assistance Program. This valuable resource helps thousands on the V Team every year, providing information and connecting them with professional assistance spanning child services, elder care services, adoption assistance, mental health problems, financial challenges, drug/alcohol abuse, in-care social support, stress management and many other family services.
Another program that benefits 
our team members is the Verizon Employee Discount Program. V-Teamers can take advantage of discounts on many Verizon products and services, as well as those from various businesses, for automobiles, electronics, financial services,  
health/wellness, travel and  
other services.

HONORING MILITARY 
SERVICE AND STRENGTHENING OUR BUSINESS
Service members are very 
special. We honor their service to our country and actively recruit them to join our team. We value their unique skills as proven leaders who are mission-driven and effective team players. 
When military personnel join the V 
Team, they join a winning team, one where they and their families benefit from our highly decorated programs that are designed to ensure a smooth transition to the civilian workforce, so they can be successful in their  
next mission in life.     
Hiring Our Heroes
For us, it’s more than simply saying, “Thank you for your service. ” It’s about our commitment to supporting our military communities. It’s about strengthening our team and our performance-driven culture through the values veterans bring  
to Verizon.
Our outreach starts with our  
Military Recruitment Team (MRT), 
which represents each major branch of service. MRT members do much more than recruit. They also provide career coaching to service members and military spouses looking to  
join Verizon.

Another newly created feature to 
improve our ability to hire service members is our Military Talent Network. Here, service members can create profiles in our applicant tracking system that enables recruiters to perform targeted searches and send out hiring alerts.  
In 2014, we also teamed up with 
LinkedIn to tell a compelling story about the effectiveness of networking and how veterans can use LinkedIn to connect with recruiters. Prominently featured on Veterans.linkedin.com, the story received more than 375,000 views within the first month.
We are also reaching military 
personnel through such partnerships as those with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce/Hiring Our Heroes (Chairman’s Circle), the Chairman’s Office of Reintegration (CORe), Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, Joining Forces (a White House Initiative), Military Spouse Employer Partnerships, transitioning offices (Soldier for Life, Marine for Life), and military installations.
Supporting Active Duty
We understand the importance of responding rapidly and lending full support when duty calls. After all, our business requires it. As our Credo says, “We run to a crisis, not away. ” That’s why we’ve been there for more than 2,000 V-Teamers who’ve been called up to active duty during the past decade, providing benefits and protecting their employment.
Our military leave policy allows our 
service men and women to continue serving their country, and surpasses the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) requirements. When V-Teamers are called up to active duty, we bridge the gap between military pay and Verizon pay to ensure that family members are cared for, and their financial needs met. 
Our Veterans Advisory Board is an 
Employee Resource Group (ERG) 
comprising more than 400 veterans who provide recognition, mentoring and development for service member employees from date of hire throughout their employment at Verizon.
We understand that some men and

Diversity does not occur by accident 
or luck, but by belief, commitment and design. Our record — bedecked with awards and honors — proves we’re on the right track.
We measure our progress. We hold 
our executives accountable for promoting diversity within their organizations. We commit ourselves to supplier diversity by setting targets that result in billions of dollars spent with diverse businesses.

We deeply believe that we 
win as a business through our people and culture. 
Our people are proud to work 
at Verizon. They can voice their thoughts, collaborate with a community of talented and driven teammates, and bring their ideas and unique talents to the table. 
As our Verizon Credo says: “We 
voice our opinion… any one of us can deliver a view or idea to anyone else… ideas live and die on their merits rather than where they were invented... we are driven not by ego but by accomplishments. ” 
Amplifying the  
Voice of the Employee
Every two years, we give voice to the V Team and amplify it through our Verizon Viewpoints employee opinion survey. All V-Teamers are invited to participate.
A year ago, we said we would follow 
the tradition in 2014: 
GOAL } Conduct our biennial 
Viewpoints employee opinion survey in 2014 and a 2014 Performance Pulse Survey.
PROGRESS } Nearly 108,000  
V-Teamers completed Viewpoints in 2014 and customized reports were delivered to hundreds of organizations across Verizon so they can continue the dialogue with their teams and act on the results in 2015 to make our business better. Also, we conducted the Performance Pulse Survey.  
V -TEAMERS CAN  
VOICE THEIR THOUGHTS 
AND BRING THEIR IDEAS  
TO THE TABLE.
 IDEAS LIVE AND 
DIE ON THEIR MERITS 
RATHER THAN WHERE THEY WERE INVENTED... WE ARE DRIVEN NOT BY EGO BUT BY ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

2014 VERIZON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SUPPLEMENTThe Viewpoints survey drew our 
highest participation ever. 
In the survey, we asked our team 
to rate us on more than 40 items grouped under the core themes of Customer Focus, Business Priorities, V Team Culture and Employee Experience. 
We also asked them to share their 
best and worst Verizon customer experiences, and their ideas for how we can improve. Invited to share their thoughts on  
any business-related topic, the  
V Team responded with more than 73,000 comments.
We benchmark our results to ensure 
we create a world-class work experience for the V Team. Our 2014 survey showed that we surpassed industry benchmarks for measures on culture and core values, pay and benefits, corporate citizenship, overall satisfaction and engagement. And on questions repeated from the 2012 survey, favorability scores were up. 
To act on the results, hundreds of 
organizations across Verizon received customized reports and will continue the dialogue locally with their teams about how to improve both the customer and employee experiences.  
In addition to Viewpoints, we conduct 
an annual Performance Pulse survey. These surveys ensure that our leaders provide their teams with performance reviews and discussions, as well as clear performance objectives and development plans. They’re essential to how we measure the internal health and climate of the organization. 
Creating Powerful Answers 
Through Employee Ideas
Ideas wanted! 
V Team ideas are encouraged, sought 
after and appreciated. Finding those special ideas — the powerful ones that lead to innovations that can change the world — requires more than your typical suggestion box. At Verizon, we call the process Powerful Answers, the employee idea engine. 
We know that listening to the V Team 
isn’t just a “nice to do” but a “have to do. ” Ideas generated by our team members give employees a voice in moving our business forward. They set the tone for continual innovation in an ever-changing world. 
On the Powerful Answers platform, 
employees can submit ideas that are then posted for review by their teammates, who can vote, comment and collaborate. The Powerful Ideas team reviews each idea, too. Ideas with merit get supported with developmental resources. 
Since we launched Powerful Answers 
in October 2013, V-Teamers have responded in a big way, submitting an average of more than 35 ideas a day, collaborating 550,000 times, and participating in almost 50 leadership-led business challenge sessions. 
Through the Powerful Answers 
platform, we have implemented nearly 215 ideas from employees, generating  more than $13.2 million in financial benefits to the company.VERIZON VIEWPOINTS

We provide the V Team with an 
array of communications channels at all levels of the organization and across the globe. These platforms serve to educate, engage and enable our teams so they can connect, collaborate and create. 
Dialogue is central to the Verizon 
employee experience, so we encourage our people to join the conversation. And our people do provide feedback —open, candid  
and direct. They make themselves heard, whether by comments  
posted on stories, suggestions submitted on feedback tabs on our intranet, or ratings and course assessments on our learning and development portals. 
Company and industry news, work 
tools and collaboration resources help create an ongoing dialogue. Each month, most of our employees visit VZWeb, our rich, customizable company intranet available on all desktops and mobile devices. Connecting with teammates and accessing key information has  
never been easier.   On VZWeb, employees find 
such content and resources as: 
nnInternal news, covering everything 
from organizational changes 
and business updates to product launches, employee recognition and stories of employee heroism. In 2014, over 1,000 news articles were published for our V Team.  Employees commented or “liked” their colleagues’ feedback or articles more than 155,000 times. 
nn“About Y ou, ” our human resources 
website that provides a robust, personalized experience for employees. On it, they can manage their wealth accumulation; access personalized health, wellness and benefits information; review HR guidelines, safety and policy information; explore career and learning opportunities, and access performance and recognition tools.
nn“The Learning Portal, ” resources to 
help employees develop their skills, expand their knowledge, complete training requirements and enhance their leadership capabilities.

nnSocial collaboration tools such 
as our Jive-powered CrowdAround platform and Chatter, which promote knowledge and idea sharing and cross-collaboration among teams.
nnLive chat technology, where 
employees interact with leaders by asking them questions and receiving real-time answers. In 2014, live chat topics included HR strategies, supply chain, finance transformation, reducing customer churn and improving customer experiences.

speaking directly on key objectives, strategy and financial results and addressing current events and future plans. Leaders facilitate conversations, taking questions from a live audience and employees around the world, who submit questions through VZWeb or via text message. Often, employees are recognized for their contributions to the business and our customers and for modeling a work ethic aligned to our Verizon Credo. In 2014, we aired more than 80 webcasts. 
Outside of VZWeb, conversations 
continue across the globe, with smaller, more informal town hall meetings and roundtables held by senior leaders.
The voice of the employee is critical 
to our delivery of high-quality communication services, superior customer experiences and value for our shareholders. We continue to look for new opportunities to connect our employees and provide meaningful platforms for communication and collaboration.  
WORKING WITH  
LABOR UNIONS
We have a long history 
of working with the Communications Workers of America  and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — the two main unions that represent about 47,700  
of our employees.We meet with national and local 
union leaders to talk about key business topics, including issues such as safety, customer service, plans to improve operational processes, good attendance, our business performance and the impacts that changing technology and competition are having on Verizon. 
In 2014, we completed eight 
contract negotiations that cover approximately 2,900 team members. These agreements continue Verizon’s history of providing good jobs with competitive wages and valuable benefits that rate among the best in our industry. 
CREATING A CUL TURE  
OF SAFETY 
We believe safety is core to the 
employee experience. 
Our V-Teamers deserve a safe and 
productive work environment so  
they can innovate, collaborate and deliver a great experience for our customers — whether working in a call center, research lab, garage work center, store or office building, or on the road in our fleet or at a customer’s location.
In 2014, we doubled down on our 
already comprehensive safety program by launching our “2014 Y ear of Safety” training initiatives. 
We refreshed the content of 44 of the 
courses in the Outside Plant curriculum, and we made 66 safety courses mobile-ready for viewing on tablets for easy anytime-anywhere access.

important, we want the V Team to be safe at other times, too. We provide safety information that applies at home, at work and on the road on topics such as electrical safety, ergonomics, driving, and the avoidance of slips, trips and falls.  
 We continued our online “Driver 
Safety Series” training to promote defensive driving. The series is required for employees who drive on the job, but all  
V-Teamers are encouraged to participate and share it with their families. 
The defensive driving series is a 
great example of how we work to turn safety practices into daily habits at work and at home to keep the V Team safe. clear benefits to the company.  
In 2014, our Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Rate for U.S. operations was 1.28 per 100 employees —  better than 2013. That’s almost one-third better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics telecommunications industry average of 2.10.
Our safety management 
approach embraces these  
key elements:

Running our business with the

OUR MISSION: To ensure that the principles of integrity 
that are embedded in our Credo are infused into  
all of our business practices.Company reputation is very 
important as we compete in a 
global market. We understand that. It’s why we place great value on running our business with integrity and the highest of ethical standards. 
We all know this takes hard work, 
continuous commitment and a strong ETHICS AND 
COMPLIANCE
Our commitment to operate 
a responsible and ethical business starts with integrity. 
We live up to that ideal through a 
comprehensive ethics and compliance program that’s built on our Verizon Code of Conduct. The program provides ongoing educational communications, mandatory training requirements and readily accessible tools. All employees are encouraged to raise questions, report concerns and acquire information about ethics issues, policies, procedures and applicable laws.
Our employees can take advantage of 
a global set of resources to help fulfill that commitment, including:
nnThe VZ Compliance Guideline, 
which is available 24 hours a day operational plan. But that’s table stakes. A business needs to go further. 
We believe that ethics must be coded 
into your company DNA so that it becomes part of your culture and defines who you are and how you work. 
That’s where the Verizon Credo  
comes in. Our Credo sets the 
expectation for every employee: 
  WE BELIEVE INTEGRITY IS AT THE CORE OF 
WHO WE ARE. It establishes the trust that is critical 
to the relationships we have. We are committed 
to do the right thing and follow sound business practices in dealing with our customers, suppliers, owners and competitors.

We back that up by providing 
employees with training and communications that explain their obligation to safeguard confidential and sensitive information. We go beyond spelling out the company policies and legal requirements. We emphasize that protecting privacy is crucial to earning and maintaining our customers’ trust. We have a zero tolerance policy  
for unethical business practices.  
This includes bribery or corruption  
of any type. 
Relevant employees receive 
anti-corruption training and communications that clearly articulate this core principle. Our training, illustrated by practical examples, helps employees understand and comply with various anti-bribery laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We instruct employees to seek legal approval before giving anything of value to a public official. 
For teams in high-risk areas, we 
supplement this general training with targeted communications and in-person training.

AND TRAINING
To ensure we operate with 
integrity and the highest of ethical standards, we require all employees to adhere to the Verizon Code of Conduct. 
Our Code provides a comprehensive 
set of guidelines on such matters as gifts and entertainment, protecting company property and information, conflicts of interest and confidentiality — with strong emphasis on protecting the information that our customers, business partners and employees entrust to our care.
We continuously review our Code 
to guarantee that our guidelines address emerging issues and reflect the realities of what’s happening  in the marketplace wherever  
we operate.
Because it’s important that all of our 
employees understand the Code and the obligation to follow its guidelines, we require all employees to complete current Code training. Our 2015 plan calls for all employees to take mandatory training on our updated Code of Conduct.
Relationships with our suppliers are 
based on the highest standards of ethical conduct, and our Supplier  
Code of Conduct outlines what we expect from our vendors.
We administer the Conflict of 
Interest Questionnaire (COIQ) to our leadership team and our Supply Chain Services organization. The questionnaire addresses all identified actual or potential business conflicts and is completed by our entire leadership team to ensure we conduct business with integrity.

Our commitment to promoting 
human rights values is consistent with our dedication to respecting employees, valuing customers, strengthening communities, protecting the environment and engaging with stakeholders to make the right decisions for the future of our business.We’re also mindful that, because of our scope and scale, our voice can be helpful on a range of social issues that are important to our stakeholders. We are constantly looking for these opportunities. Over the past few years, Verizon has publicly advocated on immigration reform legislation, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, phone reform in prison and gay marriage.

We advocate public policies 
that benefit our customers and our employees and that enable us to compete fairly and freely in the marketplace. We post our political contributions for public view.

PRIVACY
All Verizon employees, partners 
and suppliers play a role in protecting the privacy of our customers’ information. 
We understand that consumers 
will use the full capabilities of our networks — and take advantage of the vast opportunities our products and services provide — only if they trust that their information will remain private.Our Privacy Approach
 nPrivacy is an essential element 
in the processes we use to create innovative products and services. As we develop new products and services, deploy new technologies and develop new uses of information, we examine relevant privacy questions. And we review and update our privacy policy when needed to explain additions or changes.
 n We are transparent in describing 
to our customers how their information is used, and we give customers the opportunity to choose whether certain information uses and sharing are acceptable to them. We strive to present our practices in a way that makes our privacy policy and notices easy to read.
 n We respect the choices our 
customers make about whether they are comfortable with certain uses of information because we recognize that individual customers have different privacy preferences.
 n Protecting the privacy of 
customer information is part of each Verizon employee’s responsibility, and we have safeguards in place  to shield customer information from unauthorized access, use  or disclosure.
Transparency Report
In January 2014, we became the first telecom company to issue a Transparency Report, and we issued an updated report in July 2014. Those reports share data on the number of law-enforcement requests for consumer information that Verizon receives in the U.S. and other countries where we do business.  
We will continue to update this  
report twice a year.  
While we have a legal obligation 
to provide customer information to law enforcement in response to lawful demands, we take seriously our duty to provide such information only when authorized by law. Our dedicated teams carefully review each demand and reject those that fail to comply with the law. If a demand is overly broad or vague, we will not disclose any information in response or will work to narrow the scope of the information we produce. Some

simply do not have, or where we have some, but not all, of the information sought; accordingly, we will produce no information at all or only some of the information sought by those demands from law enforcement.
Although Verizon and other  
companies provide Transparency 
Reports, these reports provide an incomplete picture of government action, given the vast number of telecommunications and Internet companies around the world that are not publicly reporting this information. The only truly comprehensive and uniform data set is in the hands of  
the governments themselves. We  
have called on all governments  
to make public the number of  
demands they make for customer  
data from telecommunications and Internet companies.
In June 2014, we were the first 
telecom company to file an amicus brief in federal district court challenging a judge’s decision to allow the U.S. government to use a search warrant to obtain customer data from Microsoft, even though that data was stored overseas. In December, with the case in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, we filed another brief along with a number of other companies. 
We have noted in our Transparency 
Report that we have not received, and do not expect to receive, any demands for customers’ data stored in our data centers outside the U.S., but we wanted to make our voice heard on behalf of our customers. 
Stakeholders for our Transparency 
Report include any member of the public. Some advocacy groups with a strong interest in such reporting have been overwhelmingly favorable:
 nThe Electronic Frontier 
Foundation’s 2014 “Who Has Y our Back?” survey awarded Verizon four stars, up from no stars in the previous year, in large part because Verizon published its Transparency Report for the first time. 
 nKevin Bankston, director of the 
New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute, examined a number of Transparency Reports and concluded that Google and Verizon tie for first place in terms of overall best practices.

GOAL } Work with Congressional leaders to improve the ability of 
healthcare providers to share data. Introduce specific dates for this interoperability into pending legislation.
PROGRESS } Verizon is a founding member of the Health IT Now Coalition,

we are committed to offering safe and accessible products that they’ll find easy to use — and that make their lives easier. 
To guide us in these efforts, we

GOAL } Introduce a suite of applications 
for the Android platform designed for seniors and people with disabilities.   
PROGRESS } In an exclusive business 
partnership, we introduced VelaSense  
in February 2015. This suite of applications has the potential to be life-changing for people who have mild difficulty seeing, or full blindness.
Using the smartphone camera and 
responsive to voice commands, VelaSense uses state-of-the-art image processing to discern text in real-life situations. It recognizes faces, money and objects whose images are stored in the device’s database or in the Verizon cloud. It can navigate around obstacles or direct the user to street addresses.

Responsible driving is 
everyone’s responsibility. We want people to arrive at their destinations safely.
In 2000, Verizon became the first 
wireless carrier to support state legislation banning hand-held cell phone use while driving. 
We’re still engaged in responsible 
driving initiatives, advocating for common-sense legislation and spearheading consumer education efforts to raise awareness about driving responsibly.
Last year, for example, we partnered 
with the Seattle Seahawks and public high schools in a campaign — “Save It Seattle: Pledge to Stop Texting and Driving” — enlisting students to pledge to stop texting while driving. Similarly in Greenville, S.C., we teamed with minor league baseball’s Greenville Drive to encourage teenagers to sign pledges not to  
text and drive. 
And in Florida, we joined the statewide 
“Put It Down” campaign of the  
Florida Department of Transportation. Among other contributions, we  
sent messages to thousands of customers and employees urging  
that they pay attention to the road, not their phones.

BRINGING L TE TO RURAL 
AMERICA
In 2010, Verizon created the 
L TE in Rural America (LRA) program, a collaborative partnership with rural  
carriers to accelerate the deployment of rural wireless broadband services.
Under LRA, participants lease 
valuable 700 MHz radio spectrum from Verizon and build their own networks, enabling them to offer 4G L TE services more quickly and economically than might otherwise be possible. A dedicated team of Verizon technology experts works directly with the rural carriers as they develop and deploy their networks.
The program is successful  
and growing.As of December 2014, there  
were 21 participants, including 
existing code division multiple  
access (CDMA) carriers and rural telephone companies. Eighteen rural mobile carriers have launched their 4G L TE wireless broadband networks, building a network of nearly 800 active cell sites that covers an area larger than the state of Utah.
The leases for the 21 participants 
cover nearly 2.9 million people in  
15 states, and represent a land  
area larger than California and Georgia combined.
Customers of the LRA carriers and 
Verizon can roam on each other’s  
4G L TE networks.
RADIO FREQUENCY 
EMISSIONS
Verizon is committed to 
providing our customers with information concerning potential health effects of radio-frequency (RF) emissions  
from cell phones.
This information may include ways in 
which to access scientific research and FCC regulations. For those concerned about possible health effects, we provide information  
on steps for reducing exposure to RF emissions.
Verizon makes this information 
available in a number of places: on our website, in a stand-alone brochure provided in the box of every new or refurbished cell phone, in the Getting Started Guide provided with every new cell phone, and in all Verizon retail stores, where a sign is posted advising that such information is available on request.

OUR MISSION: Partnering with our suppliers to meet high 
ethical, social and environmental supply chain standards.
 WWW .VERIZON.COM/ABOUT/RESPONSIBILITYSUPPLIER  
CODE OF CONDUCT
We strive to promote 
mutually beneficial business relationships with our suppliers — relationships based on the high ethical standards of our 
Supplier Code of Conduct . 
As the code explains, we expect  
our suppliers to, among other things, 
act with integrity in all respects,  
meet all applicable health, safety  
and environmental laws, and  
carefully protect confidential and proprietary information. The code also: 
nnExplicitly prohibits the use of child 
labor, forced labor and discrimination. 
nnExplicitly protects the freedom of 
association and the right to collective bargaining, pursuant to local laws. 
nnRequires suppliers to ensure 
products provided to Verizon contain no conflict minerals.
nnOutlines our intent to 
constructively engage with suppliers on compliance and enforcement.
SUPPLIER  
REVIEW PROCESS 
Verizon is committed to 
collaborating with our supply chain partners to meet the standards embodied in our Supplier Code of Conduct and applicable laws. 
To gauge our suppliers’ corporate 
responsibility (CR) compliance, we engaged EcoVadis to help evaluate key suppliers’ performance, focusing on environment, labor and human rights, fair labor practices and sustainable procurement. Verizon  
has assessed 220 suppliers since  
July 2013 through the EcoVadis  
online platform.
Suppliers fill out questionnaires.  
EcoVadis validates their responses, collects information from NGOs, media and other public sources,  
and benchmarks suppliers on various CR factors. When weaknesses are identified, Verizon is able to collaborate with the supplier on corrective action plans that promote communication and improvement.  
The result: less risk for both Verizon and the supplier.

With audits and assessments, 
we monitor and promote ethical 
conduct in our suppliers.WE PRIDE 
OURSEL VES ON OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS.In addition, we are a member of the 
Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC), an association of telecom operators that promotes shared and coordinated on-site CR audits of suppliers. 
Verizon joined the group in 2013 as 
the first U.S.-based member.  
Other members include Deutsche Telecom, Orange, Telecom Italia, Belgacom, KPN, Swisscom, Telenor, TeliaSonera and Vodafone. We serve on JAC’s Leadership Assembly and the Operational Board. 
And to ensure that our suppliers 
meet our environmental standards, we conduct an annual Supplier Sustainability Assessment. We evaluate our suppliers’ sustainability strategy, greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste management, water use and management, packaging practices and sustainability in contracting. We’ve been making these assessments since 2011. 
 
CONFLICT MINERALS
As we state in our Supplier 
Code of Conduct, we are committed to ensuring that suppliers responsibly manufacture our products. 
Suppliers are expected to ensure 
that products supplied to Verizon do not contain metals derived from tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold or their derivatives that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (or any adjoining country). 
nnOur complete Statement on 
Conflict Minerals is available online. SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
At Verizon, supplier diversity is 
a business imperative because we know that having suppliers from a variety of backgrounds helps us build long-term value for our customers. 
We know that supplier diversity 
is a fundamental requirement for business success, and we appreciate how critical our business is to the success of our suppliers. 
We continuously work to expand 
our inclusion and diversity efforts and monitor our progress. We have a robust Tier 2 program that encourages collaboration between our prime and diverse suppliers. Recognized by external organizations like DiversityInc as best in class, the program helps Verizon broaden its reach for diverse suppliers and encourages prime suppliers to use diverse suppliers in their businesses.
