 2 Stockholm 7 April, 2004  
 
 
Dear Reader,  
 
The incredibly positive reception of our CSR -report last year makes it very inspiring to introduce the report for 2003. In fact, we won a citation from FAR, the 
Swedish professional  institute for authorised public accountants, for our 2002 CSR report.  
 
The work with the report, which has been produced entirely in -house, makes an important contribution to improving our CSR -performance. Shortcomings and 
areas in need of improvement ar e clearly highlighted. Areas of success are an inspiration to keep up the good work.  
 
It is our intention that this report should be interesting reading to all our stakeholders. We keep the language easy and explain difficult expressions in a 
glossary. In  the feedback from our readers, we know that the report is read, not only by ethical investors, students and consultants, but by employees, 
customers and others. It is therefore also important to explain the processes as much as the performance. Our reader s clearly want a reply to the question 
“how?”.  
 
I specially want to comment on a few findings in the report. First, this year we have broadened our CSR -reporting to also include areas such as marketing and 
security. In Sweden more than anywhere else, we d o get comments on our advertising, and it is important to us to explain our policy in this field.  
 
H&M has not organised any special stakeholder dialogue event during the year. However, we do feel that we have a close and constructive dialogue with 
many st akeholder groups through various meetings. In this report we have made an attempt to explain the nature of this informal and continuously ongoing 
dialogue, particularly with NGOs and Trade Unions.  
 
Finally, a word on CO2 emissions. In preparing this report , we have identified unintentional errors in previous year’s reporting. In the interest of transparency, 
we try to explain the full reasons behind those errors, and have decided to change the base year to 2003 for better comparison with future years.  
 
We hope that you will find our CSR - report interesting reading, and we welcome all feedback. Please let us know how we can make our next report even 
more relevant to you!  
 
Sincerely Yours,

STATEMENT FROM OUR M ANAGING DIRECTOR  
 
 
Our clothes must  always be manufactured and sold under good working conditions. As an international corporation, we have 
a great responsibility to the world around us. Here our aims are clear. H&M intends to live up to the high ethical standards 
that can be placed on our business operation and on us as an employer and partner. We will both be and be perceived to be 
a good company and a good member of society.  
 
Taking responsibility for how people and the environment are affected by our activities is well in line with our fundamental 
values. CSR, or Corporate Social Responsibility, is therefore an important strategic issue for H&M and the department that is 
responsible for social responsibility and the environment reports directly to me. The key to all this is cooperation a nd dialogue 
– not only between our suppliers and us, but also with fellow -members of our industry, UN organisations and trade unions.  
 
H&M also supports the UN Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines For Multinational Enterprises. In so doing we want to 
signify that we respect human rights and are prepared to contribute to sustainable development within the areas that we are 
able to influence.  
 
By publishing this report, we genuinely want to demonstrate to our stakeholders our commitment to CSR as well as o ur 
successes and shortcomings within this field.  
 
 
 
Rolf Eriksen   5 CSR VISION AND STRAT EGY 
 
CSR Vision  
To uphold Human Rights, contribute to Sustainable Development and 
thereby earn trust from our Stakeholders  
 
CSR Strategy  
H&M’s general strat egy is to continue to grow whilst maintaining good 
profitability. H&M believes that good relations with the world around and 
long-term profitability depend on H&M taking responsibility for how people 
and the environment are affected by our activities.  
 
The following quote from our environmental policy very well concludes the 
general strategy that H&M has on Corporate Social Responsibility:  
 
“Continuous improvements are significant for all H&M activities. This 
includes our environmental and social efforts, which are conducted within 
the framework of our business operations. H&M's business concept is to 
give our customers unsurpassed value by offering fashion and quality at 
the best price. Our quality concept is based on ensuring that our 
customers are satisf ied with our products and H&M as a company. To this 
end, we are committed to acting responsibly in our community. We shall 
also co -operate with our suppliers to improve the social and environmental 
standards in the factories that manufacture H&M clothing, thereby 
contributing to sustainable development in these areas.”  
 CSR as defined by H&M   
H&M has chosen to define CSR as “a concept 
whereby companies integrate social and 
environmental concern in their business 
operations and in their interaction with their 
stakeholders  on a voluntary basis in order to 
meet or exceed the ethical, legal, commercial 
and public expectations that society has of 
business”.  
  6 MAIN RESPONSIBILITY ASPECTS  
 
H&M has identified a number of responsibility aspects in the area of CSR. 
These aspects are what we consider the most pressing aspects within our 
industry, part icularly focusing on our supply chain.  
 
SOCIAL ASPECTS  
 
Working conditions, Labour standards and Human Rights in 
our supply chain  
H&M does not own or operate any factories of our own. We are doing 
business with approximately 750 suppliers, who in turn use 
subcontractors. 2911 production units1 around the world manufacture our 
goods. More than half of these production units are located in countries 
where there is a risk of non -compliance with local labour laws and 
universally accepted human rights and labour  standards.  
 
Our risk assessments as well as several years of experience of monitoring 
of garment factories has shown that the main responsibility aspects are 
violation of laws concerning working hours and wages. Other pressing 
issues although less common are child labour, forced overtime, physical 
and verbal abuse, sexual harassment and unacceptable punishments. 
Unclear employment conditions, lack of employment contract, abuse of 
trainee status and exploitation of migrant workers are also not uncommon.  
 
Identification of these violations has been the first step towards 
remediation. In our Code of Conduct we make it very clear to our suppliers 
that none of the above is acceptable to H&M.  
 
                                 1 This term is used to describe factories p roducing clothes for H&M, 
whether it is a supplier’s factory or a subcontractor’s factory.  
 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALT H, AND 
SAFETY ASPECTS  
 
Product quality and safety  
Anyone who uses, works with, or in any other way comes in contact with 
our products must feel absolutely sure that there is no risk of being 
exposed to, for example, hazardous chemicals, sharp objects or easily 
flammable fabrics. There are extra safety req uirements for baby and 
children's products.  
 
Restricted Substances in our products  
All our suppliers of goods have signed an agreement to abide by 
established chemical restrictions. In this way, we contribute to the 
reduction of environmental harm through out the production of our goods 
as well as during the burning and recycling of worn out clothing. Due to 
continuously increased awareness about the negative effects of various 
substances, our chemical restrictions are regularly updated. Our 
restrictions co ncern chemicals used in the production of clothing as well as 
cosmetics.  
 
The environmental impact in the supply chain  
The most substantial environmental effects occur in the dying and 
processing of fibres and fabrics. Examples of aspects in the garment 
production are energy consumption, water pollution, and chemical 
handling. H&M’s Code of Conduct includes requirements on the 
environment.  
 
Transportation - environmental considerations  
Transportation of H&M goods, stands for approximately 46% of total 
carbon dioxide emissions caused by H&M operations. Therefore, it is vital 
for H&M, in cooperation with our transporters and service providers, to try 
to achieve more environmentally friendly transports.  
  7 H&M IN BRIEF  
 
n H&M was established in Sweden in 1947.  
n Today H&M sells clothes and cosmetics in 945 stores in 19 
countries. We plan to open 140 new stores and plan to close 13 
stores in 2004.  
n The business concept is “Fashion and quality at the best price”.  
n H&M has around 100 designers who work with a team made up of 
50 pattern designers, 100 buyers and a number of budget 
controllers to create H&M’s clothing collections for women, men, 
children  and teenagers.  
n H&M also sells cosmetics under its own brand.  
n H&M sells over 500 million items a year and new goods are 
delivered to our stores every day.  
n In Scandinavia H&M Rowells sells fashion by mail order.  
n In Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland H&M se lls fashion via 
the Internet.  
n H&M does not have any factories of its own, but instead works with 
around 750 suppliers. Around half of production takes place in 
Europe and the rest mainly in Asia.  
n H&M has 21 production offices around the world – ten in Eur ope, 
ten in Asia and one in Africa.  
n The group has around 40,000 employees.  
n The turnover in 2003 was 56,550 million SEK.  
 Respect for nature and sustainable resource use in our shops 
and distribution centres  
H&M operates 945 shops and 13 distribution centres (DC's). Our 
operations result in waste from packaging, hangers, decorative materials, 
disposable materials etc. It is our ambition to reduce waste and re -use and 
recycle wast e material when possible.  
 
VALUE ADDED  
 
Major Products and services  
At H&M, everyone is working towards the same goal – giving the customer 
unbeatable value through the combination of fashion, quality and price. 
H&M’s concept of quality means that custome rs must be satisfied with 
both our products and with H&M as a company.  
  
We have a wide range of products and new goods are delivered to our 
stores every day. To make things clearer for our customers, we have 
divided the range into a number of different concepts. We offer fashion 
basics as well as clothes with high fashion content within each collection, 
so that customers easily can combine different garments and find their 
own personal style. This allows customers to choose from a wide range – 
from updat ed classics to the trendiest garments, from newborn baby to 
fully- grown adult.  
 
Our stores are designed to allow customers to make their own choices 
easily. The aim is to create a comfortable and inspiring atmosphere in the 
store that makes it simple for customers to find what they want and to feel 
at home. It is important to provide customers with ideas and inspiration, so 
that they can choose what suits their own style. We do this through our 
garment displays and mannequins that provide inspiration for m atching 
and styling tips.  
 
H&M has been selling cosmetics since 1975. Today H&M sells cosmetics 
in Scandinavia, Germany, the UK, Austria, Spain, Portugal, France, The 
Netherlands and Italy. H&M places great emphasis on having a 
fashionable, good value ran ge of high quality products with a high fashion content. The product range now includes hair care and body care, make -
up and accessories for men, women, and youth.  
 
Since 1980 H&M has offered its customers an alternative and convenient 
way of shopping by mail order. This business is managed by H&M 
Rowells. Here, again, the aim is to provide fashion and quality at the best 
price. Mail order shopping is currently available in Sweden, Norway, 
Finland, and Denmark.  
 
In 1998 H&M began its shopping online servi ce, when e -commerce was 
first started as a test activity in Sweden. In 1999, the activity was extended 
to Denmark and Finland and in 2001, our online shop expanded to 
Norway.

Suppliers  
We do not have any factories of our own, b ut instead work with around 
750 suppliers. Around 50 percent of the production takes place in Europe 
and the rest mainly in Asia. We make an effort to co -operate only with 
suppliers meeting a number of requirements in respect to compliance with 
our Code of  Conduct, quality, capacity and punctual deliveries to mention 
a few of the most important ones. H&M endeavours to bring about long -
term relationships with suppliers. Continuous co -operation with our 
suppliers helps us to ensure that our requirements are m et. 
 
Production offices  
In order to be able to follow up production, H&M has 21 production offices 
in Europe, Asia, and Africa with nearly 700 people employed. The role of 
the production office is to serve as a link between the buying office and the 
suppli ers. That can for example include order -placement, quality control, 
and follow -up of other H&M’s requirements including compliance with our 
Code of Conduct.  
 
Distribution  
Every stage in the transport chain, starting with the forwarder, is controlled 
by H& M acting as importer and retailer. Once the garments are ready for 
shipment, they are distributed to H&M's stores via distribution centres. 
Most sales countries (with the exception of Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, 
Italy and the Czech Republic) have a distr ibution centre where the clothes 
are checked and, if necessary, steamed before being sent on to the 
stores. Having few links and as few stops as possible in the distribution 
chain makes the supply of goods efficient. H&M sells more than 500 
million items a  year.

LISTENING TO OUR 
STAKEHOLDERS  
 
We think it is imperative to interact and have a dialogue with our various 
stakeholders. The values of society are constantly shifting and knowing 
what our stakeholders expect from us is essential to our business. We will 
only earn the “licence to operate” and the “licence to grow “ if we meet 
those expectations.  
 
Meeting our Stakeholders 2003

Board of Directors’ work  
Since the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2003 the Board of directors 
has had 13 members, of which 4  are deputy members (8 men and 5 
women). The Board of Directors met six times during the financial year. At 
the statutory meeting following the AGM Stefan Persson was re -elected 
Chairman of the Board and the Board adopted rules of procedure for its 
work. T he rules of procedure regulate matters such as the distribution of 
work between the Board and the Managing Director, financial repor -ting, 
investments and financing policy. The rules also call for the Board to hold 
five ordinary meetings annually, the stat utory meeting not included. In its 
work the Board of Directors has kept abreast of the financial development 
and position of the Group, made decisions on investments for the 
forthcoming financial year, resolved on expansion into new markets, 
decided on new  pension arrangements for the Managing Director, 
established a communications policy and kept up -to-date on organizational 
changes. During the year an audit committee was formed, with Stig 
Nordfelt as Chairman and Werner Hofer and Bo Lundquist as members. 
The audit committee has met twice.  
 
Board fees  
Board fees for the year as approved by the AGM amounted to SEK 
3,900,000 (3,900,000), of which SEK 2,700,000 (2,700,000) was paid to 
the Chairman of the Board. No Board fees were paid to Board members 
who are also employees of the company. The Board comprises of nine 
ordinary members and four deputy members. Five of the members are 
female and eight male; five out of thirteen are employed within the 
company.  
 
Managing Director’s terms of employment  
Remuneration to the Managing Director in the form of salary and benefits 
amounted to SEK 8,358,000, which included a bonus of SEK 1,500,000 
(previous year SEK 7,621,000 including a bonus of SEK 1,500,000). 
Pension expenses for the Managing Director during the year were  SEK 
23,290,000 (previous year SEK 3,707,000), of which SEK 19,911,000 
comprises pension commitments entered as liabilities. The Managing 
Director may retire at the age of 62 and receive a pension of 65% of regular salary at ordinary pension age. From the age of 65 the Managing 
Director will receive a lifelong old -age pension of 50% of the regular salary 
effective at the time. The Managing Director is entitled to 12 months’ 
notice. In the event that the company should cancel his contract of 
employment the M anaging Director will receive an extra year’s salary as 
severance pay, in addition to the 12 months’ notice. There are no other 
agreements regarding severance pay in the Group.  
 
Terms of employment for other Group senior executive officers  
Remuneration to other members of the Group management in the form of 
salary and benefits amounted to SEK 19,215,000 (18,039,000), which 
included bonuses of SEK 1,500,000 (SEK 1,500,000). Other Group 
management comprises 10 people, 3 of whom are female. In addition to 
the Managing Director, the management group includes those responsible 
for the following functions: finance, buying, product range, expansion, IR, 
accounts, marketing, HR, communications plus environment and social 
responsibility. There are rulings in respect of supplements to retirement 
pensions beyond the usual plan which cover certain senior employees. 
The retirement age for these varies between 60 and 62 years. The cost of 
these payments has been covered by separate insurance policies. In 
addition, a bonus amounting to SEK 6 m (6) was paid to 12 country 
managers (12).  
 
Bonus system  
The Managing Director, country managers and certain senior executives 
are included in a bonus system. The size of the bonus is based on 0.2% of 
the increase in the ordinary divide nd decided by the Annual General 
Meeting, which is then adjusted to take account of the result in their 
respective areas of the business. The maximum bonus per person and 
year has been set at SEK 500,000. In the case of the Managing Director 
the bonus is 0 .6% of the ordinary dividend increase, up to a maximum of 
SEK 1,500,000. The bonus paid after tax must be invested in its entirety in 
shares in the company, which must be held for a minimum of five years.  
  11 Specific related party disclosures  
The H&M Group  already leases the following store premises in properties 
directly or indirectly owned by Stefan Persson and family: Drottninggatan 
50–52 in Stockholm, Kungsgatan 55 in Gothenburg, Stadt Hamburgsgatan 
9 in Malmö and Amagertorv 23 in Copenhagen. Store prem ises in the 
following properties have been added during the year:  Drottninggatan 56 
and Sergelgatan 11 in Stockholm. Rent is paid at market rates and 
amounted to a total of SEK 42 m for the financial year. Previous year SEK 
31 m.  
 HUMAN RESOURCES  
 
The sp irit of H&M creates commitment  
At the end of the 
year, H&M had 
around 40,000 
employees. The 
average number 
of employees was 
28,409 (converted 
into full -time 
positions), of 
which 20 per cent 
were male. Net 
employment 
creation has been 
15% on average 
the la st six years. 
The chart 
illustrates this as 
well as yearly job 
net creation.  
  
 
H&M’s seven fundamental values  
H&M’s strong corporate culture – the spirit of H&M – has existed ever 
since the days of H&M’s founder, Erling Persson. This strong culture is of 
great value and is a contributory factor to H&M’s successes over the 
years. Constantly finding new staff around the world while at the same 
time retaining and communicating the particular spirit of H&M on which the 
company is based is a major challenge.  
 
The spirit of H&M is based on a number of values that describe in simple 
terms how we want to work. These are  
in turn based on our business concept – fashion and quality at the best 
price. The fundamental values behind the spirit of H&M are common 
sense, t aking own initiatives, believe in people, direct communication, cost 
consciousness, team work and fast pace with continual improvement.  Creating Employment

Access to economic opportunity 
through employment  
 
Several countries that are found 
among the Least Developed 
Countries (LDC) produce the 
garments that are sold by H&M. We 
are working with som e 750 suppliers 
in Europe and Asia who in turn work 
with around 2900 factories that 
employ approximately 530.000 
workers.   12  
Transferring the culture to new stores and countries  
When H&M opens a new store the staff gets support from experienced  
staff at established H&M stores. They help to build up the store, recruit 
staff and run the business. In addition, they are important bearers of the 
culture who help pass on H&M’s values to the new employees in a simple 
way. All this creates cross -border understanding, creativity and 
commitment. Generally, H&M staff within a country assists each other. 
When H&M opens stores in new countries, however, it is even more 
important to provide support and to transfer knowledge from staff in 
established countries.  Staff with language skills stay from two weeks to 
two months to help during the start -up phase. Often a number of 
specialists will relocate to the new country for a longer period in order to 
pass on their specialist skills, so that the business can get go ing quickly. 
Transferring knowledge and the culture to the new countries Poland, the 
Czech Republic, Portugal and Italy, has been made considerably easier by 
the fact that their neighbouring countries have assisted with construction, 
warehousing and admini stration. The basic framework is already in place 
and committed employees have ensured that the new countries have 
gained the knowledge and natural understanding of H&M’s values that is 
so important when expanding the business.  
 
H&M Wallpaper and H&M Maga zine 
Since 1997 our staff newspaper H&M News has been one of a number of 
ways in which we have passed on information and strengthened the 
corporate culture. In 2004 H&M News will be replaced by two journals: a 
wall-posted newspaper called H&M Wallpaper and  a fashion magazine 
called H&M Magazine. H&M Magazine, which describes the fashions and 
the latest trends, is aimed equally at both staff and customers.  
Responsibility creates creativity  
Within H&M we provide room for people to make their own decisions and  
take responsibility and staff gets regular feedback on their performance. It 
is an important part of H&M’s culture that responsibility is delegated to the 
stores. Creativity and job satisfaction increase when there is a good 
working environment. The idea is to create as much commitment as 
possible within certain given confines.  
 Internal 
recruitment takes 
precedence  
H&M principally 
recruits internally. 
Staff recruited from 
outside the 
company is primarily 
sales staff for the 
stores, who later 
form a good 
recruitment base for 
positions of 
responsibility both 
within the stores and 
in other areas of 
H&M. This gives our 
employees every 
opportunity to 
develop continually, 
while at the same 
time ensuring that 
the spirit of H&M is 
spread throughout the company.  
 
Job rotation and skills development  
Job rotation is common at H&M. In the stores, for example, duties may 
vary between the cash desk, fitting rooms and deliveries to goods display, 
advertising and campaigns. Working in the store provides very important 
expe rience and is a way of getting to know H&M from its very foundation. 
Attracting and retaining skilled staff is important for H&M’s success. We 
therefore work constantly on skills development and all training is carried 
out within our own organisation. Howe ver, the biggest knowledge gain is 
made through active learning on the job. All new members of staff are 
given a mentor. Newly employed store staff undergoes a three -week  
introduction programme and they thereafter have regular training as 
needed in custome r care, textiles and display. The introduction 
programme guarantees that everyone has an equal grounding in and 
insight into H&M’s way of working. Management training is also carried 
out, with the emphasis on being a good communicator of H&M’s values.  H&M’s contribution to the Millenium 
Development goals:  
 
Achieve universal primary education  
 
Child prevention project in Southern India  
For the fourth consecutive year H&M is donating 45 000  Euro 
to Terre des hommes in Germany. The donation supports a 
local Indian organization in southern India that works on 
preventing child labour in the Tirupur area, where a lot of 
textiles are produced.  
 
The project aims at persuading parents to allow thei r children 
to go to school rather than working. Through organising 
evening classes and weekend activities for the children, the 
Indian organization works to enable children to return to 
normal schooling.  
 
H&M has chosen to support this organization via Te rre des 
hommes in Germany, which works to help vulnerable children 
around the world. It works not just on the problem of child 
labour, but also on other important child issues such as child 
soldiers and child prostitution.  
  13  
Employees’ freedom of association – a core value for H&M  
H&M’s core commitment to its employees includes among other things fair 
wages, reasonable working hours, and the freedom of association. This 
applies to all H&M operations around the world, as well as t o companies 
supplying clothes and other products to H&M. There can be no doubt that 
H&M recognizes the legal and human right for our employees to seek 
representation, and to join the trade union of their choice.  
 
Agreement with UNI  
On January 14, 2004, H& M signed an agreement with the global trade 
union UNI (Union Network International), This agreement declares in 
writing that both parties consider the ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work to be the cornerstone for their corporation.  It 
also makes clear within and outside the company, H&M’s corporate policy 
on, among other areas, freedom of association and the right to collective 
bargaining at H&M’s workplaces. It is of utmost importance to ensure the 
observance of these principles in  the future.  
 
The U.S. Case  
H&M’s core values are valid all over the world. The U.S. is no exception. It 
is therefore important for us to clearly state that the accusations that 
during the past autumn have been made against H&M in the U.S. were 
unfounded.  
 
In H&M’s efforts to reach a satisfactory agreement about the process to 
establish whether H&M’s workplaces in the U.S. should be organised, 
discussions will be held with the central U.S. trade union AFL -CIO. The 
process to decide if a union has a majorit y at an H&M workplace should be 
in line with American practice – and should be carried out in a way that 
protects the integrity of our employees. This is the basic guideline for 
H&M’s proposal to those American unions that seek to organize our 
employees in  the U.S.  
 
During the summer of 2003, the American union Unite initiated a campaign 
to organize the employees at H&M’s distribution centre in New Jersey, 
USA. Shortly thereafter, H&M met with representatives from Unite and 
initiated a dialogue. In March 20 04, H&M and Unite reached an agreement 
about how to conduct the work place election. The agreement is important since it protects the integrity of our employees. The result from the election 
will be ready in April 2004.  
 
Organisation  
The company management  is based at H&M’s head office in Stockholm. 
Stockholm is also where the main functions for design and buying, finance, 
expansion, shop fitting and display, advertising, communications,  human 
resources, logistics, security, corporate social responsibility,  and IT are  
located. H&M has 13 country offices that are responsible for the various 
functions in each sales country. The country office in Belgium is 
responsible for administration of the Luxembourg stores. Our new markets 
are also administered from their  neighbouring countries: Poland by 
Germany, the Czech Republic by Austria, Portugal by Spain, and Italy by 
Switzerland. H&M also has 21 production offices which take care of 
contacts with our approximately 750 suppliers. There are ten production 
offices in  Europe, ten in Asia, and one in Africa.

 14 SECURITY AT H&M  
 
Our Security policy guides our security work. We centre our attention on:  
 
n Fire prevention/Evacuation  
n Loss prevention  
n Crime prevention  
 
It is key to us that the security work becomes an integrated part of 
everyday work. The security manual is a valuable help to all shop 
managers about information and checklists around all specifics.   
 
Security Organisation  
In general, every Shop Manager, Distr ibution Centre Manager, Division 
Head, Office Manager etc are responsible for Security issues. At their 
service, there is a corporate organisation to facilitate and govern the 
security work in the group. The head of Security reports to the CEO.  
 
The corpo rate organisation also includes security managers for the 
following areas:  
 
n Information and Information Technology.  
n Internal audit  
 
In addition, there is a Security Manager for the:  
 
n Buying Office and Production offices  
n Sales offices and Shops (14 people for 19 countries)  
n H&M Rowells  
n IT Department  Crime  
 
Risk Assessment  
Every Shop Manager must, in collaboration with the security manager of 
the country, analyse the risks for crime against the shop and train the staff 
accordingly.  
 
Consequences of crime  
We report all types of internal and external crime to the police. Any 
employee who has been found guilty of committing a crime against the 
company will be dismissed/given notice.  
 
Combating Bribery  
 
H&M does not give or take any form of bribes. We dissociate  ourselves 
from all types of corruption. This is valid for every individual employed by 
H&M, regardless of business area or position.  
 H&M Security Policy  
H&M must be a place where both staff and customers can feel safe. 
Every employee of the company must, in their daily work and personal 
behaviour, st rive to create a working climate that avoids the risk of fire, 
criminal behaviour and damage to both customers and staff – without in 
any way limiting space for spontaneity and creativity in daily activities 
together or hindering sales in the company’s sho ps. A properly 
functioning security system, where everything is ordered and well 
organised, creates a safer place in which to work; it reduces the 
company’s costs for damage and loss and contributes to increased 
profitability and comfort.   15 Internet policy  
Rapid access to correct information is important if we are all to do our 
jobs in the best way possible. The Internet is a source of information 
that can be used to supplement and rationalise this knowledge 
gathering. The Internet is intended for the gathe ring of information and 
knowledge for business purposes. Employees must be aware that it is 
an external medium in which - as in all other external situations – he or 
she is representing the company.  
Employees who wish to have access to information on the I nternet from 
their PC in order to carry out their work undertake to abide by the 
following Internet policy.  
 
n Websites that supply pornographic, racist, or other unethical or 
unlawful information must not be visited from H&M’s computers. 
Storage of such inf ormation on H&M’s computers is absolutely 
prohibited and may result in dismissal.  
n The user shall always be responsible for observing the necessary 
security measures, copyright rules and licensing procedures for 
software, sound and images when downloading v ia the Internet.  
n The employee does not object to the company checking the 
Internet addresses to which he/she has been connected.  Code of Ethics – Our Corruption policy  
The Code of Ethics is a document stating the rules for what is considered 
corrupt  behaviour. Our approximately 700 employees in our production 
offices sign this document, upon employment.  
 
In addition, our suppliers have signed to confirm that:  
 
n They have taken part and fully understood H&M’s Code of Ethics  
 
n That the requirements in H &M’s Code of Ethics are not in any way 
contradictory to the national law.  
 
n They commit to comply with H&M’s Code of Ethics, to take the 
responsibility of informing all their subcontractors about the content of 
the Code of Ethics, and to make sure they also  comply accordingly.  
 
They are also requested to immediately inform the Production Office 
Manager if a corruption situation occurred in dealing with our staff.  
 
Enforcement and Control  
The Security Manager for the Production Offices always conducts inter nal 
revisions on the Code of Ethics procedure to make sure it has been 
implemented correctly. If a corruption case occurs, the Security Manager 
will be informed and will deal with this accordingly.  
 
If a supplier does not comply with our company policy in  this matter, we 
will be forced to discontinue all business connections with this supplier.  
 
If an employee is found taking bribes of any kind, it will be reported to the 
police for investigation.  
 
Information and IT Security  
The Information Security Poli cy and Guidelines is guiding all security work 
on information and IT. These instructions are covering:  
 
n Organisation and Responsibility  
n Asset classification and control  n Document and information management  
n Physical security  
n Communication and operations mana gement  
n Access Control  
n Systems development and maintenance  
n Routines for incident management  
n Business continuity planning  
 
The intention is for H&M’s security work to be harmonised with the 
standard SS -ISO/IEC -17799 Information security management. All our 
work shall at least meet legal requirements.  
  16 Policy  
The levels of the security procedures are depending on the possible  
damage of threat that could be carried out against H&M: s businesses.  
 
Responsibility and support  
Security is a line responsibility tha t extends from the operation manager all 
the way to the fellow worker. The information security manager 
coordinates and monitors the security work and revises the security level – 
he/she is the business support within the information security area.  
 
Risk A nalysis  
Damage prevention and damage -limiting measures shall be preceded by a 
risk analysis and be economically well balanced to the identified risks.  
 
Consequences when disregarding laws, regulations, and the 
internal rules  
Staff who is not following the valid laws and regulations can be dismissed. 
Staff who is not following the internal rules can get a warning and in 
serious cases be dismissed. We report all types of crime to the police.

Main aspects  
n The environmental impact in the supply chain  
 
The most substantial environmental effects occur in the dyeing and 
processing of fibres and fabrics. Examples of aspects in the garment 
production are energy consumption, water pollution, and chemical 
handling. H&M’s Code of Conduct includes requirements on the 
environment.  
 
n Environmental considerations on Transportation  
 
Transportation of H&M goods stands for approximately 46% of total 
carbon dioxide emissions caused by H&M operations. Therefore, it is vital 
for H&M, in cooperation with our transporters and service providers, to try 
to achieve more environmentally friendl y transports.  
 
n Respect for nature and sustainable resource use in our shops and 
distribution centres  
 
H&M operates 945 shops and 13 distribution centres (DC's). Our operation 
result in waste from packaging, hangers, decorative materials, disposable 
materi als etc. It is our ambition to reduce waste and re -use and recycle 
waste material when possible. H&M’s Environmental Policy  
Continuous improvements are significant for all H&M activities. This  includes our 
environmental eff ort, which is conducted within the framework of our business 
operations. H&M's business concept is to give our customers unsurpassed value 
by offering fashion and quality at the best price. Our quality concept is based on 
ensuring that our customers are sa tisfied with our products and H&M as a 
company.  
 
To this end, we are committed to acting responsibly in our community. We shall 
also co -operate with our suppliers to improve the social and environmental 
standards in the factories that manufacture H&M cloth ing, thereby contributing to 
sustainable development in these areas. To achieve this goal, H&M has adopted 
the following principles.  
 
We shall:  
 
- always consider the health and safety of our employees. By adopting the 
precautionary principle, we will cont inuously update  our restrictions against the 
use of environmentally and health  hazardous chemicals in the production of our 
garments and other products.  
 
- continuously update ourselves on environmental news and legislation. We will 
not be content to follo w existing environmental legislation, but will in certain areas 
do more than the law requires.  
 
- conduct our business in a manner that utilises natural resources as efficiently as 
possible.  
 
- develop new and continuously improve existing environmental re quirements 
concerning the purchase of products and services.  
 
- train, inform and motivate our employees to participation and responsibility, 
thereby making environmental work an integrated part of H&M daily routines.  
 
- specify for our suppliers our posit ion regarding behaviour towards the 
environment and human rights and follow up to ensure that our suppliers improve 
their operations according to these requirements.   23 ENVIRONMENTAL 
IMPACT 
ASSESSMENT  
The Environmental Impact Assessment 
is an environmental impact estimation 
produced by two experts, one with 
decades of experience in the textile 
business, and one with the 
environmental kn owledge. Corrections 
to the table are done when needed. If 
changes are done with any major 
consequence for our decisions, this will 
be stated in this report.  
 
The table is divided in environmental 
aspects (e.g. emissions to air) and 
impact areas (e.g. sto res). Every impact 
area has been weighted within 
brackets, in order of importance. For 
example, we consider the production of 
garments to have the most critical 
impact on the environment.  
 
Every environmental aspect is weighted 
within each impact area with  one or 
more x. symbols, where three x stands 
for “Very Significant”. We also 
summarize the impact of each 
environmental aspect in the far right 
column. Emissions to air, for example, 
we consider most pressing among the 
environmental aspects (27x)  Aspects  Stores (2)  Distribution

H&M´s Environmental organisation  
H&M’s Corporate Social Responsibility Manager (CSR) is part of the 
corporate management and reports directly to our Managing Director.  
 
The Environmental Co -ordinator coordinates environmental activities  at 
H&M. H&M has environmental representatives for the following corporate 
functions; Advertising, travel, logistics, Rowells, Building and IT. The prime 
function for a representative is to be the communicative link between the 
line organisation and the CS R department that facilitates and govern the 
environmental work in the group. Every major production country and 
every sales office also have their environmental representatives. There are 
32 environmental representatives in total.  
 
Certification  
H&M is n ot ISO14001 -certified. Our ways of working do not correspond 
with the type of bureaucracy that comes with ISO certification. 
Nevertheless, we consider it important with a systematic approach to our 
environmental work. Environmental considerations should be  an integral 
part of our everyday decisions and operations.  
 
Organic Cotton  
Since we are aware of the negative environmental impact of cotton 
farming, we are planning to start partly using organic cotton for our 
products. Organic cotton is certified to be  naturally grown without the use 
of synthetic pesticides, defoliants and fertilizers.  
During 2003, we have investigated the possibilities to buy products 
containing organic cotton from Turkey and from India. The first test orders 
from Turkey were shipped i n March 2004. In India, the situation is more 
complex, but we are hoping to be able to start a test late 2004 or 2005. 
From both markets, we intend to use a blend of 95% traditionally grown 
cotton and 5% organic cotton, and we will use it in our children’s  wear range. The volumes will initially be very small, but we intend to gradually 
increase the volumes year by year in order to help increase the worldwide 
demand for organic cotton. The garments will not have a special label and 
we will not make a separat e organic collection.  
 
Environmental evaluation of Transportation Service Providers  
Since 2001, the Transportation Service Providers are evaluated on a 
variety of environmental issues in order to improve their environmental 
performance.  
 
Minimum Environ mental Requirements for Road Transports  
From The 1st of January 2003, we have the following minimum 
environmental requirements for companies performing goods transports 
on road.  
 
n Use of Euro 1 engines (or equivalent)  
n Purchase of (new and used) vehicles in minimum Euro 2 /US 94  
n Diesel with maximum sulphur content of 350 ppm (0,035%)  
n Instructions to drivers to use certain fuel quality  
n Fuel-efficient driving (ECO -driving): 25% of drivers must have received 
theoretical and practical training.  
n Company policy ba nning idling in excess of 1 minute  
 
Coming minimum requirements for road transports  
n Road transports for H&M must be carried out with vehicles meeting 
the requirements of Euro 2 or US 94 (from January 2006)  
n All vehicles purchased must meet the requirements of Euro 3 /US 98 
(from January 2005)  
n At least 50% of drivers must have received theoretical and practical 
training in fuel -efficient driving (“eco -driving”) (from January 2005)  
 
 
In our evaluation during 2003 (for year 2002), we found two Transportation 
Service Providers that did not meet our minimum requirements on 
engines. They were required to show an action plan on how to comply with  25 the requirements that came into place from January 2003. Both 
Transportation Service Providers showed satisfactory plans on how to 
meet our demands. In 2004, we will make random checks of the fulfilment 
of our minimum requirements.  
 
Minimum environmental requirements for other Business 
Partners  
n H&M uses minimum environmental requirements when purchasing 
Shop Equipment  
 
Apart from any legal requirements there are also some H&M specific 
environmental requirements. The following materials, metals and 
chemicals should generally be avoided in the production process or the 
product itself:  
 
n Materials:  PVC (Polyvinyl chloride), H alogen -based plastic materials, 
Paper -based materials processed with chlorine or chlorine derivates 
and Tropical wood (never use such wood if not labelled FSC)  
 
n Metals:  Lead, Chrome (especially Cr6+), Cadmium, Mercury  
 
n Chemicals:   Bisphenol A, Brominated o r chlorinated flame –
retardants, e.g. PBB, PBDE, OctaBDE, TEPA, TCEP, TRIS, 
Bis(2,3dibromopropyl)phosphate, chloroparaffins), Chlorinated or 
aromatic organic solvents, Ozone depleting compounds,  
Nonylphenolethoxylates (NPE), Formaldehyde.  
 H&M uses minim um environmental requirements when 
purchasing IT Products  
H&M uses the ECO declaration developed by The Nordic IT -Organisations 
(NITO). Nemko2 randomly examines the information declared by the 
companies selling IT equipment for verification purposes. Nemko  works on 
the commission of NITO. Each year 25% of the companies selling IT 
equipment are examined. If a company is found consciously declaring 
false information, NITO will expel that member.  Our different supplier of 
IT-equipment has to send in one eco d eclaration for every product they 
offer. We evaluate all answers to find an acceptable level. Any product that 
does not live up to the law is automatically sorted out. The requirements 
we have set are based on legislation and our own standard, i.e. no PVC.   
                                 2 The Nemko Group is a Norwegian company that offers testing, 
inspection and certification services concerning products, machinery, 
installations, and systems world wide.  Building and Visual Merchandising – New decisions for a 
cleaner environment  
 
n Make sure in  the building and rebuilding process that source sorting and 
waste handling areas are sufficient either in the store or provided by 
landlord.  
n To separate hazardous waste at demolition  
n To have a contractual agreement with the contractors stating that we 
have the right to an Environmental Declaration for all used material, if we 
require it.  
n Floors must be PVC free and we shall phase out PVC in other 
appliances  
n To avoid the purchase of tropical wood. Any tropical wood purchased 
must be FSC certified.  
n To insta ll water saving appliances in washrooms and kitchens  
n To phase out R22 (hazardous refrigerant) in the cooling systems in all 
countries  
n To make sure that cadmium and nonylphenol etoxilate does not exist in 
paint that is purchased locally (already  implement ed centrally).  
  26 New packing instructions for our suppliers  
In order to reduce waste from plastic and cartons and to make packing 
and transport more efficient changes have been made in the packing 
instructions to achieve the following:  
 
n Reduction of Plastic, Filling pa per and Tissue paper  
n Reduction of Carton boxes  
n Reduction of hanging garments  
n Reduction of hangers  
 
 
 Environmental Objectives  
 
n Promotion of environmental awareness  among 
employees, suppliers and customers  
 
n Respect for nature:  
Caution in decision -making out of respect for nature  
 
n Sustainable resource use:

  27 The SEMS Project  
 
Introduction  
H&M wants to take responsibility for the environmental impact of our operations 
in the supply chain. It is our ambition to make our suppliers aware of the 
importa nce of improving the production processes in the entire chain of 
production. Through the requirements in our Code of Conduct, we make clear 
that environmental laws must be followed and that the supplier must possess 
all required permits.  
 
However, through  the SEMS project we wanted to move forward and in so 
doing further contribute to the reduction of the environmental impact of the 
production of our products.  
 
The Project Strategy  
The authorities in many of the countries where H&M's garments are produced  
do not necessarily have the same monitor and audit systems in place to check 
the compliance with laws and regulations. Hence, our suppliers must see the 
advantages of taking their own responsibility. We have therefore decided to use 
education and inspirat ion as our premier tools to achieve  the motivation 
necessary for reaching the goals of the project.  
 
The Project Steps  
In this project, four vertical factories (i.e. factory with all the wet processes in 
house) were taking part. The suppliers’ factories are located in Indonesia, India, 
Turkey, and Portugal. They participate voluntarily in the project.  
The first step,  was to perform an initial environmental review (IER). The IER 
focused on the environmental aspects of activities in the factories and grade d 
the aspects due to their significance. Finally, suggestions on improvements 
were given.  
 
The next step was for the supplier to set environmental targets, based on the 
IER, to improve their environmental performance. A designated person was 
required to t ake responsibility for the targets and a time frame was set.  
 
The final step, which was concluded in 2003, was to evaluate actions taken by 
the suppliers. The analysis was made and the major findings and conclusions 
are laid out in this chapter.  THE SEMS PROJECT EVA LUATION  
 
Major findings  
It is easier to motivate suppliers to make concrete improvements when 
there are multiple gains. Even if a supplier can be willing to make 
improvements out of concerns about the environment, the motivation is 
higher if other gains can also be made, such as reduced cost, reduced use 
of resources, better quality, lower waste etc. The gains must be 
measurable. The  cost must be realistic in proportion to the gains. It is 
difficult to achieve sustainable improvements unless the supplier clearly 
sees the business benefits.  
 
The suppliers have shown substantial interest in becoming ISO 14001 
certified although this was  originally not within the scope of the project.  At 
times the two objectives, fulfilling the targets set for the SEMS3 project and 
getting the ISO 14001 certificate, were mixed up. This has made it difficult 
in the end to fully evaluate only the SEMS proje ct.  
 
The conclusion is that it is possible to achieve certain environmental 
improvements through an awareness and motivation approach. Further 
lessons learned were:  
 
n On a general level we have learned a lot about the driving forces and 
hindrances to impr ovements concerning issues with environmental 
consequences.  
 
n We have identified the most important environmental aspects. This 
has been useful for determining the relevant areas of interest for  the 
revised environmental section of the Code of Conduct check list.  
 
                                 3 SEMS – Supplier Environmental Motivation Strategy  
  28 Our knowledge was increased on the environmental impact of the 
various production steps.  
 
n Understanding of the various obstacles and difficulties that our 
suppliers encounter in the process towards improved environmental 
awareness and performance.   
 
n As always, key to internal engagement is management commitment 
and competence.  
n The pilot suppliers were motivated to make improvements on their 
environmental practice that went beyond the law.  
 
Environmental benefits explored  
 
n The improvements were foc used on resource use where the producer 
benefits environmentally and economically. The achievements often 
concerned energy saving. Some examples were isolation of pipes, 
reuse of steam, and heat exchangers.  
 
n Changes in the processes sometimes meant that l ess auxiliary 
chemicals and water were needed.  
 
n By using the counter current flow principles in non -sensitive parts of 
the processes; reuse of water and heat could be attained.  
 
n Some processes can become more efficient through cutting the 
resource use. F or example, through precise control of the processes, 
chemicals and heat in surplus can be minimized and excluded. This 
changes often leads to better quality of the products since the 
production process become more even.  
  
How the knowledge accumulated in the project should be 
spread to other suppliers.  
The SEMS project resulted in three initiatives:  
 
1. The first outcome is the revised environmental section of the Code 
of Conduct checklist. Apart from the fact that we are requiring 
environmental considera tions on hazardous waste, chemical 
handling, wastewater treatment, our inspectors increase the 
suppliers’ awareness and knowledge in the dialogue on these 
topics.  
 
2. Secondly, we will also educate selected vertical garment suppliers 
on the successes from the  SEMS project.  
 
3. In 2004, we will initiate cooperation with the largest fabric suppliers 
used by our garment suppliers in our largest sourcing markets. 
The purpose is to improve the environmental performance of their 
operations. We will share with them the good examples from the 
SEMS project.  
 H&M’s c ontribution to the Millenium Development goals:  
 
Ensure environmental sustainability   
 
Through our Code of Conduct we require our suppliers to comply 
with all applicable environmental laws and regulations in their 
country of operation.  
 
Through the Chemic al Restrictions and corresponding tests, we 
take our responsibility in making sure that prohibited chemical 
substances are not present in our products.   29 ENVIRONMENTAL INFORM ATION TO 
EMPLOYEES  
 
Our environmental information is communicated through a number of 
different channels. Colleagues who make decisions with high impact on 
environment are targeted with more in dep th education. For other 
employees we mainly focus on awareness building.  
 
The channels of communication  
n H&M's intranet  - Our intranet is covering all offices in H&M. No shop 
is included yet.  
 
n H&M's website at internet ( www.hm.com/csr ) - Here one can 
download the CSR Report. Hence, this is where the most 
comprehensive information is found.  
 
n H&M's staff news (H&M News ) -Our newsmagazine is distributed to 
every employee in the company.  
 
n Education at the Buying Office (o ptional ) – This education takes 
place approximately 3 times per year.  
 
n Key Group Education  - During 2003, key group education was given 
to Project managers - Building4 and Visual Merchandisers5.  
                                 4 The Project Managers are responsible for building and 
rebuilding of stores in the sales organisation  5 The Visual Merchandiser is responsible for presentation of the 
products in the store and the  window in their respective country, 
through them paint for window is bought locally they are also  
 
 
                                                                           
responsible for the volumes of material used in their field and 
hence also waste is a consequence of their work.  H&M’s contribution to the Millenium 
Development goals:  
 
Reduce child mortality, improve 
maternal health  & give access to safe 
drinking water  
 
H&M supports the Charity WaterAid who 
directs our donations on our request to a 
project in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Three types of data quality can be identified. Here we present information 
concerning the  
 
n Obtainment of data  
 
The obtainment accuracy is about absence  of data or old data.  
 
n Correctness of the source data. The correctness of the sourc e data is 
about the incorrect data or inaccurately calculated data. This 
correctness have not been assured or controlled in detail. However, an 
estimate on the size of energy consumption has been made.  
 
n Energy sources. In cases when the information on ener gy sources is 
missing, assumptions have been made. The data quality in this regard 
has 98% accuracy.  
 
Obtainment of data  
Our carbon dioxide data calculation last year failed to include the carbon 
dioxide data for our air transports. This was due to mainly two reasons. 
First, our air transports were considerably fewer last year and consisted 
mainly of transports purchased by our suppliers. Secondly, our transport 
service providers were not able to report any reliable carbon dioxide 
figures last year.  The pr oblem of getting reliable carbon dioxide figures 
still exists. However, based on the weight provided from our service 
providers, and the calculation methods (templates) given by the Swedish 
initiative NTM Calc ( www.ntm.a .se), we have been able to assemble 
reliable data. We know that these template calculations resulted in, due to 
their nature, lower emissions than what is true. However, according to our 
reference checks, we believe that the size of the emissions shall be  just 
about correct. Excluded in these calculations is the haulage from the 
airport to our warehouses.  
 
Ultimately, we should have reported the omissions on air transports last 
year, but unintentionally we failed to do so.  Additionally, we also realized w e missed figures for some of our German 
distribution centres. Due to these mistakes, we have recalculated the data 
accuracy for 2002.  
 
2002:  61% accurate (89% was stated in the last years’ report)  
 
2003:  96% accurate  
 
Carbon Dioxide Emissions in relation to Company Turnover 
(data excluding air transport)  
 
Ton Carbon Dioxide Emissions per 1000 SEK Turnover
2,202,402,602,803,00
2000 2001 2002 2003
  
Conclusions  
There is an 8% increase in Carbon Dioxide Emissions 2003 compared to 
2002 on the data excluding the air transports. This year there is also a 
relative increase compared to last year when measured against turnover. 
This increase is due to the purchase of more carbon dioxide intense 
electricity in Germany and Holland (Germany and Holland is approximately 
representing 36% of company turnover). Another reason is the addition of 
collected data from our stores in France (amounted to 2447 tonnes of 
carbon dioxide) as well as our distribution centres in Germany (amounted 
to 3166 tonnes of carbon dioxide).  
  32 The reasons for the decrease on comparable transports (excl. air)  instead 
of a raise in level with the increase of turnover are mainly two. First, data 
based on an expired transportation service was eliminated (amounted to 
4763 tonnes of carbon dioxide). Secondly, air transports have replaced 
boat transports on some occ asions.  
 
Altogether, we have reasons to believe that the figures this year are much 
more accurate than earlier years. That is why we now are changing the 
base year to 2003.  
 
Energy use  
From a cost perspective, energy use is continuously on the agenda in o ur 
operations due to the very clear link to cost cutting. However, our 
environmental department is currently not running any corporate energy -
cutting program and thus we choose not to report this indicator this year. 
Environmental aspects currently not mea sured  
 
Water  
As described in our impact assessment, emissions to water and use of 
water is a significant aspect in the production of the garment and in the 
use of the garment. For shops, offices and warehouses, the use of water is 
for sanitary needs. Due t o the complexity of collecting and aggregating the 
data, we have decided not to measure use of and emissions to water in 
our supply chain (production) or in the use of our products.  
 
NOx and SOx  
NOx and SOx are emissions mostly related to transports. Eva luating 
features like motor type and fuel type is at this point too complex to 
handle. Nevertheless, we are in this regard trying to cut the emissions 
from our transportation service providers trough our minimum 
requirements on motor type and fuel type.   
Waste Management  
As described in our impact assessment solid waste is a significant aspect 
in our stores and at our DC’s. The waste situation in our shops differs 
depending on the sales country. In Norway, for example, more than  
80 % of the shops are refe rred to the waste handling system of the 
shopping centre/landlord. In USA, on the other hand, more than 60% have 
a separate contract with a waste handling company. In Germany, more 
than 60% of the waste is sent back to H&M’s warehouse. Due to the  
mentioned  complexity, it is quite difficult for us to measure waste in total 
figures and the amounts in each separated fraction and their respective 
reuse or destination.  
 
However, the cardboard fraction is mainly collected at our Distribution 
Centres. In spite of  an increase in total volumes of 18%, and a shift from 
hanging transportation to garments packed in cardboard boxes, the 
increase in cardboard collected and recycled at our DC’s was only 9%.  
 
Cardboard in tons  Increase  
2002  2003    
12342    13 502  9% 
 
 
Green House Gas emissions in use and disposal  
It is not feasible, being a company mainly selling garments, to measure the 
emissions generated by use and disposal of the product. Neither would it 
be feasible to measure the emissions caused by our supply cha in. Just 
sewing and assembling of garments employs 2911 production units. 
These production units lack the possibilities of collecting and reporting any 
reliable figures   33 TARGETS 2003 AND ON

Social Responsibility   36 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEM ENT AND 
CODE OF CONDUCT  
 
Introducti on to our Code of Conduct work  
H&M is a value driven company that strives to perform our business in a 
responsible manner. We want to live up the expectations of our customers 
and staff and other stakeholders in the society. The following quote from 
our C ode of Conduct shows how we translate these values into a 
broadened responsibility for our supply chain.  
 
“H&M, as a strongly expanding multinational company, feels that it is 
increasingly important for us to take responsibility for all our actions, in 
Europe as well as in the rest of the world. Most importantly, we have a 
responsibility towards all the thousands of people taking part in the 
production of our garments. We have to make sure that nobody, whose 
work is contributing to our success, is deprived of his or her human rights, 
or suffers mental or bodily harm.”  
  
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work form the basis for this Code of 
Conduct. In 1997, we published our Code of Conduc t and in 1998, we 
made our first inspections. Since then, we have made more than 10.000 
inspections.  
 
We continuously improve our monitoring program and develop new tools 
and methods for implementation of the Code at our suppliers’ factories.  
 
n Our Code o f Conduct is found at 
http://seit26.hm.com/codeofconduct  
 
Improved conditions  
The improvements, since the start of our monitoring program, are 
substantial. The standard of fire safety and the working envir onment has 
been radically improved. In many cases, and according to the results of  
our evaluations, the working hours have come down and all workers now  
receive at least the legal minimum wage and frequently more. More and more factories also pay correct o ver time compensation. The right to paid 
annual leave; sick leave and maternity leave has become radically 
improved. In countries with a social security system, a majority of the 
workers are now covered.   
 
Currently we have our main focus on working hours , wages and other 
workers’ rights issues.  
 
To check wages, working hours, etc. we examine the documents that exist 
in the factories. In some case, we first had to get our suppliers to introduce 
meaningful reporting systems. For example, we made suggestions  for how 
payroll reporting should be organised, with columns for the total number of 
hours worked, the number of overtime hours and for any bonuses or 
deductions, so that it was clear how the final pay was calculated. Only 
once the new  reporting systems ha d been introduced were we able to 
effectively check that the  staff were getting the wages to which they were 
entitled.  
 
We are proud of what we have accomplished so far. However, we have so 
far developed few indicators to verify our achievements.  
 
We also realise that the work towards a sustainable supply chain where 
human rights and workers rights are being fully respected is difficult and 
will take long time.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Inspections  
In 2003, the number of inspections 
was 2232. Approximately every third 
re-inspection was unannounced.  
 
Factories  
In 2003, 2911 production units were 
registered. In these production units, 
there is approximately a workforce of 
530.000 people.

CSR Organisation  
H&M has around 30 Code of Conduct inspectors who carry out repeat ed 
inspections of supplier’s premises. The inspectors work at one of H&M’s 
21 production offices, where around 115 quality controllers also have the 
task of reporting any infringements of the Code of Conduct that they find. 
The CSR -department is a corporat e department with its manager reporting 
directly to the CEO.  CSR Reporting Structure

CoC Corordinators CoC Education and Processes
Environmental representativesEnvironmental Coordinator CSR ReportingCSR Manager Investor RelationsManaging Director 38 Training our inspectors  
The expectations on the performance of our CoC -inspectors are high. 
Hence, we need to facilitate the basic conditions for every inspector to 
meet these expectations.  
 
In order to secure the quality of the inspections and the continuous 
improvements towards Code of Conduct compliance among our suppliers’ 
production units, it is of utmost importance to:  
 
n Give our newly employed inspectors a good  introduction to both H&M 
and to their new profession.   
n Further educate and challenge our CoC -inspectors.  
 
Capacity building 2003  
During the year, 14 of our 30 inspectors teamed up with a colleague in 
another country in order to exchange knowledge and ideas to improve 
their work.  
 
Introduction to new inspectors  
In 2003 a plan on how to make a structured and systematic introduction to 
new inspectors was drafted and agreed upon.  
 
The introduction plan covers topics that should be communicated, written, 
orally or through practical tra ining. Some examples of the topics are:  
 
n Company values  
n Our Code of Conduct  
n The ILO Core Conventions  
n The role of the inspector  
n Relevant Labour Law  
n H&M’s latest CSR Report  
n H&M’s set of guidelines  
n How to make inspections  
 
The introduction is done by senior i nspectors or by the Stockholm based 
Code of Conduct Coordinators.  
 To further educate and challenge our CoC -inspectors  
Twice yearly, H&M is organising workshops for the inspectors and other 
key people in the production offices. These workshops are furthe r 
education for our inspectors with the purpose of exchanging best practices 
in different areas. Supply chain topics such as worker interviews, overtime, 
network building, piece -rate systems, migrant workers, work -methodology, 
and statistics are addressed.  In 2003, the workshops were held in 
Shanghai, China for our East and South -East Asian inspectors and in New 
Delhi, India South Asian inspectors. These workshops focused especially 
on environmental - and overtime issues, besides general development 
issues.n etworks  
 
Due to the strong advisory function of our inspectors, a whole network of 
local contact has to be built up in each location. Examples are lawyers with 
knowledge of local legislation, schools, voluntary organisations, 
authorities, trade unions, UN -representatives, industry associations, and 
competitors.  
Production  
We do not have any factories of our own. We buy our garments and 
other goods from approximately 750 suppliers, primarily in Europe 
and Asia. Our supply chain comprises mainly two types:  
 
Suppliers  are companies that have a direct business relationship to 
H&M. These companies may have factories of their own or they 
subcontract parts or their entire production. All variants exist, 
depending upon country.  
 
Sub-contractors  are companies that have been su bcontracted by 
our suppliers. They do not have a direct business relationship with 
H&M.  
 
Production units  – this term is used to describe factories producing 
clothes for H&M, whether it is a supplier’s factory or subcontractor’s 
factory.  
  39 BSR Labour Standards Working Group  
One of the important success factors commonly identified within the field 
of CSR is co -operation between companies within the garment industry. 
H&M participates in several formal and informal groups of garment brands 
and retailers working for a common goal of improving labour standards. 
One example of a formal group is the Labour Standards Working Group 
within BSR (Business for Social Responsibility).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT STR ATEGY  
 
To make sure that we reach our objectives and in order to gain trust from 
our stakeholders we need systems and procedures that are efficient and 
credible.  
 
Cooperation on a long -term basis  
We at H&M wish to work together with o ur suppliers, on a long -term basis, 
to improve the conditions in the factories. We strive to focus on a limited 
number of key suppliers in order to achieve better control of quality and 
working conditions. The number of suppliers we work with is now around  
750. 
 
We are sometimes asked why we do not immediately terminate our 
cooperation with suppliers who do not comply with our Code of Conduct. 
Obviously, that would be a simple solution for us, but H&M also feels a 
responsibility towards the people working i n the factories. If H&M leaves a 
factory due to poor management, the ones that are truly affected are the 
workers. Another buyer indifferent to workers’ rights might then replace 
H&M. The basis for sound cooperation is trust. Until proven otherwise, we 
have confidence in our suppliers and their subcontractors. However, we 
must not be naïve. For example, if we only make announced inspections, 
fire-safety, cleanliness etc could be temporary resolved.  
 
In our monitoring effort, there is a strong element of 
consultation/education/awareness making to really make our suppliers 
understand the importance and the advantages of complying with our 
code.  
 
 
Dealing with violations  
However, when we encounter serious violations a strong statement must 
be made. If the fact ory management is repeatedly faking documents or if a  
supplier has subcontracted production to a production site that is not  Objectives for t he Code of Conduct work  
When setting our yearly targets, we make sure that they lead to 
the following long -term objectives. Each objective is expressing 
an ideal condition that serves to direct us to what we are aiming 
for.  
 
n Full Code of Conduct Complianc e by all suppliers 
and their subcontractors.  
 
n Code of Conduct completely integrated with our 
business operations.  
The importance of Code of Conduct issues should be 
reflected in every day decisions as well as in strategic 
decisions.  
n Factory workers empow ered to claim their rights.  
The factory workers should be informed about labour 
laws and human rights according to national and 
international legislation. Their efforts in improving their 
working conditions should be supported.  
n Code of Conduct compliance m aintained through 
effective management systems.  
Tools and procedures should be developed in 
cooperation with the supplier.  
n Knowledge among our stakeholders about our 
Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.  
The information or education given should be ada pted 
to the various stakeholder groups.  
  40 known to us7 or in other ways refuses to cooperate, we are forced to cease 
the cooperation. In such cases, we try to terminate the business in a 
responsible manner in order to avoid sudden adverse affects for the 
workers.  
 
Extending the checklist on environmental issues  
In spring 2003 we started to use a more extensive checklist on 
environmental issues such as Hazardous waste, Wastewa ter treatment, 
and Chemicals. The purpose of this checklist is to map the environmental 
management of our suppliers on critical environmental aspects. Another 
reason is to advice our suppliers on sound environmental practices. 
Ultimately, the checklist hel ps us verify compliance to environmental 
legislation and regulations.  
 
 
COMPLIANCE AND INSPE CTION 
PROCEDURES  
 
Prior to Inspection  
n Compliance Commitment  - Supplier has to sign the Code of Conduct 
commitment before the first inspection. This commitment cove r the 
suppliers own unit as well as their subcontractors.  
 
The Inspection  
n Management interview  - The management is interviewed about 
relevant management practices, salaries, working hours, freedom of 
association etc. according to a fixed list of questions . 
 
n Document Review  - Documentation to verify working hours, wages 
and overtime compensation is checked. Staff records and age 
certificates are checked.  
                                 7 In case of an undeclared unit  (a unit not known to us), we have no way of 
checking the working conditions and cannot be sure that our requirements 
are being met.  
  
n Factory inspection  - The factory is inspected to  evaluate working 
environment, safety, child labour, et c in accordance with a checklist.  
 
n Closing meeting - The inspection results are discussed with the 
supplier, as well as realistic time limits for improvements.  
 
After the inspection  
n Corrective action plan  - The supplier signs the corrective action plan.  
 
Needs based actions  
n Inspection of residential area  - The residential facilities are 
inspected for cleanliness and safety according to a fixed list of items to 
check.  
 
n Pre-inspection questionnaire  – In very rare cases the supplier must 
fill in a pre -inspect ion self -assessment questionnaire. This happens 
when an inspection cannot be made immediately due to geographical 
distance.  
 
n Interviews with workers  - Information sometimes needs to be 
validated through interviews to ensure that the suppliers are observing  
our requirements.  Inspector tools  
n Inspection checklist - The inspector has a checklist to support the 
inspection. The checklist contains approximately 100 items that 
correlate to our code of conduct.  
 
n Evaluation checklist guidelines – To help the ins pector there are 
guidelines on how to use the evaluation checklist and how to manage 
interviews in the most efficient way.  
 
n Child labour guideline – To aid the inspector in a situation where 
suspected child labour has been found there are guidelines to mak e 
sure that the child’s best interest is secured.  
 
n Violation guideline – To guide the inspector when certain severe 
violations occur.  
 
n Rating system guideline – The guideline outlines what requirements 
need to be fulfilled to earn a certain grade.  
 
n Worker interview guideline – Supports the inspector on how to 
conduct interviews with garment workers. Enclosed with the guidelines 
is a questionnaire covering issues such as discrimination, working 
environment, fire safety, working hours, leaves, wages, child la bour, 
forced labour, discrimination, punishment practices, freedom of 
association, forced labour. The guidelines also give information on 
how to summarise, report, and take action.  
 
 
 
 New Tools  
 
n The role of the Inspector  
 
This guideline includes the responsibility of the inspector , the wider 
organisation in which the inspector is part of, how to organise their work, 
reporting routines and informat ion flow.  
 
n Inspector Kit  
 
This checklist gives information on what documents and other tools that are 
good to bring when doing an inspection.  
 
n Over Time Audit Form  
 
The audit form is a template for conducting over time audits.  
 
n Over Time Audit Guideline  
 
This tool guides the inspector on how to make over time audits. Advices are 
given on where over time is most frequently discovered, how many workers 
should be sampled, how to cross check your information etc.  
 
.  42 NON-COMPLIANCE AND 
ENFORCEMENT  
 
Compliance mechanisms – The Grading System  
Our responsibil ity is to cooperate with our suppliers in  order to improve the 
situation at the factories they own or work with. All over the world, whether 
in Europe, Asia, or Africa, Human Rights and Workers’ Rights are being 
violated or disrespected daily in one way or  the other. Hence, the purpose 
with the grading system is essentially to create a tolerable level where we 
can start to work with the production units. It’s primarily when we place 
orders with them that we have the chance to be truly influential.  
 
This gr ading system is regularly under development in order to put further 
pressure on the production units. One must always bear in mind that our 
suppliers and their production units are companies of different size, 
different company culture, ownership etc and i t is with great difficulty that 
we evaluate these units.  
 
Isolated cases, occasional, or systematic breaches of our code must be 
dealt with in a corresponding fashion.  The Grading System  
 
The grading scale con sists of 5 levels. The five levels are:  
 
Permanently rejected  – A supplier/production unit graded permanently 
rejected can never again do business with H&M.  
 
Rejected  – A production unit graded rejected can do business again with 
H&M if they show clear evi dence of complying with our Code of Conduct on 
all ILO Core Conventions and basic safety standards (i.e. Insufficient level).   
 
Temporary  – A production unit graded temporary can do business with H&M 
for 6 months. Before that time period comes to an end, the production unit 
must be in compliance with the next level of grading system, i.e. Insufficient   
 
Insufficient  – A production unit graded insufficient is complying with our 
Code of Conduct on all ILO Core Conventions and basic safety standards.  
 
Satisf actory  – A production unit graded satisfactory is seemingly complying 
on all aspects of our code.   43 Grading results and sanctions  
n Permanently rejected  
 
In case of repeated child labour , repeated faked documents, repeated us e 
of undeclared units or repeated failure to make agreed corrections, H&M 
will terminate business permanently with the supplier.  
 
n Rejected  
 
We also, due to other severe violations such as minimum wage not paid,  
uncooperative management, unsafe premises, denied access to premises 
etc., grade the suppliers or their subcontractors as Rejected.  
 
Our IT -system supports us  
If a supplier’s production unit is graded Rejected or Permanently rejected, 
our purchase order sy stem obstructs the buyer from placing an order with 
that particular supplier.  
 
 EDUCATING OUR SUPPLY  CHAIN  
 
In order to improve conditions in the factories, knowledge, and awareness 
is of course fundamental. Many of the bad conditions in the factories ar e a 
result of insufficient knowledge among factory management on all levels.   
 
H&M is organizing workshops on different issues such as local legislation, 
safety, labour rights, and human rights. The target groups are managers of 
our suppliers and their su bcontractors.  
 
Internal Workshops  
21 workshops were organized for our suppliers and their subcontractors. 
The majority of workshops were organized by H&M and a few were 
organized by BSR. Around 648 managers and supervisors from our 
suppliers and their sub contractors attended.  
 
INDEPENDENT MONITORI NG 
 
The Dress Code Project  
H&M believes that some kind of independent 8 verification system for our 
internal monitoring program is a necessity in order to be completely 
credible. We have from the start of the Code  of Conduct Monitoring 
Program been supportive of the idea of independent verification.   
 
After 3 years of devoted work, the DressCode Project for Independent 
Monitoring was concluded in 2001. H&M was positive to the conclusion of 
the project. However, du e to circumstances beyond our control, and to our 
disappointment, the results could not be implemented.  
 
                                 8 Independent monitoring is conducted by an inde pendent part (or parties) 
that is in no way attached to the retailer or its supply chain by contract, 
funding or similar. This must not be confused with external monitoring 
where the monitoring is done on commission.  Permanently Rejected  
 
In 2003, we permanently rejected  the business with 10 suppliers. In 
2002, it was 2 suppliers. The increase of 8 suppliers is mainly d ue to 
the raise in repeated use of undeclared units by our suppliers. The 
explanations to the more frequent use of undeclared units or to the 
detection of more undeclared units are quite uncertain.  
  44 Potential production units never inspected before:  
In 20 03, our inspectors graded 19 production units  (2002: 106 units) 
unacceptable/Rejected  for H&M production at their initial inspections  in 
spite of the fact that there were commercial reasons that spoke to the 
advantage of these units. These 19 production u nits were graded 
Unacceptable/Rejected  at both the first inspection and the follow up 
inspection.  
 
Production units previously inspected:  
At the end of the year 2003, 164 production units (2002: 105 units) were 
graded, and remained Unacceptable/Rejected  for H&M production due to 
various code violations.  
 Investigating options on independent monitoring  
Although this particular proposal for independent verification was not 
implemented, H&M continues to su pport the idea. Being predominantly a 
European company with our headquarters in Stockholm, we feel that a 
pan-European initiative would suit us the most. To our knowledge, there is 
not yet an operational organisation for independent verification in Europe,  
but we are closely following the development of the Dutch FWF (Fair Wear 
Foundation).  
 
However, with increasing sales in the USA we have recently also 
established contact with FLA (Fair labour Association). No decision has 
yet been taken to join the FLA f or their monitoring and verification 
program, but we continue a dialogue with them about forms for future co -
operation.  
 VIOLATIONS  
 
Examples of common violations that our inspectors face when doing 
audits:  
 
n Maintenance of safety issues . Many productio n units have, as a 
result of our work, implemented fire exits, fire alarms, fire extinguishers 
etc. However, the procedures to maintain the good safety level are 
lacking.  
 
n Maintenance of cleanliness and sanitary problems .  
 
n Over time  over the legal limit.  
 
n Overtime and leave compensation . Worker’s are too often not  
compensated enough, for worked over time or various leaves.   45 There are numerous ways that management can mislead our inspectors 
consciously or unconsciously. Some examples are:  
 
n Forged ID -cards can mislead factory management and us about a 
person’s age.  
 
n Double record keeping (pay -slips, salary -records, time -cards, log -
books etc.). By keeping double records, the intent by the factory 
management is to mislead the inspector. However, through che cking 
in detail that the information on the time -cards correspond with salary 
records and pay -slips, our inspectors often detect double record 
keeping. The records can also be validated through worker interviews.  
 
 
HUMAN RIGHTS  
 
Forced labour  
The problem  with certain sorts of forced and compulsory labour is that it is 
quite difficult to detect. Through demands on our suppliers, we make it 
clear that any kind of human rights abuse is not acceptable.  
 
Discrimination  
To detect discrimination for gender or o ther reasons in respect of 
employment and remuneration is a challenging task.  
 
Nevertheless, we have made an effort checking if the dismissal of 
pregnant women occurs. In addition, when different ethnic groups are 
present in one workplace, we try to make sure that no group is 
discriminated concerning wages paid. In our internal workshop in 
Shanghai in December 2003, all the inspectors were particularly educated 
on this matter.  
 
Freedom of Association  
The right to Freedom of association and to collective bargaining is 
stipulated in our Code of Conduct. If H&M gets indications of violations of 
this human right, through interviews or other sources, we always take 
immediate action.  n Freedom of Association in Export Processing Zones (EPZ) in 
Bangladesh  
 
Freed om of Association is not permitted in Bangladesh Export Processing 
Zone. Since 1999 we have written to BEPZA (Bangladesh Export 
Processing Zone Authority) http://www.epbbd.com/BanEPZA.html  ) 
requesting the m allow Freedom of Association in the EPZ. We can now 
see actual transformation gradually take place. BEPZA instructs their 
members to implement Workers Welfare Committees (WWC) as a part of 
facilitating the implementation of labour unions. that will be ap proved from 
somewhere in April 2004 according to a decision taken by the government. 
The initial approval of labour unions was decided to come into place from 
January 2004.  
 
Child labour  
Child labour is a problem in the textile producing industry in deve loping 
countries. However, due to very clear communication, unannounced 
inspections, and severe sanctions from H&M and other international 
buyers, child labour is very rarely found in the factories producing for H&M.  
 
If a child is found H&M executes an a ction plan together with the child’s 
family and the supplier in order to get the child back in school. Another 
possibility is vocational training or a combination of both. When seeking a In the meantime  
H&M is encouraging suppliers in the EPZ to make the legally 
require d WWC’s truly operational. In two factories we have taken 
the help of a consultant and a local NGO to achieve this goal. We 
are also requiring new potential suppliers in EPZ’s in Bangladesh to 
verify a number of issues concerning for example:  
 
n Elections to  WWCs

  46 solution for the child, H&M makes sure that the measures taken are in  the 
child’s best interest. This is our primary focus.  
 
H&M demands the supplier to pay both for school and retained salary. 
H&M stays in contact with the supplier, the family, and the school to make 
sure that the child continues his or her education. If there is no follow -up, 
the child may leave the school and take up another job, seeking to earn 
double incomes.  
 
DIALOGUE ABOUT LIVIN G WAGE  
 
In H&M’s Code of Conduct we say that  “The legal minimum wages should 
be a minimum, but not a recommended, level”.  This has been criticized by 
some of our stakeholders who feel that we should instead require that our 
suppliers pay a so -called “living wage”. Although we agree, in principle, 
that people should earn a wage that covers their basic needs, there are 
practic al reasons for not requesting this in our Code, at least not yet.  
 
To start with, we have around 750 suppliers who in their turn use more 
then 2900 production units. The living wage varies in countries and 
regions around the world. It would be difficult t o explain to our suppliers on 
what we base our demand.  
 
Adding to the problem is also that other companies buying from the same 
factory may have a different opinion about what constitutes a living wage. 
The legal minimum wage on the other hand is decided b y the government 
and cannot be disputed by either suppliers or other buyers. We agree with 
our stakeholders that the legal minimum wage in many countries, such as 
Bangladesh, is too low and we would welcome a raise. It should however 
be a government decisi on.  
 
Another possibility is that the wages are negotiated in a collective 
bargaining agreement between the employer and a union representing the 
workers in the factory. It is our understanding that many trade unions 
prefer this model.  
 BURMA  
 
In line with  our commitment to human rights, H&M has a policy of not 
sourcing products manufactured in Burma. This policy will stand until the 
situation in Burma changes. H&M is convinced that human rights issues 
require cooperation and dialogue with many different in terested parties 
around the world. H&M will therefore consult with the Swedish Burma 
Committee as one source of information, before any initiatives of trade 
with or investments in Burma are taken. Thereby we can take into account 
the views of those working  for democracy and respect for human rights in 
Burma when making our decision.  
The Kahatex Sweater case  
 
One of the cases where H&M has been deeply involved to solve a 
serious conflict at a supplier’s factory during 2003 is at Kahatex 
Sweaters in Indonesia. In July of 2003, we were  contacted by WRC 
(Workers Rights Consortium) who informed us that 532 workers 
had been dismissed from the factory after a dispute related to 
organising activities.  
 
Although H&M had rejected the factory for H&M production already 
before the conflict, H&M  immediately contacted the management of 
the factory and demanded that workers should be reemployed. 
Unfortunately, the management did not agree to the demands, but 
H&M has continuously supported the struggle of these workers to 
be reemployed. We have also  put pressure of the top management 
of the P.T Kahatex group to find a solution for the workers.  
 
We have cooperated closely with involved NGO’s both on an 
international and on a local level as well as with other buyers who 
source from the factory.  
 
As of February 2004, more than 200 of the dismissed workers were 
finally offered reemployment with the company that has now 
changed name from Kahatex sweater to P.T. Micro.

PROJECTS  
 
The overtime project in China  
This project, as the name reveals, is trying to improve the situation 
regarding excessive and compulsory overti me. This is a problem in many 
countries, among them China. Impactt, a UK based organisation 
specialising in improving labour standards, has initiated the project, 
designed the methodology and is working in partnership with Chinese 
institutions.  
 
Impactt ha s convened a group of 5 purchasing companies - Debenhams, 
H&M, New Look, Pentland and Sainsbury - to work together to help 
supplier factories find ways of reducing excessive overtime working whilst 
maintaining appropriate wage levels. It is clear that aski ng factories to cut 
overtime, without addressing the causes of long working hours, will reduce 
workers wages and cause workers to leave the factory. The project aims 
to tackle some of the underlying factors which drive high levels of overtime 
by providing technical assistance on productivity, human resource 
management and improving management/labour relations in order to  
reduce the need for long overtime hours, without dramatically cutting  
wages. To read more, access

CONCLUSIONS AT THE HALF -WAY STAGE – Update 2003  
The project is nearing completion. Key findings include:  
n Inverse relation between productivity and hours - when hours 
creep up, pr oductivity falls  
n If hours are cut without productivity increases then wages fall  
n Commitment and capacity of factory management decisive  
n Commitment of purchaser/agent decisive  n Model works best when negotiated by all parties rather than 
imposed  
reworking has reduced significantly in 4 out of 5 factories.  
n productivity has increased by between 23 and 78% in all factories.  
n Hours have been reduced to near or below legal limits in all 
factories. The most successful factories have been able to reduce 
hours by b etween 20% and 37%.  
n Wages have increased in 4 out of 5 factories.  
 
 48 TRAINING AND EDUCATI NG OUR 
EMPLOYEES  
 
Internal communication and education  
During the fall of 2002 and the spring 2003, all shops in 13 out of our 14 
selling countries were educated abo ut our CSR Programs and efforts. 
U.S.A. will be the next selling country to educate its employees. This will 
take place during 2004. The purpose of this education was to build 
reliance and pride among our employees regarding our CSR -efforts and to 
give the m enough information to be able to give our customers a reliable 
answer.  
 
The feedback that we have received from the stores has been very 
positive and we learned that there was a great desire for information on 
the subject.  
 
Another channel for informatio n to our employees is through our internal 
newsmagazine where the work around improving working conditions in our 
supply chain is occasionally brought up.

  51 COMMUNITY INVOLVEMEN T 
 
Vocational training in Bangladesh  
Children in Bangladesh are working for a multi tude of reasons ranging 
from poverty and ignorance, to lack of access to educational opportunities. 
However, it may be noted that a vast majority of the children asserted that 
given the opportunity, they would attend school. Consequently, as a part of 
H&M' s social responsibility program, we are financing development 
projects that are related to our Code of Conduct and the abolition of child 
labour.  
  
Vocational training for young textile workers in Bangladesh is one 
example. The program is intended to train  ex-child labourers who 
previously lost their job due to their low age. The children have been given 
basic education in the so -called MOU -schools (Memorandum Of 
Understanding).  
 
H&M's training project includes a four -month theoretical and three -month 
practical program that leads to guaranteed employment as a machine 
operator at one of H&M's suppliers. H&M pay the students' wages during 
the course as a means of support to their families. The project began in 
spring 1999 and as of today, the 9th batch of stu dents just completed their 
training. Currently around 50 students trains in each class, divided on two 
locations in Dhaka. H&M has engaged highly qualified persons to set up 
the training centre. A consultant who has previously worked in similar 
projects fo r ILO and other UN agencies developed the training program. 
The head of the centre is also highly qualified from previous work with ILO 
and UNDP.  
  
 
 
 
This kind of project makes possible a long -term commitment that enables 
us to develop models for sustain able social development. The need for 
vocational training in Bangladesh is enormous. Garments being the 
country’s leading export, it is important for the future of the country to 
increase the level of skills in the garment industry. In line with our 
expect ations and goals, the educational level for the students, theoretically 
and practically, have improved. In addition, awareness has been raised for 
education among the students’ guardians. The students are not only  
trained to be first grade sewing operators , but are also taught to be 
positive thinkers and socially aware.   52 CHARITY INITIATIVES 2003  
 
Every year our sales organisations are engaged in some kind of charity 
project. Here are some examples from 2003.  
 
n H&M Norway and H&M Denmark continues to suppo rt the Cancer 
Association in Norway. Together they have supported the Breast 
cancer awareness campaign with approximately NOK 350.000 in 
2003.  
 
n H&M Norway also donated NOK 100.000 to Save the Children’s TV -
gala. This year the money was allocated to educati on for children who 
suffer from war, are disabled or lives under extreme poverty.  
 
n H&M U.S.A partnered with Save the Children, for our U.S. storewide 
“Creative Kids Make a Fashion Statement” charity drive. Save the 
Children is a national not -for-profit chi ld-assistance organization 
committed to making lasting positive changes in the lives of children in 
need. The winning children’s design was printed onto a T -shirt, sold in 
all H&M U.S. stores (with children’s departments) with the entire 
purchase price ($5 ,50) of each T -shirt directly benefited Save the 
Children.  
 
n H&M Austria gave vouchers and garments for a value of Euro 10.000 
to SOS Kinderdorf, which is a social institution for kids without parents.  
 
n H&M England has for the second consecutive year suppor ted the Pink 
Ribbon Appeal for Breast Cancer. H&M stocks pink ribbons within all 
UK stores for customers to wear. Customers donate £1 or more for 
each ribbon. In 2002 and 2003, £14051 was raised. H&M England 
also supports FTBC (Fashion Targets Breast Cance r) through various 
activities and contributions.  
 Rural development project in Delhi  
In rural parts of India, there are villages that remain completely 
outside of modern society. They have no e lectricity, sewerage, 
health care, medical treatment, government schools, etc. Women 
are often particularly vulnerable in such villages. For cultural and 
religious reasons, girls are not allowed to travel to the nearest 
town to go to school. The women of t he village often supplement 
the family income with some kind of home working, which 
frequently means that older daughters have to take care of the 
children and housework rather than going to school if there is a 
school at all.  
 
A UNDP study supported by H& M was conducted by three local 
NGOs (contracted by UNDP) in 1999 -2000 in 20 villages. The 
study recommended a community development project for 
poverty alleviation in 6 out of these villages. The village project 
was initiated in January 2001.  
 
H&M is now f inancing this project in northern India, which aims to 
improve conditions for women in selected villages around New 
Delhi.  The project organizes education in health matters, 
woman’s rights, and the consequences of child labour as well as 
investing in loca l teaching facilities and providing older children 
with computer training. Another challenge of this project is to 
create a model, that protects the rights of women and children, 
which can be applied to other villages under the same conditions.  
 
As a resul t of the project, the women have now started to market 
their own products at bazaars all over India. They have also 
started local savings groups to handle their earnings and the 
project is now being expanded to include women in other 
villages.  
 
  53 PRODUCT RESPONSIBILI TY 
 
Our Quality is secured through our Production offices in 
Europe and Asia  
Quality is an integral part of the business idea at H&M. Our ambitions is to 
make sure that all customers a lways can be both safe and satisfied 
regarding the quality of all goods in our shops. Our customers’ 
expectations are leading our everyday work.   
 
To fulfil this ambition, our quality work is secured through our 21 
production offices and their local quali ty organisation that consists of lab 
technicians and quality inspectors. Each office has a well -equipped lab 
that work according to H&M standardized working methods monitored 
from the Quality Department in Stockholm.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Our wor k with quality is organised within the following 
sections:  
 
Quality standards and testing  
This section focuses on developing and implementing requirements 
for our physical and chemical tests in accordance with the most 
strict legislations and standards ava ilable in our selling countries.  
 
Technical  
This section centre their attention to issues related to fit, sizes and 
technical making on garments. Also in process is the involvement in 
a body measurement study and a size project that will lead to a 
common size system in Europe.  
 
Product control  
This section engages in issues regarding quality control by 
standardising the working methods of each H&M production office. 
Consumer Product Safety and Children Safety issues are other 
focuses for this section. Much  attention is also centred on the 
implementation of a guideline for Production and Quality Control 
with our suppliers, through which we take further control of quality.  
  54 CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY 
 
Quality controls  
H&M sets high quality requirements. At the buying office in Stockholm 
there are about 20 people supporting the production offices in quality 
related issues. They are textile engineers, chemists, designers, and all 
experienced. To ensur e the quality of all products at the production stage, 
we have 115 quality controllers employed in the production offices who 
regularly go to the factories to control and correct any quality problems in 
the course of production. They also, most often, carr y out a final inspection 
before the goods are shipped. H&M uses the AQL 9-system 2.5 to decide 
whether the quality level is acceptable for shipment.  
 
H&M require of all suppliers to have a built -in quality control system in 
each factory. This system, called  GPQ (Guidelines for Production and 
Quality Control), is coordinated with the system the 115 H&M Quality 
Controllers use when checking the production. The main purpose is to 
detect any quality problems as early as possible in the production and to 
correct them. The goods are controlled at several stages during production 
including packing stage.  
 
                                 9 AQL=  Acceptable Quality Level  How garments are quality controlled  
In order to ensure that garments are of high qua lity, H&M 
quality controllers visit suppliers during production.  
 
1. Start -up meeting  
 
Frequently we meet the supplier prior to production to go 
through the garment in order to identify any technical 
difficulties that may occur.  
 
2. Inspection  
 
Our control lers must carry out inspections as early as 
possible during production in order to avoid mistakes 
being made. These inspections include checking 
measurements. The controllers have a size chart to help 
them and the suppliers must have a sample against 
which  they can compare their products to make sure 
they are exactly what H&M has ordered. The quality 
controllers can carry out several inspections during 
production. As well as the measurements, they look at 
how the garments have been made. Are the stitches th e 
right length? Is the thread the right colour and quality? 
The controllers use an inspection manual in which H&M 
specifies the things they have to check.  
 
3. Final inspection  
 
During the final inspection, the controllers check to see if 
the garments have been well sewn, well pressed and are 
produced according to the approved sample and other 
requirements. They also check that the price tags and 
labels are correct. The controllers measure three 
garments in each size to make sure they correspond 
correctly. A  number of garments are always checked, 
depending on the size of the order.  
 
  55 Quality testing  
Samples of every product in H&M’s collections undergo a number of 
quality and safety tests. Yearly, several hundred thousand tests are 
carried out , mainly at our 17 Production Office labs, but also at some 
external laboratories. Garments are washed and measured to check that 
they do not shrink or twist and to check their colourfastness and dry 
rubbing. In addition, we test salt and chlorine bleachin g, pilling and seam 
strength. Durability tests are carried out on details such as zippers and 
press -button. Flammability tests are performed to check that the garment 
is not easily flammable. Final quality control takes place at our distribution 
centres be fore the garments are distributed to the stores.  
 
Children’s safety  
Children's clothes must meet particularly high safety requirements. It is our 
constant goal to have baby’s - and children’s wear designed and made with 
safety in mind. All suppliers of bab y and children garments must sign 
H&M’s Safety Requirements for Baby’s - and Children’s wear. There are no 
international standards for Children Safety yet, but during 2004 there will 
come a European standard concerning cords and drawstrings on 
children’s cl othing.  
 
Some countries have national standards, whereas we at H&M always 
follow the one of our selling countries that has the strictest safety 
regulations.  
 
At every production office there is a person responsible for children’s 
safety. A majority of de signers, buyers, and staff at our production offices 
have been educated in issues concerning children’s safety. New 
employees are also getting this training. Every supplier of children’s and 
baby garments must receive a special children’s safety training i n order to 
qualify as a supplier for children’s garments.  
 
Furthermore, on the request of SIS (Swedish Standards Institute) and BSI 
(The British Standards Institution) H&M participates in the work to 
establish safety standards for baby and children’s garm ents. This work is 
organized by CEN – The European Committee for Standardization.  
 
Some examples of H&M’s children safety requirements that illustrate our 
dedication:   
n H&M pays extra attention to hoods and drawstrings in order to avoid 
situations where th e construction of the garment increases the risk for 
entrapment or suffocation. Buttons and snap buttons must be securely 
fastened.  
n The supplier must make sure that no details on the garments have 
sharp edges or sharp points  
n All sewn on buttons, press butt ons, ribbons, etc. are tested according 
to the standard for small parts and must also be securely fastened to 
withstand normal wear and wash.  
n H&M is trying to avoid too many details and decorations on Baby and 
Children garments to prevent them from being a  safety risk.  
n Before packed and exported all Baby and Children garments are going 
through a needle detector machine, which detects any small fragment 
of metal such as broken needles.  
 
 
We should underline that H&M reserves the right to cancel the order or,  if 
already delivered, return the goods if any of the conditions in H&M’s safety 
requirements for children’s and baby wear will fail in a test according to 
mentioned standard for small parts.  
 
H&M also holds the supplier responsible for any consequences ca used by 
products that do not meet our requirements.  
  56 Care Label instructions  
As in all our work with quality, also our work on labelling is strongly 
customer orientated.  
 
Four keywords guide our internal work  with care instructions:  
 
Simple  – Should cont ain no unnecessary information  
 
Accurate  – Should hold only relevant information  
 
Tough  – The aim is that the garments are marked with as high 
temperature as possible. We will only have satisfied customers if the 
garments are clean after wash.  
 
Consumer fr iendly  – It must be easy to wash all H&M clothes together, 
whether men’s, ladies or children’s’.  
 
Since autumn 2002, in correspondence with American regulation, all 
garments are labelled with country of origin information. However, no 
matter where the garm ents are produced, our quality requirements are the 
same. Furthermore, our long -term goal is that wearing and caring of our 
garments should be simple and comfortable in the everyday life of all our 
customers.  
 
On children’s wear, our goal is that all gar ments should be washable in 60 
degrees as well as suitable for tumble -drying. Today the majority of them 
are washable in 60 degrees. In addition, the vast majority of H&M clothing 
can be machine -washed and does not have to be dry -cleaned.  
 
 
Chemical restri ctions  
H&M has, with the concern for the health of our customers as well as for 
the environment and the working conditions in the factories where our products are made, established Chemical Restrictions for textile, leather, 
plastic and metal products.  
 
H&M's suppliers contractually guarantee not to use certain chemicals in 
production. These chemicals are, or could be hazardous to health and 
environment. Particular consideration is given to substances that could 
cause skin irritation or allergies or that m ay be carcinogenic.  
 
The precautionary principle is guiding our work when restricting chemicals. 
The restrictions therefore include both chemicals restricted by law, and 
chemicals we have chosen to include for precautionary reasons. As an 
important part o f H&M’s long -term work against allergies, we are 
participating in work aimed at establishing reliable standards for testing 
allergenic substances (see more information in the box).  
 
We require compliance with these restrictions from all our suppliers, and  
all suppliers must sign the Chemical Restrictions Compliance Commitment 
and/or Restrictions for Cosmetic and Hygiene Products. In this way we 
also contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the production 
stage, as well as in the incineration and recycling of worn -out clothing.  
 
Tests are performed to check that the banned chemicals are not present in 
the garments. Nickel, AZO and Formaldehyde are some of the most  
commonly tested.  
We have estimated that approximately 22,000 chemical related tests were 
performed during 2003. In addition, the nickel release is checked in 
jewellery and metal details in contact with the skin. Samples from every 
order are tested.  
 H&M cooperate comprehensively with Swedish Standards Institute 
(SIS) on analytical methods for allergens  
Allergens are limit by EU and national regulations such as the Nickel 
Directive, Cosmetics Directive etc. Standardised analytical methods are 
often lacking for control of compliance with regulations. Common 
analytical methods would support existing and future European 
legislation.  
 
H&M participates on several meetings yearly.  In addition, we 
contributed with SEK 100.000 during 2001 -2002 to move the work 
forward.  
  57 Our chemical restrictions are continuously updated, with new substances 
being added on a r egular basis.  
 
In 2001 H&M entered into cooperation, through BSR, with a number of 
companies, to establish common restrictions. These restrictions are now 
finalized and can be viewed as an industry standard and a minimum level. 
The list is predominantly based on worldwide legislation 10 and 
regulations, while also maintaining a perspective on legislative trends and  
stakeholder concerns which is indicated by the fact that H&M has gone 
further than the agreed restrictions stipulates. The restrictions are appl ied 
to the various products in our product range according to relevance and 
risk. The limits and test methods are also defined as per tested material, 
legislation, technical feasibility etc.  
 
n Our list of restricted chemicals is found under a drop down menu  at 
www.hm.com/csr   
 
Implementation of Chemical Restrictions  
We support our suppliers with information on how to implement and 
comply with our Chemical restrictions.  
The suppliers also get information on how to locat e and solve the problem 
if they infringe our restrictions.  
 
Co-operations  
A proactive work in the areas of quality, health and safety is essential and 
given a high priority within H&M. Nevertheless, in order to stay ahead in 
this area, a close co -operation  and exchange with relevant authorities is 
crucial. Our co -operation and knowledge exchange with the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the National Chemicals 
Inspectorate in Sweden, the Swedish Consumer Agency, and other similar 
organisations  help us to become a leader in the field.  
                                 10 If law in one of our sales countries restricts a chemical, we 
always follow the same restriction for all our sales countries.  
 Recall Management  
In spite of well -organized work with various quality aspects, garments do 
end up in our stores that are not up to mark. In such cases, our recall 
management system is of utmost importance in order  to secure a fast and 
professional recall of a particular item from our stores.  
 
 
 
 Update of Chemical Restrictions 2003  
The chemicals currently included in our chemical restrictions are listed 
as an attachment . The list was latest updated for the 6th time during

Animal rights Policy  
Animals should be fairly treated. When documented unfair treatment of 
animals has been brought to our attention, we have made d ecisions that 
minimize the risk for H&M to be complicit to the mistreatment.  
 
H&M does only accept leather and fur from animals that were bred for 
meat -production. H&M does not accept any leather production in India due 
to the alleged bad conditions in wh ich the animals are transported.  
 
Other product related policies  
n For products made of tropical wood H&M requires a certificate from 
FSC, Forest Stewardship Council.  
 
n H&M’s suppliers must guarantee that material used for H&Ms products 
does not contain en dangered species in any form.   
 
Routines for ensuring that policies are being respected  
For all products covered by our policies on leather, fur, or any endangered 
species, H&M requires the supplier to send a written confirmation, 
specifying origin of mate rial, correct name and breed.  
 
Animal testing  
H&M does not allow animal testing on cosmetic and hygiene products, 
either during production or on the finished products. All the ingredients 
used in H&M’s products are approved in accordance with the high 
requirements set by the appropriate authorities and by H&M itself. 
Products are always assessed for their safety and quality. H&M has had a 
policy on animal testing since mid 1990’s. This policy forms part of H&M’s 
restrictions for cosmetic and hygiene  produ cts11. All suppliers of H&M’s 
own cosmetic and hygiene products have to abide by these restrictions. 
The supplier also has a duty to inform his subcontractors of H&M’s 
restrictions and ensure that they abide by them.

Cosmetic and Hygiene Products.  
 Follow legislation through ECO -TRACK  
Our concerns about ecological and human health impacts 
resulting from certain substa nces require us to be updated on the 
stringent legislation that exist in many of our selling countries. 
The need to ensure effective compliance is a crucial and 
continuing process for manufacturers and hence for H&M as a 
buyer.  
 
ECO -TRACK provides valuabl e and up -to-date information on 
relevant legislation – existing and forthcoming – that may affect 
our products.  
  59 COMMUNICATIONS  
 
The purpose of H&M’s communication is to build the brand in the longer 
term. Much of H&M’s credibility is based on the way we communicate with 
the world around us. Both internal and external communications must 
therefore be characterised by an open attitude with clear messages , 
objectivity, accessibility and sensitivity. H&M communicate and convey the 
brand via a number of different channels. The main forum for 
communication is via our stores. Our methods of communicating include 
the media, advertising in magazines, on televisi on, billboards and the 
Internet.  
 
MARKETING  
 
Values are in the eyes of the beholder  
H&M communicate the business idea - fashion and quality at the best 
price - through a large number of advertising campaigns. The 
advertisements are largely the same in al l markets and are a way of 
inviting customers into our stores. Commercial pictures are often subject to 
one’s taste. The interpretation is in the eye of the beholder and it is of 
enormous difficulty to satisfy contradicting opinions. Through customer 
surve ys in all our markets, we know that the vast majority of our customers 
appreciate our marketing and that it creates positive brand values.  
 
Choosing the right model  
H&M must not only have the right timing in terms of the collections but it is 
fundamental f or us to have the right timing regarding the choice of model 
and illustrative language.  
 
Fashion changes continuously and our campaigns strive to follow the 
trends in the society as a whole, which calls for different models for 
different campaigns. Howeve r, when trends are revolving towards unhealthiness, we actively chose 
not to follow such trend in our 
communication.  
 
The choice of the model is of 
course important because the 
model is showing our fashion. 
The models personality and 
character must convey the 
fashion we show and inspire and 
interest our customers.  
 
Our models are chosen in 
cooperation with internationally 
recognized model agencies and 
our own representatives. The 
models portrayed in our ads 
should be healthy and 
wholesome. H&M actively cho se not to contract too young or too thin 
models or models suffering from eating disorders or drug or alcohol abuse.  
 
Representatives from H&M are always present at commercial photo 
shootings to secure that H&M’s demands are met.  
 
The reason why we use pro fessional models is that they are accustomed 
to act in front of a camera and are therefore able to easier clarify our 
fashion to the customer.  
 H&M Product Policy  
 
Kids wear: H&M’s children’s 
clothes must be comfortable and 
practical. We do not make clothes 
that may be perceived as 
provocative on small children.  
 
War-inspired garments: H&M 
has decided not to use camouflage 
patterns on our garments.  
 
Offensive patterns: Prints on tops 
and other garments must not be 
offensive, racist, sexist, political or 
religious.  
  60 The marketing team at H&M are mainly women  
H&M’s marketing team is well experienced in terms of ethical dilem mas. 
Ethical issues are discussed regularly and to show our sincerity we have 
chosen, some years ago, to adopt the International Chamber of 
Commerce’s basic rules on advertising. The majority of our marketing is 
aimed towards women and the fact that our ma rketing team mainly consist 
of women make us comfortable and convinced that our advertisements 
also appeals to women.  
 
Handling feedback  
H&M is sometimes criticized in the way our campaigns have been 
designed. The critique is most often directed towards t he choice of model 
but can also be linked to looks, poses, the choice of garments, the 
surrounding environment or the pure feeling that is conveyed through the 
pictures. H&M listens to positive and negative feedback and whatever 
feels relevant we bring wit h us to the next marketing campaign. When the 
choice of model is debated we are keen on emphasizing that it is primarily 
the present fashion that guides us in the choice of model.  
 
Sometimes H&M’s campaigns are reported to national ethical councils. We 
approve of this since it means an objective review based on legal or 
ethical standards.  
 
n No underwear or swimsuit campaign has ever been found to be in 
breach of any law or ethical standard. Nor has any kind of Men, 
Women, or Youth campaign been in breach of  any law or ethical 
standard. 12 
 
n In 1997, pictures in one of our children clothes catalogues were found 
“conserving old gender roles and hence insulting both to men and 
women”13. The pictures showed boys doing traditionally men’s work 
and girls doing tradit ionally women’s work. Because of these pictures 
and the corresponding text, the council felt that the boys were 
                                 12 To the best of our knowledge  13 Confederation of (Swedish) enterprises’ ethical council against gender 
discriminating advertisement.  
 portrayed as they had power to act, were performance oriented, and 
showed good confidence. The girls were, on the contrary, portrayed as 
less ca pable, helpless and with bad confidence. Subsequently, the 
catalogue was found in breach of ICC’s basic rules on advertising. 
H&M responded to this saying that we share the value of gender 
equality and that H&M’s business idea is fundamentally fair and 
humanistic. It was not H&M’s intent to convey a message in our 
catalogue that is perceived as humiliating. Since  then, no other of our 
children clothes catalogues has been found in breach of these rules.  
 
 Advertising policy  
Every year, we communicate H&M’s business concept, “fashion and quality at the best price” through 
different advertising campaigns throughout Europe and parts of North America. Our advertising is clear 
and simple and aims to inform our customers about H&M’s  new products while representing who we are 
and what we stand for. We present the latest fashion and the price of the garment.  
 
Our advertisements are produced centrally in Sweden by H&M’s marketing department in cooperation 
with internal and independent c reators. Our advertising is in large part identical in all of H&M’s markets, 
but the medium used varies according to local needs and necessities. We have opted to follow the 
International Chamber of Commerce’s basic rules for advertisement.  
 
Our marketing is very influential. It is therefore essential for us to convey a positive, healthy image. 
H&M’s advertising photos do not aim to convey a specific ideal. We portray different characterizations 
and a mix of different looks and styles for our variety of con cepts for women, men, teenagers, and 
children. H&M deliberately distances itself from drug and alcohol abuse and actively chose not to follow 
unhealthy trends in our communication.  
 
The models portrayed in our advertisements should be healthy and wholesome . Our models are chosen 
in cooperation with internationally recognized modelling agencies and our own representatives. The 
reason why we use professional models is that they are accustomed to working in front of a camera and 
are therefore able to do justic e to our garments. By working with professional models, photographers and 
stylists, we communicate our fashion and quality in a clear and inspiring manner. We have special 
guidelines when it comes to advertising our “kids” concept. Our target group is pare nts, not children. This 
means that we place our advertisements in media that are not directly focused on children. We are 
careful to make sure that the children appearing in our advertisements choose freely to participate. A 
representative from H&M is alwa ys present during child photo sessions to ensure the seriousness of the 
session and the children’s safety. We market clothing for both boys and girls in different age groups. We 
reflect diversity in society by using children from different cultural backgro unds.  
 
H&M follows the International Chamber of Commerce’s basic rules on advertising.
