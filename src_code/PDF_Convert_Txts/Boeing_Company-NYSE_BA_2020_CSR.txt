LEADERSHIP MESSAGE
We know our continued 
commitment to environmental 
sustainability—whether we’re 
efficiently managing resources 
or cutting the carbon footprint of 
our products—is a key element 
to the company’s overall strategy. 
Innovation is part of Boeing’s 
DNA, and you will see how we 
apply that to the environment 
in this report. We are designing 
and building our products while 
being mindful of emissions and 
conserving precious resources, 
including energy and water, while 
significantly reducing waste. 
We do this because it’s the 
right thing to do and because 
it will sustain our business and 
our communities in the years to come. Perhaps most importantly, 
environmental sustainability is 
critical to future generations—
both to enable us to attract top 
talent and because we need to 
leave the Earth in a good place 
for those who will follow us.
We are committed to continuing 
on this trajectory, even as 
the world grapples with the 
coronavirus pandemic and social 
justice. In fact, there are many 
valuable lessons to apply from 
our current situation, namely 
that responsible actions benefit 
everyone on the planet.

The cover story of the new 777X 
demonstrates that Boeing’s environmental performance is closely linked to innovation and technology ( See page 6 ). 
Each newly developed Boeing product is typically 15% to 25% more efficient than the airplanes they replace. Read more about Boeing’s industry-leading fuel efficient product offerings, enabling the industry to achieve a global approach to carbon-neutral growth starting in 2020 and a 50% reduction by 2050 ( See 
pages 37–40 to learn more about Boeing’s collaborative efforts to reduce carbon emissions ). 
Our new airplanes exceed those industry standards. Our commitment to environmental sustainability doesn’t stop there. In fact, Boeing’s product designs enable disassembly of parts and materials recovery resulting in airplanes that are nearly 90% recyclable by weight for parts reuse and scrap. Read about how Boeing works directly with airline customers to ensure airplanes are operated as efficiently as possible through Boeing Global Services (see page 26 ). 
Operations
Boeing has bold goals to reduce 
companywide greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. Read about our 2019 progress on page 41. In 2019, Boeing made strides in securing more renewable energy to power its operations, building on our strong track record. Two Boeing factories are powered by 100% renewable energy, and about half of Boeing’s total electricity consumption comes from carbon-free hydroelectric and other renewable energy sources. Since 2007, Boeing has reduced its emissions by 29% ( See analysis on page 
40). Read about how additive 
manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is changing the way 
we design and build products 
with fewer raw materials, creating 
less waste and improving fuel 
efficiency in our products ( See 
story on page 30 ).

BOEING’S APPROACH 
TO ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITYTABLE OF CONTENTSBoeing airplanes bring the 
world closer together. We’re 
taking critical steps to design 
and build products with air 
quality in mind by reducing 
emissions, decreasing 
fuel use, promoting 
sustainable aviation fuel, 
and increasing the use of 
renewable electricity in our 
manufacturing facilities.air
AIR | 5TABLE OF CONTENTSAIR | 6The 777X is Boeing’s newest 
family of twin-aisle airplanes, 
the largest and most fuel 
efficient jet of its kind. With an 
optimized wingspan of more 
than 72 meters—longer than 
today’s 777—and a simple 
folding wingtip, the 777X delivers 
greater efficiency, significant fuel 
savings and complete airport 
compatibility.
Smart design and innovative 
new technologies on the 777X, 
including its fourth-generation 
carbon-fiber composite wing, all-
new engines and natural laminar flow nacelles, together will help 
the airplane to achieve 10% 
lower fuel use and emissions and 
10% lower operating costs to 
comparable aircraft in the market.  
Boeing has partnered with 
GE, which has developed the 
most advanced, fuel-efficient 
commercial engine ever, the 
GE9X. The GE9X engine will be 
more than 5% more efficient than 
anything in its class.

JETS HOME ON BIOFUEL Boeing began offering airline 
customers the option to fly 
their new airplanes home on 
sustainable fuel in March 2019. 
Alaska Airlines joined Boeing to 
launch the program with EPIC 
Aviation and World Energy. 
The program is part of wide-
ranging efforts by Boeing and 
the industry to reduce CO 2 
emissions from flying and helps 
signal demand for sustainable 
fuel to suppliers. Boeing 
has partnered with airlines 
on sustainable aviation fuel 
delivery flights since 2012 when 
Etihad Airways took delivery 
of a 777-300ER. This new 
program builds on sustainable 
fuel logistics developed for the 
ecoDemonstrator Program and 
makes sustainable fuel available 
to more airline customers.EYGYPTAIR, Etihad Airways and 
SAUDIA have used sustainable 
fuel on delivery flights under 
this new program. Several other 
airlines have also expressed 
interest.
The program is available at all  
three of Boeing’s delivery centers 
in Washington and South 
Carolina.
Scientific studies have found that 
sustainable fuel reduces CO 2 
emissions by up to 80% over the 
fuel’s life cycle, depending on the 
source used to make it.
TABLE OF CONTENTSAIR | 8Removing paint from an aircraft 
usually involves a lot of hard 
work with a sander or chemical 
process, neither of which are 
easy on the people doing the 
work—nor the environment. 
Boeing is developing innovative 
ways to remove paint from 
airplanes that use lasers to 
improve the quality and speed 
of the work while also reducing 
waste and the ergonomic risk  
to employees.With laser ablation, the paint 
absorbs laser light, which excites 
the molecules into the plasma 
state and vaporizes the material. 
Laser de-painting reduces more 
than 90% of hazardous waste 
generated by other paint removal 
methods. REMOVING PAINT AT THE

TABLE OF CONTENTSAIR | 9Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator 
Program takes promising 
technologies out of the lab and 
tests them in the air to accelerate 
innovation.
A technology tested in 2019 
makes parts change shape or 
move based on the temperature. 
The project involved vortex 
generators—small fins on 
airplane wings that improve 
airflow during takeoff and landing.But the fins aren’t required during 
cruise and therefore create drag. 
Shape memory alloy raises the 
fins near the ground and retracts 
them at higher altitudes where 
the air is colder.
An airline flying 100 jets equipped 
with these fins could save up to  
3 million gallons of fuel a year— 
the equivalent of taking about 
3,800 cars off the road.REDUCING FUEL USE

ENGINEERS DESIGN WITH 
ENVIRONMENT IN MINDMost passengers who board 
a plane wouldn’t notice, but 
Boeing’s materials and process 
engineers are keenly aware that 
their innovation in finding the 
most environmentally progressive 
matter and methods to build 
airplanes is making air travel 
cleaner than ever. Here are some 
highlights:
•  Lasers are beginning to replace 
sanders and chemicals in 
Boeing factories to remove 
paint from aircraft, clean 
tools, and prepare surfaces 
for painting, improving quality 
and accuracy while reducing 
hazardous waste by 90%.•  Boeing is also studying 
experimental concepts that 
pull carbon dioxide out of 
the atmosphere and use it to 
produce high value chemicals 
and materials. 
•  Working with suppliers and the 
FAA, Boeing is working to find 
safe and reliable replacements 
for Halon fire suppressants, 
because of damage the 
compound can cause to 
the ozone layer. Boeing has 
completed critical fire tests 
for a new cargo suppression 
agent and continues to 
evaluate its performance on 
the ecoDemonstrator in-flight 
laboratory.  TABLE OF CONTENTSAIR | 11BOEING AND ELG CREATE 
CARBON-FIBER RECYCLING 
MODEL A year after launching a 
partnership with UK-based ELG 
Carbon Fibre to recycle excess 
aerospace-grade carbon fiber 
composite materials, Boeing 
was recognized by the National 
Association of Manufacturers 
for sustainability leadership, 
establishing a model for other 
manufacturers. 
Boeing will implement carbon-
fiber recycling at 11 sites across 
the globe, with most excess  
fiber coming from Australia, 
Puget Sound region in the state 
of Washington and Salt Lake  
City manufacturing sites. The 
program will divert more than  1 million pounds (453,000 kilo-  
grams) of solid waste to landfill 
each year and generate revenue 
by selling the excess, which 
is transformed into laptop 
cases, car parts and railcar 
undercarriages.
ELG’s proprietary process shreds 
these excess materials and takes 
them through a modified pyrolysis 
process that vaporizes the resin  
holding the carbon fiber layers  
together. This leaves behind clean  
discontinuous carbon fiber material  
to be used for new products. 
This partnership will help Boeing 
reduce solid waste sent to 
landfills 20% by 2025.
Boeing's carbon fiber recycling  
program is a model of creating  
environmental sustainability that  
is commercially viable.TABLE OF CONTENTSAIR | 12HERE COMES THE SUN…
AND WIND The sun, wind and water are 
increasingly displacing fossil 
fuels as the sources of energy 
powering Boeing operations. 
In early 2020, Boeing joined 
the Renewable Energy Buyers 
Alliance, a community of large 
energy buyers accelerating a 
zero-carbon energy future.
By working closely with energy 
producers and suppliers, the 
alliance helps large energy 
consumers such as Boeing find  
a viable pathway to procuring 
more clean energy.Boeing buys renewables to 
power its factories in Renton, 
Wash. and Charleston, S.C., and 
a large data center in Arizona, 
with clean 100% renewable 
electricity. 
Boeing is also buying renewable 
energy credits for Portland and 
six other sites in Puget Sound 
for a total reduction of 136,000 
metric tons of greenhouse gas 
across the enterprise.
Boeing is committed to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions in its 
operations by 25% by 2025.
TABLE OF CONTENTSAIR | 13Spectrolab, a Boeing subsidiary 
based in Sylmar, Calif., which 
produces space-based solar 
panels, is thinking creatively 
by reusing waste from solar 
cell manufacturing heat, in its 
factory. This innovation allows 
them to turn off their boilers in 
the summer and run them much 
lower in the winter by recycling 
waste heat from their process 
into the boiler-heating loop. By 
reusing waste heat, Spectrolab is 
able to reduce the use of natural 
gas, reducing cost and related 
carbon emissions. Specifically, Spectrolab captures 
waste heat from an emissions-
control unit—a regenerative 
thermal oxidizer—to heat parts 
of its facility. By using modern 
controls, an innovative heat 
exchanger design and good 
old-fashioned plumbing, waste 
exhaust heat is used to heat the 
plant hot water loop system.
Spectrolab started doing 
the math and worked on the 
engineering. The team found a 
safe and relatively inexpensive 
solution. They came up with the 
design criteria, fabricated it and 
installed it on their own. ENERGY EFFICIENCY  
DRIVES COMPETITIVENESS 
AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION
Boeing earned the ENERGY 
STAR Partner of the Year Award 
for Sustained Excellence for the 
10th consecutive year from the 
U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency in recognition of the 
company’s sustained leadership 
in energy management. 
The 2020 award is based 
on conservation efforts by 
Boeing employees. Boeing’s 
annual employee competition 
to reduce waste, called Battle 
of the Buildings ( see full story 
on page 25 ), exemplifies these 
efforts. Boeing went further 
and created a toolkit for solid 
waste reduction—52 Boeing 
sites competed in six countries, 
diverting 175 tons from landfills 
(or waste to energy), within  
a month. 
At the end of 2019, Boeing 
launched a renewable energy 
procurement strategy that was 
noted as among the most robust 
of all ENERGY STAR industrial 
partners. Boeing’s 2020 strategic 
actions will be operational in 2021 
or 2022, to reduce the company’s 
direct greenhouse gas emissions.

have a place at work to charge 
their electric vehicles due to 
Boeing’s relationship with 
Chargepoint, the largest electric 
vehicle charging network in 
North America. Employees 
in nine states, Washington, 
Oregon, California, Arizona, 
Missouri, Illinois, Florida, Texas 
and Pennsylvania, benefit from 
the Chargepoint network. All 50 states have access to EV 
charging stations. This program 
has the potential to avoid 
greenhouse gas production 
from stations at Boeing sites by

a way to combine these  
merits, Boeing is helping to 
reduce pollution flowing into 
Puget Sound.
The Aurora Bridge (officially the 
George Washington Memorial

Salmon Safe to design a bioswale,  
which is green infrastructure that 
removes pollution out of surface 
runoff water to improve salmon 
habitat. The green infrastructure 
installed will capture 400,000 
gallons (1.5 million liters) of 
stormwater runoff when the 
project is complete.

airplane parts. Retired airplanes 
can provide recycled parts 
for in-service aircraft, helping 
customers reduce the cost 
of repairs while offering cost-
efficient quality solutions. BGS 
provides access to this inventory, 
called the Used Serviceable 
Material (USM) capability.
Boeing entered the USM 
business to support the 
increasing demand for parts  
at reduced prices, enable  
quick inventory access, and 
provide more life-cycle value  
to customers.Boeing recertifies parts ensuring 
quality. Parts are acquired 
through the dismantling or 
“teardown” of out-of-service 
planes. Boeing has harvested 
materials from retired 777, 767 
and 737 airplanes, as well as 
non-Boeing manufactured 
aircraft. Boeing is a founding 
member of the Aircraft Fleet 
Recycling Association, the 
leading global organization

TABLE OF CONTENTSLAND |  30Additive manufacturing, also 
known as 3D printing, is changing 
the way Boeing designs and 
builds aerospace products— 
allowing the company to use less 
raw materials, create less waste 
and improve fuel efficiency in  
its products.
Additive manufacturing is the 
process of building structural 
components micro-layer by 
micro-layer from 3D model 
data, as opposed to subtractive 
manufacturing which removes 
material to create parts. It 
enables highly innovative designs 
that add functionality, reduce weight, consolidate many parts 
into one, and create parts that 
are too complex for traditional 
manufacturing.
Metal additive manufactured 
parts are now standard on many 
of Boeing satellites. For example, 
the engine mount component 
was first introduced in September 
2018. The component produced 
by additive manufacturing 
weighs 28 pounds less than 
the traditionally manufactured 
counterpart, using less of the 
Earth’s resources and producing 
less scrap in the fabrication 
process.ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING

In 2019, all airlines worldwide 
flying international routes began 
formal monitoring and reporting 
of their emissions as part of 
the historic Carbon Offset 
and Reduction Scheme for 
International Aviation (CORSIA), 
adopted by the United Nations’ 
International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) in 2016. 
CORSIA will help aviation meet  
its commitment for carbon neutral 
growth from 2020. Commercial Aviation  
and Climate Change 
Aviation accounts for 
approximately 2% of global CO 2 
emissions, according to the 
U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change. Global 
agreements reached in 2016 
support achieving the industry-
established goals and a global 
sectoral approach to controlling 
emissions: 
•  A fuel-efficiency performance 
commitment for aircraft 
•  A global market-based measure 
system, CORSIA 
Implementation of these 
agreements into regulatory 
frameworks around the world  
is underway. 
Customer Requirements 
The aviation industry’s business 
goal of providing safe, cost-
efficient travel and environmental 
goal of reducing CO 2 emissions 
are both achieved by constantly 
improving airplane fuel efficiency. 
Reducing emissions is aligned to

Boeing recognizes that pollution, 
natural resource scarcity and 
climate change are serious issues 
that require credible actions and 
global solutions. The United Nations estimates 
that the world’s population hit

another 83 million people every 
year. By 2030, the population will 
reach 8.6 billion and increase to 
nearly 10 billion people by 2050. 
A growing population and 
urbanization will further boost 
global demand for transportation, 
with the industry being 
challenged to meet the demand 
without a corresponding growth 
of emissions, community noise 
or other potentially harmful 
environmental effects.

exceeded this goal, with an average 2.1% improvement per year. 
Boeing’s highly efficient airplanes, including the 787 Dreamliner 
family that reduces fuel use by 20% to 25% compared to the 
models it replaces, helped enable this success. Airline operational 
efficiency also contributed significantly through greater seating 
utilization, fuel conservation programs and other efforts.
Since January 2019, all airlines flying international routes began 
formal monitoring and reporting of their emissions as part 
of the historic Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for 
International Aviation. The United Nations’ International Civil Aviation 
Organization adopted CORSIA in 2016. With the program in place, 
the industry expects to offset 76% of the growth in global aviation 
CO2 emissions from 2020 onward, based on pre-COVID-19 flying 
trends. Boeing supports the program, including tools and services 
from Boeing Global Services to help our customers with their 
CORSIA reporting needs. 
Achieving this long-term goal requires continued research and 
development in all areas of an airplane and its operation: from 
innovative new airframes, engines and materials technology for 
airplanes of the future—including hybrid and electric-powered 
airplanes—to researching new pathways and scaling up 
sustainable aviation fuel production. Boeing continues making 
technology and innovation investments and collaborating across  
the globe in all of these areas to reduce lifecycle emissions from the 
global fleet and achieve the goal.TABLE OF CONTENTSTABLE OF CONTENTSENVIRONMENT STRATEGY | 41Progress Details 2025 Reduction GoalsENVIRONMENT

solid waste by 15% in 2019, and 
water use by nearly 7% from the 
2017 baseline. The 2025 target 
is reducing both by 20% over the 
baseline year of 2017
Greenhouse gas emissions were 
down 2.8% last year, with a slight 
increase, 0.3%, in overall energy

Hazardous waste reduction 
remains a significant challenge, with a 2.7% increase in 2019 over 
the 2017 baseline. The target is 
a 5% reduction over the baseline 
year of 2017. 
Innovative recycling, such as 
turning excess composite 
material into consumer products, 
is expected to help further 
reduce solid waste in coming 
years. Renewable resources are 
increasingly displacing fossil fuels

  For U.S. sites, Scope 1 emissions from 
natural gas, fuel oil and on-site generated electricity are calculated using the 
emission factors provided in U.S. EPA 
GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule. Scope 2  
emissions from purchased electricity 
are calculated using the market-based 
method and eGRID sub-region factors, 
since residual mix is not available in  
the U.S. For the Canada site, Scope 1  
emissions are calculated using the 
emission factors provided in U.S. EPA 
GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule; Scope 2  
emissions are calculated using the 
market-based method and the supplier-
specific emission factor. For the Australia 
sites, Scope 1 emissions are calculated 
using the emission factors provided in 
the National Greenhouse and Energy 
Reporting (NGER) Scheme, and Scope 2  
emissions are calculated using market-
based method and the emission factors 
provided in the National Greenhouse and 
Energy Reporting (NGER) Scheme, since 
residual mix is not available in Australia. 
Emissions calculated with location-based 
method are: 1,208,000 tons (1,105,000 
metric tons) CO 2e (2019). Emissions 
calculated with Market-based method 
are: 1,075,000 tons (976,000 metric tons) 
CO2e (2019).
  RECs were applied to the GHG calculation 
for the following locations: North 
Charleston, S.C., Portland, Ore., Phoenix, 
Ariz. and 6 Puget Sound locations in 
Wash. In 2019, these Boeing locations 
made arrangements to purchase RECs 
to offset around 148,000 tons (134,000 
metric tons) of GHG emissions.

  Energy use is calculated from consumption  
of electricity, natural gas and fuel oil.  
(Our facility in Philadelphia is the only 
major U.S. site that uses fuel oil for 
heating.) Consumption of other fuels is  
not represented.

from U.S. EPA hazardous manifest 
or equivalent government shipping 
documents
  In addition to data from Boeing’s Core 
Metric Sites, data from Portland, Ore. 
(PDX Paint Hangar); Jacksonville, Fla. 
(Cecil Field); Titusville, Fla.; Oklahoma City, 
Okla.; El Paso, Texas; Wichita, Kan.; and 
Sylmar, Calif., are included.
Endnotes for Global Reporting
Australia National Greenhouse and Energy 
Reporting endnote: This comprehensive 
report must be completed by registered 
corporations that meet specified energy use 
and greenhouse gas emission thresholds. 
For the 2018–2019 reporting period, the 
Australian government’s Clean Energy 
Regulator released data for companies 
emitting approximately 48,500 tons (about 
44,000 metric tons) of equivalent carbon 
dioxide (CO 2e).
Endnotes for Greenhouse Gas  
Corporate Inventory
  The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
reported represent 1,827 buildings in  
44 countries where Boeing has oper -
ational control. Refer to the Site Listing 
Endnotes for the Corporate GHG Inventory 
Chart for cities included.
  Scope 3 emissions only includes emis -
sions from business travel.
  Scope 1 “Other gas types” include CH 4, 
N2O,NF 3 and PFCs  emissions
  Scope 1 “Other fossil fuels” include  
No. 6 fuel oil, gasoline, aviation gasoline, 
propane and LPG.
  1 metric ton = 2,204.62 pounds.
  Carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO 2e, 
means the number of metric tons of CO 2 
emissions with the same global warming 
potential as one metric ton of another 
greenhouse gas. (In accordance with EPA 
40CFR98 Mandatory Greenhouse Gas 
Reporting.)
  Accounting protocol: This GHG inventory 
is prepared using the following protocols: 
 •  The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (Revised Edition); 
 •  The Scope 2 Guidance; 
 •  GHG Reporting Guidance for the 
Aerospace Industry; 
 •  The Australia National Greenhouse and 
Energy Reporting Act; and 
 •  The United Kingdom’s CRC Energy 
Efficiency Scheme.  ENDNOTES
These notes provide details on Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions; greenhouse gas inventory, including various sites; and ISO 14001, the  
international standard that specifies requirement for an effective environmental management system (EMS); among environmental metrics.TABLE OF CONTENTSTABLE OF CONTENTSENDNOTES | 45  Scope 2 emissions are calculated using 
the market-based method. Location-
based method calculated emissions 
are 960,000 tons (871,000 metric tons) 
CO2e. Residual mix is only available 
in EU countries; therefore, other grid 
average emissions factors are used in 
all other countries. In the market-based 
methodology, RECs were applied to the 
GHG calculation for the following loca -
tions: North Charleston, South Carolina, 
6 Puget Sound locations in Washington, 
Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona. 
In 2019, these Boeing locations made 
arrangements to purchase RECs to offset 
around 148,000 tons (134,000 metric tons) 
of GHG emissions. 
  Other calculation factors: Data source 
of global warming potentials (GWP) is 
U.S. 40 CFR 98 subpart A, table A-1. 
For GHG inventory in North America, 
emission factors for combustion sources 
come from U.S. 40CFR 98, subpart C, 
table C-1For GHG inventory in Australia, 
emission factors from the National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 
are used. For GHG inventory in locations 
where energy data are not accessible, 
2012 CBECS factors are used to estimate 
the energy consumption and emission 
factors from the International Energy 
Agency’s “CO2 Emissions from Fuel 
Combustion Highlights 2013” and “2006 
IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories” are used to calculate the 
emissions.
