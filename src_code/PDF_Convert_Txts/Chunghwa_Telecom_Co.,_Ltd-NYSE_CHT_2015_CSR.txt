Chunghwa Telecom’s Operating results were 
exceptionally fruitful in 2015. Our precision 
construction/marketing strategies combined 
with the effort of all our employees had 
delivered record-high consolidated revenues 
totaling NT$231.8 billion and an EPS of NT$5.52 
that marked the best performance in four 
years. By the end of 2015, Chunghwa Telecom 
had accumulated more than 4.4 million 4G 
customers and acquired license to maximum 
bandwidth of 2x30MHz at 2600MHz FDD, 
making it the first local carrier to utilize the 
3CA technology (combining 900, 1800 and 2600 
MHz bands) to exceed the 300Mbps bottleneck 
of 4G telecommunication.
Although optic fiber and 4G technologies have 
presented us with abundant opportunities, 
they are known to be associated with 
challenges such as increasing infrastructure 
and maintenance requirements, and OTT 
(over-the-top) applications that are threatening 
the Company’s existing services. We have 
been actively exploring transformations and 
innovations outside of our core business, such 
as cloud computing, Internet of things (IoT) 
and data security services that would require 
the use of our broadband resources, R&D 
capacity, and big data analysis. By continually 
innovating and expanding across industry 
boundaries, we aim to sustain growth in terms 
of revenue, profit, and business opportunity for 
new services over the next 3 to 5 years.
We recognize the extent of impact our 
operations have on the environment and 
society, and how they affect us in reciprocity. 
To ensure sustainability, Chunghwa Telecom 
developed its own CSR system as early as 2006, 
and has been selected as a composition of DJSI 
- World and DJSI - Emerging Markets for three 
consecutive years, making it one of the world’s 
9 most sustainable telecommunication carriers.
Apart from actively participating in local and 
international sustainability assessments, we 
have also aligned ourselves with international 
trends for the disclosure of non-financial 
information in 2015, and adopted IIRC’s 
Integrated Reporting Framework for the very 
first time during the preparation of our 9th CSR 
report. 
Message from the 
ChairmanG4-105
Chairman of the Board DirectorsIn this year’s report, we not only disclosed 
material issues but also began focusing on 
the values and impacts we produce over the 
course of business operation. By presenting 
a combination of financial and non-financial 
data, we hope to give stakeholders a better 
understanding of various capital committed 
by Chunghwa Telecom and its ability to create 
value through business activities.
In terms of corporate governance, Chunghwa 
Telecom adopts the value of “transparency, 
integrity and stability” as its commitment 
towards sustainability. For 10 straight years, 
we have maintained the best possible rating 
in TWSE / TPEX information disclosure 
evaluation, while our exceptional business 
performance has won ourselves a long-term  
credit rating of “ AA” from S&P and a long-term/  
short-term credit rating of “twAAA/twA-1+” 
from Taiwan Ratings. For two consecutive 
years, we rank in the top 5% of TWSE’s 
corporate governance evaluation. In addition 
to refining our services and complying with  
government regulations, we have escalated 
supplier management practices by introducing 
“tender bond waiver” as a means to reward 
top-performing suppliers in southern Taiwan. 
A set of “Procurement Grievance Procedures” 
has also been implemented to give suppliers 
the means to raise complaints, and thereby 
improve the openness and transparency of 
procurement practices.
With respect to environmental protection, 
Chunghwa Telecom has envisioned itself as  
a “ green enterprise and pioneer in low-carbon 
economy,” and is committed to enhancing the 
greenness of the society through its ICT services. 
Technology brings infinite possibilities, but 
excessive carbon emission and depletion of 
energy sources have also put mankind in a 
struggle for future survival. According to 
the SMARTer2030 report recently published 
by Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI): 
“ICT sector’s emissions footprint is expected 
to decrease to 1.97% of global emissions by 
2030, compared to 2.3% in 2020...and has the 
potential to enable a 20% reduction of global 
CO 2e emissions by 2030.” Driven by our green 
mission, Chunghwa Telecom has made several 
“the first achievement in industry, “ including: 
the first carrier to be certified for GHG 
inventory on Scopes 1, 2 & 3, the first to sponsor 
construction of Youbike station, the first to implement ISO50001, and construction of the 
first Rated-4 IDC in Greater China Region. 
Chunghwa Telecom will continue leading 
the ICT industry to create green values and 
promote greenness in consumption, service 
and business activities for the sustainability of 
our environment.
With respect to social inclusion, Chunghwa 
Telecom has adopted the goal of “narrowing 
the digital divide and creating digital 
opportunities” to guide its social efforts. 
We are committed to eliminating the digital 
divide by making telecommunication services 
available in all corners of Taiwan including 
remote areas and offshore islands. As Internet 
access becomes widely available, knowledge 
and information can be exchanged at a much 
faster rate and hence create opportunities. In 
2015, Typhoon Soudelor caused significant 
damages throughout the nation, including 
telecommunication services. In response to 
the disaster, we mobilized 4,752 employees 
and was able to restore communication at 
impacted locations within the shortest time 
possible. “Digital Community” is one of our 
long-running projects. It has been expanded to 
76 service locations to date, providing a strong 
network of hardware and software resources 
upon which Chunghwa Telecom Foundation 
is able to launch a series of “Click Taiwan“ 
campaigns that connect Chunghwa Telecom 
more closely with local residents.
As we progress into the era of IoT, digital 
convergence and smart services, Chunghwa 
Telecom will carry on its integrity values 
and aim to become “the most valuable and 
trustworthy telecommunication company”by 
relying on its professional technologies and 
visions. In the meantime, the Company 
will also respond to industry upgrades and 
intensified competition by incorporating its 
sustainable culture into three action strategies, 
namely: corporate governance, environmental 
protection, and social inclusion, and emerge as 
the leader of sustainability for the industry and 
the society!
0506Determining Materials and Stakeholders
It is our intention to provide all stakeholders concerned with the future of the telecommunication industry 
and Chunghwa Telecom, with a more comprehensive understanding of how Chunghwa Telecom has 
exerted its industry influence on CSR issues. This purpose has driven us to improve the quality of our 
actions and disclosures.
Boundaries of Material IssuesProcess for Determining Materials Issues
Step.1CSR Secretariat is responsible for collecting the materials to support the meeting of sustainability 
report including international guidelines, sustainability rating survey, international benchmark, etc.
Step.3We assemble an assessment team consisting of members from relative departments to identify 
the material issues matrix on the ground of internal and external information.Step.2Based on internal consideration, industry status, industry chain practice, and the 
recommendations of stakeholders, we asked CSR members to confirm the potential impact of 
the material issues within and outside the organization, in other words, the positive, negative, 
or potential impact on the economy, environment, and society, and later invite key parties 
within and outside the organization to conduct discussion and disclosure of the impact.

Service providers are compelled to provide good quality voice transmission and fast mobile connection to the 
Internet. However, some citizens still have concern about electromagnetic wave. As such, people tend to request 
for the removal of base stations already installed as “electromagnetic waves will jeopardize our health” even 
though the landlord have agreed with the installation.
The right cognition about electromagnetic wave should be:
As described above, the electromagnetic waves generated by base stations are not as damaging as rumored.  
There are many professional websites, local and abroad, that support this claim. However, any resident who has 
concerns regarding base stations near their home can request a complimentary measurement of the strength of 
the nearby electro- magnetic waves by calling 0800-580-010.Issue #1: The Dilemma of Coverage of the Base Station 
The electromagnetic wave emitted from the base station is non-ionizing radiation and the electromagnetic 
particle entails very low energy. It will not give out heat or cause damage to the cell molecules of organism. 
As such, it will not affect the health of human beings.1
The measurement of the electromagnetic wave in the environment is in conformity to the standard of the 
International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)”, which must be lower than 0.45 
μW/cm2 at 900MHz and must be lower than 0.9μW/cm2 at 1,800MHz.  Due to the habit of using mobile 
phones, the public has been exposed to the radio frequency of the mobile phones, which is a thousand times 
more than the waves emitted from a base station.2

Honghwa International Corp. (Honghwa) is a subsidiary of Chunghwa Telecom and provides the frontline 
manpower needed at the Chunghwa Telecom service outlets, customer service hotlines, and customer service 
network. Honghwa also operates as a human resource contractor for other businesses, but does not use the same 
human resource and welfare system as Chunghwa Telecom.
However, to comply with the Chunghwa Telecom CSR philosophy, the service agreement specifically requires 
the contractor to treat its employees in compliance with the Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and 
Health Act, and the Gender Equality in Employment act. In addition, penalties may be imposed for the purpose 
of protecting the interests of the workers. In light of this requirement, Honghwa has also created its own union 
and holds regular discussions to negotiate employment terms that provide employees with proper protection 
and benefits as well as a secure labor-management relationship. 
The Temporary Labor Act is expected to be implemented in the near future, which will limit the 
use of temporary labor to no more than 3% (or 10%) of total employee base. Chunghwa Telecom 
has responded to this new change in advance, as the Human Resource Division held meetings 
with the marketing, network, and customer service teams to discuss feasible solutions.1
By the end of 2015, Chunghwa Telecom used no outsourced labor except HongHwa to operate 
frontline functions such as customer service hotline, customer service network, and service 
outlets.2Following the outbreak of dengue fever in April 2015, the government conducted a series of thorough inspections 
on culverts and manholes, and found Chunghwa Telecom’s manholes likely to breed mosquitoes due to 
dysfunctional drainage. Following the inspections made by the Environmental Protection Bureau, Chunghwa 
Telecom immediately participated in local governments’ prevention measures, and devoted itself to assisting 
local health authorities in the extermination of vectors. 
The health authority had acknowledged the prevention efforts taken by Chunghwa Telecom, and 
reminded businesses of their duties to control vectors and maintain cleanliness of the environment.Issue #2: Vector-borne Disease at Manholes

Chunghwa Telecom is the largest integrated telecommunication carrier in Taiwan. Our head office 
is located at 21-3 Hsinyi Road, Section 1, Taipei. In August 2005, we became a privatized company 
as the ownership by the government was reduced to less than 50%, and the management system 
officially transformed from a state-owned enterprise to a privately-owned enterprise. 
Our main business consists of three major areas: fixed, mobile ,and data communications, providing 
voice services, private circuits, internet, broadband internet, smart network, virtual network, 
e-commerce, corporate customer integration ICT services, and various value-added services. We use 
the best network and service quality as the backing to create intelligent communication environments 
and exciting yet convenient digital lives for our users. Chunghwa Telecom is also an important 
business partner of other international telecommunication carriers. We have been actively involved 
in different “corporate social responsibility” conducts in recent years, and have won the appraisal of 
many domestic and international professional organizations over and over again.

2014 and represented a 100.3% accomplishment rate given the current year’s financial forecast. Due 
to increasing popularity of smart mobile devices, the Company experienced growing revenues from 
value-adding services, sales, and data subscriptions that covered the decline of voice service. Net 
income attributable to parent company amounted to NT$42.81 billion while EPS reached NT$5.52,

In 2015, Chunghwa Telecom’s tax expenses were equivalent to an effective tax rate of 15.73%; 
difference from the 17% statutory tax rate was mainly attributed to the following: according to 
Article 4 of Income Tax Act, net dividends or net earnings recognized from local invested businesses 
are exempted from income tax; and tax privileges from investment credits granted under Article 6 of 
Statute for Upgrading Industries and Article 10 of Statute for Industrial Innovation.Creating Shareholder Value

from Frost&SullivanSep Oct Nov Dec  20The telecommunications industry is a high capital expenditure technology industry with intensive 
technologies, and under the rapid transformation of the industry, the industry value chain of Chunghwa 
Telecom has expanded because of it. In addition to traditional telecom service businesses, we must also 
respond to the challenges and impacts from emerging fields including the cost for the creating and 
maintaining of explosively growing data, cloud big data, content industry and video services (OTT). 
Because of this, Chunghwa Telecom will continue to invest in innovative research and development, 
and combine the hardware and software development capabilities of the upper stream, midstream and 
downstream industry chains to provide differentiated products and eICT services, and integrate the 
power of distributors to expand the market and develop digital convergence industries, creating greater 
business values for enterprises and industries.Telecom Value Chain and Key Performance

value creation factors, and proposed mid-term as well as long-term plans in response to current and 
future challenges.Risks, Opportunities and Mid/Long-term Strategies
Key Factors to 
Creating ValueRisks Opportunities Possible Challenges Mid/Long-term Plans
Standardization and 
development of 5G 
technology5G technology will bring bandwidth to 
everywhere and everything, and would require 
substantial costs to license radio bands and 
construct the needed infrastructures. This 
investment may yield poor return if the billing 
model is not adjusted properlyChunghwa Telecom already possesses the 
competitive advantage and is actively deploying 
resources to capture opportunities first-handTechnical standards and band allocation of the 5G technology 
have yet to be defined; it is difficult to estimate product 
development timeline at this pointEngage with international organizations to grasp the direction 
of technological trends, while at the same time acquire the 
necessary bands and make network improvements to prepare 
for new businesses
Supplier CSR trainingDue to rising CSR awareness, industry leaders 
have been assigned the responsibility to guide the 
entire supply chain towards fulfilling CSR. Failure 
to do so would compromise the leader’s brand 
image and reputationThe Company has the potential to lead or influence 
CSR development across the telecommunication 
supply chain
Reduce suppliers’ risk exposure to environmental 
or human right-related issues, thereby minimize 
possible incidents and disputesSuppliers vary in size, talent, and awareness; they can not be 
trained using the same approach 
Some suppliers are engaged for one-time deals; the costs invested 
may not yield the expected results 
Supplier CSR takes a long time to develop; a fixed amount of 
costs and expenses need to be budgeted on a yearly basis Invite supply chain partners to participate in various courses 
organized at the Telecommunication Training Institute
Investigate and maintain records of suppliers that account 
for significant transaction values or are influential to 
the environment and society. Perform one-on-one CSR 
communication and training
Collaborate with 
suppliers on CSR 
initiativesIn addition to controlling and auditing suppliers’ 
behaviors, the Company also needs to collaborate 
with suppliers on new CSR initiatives for broader 
and more profound effects. Failure to do so would 
compromise future opportunities or affect social 
relationsBy collaborating with suppliers on CSR initiatives, 
we are able to exchange creativity and establish 
good faith that would further strengthen our 
business relationships 
By engaging supply chain partners of different 
industries and specialties, we are able to raise our 
social image and brand value Without long-term relationship, there would be no mutually 
beneficial grounds to engage suppliers in sustainability 
initiatives, which reduces the Company’s efforts to one-time 
events and hence contributes little to the shaping of corporate 
value
It takes long-term engagement, working relationship and trust to 
explore common grounds and find the right CSR initiatives that 
can be communicated and executed with suppliers Invite concerned or willing supply chain partners to participate 
in the Company’s new CSR initiatives or actions
Record and review performance on a yearly basis to find the best  
method of collaboration with suppliers
Subsidies for the socially 
disadvantaged (low-
income households and 
persons with disabilities)Broadband subsidies for the socially 
disadvantaged (low-income households and 
persons with disabilities) would result in loss of 
revenuesLong-term subsidy to the socially disadvantaged 
not only assures them of their basic right to 
communication, but also helps raise corporate 
imageMany persons with disability have been considered as high-
income earners; providing subsidies to them may give rise to 
concern of fairnessRefine the existing subsidy plan to direct broadband privileges 
toward the socially disadvantaged
Renewable energy-
powered based stations at 
remote locationsDisclosing the location of base station may result 
in protests by local residents, and eventually force 
the Company to remove its infrastructureReduce energy usage and minimize greenhouse 
gas emission
Raise the Company’s image as an energy-saving, 
carbon-reducing and environmental friendly 
businessRenewable energy-powered base stations are costly to construct; 
these investments may produce very little yield because of the 
low power generation efficiency
Infrastructures are more difficult to construct and maintain in 
remote areasIn the future, the Company will focus on raising power 
generation efficiency while paying attention to government 
policies; new infrastructures will be constructed on a yearly basis 
at carefully chosen locations
Disruption of knowledge 
transferA vast number of employees are retiring at 
the same time, and would affect the transfer of 
knowledgeUnderstand shortage of manpower within 
Chunghwa Telecom, and accelerate talents 
cultivationThe complexity of business activities and technologies involved 
makes data quite difficult to gather
Personnel expenses are already high, leaving little room for 
further recruitmentConduct job role survey across all six business segments
Build up reserve talents to support the Company’s development
Apply specialized management for talents in the new technology 
field
Occupational safety and 
challengesOccupational safety is an extensive topic. It can be 
difficult to identify, assess and control all factors 
in the work environment            
As employees age, their physical abilities 
deteriorate which puts them in risk of work 
accidents and diseasesTechnologies advance; health and safety officers 
are required to keep up with new materials and 
equipment used in the workplace
Develop suitable health and safety practices for 
each business unit to eliminate work accidents 
while promote employees’ healthRaising employees’ safety awareness and implementing 
safety practices will be a challenging task in the Company’s 
occupational health and safety management system 
The Company will incorporate occupational health and safety 
management as part of its corporate culture Apply “audit and penalty” as a short-term measure, and 
“inspection, awareness promotion and counseling” as a long-
term solution
Develop health inspection and health promotion measures for 
people in the high risk group
Power usage survey and 
management at IDCs
Associated future IDC 
power usage with the 
Company’s renewable 
energy strategyUnstable power supply: renewable energy sources 
have yet to be proven stable over the long term
External stakeholders have grown concerned 
towards Chunghwa Telecom’s ability to operate 
major IDC facilities using renewable power 
sourcesEffective control of power consumption at IDC 
helps reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas 
emission
Use of renewable energy sources in IDC 
applications helps promote a low-carbon city 
and improve the nation’s power generation 
technologiesRenewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are still 
less efficient and costly
These facilities take up larger space and incur additional 
construction costs. It is difficult to find suitable locations in  urban 
areaThe Company will continue focusing on renewable power 
technologies while paying attention to government policies
Survey and analyze power requirement of IDCs; introduce 
renewable energy system at the right timing

helps to translate the concept of CSR into action and is practiced in routine operation.Internalization of Corporate Social Responsibility36Chunghwa Telecom places great emphasis on business risk management as a means of ensuring stability against 
impacts from the external environment and internal operations. It has “Risk Management Policy” in place to guide 
employees’ actions. The board of directors outlines the Company’s risk management policies, framework and culture. 
Secretariat assists the board in the implementation of risk management practices throughout the Company.
The Audit Division audits risk practices and reports findings back to the board. On February 1, 2016, the Company 
established its Risk Management Committee consisting of the President as the convener and senior managers as 
members of the committee. The committee supervises risk management throughout the organization, and is 
responsible for prioritizing the identified risks, formulating response strategies to key risk issues, and reporting to 
the board of directors at times deemed necessary.
Chunghwa Telecom’s risk management practices involve ongoing analysis of operational goals, accuracy of financial 
reports, and impacts of high-risk events. These findings are constantly reviewed to ensure that all business risks can 
be identified and controlled, and thereby maintain business operations while protecting stakeholders’ interests. We 
also have an enterprise risk management (ERM) system in place to control risks associated with our businesses. Risk 
managers have been assigned in all departments to monitor risk targets and risk events, and report findings on a 
monthly basis. Risk managers are also involved in the review and adjustment of risk measures, assessment of risk 
impacts, and execution of systematic records, management, and follow-up tracking.
We use a “risk map” for assessing regulatory risks, network maintenance risks, market competition risks, and 
financial risks. For every major concern identified in our operations, we conduct intensive sensitivity analysis and 
stress-testing to decide whether we should take steps to accept, transfer, mitigate or avoid the associated risks, 
thereby minimize our possible losses. Risk management expenditure comprises of three main categories: insurance 
premium, risk control costs, and risk administration expenses; details of which are expected to be disclosed in 2017.

On August 8, 2015, Typhoon Soudelor brought heavy rain and wind to Taiwan, causing massive disaster 
especially in remote, mountainous locations such as Wulai, Sanxia, and Yilan. Wulai, in particular, 
suffered a total power failure and severance of 2 fiber cables owned by Chunghwa Telecom. This damage 
disabled all communication and isolated Wulai from the outside world.
Chunghwa Telecom mobilized 4,752 employees into an emergency repair that took place day and night 
at the risk of land slide. Their efforts were motivated by one simple purpose: to restore communication 
as soon as possible so that residents can begin rebuilding their homes.Go All Out: Emergency Repair after Typhoon Soudelor

Chunghwa Telecom’s business operations are closely connected to changes in government policies and 
regulations. In this respect, we maintain constant communication with government agencies and authorities 
to keep ourselves informed of the direction of the latest policies and regulations. Amongst all upcoming 
changes, the one that concerns the competitiveness of the ICT industry the most would be the “Digital 
Convergence Plan.”
The “Digital Convergence Plan” was first approved by the Executive Yuan in 2010, and was scheduled 
to undergo a two-stage legislative process. National Communication Commission (NCC) passed its a 
“comprehensive draft legislative framework on converging digital telecommunication transmissions” on 
October 14, 2015 that propose five pieces of legislation – the Telecommunication Business Act, Regulations 
Governing the Service of Cable Multi-Channel Platform, the Radio and Television Enterprises and Channel 
Enterprises Administration Act, Regulations Governing Telecommunication Infrastructures and Resources, 
and the Electronic Telecommunication Act – to constitute a legal framework for converging digital 
telecommunication transmissions. Such proposal had already passed Executive Yuan’s review in May 2016, 
and were submitted for ratification at the Legislative Yuan.
However, since the new administration was inaugurated, these draft regulations were withdrawn by the 
Executive Yuan along with other proposals that had yet to progress into Legislative Yuan’s review process. We 
will continue paying attention to new changes in regulation, and contribute its opinions where appropriate.Pay Attention to Digital Convergence DevelopmentClimate

Risk38“As the leader of mobile communication service in Taiwan, Chunghwa Telecom has been active in the 
development of 5G technology and is currently a member of NGMN. Our status as an NGMN member 
provides us with knowledge to the development of 5G standards around the world, which we hope to 
make use of in order to introduce more advanced mobile communication services to local consumers. 
It is also our intention to engage the local telecommunication industry with the rest of the world in the 
early stages of 5G technology, so that we may play a vital part in the upcoming future.”
——Lih-Shyng Tsai, Chairman of Chunghwa Telecom
In an attempt to gain an early insight into next-generation telecommunication technologies, Chunghwa 
Telecom has not only committed significant resources into R&D and actively involved itself in setting 
the new standards (under 3GPP), but also explored means to strengthen connections with local and 
foreign industry participants. In 2015, Chunghwa Telecom joined Taiwan Association of Information 
and Communication Standards (TAICS) and Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance (NGMN) ; both 
of which are significant to the development of 5G technology.
Chunghwa Telecom is the only Taiwanese carrier to join NGMN, which now has 28 members from 
around the world. Chunghwa Telecom has one representative on the NGMN board to bridge Taiwan’s 
5G development with the rest of the world.
In December 2015, Chunghwa Telecom joined the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to host a 
NGMN Conference for the very first time in Taiwan, during which participants were gathered to discuss 
and explore 5G requirements. Later in February 2016, Chunghwa Telecom participated in NGMN’s 
2016 Mobile World Congress held in Spain to discuss work plan and short-term goals. This level of 
engagement has helped raised influence and visibility of Taiwan’s telecommunication industry in the 
world.Involvement in Next-generation Telecom Technology

The introduction of 4G technology has enabled carriers to exceed existing bandwidth and speed 
limitations and deliver faster Internet services. This, in turn, gave rise to broader applications and 
presented both risks and opportunities to Chunghwa Telecom.
Chunghwa Telecom had accumulated 4.43 million 4G customers by the end of 2015. In an attempt 
to keep up with the rapidly changing and increasingly competitive environment, the Company has 
committed significant resources into innovative research and development (totaling NT$3.6 billion in 
2015; representing 1.6% of overall revenues) to improve customers’ mobile broadband experience and 
digital lifestyle by continually exploiting bandwidths of the 4G technology.Intensive Competition of the 4G Market
Risks
There are five carriers offering 4G services in Taiwan, making it a highly competitive business. 
Competition in 4G mobile will only intensify and pose a threat to Chunghwa Telecom’s operations in 
the future.
Opportunities
Smart city and Internet of things (e.g. Internet of vehicles, remote education, hospital monitoring, smart 
home, smart energy, etc.) are two prominent trends. Combined with big data applications, they open up 
new products and services for Chunghwa Telecom.

Risk39To establish a corporate culture of ethical management, we have established the “Code of Ethics of 
Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd.”, “Ethical Corporate Management Best Practice Principle”, and “Procedures 
for Ethical Management and Guidelines for Conduct”. These are formulated as the basic guideline for 
employees’ethical standard while engaging commercial activities so as to have all employees perform 
business activities at the highest moral standard. 
In addition to adding the training program of new employee, all employees are required to login to the 
web to review and take the test every year, we also have a reporting hotline to encourage employees to 
voice their opinions in a safe and confidential manner. Other than those who were not available during 
the testing period, all other employees have participated in the test in 2015.Highest Moral Standard
*Chunghwa Telecom internal policy: http://www.cht.com.tw/aboutus/companyrules.htmlChunghwa Telecom has “Employee Appraisal Guidelines” and “Employee Reward/Disciplinary Standards” in place 
to evaluate employees’ performance. Rewards and disciplines are issued according to these rules whenever employees 
exhibit conducts that deserve them.
Information such as grievance hotline has been made available at Chunghwa Telecom’s intranet/employee portal. The 
Company accepted and closed 50 cases of complaint in 2015; 2 of which were found to have violated the confidentiality 
policy, while 8 were associated with violation against the code of conduct. All complaints were investigated and 
handled according to Chunghwa Telecom’s internal policies and principles, and taught as case studies to strengthen 
employees’respect towards rules, discipline, corporate image, and shareholders’interests.Corruption Prevention
Chunghwa Telecom adopts a corporate governance practice that emphasizes on integrity, accountability, and 
trustworthiness. We are committed to reducing information asymmetry between the management and external 
stakeholders, and utilize a variety of means such as corporate website, Market Observation Post System, annual report, CSR 
report, press conference and investor seminar to facilitate transparent communication with stakeholders. Furthermore, 
measures have been taken to ensure the timeliness, quality, balance, and credibility of information disclosed.
Since information disclosure assessment was first launched by Securities & Futures Institute in 2004, Chunghwa Telecom 
has been rated A++ and ranked among the top 10 in every year. Also in 2015, the Company ranked among the top 5% in 
TWSE’s first corporate governance evaluation. These two achievements are a testament to the efforts we have devoted 
in information disclosure!Transparent Disclosure*Organization and functioning of Chunghwa Telecom’s internal audit unit: http://goo.gl/46A4jyWe have an internal audit unit that reports directly to the board of directors. The audit unit conducts internal

managers by constantly reviewing the effectiveness of internal control systems and operating efficiency.Internal Audit System
To improve the quality of business marketing and consumers’trust, we have formulated the “Business 
Marketing Standards” to ensure the execution of business in line with the requirement of competent authority, 
while including compliance status into the evaluation of higher management’s performance.
Owing to the control measures in place, the Company received only one penalty totaling NT$800,000 due to violation 
against the Fair Trade Act in 2015. Background and subsequent improvements relating to the violation are explained below:Strengthen Business Management
The business division posted an advertisement featuring a “comparison of TV subscription charges using 100M+ 
broadband.” Content of this advertisement was reported for suspected violation against the Fair Trade Act, which 
the Fair Trade Commission later investigated and concluded that the advertisement did indeed misrepresent 
competitors’Internet and TV services, to the extent capable of producing false impressions.
An order of correction was issued by the Fair Trade Commission, which Chunghwa Telecom took seriously by 
ceasing all exposure of the advertisement immediately, and assigning relevant units to review all advertisement 
contents while educate employees on the Fair Trade Act and proper business/marketing practices.1.

We value our relationship with suppliers for offering quality products and services to consumers. 
Chunghwa Telecom’s suppliers can be divided into three categories: property,labour and engineering 
We make enormous purchases from an extensive number of suppliers, from networking equipment, data 
equipment, cables, marketing design, to waste disposal services.
This means that we possess great influence to convince suppliers into supporting our social responsibilities. 
Chunghwa Telecom utilizes four approaches, namely: contractual terms, questionnaire surveys, Supplier 
CSR Interchange Meeting, and on-site audits, to raise suppliers’ awareness and understanding towards 
CSR, as well as the commitments we have made in supply chain management. For suppliers that have 
just begun to familiarize with the CSR concept, we choose to encourage their participation while at the 
same time provide them with the proper education and assistance; over time, we hope to engage all 
suppliers in a win-win relationship.
 “Code of Corporate Social Responsibility for Suppliers of Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd.” clearly outlines 
the Company’s expectations in terms of “ business, ethics, labor, environment, safety and health.” 
The guidelines apply to all suppliers that provide products or services to Chunghwa Telecom or its 
subsidiaries or joint ventures, and extends to other participants of the supply chain that the supplier 
is directly or indirectly related to. We hope that suppliers may commit to our values and take more 
proactive steps toward maintaining a sustainable business relationship.

conducted a trial in southern Taiwan, offering qualified 
suppliers the privilege of “tender bond waiver when 
submitting tenders, and reduction of performance bond 
to 5% the value of contract won.” This was one of the 
Company’s attempts to exert our influence as an industry 
leader and bring more attention to corporate social

In an attempt to support the government’s industrial development policies, Chunghwa Telecom has 
partnered with SME Credit Guarantee Fund for the launch of “Firefly Credit Guarantee Program.” Any top-
performing suppliers recommended by Chunghwa Telecom are eligible to apply for credit guarantee under 
this program. Our involvement has assisted small and medium sized suppliers to obtain the funding they 
need, and encouraged them to devote efforts into innovation and R&D that would further enhance their 
competitiveness.
By the end of 2015, the Company had recommended 20 suppliers for the program, of which 17 were able to 
obtain funding totaling NT$278 million.As we hope to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship 
with supply chain partners, our Telecommunication Training 
Institute has been providing suppliers with relevant training 
and certification courses to satisfy their requirements. 
Some of the popular courses include: cabling contractor 
certification, telecom line construction quality assurance 
certification, and fiber optic contractor training. In 2015, the

Changes in the global environment and climate have given rise to the idea of low-carbon economy 
and green consumption. Sustainable products and services will gradually become the mainstream 
in consumers’ purchases, which we believe will be made possible once smart city and related 
applications become available.
1 million paying users in 4G smart city; potential 
to contribute NT$70 billion of GDP
NT$40 billion of business value to be created from 
4G access
Smart city has the potential to create NT$30 billion 
in business opportunities, and increase the value 
of 4G services to NT$1.56 trillion by 2017
We collaborated with the Industrial Development Bureau and local government bodies in the launch of 
4G smart city project
We spent NT$312 million to develop three custom-tailored smart city applications for Taipei City: 
“accessibility service,” “culture/creativity/tourism service,” and “smart shopping service.” The ultimate 
goal is to build Taipei into a friendly, cultured smart city favored by touristsComplete network infrastructure and the

48Chunghwa Telecom remains devoted in green innovation, and strives to accomplish our goals 
through green consumption, green service, and green activities. We hope to apply our advantages in 
environmental protection and energy conservation onto existing products and services, as we view 
business and environmental sustainability our competitive focus and opportunity. In 2015, there 
was NT$5,350.2 million revenues from green products, which accounted for 2% of total revenues.
The iEN service features three energy focuses: clean energy, energy management, and professional 
service, and six water focuses: “segment planning,” “water management,” “water quality monitoring,” 
“effluent recycling,” “desalination of seawater,” and “agricultural return flow.” A smart energy office 
and a water resource management office have been created to serve as an open platform for product 
solutions across industries. The smart energy office features a professional team of consultants to offer 
total energy conservation services from construction, marketing, to lifestyle applications. Its mission 
is to optimize energy management in ways that improve system efficiency and reduce operating costs.
We hope to increase the capacity of our renewable energy supply and improve the efficiency of which 
energy is used, so that we can become less dependent of conventional energy sources. Since the initial 
launch, the service has been widely adopted by hospitals, schools, government institutions, fish farms 
and mass retailers. This service has won multiple awards for Chunghwa Telecom, including two 
consecutive Best Energy Technology Service Provider from the Bureau of Energy, MOEA.
In Hsinchu City, for example, the iEN service was incorporated into Hsinchu City Government’s “LED 
Street Lamp Replacement Project”, where an IoT structure was developed and combined with map system 
to facilitate remote management and service call for street lamps. The combination of IoT infrastructure 
and energy-saving technology also has the potential for other smart applications including control of 
campus air conditioning, hot water supply, lighting, and street lamp upgrade.Intelligent Energy Network Service (iEN)

This service incorporates the use of several advance technologies including smart in-car units, GIS, 
and smart transport system. It is well-integrated with customer service platforms used by taxi fleets 
to deliver functionalities such as fleet management, dispatch, customer service, safety monitoring, 
statistical report, emergency aid etc. The system captures GPS data transmitted from in-car units installed 
in taxis to give the taxi company a comprehensive view on the whereabouts, speed and direction of 
current vehicles. In addition to assuring passengers a safe journey to their destination, the system is also 
effective in reducing the vacancy rate, which makes it a multi-win solution for the Company, the taxi 
fleet, the driver and passenger. 
The “Smart Taxi Dispatch Solution” offers the following advantages to a taxi fleet:
More efficient dispatch:  The time taken to process taxi bookings has been reduced from an average 
of 46 seconds to 20 seconds.
Increased passenger load and shortened waiting time: With a 28% increase in daily taxi bookings, the 
percentage of vacant taxis on the street was effectively reduced, allowing drivers to work 20% lesser 
time.
Lower fuel consumption and carbon emission: By using GPS to pinpoint and dispatch vehicles, taxi 
drivers are no longer required to drive around looking for customers, which saves fuel consumption 
by approximately 17%.
SMS service through the “TAXI App”:  The “TAXI App” not only allows consumers to call taxis using 
their smartphones or tablets, it can also be configured to send text messages to relatives as soon as 
picked up. Ƕ

month and was finally able to identify the root cause. After conveying this issue to the cellphone 
engineer, Ms. Hsieh’s problems were finally resolved.
Ms. Hsieh was overwhelmed with relief knowing that her phone was working properly, and said 
to the customer service officer: “Thank you! After all this trouble, I finally found the right person, 
just when I was about to give up. Only you were able to solve my problem, and I am very happy!”
Later, Ms. Hsieh gave an extensive complement for the customer service officer at Chunghwa 
Telecom’s web page, hoping to encourage and recognize the efforts made by this “right customer 
service officer.” In response, customer service officer Wen-Li Luo replied that Ms. Hsieh was about 
the same age as her mother, which naturally caused her to treat the customer as family, as all 
customer service officers are expected to do. Being able to solve Ms. Hsieh’s problems and receive 
compliment for it has been a pleasantly memorable experience to her.The Right Customer Service Officer62
Chunghwa Telecom makes ceaseless effort to expand the volume and upgrade the quality of our 
4G mobile communication system. We introduced advanced technologies, which echoed with the 
1800/900MHz base stations. This arrangement allows for the coverage of service from points, lines, 
and to planes for even more extensive and better quality mobile broadband network service. 
In view of upcoming demands for digital convergence and new digital lifestyles, Chunghwa Telecom 
has launched high-speed fiber services at 300Mbps to satisfy users’ need for high-speed applications. 
With this service, Taiwan has formally progressed from the megabit era to the gigabit era.Ensure Service Quality
Broadband Internet Infrastructure Progress
The infrastructure met the goals of the government’s 
“Digital Convergence Program,” which is to achieve 
“7.2 million optic fiber users and 11 million wireless 
broadband users by 2015.”Year of construction:
2012 ~ 2016Amount invested:
NT$ 100 billion63
By the end of 2015, we have installed more than 55,000 public Wi-Fi hotspots, giving users access to 
stable, high-bandwidth and densely covered Wi-Fi service.
In the meantime, we have also supported the government’s initiative in promoting free wireless 
Internet services on a nationwide scale. With the availability of a reasonable Wi-Fi rental package, 
a robust user authentication platform and a nationwide maintenance/monitoring system, we 
have helped the government deploy free Wi-Fi hotspots all over the country. In terms of social 
engagement, we have been working with local county/city governments to install hotspots and 
enable Internet access during festive occasions, such as the 215 hotspots installed for New Year’s 
Eve event and the 257 hotspots installed for Taichung Lantern Festival. Overall, the Company had 
spent more than NT$8.55 million in this regard.Expand Wireless Hotspots
To satisfy the public’s expectation for available communication, Chunghwa Telecom has signed a 
lease agreement with Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation to install Wi-Fi hotspots at Taipei Metro 
stations on top of the public pay phones that are already in place. These hotspots have provided a 
boost to Internet connection quality for the benefit of commuters and tourists.
Currently, there are 826 public pay phones and 282 Wi-Fi hotspots deployed throughout 117 stations 
of Taipei Metro system. In 2015, the Wi-Fi hotspots were used by 25 million people and logged in 
45 million times, which was an extraordinary achievement.Wi-Fi Hotspots in Taipei Metro642015 Consumer Satisfaction Survey ResultsWe conduct a broad variety of satisfaction surveys to identify consumers’ most concerned issues 
and expectations, and use these findings to guide our future improvements.
After each survey, consumers’ opinions and suggestions are conveyed promptly to product 
or business personnel (including risk management and public relations departments) using the 
consumer feedback system. Furthermore, consumers’ opinions are brought to the attention of the 
head of product and customer service departments, and discussed in monthly meetings to ensure 
that consumers’ expectations are met.
Regarding to the items belonging to the fourth quadrant (high importance and low performance) 
according to the results of annual satisfaction survey, we will request relevant functional units to 
conduct further analysis and propose concrete improving measures annually. Also, there will be a 
follow-up keeping track of the condition of corrective actions next quarter.Consumer Satisfaction SurveyTo ensure that consumers’ need is satisfied, we conduct customer satisfaction survey for Chunghwa 
Telecom service center, customer service hotline and installation & repair service every year so that 
we can provide the best possible service and continuous improvement on our services. In addition 
to regular consumer satisfaction survey conducted by third party, we also accept NCC’s service 
quality survey on telecom carriers on the regular basis. The results show that our performance is 
significantly better than the standard requested by NCC.Ensure Customer Satisfaction

carrier to have call center certified for “ISO 10002:2004 - 
Customer Complaint Management System.” The Company 
sees customer’s complaint as an opportunity to make ongoing 
improvements. We have imposed rules to resolve customers’ 
dissatisfaction, complaints and opinions within 3 working days, 
and hence ensure continuous improvement of service quality.
Apart from the customer service hotline, consumers may also 
use the corporate website or the general line (02-23446789) to 
raise complaints directly to assistants of the senior executives. To 
further enhance consumers’ satisfaction, we have collaborated 
with external institutions to develop a detection system for 
potential customer complaints while at the same time taking 
step to improve on the complaints raised. Owing to our effective 
control, the NCC’s 2015 “Telecommunication Consumer 
Complaint Monitoring Report” showed Chunghwa Telecom 
exhibiting the lowest complaint rate among peers.Customer Service Hotline KPI
According to data on mobile communication customer complaints compiled by the NCC in 2015, which 
is based on the complaint per every millions of users, Chunghwa Telecom is the service provider with 
the least complaints! 
In the future, we will further improve our service quality by simplifying our complaint process for 
consumers’ convenience, so that all consumers’ needs can be addressed in a professional and timely 
manner.Lowest Average Cases of Customer Complaints Customer Service Response within 20 Seconds KPI

D66We conduct annual rehearsals on a broad number of situations from coordinating network 
resources and equipment to emergency repairs. Our base stations have been deployed in a 
diversified manner and are covered by robust backup plans so that failure of circuitry, power 
or equipment at any base station would not disrupt another base station nearby.Response 
Measures
Areas that are enclosed and accessible only through one road, such as Suhua Highway, are 
covered using multiple base stations so that even if one station were to be damaged due to 
natural disaster, other paired stations may still function and keep the area covered with signals. 
This arrangement has served its purpose in major accidents happened in the last two years, and 
kept the disaster area connected at all times.Special CaseIf communication is severed in the unfortunate event of a natural disaster, we would take 
contingency measures (such as microwave radio, satellite transmission, movable base station 
etc.) depending on the actual circumstances to maintain communication between the disaster 
location and the outside worldOccurrence 
of Disaster
With experiences learned from past disaster relief, we have established multi-route transmission, 
backup routing with wireless sensor and higher capacity (good for 72 hours) backup battery in 
remote areas, so that the remote areas will not be isolated from communication with the outside 
world due to power outages caused by natural disaster.Enhance Disaster Response and Communication Coverage
Chunghwa Telecom has installed solar energy modules with 1~2kW rated capacity for 10 base 
stations located at remote areas including Yilan, Hsinchu, Shoushan (Keelung) and New Taipei 
City. These solar modules provide base stations with clean, carbon-less energy under normal 
circumstances, and can be used to power emergency communication if primary power is disrupted 
due to natural disaster.Renewable Energy-Powered Based Stations at Remote Locations67
Sought to minimize the impact of disasters through prompt information communication services, 
Chunghwa Telecom’s “Emergency Response SMS System” sent out more than 210,000 SMS alerts in 
2015. Its role in disaster prevention and notification is outstanding.
Additionally, we have assisted the Directorate General of Highways by sending SMS messages to 
warn nearby pedestrians and vehicles of possible or occurred collapse, landslide, snow buildup, 
and road accident. This service has been well-received by government authorities and the public.Disaster Reporting and Upgraded Safety
The Company assisted New Taipei City Government in organizing “Civil Safety Drill #1,” during 
which more than 16,000 SMS messages were sent in the drill location. Furthermore, there are 
hundreds of areas that have been identified as prone to the risk of flood and landslide (e.g. 
downstream of dam and lowlands), and if an alert event occurs, the Company will distribute SMS 
to warn residents of nearby area to take precautions early.Civil Safety Drill #1
The Company assisted Atomic Energy Council, Executive Yuan in organizing “Nuclear Safety 
Drill #21,” and supported regular drills held by Taiwan Power Company.Nuclear Safety Drill #21 – 2015
The arrival of Typhoon Soudelor in 2015 caused disruptions of land line telephone, Internet connection and 
MOD services to our customers. We then followed the terms of our business policy and service agreement and 
took the initiative to reduce subscription charges in protection of consumers’ interests. A sum of NT$1,916,000 
had been spent to compensate 5,133 pieces of equipment that were damaged during the disaster.
Furthermore, the Company has also been providing the following discounts for victims of Wulai as a means 
to relieve their financial burden:Compensation and Discounts for Disaster Victims
For fixed line network, leased lines, broadband connections, HiNet subscriptions, and MOD services, 
monthly subscriptions were reduced or waived entirely according to terms and conditions until services 
were restored, while billing and overdue disconnection were postponed accordingly.
Fee waivers for victims who applied for relocation of land line telephone, broadband (ADSL and fiber 
network), HiNet or MOD, or modification of call forwarding or voice mail services.
Disaster victims may replace phone units, broadband modems and set top boxes they have rented from 
Chunghwa Telecom at no charge.Ƕ

Ƕ68Alleviate Public Concerns in Electromagnetic Radiation
Advocate the Accurate Understanding of Electromagnetic Wave
The Company joined NCC and 19 county/city governments nationwide to host 19 seminars on the topic of 
electromagnetic wave. 269 complimentary electromagnetic wave measurements have been completed to date; 
all results are compliant with government regulations.
Local government bodies were issued promotional materials and pamphlets on the knowledge of electromagnetic 
wave, which could be distributed to the public during various activities to promote proper understanding.
In 2015, a series of training seminars were organized for frontline engineers stationed in North district branch to 
enhance communication skills when confronted by protesters. Meanwhile, the Company continues to promote 
proper knowledge of electromagnetic wave using short videos.Ƕ

Ƕ
ǶResearch conducted by international organizations including WHO have found no conclusive 
scientific evidence regarding the harmful effect of electromagnetic waves on human health. However, 
to eliminate customers’ doubts, Chunghwa Telecom ensures strict compliance with the authority’s 
safety standards when constructing telecom infrastructures.
All mobile communication products purchased by us have a Specific Absorption Rate that complies 
with NCC’s limits. In addition, we donate NT$500,000 per year to Taiwan Electromagnetic Industry-
Academia Consortium to study the effect of electromagnetic wave on health and safety.
In 2015, Chunghwa Telecom was incurred NT$7.8 million of fines and administrative penalties on 
20 counts of violation associated with base stations. These violations had occurred as we sought 
to address consumers’ demand for “good reception” and concern towards “base station health 
impacts.” Given the scarcity of suitable base station locations, the Company will strive to comply 
with regulations by taking precautions at different stages of installation.
Assess factors such as the size and concentration of population, radio coverage, and number of customer 
complaints, capacity of existing base stations nearby, and local residents’ tolerance towards a new base 
station. Once consent has been obtained from the building management board or local residents, the 
Company may proceed to rent land and space for the construction of base station.ǶCommunication 
and Assessment 
Phase
Information of the proposed base station is submitted to NCC for review; installation may begin only if the 
proposal passes review.Ƕ Installation 
Phase
Conduct emergency phone tests. Aim to pass NCC’s base station assessment tests that have been developed 
based on the standards developed by International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP). Conduct routing tests to verify the functionality and coverage of the tested equipment.
All our base stations have been tested to exhibit power density that complies with standards.Ƕ

ǶPre-operation 
Phase
To prevent antennas from promising visual appearance, the Company will coordinate with other carriers 
to make coherent and integrated base station designs that conform to the overall environment. Doing so 
would minimize environmental impacts and facilitate more effective use of limited space.
The Company had completed visual improvements on 60% of base station antennas in accordance with 
“Regulations for Administration of Base Stations of Mobile Communications Network Businesses.”
The Legislative Yuan passed the  “Recognize performance credit for offering of state-owned building or 
land in base station constructions.” This new policy will improve communication quality.Ƕ

Chunghwa Telecom treats employees as the most important business partner. In addition to implementing 
a fair compensation/welfare system and assuring employees’ basic work rights/human rights, the 
Company has also been active in the creation of a safe work environment.
For best protection of employees’ work rights, Chunghwa Telecom signs “employment contracts” with 
individual employees and notifies them of changes in the terms of employment in accordance with Labor 
Standards Act. Furthermore, we exploit various communication channels including seminars and labor-
management meetings to maintain a harmonious and mutually beneficial working relation.
We have a “Compensation Committee” in place to ensure competitive compensation for the best 
talents. In addition, the Company has a transparent system of sharing business performance with its 
employees. Compensations for the executive management have been standardized with details publicly 
disclosed in annual reports. The Company offers equal compensation for entry-level employees of the 
same grade. Those who possess relevant skills and work experience may have compensation evaluated 
based on educational background, career experience, expertise, and professional certification. Under no 
circumstances will compensation be determined based on gender or racial differences.
Our employees averaged a 2.5% salary adjustment in 2015, while the highest adjustment was made at 
5.5%. Given the fact that entry-level employees were relatively young and prone to higher financial 
burdens, our salary adjustments were primarily focused towards entry-level employees, and those with 
lesser monthly salaries were entitled to higher percentage increase.A Competitive Compensation SystemProtect Employee Rights72Taiwanese, Full-time

Ƕ75We adopt a business focus of “core competitiveness, professionalism, efficiency, and service” and seek to 
develop innovative talents through a combination of internal and external training. 
We have a comprehensive training system to assist employees’ development in all dimensions. The 
system incorporates “needs analysis” and “in-depth planning” before a program begins, and follows 
up with performance assessment and review after a program ends. This systematic approach enhances 
employees’ professional skills and work efficiency, and enables the Company to make better coordination 
of human resources.
In order to sustain competitive advantage, Chunghwa Telecom 
has founded a “Telecommunication Training Institute” that 
specializes in training technical as well as managerial talents in the 
telecommunication field. Furthermore, a “Talent Development 
Team” has been convened by the President to conduct regular 
reviews on the planning and outcome of the Company’s 
training efforts, thereby making sure that the training programs 
are practical and closely aligned with operational policies.
The Institute currently offers 870 professional training courses 
in 19 categories including networking and marketing. It also has 
managerial courses available to enhance employees’ technical 
as well as managerial capabilities. Professional training totaled 
35,856 persons in 2015, while managerial courses received a 
total of 2,354 persons.Dedicated Training UnitsEmployee Training and Development 
The Institute has been entrusted with the mission of supporting the Company’s business strategies and visions. 
Its human resource development strategies were formulated based on Chunghwa Telecom’s business focus 
and talent requirements in 2016~2018.Talent Development Strategies of the Telecommunication Training Institute
Alignment of training and business development: formulate training solutions in congruency with the 
Company’s strategic goals and plans.
Nurturing of managerial talents: recent survey has indicated significant number of retirements in senior 
positions over the next 5 years. It is imperative for mid-level managers to develop the skills needed to 
accomplish more complex tasks. Senior reserve talents are required to undergo a stringent training process. 
There should be an assessment system after the training program to develop a talent base for future reference.
Professional training: focus on developing work skills and certifications needed to support the Company’s 
growth, and embodies a broad range of training courses on managerial as well as technical skills.
Digital and diverse learning: through the use of interactive, mixed and social learning approaches, we enable 
employees to develop knowledge online at their own convenience. Furthermore, other learning aids such as 
social networks and on-site experts are being utilized to enhance employees’ learning progress.Ƕ

76To meet organizational needs, personal interest and personality traits of employees, Telecommunication 
Training Institute provides a diversity of channels for leaning, to help employees develop their professional 
skills in depth and refine their management skills. These help to bring about growth and proper career 
development of employees.
Employees can receive training at the Telecommunication Training Institute during regular hours and in the 
evening or on holidays. Telecommunication Training Institute can also dispatch tutors to relevant business 
units for organizing training. We offers diversified learning channels: class teaching, distance education, digital 
learning, holiday course, evening classes, tutor, take programs externally, and digital library.
The orientation is intended to provide new recruits with 
a general understanding of the organization’s visions, 
ideals, values and culture that would help them adapt 
at a faster rate. In 2014, we established “New Recruit 
Counseling Guidelines for Chunghwa Telecom and 
Subordinate Institutions” and introduced a counselor 
system along with digital learning tools to help shorten 
employee’s learning curve.
Chunghwa Telecom has instituted the “Employees Performance Evaluation Guidelines” which are 
applicable to all employees so as to evaluate the performance of employees and develop the corporate 
culture where employees, customers, shareholders, and the Company are winners. For a particular 
employee who is underperforming, the Company will give supervision to guide their corrective action 
and keep track on the correction until improvement is made under appropriate procedures. 
Chunghwa Telecom conducts performance appraisal in three different levels: entry-level staff, entry 
and mid-level managers, and senior managers. A performance appraisal involves a series of face-to-
face discussions between employee and line manager at the beginning of year to set personal goals, 
and at mid-year and year-end to evaluate employee’s contribution to the Company’s performance. 
During these sessions, managers would also discuss with employees about career plans and suggest 
courses that are relevant to their future careers. Performance bonus and employee remuneration are 
tied to employees’ individual performances.Diversified Learning Channels

Fair Assessment MechanismAccording to an internal manpower survey, Chunghwa Telecom will encounter a retirement wave of senior 
managers in five years. The following measures have been developed in response to the retirement wave and 
to resolve possible disruption in the transfer of knowledge:Recruitment and Development of New-Generation Talents
Engage HongHwa where necessary to fill in shortfalls of frontline staff.
Recruit additional talent for the R&D of new information, ICT and 4G technologies and to support business

Chunghwa Telecom incurred more than NT$500 million in training expenses and trained employees for a 
total of 1.07 million hours. Meanwhile, we encourage employees to commit to life-long learning, offering as 
much as NT$30,000 of education subsidy per semester. 776 people had applied subsidies and their efforts were 
compensated by the Company for NT$11.45 million.Nurturing of Professional Talents
Note: We adopted a precision training policy in 2015 and engaged internal instructors to teach many of our 
courses. As a result, the amount of budgeted training expenses had decreased while the number of total and 
average training hours remained unchanged from 2014.
We have been cooperating with 4 major universities (NTU, NCTU, NTHU, and NCU) to offer summer 
internship for 12 candidates. All interns are properly compensated and offered comprehensive training 
courses. Furthermore, in an attempt to develop overseas telecommunication talents, the “Chunghwa Telecom 
Southeast Asian Scholarship” program has been introduced to offer scholarship for top students of Southeast 
Asian origin or residency. Candidates of the scholarship program may even have the chance to participate in 
R&D projects or be assigned to work as interns at various branches.Academic Talent Training

Since 2011, we have been engaging outside 3rd parties to conduct annual “Chunghwa Telecom Work Happiness 
Survey” on an anonymous basis. These surveys are designed to measure employees’ satisfaction towards 
the work environment, welfare and compensation. It serves as a means of learning employees’ opinions and 
understanding how they feel and what they expect about work.
Since the surveys began, the Company has received increasing level of satisfaction and response year after year. 
In the future, we will continue to respond and communicate on employees’ opinions, and provide suitable 
training to further enhance employees’ satisfaction and happiness.78Chunghwa Telecom was the first telecommunication service provider in Taiwan to adopt 
Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSAS 18000). By the end of 2015, the 
Company already had 27 business groups and branches that passed international certification.
We actively participate in the government’s initiatives to promote healthy workplace. 7 divisions 
within the Company have received awards under the “National Workplace Safety and Health 
Campaign” organized by Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Ministry of Labor. 
The Northern Taiwan Business Group, in particular, ranked first in Taipei City’s Most Healthy 
Workplaces, and received the National Exemplary Healthy Workplace Award from Health 
Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare.
We adopt systematic management to ensure employees’ health and safety. In addition to identifying 
hazards and assessing risks associated with telecom operations, the Company has also applied 
restrictions and enhanced risk control for high-risk tasks, while taking effective precautions to 
prevent occupational hazards. In addition to complying with safety and health regulations, the 
Company has also been active in the improvement of current work environment and taking actions 
in regards to safety and health facilities.Occupational Health and Safety

implementation of labor safety and health matters, meanwhile, “Labor safety and health committee” 
is established and meets quarterly to deliberate, coordinate and make suggestions on the issues of 
labor safety and health. 
“Labor safety and health committee” consists of 26 members, including representatives from 
each department units and labor union as well as technician and medical personnel, etc. Among 
which, 9 members are from labor union accounted for 35% of all members. 4 meetings were held 
in 2015 with 11 proposals presented by the labor representatives of which 5 related to the issue 
of the improvement of safety and health facilities, 2 related to refinement of safety and health 
management, 1 related to food hygiene, and 3 related to employee benefits.Dedicated Occupational Safety and Health Management Unit
In order to provide immediate medical assistance, we hired 12 full-time nurses and contracted 10 
physicians in 2015 specifically to tend to workers’ health. These personnel were assigned to perform 
service at Xinyi, Aiguo, Linsen, Guoguang, and Da’an branches.
For employees involved in hi-rise work activities, the Company has deployed six i-med systems 
at local customer centers to perform blood pressure measurement and monitor employees’ health 
before work, and hence minimize chances of occupational hazard.Hiring of Full-Time Physicians and Nurses

assisted to apply for verification at the local municipal/county/city authority, in accordance with 
Act for Protecting Worker of Occupational Accidents.
The Company encountered 18 cases of occupational hazard in 2015; 2 of which had occurred during 
work while 16 had occurred when commuting. We manage risks at the source, making sure that 
construction risks are within control as early as the design stage. The line construction management 
system has been added with remarks to highlight high-risk operations along with risk assessment 
information. The system was launched in March 2015, giving workers the effective means to identify 
risks and take precautions.
All high-risk operations are subject to approval. Workers are also required to take site pictures with 
handheld devices and upload them to the monitoring system, so that precautionary measures can 
be identified and taken to prevent falls, oxygen deficiency etc. To promote employee’s awareness 
and skills on safety and health, we organized 200 training sessions and received 8,381 enrollments 
in 2015.Reducing Occupational Hazards
Occupational Hazard/Safety Competition
The Company has established a set of “Work Safety Competition Guidelines” as an encouragement to 
complying with work safety and preventing accidents. Under the guidelines, accidents may include: traffic 
accidents occurred while commuting, for which an occupational injury leave of one day or above has been 
taken; injury, death or damage of property suffered by employee or others while performing duty or caused by 
Chunghwa Telecom’s facilities; and damage caused to Chunghwa Telecom’s property while performing duty.
All employees each year are reviewed by the occupational safety unit of the respective institution. Once the 
assessment results have been approved by the Occupational Safety Committee, employees will be rewarded 
for the level of safety they have exhibited, according to the terms of the work safety competition.* Injury rate (IR) = Total number of injuries x 200,000/ Number of hours worked by all employees

closely related. In order to reduce climate related cost and risk in value chain and evaluate the result of 
voluntary carbon reduction measures, Chunghwa Telecom initiated “Greenhouse Gas Inventory” in 2008.
Chunghwa Telecom’s initial carbon management goals were to “reduce greenhouse gas emission to 2007 
levels by 2012,” which it had achieved ahead of schedule in 2011 due to proper control.
Assuming an annual growth of 2% for 4G and mobile communication services, the Company will 
inevitably be required to install additional communication equipment, which consume more power and 
emit more greenhouse gases. In view of this development, we have revised and set a new greenhouse gas 
target in 2013, which is to:
The total greenhouse gas emission is 834,745.37 t-CO 2e in 2015, including CO 2, CH 4, N 2O, HFCs, PFCs 
and SF 6. As a comprehensive telecom carrier, the major energy source consumed by Chunghwa 
Telecom is electricity, which is classified as Scope II (purchased electricity) gas emission and 
accounted for 96.9% of total gas emission. Scope 1 gas emission is normally sourced from general 
greenhouse gas emission such as offices and accounted for 3.1 % of total gas emission.Chunghwa Telecom has set our goals to becoming a sustainable “Green enterprise,” and thus 
incorporates environmental issues as part of business operation and management. We hope to play a 
more proactive role in issues such as energy and climate change. By improving energy efficiency and 
exploring environmental friendly products and services, we are confident of our potential to inspire a 
new generation of low-carbon industries.
Effective Control of Greenhouse Gas Emission
Benchmarking 2012 GHG emission standard, control the annual growth of GHG emission to no more than 2%. 
Note: GHG inventories and certification accords with ISO 14064-1 standard, and the value of Global warming 
potential is referred to IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007). All the data are certified by SGS-Taiwan.Risk and Opportunity for Climate Change

Chunghwa Telecom supports green transportation as part of green living. For public interests, 
we sponsored NT$1.85 million to the creation of YouBike station at the corner of Xinyi Road and 
Hangzhou South Road. Our sponsorship to the 50 YouBike parking lots not only provides citizens 
with greater convenience, but also conveys the importance of protecting the environment and 
encourages employees to support green and low-carbon transports.
Chunghwa Telecom has also discussion in 2013 about carbon footprints associated with employees’ 
business travels, given the issue’s increasing popularity around the world. Boundaries have been 
set at “Scope 3,” as specified by World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), 
while emission was calculated based on mileage.Green Transportation for Green Living

kg-CO 2e 98,842.7The Company’s scope 3 emission in 2015 was 263,495 kg-CO 2e. 
Emission from employees’ business travels was calculated based 
on the two main forms of transportation: high speed rail and 
airplane. On a long-term perspective, the Company is planning 
to include consumers’ impacts into scope 3 calculation so that the 
greenhouse gas inventory system may produce a more complete 
picture.91Growing demand for telecom services has forced us to install additional 
equipment, which makes it rather difficult to control increases in the 
use of power. Nevertheless, we pursue different measures from the 
energy saving in our own buildings as the starting point. Owing to a 
series of effective controls, we were able to reduce power consumption 
by 282 million kWh (27.87%) by the end of 2015, reducing greenhouse 
gas emission by 14,172 t-CO 2e compared to 2007. This effective control 
of power usage was achieved through a combination of enhanced 
environmental sustainability management system and closer 
monitoring of telecommunication equipment power usage.
Driven by our care towards environmental sustainability and support 
for the government’s renewable energy initiatives, Chunghwa Telecom 
purchased 2 million kWh of green power in 2015, making us the 
nation’s fifth largest procurer. We will continue our support in 2016, 
and help realize a cleaner future through action.

Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) was raised by international corporation investors, and they started to 
invite companies to reply CDP questionnaire since 2003, in order to understand how enterprises face 
and deal with carbon issue.
In response to the concerns of the international institutional investors over the information on carbon 
and reduction of Chunghwa Telecom, Chunghwa Telecom adopted the world café mode, which is the 
only telecommunication service provider of Taiwan that has participated in CPD for several years 
consecutively. Personnel in different functions were invited to a cross-function/level study for positive 
response to CDP questionnaire. Further to the positive feedback from the questionnaire that show 
the areas dictated for corrective action, this also helps us to set up an objective for carbon reduction. 
Indeed, this is the vital function beyond the answers of carbon reduction in the questionnaire.Annually Report to Carbon Disclosure ProjectBenchmarking 2012 electricity usage standard, control the annual growth of electricity usage to no more than 2%.
Vnit: 10,000 kWh92Chunghwa Telecom places great emphasis on the energy efficiency of our data centers, and 
is currently implementing energy conservation measures on telecommunication data centers 
(including IDCs). The Ankang Data Center, for example, obtained its green certification in 2013, 
while the new IDC located in Banqiao is also expected to attain its green building certification 
in 2016. All future data centers will be featuring our proprietary iEN smart energy management 
system, which is our scientific approach towards reducing energy, carbon and thereby protecting 
the environment.
With regards to renewable energy sources, the Company 
currently has 213.8kWp of photovoltaic capacity, 
and plans to develop wind power with a capacity of 
26.6kWp for use in multiple data centers.
The Banqiao IDC uses small amounts of solar energy, 
given its space layout and construction cost. Apart 
from that, solar energy is used mostly in remote areas, 
small IDCs, and telecom data centers in combination 
with ordinary power supply. Solar power and wind 
power are currently unsuitable for telecommunication 
applications due to concerns with system design and 
space layout. However, the Company will consider 
using renewable energy source for large IDC projects 
in the future.

Electricity Consumption of IDCs93Water usage at Chunghwa Telecom is mostly for domestic purpose. Apart from bathroom use, air 
conditioner cooling accounts for another major water use. Given the ongoing increase in business 
activities and manpower, there is limited room for water reduction besides recovery of rainwater 
and cooling water.
We have identified water resources as part of our management focus, and introduced a number of 
initiatives to improve water efficiency, such as: water conservation measures, centralized water bill 
management, and water-saving goals. Apart from adding a new water leakage detection feature, 
we have also incorporated water usage monitoring into our environmental sustainability system. 
Data collected from these two functions is analyzed and managed. Other conservation measures 
such as recycling and reuse of rainwater and domestic effluents are also being implemented on an 
on-going basis.
Currently, Chunghwa Telecom’s annual business growth is 2%, we therefore benchmarking 2012 
water usage standard, control the annual growth of water usage to no more than 2% and promote 
water saving measures accordingly, including:
Started from 2007, Chunghwa Telecom initiated water conservation measures by including water 
resources management into EARTH system, while registering centralized water bill payment 
through EARTH’s “water bill management” function to reduce printing of water bills.Through 
the information interface, managers can search, generate trend charts and report forms, provide 
exception reports to avoid mistakes in billing and meter reading. Managers can also review the 
situation of water use, reduce expenses in water, and improve efficiency of management.
We have scheduled a five-year plan to enhance the effectiveness of water recycling and reusing. 
In the plan, we are expected to establish underground raft foundation water collection system to 
collect clean rainwater from rooftop and ground. Meanwhile, we also initiated recycle of cool-
condensed water project for office air-conditioner.The Plan and Objective of Water Resources Management
Recycling of Water ResourcesNote: We reclassified and recalculated domestic water and air conditioning water in 2014 for more accurate 
presentation and more effective control of water resources. The amount of water recycled in 2015 had reduced 
significantly due to severe drought, which was believed to have been caused by climate change.Tap Water (ton)

Chunghwa Telecom Hostels provide accommodation for employees business or leisure travel. In response to 
environmental protection and personal hygiene, the hostels do not provide disposal consumption goods and 
towel, and implement energy saving measures such as solar water heater, air conditioning heat pump and LED 
lightings. Environmental friendly and tidiness has become the employees‘ favorite travel accommodation. 7 
hostels had been certified as Environmental Friendly Accommodati on in 2015.
In response to Hotel Carbon Measurement Initiative (HCMI 1.0) formulated by World Travel & Tourism Council 
(WTTC) and International Tourism Partnership (ITP) , we introduced “carbon footprint calculator of hotel rooms” 
in Siziwan hostel, along with the combination of iEN system to manage the use of facilities and electricity in the 
hostel and construct comprehensive power monitor and room management model, so as to reach maximum 
energy and water saving efficiency.
Since 2001, we have been combining customers’ bills and mailing multiple bills of the same address in one 
envelope, which not only makes filing easier for customers but a lso helps protect the environment.
The Company introduced electronic bills in 2005, saving 410 million sheets of paper each year and was 
estimated to have saved 37,847 trees, as 7,494 tons of carbon by the end of 2015. It was a good example of 
how the Company had satisfied customers’ needs while at the same time contribute to the mitigation of 
global warming.Green Environmental Hostel

telecom technology, so that inheritance of culture, extension of education, promotion of industry and upgrade 
of arts and intellectual can be connected in the universe of internet, and everyone can be benefited from digital 
technology despite their age, social standing, geographical loc ation and education, creating infinite hope. 
Based on the characteristics of ICT industry and the spirit of “value is where the responsibility lies”, Chunghwa 
Telecom penetrates into the communities in Taiwan; with the objective of “shorten digital difference and create 
digital opportunity”, Chunghwa observes the trend of digital difference and put forward solutions to facilitate 
society innovation and digital inclusion.Connect Hope Technology
4G Smart City - Accessibility Applications
Chunghwa Telecom is currently a participant in MOEA’s 4G Smart City Subsidy Program; it has three main 
focuses for building a smart city and leading the new smart lifestyle, which are: “Convenience,” “LOHAS,” and 
“Friendliness.” The Friendliness is mainly concerned with “accessibility applications.” It involves the use of 4G 
technology to create a living environment that is caring, friendly, and accessible to people with disability.
In 2015, this application had already been implemented at locations such as Qingguang Commercial Zone, the 
section between MRT Zhonghsan Elementary School Station and Technology Development Association for the 
Disabled, and the section between Tamkang University bus stop and Taipei Resource Center for the Visual 
Impairment. When persons with visual disability walk along these roads, their cellphones will notify them 
of the surrounding environment, road condition, or even read out restaurant menus and descriptions to help 
them shop through ears. The Company has made plans to bring accessibility to 9 MRT stations, 3 streets, and 1 
campus in greater Taipei region in 2016. These measures will make life easier for the socially disadvantaged and 
help build the city’s friendly image.100In the era of technology advancement, the “digital gap” has triggered inequality in education and 
employment opportunity. Chunghwa Telecom focused its social investment in “narrowing the digital 
gap” and “creation of digital opportunity”, given the specific nature and the core competence of 
data communication of the industry we are in. In addition, we also spare no effort in the advocacy of 
“corporate volunteers” to participate in community service, and proactively assist the communities in 
creating digital opportunity.
Help disabilities and economically disadvantaged persons to 
use telecom services through ICT technology and favorable 
rates; develop ICT equipment and provide the same to the 
disabilities thereby improve their life quality, education and 
job opportunities. In addition, with the development of ICT 
services, we also assist in improving the life quality of people 
with chronicle disease and aged people who need special care.Trouble-free communication use, life

Chunghwa Telecom believes “Taking from the society and contributing back to the society”. Being the 
largest telecom carrier in Taiwan, our network and services provided throughout Taiwan and remote 
islands shapes our self-demanding of contributing to the society. Over the years, by exerting our core 
competence, we continue to create values for society and help society overall to improve quality of life.
Quantification of Contribution of Social Investment
By referencing community investment evaluation mechanism of LBG (London Benchmark Group), 
Chunghwa Telecom conducts evaluation on the possible Community benefits and Business benefits 
before social investment is made. The quantification of contribution of social investment allows us to 
make reasonable resources allocation, while avoiding repetition. It helps our future decision-making and 
promotion of charity or sponsor activities.
Note: Calculation for service availability has been adjusted to: “Current year net cost” + “amount allocated from 
previous year” - “amount approved in previous year” since 2015 to more appropriately present the cost effectiveness 
of social investments. Therefore, the total amount of investment in 2015 lessened a little bit.

digital opportunity”, “assisting local industries”, “cultivation of community life”, and “keep local events on record” as 
the directions of its work, and enter the communities from the cultural, industrial, living, and education aspects to share 
the growth together with the communities.
The beauty of Taiwan lies in the 368 towns and districts that make up the nation. We believe each town and district to be 
unique in its own way, which is why we respect autonomy of our local offices and encourage them to take sustainable 
actions to the needs of local residents. Due to resource constraints, it is our goal to maximize our influence by exploring 
needs first before committing resources.
Since 2006, the foundation has been utilizing the core advantages of Chunghwa Telecom to develop “Digital Community” 
throughout the nation including offshore islands. This program provides local communities with computer classrooms 
and open space of information to assist people who are willing but lack the resources to learn. Unlike one-time donations, 
“Digital Community” is a long-term program thoughtfully structured from early planning, equipment deployment, to 
maintenance.
Each Digital Community is assigned a different purpose; they may be designed to cater for children of disadvantaged 
families, or to develop local business activities, or to serve local religious organizations. We have accumulated abundant 
experience from our long-term engagement with the beneficiaries; for this reason, Chunghwa Telecom Foundation 
continues to organize Digital Communication Meeting on a regular basis to facilitate exchange of experience between 
different project groups. In 2015, we organized a special “educational tour” that encouraged local residents to step out of 
their comfort zone and engage directly with residents of Jiaxian, Kaohsiung. By seeing and experiencing personally the 
beauties of others, we hope to inspire growth within the participants themselves.
We have long accompanied local residents and heeded their needs through active interaction. Relationship between 
the Company and local communities has been founded on the basis of mutual trust and fairness, which we hope to 
expand and realize further growth within each community. By the end of 2015, we have established a total of 76 Digital 
Communities; our efforts will endure long into the future and become a part of the local community.
Digital Good Neighbors, New Cloud Vision
Digital Message to Home
Digital Communities are being used not just for computer classroom and information exchange, but have 
also become a gathering place for new immigrants. In 2015, Chunghwa Telecom Foundation introduced 
tablet courses to the Digital Community program, which gave new immigrants a chance to learn tablet 
PCs. The program organizer also made publications of new immigrants’ home culture, thus giving them 
a familiar sight of home and allowing them to pass on cultural legacy to their children.103Youth Training Scheme is a program organized between Chunghwa Telecom Foundation and Department 
of Radio & Television, National Chengchi University that encourages young adults to make real changes 
in life, step outside of usual circle to experience different things, and learn about themselves and the 
environment they grow up in through a different perspective. During summer vacations, university 
students were invited to provide service for 15-20 days at various Digital Communities. They were 
encouraged to apply what they learned at the local community and at the same time capture local stories 
on camera.
The 7th “Youth Training Scheme” program received entry from 48 university students, who were 
assigned to perform service and capture stories at 24 Digital Communities. These students came from 
different backgrounds, schools and departments, and had devoted themselves to community services 
by contributing their own specialties such as storytelling, wall arts, creative craft, photography tutoring, 
cooking lesson, elderly exercise, event recording, journalism and editing class, weaving/dyeing 
assistance, translation assistance, tour assistance, tribal family photo-taking, remodeling of old houses, 
and life exploration courses. In the meantime, they captured real and motivating stories through cameras.
The purpose of this program is to share with the public on how the young people see and perceive 
the stories around them, and in turn motivate others to re-think their connection with the environment 
and contribute their part. In 2016, we plan to organize a “Story of Falling in love with Taiwan-Photo 
Exhibition” at selected coffee shops throughout the nation, during which experts will be invited to 
discuss with participating students to inspire new ideas of how we may care for our local environment.

Connected Resources for Mutual Benefit
Digital Community enable local information exchange at remote locations. Over the course of our efforts, 
we saw the sparks and possibilities that local residents have exhibited, and hence decided to connect 
them through the foundation, thereby allow community residents to express voices and seek solutions 
over a common platform.
Performance art gives children the room to express their imagination, which was why we invited Paper 
Windmill Theatre to perform at 7 elementary schools located in remote areas such as Dongao (Yilan) and 
Gaoliao (Hualien). We joined Taiwan Toy Library Association and Homemakers Union in organizing 
reading courses at seven locations; we invited award-winning singers to Yongle (Pingtung) where they 
exchanged music talents with local clubs and bands in a successful concert; and last but not least, we 
bridged support across communities with our Digital Community Program. These accomplishments 
made us believe that brighter future can be achieved by working with others.

first-hand the difference between knowing and doing. They put their knowledge to the test, witnessed the 
power of teamwork, and returned home with a broader vision.
Jin-Ta Chan from Department of Radio & Television and Zi-Hao Lin from Department of Journalism, 
National Chengchi University were assigned to service at a Paiwan Tribe reserve called “Xinlaiyi.” The two 
of them started out by interviewing elders about tribal history, and as they astonished locals with the quality 
portraits they took, they were then asked to take family and ID photos. Photo taking became a major part of 
their day-to-day activities afterwards, and as they watched the locals dressed up in traditional clothes and 
wore proud smiles everyday, they started to appreciate the meaning behind their trip. “Many elders lost 
their photos after the previous Typhoon disaster; therefore they consider photo-taking a meaningful thing to 
do. We, too, felt happy seeing them smile the way they did, even for such a little thing as pressing a camera.”
After this trip, they received news that one of the elders whom they had taken photo for had passed away. 
They were asked by locals to edit the photo they took for funeral, and this was the first time they felt the 
passing of life and a deeper meaning to “photography.”“To accomplish the task, I had to immerse myself in the local culture and to discover 
what local people need, and to see things from different perspectives.”
“Through photos, we involved ourselves in his life and gave him our blessing for his journeys 
ahead. Fragile as life may be, we can always offer a bit of decency and warmth to the other.”

In 2015, Chunghwa Telecom has established 62 sites for accessibility to telecommunication services 
in supporting the government for protecting the fundamental right of the people in communication 
with concrete action.By utilizing our expertise in telecom technology, we hope that everyone shares the advantage 
of technology despite their wealth, social status or geographical location, thereby achieving the 
objective of shortening digital difference and creating digital opportunities. We also contributed 
resources in developing products and services to meet the needs of the disabled, so as to achieving 
their rights of enjoying the universe of digital technology.
Problems
•
•The topography of different rural zones are vary significantly and far away, which makes the 
maintenance of the telecommunication systems difficult.
There is a higher probability that natural disasters will cause damage to the telecommunication 
facilities, and the cost of maintenance will not be lower than the cost of installation.

Chunghwa Telecom has supported the education and showed its concern for the rural villages since 2009, 
after the turmoil left behind by Typhoon Morakot. We extend our service to the permanent settlement 
and newly developed communities in the disaster zone. Through the installation of visual technology of 
the Internet, we delivered the educational resources in the form of private tutorship to rural villages and 
the hands of the unfortunate. We hope to give the children of the next generation a learning environment 
with “safety, dignity, and hope”!

ParticipantsMethod108The Institute for Information Industry later joined HonDao Senior Citizen’s Welfare Foundation in organizing one 
Chungyang Festival event in Chiayi followed by one family recreational event in Xinzhuang Civil Sports Center, 
during which senior citizens aged 55 and above were interviewed and invited to experience the App. During 
the two events, the App was promoted to 400 people, of which 71 had tried to use the App. More than 80% of 
interviewed elders were satisfied with the App’s overall impression, interface, and functionality.Senior Citizens App
“Senior Citizens App” was the first application developed by Chunghwa Telecom and 
Institute for Information Industry that specializes in addressing the needs of the elderly 
population. The App contains useful features including phone assistance, contact list, caller 
announcement, weather inquiry, health reminder, emergency contact, photo sharing, and 
video streaming. Through this App, we hope to make smartphones and tablet PCs more 
user friendly to elders and narrow their digital divide.
Voice-Based Personal Assistance App for the Visually Impaired
In 2013, we launched a “Voice-based Personal Assistance App” that was specifically designed 
for the visually impaired. The App incorporates image, voice, reading, and lifestyle functions 
to assist the visually impaired and elders in many difficulties they encounter in life. By the 
end of 2015, the App had received 10,676 downloads, making it one of the most convenient 
and useful personal assistant to the visually impaired.
Result at Present
Result at PresentIn 2014, the iPhone version was released in four languages, offering 30,000 audiobooks and the ability to 
recognize cash notes of five different countries. Currently, there are 200 volunteers in Taiwan providing service 
over the cloud to help users identify various items in life.
In 2015, the iPhone version was added with new features including Internet surfing, 4G mobile learning, hand 
gesture control, and bookmark. It was the first application to support NCC’s “Accessible Communication Action 
Plan” and incorporate audio description of images, films, baseball games and other digital contents. It provides 
the visually impaired with great accessibility to high-speed broadband and digital learning environment.Ƕ

Ƕ
A 4G-based smart guidance feature will be added to bring live video assistance and Beacon assistance 
to the visually impaired. Using 4G live video assistance, volunteers can see for the visually impaired 
and help them resolve problems such as shopping and reading without having to be physically 
present. The App and volunteers’ assistance have enabled visually impaired persons to experience 
the world in different ways.Future
Target
We hope to complete user experience tests in greater details on 400 elders, and use our findings to 
optimize the Senior Citizens App and develop long-distance companion features by combining video 
calls and 4G technology. Doing so would give elders a broader means to interact with the outside 
world.
Chunghwa Telecom plans to reach the elderly population through government and non-government 
organizations such as Social and Family Affairs Administration, HonDao Senior Citizen’s Welfare 
Foundation, Taipei Xiaocheng Residents Association, and Sanmu Riguang Residents Association. It 
expects to visit 10 community centers and participate in three major charity events, during which an 
exclusive booth will be established to market, promote, and allow users to experience the App.Future
Target
109The automated voice donation system developed by Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories continues to 
prove helpful to charity, social welfare, cultural, educational, and environmental protection institutions, 
as it provides donors with a more convenient means of donation using cellphones, and has proven to 
raise more donations than conventional methods. Donors simply need to pick up their cellphones, dial 
the number and follow instructions as prompted by the voice system to contribute care to those in need. 
This service had raised NT$721 million in donations in 2015.Automated Voice Donations
QR Code-Charity Donation
In 2013, the Company introduced a QR code-based mobile payment service that allows users to make 
donations more conveniently simply by scanning the appropriate QR Code. This feature enables funds to 
be raised through a multitude of channels other than convenience stores and websites, while at the same 
time reduces the amount of manual works. Since its initial launch until the end of 2015, this service was 
used 401 times and raised NT$179,028 in donations.Innovation Creates Employment Opportunity
Chunghwa Telecom has engaged in long-term cooperation with the Resources Center for the Blind at 
Tamkang University, and has established the EYE Social Innovative Call Center in 2011. The joint effort 
led to the unveil of the first “Total solution” in Taiwan, including the research and development of 
the computer assisted telephone system for the visually impaired, improvement and the training and 
supervision of talents and develop the skills of the telephone customer service personnel in responding 
to the needs of the visually impaired.
In 2015, the Company completed an upgrade for Taipei City’s 1999 hotline, making it user-friendly to 
the visually impaired. This upgrade included: a real-time notification system, a three-way call feature 
with voice recording, English/Japanese service, verbal abuse referral feature, call duration reminder, 
health regulation inquiry feature, and quick link to service sub-categories. These upgrades were made 
to improve the scope and efficiency of services delivered by the customer service personnel.
By the end of 2015, “Total Solutions” had provided 9 satisfaction surveyors for Chunghwa Telecom 
and 12 customer service personnel for Taipei City’s 1999 hotline, who process more than 11,525 calls 
each month. One of the surveyors for the visually impaired had even passed internal assessment and 
became the head of customer phone service unit.•
