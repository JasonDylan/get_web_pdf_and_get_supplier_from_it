Everywhere It Matters  .™ 
1A Message from Ecolab  
Chairman, President and CEO
Operating our business with a focus on 
sustainability serves a powerful purpose  .  
It directs our attention to the opportunities 
we have to advance economic progress, environmental stewardship and social  
well-being for all whom we serve  . 
Today, Ecolab employs more than 26,000 people and manufactures cleaning and anti-
microbial products in 55 plants worldwide  . 
Our 14,500-member sales-and-service team provides personalized customer service with a fleet of more than 13,000
 vehicles  . 
Clearly, we have a significant opportunity to 
further reduce our environmental impact  . 
In 2010, we made progress under our three sustainability principles: 
y    Economic progress: We continued to grow in a difficult economy, which allowed for continued investment in our people and in research and development, both critical to our ability to serve customers and further strengthen 
our company  . 
y    Environmental stewardship: We reduced global water consumption by 
4 .4 percent, 
global disposed waste by 18 percent and global effluent water by
 2 .4 percent per 
metric ton of shipped product  . In the U  .S ., 
we reduced carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2e) emissions by 9 .13 percent per 
dollar sales from 2009, resulting in a  
15 .4 percent total reduction from our 
2006 baseline  .
y   Social responsibility: We increased our ethical sourcing spend by 20 percent, improved worker safety and contributed 
more than $5  .4 million through our 
Foundation to local communities  . 
While our own progress is critical, we can have an even greater impact through the more than one million customer 
locations we serve  . B y providing products 
and services that enable our customers to optimize their water and energy use and reduce waste streams, our impact is 
multiplied exponentially  . In 2010, for example: 
y   With select customers, we began testing our Aquanomic
TM laundry system, which 
uses innovative wash formulas and low-temperature chemistry to reduce 
water and energy consumption  . These 
initial trials demonstrated the system’s potential to reduce customers’ water and energy use by up to 40 percent while 
providing clean, white and soft results  . 
Following this testing phase, Ecolab plans to roll out the Aquanomic system more 
broadly in 2012  . 
 y    For healthcare institutions, Ecolab’s new 
PROTECTTM and EnCompassTM programs 
demonstrated the potential to improve patient, environmental and staff safety while also supporting their sustainability 
goals  . Driving pr oduct and process 
standardization to maximize efficiency and reduce waste, these programs delivered reductions of up to 86 percent in water 
use and 74 percent in chemical use  . 
 
y    Our ongoing investment in solids 
detergent technology yielded environmental dividends for our 
customers  . W e introduced Solid Power® XL 
for dishmachines, which uses 80 percent less packaging and thus reduces fossil fuel requirements for packaging and 
product distribution  . We also introduced 
solids technology as part of our OptiPro™ Instrument Reprocessing Program for 
hospitals  . T he benefits: substantially less 
packaging and improved worker safety as the small, lightweight solids replace large, 
heavy drums of liquid detergent  .  You’ll see other examples throughout  
this report  . 
While we have made progress, the growing resource challenges ahead will require a continued evolution of our approach 
to sustainability  . In 2 010, we began an 
exciting exploration to imagine how we can advance beyond just “reducing” resource consumption to “producing” an overall 
positive impact on the planet  .  
Through this exploration, we aim to achieve more positive economic, social and environmental outcomes for all to whom we are accountable: our associates, customers, 
communities and shareholders  . Making 
sustainability core to our business is the 
right thing to do  . And it is critic al to our 
mission to make the world cleaner, safer and healthier — today and in the years  
to come  . 
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
By providing products and services 
that enable our customers to 
optimize their water and energy use and reduce waste streams, our 
impact is multiplied exponentially  .

business focus — and it is reflected in 
how we manage our daily operations  . 
We build sustainability objectives into our facilities, manufacturing, shipping

10 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010Reducing Our Carbon Footprint
Ecolab is committed to reducing our 
carbon footprint  . T o help us manage risks 
from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
and identify cost-effective reduction 
opportunities, we joined the U  .S . 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Climate Leaders Program in 2005  . T hough 
it was announced in late 2010 that Climate Leaders is being dissolved, we wanted to acknowledge the progress we’ve made in meeting the following goals that we established within the program:
y   Develop a U  .S . in ventory of the six  
major greenhouse gases emitted by  
our U  .S . f acilities  .
y   Report our progress annually against  
our goals  .
y   Meet an aggressive GHG reduction goal 
of reducing our U  .S . GHG emis sions by  
20 percent per dollar sales from 2006  
to 2012  .
We completed our U  .S . in ventory in 2006  . 
Our U  .S . GHG emis sions from our direct and 
indirect energy uses over the past decade have totaled approximately 200,000 metric 
tons annually  .
We began reporting our annual progress 
in 2007  . In 2 010, we continued to refine 
and develop energy and GHG reduction 
programs for our facilities  . W e are working 
to move our sales-and-service associates into more fuel-efficient vehicles and are 
mapping better vehicle service routes  . 
When feasible, we are switching to using 
less GHG-intensive fuels as well  . To date, 
we have achieved a GHG reduction of 
approximately 15  .4 perc ent, moving closer 
to our Climate Leader 2012 goals  . To achieve our 20 percent reduction goal by 2012, we are focusing on our two largest GHG emissions categories — fleet ground transport and our facilities (manufacturing, headquarters, research 
and development)  .
In 2009, Ecolab expanded its GHG inventories beyond the scope of our 
U .S .-only Climat e Leaders reporting 
to benchmark data on global GHG 
emissions  . W e’ve begun tracking data on 
one group of our European fleets and two 
facilities in Europe  . F or 2010, emissions 
from our tracked global manufacturing 
operations totaled 25,000 metric tons  . 
We continue to see positive trends that indicate a reduction of GHG emissions in 
those three pilot tracking areas  .
Meanwhile, data on U  .S . busine ss travel 
and global manufacturing emissions 
also are being tracked  . Emissions from 
U .S . busine ss travel (including air travel, 
personal vehicles and rental vehicles used for business) increased to more than 12,000 metric tons due to increased 
business activity  .More information on both of these emission areas will be reported as part of our Carbon Disclosure Project submission in fall 2011.Ecolab facilities are committed to  
implementing initiatives designed to help  
reduce our environmental impact across the globe  .

OUR OPERATIONS
Improving Our Fleet
In 2010, we implemented fleet policy changes 
globally in an effort to continue to reduce 
our overall greenhouse gas emissions  . W e 
introduced changes modeled after best practices in Europe and other regions where we drive smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles 
when it is feasible  . 
Specific 2010 fleet highlights include:
y   In Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), a new fleet policy is replacing existing vehicles with more fuel-efficient ones over 
the next four-year replacement cycle  .  
The new vehicles are expected to provide a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide (CO
2) emissions by 2015  .
y   We are providing more fuel-efficient vehicle models for sales-and-service associates to choose when ordering fleet 
vehicles in North America  .
y   In the U  .S ., w e now have more than  
20 percent of the fleet in U  .S . EP A-
certified SmartWay and hybrid vehicles  . y   In Brazil, the fleet uses ethanol biofuels in its flex fuel models and continues to have 
very low fleet emissions  . 
y   In Australia, we are investigating the feasibility of moving portions of our  fleet to more compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas  
(LPG) options  .
y   Global positioning software (GPS) and other navigational tools were introduced into our fleet-planning process to help map the most efficient routes for our 
global service vehicles  .
y   99 .8 per cent of our U  .S . flee t drivers 
completed eco-driving training to minimize fuel consumption and improve 
their driving habits  .Improving Our Manufacturing  
Footprint
Ecolab has been striving to reduce the 
impact of our operations for years by 
setting internal goals  . In 2 009, we outlined 
our biggest commitment to continuous improvement yet: We pledged to reduce global water consumption, disposed waste and effluent water from our manufacturing operations by 18 percent per metric ton of shipped product from 2009 to 2015.
We benchmarked our goal using 2009 data  . 
For all metrics in 2010 — GHG, waste, water and effluent water — we achieved reductions 
in line with our goals when normalized  .
Please note: The historic data (2006 – 2009) was updated resulting from a change in methodology (expansion of scope is the largest change). Notably, Ecolab broadened its definition of “operational control” from years past to include leased facilities where it does not have direct control of the utility bills. Historic year reporting has been adjusted in accordance with the GHG Protocol accounting standard.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010     13OUR OPERATIONS
Measuring Our  
Sustainability Progress
Ecolab strives to use resources efficiently 
in our manufacturing operations and to reduce waste to improve our environmental 
performance  . W e invest in improving 
energy efficiency and conservation in our 
operations  . W e also minimize and seek to 
eliminate the release of pollutants that may cause damage to our planet’s air, water, land 
or inhabitants  .
We continuously monitor the environmental, health and safety compliance standards of our manufacturing facilities around the 
globe  . In ternal and third-party audits lend 
integrity to the process and lead us toward  
a more sustainable business model  .
Expanding Ecolab’s ISO 14001 Profile
The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) 14001 environmental management system is a global standard for preventing pollution, conforming to legal standards, minimizing impact on the environment and continuously improving 
environmental performance  . In 2 010, an 
important milestone was reached with the certification of ISO 14001 for Ecolab plants in 
Toronto and St  . P aul . T hey were added to our 
European plants, which have been certified 
since 2005 (recertified in 2011)  . Certification 
for additional Ecolab plants is scheduled for 
completion by the end of 2012  .
EHS Compliance Auditing and  Capital Expenditures
To enhance environmental health and 
safety compliance in our manufacturing operations, North American facilities are audited periodically by a third-party consultant  . Similarly , in Europe and Asia 
Pacific, an outside Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) 
consultant audits our plants  . 
Additionally, audits are performed when facilities are acquired, and our property and casualty insurers conduct fire and worker safety assessments and pressure vessel 
certifications at Ecolab facilities  . T hese 
auditing programs help us improve our  
EHS performance  .
Releases to the Air/Environment
As required by the U  .S . Emer gency Planning 
and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), Ecolab facilities make information available about releases of EPA-listed chemicals to 
the environment  . T he primary chemicals 
reportable are formula components that 
evaporate during production  .Remediation Sites
Ecolab works hard to avoid pollution in 
our operations  . W e continue to work in 
cooperation with regulatory authorities for 
successful closure of the few sites where Ecolab has been named as a “potentially 
responsible party  .”
In 2010, Ecolab spent approximately $1 million worldwide on environmental 
remediation  . Our environmental remediation 
expenses have related primarily to two categories: businesses acquired by Ecolab and accounted for in connection with the transaction, or historic businesses divested 
years ago  .
Safe Transportation of Goods
Ecolab works with national and international 
agencies to help craft future standards regarding the safe transport of goods and to ensure that Ecolab products are delivered 
safely to our customers  .

Operations Highlights
y  In an Ecolab manufacturing facility in 
California, a Lean Six Sigma project 
resulted in daily savings of more than 6,500 gallons of water, and at the same time reduced water acquisition and 
disposal costs  . T he analysis team used 
various water flow and filtration methods to achieve the savings, and is repeating the 
process across several Ecolab plants  .
y  A process was established at our 
Greensboro, N  .C . plan t to reduce solid 
product scrap, cut the costs of purchasing new materials to make blocks, and cut the 
cost of disposal of imperfect blocks  . T he 
new process grinds up the product blocks to be reintroduced into the manufacturing process rather than sending them to a 
local landfill  . From March 2010 to February 
2011, 263,000 pounds of material were reworked using the new process, saving $320,000 in material and waste  
removal costs  .
y  Ecolab is working to reduce the amount of 
shrink film used to package products for 
shipping  . In our Greensboro, N  .C ., plan t, 
shrink film use was reduced by 2,530 lbs  . 
in 2010 by converting to a thinner-gauge 
film . In 2011, the film savings initiative will 
be expanded to multiple plants  .y  One packaging project eliminated more 
than 450,000 lbs  . o f corrugated packing 
material used each year to ship bottles 
of liquid hand soap  . Impr oving the cap 
covering the bottle pump and optimizing  case fit allowed the reduction in packing 
material  .
y  By better controlling chemical use and 
raising the mean pH for a treatment pit 
to 8 .5 at our Joliet, Ill  . plant, a local Lean 
Six Sigma team was able to reduce the 
facility’s use of sodium hydroxide by 87 percent and reduce its use of sulfuric acid 
by 45 percent  . T he reduction in chemical 
use saves $260,000 annually  . In addition,  
since sodium hydroxide contains residual fluoride, the reduced use of sodium hydroxide to treat our waste water reduces 
the fluoride in our effluent  .
Raw Material Guidance Council
We continually make the environment, human health and safety key factors in our choice of raw materials for products 
and customer solutions  . Our R aw Material 
Guidance Council meets quarterly to 
manage and monitor raw materials  . Glob al 
representatives from our regulatory, procurement, quality, research and development, sustainability and other 
functions analyze raw materials  . T he 
council provides data and guidance to internal product development teams and our suppliers as they work on new cleaning 
solutions and redesign existing ones  . The Ecolab Cleaning Caddy’s  smart 
design lowers total cleaning costs and utilizes concentrated packaging to reduce environmental impact. It was piloted with customers in 2010 and continues to find new market applications.Building Sustainability 
into Our Products
Product Design Approach
In 2010, we continued our journey to 
achieve optimal product performance within the context of our sustainability 
principles and goals  . W e make sound 
product formulation decisions based on scientific evidence of both product performance and sustainability 
performance  . W e believe in 
positive impact by design  . 
For us, compliance is only the first step in building sustainability into the product design lifecycle —  all the way to recycling or  
re-using waste  .
Awards and Recognition
The 2010 Maplecroft Climate 
Innovation Index ranked Ecolab 39 out 
of 339 of the largest U  .S . c ompanies 
for climate-related innovation and 
carbon management  . T he rating is 
founded on public disclosures and direct engagement of shareholders and employees, and is based on five key areas of focus: Management, Mitigation, Emissions Reductions, Innovation  
and Adaptation  .

for customers to use  .
*Chart revised in 2010 to reflect North American call 
volume per $1 million North American net sales from 2006 – 2010. Previous years’ reports reflected North American call volume per $1 million global net sales. This change was made to ensure accuracy as Ecolab’s business expands globally; call volume is now tracked relative to net sales only in the specific territory in which calls were received.MSDS Revised to Aid Customers
In 2010, New Zealand and Australia joined 
our North American and Latin American businesses in offering a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) that provides customers both product concentrate and dilute 
information  . A common MSDS system 
supports our efforts to create a consistent approach for managing data and hazard 
communication globally  .  
To date, Ecolab has launched the MSDS system in nearly 40 countries and produces nearly 25,000 new or updated 
sheets annually  . Reduced Packaging Equals  
Reduced Waste
We continue to lead the industry 
with innovative product designs that significantly reduce the necessary 
packaging  . 
Our percentage of recycled plastic use has declined as we continue to favor flexible 
plastics over rigid plastic containers  . 
Flexible plastic packaging is less conducive to incorporating recycled plastic, but has a 
positive net impact on landfills  .
Ecolab offers a complimentary drum 
recycling program to its contiguous U  .S . 
customers  . During a r ecent 12-month 
period, over 188,000 drums were recycled 
by our customers through this program  . 
Recycling these drums reduced Ecolab’s 
need for nearly 2  .4 million pounds of  
virgin resin  .U.S. MSDS Distribution

Managing Our Supply Chain
Ethical and Environmental  
Sourcing Standards
Our Ethical and Environmental Sourcing 
Standards represent a global supply chain initiative to require our direct suppliers to protect the health, safety and human rights 
of their associates  . S uppliers must meet 
standards regarding forced labor, child labor, health and safety in the workplace, fair pay, harassment in the workplace, diversity and ethics, and environmental 
policies  . W e require that our suppliers 
identify and act swiftly to eliminate any unacceptable conditions or practices in 
their facilities  . W e will not do business 
with suppliers who do not support the fundamental principles of human dignity and rights of workers to fair and equitable 
treatment  .Our supplier requirements are based on these international standards:
y 
   United Nations Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, which sets a common 
standard of achievement for all peoples and nations and represents a set of core 
international ethical standards  .
y   United Nations Convention on the  
Rights of the Child, which has been ratified by almost all member states in the United Nations and provides a framework for interpreting the best 
interests of the child  .
y   Conventions of the International Labour 
Organization, which sets international labor standards including Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work  . 
In 2010, we increased ethical sourcing spend covered by 20 percent and revised our ethical sourcing standards to include sections on ethics and environmental sustainability, and then distributed them to top suppliers in the chemical, packaging, equipment and contract manufacturer 
categories  .

prices  . Our S upplier Diversity Program 
is founded on the principles of fair and equitable business practices and social responsibility to the communities  
we serve  .
Ecolab continued to strengthen its supplier diversity program this year by overseeing the registration of diverse suppliers on its Supplier Diversity Portal and providing internal diversity 
education and training  .  In 2010, we also 
were active members in the following 
U .S . supplier div ersity organizations:
y   National Minority Supplier Development Council
y   Midwest Minority Supplier Development Council
y   Women’s Business Enterprise  
National Council (WBENC)
In 2010, our U  .S . pur chases from small 
businesses totaled approximately 
7 .4  percent of total spend, with new 
contracts for packaging and safety supplies awarded to diverse small 
businesses  .
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010     17OUR ASSOCIATES
Ecolab is a people business  . All that w e do depends on  
the men and women who daily invest their enthusiasm, 
skills and creativity in realizing our aspirations for economic progress, environmental stewardship and 
social responsibility — our three sustainability principles  . 
 
18 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010As a company, we have set ambitious goals  . 
Achieving them will require us to provide 
a workplace that inspires, empowers and values our people — a culture that supports 
all 26,000 associates in doing their best work  . 
In an ideal workplace — one where individuals feel they can perform their best work every day — associates have a sense that they 
belong  . They trust their ideas will be heard, 
their contributions appreciated and their 
interest in new opportunities welcomed  . 
Building on momentum from 2009, 
associate teams in the U  .S . and C anada 
developed plans designed to enhance 
engagement  . Among the 2,600 plans 
developed, the top three areas of  focus were: 
y  Rewards and recognition 
y  Work-life balance 
y  Being heard and supported Throughout the year, associates and their managers implemented their plans — and periodically recalibrated them based on 
assessments of their impact  .
Responding to the need expressed by associates for work-life balance, Ecolab 
introduced FlexWork  . FlexWork provides 
an array of tools, resources and education aimed at helping managers and associates devise flexible work options for balancing 
the many facets of their lives  . 
Managers point to improved productivity, as well as an attractive case for recruitment 
and retention  . Associates appreciate the 
ability to adjust schedules as demands at 
work and home change  . 
In addition, we implemented a peer-to-peer program to accelerate our journey toward a 
more inclusive culture  . L ed by 28 associates 
representing a cross-section of roles, business units and functions, our Inclusion Change Partners program aims to create a more inclusive culture at the grassroots 
level  . The idea is to inspire inclusive 
behaviors among enough associates to create a “tipping point,” at which change 
begins to occur across the broader culture  . Our strength has always  
been in our people  .Our Next Measure  
of Engagement  Is Set for 2011
We believe we are making progress 
toward a workplace that inspires, empowers and values associates — a culture that enables and engages associates to do their best work 
every day  . 
In 2011, we will track our progress against the baseline established in our first survey of associate engagement, conducted in the 
U .S . and C anada in 2009  . In 
addition to checking back with 
U .S . and C anadian associates, we 
will expand the survey to include associates in China, Japan, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand for 
the first time  . T his expansion  
will mark an important step toward our long-term goal to measure the engagement of all 
associates globally  .

by Ida C. Koran Trust
No single individual has had a more lasting 
influence on Ecolab than the company’s 
first associate, Ida C  . Koran  . Through her 
significant generosity, current associates and Ecolab retirees around the world have a place to turn when they face financial hardship due to disabilities, medical problems, catastrophic and/or unforeseen situations; when their children need financial assistance for education; and when they seek treatment for chemical 
dependency  .
In 2010, the Ida C  . Koran Trust’s student 
aid program provided nearly $1  .5 million 
to 90 new recipients and 205 renewing 
applicants  . T hey came from countries 
including Canada, Israel, Germany, Poland, China, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, the 
U .S . and Me xico .
In addition, the 2010 Trust programs (disaster relief, hardship assistance and immediate assistance) distributed more than $560,000 to Ecolab’s global 
associates  . Dis aster relief funds were 
provided to more than 32 associates in Chile following the February earthquake, and again to associates in Christchurch, New Zealand, following a serious earthquake  
in September  . 
The hardship program provided nearly $480,000 in grant and loan assistance to global associates in several countries, including Argentina, Peru, Mexico, Hong Kong, South Korea and Puerto Rico 
throughout the year  . And finally , the 
immediate assistance program provided 
assistance to more than 30 associates  .Refocusing  
Our Purpose  and Values
Our associates gain inspiration 
when they can see a clear connection between their work and 
a greater purpose  . During 2 010, as 
we outlined our five-year vision, we also recast our purpose and 
values statement  . Our go al was to 
help associates clearly see that the work they do matters — that they make a difference in helping make the world cleaner, safer and healthier, protecting the Earth’s resources and reducing the risks 
faced by our customers  . 
Since the launch of an internal campaign to introduce the updated purpose and values statement, many associates report a better understanding of the importance of their work — and they appreciate a common language to help 
them talk about what they do  . 
Although created for associates, the purpose and values statement is being used in presentations to prospective customers and 
employees  . C ustomers are finding 
alignment between their own and 
Ecolab’s values  . And po tential 
employees are able to more quickly understand the company and the 
purpose we serve  .

priorities at Ecolab  . W e’ve worked hard to 
develop a uniform, company-wide safety program focused on industry best practices that empowers every person to do his or her best work in the safest, most efficient 
manner possible  . In 2 010, Ecolab outlined 
these best practices in our new Associate and Driver Safety Handbook entitled: Safety: It’s up to Me! The book provides helpful insights and tips to keep safety awareness top-of-mind for associates 
whether at work, home or play  .
In addition, Ecolab’s Executive Safety Council set an aggressive safety 
improvement goal for our U  .S . busine sses: 
Ecolab will achieve Best-in-Class accident and injury rates by the end of 2015 
throughout our organization  . Using 2010 
data as our benchmark year, Ecolab has pledged to cut the accident and injury rates of our associates by more than half in the next five years in the areas of driver and 
associate safety  .
Yearly targets for accident and injury rate improvements have been established using 
third-party benchmark metrics  . F or 2011, our 
goal is an 11 percent reduction in both driver 
and associate incidents  .The driver safety key performance metric will be “Total Moving Accidents per Million Miles” and is provided by the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, a group that represents accident data from more than  15 large employers with 42,000 passenger and light service vehicles driven more than  
1 .1 billion miles  .
The associate safety key performance metric will be the “OSHA Recordable Injury Rate per 200,000 Hours Worked” and is 
provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  . 
It is the industry standard metric that  OSHA applies to us and that many 
customers also use  .

Partnering with Our Customers
Sustainability is at the very heart of what we do  .  
Safe food supplies and clean environments are 
foundational to a sustainable society  . E colab 
associates work every day throughout the world  
to enable our customers to increase safety, optimize 
water and energy use, and reduce waste  .
 
26 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010Ecolab’s “Total Impact Approach”:  
The Foundation of Sustainable SolutionsCreating Cleaner,  
Safer Environments
Restaurant managers do not want 
workers or guests slipping and falling 
on wet floors  . Y et every year, nearly 
3 million employees and 1 million customers are injured in slip-and-fall accidents, according to the National 
Restaurant Association  .
In 2009, Ecolab introduced the Scrub N Go
® (SNG) Floor Scrubber Vac System, 
to help quick service restaurants (QSR) 
clean and dry floors faster  . SNG w as 
certified as a “high traction” system by the National Floor Safety Institute because it maintained a coefficient of 
friction (CoF) of 0  .6 or gr eater  . T his 
meant it was 50 to 90 percent less likely that people would slip and fall on 
just-cleaned floors  . 
In 2010, a global customer put the SNG machine to the test at 12 of its 
QSR facilities across the U  .S . Ov er a 
4 .5-mon th period, the test locations 
saw a 93  .2 per cent drop in the number  
of guest-related slip and fall claims  
per month  .
Due to the fast-drying system in the SNG, the floors are wet for a fraction of the amount of time compared to 
traditional mopping  . As a result, when 
used appropriately, the SNG system creates a safer environment for both 
workers and guests  . We consider the total impact our products 
and practices have on the environment  . 
This includes not only product formulations, but also how the use of the product will affect the use of other natural resources (water and energy), how packaging will impact the environment, and the safety of 
the end user  . 
And while we are committed to sustainability in our own operations, we realize that the greatest contribution we can make to the environment is through our customers and through cleaning, sanitizing and infection prevention solutions that embrace our  
“Total Impact Approach  .”

Reducing water use by up to 97 percent 
in a manufacturing process is a significant goal, and it’s happening every day in customer food and beverage plants that have adopted a new technology called DryExx
® GS, a dry conveyor lubricant  . T he 
concept is to eliminate the water needed to deliver lubricant for glass packaging as it races through conveyors in the beverage, 
brewing and food processing industries  . 
Individual customers using the technology have reduced water use by as much as 500,000 gallons annually per production 
line . And bec ause of dryer floors, worker 
safety is enhanced  .The DryExx® technology was recognized

New Technology Reduces  Water Use by Up to 97 Percent
A Sustainable  
Dairy Partnership
In 2009, a team of Ecolab experts 
from our Water, Energy & Waste group partnered with our cleaning and sanitation group to conduct a Total Plant Assessment at 13 facilities for a North American food and beverage processing customer, identifying 
more than $5  .7 million in pot ential 
operations savings  .
The team evaluated each plant from influent to effluent, looking for the “complex connections” that are only possible when both groups of experts are in the plant looking 
for opportunities together  . T he 
groups then prioritized more than 172 recommendations so those with the lowest investment and greatest 
return could be implemented first  . 
Implementation began in 2010  .
Working with the customer’s operations team, Ecolab has helped implement a total of 121 immediate process 
improvements across 101 facilities  . B y 
the end of 2010, the customer had achieved the following reductions:
y    122 million gallons of water used 
y    87,000 DTH of energy 
y     4,094 metric tons of C02 waste 
These operational changes also realized a total savings of more than  
$1 .9 million  . Pr ocess improvements are 
continuing in 2011, helping the food and beverage chain create a cleaner, 
healthier, safer environment  .

Sustainable Solutions in 
Healthcare
Ecolab’s growing presence in the 
healthcare industry carries with it significant responsibility to both help reduce the risk of infection and to provide 
a safer environment for patients and staff  . 
Ecolab innovations that help improve safety and environmental protection in healthcare include:
y   Instead of shipping 15-gallon drums of liquid solution for cleaning and processing of surgical instruments in acute care hospitals, Ecolab utilizes our patented solids technology as part of the 
OptiPro™ system  . It provides customers 
with a concentrated instrument reprocessing solution that is mixed with water in a proprietary dispensing system that provides continuous notification of 
the delivery system status  . For customers 
previously using liquid drums, packaging waste is decreased by as much as 94 percent, and fuel and money is saved by 
avoiding shipments of liquid  . This system 
also uses color- and shape-coded blocks 
of product to allow for safer handling  .y   A pilot program with four healthcare customers demonstrated our ability to deliver innovation while improving environmental cleaning, as well 
as patient, staff and visitor safety  . 
Ecolab’s EnCompass™ and PROTECTTM 
programs feature advanced dispensing technology, concentrated products, microfiber cleaning tools, and improved 
processes, reporting and monitoring  . 
The comprehensive programs reduced water consumption by up to 86 percent, and reduced chemical use by up to 74 
percent  . Cle aning efficiency, the speed 
by which a room from a discharged patient could be ready for a new patient, 
improved by up to 15 percent  . A Hospitality 
Partnership Unfolds
Fresh, clean laundry is key to an 
enjoyable hotel stay  . Y et washing 
all those sheets and towels uses 
considerable energy and water  .
A global hospitality chain, in 
partnership with Ecolab, piloted a new integrated laundry system using a combination of low-temperature laundry products, audible dryer alarms and real-time data collection to try to wring out water and energy consumption at four onsite laundry 
facilities across North America  .
After the year-long pilot, the four participating hotels on average:
y   Used 830,000 gallons less water,  a 34 percent reduction
y   Used 730,000 gallons less hot water; 47 percent reduction
y   Saved 5,000 therms/year of energy; a 47 percent reduction
In addition, employees and customers 
noticed  improved quality  . Linens ar e 
noticeably cleaner, softer and smell 
fresher for longer periods of time  . In 
almost all instances, there was less staining and fewer towels and sheets 
had to be replaced  .
