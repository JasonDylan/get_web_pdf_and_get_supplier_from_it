In 2010, Gazprom Neft showed an increase in its key 
financial and production indicators and -re-affirmed its 
reputation of one of the top performers in oil and gas 
industry. Keeping up the drive to consolidate its verti -
cal integration, the Company has made significant 
progress in achieving its strategic objectives: new major 
production projects have been launched; petroleum re -
fineries are being effectively upgraded; the marketing 
network is growing fast; Company’s business units that 
engage in selling petroleum products through premium distribution channels show sustainable growth.
The Company lays the groundwork for its future 
growth, invests in the development of human resources 
capable of effectively addressing large-scale strategic 
goals, provides an adequate working environment, and implements staff support programmes.Gazprom Neft facilitates the establishment of a favour -
able social environment in the regions of its presence, 
and builds its relations with the local authorities as a 
strategic partnership. The Company puts special em -
phasis on social investments, which fuel the compre -
hensive development of the areas of Gazprom Neft’s presence and sustainable growth of the Company.
I am confident that Gazprom Neft’s achievements in 
2010 go a long way towards shaping the Company’s growth priorities in the context of its long-term strate -
gy. Achieving today’s goals paves the way for successful implementation of future projects and, ultimately , for sustainable growth of the Company’s value.Content Next chapter Previous chapter

2010 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT5In 2010, Gazprom Neft took a major step towards 
achieving its strategic objectives and showed sustain-
able growth rates across all business areas.
Summing up the 2010 results, I can confidently say 
that Gazprom Neft is approaching a whole new level 
of development, putting together the prerequisites for achieving long-term strategic objectives. As in the pre-vious years, the Company focused particularly on so-
cial and environmental projects, which are an integral 
part of Gazprom Neft’s operations.
In 2010, Gazprom Neft implemented a number of 
staff-support programmes designed to expand the opportunities for their professional growth and career 
development. Last year , we held our first-ever Corpo-
rate forum. A whole new dialogue involving informal 
meetings between the management and employees 
to discuss current issues of Gazprom Neft’s activities 
will become our routine practice.Gazprom Neft contributes greatly to the social and economic development of Russia’s regions where it 
does business as a major employer and taxpayer. In 
2010, we expanded our cooperation with the Russian regions based on social and economic agreements. 
These agreements stem from the Company’s commit-
ment to improve the quality of life of the local people, help local communities to address the problems they 
are facing, develop social infrastructure in the regions, 
promote sports and encourage the development of young people.
In 2010, the Company continued to introduce the cut-
ting-edge management systems in the areas of occu-
pational and environment safety and civil protection. 
Gazprom Neft makes every effort in order to bring its operations in compliance with the environmental 
regulations, fulfil its licence obligations and reduce the 
environmental impact.
All of Gazprom Neft’s initiatives are based on relations 
with a wide range of stakeholders who act as strategic partners in addressing economic, production, social 
and environmental issues. The fifth Annual Sustain-
able Growth Report describes the main trends and re-
sults of such cooperation.

its corporate social relations. Its stakeholders* include shareholders 
and investors, business partners, employees, public authorities, 
and local communities. The Company builds relationships with the 
stakeholders based on openness, mutual responsibility and respect. The quality of relations with the stakeholders largely determines the

of the stakeholders on an on-going basis and defines 
the agenda and forms of engagement. The Company polls its employees on a regular basis. Over 10,000

Corporate reporting on sustainable development is 
an important tool for promoting dialogue with the 
stakeholders. The Company believes that regular 
releases of sustainable development reports are an important part of corporate social responsibility. 
Disclosure of the Company's strategy, its management 
systems, and socially important outcome of its activities is a prerequisite for constructive stakeholder 
engagement. Gazprom Neft has been releasing such 
reports since 2007 and makes consistent efforts to improve their quality. A working group comprising 
representatives from the Company’s key divisions was 
set up to compile sustainable development reports.
The year 2010 saw continuation of the work to 
introduce the internationally accepted accounting principles into the Company's practice of sustainable 
development. When preparing this report, the 
Company used a set of principles and indicators from the Guidelines on Sustainable Development Reporting 
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), version G-3.

2010 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
The official Company website regularly posts information about upcoming competitive 
procurement. Other Internet resources and regional mass media are also used to post such information. Any prospective supplier or contractor registered with the Company website automatically receives e-mail alerts about the upcoming competitive auctions. There are about 3,000 subscribers to such electronic alerts.
JSC Gazprom Neft’s competitive contractor selection system does not establish any 
preferences for any particular supplier or contractor. Any contractor can become the business partner of the Company, if it can offer the best commercial terms and the items being purchased fully meet the Company-approved qualifications and technical requirements. The contractor selection process is conducted pursuant to corporate regulations. In 2010, Gazprom Neft was recognised as the industry leader in terms of the procurement procedure transparency according to a survey conducted by the Oil and Gas Information Agency.
Relations with existing and prospective partners expand beyond the competitive 
procedures. The employees of the Company are presented in the Coordinating Council for Oil and Gas industry Products, participate in joint conferences with suppliers, maintain the Register of oil and gas contractors, organise seminars and thereby form a civilised competitive market environment resulting in more effective procurement practices.
The new website uses white and blue corporate colours, modern graphic design and user-friendly navigation tools allowing Gazprom Neft customers to get quick and convenient up-to-the-minute information about the Company's sales offices and benefits of paying with the fuel card. The interactive filling station map can be used to locate any Gazprom Neft station in any region. In the future, the website will provide driving directions to each station based on proximity and petrol availability. The savings calculator helps make on-
line calculations of discounts and promotions. The my Account feature provides detailed

304 mn USD previous year. The Company allocates 
significant funds to expanding its assets in Serbia (NIS 
enterprise).Projects aimed at achieving the Gazprom Neft’s strategic goals 
are being implemented across all business areas. The Company is building a base for large-scale growth, investing in expansion 
of the resource base, increasing productivity of existing assets, 
improving the quality and depth of petroleum refining and expanding its sales and marketing effort. 
Gazprom Neft seeks to fulfill its obligations 
owed to the government in full and cooperate with the government agencies on industry-specific issues. in 2010, the 
Company’s employees together with the government agencies and other major Russian companies drafted documents that are extremely important for the purposes of sustainable expansion of the Company’s business and development of the Russian regions where the Company conducts its business, as well as for the power engineering market. in 
2010, JSC Gazprom Neft together with the government authorities and other petroleum companies was actively improving the industry’s taxation system in order to encourage the development of new production projects and enhancing the refining depth and quality of the petroleum products. A great deal of work was done in conjunction with the federal 
Antimonopoly Service in order to provide clear definition of the rules governing operation of the Russian petroleum product market.BUSiNESS S TRATEG y imPlEmENTAT iON
The ambitious plans for business expansion across all 
business areas call for large amounts of investment. 
The total amount of investment stood at 4.9 bn USD 
in 2010. A series of major projects were implemented in 2010 to acquire shares/stocks of the companies. 
The largest among them were the acquisition of an 
interest in the SeverEnergiya LLC authorised capital, consolidation of the Sibir Energy shares and buying 
45.3 % of interest in OJSC Gazprom Neft – Novosibirsk. 
The total amount of investment into acquisitions was 
1.6 bn USD.
JSC Gazprom Neft’s capital investment in maintaining 
and boosting the efficiency of its conventional assets 
amounted to 3.3 bn USD in 2010, which is 27 % up 
as compared with 2009. The capital investment in 
petroleum production grew by 17.6 % to 2.4 bn USD. 
The refining business received 414 mn USD , which is 35.3 % more than in 2009. Investment in petroleum 
products’ sales was up 69 % as compared with 47 ECONOmIC ACTIVITY: SUSTAINABILITY AND DEVELOPmENT

The increased hydrocarbon production in 2010 came 
as a result of systemic work conducted with an eye 
towards boosting the productivity of existing fields 
and expanding the Company’s resource base through acquisition of the new ones.
The prospecting and exploratory drilling and 
supplementary exploration conducted by the Group 
resulted in opening of the Severo-Vakynayskoye field 
and 17 new reservoirs at Vyngayakhskoye, Vyngapur , Ety-Pur , Novogodny, and Tympuchikanskoye fields. 
The expanded development drilling programme made 
it possible to commission 746 new operational wells in 2010
*, which is 79 wells more than in 2009.
High performance results shown by the existing assets were secured through streamlined field development; project support using geological/hydrodynamic 
simulation; introduction of comprehensive plans for 
field development; and introduction of new equipment and technology. The cost-cutting programme 
implementation, greater use of the associated gas and 
better infrastructure management have all significantly boosted the efficiency of operations. Well efficiency at 
Gazprom Neft is one of the highest in the industry
**.
The Company consistently expands its resource 
base through establishing new production centres, including in the promising petroleum-and-gas area on 
the Yamal peninsula, and through building a portfolio 
of the international assets. The Company develops competences needed for field development in the 
far North and beyond the Arctic Circle. In doing so, 
Gazprom Neft sets new goals for rational subsurface 
use in the established production areas with depleted 
resource base.
The Company carries out a programme to improve the 
associated gas utilisation ratio designed to mitigate 
the environmental risks and boost earnings for sales of additional amounts of the associated gas and its 
products.PETRO lEUm AND G AS Ex PlORAT iON AND PRODUCT iON

Structure of petroleum product production  
by Gazprom Neft Group, mn tThe commissioning of izomalk-2 at 
Omsk Refinery came as the top event of 
2010 in the refining business. izomalk-2 
is Russia’s and Europe’s largest light naphta isomerisation plant and also the third largest such plant in the world. The plant’s capacity is 800,000 tonnes per year. The plant makes high-octane motor fuel component  – 
isomerisate – used in the motor petroleum production. The isomerisate presence in motor fuel improves the motor performance and significantly cuts the hazardous substance content in exhaust gas, since this component does not contain sulphurous, olefinic or aromatic hydrocarbons.In 2010, the Company continued to share its leading 
market position in terms of increased volumetric gain 
of petroleum refining with other Russian petroleum 
companies. Gazprom Neft set a refinery crude run record in 2010 and the increase in volumes was noted 
at all refineries operated by the Company.
As the refineries are upgraded, the environmental 
characteristics improve, the conversion rate gets 
deeper , and the output and product range expand. In 2010, the production of motor petrol grew by 9.4 %, 
while the production of high-octane petrol was up 
12.7 %. The production of high-grade kerosene 
increased by 15.2 %, and diesel fuel production was 
up 15.4 %. Gazprom Neft joined the three top Russian 
bitumen producers and marketers, with a 33.8 % 
increase in production and sales. In late 2010, pilot 
sales of the new G-Drive high-octane fuel began in 
Russia’s Northeastern region.
The sales companies operated by Gazprom Neft 
engage in wholesale petroleum product sales and 
retail sales at the petrol filling stations. The sales of petroleum derivatives on the domestic market were 
up 17 % at 20.54 mn tonnes in 2010 as compared 
with 2009. In 2010, the number of functioning filling 
stations operated by the Company’s sales subsidiaries 
was up 50 to a total of 1,596. The average petroleum

On 1 November , 2010, Gazprom Neft lаunched the 
next phase of a large-scale advertisement campaign for Gazprom Neft’s retail brand of petroleum filling 
stations.
High service level at filling stations is among the priority 
issues pursued by Gazprom Neft’s retail network. The 
expansion of the filling stations network called for innovative solutions that would help the staff maintain 
the service quality consistent with the Gazprom 
Neft brand requirements. In 2010, the Company introduced mobile teams that regularly monitor the 
service quality and organise training for the filling 
stations’ staff. The Company’s sales companies run regular customer satisfaction surveys.49 ECONOmIC ACTIVITY: SUSTAINABILITY AND DEVELOPmENT

the annual petroleum production by 6 %-7 % annually. These 
ambitious growth plans can be sustained only through significant 
gains in petroleum exploration and production efficiency. The 
Company also has to deal with the depleted resource base, which 
raises the issue of enhanced oil recovery. Gazprom Neft is active in the regions with extremely low temperatures and complex geo-
logical conditions, which secures high demand for engineering

strategy is designed to achieve the level of the world 
leaders in 2020. Gazprom Neft has set up a solid 
foundation to achieve this goal and completed the 
formation of the Company’s IT department and in-troduced basic business support applications. This will 
serve as a basis to address higher-level issues, such as 
implementation of development projects and trans-formation of business processes based on information 
technologies.Gazprom Neft and BAS f conducted a joint 
seminar on promoting cooperation between 
the companies. The seminar addressed a wide range of issues concerning the implementation of innovative solutions by BAS f at Gazprom 
Neft refineries. in particular, the seminar par -
ticipants discussed the production of high-quality motor fuels, the use of additives, and issues involved in developing a Gazprom Neft fuel brand. The seminar was held as part of the joint action plan to develop mutually beneficial cooperation in the area of chemistry between Gazprom and BAS f.Gazprom Neft works together with the Russian scien-
tific and educational institutions, such as Gubkin Oil 
and Gas University and Tiumen State University, as 
well as innovative businesses, to solve problems that call for innovative approaches.
Gazprom Neft develops technological coopera -
tion with foreign partners, too. In 2010, a technol -
ogy centre was established at the moscow Refinery 
in collaboration with Yokogawa, one of the world’s 
leaders in industrial automation. The centre will be 
used to teach the automated process control system 
engineers at the moscow Refinery to operate new 
equipment and develop software for the Japanese 
company. Plans are in place to create refinery plant 
simulators for training purposes. This work is done under the project designed to improve operational 
efficiency, process monitoring and minimise the like -
lihood of accidents.
One of the key prerequisites for successful innovation 
includes a well-established professional communica-tions environment. Gazprom Neft focuses greatly on 
expanding the opportunities to share knowledge and 58 JSC GAzPROm NEfT

experience both within the Company and within the 
industry. In 2010, Gazprom Neft – NTTS R&D centre 
hosted the first International Research and Practice 
Conference called “Innovative Technologies.” The par-
ticipants included leading domestic and foreign re-
search centres and major oil and gas and oil field ser-
vices companies. The Plekhanov mining Institute in St. 
Petersburg, Gubkin Oil and Gas State University, Kazan 
(Volga) federal University, Krylov Oil Research Insti-
tute, TatNIPIneft R&D Institute, TomskNIPIneft R&D 
Institute, and UfaNIPIneft R&D Institute, as well as Schlumberger , Baker Hughes, and Weatherford-Poly-technic companies presented their designs. The four theme session discussions were attended by 168 pro-
fessionals who presented over 100 scientific reports.The Tiumen State University scientists have developed an innovative 
technology in environmental management, which will make the production almost waste-free. Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz was chosen as a platform for implementing the pilot project. The project was supported by the Russian government. The project will be used to create a mobile plant to process all types of waste, including the petroleum-contaminated soil, which, after special treatment, can be reused for field construction; petroleum separated during refining, which, after chemical treatment, can be sent to a petroleum treatment system; utility water that can be injected into the reservoir for pressure maintenance purposes. in addition, the design by the 
Tiumen scientists will help the Tiumen oil companies to minimise the adverse environmental impact, since the petroleum-containing waste will be treated using biotechnologies. The funding of the project stands at 180 million rubles, with 90 million coming from the government as a grant. The University will get another 90 million rubles from OJSC Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz.59 ECONOmIC ACTIVITY: SUSTAINABILITY AND DEVELOPmENT

Exploration and production
In 2010, JSC Gazprom Neft conducted geological 
and engineering operations at 1,236 wells, resulting 
in additional petroleum production in the amount of 
4,789,500 tonnes. Active use of the production stim-ulation and enhanced petroleum recovery techniques 
is among the most important outcomes of the Com-
pany’s technology development work. The total 2010 production due to introduction of the petroleum re-
covery techniques implemented during the reporting 
year (not including the carry-over effect) amounted to 1.355 mn t, or 4.5 % of the Company’s total pro-
duction. These techniques can significantly boost the amount of recoverable reserves and help develop low-grade reserves.
The Company applies physical, chemical, hydrody-
namic and thermal methods to stimulate productive 
formations. The bulk of additionally produced petro-
leum was obtained through the use of physical meth-ods, primarily hydrofracturing (476,470 tonnes). The 
hydrodynamic and chemical methods used in the field 
development under complex geological conditions produced additional 483,500 and 248,100 tonnes of 
petroleum, respectively.Re-activation of idle wells for potential petroleum 
production is one of the most important perfor -
mance indicators. The Company sees the solution in running a comprehensive analysis of the operat -
ing wells’ status and making the wells active using 
geological and engineering operations based on 
innovations. Gazprom Neft is developing an auto -
mated multi-criteria system to analyse idle wells. The 
software helps analyse inactive wells, assess available 
data of hydrodynamic and geophysical studies, and record the adjacent wells’ functioning parameters. 
The well assessment will help select the wells with 
the largest potential for conducting geological and engineering operations. In addition, the use of an au -
tomated analysis system will help plan maintenance and major repair works at a well selected for activa -
tion and monitor the effectiveness of all geological 
and engineering operations. The new system’s key 
advantage is that it will automate all processes in -
volved in analysis of the vast array of information 
needed for taking a decision on well “reanimation.” 
In 2010, the Company developed an online idle well database. The database Implementation at Gazprom 
Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz and the muravlenkovskneft 
branch will speed up the idle well analysis by 4.5 
times and save 14.9 mn RUB a year.
Geotechnical operations in 2007-2010
The use of the state-of-the-art geo -
logical and geophysical analysis by the 
R&D centre led to discovery of several large petroleum-saturated traps with the total reserves of over 30 mn t in the Jurassic deposits at Ety-Pur field, yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, in 
2009-2010. The implementation of the exploration programme in combina -
tion with drilling has helped to discover additional resources in the amount of 21.6 mn t at the vyngapur field.the intro Duction of innovative D esigns an D technological u PgraDing:

in 2010, the new hardware and software iskender complex designed by Gazprom Neft – 
NTTS R&D successfully passed the pilot production phase at the Ob and Sugmut fields. 
The complex is designed to analyse the efficiency of the three-component “reservoir-well-pump” system. iskender will reduce the incidence of early equipment failures 
through the use of the best pumping equipment at the wells with complex geological and production features. This software and hardware complex can also be used to draft feasibility studies or oil field development projects, analyse technological risks presented by new petroleum recovery technologies, and address a number of other scientific and applied issues. The full-scale implementation of iskender by the Company will reduce 
labour costs by five times and save 12.8 mn RUB a year.
Other promising developments include the E-field 
project, an integrated innovative solution designed to 
improve the exploration and development efficiency. 
The project’s key goal is about taking the best deci-sions and acquiring working hours of expertise for ex-
tensive introduction of digital technologies in drilling 
and production operations at the Company’s fields. The project provides for the development of a plan to 
equip the underground and surface field infrastructure 
with sensors and instrumentation for on-line moni-toring and remote controlling of the field operations. 
This project makes it possible to develop a system for 
production-related analysis and decision making with regard to the wells that are being put back into op-
eration, cyclic water flooding, repair and insulation 
works, hydrofracturing, etc. The introduction of this technology will help offset the decrease in daily pro-
duction by 10 % and cut energy consumption by up 
to 30 %.
The Energy Efficient Petroleum and Gas Production 
Techniques project is designed to reduce specific en-ergy consumption involved in petroleum production 
and transport and cut capital costs through cancelling 
the need to drill absorbing wells, reducing the booster pump stations’ capacity and narrowing the pipe diam-
eter. The project provides for separation of the produc-
tion water and pumping it back into the absorbent reservoir without bringing the water to the surface. If 
implemented, this technique may save up to 2.5 mn 
RUB in energy costs per one operating well.in 2010, pilot testing of the chemical method 
for treating the petroleum-containing waste 
in Western Siberia was conducted by the muravlenkovskneft branch. This is a waste-free 
technology, since the product resulting from treatment is a secondary material not soluble in water and is environmentally neutral.

tion programme scheduled to last until 2020. The 
programme provides for retrofitting of existing and 
construction of new refining facilities, increasing the process safety, and implementation of the envi -
ronmental projects at the enterprise. In general, the modernisation programme will see an investment of over 56 bn RUB.
Gazprom Neft’s marketing strategy calls for im -
proved performance through the use of modern 
information technologies. In 2010, the Company 
began commercial implementation of an integrated industrial automation system at its marketing enter -
prises. Gazprom Neft’s Department of Information Refining and marketing
The main goals of the Company’s innovative and R&D effort in the area of petroleum refining include 
establishing technological competitiveness, achieving 
new levels of product quality and dependability, cut-ting production costs, developing and producing new 
technologies, products and services. The core R&D 
objectives for 2010 included development and imple-mentation of production technologies, compliance 
with product quality standards, rational consumption 
of material resources, streamlining refinery operating modes, and enhancement of the occupational safety 
and environmental protection.
The Company pays a great deal of attention to mod-
ernisation of its refining sector and construction of the 
new facilities in order to comply with the requirements set forth by technical regulations “On requirements for 
automotive and aviation gasoline, diesel and marine 
fuel, jet fuel and heating oil,” which became effective in January 2009. The Company developed programmes 
to improve the motor fuel quality at OJSC Gazprom 
Neft-Omsk Refinery and OJSC moscow Refinery.
The large-scale modernisation programme currently 
underway at the Omsk Refinery is designed to improve the environmental performance of fuels manufactured 
by the plant, significantly increase the depth of pro-
cessing, and expand the volume and range of products that include high-octane petrol, diesel fuel, aromatic 
hydrocarbons, coke, modern bituminous materials, 
and petrochemicals. The total investment in the Omsk Refinery modernisation effort is planned above 100 
bn RUB in 10 years. The Izomalk-2 light gasoline frac-
tions isomerisation plant, which was commissioned in 2010, produces high-octane commercial petrol com-
ponent with zero-sulphur , aromatic and unsaturated 
hydrocarbon content. The project uses the technology that will lead to production of high-octane petrol com-
pliant with Class 4 and 5 requirements. The Izomalk-2 
implementation at the refinery will increase the refin-ing depth and boost the output of high-octane auto-
motive petrol.
The construction of the light naphtha isomerisation 
plant at the moscow Refinery began in 2010. The 
plant is designed to produce a motor petrol com -
ponent with an octane rating of up to 90.5 points, and is scheduled for commissioning in 2012 with a 
capacity of 650,000 tonnes per year. This facility is The Omsk Refinery conducted major 
repairs at the G-43-6 catalyst produc -
tion facility, including retrofitting of existing equipment and installing the new one. According to the refinery’s TOP (total optimisation of production) programme, they have assembled a louvered catalyst trap that captures up to 8% to 10% of the catalyst from exhaust coolant. They have introduced the Ultrasonic Bulava-2 unit designed for pulverisation of the catalyst sus -
pension. This unique design by the Russian scientists hasn’t yet been used by any Russian company. The G-43-6 overhaul will help stabilise quality and reduce the cost of catalysts used in catalytic cracking plants.62 JSC GAzPROm NEfT

In 2010, the Company continued to introduce the 
grade system at the enterprises engaged in production, 
petroleum products supplies, product manufacturing 
and a number of other SACs. The grade system was implemented at 32 enterprises by late 2010.
The performance of the new motivation systems’ 
introduction depends on the enterprise personnel’s 
readiness for changes. In order to accelerate and 
facilitate the adaptation to new rules and methods, the executives and HR managers study the rules of new 
systems at the Corporate centre, actively participate 
in the communication sessions and corporate forums in order to inform the employees in detail about the 
principles of the changes, help line managers build 
staff relations based on new requirements.The criteria for grade assignment in -
clude required level of professional ex -
pertise, experience, business-specific 
knowledge, level of job complexity, and level of the decision-making authority. The Company’s employees participated in the development and implementation of this programme, including round table discussions, communication ses -
sions at the SACs, and traveling semi -
nars with the participation of the per -
sonnel management consultants. The employees were members of the proj -
ect’s working groups. During the grad -
ing training, the SAC workers evaluated job positions and developed the wage scales.71 HUmAN RESOURCE DEVELOPmENT

NON-fiNANC iAl mOT ivATiONIn addition to respectable wages, Gazprom Neft provides 
inclusive social support to its employees. In 2010, the 
Company developed a corporate approach to provision 
of social benefits designed to improve the employees’ social protection and staff loyalty. The Gazprom Neft’s 
employees were regularly updated about this project; 
the SAC employees took part in the project sessions. They have put together a single standard “corporate 
benefit portfolio” to be made available to all Gazprom 
Neft employees and an extra set of benefits to be selected by each enterprise depending on the needs, 
productivity levels and effectiveness of the enterprise. 
The standard portfolio includes health insurance, bodily injury insurance, maternity allowances to young 
mothers, bereavement allowance, etc. The amount of 
social benefits rose by 21.5  % in 2010 as compared 
with 2009. On average, each employee receives 29,000 
rubles in such benefits.
As is known, non-financial motivation plays a 
significant role in enhancing staff loyalty, increasing productivity, and reducing staff turnover. Improving the 
non-financial motivation system is an important part 
of relations with the staff. The Company developed the non-financial motivation concept in 2010. 
The participation of managers in the non-financial 
motivation process and greater involvement of staff into these initiatives are among the key goals of the 
Gazprom Neft’s human resources development effort.
The year 2010 saw the expansion of the award-
issuing campaign and a great number of the 
professional contests and sports competitions. The Company expanded its sports and recreational 
activities programme and the practice of corporate 
communication sessions at the level of blocks and services.The Company employees have access to doctor’s advice and treatment at the best Russian hospitals as part of the 
corporate agreement for voluntary health insurance.
A corporate mortgage programme is available in certain 
Russian regions to help the employees buy new housing. 
The programme provides for partial compensation by the enterprise of the interest payments. This programme 
will be amended in 2011 to make a larger number of 
employees eligible for using it.
in 2010, 1,100 best workers received 
the awards: 157 employees received 
Gazprom Neft awards, 135 received Gazprom awards, and 808 people were recognised by corporate awards. 72 JSC GAzPROm NEfT

in June 2010, Omsk was the venue for the 3rd annual sports event entitled 
“Health and vigour” also known as the fakel Club veterans’ Spartakiad. The 
Club is a one-of-a-kind community of former Omsk Refinery employees 
with over 4,000 members. Three hundred seventy veterans took part in the competitions, which is an all-time high for this event.

Club members. Gazprom Neft Omsk is Gazprom Neft’s marketing arm operating in the Omsk Region. The competition prize winners received honorary mentions, cups and valuable prizes.SPORTS AND R ECREAT iON
Support of the employees’ high energy levels and 
health is one of the most important components of the 
Company’s social responsibility and also a significant 
factor behind increased productivity and high economic and industrial performance indicators.
Corporate Spartakiads, tournaments and competitions 
tend to foster the team spirit. In 2010, the Company 
traditionally held its winter and summer Spartakiads and 
the football tournament among the refineries’ teams for Gazprom Neft prizes. The Company employees have for 
the first time taken part in the Gazprom’s Spartakiads.
The Company focuses greatly on the corporate sports 
development. The Company’s Sports and Recreation Council is chaired by Alexander Dyukov, chairman of the Gazprom Neft’s management board. The Council members include Company’s executives, Olympic champions and world champions in various sports.73 HUmAN RESOURCE DEVELOPmENT

COOPERAT iON W iTH T RADE U NiONS
The Company is actively cooperating with the unions 
in developing and implementing its social programs. 
Over two-thirds of the Company’s employees* are 
union members and are actively involved in issues af-fecting professional, social and labour rights and inter-
ests of the workers. mutual obligations of the employ-
ees and the Company regarding their interaction in 
the socio-economic issues and labour protection and 
industrial safety issues are set forth in collective agree-ments applicable to all employees of a specific com-
pany that signed such collective agreement. Beginning 
in 2011, new collective agreements will be drafted according to the recommended standard form. Their 
content will depend on the performance of the enter-
prise in question. Trade unions are involved in solving labour disputes 
and conducting negotiations with the corporate ex-
ecutives. In 2009, the Corporate Coordinating Council was established to provide a link with the unions and 
JSC Gazprom Neft workforce. The Council is respon-
sible for putting together the proposals on person-nel and social policies, coordination of work with the 
unions and employee representatives as part of the 
social partnership, and social protection of the em-ployees. At its 2010 meetings, the Council considered 
the most important issues raised by the labour collec-
tives from all Company’s major business areas. At the initiative of the Council, the Company’s Board meeting 
discussed the issue of providing the workers with the 
second set of personal protective equipment and spe-cial clothing, creation of a private pension fund, and 
introduction of a mortgage programme. The Board is-
sued relevant instructions regarding further study and implementation of the Council’s recommendations.
The standard collective agreement form contains a labour Protection 
section, which defined the responsibilities of employers and trade unions to 
put in place and oversee the labour protection measures and monitor their results. The section defined the responsibilities of the labour protection commissioners, members of the commissions (committees) for occupational safety and elected officials of the grassroots trade union organisations in creating safe working conditions, prevention of occupational injuries and diseases. The section entitled “Employment Promotion” regulates the balance of interests of employers and employees during reorganisation of the Company or staff cuts; it sets forth the minimum notice period
* to be issued 
prior to conduct of the appropriate actions by the employment services and the appropriate elected body of the grassroots union organisation. 
* This figure includes the Russia-based personnel.
** Not later than two months before the appropriate actions take place. If the decision on job or staff cuts may result in mass layoffs, then at least three months prior to such 
actions. 74 JSC GAzPROm NEfT

them an average of 9 points out of 10). About 300 
employees received training under these programs in 2010. The programme participants included heads 
of the departments / offices at the Corporate Centre, 
general directors and deputy general directors at SACs, heads of departments / divisions at the SACs, heads 
of the human resources services and employees with 
confirmed potential for further development.

Creating managerial personnel reserve is among the 
strategic staff-related initiatives. High-quality reserve 
minimises personnel risks and also serves as additional 
motivation. The effort to introduce a multi-tiered in -
ternal personnel reserve programme at Gazprom Neft 
has been on since 2007 and received another boost 
In 2010. The system for testing the management and communication competencies’ succession candidates 
was effectively put into place. The personnel reserve 
system targeting specific positions is being implement -

In 2010, staffing of the Company's major projects in Russia and abroad came to the forefront. Gazprom 
Neft’s portfolio comprises six priority projects in the 
petroleum industry, each being unique and in need of special attention. In 2010, the Directorate for major 
projects was established. Large projects call for sub-
stantial investment, top-quality decisions, availability of skilled personnel with experience in implementing 
major projects in challenging environments and inter-
national work experience. Therefore, the personnel service is facing such problems as recruiting qualify-
ing employees, their training, and establishment of a 
personnel reserve to fill the needs of the expanding project teams.
Senior managers play the key role in 
building world-class teams. The Com -
pany’s top managers participate in 
the international conferences, semi -
nars and training programs offered by leading business schools. Special session for Gazprom Neft’s top man -
agers was organised in The Hague (Netherlands) by moscow School of

participation in the Company’s development strategy. The forum was attended by 400 delegates representing 
all Company’s structural units and SACs. A better word for this Corporate forum would be a programme 
rather than an event: A programme of internal corporate dialogue on key Company development issues, including the selection of enterprise representatives and making a list of questions that are important to people working at various enterprises in different Russian regions. All Company employees were given an opportunity to participate in the forum in absentia and use the internet portal to ask questions and get 
answers from the management. The Chairman of the management Board Alexander Dyukov, Gazprom’s 
first Deputy General Director vadim yakovlev, and Deputy General Director for Organisational issues vitaly

federation, legal acts of the constituent entities of the Russian 
federation, and on Russia’s Energy Strategy and strategies for 
socio-economic development of the constituent entities of the Russian federation. The concept of the Company’s regional 
policy was developed based on the relations with regional 
administrations and local communities. In early 2010, the Company made a special study 
to analyse its relations with the Russian regions 
and its regional development goals that include the Company’s main areas and regions of operations. Both 
the Company specialists and independent experts 
participated in this study. The results of the study helped to identify the key areas of regional policies

Gazprom Neft understands leadership strategy as something that goes beyond 
the operational and financial performance indicators. Expanding the Company’s operations and attaining new horizons in production calls for improved environmental management and labour protection. Gazprom Neft has set a goal to join the ranks of the leading international petroleum companies in terms of the industrial and environmental safety and labour protection. SAFE DEVELOPMENT: 
INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY, LABOUR PROTECTION6Content Next chapter Previous chapter
STRATEG y AND GO vERNANCE
Gazprom Neft believes that reducing the risk of negative 
environmental impact and safety enhancements are its 
strategically important goals. The Company is guided by the 
precautionary principle* in its life, health and environmental risk 
management. The Company has been working consistently to 
improve the industrial and environmental safety levels, ensure 
compliance with the environmental regulations, and reduce negative environmental impact of industrial activities in a 
purposeful and effective manner.
These issues are closely interrelated and should be 
addressed in their entirety. Their effective solution calls for improving quality of the governance in the 
area of industrial and environmental safety, labour 
and civil protection, coordination of activities at all the Company’s and subsidiaries’ and affiliates’ units and 
divisions. Guiding itself with the best international 
practices, the Company develops and implements the integrated management system in the field of industrial 
and environmental safety, labour and civil protection, 
works on building a unified regulatory and procedural framework in this sphere and its subsequent effective 
implementation in the Company’s subsidiaries and 
affiliates.
The integrated control system for occupational safety 
and labour and environmental protection secures the implementation of a single policy in the area of 
industrial and environmental safety, labour and civil 
protection.
The Company's activities in the field of industrial and 
environmental safety, labour and civil protection are coordinated by the Corporate Centre. The Occupational 
Safety Department includes offices specialising in 
occupational safety, labour and health protection, issues of environmental safety, as well as programmes 
and activities covering fire safety, civil protection and 
emergency management. The Company’s industrial 
and environmental safety, labour and civil protection 
management structure includes appropriate services at the production units, subsidiaries, and affiliates.

A well-conducted investigation reveals the key causes of accidents and helps develop the measures 
designed to eliminate them. Timely implementation of measures upon the investigation results reduces the number of repeat occurrences. High quality communication support is an important factor in securing an investigation’s effectiveness. The management scrutinises the investigation outcomes and relays them to the employees. The Company has developed special accident fact sheets and distributes them among the employees. The fact sheets include information and vivid visual imagery that deliver the lesson. The results of the work performed in 2010 can be seen in reduced numbers of injuries and traffic accidents. The implementation of the programme for policy 
implementation and integrated management 
system in the field of occupational safety, labour 
and environment protection was initiated in 2008 (figure 2). In accordance with this programme, the 
Company did as follows in 2010: • Improved the quality of accident investigation;
• Organised production control over compliance 
in the field of occupational safety requirements 
and conducted audit of the occupational safety, labour and environmental protection management

The Company believes it’s important to maintain the dialogue with the stakeholders on the 
occupational and environmental safety issues, exchange views with the expert community and the public at large. in late 2010, Gazprom Neft held the first international Environmental Conference 
«The Company’s Dynamic Development in the Area of Environmental Safety during Reform of the Environmental legislation.» The conference brought together executives and specialists from the 
Corporate Centre, subsidiaries of the companies engaged in petroleum production and refining, petroleum product supplies, and petroleum field services representing Western Siberia, the Urals, European Russia, C iS and the Republic of Serbia, as well as the experts from the ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environmental Protection, federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources, 
Russian Commerce and industry Chamber’s Committee on Sustainable Development and Environmental Protection, and independent experts representing major scientific organisations in the field of environmental protection. The conference addressed issues related to the Company's activities during the reform of the environmental legislation, areas and mechanisms for ensuring cleaner production, and reduction of anthropogenic pressures on the environment.
business process ultimately designed to cut costs and 
increase business performance. The regulation passed 
a series of expert examinations and was approved by 
the industry’s supervisory bodies. There are plans to develop the software in 2011 to support the processes 
set forth by the regulation and organise its pilot run at 
a petroleum-producing enterprise and a refinery.
Regularly conducted audits are an integral part of 
the occupational safety, labour and civil protection management system implementation. The audits 
help estimate the system’s current status and new 
developments and develop sound recommendations for improving the system. In 2010, the Company 
first conducted an audit of the occupational safety, 
labour and civil protection management systems at its key enterprises engaged in petroleum 
production, petroleum field services, refining and 
petroleum product supplies. The audit was carried out by the audit teams comprised of the properly 
certified subsidiary and affiliate employees from the 
Company’s various areas of business. Based on the audit recommendations, subsidiaries and affiliates 
developed the measures to improve the management 
systems. The audit has also provided a platform for sharing experiences among the subsidiaries. This 
work will be continued in 2011.
Sustainable functioning of the environmental 
protection management system requires appropriate staffing. Gazprom Neft is very serious about the 
professional training of employees working in this 
area. The Company regularly conducts workshops 
for managers and professionals responsible for environmental safety and waste management. In 
2010, 749 managers and specialists were trained 
in the field of environmental safety. In 2010, about 50,000 Company employees took classes in a number 
of occupational safety, labour and civil protection 
regulations.
The occupational safety, labour and civil protection 
management system also applies to the third-party contractors. By doing so, Gazprom Neft promotes 
environmental responsibility and adherence to high 
occupational safety standards by the Company’s suppliers. In 2010, Gazprom Neft adopted a regulation 
entitled «Procedure for managing contractors and 
the organisation of relations in occupational and environmental safety, labour and civil protection.»SAfE DEVELOPmENT: INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONmENTAL SAfETY , LABOUR PROTECTION 101

The Company strives to ensure continued improvement of 
safety and a steady decline in the number of injuries, job-related 
accidents and occupational diseases.
In addition to its corporate integrated risk management 
system, the Company adheres to a corporate regulation entitled «The procedure for identifying, 
assessing and minimising risks related to occupational 
and environmental safety, labour and civil protection,» that makes it possible to expand the risk-minimising 
activities to cover «the human factor», which is not 
always easily quantifiable. The process set forth in this paper is based on a qualitative risk assessment. The 
Company employees have drawn up risk assessment 
maps for all types of work and operations. The results of this evaluation were used to develop specific 
measures designed to reduce or eliminate risks. The 
map is used by the managers to brief the designated workers, prepare written permits for work involving 
heightened risk, and draft the instructions. The process 
underlying the risk analysis process and compilation of risk analysis maps has become very instrumental in 
enhancing the safety culture: the Company employees 
who were involved in it could clearly see their role and responsibilities in improving the occupational safety.The responsibility for the workers’ labour and health 
protection is shared by the Company’s management 
and trade unions. The collective agreements reflect their mutual commitments in this area.
Reducing occupational accident rate
The occupational accident rate was down due to implementation of the safety standards and 
occupational safety, labour and environmental 
protection programmes in 2010.
The Company has established a corporate regulation 
that defines the procedure for providing workers with personal protective equipment. Overalls bought by 
the Company meet domestic and European safety 
requirements. In 2010, the Company spent 13,000 RUB per person to purchase personal protective 
equipment.
Traffic safety
Since 2009, the Company has been implementing a 
set of measures to ensure traffic safety, including the 
development of regulatory documents, conduct of 
the safety months and organisation of staff training. This approach yielded results. In 2010, the number of 
traffic accidents fell by 24 %. Relative accident rates 
also show the improvements in traffic safety.

Developing a culture of safety is a prerequisite for 
achieving the Company's goals in the area of labour and environmental protection. Senior executives should play a key role here: their decisions and behaviors affect the level of compliance with the safety requirements at the production facilities run by them. in 2010, Gazprom Neft organised 
seminars under the programme « leadership in 
the field of occupational and environmental safety, labour and civil protection for senior executives.» The seminars were attended by over 200 senior and middle management from the Corporate Centre and Gazprom Neft’s subsidiaries and affiliates. The participants of the study reviewed key components of effective behavior of an executive as a leader in the field of occupational safety, labour and civil protection, and drafted plans to improve the safety culture in their units
Readiness for emergency situations
Gazprom Neft’s policies and regulations in the area 
of occupational and environmental safety, labour and 
civil protection seek to minimise risks and prevent 
accidents. maintaining a high level of preparedness for 
emergency situations remains a priority. To this end, the Company has conducted activities to prevent the 
disasters and to conduct cleanup operations based on 
the action plans. The subsidiaries and affiliates have 
developed, approved and put such plans into action. 
In order to ensure their readiness for emergency management, subsidiaries and affiliates have 
established reserve funds and material resources. The

ENviRON mENT AND E ffiCiENT USE O f RESOURCES
The petroleum companies have a sizeable impact on the natural 
environment, including air emissions, discharges into water 
bodies, buildup and disposal of industrial waste. Being a socially 
responsible organisation, JSC Gazprom Neft understands its responsibility for the environmental conservation. The Company 
is committed to achieve full compliance of its operations with 
applicable environmental laws, fulfill its license obligations, and minimise environmental damage in all areas of its business: 
petroleum production, refining, and marketing. 
Gazprom Neft actively develops and implements 
innovative technologies that help achieve production, economic and environmental efficiency, produce 
products with enhanced environmental specifications. 
The Company closely monitors the quality of soil, atmospheric air , water bodies in order to quickly 
identify and address arising problems.
Gazprom Neft allocates significant funds for the 
implementation of environmental programmes 
and activities. In 2010, the operating expenses on environmental protection remained at the 2009 level. 
The funds were used to protect water reserves from 
contamination, upgrade sewage treatment plants, conserve (reclaim) the process dump at the Omsk 
Refinery and to take other environmental measures. 
The operating expenses also include costs involved in the development of regulatory documentation, environmental monitoring, industrial environmental 
control, staff development and training in the field of 
the environmental protection. The capital expenditures were up significantly. They included construction and 
renovation of the industrial and household solid waste 
landfills at the fields, replacement of the storage tank accessories’ pontoon equipment at the refineries, 
shutdown of water wells operated by the petroleum 
field services companies, construction and renovation of treatment facilities at the marketing enterprises and 
major repairs of fixed assets (flares, furnace, pumping 
equipment, pipelines, etc.).
As much as 16.2 mn RUB were allocated for 
reclamation, including the oil viscous fluid spill on the Vyngapur field due to a burst pipeline. 
Atmospheric emissions
The addition of new assets to the Company and the expansion of its existing businesses increase the 
number of environmental protection challenges faced 
by the Company. The tasks of reducing emissions by mining enterprises, which account for most of these 
emissions, are particularly relevant. 
The increase in gross emissions by the Company’s 
enterprises in comparison with 2009 is due to the 
acquisition of new assets: OAO NGK Slavneft, JSC Tomskneft-VNK, CJSC Gazprom Neft Orenburg, OJSC 
moscow Refinery, and OJSC NK-magma, as well as to 
the ever-increasing number of filling stations.
The greenhouse gas emissions are reduced primarily 
through implementation of the programme for recovery of associated petroleum gas (APG), which 
involves the construction of gas gathering systems 
and gas processing plants, including energy facilities. The greenhouse gas emissions reduction has become 
a source of revenue for the Company during the 
implementation of a joint project with the Japanese mitsubishi Corporation at the Ety-Pur field operated 
by muravlenkovskneft under the Kyoto Protocol 
arrangements.

 * VOC stands for volatile organic compounds.
** Gas flaring and release into the atmosphere in accordance with the IPIECA/API recommendations include, in addition to the associated gas, releases into the atmosphere  
   (fanning) in the area of petroleum product supplies or flaring in the refining area. In the area of petroleum refining business, the 
emissions are being steadily brought down through 
a combination of environmental measures, such as 
renovation of the production facilities, replacement of burners at the furnaces, outfitting tanks with modern 
emissions-reducing devices, and the commissioning 
of a plant to secure leak-tight loading of the petroleum products. The implementation of a major project 
under the mid-term investment programme by Rmz 
Gazprom Neft – Omsk Refinery LLC – the construction of a new fuel hydrotreatment facility – will alleviate 
the environmental impact of the Company's products, 
since the production of high-quality fuel will greatly reduce the atmospheric emissions.
The Company conducts comprehensive analysis of the 
environmental and economic efficiency of the light 
petroleum product vapor recovery systems installed 
at the petrol stations operated by subsidiaries. All-inclusive assessment of existing and prospective 
recovery systems helps the Company to plan the 
integration of these systems with the projects for 
petrol stations’ construction and reconstruction in 
order to ensure almost complete (up to 95 %-98 %) 
prevention of the fuel vapor emissions at the petrol 
stations.Associated petroleum gas recovery 
(APG) 
The increased use of associated gas is among the 
industry’s priorities, a task of national importance. 
In 2010, the Company’s APG resources amounted 
to approximately 4.2 bn m3, and the associated gas recovery levels stood at 54.6 % instead of the planned 
49.3 %. Such high actual levels are due mostly to 
streamlined load of the gas processing capacity at CJSC SIBUR Holdingand connecting the Ety-Pur field 
with the APG transport and processing system. 
To further enhance the effective associated gas 
recovery levels, the Company developed a medium-
term investment program for 2011-2013 including three regional projects comprising the APG utilisation 
projects’ basic portfolio:
• South Ob Project;
• Noyabrsk Integrated Project;
• Tomsk Integrated Project.

Energy consumption and energy 
efficiency
Gazprom Neft never stops to improve the production 
efficiency and rational use of energy resources. The 
Company’s enterprises regularly monitor energy 
consumption and implement programmes to reduce energy consumption. 
The main areas of improving the energy efficiency at 
the Gazprom Neft enterprises include implementation 
of the program to reduce the electricity consumption 
and cut costs involved in procurement of electricity by way of streamlining the energy supply arrangements.
The implementation of the Energy Saving Programme 
in petroleum production in 2006 - 2010 resulted 
in savings of 3,538 mn RUB, including 1,401 mn 
RUB in 2010. A programme for energy efficient petroleum production designed to reduce energy 
consumption in the petroleum production processes 
is being implemented. It cut the specific energy 
consumption by 3.3 % in 2010 as compared with 
2009, down from 32.8 kWh to 31.7 kWh / thou. 
residents, respectively). The total power consumption 
by the petroleum production enterprises amounted to 
5.377 bn kWh in 2010, which is 107 million kWh, or2 %, less than in 2009. meanwhile, the level of 
liquid production rose by 1.6 %. The introduction of 
a monitoring system and implementation of measures to increase the power supply reliability has led to a decrease in petroleum losses from 96,000 tonnes to 22,000 tonnes per year and, accordingly, an increase 
in revenue by 365 mn RUB during four years.
Gazprom Neft is actively developing its own power 
generation capacity. As of the end of 2010, 11  % of 
the Company’s electricity needs are met using its own 
power generation facilities. The project is designed 
to reduce the cost of electricity and, thereby , cut the 
production costs. Currently , Gazprom Neft operates six power plants. The largest one is located on the 
South Priobsky field, which is Gazprom Neft’s key 
production asset accounting for over 20  % of the 
Company’s production. The Company’s own total 
power generation capacity amounted to 140 mW at 
the end of 2010. In December 2010, the second phase of the South Priobsky gas turbine power plant with the 
capacity of 96 mW was commissioned on Priobskoye 
field operated by Gazprom Neft-Khantos LLC.
Since 2009, the power consumption by petroleum 
refineries grew by 7.5 % from 2.774 bn kWh to 2.982 
bn kWh due to increased volume of refined petroleum and the commissioning of new refining capacities.
The Company’s refineries are implementing energy 
efficiency programmes. Their implementation should bring down power consumption at Rmz Gazprom 
Neft – Omsk Refinery LLC by 4.8 % by 2013, which 
will boost the revenue by 146 mn RUB. OJSC moscow

and uninterrupted power supply after replacement 
of the worn-out equipment and implementation of 
appropriate measures. The economic benefit amounts 
to 47 mn RUB.
In 2010, the power consumption by enterprises 
engaged in petroleum product supplies amounted to 0.089 bn kWh. The power consumption is planned to 
increase by 14.6 % in 2011 due to increased number 
of facilities and expansion of services, and reach 
0.102 bn kWh. The implementation of measures to reduce power consumption at the filling stations should provide an economic benefit of up to 50 mn 
RUB in 2011. An energy audit at the filling stations is 
scheduled for 2011 followed by the development of a list of standardised measures to be implemented at the 
enterprises engaged in petroleum product supplies in 
order to streamline the power consumption.
Heat consumption rose from 334,000 Gcal in 2009 
to 359,000 Gcal in 2010 due to commissioning of the boilers on the Priobsky, Kholmisty and Chatylkinskoye 
fields. The thermal power costs stood at 535 mn RUB 
in 2010.
The use of water resources
The Company's enterprises seek to maximise the use of water resources. Water consumption to cover the 
Company’s own needs decreased by 16 % in 2010 as 
compared with 2009 reflecting increased efficiency 
at the production enterprises. The Company's 
enterprises carefully monitor the impact of the 
production on the water bodies. modernisation of the production facilities and renovation of the wastewater 
treatment plants secures consistent improvements in 
the industrial effluent quality.Total water consumption and waste water, 2008-2010Consumption of bought-in energy, 2008-2010

* Sites with accumulated industrial waste.Land use and reclamation
Reclamation of disturbed land is among the Company’s 
priorities designed to reduce the environmental 
impact of its industrial operations. Gazprom Neft is 
confronted with the need to address issues related to its current operations and legacy issues. Programmes 
for land reclamation and sludge pits
* include disturbed 
land inventory, assessment of soil contamination levels and choosing the most effective land reclamation 
techniques. The services of independent experts are enlisted for evaluation of the reclamation effort 
effectiveness. In 2010, the Company reclaimed 696 
hectares of contaminated land. The contaminated sludge pit and land reclamation data include the acquired assets. The area of disturbed land, including the petroleum-contaminated ones, 
increased in 2010 due to revision of the inventory 
numbers and acquisition of new assets.
Gazprom Neft restores fertility of lands contaminated 
by pipeline bursts and secures their recovery for intended use. Accident prevention is the Company’s 
key area of concern. The volume of spilled oil decreased 
in 2010 as compared with 2009 due to major repairs, corrosion-resistant coating and inhibition of piping 
conducted under the program for improving the 
pipeline reliability.

The Company does not operate in protected natural areas. However, the Company's 
development strategy makes provisions for a significant increase in exploration and production, including petroleum fields located on Russia’s Arctic shelf. in order to 
effectively reduce the adverse impacts of economic activities in offshore operations and include additional environmental standards into the field development projects, the Company evaluates the possible impact of the hydrocarbon exploration, production and transportation on marine ecosystems.in 2010, with the participation of the Russian specialists from the World Wildlife fund 
(WW f), the Company conducted an assessment of the status and impact of its operations 
on the populations of marine mammals in the Pechora Sea (Atlantic subspecies of walrus, beluga whale, ringed seal, and harp seal). The walrus proved to be the most vulnerable species. Currently, it is designated in the Russian list of endangered species as species with steadily decreasing population size, but may soon fall into the critically endangered category. The project was used to assess the ecosystem components that are critical for survival of the Pechora Sea rare marine mammals. The researchers have identified the key anthropogenic factors that may affect these species if planned hydrocarbon production and transportation in the Pechora Sea become a reality, and drafted proposals seeking to minimise the impact. in addition, they have prepared 
the analytical materials on species composition and status of marine mammals in the southeastern part of the Barents Sea and adjacent areas of the Kara and White seas. The proposals designed to minimise human impact on vulnerable marine mammals and their habitats will be included in the environmental action plans for the period of validity of the licenses covering the Company’s activities on the shelf. Waste management
Low hazard and almost non-hazardous waste (hazard 
class IV and V) account for 90 % of waste produced by 
the Company's operations with drill cuttings forming the bulk of the waste. 
Waste production in 2010 decreased due to the 
introduction of pitless development well drilling at Gazprom Neft-Khantos LLC and the transfer of drill 
cuttings ownership to drilling contractors. Reducing 
waste, which inevitably causes the environmental damage, is a major environmental goal and an important 
part of enhancing the performance. Gazprom Neft 
addresses this issue through minimising waste production and recycling. A unique drill cutting-treatment plant at 
Gazprom Neft-Khantos turns waste into a safe liquid 
that is subsequently pumped under pressure back into a reservoir at a depth of about 2,000 metres.Waste production by areas of operation, 2009-2010

Exploration and production
The existing petroleum-contaminated land 
reclamation techniques do not take into account the 
low temperatures or marshlands predominating in 
the Company’s areas of operations. The Company’s employees work on this problem trying to cut the 
sludge pit and land reclamation costs. The main 
areas of research conducted by the Company in this area include the development of new technological 
solutions and effective interventions to reclaim the 
contaminated lands taking into account the specific landscape and biochemical conditions, as well as 
the economic costs involved in the development of innovative technological solutions designed to neutralise drilling cuttings for subsequent sludge pit 
reclamation.
A programme for processing petroleum-containing 
waste was developed and implemented in order to reduce the adverse environmental impact of waste disposal. In 2010, over 8,000 tonnes of petroleum-
containing waste were neutralised at the production 
enterprises using the thermal method. 
The Company pays great attention to compliance 
with the environmental regulations and reducing the 
adverse environmental impact during construction. 
The Company uses environmentally friendly pitless drilling methods during the construction of multiple 
well platforms located in the riparian buffer zones. A 
specially designed toxicological monitoring procedure is used to ensure compliance with the environmental 
regulations. Reduced land allocation for the sludge 
pits, prevention of natural environment disturbances during their construction and operation, and filtration of contaminants in the subsurface water also helps to 
mitigate the environmental impact.
JSC Gazprom Neft builds special landfills to accommodate 
and recycle production waste. in 2010, the Company began 
the construction of three industrial and household solid waste landfills at the Shinginskoye, Urmanskoye and southwestern part of the Krapivinskoye petroleum and gas field operated by Gazprom Neft- vostok llC. The landfills are built based on 
the projects that passed the state ecological examination. in 
addition, the existing industrial and household solid waste landfill located in the southern part of the Priobskoye field and operated by Gazprom Neft-Khantos llC came under renovation.SAfE DEVELOPmENT: INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONmENTAL SAfETY , LABOUR PROTECTION 111

Oil refining 
The priority directions to ensure environmental safety 
at oil refineries are as follows: 
• Renewal and improvement of current processes 
using up-to-date catalytic agents.
• Construction of modern processing plants with 
non-waste and low-waste technologies and 
decommissioning of worn out and outdated production facilities.
• Introduction of new gas emission and waste water treatment technologies.
• Selection and introduction of generated and 
accumulated industrial waste disposal technologies.
All equipment replacement and modernisation projects, and introduction of new technologies include a serious 
environmental component. This calls for a new higher-efficiency equipment to be installed, which would 
comply with stricter environmental requirements and 
would improve the quality of petroleum products.Raw material tank farms at resource bases are being 
renovated at Omsk Refinery in accordance with the 
Company’s development concept. New tanks installed in 2010 are equipped with modern aluminium floating 
roofs to minimise the negative environmental impact 
due to minimisation of hydrocarbon emissions into the atmosphere. Izomalk-2 light naphtha isomerisation 
unit was put into operation in 2010. Commissioning 
of this unit enables an increase in production of Euro 4 and Euro 5 petrol. Processing of oil at deeper levels 
and an increase of petrol production were achieved. 
Isomerisate produced by Izomalk-2 is considered to be the most valuable component for high octane fuel.
Construction of new fuel hydrotreatment facility , a 
large project of OJSC Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery’s 
medium-term investment programme, is being actively 
implemented.The Company implements its environmental policy at its foreign assets, 
too. in 2010, it conducted a comprehensive environmental survey at the 
NiS production facilities to assess their ecological status and industrial 
operations’ environmental impact and identify existing and potential environmental risks. The audit results will help develop short-and long-term programmes to improve environmental conditions at the NiS-operated work sites. Records of the results were submitted to the 
Government of the Republic of Serbia. in a collaborative effort with the 
Serbian government, the Company develops programmes to rehabilitate the contaminated areas and reduce the negative environmental impact (reducing emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere and improving the quality of industrial effluents).112 JSC GAzPROm NEfT

minimising environmental and economic risks during 
acid sludge* disposal is another critical environmental 
task to be resolved at the Omsk Refinery. Specialists 
of Omsk Refinery’s Production Safety Department 
conducted pilot testing of various acid sludge* disposal 
methods in 2010. The results obtained will help define 
the most economically and environmentally effective 
technology.
The programme developed in 2010 by specialists 
of the Production Safety Department and moscow 
Refinery is aimed at decontamination of oil slime 
containing less than 15-30 % hydrocarbons. Upon 
implementation of this programme, the problem of 
disposing of oil slime accumulated from previous 
operations at moscow Refinery will be solved by 2013.
In 2010, geo-ecological research of OJSC moscow 
Refinery’s area and the moscow River’s water 
conservation zone was organised. As a result of the 
research, reliable subsurface hydrocarbon accumulation 
data was acquired and the best technologies 
for rehabilitation of oil-contaminated land were defined. The integrated programme for the refinery’s 
contaminated land and rehabilitation of the River’s 
water conservation zone has commenced.Retail network
The environmental component is present in bulk plant and filling station renovation projects. So, to 
environmentalists’ estimates, introducing petrol vapour 
recovery and recuperation systems will practically enable complete (up to 90-95  %) prevention of petrol vapour 
emissions from filling stations into the atmosphere.
Other marketing enterprises of the Company are 
also proactive in solving environmental issues. This is 
extremely important for Gazprom Neft-Shipping: very strict requirements reflected in the International Safety 
management (IS m) Code are imposed on operations 
within inland sea waters. To achieve compliance with 
the above requirements, the Company developed 
and implemented an integrated safety and quality 
management system and arranged international certification of the quality management system 
according to ISO 9001:2008.
Gazprom Neft-Lubricants LLC developed and 
implemented an integrated management system in accordance with requirements of international standards 
ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 which include 
quality management, environmental management, as well as occupational and industrial safety management. 
Application of International Standards within this 
system covers production and sales of lubricants at Omsk Lubricants Plant and in moscow Central Office. 
The integrated management system should become a critical factor in tuning Gazprom Neft-Lubricants’ activities to satisfy consumers’ expectations and the 
Company’s own needs, assurance of quality , health, 
safety and environmental policy implementation. The most environmentally-friendly form of 
oil slime disposal, bio-utilisation, has already been successfully applied at moscow Refinery 
for several years. This technology is based on the use of a group of microorganisms which decontaminates oil-contaminated waste in a relatively short time. As a result, oil slime transforms into something new: practically non-hazardous soil is formed which is used as technical soil for back-filling roads, filling ravines or making grass-plots. more than 8,500 cubic 
metres of oil slime were disposed of using bio-utilisation technology.
