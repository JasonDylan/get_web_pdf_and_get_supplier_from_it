Amgen 2015 Environmental Sustainability Report Highlights
2
Highlighted by our launch of six innovative products, 
2015 was a year in which Amgen advanced our strategy for long-term growth.  We delivered new and existing medicines for patients in more countries than ever before, executing our ambitious plans even as we made transformational changes to make us stronger and more competitive. As Amgen evolves, we remain committed to being a responsible company. We strive to extend the positive impact our medicines make around the world to our work in the communities in which we operate. We commit significant time, energy, and resources to efforts that make us a better global citizen.
Environmental sustainability is one aspect of Amgen’s 
responsible approach. As a biology-focused company, we have a deep appreciation for the natural environment. We continuously improve operations in a variety of ways to improve our environmental impact. We are making progress toward licensure of our pioneering Next-Generation Biomanufacturing plant in Singapore, which will considerably curb water use, carbon emissions, and the generation of solid waste. In response to drought, we accelerated our already-substantial water conservation efforts at sites in California and Puerto Rico. We have achieved large reductions in carbon emissions from our overall business primarily by making systems more efficient and using less energy. We have evaluated renewable and alternative energy technology options at every major Amgen site and have included renewable and alternative energy projects in our long range plan. We are proud to be recognized externally for our sustainability performance. In 2015, Amgen earned placement on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for a second year and was named to the North America Index for a third year. Amgen placed significantly higher in both the US and Global listings in the Newsweek 2015 Green Rankings compared to previous years.
We have launched a Responsibility section on Amgen.com 
as part of our broader commitment to communicating our non-financial performance.  In addition to this environmental sustainability report, the section contains information on the Amgen Foundation, our Access to Medicine program, corporate giving initiatives, and the health and safety of our staff. 
Just as I value how our staff are motivated by the opportunity 
to make the world a better place, I appreciate that our peers and the public take time to review and assess Amgen’s performance. I invite you to share your thoughts about Amgen’s progress with environmental sustainability through the feedback link on this report website.

The overall aim of our 2020 targets is to protect the environment, improve efficiency, and increase stakeholder 
value. Our targets are designed to track our progress through deliberate efforts—without influence from growth  
or contraction in our business. We created a portfolio of projects and initiatives that we specifically execute to bring results in our target areas. We track the performance of these projects and initiatives against a 2012 baseline, counting results of projects and initiatives confirmed through a formal measurement process.

We are integrating environmental sustainability practices throughout our company’s operations—from 
research and manufacturing practices to the design and construction of facilities. A mix of facility and process optimization practices combined with carefully selected technology advances creates results.
Sustainability in Action
Driving Sustainable Practices  
Throughout the Value Chain
Amgen’s 2020 plan for environmental sustainability is focused on driving sustainable practices in the areas of research, development, and manufacturing; transportation and distribution; commercial operations; sourcing; and products and packaging. By integrating sustainable practices during the design process, we are achieving further efficiencies in our business while continuing to reduce our impact on the environment. 
Conserving a Precious Resource 
Water is vital to life and is a key ingredient in Amgen medicines. Our staff members strive to conserve water in strategic ways that support our business while recognizing our responsibilities to the communities in which we operate. Our two largest sites are situated in locations—California and Puerto Rico—that experienced extreme drought conditions in 2015. We moved quickly to assess and implement short-and long-term strategies to enhance existing water conservation programs at all sites in these locations. Amgen as a whole was able to conser ve 106,000  
cubic meters of water in 2015. 
The Environmental Benefits 
of Manufacturing Advances Amgen has pioneered Next-Generation Biomanufacturing technologies that allow for greater productivity in a footprint that is significantly smaller than a conventional facility. We plan to use this approach for the first time commercially following licensure at our new manufacturing center in Singapore. Compared to a large facility, a Next-Generation plant can provide major reductions in carbon emissions, energy consumption, water use, and solid waste. Advanced technologies for drug product manufacturing and process improvements in conventional biomanufacturing also create conservation gains in addition to improving efficiency and saving financial resources in our business.
Seizing the Opportunity to Expand Recycling 
Biomanufacturing involves the use of many different materials that can be challenging to recycle depending on the local waste management services available. At our manufacturing facility in Rhode Island, staff have waited patiently for the right opportunity to recycle non-regulated manufacturing waste items such as used filters, bio-bags, wave-bags, tubing, and nitrile gloves rather than send them  
to the landfill. When Amgen’s vendor for waste management grew their service to take previously un-recyclable items, process them, and make them into useful items like park benches and curb material, Amgen signed on to send these items to a more environmentally friendly fate. These efforts diverted 90 metric tons of waste from the landfill for recycling.

Amgen staff approach opportunities to make environmental 
improvements with the same enthusiasm and rigor they apply to scientific challenges. Staff-supported improvements in technology and processes have created significant conservation benefits, saved financial resources, and earned many awards over the years. Amgen maintains a yearly Environmental Champions program, which honors numerous staff from around the company for their green actions. 
Reaching Out in the Community 
Amgen staff are avid volunteers, contributing to a number of environmentally beneficial events throughout the year. Various Amgen sites participate annually in the International Coastal Cleanup, a global volunteering opportunity in which participants clear waterways and beaches of trash while collecting data that support the Ocean Conservancy in its goal of trash-free seas. Other environmental volunteering events in which staff participate include Clean Up Australia Day and a work party at Kendall Square in Massachusetts. The National Parks Service and Ventura County honored Amgen volunteers for their commitment to the community and the environment in 2015.The Amgen Foundation is deeply committed to fostering the next generation of scientific innovators, including our support of important initiatives that advance environmental education in our local communities, such as NatureBridge school programs at the Golden Gate National Park campus and in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
Sustainable Commuting 
Amgen supports carpools, vanpools, public transportation vouchers, bicycle commuting, and electric car charging where possible. We tailor our alternative transportation programs to the resources available in the communities where Amgen operates facilities. 
Education for the Environment 
Amgen celebrated Earth Day at most of its US-based locations in 2015. Events encouraged staff to develop environmentally friendly habits both at work and at home in the areas of recycling, composting, waste reduction, energy efficiency, and alternative commuting. Water conservation was of special importance during drought conditions in 2015, and Earth Day events focused on things that staff can do at home and at work to conserve water. Various Amgen sites promoted waste reduction and recycling strategies in support of America Recycles Day. The success of our environmental sustainability plan depends on the creativity and resourcefulness of our 
staff, who demonstrate their commitment to the environment both at work and in their communities.6175

CarbonConserving Resources 
Conserving energy allows Amgen to retain more financial resources for our core business of discovering, developing, manufacturing, and delivering innovative human therapeutics. Amgen has a comprehensive carbon reduction strategy that focuses on eliminating energy use, increasing energy efficiency, and increasing the proportion of renewable and alternative energy used. We complete utilities projects that provide substantial returns for both energy savings and carbon reduction across our network of facilities around the world. Two solar projects are currently scheduled for implementation. We have realized millions in cost savings and reduced carbon emissions by 97,500 metric tons, or 23 percent, from 2008 through 2015 by implementing energy conservation and carbon reduction projects.
We are making progress towards our sales fleet carbon reduction target, 
raising the minimum fuel efficiency standard for vehicles year by year. We continue to expand the range of fuel-efficient vehicle choices available for mobile staff—and to rotate out less fuel-efficient vehicles.

Reducing Waste; Saving Water
Amgen has improved the rate of recycling from 35 percent to 52 percent 
from 2007 through 2015. To build on the success of existing programs and uncover new ways to stop waste at the source, we continue to analyze waste audits conducted at our largest sites. We use data from these audits to shape initiatives for recycling and waste reduction.
Amgen continues to assess water use and employ data-driven approaches 
to identify new opportunities to capture water savings, especially at our largest sites located in drought-prone geographies. We integrate water-saving practices and technologies such as smart irrigation systems, low-water landscaping, and waterless urinals. A key component of Amgen’s water conservation program is a wastewater treatment plant at our manufacturing site in Puerto Rico that has enabled an average of 70 percent of the treated wastewater to be recycled on-site each year. Energy conservation projects often provide water conservation benefits. 3,000

Environmental Notices of Violation (NOVs) (w) # NOV 8 2 2 2 6 1Summary of Data14Summary of Data—Notes
(p) Environmental notices of violation (NOVs) reported that resulted from agency inspections.(a)Amgen has included data from 20 facilities covering energy and carbon, water, and waste. The facilities represent approximately 94 percent of Amgen’s 
worldwide facility space based on total square feet. Included facilities are in Thousand Oaks, California, US; Greenwich, Rhode Island, US; Boulder and Longmont, 
Colorado, US; Seattle and Bothell, Washington, US; Juncos, Puerto Rico, US; Louisville, Kentucky, US; South San Francisco, California, US; Cambridge and 
Woburn, Massachusetts, US; Burnaby, Canada; Breda, Netherlands; Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge, United Kingdom; Sao Paolo, Brazil; and Yenisbosna and Sekerpinar, Turkey. This includes leased buildings where we have operational control over building infrastructure, including utilities.  
In 2011, Amgen acquired a facility in São Paulo. In 2012, Amgen acquired four companies: Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, deCODE genetics, and Mustafa 
Nevzat Pharmaceuticals. In 2013 Amgen acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals. No data will be included for our Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, deCODE genetics,  or Onyx Pharmaceuticals in this report, as we are still working through the integration process for these facilities.
(b)Measurement and verification of conservation and reduction projects for energy and carbon, water, and waste are based on adaptation of the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings Volume 1, EVO 10000-1.2007, 
April 2007. Project measurements are conducted using reasonable means, including direct measurements and scientific estimations as appropriate. Values for  
conservation and reduction projects represent year-over-year, cumulative and continuing avoidance based on a 2007 baseline, then rebaselined in 2012 to match  
the next generation 2020 Target design. Results from conservation and reduction projects from sites in Brazil and Turkey are not included in the 2015 report.
(c)Immaterial changes to 2007–15 data may have occurred due to refinements in calculations. All changes have been confirmed through a documented change control process.
(d)Direct energy use results from the operation of equipment that is owned or controlled by Amgen at the facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of natural gas, propane, and diesel in boilers, furnaces, and HVAC are recorded from utility bills or purchase records. Data on the use of diesel in emergency generators are recorded 
from purchase records or meter readings and, in some cases, estimated from run-hours. Utility bills recorded in units of volume are converted to energy by using the 
Global Reporting Initiative Version 3.1, EN3 table, to convert volumes of primary sources (natural gas, diesel), or from specific fuel analysis data (diesel used in Juncos, Puerto Rico), and the US Energy Information Administration/Annual Energy Review Table A1 (propane). Energy from emergency generators recorded as run-hours is 
estimated using the manufacturer’s specified fuel-feed rate for each generator.
(e)Indirect energy use results from purchased energy in the forms of electricity and steam at the Amgen facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of electricity 
and steam are recorded from utility bills. Utility bills for purchased steam that are recorded in units of mass (i.e., ‘lb steam’) are converted to energy by using the 
latent heat of evaporation from the saturated steam tables, then dividing by the efficiency of the supplier’s steam generator.
(f)Scope 1 carbon emissions result from direct energy sources defined in note (d). Additional Scope 1 Carbon emissions from our US sales fleet, executive air fleet, 
and fugitive emissions from chillers, coolers, and HVAC are found in the Other Carbon category in this data summary. Carbon data from natural gas sources 
are calculated using regional specific emission factors from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 (US weighted average) for all US sites; from the Ireland UFCCC 
for Amgen’s facility in Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; from U.K. Defra/DECC’s 110819 Guidelines for Amgen’s facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge); from the NL Agency standard CO
2 emission factors for Amgen’s facility in the Netherlands (Breda); and from the Methodology for Reporting 
2013 Ministry of Environment Victoria, BC, 2013, for Amgen’s facility in Burnaby, Canada. Carbon emissions data from propane and diesel fuel sources (except Amgen’s facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico) are calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (August 2012). 
Carbon from diesel use in Amgen’s Juncos, Puerto Rico, facility are calculated using specific fuel analysis information and from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-1. 
Carbon data from direct energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (Jul 2009). Scope 1 emissions that are not included in this data summary include process-related emissions from cell respiration (carbon as a 
by-product) and pH adjustments (CO
2 injection). Analysis of these sources in 2013 showed that cell respiration and emissions from pH adjustments are negligible 
(less than 0.1 percent of our total carbon emissions).
(g)Scope 2 carbon emissions result from indirect energy sources defined in note (e). Carbon data from purchased electricity are calculated using emission factors 
from US EPA eGRID 2012 for all US locations except Amgen’s facility in Puerto Rico, which has been determined using EPA GHG Report YE 2012 for Power 
Suppliers in Puerto Rico; from the Greenhouse Gas Division, Environment Canada (2006 data)-V.1.0 (April 2009) for Amgen’s facility in Burnaby, Canada; and 
from specific utility annual providers’ reports for Amgen facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge), the Netherlands (Breda), and Dun Laoghaire, Ireland. Carbon data from purchased steam are calculated using the Emission Factor for Natural Gas as identified in US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 
(US weighted average) for Amgen’s facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Carbon data from indirect energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission 
factors from US EPA eGRID2007 Version 1.1 for US facilities.General

factors from US EPA eGRID2007 Version 1.1 for US facilities.(h)The Other Carbon category contains additional Scope 1 and Scope 3 carbon emissions that are tracked. Carbon emissions from our executive air fleet are calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Transport-Fuel-Use (August 2012). Carbon emissions from our  
US sales fleet are calculated using emission factors from the GHG Protocol Emission Factors for Petrol passenger cars (volume) (GHG Protocol) = 8.81  
kg/gal. Fuel use and mileage data are collected at the pump for each vehicle. Carbon emissions from our commercial business travel are calculated by Amgen’s travel provider using the Defra tool. Carbon emissions from Amgen’s material transportation have been provided by the carrier using its own  
specific methods. Fugitive emissions from process equipment (e.g., refrigerant from refrigeration and HVAC equipment) are calculated using emission  
factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Transport-Fuel-Use (August 2012). Processes are in place to maintain chillers, coolers,  
and HVAC equipment to prevent unintended emissions.
(i)Scope 3 carbon emissions are a consequence of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company. Scope 3  carbon emissions that are currently tracked include emissions from Amgen’s commercial business travel (air and rail) and material transportation.
(j)Commercial business travel was not tracked in 2007 or 2008. Material transportation was not tracked from 2007 to 2011. The accuracy of carbon  emissions tracking from chillers, coolers, and HVAC improved in 2013 and will now be reported going forward.
(k) Immaterial discrepancy between values for total water fate and total water withdrawal is due to rounding and compilation of individual facility totals.
(l)Recycling rate is the proportion of waste that is recycled, composted, and reused compared with the total volume of routine, nonhazardous and hazardous  waste generated. Diversion from landfill is the proportion of waste that is incinerated (both for energy recovery and not), landfilled, and treated compared  
with the total routine, nonhazardous waste generated.
(m)Treatment means the physical, thermal, chemical, or biological processes that change the characteristics of the waste in order to reduce its volume or  
hazardous nature, facilitate its handling, or enhance recovery.
(n) Nonroutine waste constitutes waste generated outside the normal operations of our facilities and consists mainly of construction and demolition waste.Other Carbon

Forward-Looking Statements 
This brochure contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, 
other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including those related to our environmental sustainability program design; expected environmental sustainability goals, targets, plans, focus areas, savings or progress towards any of the same; current and future R&D, manufacturing, commercialization, infrastructure or other workplace-related processes, improvements or practices and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this brochure and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected 
by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.Amgen Inc.
