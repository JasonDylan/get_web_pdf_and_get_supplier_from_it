Overview
CSR at Campbell: Promoting global wellness and nutrition while building a sustainable 
environment and honoring our role in society from farm to the family
The Significance of CSR Reporting
This report is a critical testament to our overarching corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy and commitment to honoring our role as sustainable producers. Communicating to our employees and external stakeholders is an ongoing process today that involves much more diligence and engagement than publishing a single annual report. However, the process of reporting forces a critical look at our actual performance and an accounting of our actions, which in turn ensures we remain accountable to our corporate, social and environmental stakeholders.
This report is the latest segment of a conversation that began more than 140 years ago, when our Company’s founders first 
started canning quality vegetables and soups from a small warehouse in Camden, New Jersey. Today, reporting is but one element of a much richer conversation among our employees, customers, consumers — and everyone else connected with Campbell Soup Company and our family of brands — about the role of a food and beverage company in our society — its impact, contributions and obligations.
We know not to be reactive, but strategically proactive. With multiple new trends emerging almost daily, at its core, responsible 
corporate behavior has focused on accountability, transparency and engagement. For companies in the food and beverage sector, however, there are a number of additional dynamics that contribute to the overall picture. Some issues unique to our sector, for example, include sustainable agriculture, responsible sourcing, promotion of human health and sound nutrition, and responsiveness to consumers’ ever-changing expectations of the foods they choose for themselves and their families. 
At Campbell, we strive to address each of these issues through a lifecycle lens — from start to end.
Defining Context
Because CSR and sustainability have different definitions among different stakeholders, it is important to provide some context 
on how we view these terms at Campbell.
At the core, CSR and sustainability at Campbell Soup Company mean:– Advancing global wellness and nutrition;– Helping build a more sustainable environment; and– Honoring our role in society from the farm to the family.More broadly, we believe corporate social responsibility and sustainability are integrated business platforms that build long- 
term shareowner value. These platforms foster innovation, drive operational efficiency, improve environmental performance, reduce costs, and strengthen our employees’ relationships with our customers, and ultimately create business advantage.
We expect our Company to be judged not only on its financial performance but also on its commitment to CSR and 
sustainability. We believe firmly that our consumers, customers, employees and investors expect no less from us as we head into a time of fewer resources and multiple challenges. We believe the importance of this commitment will only increase.
As you peruse the next few pages, which will offer a quantified lens at our progress in FY2012, we invite you to join the 
conversation and become our partners in becoming responsible corporate citizens.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  301 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
CEO Letter
A CEO perspective on our commitments to our 
stakeholders, our journey toward being a more sustainable company and creating long-term value in society
Dear Campbell Stakeholders,Welcome to Campbell’s latest Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) report. I’m pleased to have this opportunity to update you on our progress and share my perspective with you.
I’m encouraged to report that Campbell continues to 
strengthen its long-standing commitment to creating long-term value in society by becoming a more sustainable and socially responsible company.
I believe two key elements are required to implement a successful CSR 
strategy, and Campbell is diligently advancing both fronts. The first is to actively integrate CSR into how we conduct our business and ensure that these concepts are not stand- alone initiatives. The other is to effectively engage our employees by making CSR a part of their performance expectations. By bringing these two important facets together, CSR becomes an integral part of our culture.
“
 T
o me, the professional and personal elements of our successful CSR work 
came together beautifully one day this past October at an elementary 
school in Camden, New Jersey. The experience brought to life my personal mission that leadership is service and reinforced the true power of giving back.”
The Campbell Leadership Team and I served a healthy lunch to 150 students 
at Holy Name School, to help celebrate national Make a Difference Day. Our executive team and Campbell chefs created a lunch that was nutritious, delicious and, importantly, fun for the students — and for us. It featured turkey sandwiches on Pepperidge Farm Goldfish bread, Healthy Request Tomato soup and gelatin made with V8 V-Fusion juice. The lunch met the federal standards for both healthy and affordable lunches. It was a memorable day for everyone involved. I had the chance to see the excitement of so many kids. Their faces lit up as they ate — one child enthusiastically called it a “5-star lunch.” I also witnessed our leaders walking the talk, serving the children in Camden, New Jersey, the place we’ve called home for more than 140 years.
The experience I had in Camden that day is not unusual. As I travel 
throughout the Campbell world, I hear from our employees about their pride — in our company and also for their communities. I believe it is part of Campbell DNA to be involved in the communities where we live and work. Our employees are generous with their time and expertise, and readily serve as active participants improving people’s lives in their hometowns. Whether as community group members, volunteer firefighters, school coaches, or Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  401 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
however they chose to get involved, our employees are truly making a 
difference.
On a recent trip, I had the chance to visit our largest manufacturing facility in 
Napoleon, Ohio, and tour our new 60-acre solar field, one of the largest solar panel installations in the United States. As I stood on that ground, it became clear how sustainability is a win-win proposition. This source of renewable energy will significantly lower greenhouse gases while providing our plant with 15% of its power at a lower cost. We know that improving environmental performance is good for our business. More importantly, it’s good for our planet as we work to preserve the environment for the generations that follow us.
At Campbell, we are hard at work executing a new strategic framework 
designed to make us a more innovative, balanced and responsive company. I believe that as we build a better company under this strategic vision, we also have the opportunity to become one of the most socially responsible consumer goods companies in the world. We have a long-standing commitment to CSR, spanning more than 140 years. We are proud of our past, but are focused forward on consumers and ahead to create our future.
We are also continuing to work to strengthen the core elements of our 
culture and our performance evaluations. We’ve captured our commitment in a statement we call “The Way We Work” that states “We will positively contribute to building and sustaining a safe, diverse, inclusive, engaged and socially responsible workplace focused on delivering business results with integrity.” Each Campbell employee has a responsibility to bring this statement to life in their own way, again marking the important intersection of the professional and personal aspects of our CSR strategy.
Last year, we made significant progress against the 2020 destination goals 
outlined in our 2010 CSR report. In the following pages, we have endeavored to present a candid review of our efforts and achievements toward those goals. While we are proud of our achievements, we know that we have much more work to do. We are committed to nourish consumers’ lives “their way” with tasty, affordable, convenient food and beverages while helping to make our communities and environment better. I encourage you to learn more about our initiatives by reviewing the 2013 update of our CSR Report. We hope you’ll share your comments and feedback with us at:  csr_feedback@campbellsoup.com.
In the years to come, I look forward to celebrating with you the ongoing 
success of this great company.
Best,
 
Denise M. Morrison President and Chief Executive Officer

Key Impacts and Opportunities
Understanding the impact of our products, from farm to fork
Campbell’s global business and family of brands have multiple impacts within and across their 
product lifecycle from farm to fork. As a food and beverage company, our ingredients are grown on farms and are inherently renewable, but how we manage these resources today and in the future is critical.
From agriculture and resource management to product innovation, nutrition and packaging, and extending to distribution and 
consumption, we impact our employees, the communities we live and work in, our customers, consumers and suppliers, and a wide range of other stakeholders that interact with our people and products. We look at every step in our operations and every personal interaction as an opportunity to advance our performance and benefit to consumers and society.01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS

Management Strategy and Analysis
Campbell’s approach to strategic CSR and sustainability management and integration
The Campbell Mission: Nourishing people’s lives everywhere, every day.
Our mission statement is an incredible tool in informing our decision-making as well as inspiring 
us to produce high-quality, wholesome products that are trusted the world over and to make a positive difference in the world we live in.
In keeping with our company mission, we continually look to making our world’s future more nourished and sustainable.  
To honor that, we have reinforced new strategic business drivers. Campbell will be:
A More Innovative Company
We will be critically focused on consumer-driven innovation in products and packaging as the primary driver of organic growth.
A More Balanced Company
We will drive our company’s growth by providing a wide array of delicious, nutritious and convenient products across a growing global consumer base.
A More Responsive Company
We will be far better positioned for engagement with new and growing consumer groups.
Our cultural focus is summed up in The Way We Work, which inspires us to build a safe, diverse, inclusive, engaged and 
responsible company — we realize the weight of those words! — that conducts business and delivers strong results with the highest standards of integrity.
Defining CSR and Sustainability Strategy
Each year we conduct a formal strategic planning process in which we reassess and refine our core business strategies — including CSR, sustainability and community affairs. At Campbell, these are core platforms that are incorporated into key business and functional-unit strategic plans with three-year time horizons and annual performance goals that then lead to executive and personal performance objectives.
Strategic CSR: Campbell Nourishes
Our strategic planning process begins with a broad situation assessment, where we examine our key internal and external drivers and challenges to our CSR and sustainability strategy, including, but not limited to, key trends in the sustainability  and the evolving expectations of our stakeholders.
Our strategic plan for CSR and sustainability rests on four key pillars:
– Nourishing Our Planet: Environmental stewardship– Nourishing Our Consumers: Our interactions with customers and consumers– Nourishing Our Neighbors: Community service– Nourishing Our Employees: Building an extraordinary workplace
As part of our annual situation assessment, we not only review our performance in each of these areas, but also take into 
consideration external trends and drivers in the marketplace, and our stakeholders, through a multifaceted lens.
We analyze a matrix of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to help us fine-tune our goals, strategies and 
operational priorities in each of our four primary CSR platforms.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  1001 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
This process of self-evaluation and critical introspection helped us identify several characteristics that are important to long-
term success. These include:
– A shared perspective on CSR across the company;– Definition of core metrics and long-term performance goals; and– Recognition that our executives and employees must have the necessary resources and tools to activate our strategy.
We declared that our strategy should provide for active stakeholder engagement; that our practices, performance and results 
be transparent; and, most importantly, that our efforts be shaped by a focus that is unique to Campbell and the impact we  can have.
Materiality Analysis
Carefully examining a myriad of internal and external issues that help shape our CSR and 
sustainability programs
Defining materiality is an important component of an effective CSR and sustainability program. 
We believe that this process of examining the internal and external drivers of our purpose and mission is crucial. This also helps us determine which areas align with marketplace and stakeholder priorities. There are many areas in which Campbell’s long-term business success aligns with marketplace and stakeholder priorities, including:
–  Sus tainable agriculture: Our suppliers depend on us to educate them, engage with them on new technology, resource and 
energy conservation, etc., and to include them in our business’ long-term strategy. In fact, we believe that we owe them those 
things.
– 
 R
esponsible sourcing: Choosing our suppliers — who have an undeniable role in furthering our mission of nourishing our 
consumers’ lives — is critical for our mission to be a success.
– 
 Pr
omotion of human health and sound, yet affordable, nutrition: Millions remain without access to nutritious food choices, 
while obesity continues to increase. We seek to change that by promoting sound healthy and affordable choices.
We believe that carefully considering these areas of alignment can lead to a more informed CSR strategy and help drive both positive social impact and long-term business success.
While most materiality issues remain relatively stable year to year, we view the monitoring and assessment process as a key 
organizational learning function. In addition to our ongoing issues monitoring and assessment processes, we conduct several rigorous efforts to inform and refine our CSR materiality assessment. This year’s process included:
Formal meetings: We held formal meetings with social and advocacy investment stakeholders and researchers to better 
understand and engage on issues of priority to them.
Community polls: We polled our community and external partners involved in our childhood hunger and obesity initiative, 
learning that issues involving our youth remain at the top of the priority list of our community stakeholders, and that, while all issues were ranked high, an immediate concern such as hunger ranked higher than education or the environment in our communities.
Consumer surveys: We fielded another survey of Campbell consumers, asking them to rank issues by materiality and provide 
open-ended comments on our business and CSR strategy. Here, too, responses were stable.
In-depth research: Dr. Daniel Sonke, Manager of Agriculture Sustainability Programs, conducted a series of approximately 50 
interviews to examine priority focus areas for our suppliers. Interviewees included farmers, agriculture suppliers, retail and food service customers, NGOs and global Campbell employees.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  1101 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS

governance structure, with the resources and authority to make efficient decisions, establish accountabilities and drive execution.

Each team has a formal charter, mission statement and indicators of success. Four of the teams are focused on key content 
areas:
1.
 En
vironmental sustainability;
2.
 
Community affairs;
3.
 Building an e
xtraordinary workplace; and
4.

Managing Performance
CSR and sustainability are integrated across business units, functional strategic plans and 
balanced scorecards
Balanced Scorecard
Campbell employs a “balanced scorecard” process to define annual objectives and measure the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as in individual business units. Goals defined in the scorecard fall within four key measurement areas with respect to the Company’s financial, strategic, operational and marketplace objectives. The CSR, sustainability and community affairs organization maintains an additional corporate balanced scorecard that addresses strategic, operational, internal and external metrics.
Through our balanced scorecard, we assess not only whether we achieve our objectives, but also how  we achieve them.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  1601 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
The Way We Work: Integration of CSR
Further, CSR and sustainability metrics are included in categories across Campbell’s strategic planning process and are cultural 
components of our individual performance objective process: The Way We Work.
These are the primary tools used to drive accountability and judge success on annual performance expectations. Objectives 
range from specific steps in strategy development to individual reporting milestones, such as establishment of agreed-upon metrics, expansion of community service programs, workplace diversity and inclusion, supplier diversity and safety.
Some examples of objectives in the CSR/sustainability balanced scorecard from FY2012 include:
– Advance operational performance in key metrics and execute an additional renewable project– Develop stakeholder-informed sustainable agriculture strategy– Define communications and metrics for the Campbell’s Healthy Camden Program– Drive alignment between Campbell’s community programs and its business mission– Effectively leverage value of memberships in external organizations– Deepen strategic relationships with suppliers and customers on sustainability– Extend reach and depth of CSR communication vehicles– Effectively execute and grow employee- and community-related CSR programming– Update and/or publish key policy statements such as the Supplier Code of Conduct

Corporate Governance and Ethics
Our long-standing commitment to winning in the marketplace and the workplace in compliance 
with the law and the highest ethical standards
Ethical Purpose
Campbell employees are expected to practice the highest ethical standards in every decision and process they deliver. Our multifaceted Winning With Integrity program provides the systems and tools to help our employees win while honoring Campbell’s distinguished heritage.
All Campbell associates share the responsibility to ensure that our pledge to win with integrity in the marketplace, the 
workplace and the community is fulfilled every day, through each and every action they take.
Corporate Governance
To pursue the highest standards in corporate governance, our Board has long been led by an independent, non-executive chairman. Our goals are reflected in our Corporate Governance Standards, which are evaluated annually with systematic procedures in place for assessing the effectiveness of the Board and Board committees.
Corporate Governance: Our Board of Directors
Purpose & History:
Campbell’s commitment to responsible corporate citizenship and a sustainable business model begins with our Board of Directors. Consisting of 14 independent members and one executive director, our Board operations are managed by an independent, non-executive chairman. All of our directors stand for election annually.
In FY2012, the full Board convened six times, the four standing committees met a total of 29 times and all directors attended at 
least 75% of scheduled Board meetings and the sessions of the committees on which they served. A segment of every Board meeting was allocated exclusively for the directors to confer on relevant issues without the participation of management.
Diverse Board Makeup:
The diversity of our directors’ perspectives and experiences contributes exponentially to sound corporate governance. Our current Board includes five women, two African Americans, a director from India, and a director born and raised in Argentina. 
Our directors represent a cross-section of industries, including the food industry, consumer products, financial services, retail, 
packaging, finance and international businesses.
Responsibilities:
The Board focuses on areas that are important to shareowners, such as strategy, leadership development, director recruitment, external development and executive compensation. Directors have numerous opportunities to interact with individual members of Campbell’s senior management team, including periodic visits to plant facilities and customer locations to assess operations and gain additional insights into the Company’s business.
The Campbell Board is also extremely focused on enterprise risk management and has a framework in place that helps assign 
specific accountabilities to the Board. The responsibilities reflected in the framework are included in meeting agendas for the Board and its committees, with the Audit Committee reviewing the entire framework annually.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  2001 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
Risk Management
The Process:
Campbell has an extensive Risk and Crisis Management system in place, with Senior Vice President and Chief Legal and Public 
Affairs Officer Ellen Kaden and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer Craig Owens heading the function. They report directly to the CEO.
Additionally, the Vice President of Environmental Programs and the Vice President of Public Affairs and Corporate 
Responsibility present the Company’s progress and status regarding environmental sustainability to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors annually, focusing on the Company’s progress on energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, energy conservation projects, water use, wastewater treatment and solid waste recycling, and further, how these efforts are impacting climate change.
Public Policy and Engagement
Our commitment to open dialogue, thorough disclosure and accountability in key  
regulatory issues
Encouraging Dialogue
Campbell participates actively in the discussion of local, state, national and international public policy issues that are relevant to our business strategies and operations, from food safety and advertising to healthcare and international trade.
We also contribute to public dialogue on policy issues through our memberships in food and related industry trade associations.
Disclosure
Full Disclosure...
Committed to industry-wide transparency, we emphasize candid dialogue and open interactions with government agencies  
and officials. Campbell’s U.S. lobbying disclosure reports are filed with the appropriate state and federal authorities under the U.S. Lobby Disclosure Act.
We also file disclosure reports with the Election Law Enforcement Commission for lobbying activity with the State of New Jersey.
...and Built-in Accountability
Campbell has a formal set of Political Accountability Guidelines and related disclosures, which are available on the company’s 
public website.
In the U.S., Campbell does not endorse any individual political party or candidate, but we do encourage voluntary political 
activity by our employees. Our employees can contribute funds to political candidates and organizations engaged in policy issues that are important to our Company, such as food manufacturing standards and worker safety, through Campbell’s Political Action Committee (PAC), a segregated fund that is affiliated with the Company. Contributions made by the Campbell PAC are publicly reported, in accordance with federal law.

FEC website.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  2101 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS

Winning With Integrity
Providing the resources, tools and guidance that enable our employees to understand and 
comply with our ethical standards and expectations for business conduct
Beginning with Integrity...
“ W e will compete vigorously, but we will be honest, lawful and fair in our dealings with 
employees, customers, consumers, communities and all others whose lives we touch. This bedrock principle drives all that we do and illuminates all that we aspire to achieve. Our employees are expected to honor our Company’s commitment to integrity at all times, everywhere in the world.”Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  2201 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
Campbell’s Winning With Integrity program provides the resources, tools and guidance that enable our employees to 
understand and comply with our standards and expectations for business conduct. The program includes, among other things:
– An interactive website;– Extensive written materials; and– A comprehensive, worldwide training program.
...Strengthening with Principal Codes and Policies
Campbell’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is the foundation document of the Winning With Integrity program. The Code 
outlines our Company’s basic standards and expectations, highlights important Campbell policies, and summarizes certain fundamental legal requirements that our employees must follow at work. It also provides guidance about other resources that employees can use to answer any questions or concerns they might have regarding a potential legal or ethical dilemma.
Respecting the diversity of our workforce, the Code is available in multiple languages, with every Campbell employee receiving 
a personal copy at the time of hire.
...and Ensuring Compliance = Winning With Integrity
Our CEO is instrumental in keeping our worldwide workforce aware of corporate policy statements on specific compliance issues as they occur. Business units issue other policies and guidelines throughout the year, as needed. A central Index of Standards and Procedures for Compliance, maintained by the Legal Department, provides a comprehensive inventory of the policies, procedures and guidelines in use at the corporate level and within the individual businesses and functions. Similarly, a companion Central Index of Mechanisms for Monitoring and Auditing Compliance is maintained by the Legal Department to confirm responsibility for ascertaining that the policies and procedures are being followed.
Revised corporate policies and guidelines are issued every year. Existing policy statements that are regularly reviewed and 
revised as needed include:
– Code of Business Conduct and Ethics– Anti-Bribery Policy– Guidelines and Commitment Concerning Advertising to Children– Environmental Sustainability Policy– Human Rights Principles– Political Accountability Guidelines– Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual
Education and Training: Employee Empowerment & Innovation
Campbell provides comprehensive training for every employee on core issues such as ethics and compliance and risk-based 
training that is tailored to individual roles in the Company and the issues associated with their specific job responsibilities.
As part of the Winning With Integrity program, all employees are required to complete annual training on our Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics. This training is available online or in person, and is offered in 13 languages.
Campbell’s Integrity Hotline
Campbell’s Integrity Hotline is a service through which complaints and concerns can be reported to the Company or the Board on a confidential and/or anonymous basis. Access to the hotline is available through a secure Internet website and toll-free from all countries in which Campbell does business.
To comply with special requirements of the European Union, and in certain EU member states, we maintain a separate hotline 
service for employees in France, Belgium and Germany. The availability of this Integrity Hotline is widely publicized and encouraged among our employees, with all reports to our hotlines investigated.
Evolution of the Program
Our Winning With Integrity program is continuously assessed and adjusted to reflect developments in our business.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  2301 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
Stakeholder Engagement
Winning With Our Stakeholders: Recognizing the critical importance of engaging our multiple 
stakeholders in business strategy
Often the missing piece of business strategy and consumer orientation is true engagement. Our 
team at Campbell recognizes the competitive advantage we achieve from engaging our diverse spectrum of stakeholders. To that end, we use multiple approaches to gather diverse external perspectives on our business activities.
IDENTIFY: In addition to third-party consumer and customer research, our Consumer and Customer Insights and Consumer 
Affairs departments and our Customer Relationship Managers help us identify the priorities of our marketplace stakeholders.
SET PROCESSES: Specific processes are used to engage suppliers, employees, investors and external thought leaders in a range 
of topics, including health and nutrition, food safety and quality, environmental stewardship, community relations, and diversity and inclusion.
BENCHMARKING: We conduct benchmarking for leadership performance within and outside our sector and interact with many 
trade and issue management groups worldwide. To complement the rich input we receive through our existing stakeholder engagement models, in FY2011 we conducted specific surveys on CSR and sustainability with consumers, suppliers and community stakeholders. With more than 230 Campbell consumers taking the time to score different topics in terms of their relevance to them and to society in general, we received incredible input and hundreds of direct comments.
Direct Market Feedback:
A few conclusions of our most recent CSR consumer survey indicated that:
1.
  S
trategic Community Initiatives: Giving back to the community is something that is expected. Food companies should also 
help minimize hunger in the community.
2.
  C
ommitment to Food Safety: A commitment to food safety should be listed as a priority for Campbell Soup in our CSR 
reporting to the public.
3.
  Prioritizing A
ffordability: Manufacturing and marketing products in a way to keep food affordable, while maintaining 
shareowner value, should be included as a priority for our Company.
4.
  Championing Nutrition:
 Improving the nutritional content of food should also be a focus area, including a focus on  
using all-natural ingredients.
And here are some of the ways we are responding.
Public-Private Partnerships
Campbell’s business leaders serve as trustees or members of the advisory boards of many organizations engaged in the CSR 
and sustainability agenda, including, for example, the following:
– American College of Nutrition– American Council for Fitness and Nutrition– Association for Consumer Research– Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship– Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia– Childhood Obesity 180– European Cluster for Fruit and Vegetable Innovation– Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network– Food Allergy Research and Resource Program– Food Bank of South JerseyCampbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  2 401 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
– Food for All
– Foundation for Strategic Sourcing– Graham Sustainability Institute at the University of Michigan– Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation– Net Impact– Philabundance– Society of Consumer Affairs Professionals (SOCAP)– Local United Way Chapters
Scientific Advisory Panel
Campbell is leveraging a Scientific Advisory Panel made up of experts in Nutrition and Food Science from leading universities 
in the U.S. and Europe to provide external perspective on plant-based nutrition (e.g., vegetables, grains, fruits, spices). The panel has been designed to provide strategic insights on current and emerging science around plants, including their nutrient/ phytochemical composition and potential health benefits that could be derived from these ingredients and compounds.
The panel also provides valuable perspective on how formulation and processing can be utilized to optimize health benefits and 
create products with consumer appeal, interacting directly with senior executives biannually and on an as “as-needed” basis for specific initiatives.

Overview
Offering consumers a choice of nutritious, delicious and convenient products to suit individual 
lifestyle and dietary goals
At the heart of Campbell’s mission statement, Nourishing People’s Lives Everywhere, Every 
Day, is our commitment to Nourishing Our Consumers their way. Earning and maintaining our 
consumers’ trust is, and always will be, our paramount focus.
This begins with providing a wholesome product portfolio. For more than a century, we have dedicated ourselves to nourishing 
consumers by providing affordable, nutritious, high-quality, convenient and great-tasting foods.
As a leading food and beverage company, we routinely monitor industry trends so that we can provide consumers with 
products that meet their needs. Today’s consumers are increasingly interested in products that help them get more fruits, vegetables and whole grains into their diet or those that can help them manage their weight or that fit in a heart-healthy lifestyle.
To do that we focus on:
– Enhancing the safety and quality of our products;– Offering a variety of affordable and convenient foods;– Using consumer feedback and market research to improve our products;– Providing value-added services, such as recipes, in our advertising and on our websites; and– Marketing our products responsibly.
Campbell also understands that it is our responsibility to help educate our consumers. Through our Campbell Nutrition website, 
advertising and other communications, we provide consumers with information about how our products can fit into a balanced diet. This includes providing consumers easy access to recipes, meal plans, product search tools and nutrition information. An important component of this effort is to provide accurate and reliable labels with ingredients and nutrition information to help our consumers make informed purchasing decisions. In 2012, we agreed to participate in the industry-wide Facts Up Front initiative to provide front-of-label nutrition information.

Healthy and Nutritious Products
Providing our customers and consumers with choices: 
nutritious and affordable options for families
As a food company, we recognize the role of food in 
maintaining and advancing health and personal well-being. To better meet the needs of our consumers, we will continue to leverage emerging science and technologies to provide an array of healthful product choices.
Our goal is to provide consumers with nutritious, high-quality and great-
tasting products that can be part of a healthy lifestyle.
Consumers are increasingly seeking healthier products to incorporate into 
their daily diets. In FY2012, total U.S. sales of healthy products exceeded $2.2 billion, which is 30% more than FY2009 sales.
Promoting Healthier Foods
As part of our commitment to providing consumers with healthy food choices, we continue to look for opportunities to advance the nutrition and wellness attributes of our products. We do this by providing vegetable and fruit servings, whole grains, fiber, vitamins and minerals that, according to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, are under-consumed in the U.S. diet.
Balanced Nutrition 
According to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, poor diet and physical inactivity are the most significant factors contributing to the obesity epidemic and are associated with major causes of morbidity and mortality, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension and Type II diabetes. To help our consumers achieve a balanced diet, Campbell offers hundreds of products that have been prepared with less fat, saturated fat, sodium and sugar.
In the U.S. alone, we offer:
- More than 390 products that are low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol;- More than 300 products (excluding Pepperidge Farm cakes, cookies, 
croutons, crackers, stuffing, and pastries) with reduced levels of sodium

Communicating Health and Wellness
Campbell is committed to providing our consumers with the nutrition information, resources and tools they need through 
integrated communications across brand and corporate platforms, including advertising, digital destinations and corporate partnerships. This ensures our consumers have access to this information regardless of how they engage with our company. Here are a couple of examples of our FY2012 best practices in nutrition communication.
Kid Balance: Health and Wellness Curriculum
The Labels for Education program, along with industry experts including Life Time Fitness, and with the help of our Campbell nutritionists, has created 10 different standards-based modules that provide a holistic approach to health and wellness through nutrition and physical activity education. Each module teaches children how to lead a more physically healthy and balanced life. The Kid Balance curriculum is a program appropriate for children 6–11 years of age and is available to participating Labels for Education schools.
Product Innovation
Continuously striving to develop new food products that meet or exceed expectations for being 
great-tasting, affordable and nutritious
Campbell understands the need to innovate continuously and develop new products that meet or 
exceed the expectations of our consumers. We strive not only to develop new products but also enhance the quality of existing products.
Our manufacturing processes are designed to maintain nutritional value and preserve the quality of our wholesome ingredients. 
As part of our new strategic plan launched in 2011, we are devoting significantly greater resources to disruptive innovation that will expand our product and packaging platforms to reach new consumers.
Our Definition of Innovation

– That results in sustainable competitive advantage, or eliminates competitive disadvantage; and– Enhances the value of the Company.
Our Principles of Innovation
1.  E very employee in every role is expected to have an innovation mindset to improve our products, services, systems and 
processes.

We identify, prioritize and resource the innovation initiatives that are most likely to ensure we reach our desired destinations.4. We ensure that all innovation initiatives adhere to disciplined principles and processes.
Using Nutrition Science to Enhance Food Nutrition
Research
Campbell has a long history of conducting and supporting research focused on advancing better nutrition, food preparation 
and dietary patterns. Using a multidisciplinary approach of nutrition, food, sensory, culinary and packaging science, we offer consumers healthier choices that meet their uncompromising taste expectations.
Our Research and Development department continually monitors trends to improve our products to better meet the needs of 
our consumers. Our goal is to help consumers reduce negative components in their diets, close nutrition gaps, maintain healthy weight and protect heart health, while emphasizing vegetable and grain nutrition.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  3 702 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS
Technology
We do this in several ways, including deploying cutting-edge technologies and working with external partners, such as suppliers 
and universities, on research and the latest innovation. In fact, Campbell has increased its focus on innovation sourcing through the sponsorship of multiple Innovation Fairs at our locations around the world. These fairs are demonstration exhibits targeted toward specific categories or objectives and source ideas from employees as well as external suppliers and vendors.
Ideas for Innovation
Our online innovation platform Ideas for Innovation allows our consumers, customers, suppliers, contractors, inventors and friends to share ideas with us. Through this web portal, people submit ideas for consideration by our Research and Development and Marketing personnel, who are constantly looking to improve our products, packaging and production methods.
A Commitment to Innovation
In 2012, as part of an effort to further increase the rate of innovation across our baking and 
snacking portfolio, Campbell opened a new 34,000-square-foot innovation center at our Pepperidge Farm headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut.
This will not only strengthen our commitment to innovation but also give our exemplary innovators 
the necessary resources to execute that commitment.
FOCUS FORWARD
We plan to enhance significantly our investment in innovation capabilities to deliver even more great-tasting  
healthy options to our consumers, while tracking and reporting our innovation progress.
Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  3802 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS
Ensuring Consumer Satisfaction
Listening to our consumers and providing them with information they want and need
Campbell actively seeks and values consumer feedback, both the positive and the negative. Last 
year, nearly 400,000 consumers in the U.S. and Canada contacted Campbell to ask questions, express concerns or praise our products. A majority of these conversations occurred through our toll-free phone number, although some consumers also sent us letters and engaged with us through our websites and social media.
Our dedicated Consumer Affairs team is charged with receiving, tracking and responding to all consumer feedback. This 
includes continuously engaging with individuals who use social media outlets to comment on our products. Through an ongoing analysis of consumer comments, we are able to improve our products, packaging, production processes and level of service.
Tracking Consumer Feedback
In addition to unsolicited feedback from consumers, we also proactively conduct frequent surveys and other research to gauge consumer satisfaction and improve our understanding of our consumers’ expectations. We constantly challenge ourselves to find new and innovative ways to meet or exceed these expectations.
One of the best ways to find out whether our consumers are satisfied has been simply to ask them. Consumer satisfaction is the key 
to consumer loyalty and retention. Consumers participate in a short, post-call survey and provide us with useful information that is then used to create process and service improvements. Our consumers literally mean the world to our Consumer Affairs team.
Providing Information Our Consumers Want
Campbell continually develops and tests new programs to provide consumers with useful information on meal ideas, health and wellness, and other tips. For example, each day our Meal-Mail program delivers nearly 500,000 convenient, great-tasting meal ideas and recipes electronically to busy Americans.
On the Campbell Kitchen website, consumers can also download recipe ideas that have been tested and approved by our 
Campbell’s Kitchen team, often with the assistance of our Campbell chefs and nutritionists.
Nourishment extends beyond information and providing our consumers with choices. To that end, we actively engage 
consumers in programs designed to help them live better and longer lives. We understand, for example, that it can be a challenge to manage dietary needs for individuals who are allergic to certain foods.FISCAL YEAR 2012

Food Safety and Quality
Providing safe and wholesome products, earning the trust of our consumers and continuously 
improving our safety and quality systems
Over the course of generations, Campbell brands have earned the trust of our customers and 
consumers by delivering safe and wholesome products. We are committed to identifying and using the best available monitoring and prevention technologies. Our food safety and quality control systems meet the highest standards in the industry and we work continuously to improve those systems. Particularly at a time when public concern over the safety of the food supply is intensifying, we know that maintaining consumers’ long-standing confidence in our products is critical.
Trust is earned with each product we make, and we pride ourselves on our excellent quality standards and policies, outstanding 
process control capabilities and strong record of regulatory compliance. Our exacting requirements are applied not only to our facilities, but also to our contract manufacturers and suppliers globally.
The Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law in January 2011, is changing the landscape of food safety regulation and 
will require manufacturers and suppliers to hold themselves to the strictest standards of safety and quality. Campbell is in an excellent position to comply with the new law’s food safety requirements. We expect that the law will bolster our already strong supply chain management program.
Managing Food Safety
Campbell has a great heritage of leadership in food safety. Food safety requires the utmost attention and care to the growing, handling, preparation and storage of food so as to avoid any possibility of  food-borne illnesses. At Campbell, food safety involves a broad collection of departments and teams that work with one another and with external partners to manage risks and protect our consumers, our customers, our brands and our Company. Our first and foremost priority is to assure that our foods are safe and wholesome.
Working Together…
Campbell food safety professionals bring together a variety of scientific disciplines, such as microbiology, thermal processing, analytical chemistry and forensic analysis. Campbell experts actively support and lead the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) and other highly respected technical, trade and scientific organizations in the work of advancing food safety.
…Using Technology…
Campbell employs several layers of technology to keep our food products safe — from optical sorters to magnetic scanning and metal detectors to eliminate foreign objects. To make certain that what’s on the label is what’s in the package, Campbell helped develop a “vision” system to help ensure that the labels placed on every can or package are correct, can after can. Another emerging area is cutting-edge X-ray technology that not only can detect metal, glass and other dense foreign objects, but can also identify package or filling defects.Partnership with the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network
To increase awareness and provide additional education for families affected by food allergies, Campbell has partnered 
with the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) to offer a free six-month trial membership to any family dealing with allergies.
By helping consumers participate in FAAN, we seek to assist those with allergies to understand their dietary options 
and obtain the information they need to minimize health risks. For consumers who prefer gluten free products, we have created a website that contains important information on regulating such a diet, as well as a list of products that are gluten free.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  4002 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS
…and Committing to Continuous Improvement in Food Safety
We also understand that our products — and our reputation — are only as good as the ingredients that come from our suppliers. 
Campbell has developed a comprehensive program designed to assure the safety of ingredients and packaging materials throughout the supply chain, and involving collaboration with suppliers, packaging companies and co-manufacturers. Our suppliers’ quality controls must be as good as ours, and we work intensively with them to validate their processes and work with them on continual improvement.
Ingredient Sourcing and Traceability
We purchase our ingredients from carefully screened suppliers around the world, each of whom must comply with the strict requirements for safety and quality set forth in the Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual. These requirements were developed through many years of experience and knowledge and are based on best practices in the industry. We ensure that our requirements are met through comprehensive and careful auditing of suppliers’ systems and manufacturing locations. Additionally, we monitor our suppliers on an ongoing basis and conduct periodic audits of our suppliers as well as onsite inspections to ensure continuing compliance.
We require that our suppliers know where their ingredients come from, and have exacting control and monitoring programs 
in place to ensure that safety and quality standards are maintained. With hundreds of suppliers located around the world, we maintain oversight and visibility into the systems and practices of our suppliers.
Vendors must also meet stringent requirements, using preventative control systems such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control 
Points (HACCP), a systematic, preventive approach to controlling food hazards. We use HACCP in our own manufacturing facilities as well. Vendors and co-manufacturers are also subject to rigorous and regular audits by Campbell’s Global Procurement and Supply Base Quality teams to ensure continued compliance with our standards. We verify the safety of the ingredients and finished products using analytical tests, microbiological assays and investigations of packaging integrity — a holistic approach that makes Campbell a leader in food safety
Product Manufacturing
Campbell operates 30 manufacturing plants in 10 countries with the support of more than 1,600 individual suppliers and more than 70 co-packers. Our facilities produce more than five billion packages of 10,000 distinct soup, sauce, baked snack, bakery and beverage products.
Throughout the manufacturing process, our quality teams monitor, identify and address potential issues that could create a 
quality or safety risk. In collaboration with our suppliers, other food manufacturers and customers, Campbell has committed to the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). We require all of our manufacturing facilities to be certified to GFSI- recognized standards.
Allergens
We control for a variety of food allergens, including:
– Fin fish– Shellfish– Peanuts– Tree nuts– Eggs– Dairy protein (dairy in Australia)– Soy protein– Wheat– Sesame seeds
We maintain strict internal controls to safeguard against cross-contamination during production, including a data system to 
maintain label ingredient statement and claims accuracy. We have also pioneered the use of advanced coding and scanning technologies that help verify individual packages for labeling accuracy, allergen control and product traceability.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  4 102 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS
Incident Management
We maintain strict and consistent controls throughout our manufacturing processes and are prepared to act swiftly and 
effectively if there is ever a problem with any of our products. If we suspect that the safety of a Campbell product has been compromised, Campbell’s Corporate Crisis Management Team initiates a recall process to remove the product from store warehouses and shelves, and alerts consumers immediately. Working through protocols established by government agencies around the world, we can provide regular updates on the scope and status of any product recall. We also have 24-hour support available to our retail trade customers and consumers to address any questions and concerns.
Following any recall, we conduct a thorough root-cause analysis to identify and implement corrective actions. The 
implementation of such a rigorous process has led to improvements in our tracking and manufacturing controls, with only two recalls affecting three products in 2012.
Genetically Modified (GM) Ingredients
Campbell is keenly aware of ongoing concerns among consumers and regulators over genetically modified ingredients of food products in some of the markets where we sell products. For each of these markets, we employ rigorous practices to comply with local laws and regulations to guard against commingling of ingredients and maintain the integrity of our ingredient stream.
Australia
In Australia, we’re doing as much as is technically possible to ensure our products do not contain genetically modified organisms. Our policy is to use non-genetically engineered (GE) ingredients. We audit existing and new ingredient suppliers on an ongoing basis and have added a provision in their contracts stipulating our requirement for non-GE ingredients.
Europe
In Europe, we are committed to ensuring that our products always meet the preferences and demands of our consumers. As a result, we work to avoid the use of ingredients that are genetically modified or derived from genetically modified raw materials. That is why we currently only use ingredients from conventional sources across our portfolio of foods.
Advancing Social Impact with Consumers
Promoting healthy lifestyles, the prevention of chronic disease and access to healthy, nutritious 
and affordable food
At Campbell, we stand strong in our belief that supporting strategic partnerships will allow us  
to make a more powerful impact on the lives of our consumers. Although there are many societal needs that deserve addressing today, we know that we are uniquely positioned to make the biggest impact in making healthy and nutritious foods accessible and affordable, targeting the hunger crisis and childhood obesity in the U.S., bringing positive opportunities to youth, and promoting heart health among women. By keeping our efforts focused, we can measure our impacts much more accurately.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  4202 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS
Campbell’s Healthy Communities Program
We recognize that childhood obesity is a major health problem in the U.S. Campbell has long been focused on health in our 
workplace and healthy options in our product portfolio. In assessing the needs of our communities and our unique strengths as a company, we set a destination goal to help improve the health of young people in our communities by reducing childhood obesity and hunger by 50% by 2020.
In 2011, we formally launched this program in our longtime home of Camden, New Jersey, by committing $10 million, spread 
over 10 years, to support our goal. We also hired a Director - Healthy Communities to drive our efforts in Camden and in other North American Campbell communities.
Labels for Education
The Labels for Education (LFE) program, which provides educational supplies for the redemption of eligible product labels, has awarded more than $118 million in equipment and supplies to thousands of schools across the U.S. and Canada since its inception in 1973. The program is registered in more than 60,000 schools, with approximately 30,000 active participants.
In FY2012, the program continued its relationships with other manufacturers such as Pop Secret products, Post cereals, 
Emerald nuts, BIC stationery products, Glad food storage and Dannon kids yogurts, increasing the number of items eligible for distribution in the program from 1,500 to more than 2,500.
E-Labels for Education
The new e-labels initiative allows shoppers at supermarkets like Kroger, SuperValu, Safeway, Wakefern, Price Chopper and Giant Eagle to register their frequent shopper cards and designate a beneficiary school.
Each time they purchase an item from an eligible manufacturer, the labels automatically get banked to the chosen school’s 
account, making clipping labels easier than ever. This new process allows youth and families to tap into their extended networks to support local schools and increase the number of opportunities for deserving schools to receive educational equipment they need.
In the first full year of the program, 37,000 schools received e-labels from more than 259,000 registered shopper cards.
Stamp Out Hunger
For the past 20 years, Campbell has partnered with the National Association of Letter Carriers 
and Feeding America on Stamp Out Hunger, the nation’s largest single-day food drive. Residents from across the country are invited to leave bags of nonperishable food items outside their mailboxes, which are then collected by the nation’s 210,000 letter carriers and delivered to local food banks. In FY2012, the food drive generated 70.5 million pounds of food, bringing the total collected since the drive’s inception to 1.2 billion pounds.

Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative
The Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) was launched in 2006 by the Council of Better Business 
Bureaus and 10 (now 17) food manufacturers. The goal of the Initiative is to shift the mix of advertising primarily directed to children to encourage healthier dietary choices and healthy lifestyles. The Initiative uses nutrition standards to govern what products are advertised to children. Campbell is a charter participant in the CFBAI.
Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation
The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation is a national, multiyear effort designed to help reduce obesity, especially childhood obesity, by 2015. It focuses on three critical areas: the marketplace, the workplace and schools. Campbell is a founding member of the group, which includes more than 160 members, including retailers, food and beverage manufacturers, restaurants and other organizations.
Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  4302 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS
Together Counts
Together Counts is a nationwide program created by the Healthy Weight Commitment 
Foundation to inspire active and healthy living. The principle behind the program is energy balance, which means balancing the calories people consume with the calories they burn. Families can log onto the Together Counts website and “Take the Pledge” to schedule at least two meals and two activities together every week. Campbell and Pepperidge Farm further promote the Together Counts program through our Facebook page and website.
National Salt Reduction Initiative
As a leader in sodium reduction, Campbell supports the National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI), an effort coordinated by the New York City Department of Health to encourage Americans to reduce their salt intake by 20% by 2015. Campbell has committed its SpaghettiOs pastas to the program; Pepperidge Farm breads and rolls, among certain other Campbell products, already meet NSRI 2012 targets.
Child Obesity 180
Denise Morrison, Campbell Soup Company President and CEO, is a member of Child Obesity 180 (CO180). CO180 brings together a wide range of stakeholders from all sectors to provide a politically neutral point of engagement, create connections among leaders and organizations, and utilize the best available evidence to power up a portfolio of key initiatives to deliver accelerated, amplified impact to improve the health of the nation’s children. Key components of the CO180 approach include multisector collaboration, capacity building, large-scale initiatives and process and outcome measures.
Facts Up Front Nutrition Labeling Initiative
Facts Up Front brings important information from the Nutrition Facts Panel, in a simple and easy-to-use format, to the 
front of food and beverage packages
Campbell helped lead this voluntary initiative aligned with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines and regulations.
Through Facts Up Front, participating food and beverage companies place icons on the front of their 
products that display calories, saturated fat, sodium and sugar per serving. Facts Up Front icons have been placed on more than 275 Campbell products since 2011 and will continue to be expanded to additional products. A similar initiative is also underway in Australia for front of pack labeling for energy, total fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium.

Overview
Honoring our long-standing commitment to the communities where we live and work
At Campbell, we are committed to making a measurable difference in the communities in 
which we live and work. We describe our community initiatives, quite aptly, as Nourishing Our Neighbors. Our efforts focus on areas in which we are uniquely capable of making the biggest impact by leveraging our core competencies to drive meaningful change.
Destination Goals
Our 2020 destination goals are instrumental in informing our work in the community:
– 
 Measur
ably improve the health of young people in our hometown communities by reducing hunger and childhood obesity  
by 50%.
– 
 Mak
e a positive impact on the lives of 100 million youth through our volunteer, community and signature programs.
Primary Focus
Core competencies: As a food company, Campbell is uniquely positioned to target hunger relief and childhood obesity. By 
focusing on our core competencies, we can institute change both through community programming and our brands. Each year, we partner with the National Association of Letter Carriers on Stamp Out Hunger, the largest single-day food drive in the U.S., collecting more than 70 million pounds of food in one day from generous Americans across the country.
Focused diligence: We know we don’t have all the answers. Like with any other community strategy, finding all the right 
partners and the right approach takes time. By setting our destination goal and starting in Camden, New Jersey, where Campbell is headquartered, we are learning what it will really take to reduce hunger and childhood obesity by 50% in 10 years. By focusing on one community, we are efficiently building the foundation of a program that can be adapted to other Campbell communities in the future with the potential of impacting thousands of youth across the country.
Innovation: We realize that writing regular checks and providing willing volunteers is not enough to answer our planet’s most 
pressing societal needs. We must develop innovative solutions. Campbell employees developed Just Peachy, a shelf-stable peach salsa which utilizes excess peaches which are nutritionally sound, but not suitable for sale. The salsa saves one local farmers cooperative some of its $80,000 in annual dumping fees and creates a sustainable revenue stream for the Food Bank of South Jersey. One hundred percent of the proceeds generated from the sale of Just Peachy support the food bank and its nine hunger relief programs.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  4603 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS
Supporting Volunteerism
Providing enthusiastic and passionate employee volunteers to local nonprofit organizations to 
make positive changes in our hometown communities
We consider our collaboration with nonprofit agencies as true partnerships that go beyond 
grants and in-kind support.
Each year, enthusiastic and dedicated employees across the globe provide more than 22,000 
hours of volunteer service to those in need in their local communities. From starting a food pantry to collecting gifts for the holidays, the impact of Campbell volunteers is felt across all regions where Campbell has operations.
The Role of Employee Engagement
Team volunteer events are a great way to engage our employees across departments. While these events happen year-round, 
more than 2,600 employees across the country make a special effort to participate in Make a Difference Week, Campbell’s annual week of volunteer service.
In FY2012, Campbell employees worked with more than 25 agencies, donating nearly 4,000 service hours at 90 events across 
various Campbell and Pepperidge Farm communities. National Make a Difference Day, which Campbell has participated in for the past 22 years, grew to Make a Difference Week in 2007, because Campbell employees were looking for more turnkey opportunities to volunteer during the workday.
Participation in the week has doubled each year since its expansion.
In FY2012, employees, including Campbell CEO Denise Morrison and her leadership team, served lunch and led physical activity programming for more than 160 Camden youth, gleaned 5,000 pounds of apples for donation at local farms and resurfaced a youth baseball field among other projects primarily focused on building healthy communities.
In Norwalk, Connecticut, more than 250 Pepperidge Farm employees spent a day renovating the new warehouse space of 
Christian Community Action, Norwalk’s largest food pantry. Employees painted the interior and exterior of the warehouse, 
cleaned, stocked newly constructed shelves with food and built bench seating.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  4 703 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS
Dollars for Doers
Encouraging employee volunteerism and recognizing volunteer service
Campbell employees are encouraged to volunteer during the workday, as well as on their own 
time. Our Dollars for Doers program recognizes and further supports these efforts by providing grant funding to community nonprofits, based on the service hours of employees. These hours are tracked in our Nourishing Our Neighbors portal, an online tool that captures volunteer hours, service projects, community events and more.
In FY2012, Campbell employees throughout the U.S. and Canada volunteered more than 22,300 hours at more than 312 
organizations. According to values put forth by the Independent Sector, a leadership forum for charities, foundations and corporate giving programs committed to advancing the common good, the estimated worth of Campbell employees’ service time in FY2012 was more than $480,000.
Employee volunteerism is supported financially through the Dollars for Doers program. For every 25 hours volunteered, eligible 
nonprofit organizations receive a $500 grant. In FY2012, 209 Dollars for Doers grants were distributed totaling $247,000 in support of individual and team volunteer efforts of employees and retirees across 18 locations in the U.S.
Volunteering with Strategic Focus
Focusing on making the biggest possible measurable impact in our designated goal areas
We recognize that to make long-lasting, sustainable change in areas such as hunger relief, 
childhood obesity and positive impacts to youth, financial support alone will not suffice. To complement our financial support, Campbell volunteers consistently utilize their passion, skills and talents to leverage Campbell’s core competencies as a food company to drive impactful change with key community partners.
Norwalk: Kids Summer Backpack Program
In the summer of 2012, employees at Pepperidge Farm headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut, continued the city’s first-ever 
Kids Summer Backpack Program in collaboration with United Way and the Connecticut Food Bank. Throughout this initiative, 177 children who qualify for free and reduced-cost meals during the school year received backpacks full of food each week during the summer months. More than 2,000 backpacks have been distributed to date in the second year of this three-year program.
Everett: Meals for Seniors
Our employees work together to combat hunger in their local communities. In Everett, Washington, a group of plant employees delivered meals twice a week to needy seniors in their local community through Meals on Wheels with Senior Services of Snohomish County.
Camden: Salvaging Fresh Produce
At our World Headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, employees visit local farms to glean fresh produce, not perfect for sale, but ripe for donation. In an average visit to a farm, employees salvage approximately 5,000 pounds of desirable produce such as apples, sweet potatoes, collard greens and more.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  4803 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS
Campbell’s Commitment: Feeding America
In most areas where Campbell has a facility, there is a steady volunteer partnership with the local Feeding America food 
bank. Employees assist with projects ranging from sorting food and packing kids packs and senior boxes, to building storage capability and assisting with capacity building through board service.
Campbell’s South Plainfield, New Jersey, spice plant closed its facility for an entire day so employees could participate in an 
event at the Community Food Bank of New Jersey. In FY2012, nearly 5,000 hours were volunteered for Feeding America food banks and their member agencies.
Impacting Local Youth
The Hispanic Network de Campbell created the Volunteers Engaging Neighbors program with St. Anthony of Padua School in Camden, New Jersey, designed to help Spanish-speaking families and children adjust to the American school system through tutoring, English as a second language classes, and financial literacy education. In Napoleon, Ohio, volunteers help local schoolchildren with reading skills as part of a mentoring program. In Everett, Washington, employees volunteer with the local Boys & Girls Club in organizing recreational activity for the youth.
Campbell People: Deb Garwood’s Story
For Deb Garwood, volunteering for the Ronald McDonald House of Southern New Jersey means more than just 
contributing to a cause she believes in.
Deb’s relationship with the Ronald McDonald House began in 2004 in 
Wilmington, Delaware, where the organization provided a “home away from home” for Deb’s family during her son’s cancer treatment. Upon returning to work later that year, Deb reached out to the Ronald McDonald House with a determination to give back to the organization and help other families facing the same issues she did. When Deb’s team in Consumer Affairs heard her heartfelt story, they decided to make her initiative a group effort and expressed an eagerness to participate.
Ever since, Deb has personally volunteered and led the Campbell team in a 
variety of activities such as preparing meals to adopting families over the holidays. “In addition to benefiting the community and families in need, it also gives our team the opportunity to learn more about each other,” she says.
Her most rewarding Ronald McDonald House volunteering experience was the House’s annual fundraiser, the Plane Pull, an 
event in which teams of volunteers are charged with moving a Boeing 737 in the shortest time. The event symbolized the different pieces of her life — her coworkers, family and friends — pulling together to reach a common goal. Through the efforts of Deb and her colleagues, the Ronald McDonald House received $6,000 in Dollars for Doers grants based on their service time in FY2012.
Deb associates strongly with Campbell’s commitment to the community and corporate social responsibility. “It’s a 
beautiful thing when your personal mission and your employer’s goals can fit together,” she says.
FOCUS FORWARD
Extend community programming at World Headquarters in Camden to global locations. We have seen great success 
with community initiatives in Camden. The next step will be to tailor and extend them to our global locations to make them more automated and sustainable.

Arnott’s Foundation
The employee-funded Arnott’s Foundation was founded in 2004 with the distinct focus on creating positive environments that allow Australian families to build, maintain and enjoy a better quality of life. The main beneficiary of the Arnott’s Foundation is Camp Quality, which works to support the families of children diagnosed with cancer each year.
In FY2012, the Arnott’s Foundation provided AU $237,000 to Camp Quality, which funded the Family Camp Program benefitting 
700 Australian families.
Employee Giving
Campbell employees financially support the work of nonprofits in their local community through their annual United Way employee giving campaign. Campbell is the largest giver to the United Way in many of the communities where we operate. In FY2012, 16 Campbell and Pepperidge Farm locations hosted giving campaigns, with employees’ contributions totaling $1.17 million. Coupled with a match from the Campbell Soup Foundation, United Way organizations across the country received a total of $1.76 million for the purpose of bringing vital social services to the residents of our local communities.

initiatives, totaling more than $200,000 in donations in FY2012 to organizations such as the American Cancer Society, Feeding America, Prostate Cancer Foundation and more.
NRTC
Neighborhood Revitalization Tax Credit Program (NRTC)
Beyond investing in social service agencies, Campbell works with community development centers in Camden on citywide revitalization efforts. Through the Neighborhood Revitalization Tax Credit Program, Campbell has funded neighborhood plans in Camden, New Jersey, since 2008. In FY2012, Campbell provided $700,000 in support of two neighborhood plans in the city:

Achieving Lasting Social Impact
Making a measurable impact in the areas of hunger relief, childhood obesity and positive impacts 
to youth
At Campbell, we know that in order to make a lasting impact toward hunger relief and childhood 
obesity, we need to embrace our core competencies, execute with focused diligence and take an innovative approach to finding real world solutions.
Product Donations
We know we cannot solve the hunger issue on our own. Therefore, we work closely with national organizations such as 
Feeding America. In FY2012, Campbell donated more than $32 million worth of product in support of the efforts of 25,000 charitable organizations throughout the U.S. Support was primarily of Feeding America food banks and their member agencies. Additionally, more product was distributed through ongoing product reclamation efforts.
Campbell Arnott’s contributed $1.8 million worth of product to Foodbank Australia in 2012, totaling approximately 1.7 million 
units of biscuits, soup, stock and juice.  In addition, Campbell Japan contributed JPY $4.8 million worth of product to Second Harvest Japan.
Just Peachy
In FY2012, the Food Bank of South Jersey, a Feeding America food bank, was struggling to meet the increased demand 
for their services from more than 171,000 food insecure residents in Southern NJ. Meanwhile, Eastern Pro Pak Farmers Cooperative was dumping 800,000 pounds of nutritionally sound, but undersized and slightly blemished peaches annually, at a cost of $80,000. From that, a peach of an idea, Just Peachy salsa, was born.
A team of Campbell employees developed the recipe and donated the manufacturing expertise and facility, Eastern Pro 
Pak provided the peaches and ten Campbell suppliers donated packaging and ingredients. The result was 42,000 jars of Just Peachy salsa which were sold in 25 retail outlets across Southern NJ, creating a sustainable revenue stream for the food bank. One hundred percent of the proceeds generated supported the Food Bank of South Jersey and its nine hunger relief programs.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  5 303 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS
Campbell and Food Banks Canada continued their comprehensive multiyear partnership to support hunger relief across Canada 
through the donation of one million pounds of nutritious food, charitable funds, educational resources and capacity-building programs. Through FY2012, more than 350,000 cans of 
Nourish, a nutrient-dense, “meal in a can,” developed by Campbell 
Canada employees for direct donation , have been donated throughout Canada, the Canadian North and internationally to Haitian 
refugees living in the Dominican Republic. In addition, a purchase program through Food Banks Canada, the nation’s largest food collection and distribution agency, allows Canadian food banks to purchase the product at a minimal charitable rate.
In total in FY2012, Campbell donated more than $32 million worth of product to organizations 
that distributed it to those in need across the globe.
Stamp Out Hunger
For the past 20 years, Campbell has partnered with the National Association of Letter Carriers and Feeding America on Stamp Out Hunger, the nation’s largest single-day food drive. Residents from across the country are invited to leave bags of nonperishable food items outside their mailboxes, which are then collected by the nation’s 210,000 letter carriers and delivered to local food banks. Campbell works to promote household awareness through the distribution of direct mail postcards, donation bags and an exhaustive social media and public relations campaign. Campbell also kicks off the drive each yearby donating one million pounds of food to the effort.
In FY2012, the food drive generated 70.5 million pounds of food, bringing the total collected since the drive’s inception to 1.2 
billion pounds. This also marked the ninth consecutive year donation totals have topped 70 million pounds.
Fill the Food Banks
In FY2012, Campbell Canada partnered for a second year with Shaw Communications’ Fill the Food Banks national campaign. The goal of the program was to raise hunger awareness, donate food and raise funds for registered food banks before the start of the winter season to meet the needs of the nearly 900,000 Canadians that go to bed hungry each night. Consumers were asked to participate in fundraising events and get involved online, where Campbell Canada matched You Tube views with donations as part of their one million pound annual commitment to Food Banks Canada. Results included CDN $635,000 in funds and 1.25 million pounds of food collected in addition to hunger awareness generated through 300,000 YouTube views

Help Hunger Disappear
Now in its fifth year, Campbell Canada’s Help Hunger Disappear program encourages Canadians to get involved and 
make donations to their local food banks. This annual spring hunger campaign is timed with National Hunger Awareness Day to drive contributions when they are needed most.
In partnership with key retail partners, the program has evolved to include 
an in-store display of the word HUNGER built out of Campbell’s soup cans from which shoppers are encouraged to remove a can until HUNGER disappears. In addition, more than CDN $100,000 in cash contributions and CDN $78,000 in food donations were contributed by participating shoppers throughout the campaign. Campbell contributed CDN $75,000 to the effort.

Let’s Can Hunger
Campbell is a strategic partner with Enactus (formerly Students in Free Enterprise), a nonprofit organization that unites a global 
community of student, academic and business leaders committed to using the power of entrepreneurial action to transform lives and enable real human progress. In FY2012, collegiate members of SIFE teamed with Campbell for a fourth year on an initiative called Let’s Can Hunger, a series of competitions in which participating teams developed creative solutions for urgent and lasting 
hunger relief and building awareness about the hunger issue.
In the 2011-2012 academic year, the challenge included participation from 173 teams spanning three countries.These teams exceeded the cumulative goal of collecting 750,000 pounds of food by more than doubling it in FY2012 and 
benefiting 355 food banks and pantries. The overall winner for the U.S., Northwest Arkansas Community College in Bentonville, AR, coordinated with the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank and other organizations to create a cohesive hunger awareness media campaign, executed 14 food drive events with more than 85,000 pounds of food collected and hosted a series of Cooking Matters  
classes for children and senior citizens to provide nutrition, cooking and budgeting information.
Since the program’s inception, more than 361 million people have been affected by hunger awareness outreach as a result of the 
effort of more than 9,600 students around the world.
Campbell Better Meals Community Kitchen Fund
In 2009, Campbell Canada launched the Campbell Better Meals Community Kitchen Fund program to support local food banks across Canada in the development or expansion of a Community Kitchen. The program helps provide food bank clients with the nutrition education and cooking resources they need to make better meals. Over the years, the Campbell Better Meals Community Kitchen Fund provided grants to food banks across Canada.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  5503 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS
Healthy Communities
Focusing on our commitment to reducing childhood obesity and hunger through our signature 
strategic initiative
We recognize that childhood obesity is a major health problem in the U.S. Today, more than 30% 
of our children are overweight or obese, which can lead to future health problems and associated medical and societal costs. Since its inception, Campbell has focused on health in our workplace and healthy options in our product portfolio.
Campbell Healthy Camden
In assessing the needs of our communities and our unique strengths as a company, we set a destination goal to help improve 
the health of young people in our communities by reducing childhood obesity and hunger by 50% by 2020.
In 2011, we formally launched our Campbell Healthy Communities program in our home of Camden, New Jersey. We announced 
a commitment of $10 million over 10 years in support of our goal and hired a Director of Healthy Communities to drive our efforts in Camden and other North American Campbell communities.
Our initial efforts are focused at five pilot sites in Camden, a city of 78,000 residents, 23,000 children, one full-size grocery 
store, 160 bodegas and significantly higher levels of childhood obesity and hunger than the national average.
Our strategy focuses on four areas:
1. Access to nutritious and fresh foods;2. Access to safe places to play, exercise and walk;3. Nutrition education — prenatal to adult; and4. Building public will within the community to advance real solutions.
As a food company with a healthy portfolio of products, we are uniquely positioned to participate in the creation of an 
accessible and equitable food system in our community. We are doing this by constantly leveraging our expertise, integrating nutrition education throughout our program strategies and engaging the community within all aspects of our work.
Despite our expertise and resources, overall success will require a collective impact approach. We have assembled a group of 
representatives from different sectors that express a long-term commitment to our common agenda for solving the obesity and hunger issues facing our community, including:
– The Y of Burlington and Camden Counties- Food Bank of South Jersey- Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers- The Food Trust- Camden Children’s Garden- Greensgrow Farms- Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission- The Reinvestment Fund- Center for Hunger Free Communities- US Soccer Foundation
Our goal is to serve as a catalyst by identifying opportunities for long-term systemic change in Camden by inviting participation 
from other institutional donors, as well as ownership by community partners, throughout the city.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  5603 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS
Some of the current elements of this program include:
- Promoting the introduction and uptake of healthy food choices in 25 corner stores throughout Camden;- Providing child, family and adult cooking classes to teach menu planning, smart shopping, basic cooking skills and food safety;- Implementing the Coordinated Approach to Child Health (“C.A.T.C.H.”)  “train the trainer” model to institute 30 minutes of 
daily physical activity four days a week during the school day;
- Implementing the Pregnancy, Parenting Partners program to promote prenatal/well child visits focused on nutrition education;- Promoting organized urban gardening on vacant, city-owned lots to increase access to healthy produce; and- Expanding availability of seasonal produce at reasonable prices produced by local farmers, while accepting WIC, SNAP and 
senior coupons via mobile markets.
While the program has just completed its first year, the collective work is having impacts across Camden. Highlights from the 
first year include:
- Provided 6.5 million minutes of physical activity to 1,400 Camden youth;- Decreased number of injuries and behavior incidents in participating schools;- Created 28 new sites for healthy food access in Camden;- Provided more than 12,700 residents access to healthy, affordable foods in their neighborhoods;- Serviced 850 Camden residents through mobile farmer’s markets;- Provided 25,260 minutes of nutrition education to children in Camden;- Provided cooking classes to 391 children and their families where 73% of participants continue to put their new knowledge into 
practice at home; and
- Leveraged an additional $1 million in funds invested into Camden as a result of the Healthy Communities program and its 
partners.
In 2013, we expect to continue to advance the program in Camden, while building modules transferable to other Campbell 
communities. We also plan to have baseline BMI and food security outcome measures complete for Camden in 2013.
Campbell Healthy Norwalk (Project L.E.A.N.)
In Norwalk, Connecticut, hometown of Pepperidge Farm, childhood obesity approximates 40%, which exceeds the national rate of 30%, and yet, until recently, no program to address this crisis existed. Pepperidge Farm invited a diverse group of community stakeholders to join us in developing a new approach to this challenge. These stakeholders, including Pepperidge Farm, the Norwalk Hospital, the Norwalk Health Department and Jefferson Elementary School, formed an alliance that was a first for the city.
Each partner brought a unique set of skills and resources that resulted in very effective and productive team approach to 
attacking this critical social issue.  In a matter of four months, the team designed and implemented the Learning with Energy from Activity and Nutrition (L.E.A.N.) project.
Project L.E.A.N. is a three-year pilot program designed to teach a targeted group of elementary students at Jefferson School 
the importance of good nutrition and regular physical activity. The program is designed for second graders who will be tracked for three consecutive years.
Some of the current elements of this program include:
– 
 Clas
sroom education and exercise led by a dietician from Norwalk Hospital to promote good nutrition, healthy eating 
behaviors and physical activity;
– 
 A bef
ore-school “Breakfast Boot Camp” to provide students with 45 minutes of guided physical activity followed by a healthy 
breakfast; and
– 
 P
arent engagement sessions, which are scheduled throughout the school year, to drive parent engagement and investment in 
Project L.E.A.N.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  5 703 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS
In order to measure the success of the program, pre- and- post data is collected at the beginning and end of the school year, 
including BMI measures. Specifically, participating students are asked to complete a pre- and- post questionnaire designed to assess their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors toward healthy eating and being physically active.
Two years into the program, the results are very encouraging. There has been consistent improvement in the test students’ 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviors toward eating healthy foods and being active. Parental feedback continues to be extremely supportive, absentee rate for the class is down and BMI results reveal an increase in the percentage of students with a “healthy” BMI.
 
Positive Impacts to Youth
Increasing the availability and success of positive activities for local youth
Integral to Campbell’s goal of impacting the lives of 100 million youth over 10 years is a breadth 
of programming aimed at improving education, health and well-being. This programming is managed by the Campbell Soup Foundation and includes consumer initiatives and beyond.
Summer Program
In 1975, the Campbell Soup Foundation created the Summer Program, an initiative to support safe, constructive summertime 
activities for underserved Camden youth. The Foundation has distributed more than $17 million in grants over 38 years to  nonprofit organizations that offer summer activities in the areas of arts and culture, education, career exploration and recreation, servicing approximately 543,000 youth since the Summer Program’s inception. The Foundation annually contributes approximately $385,000 to 18 organizations during the Summer Program.
Team Extreme
Pepperidge Farm continues to partner with the NBA and star players such as Dwayne Wade, Tony Parker and Al Horford to engage youth across the country in fun, active play. To participate, youth simply have to join Team Extreme online, play outside and log their hours for a chance to win great prizes. The Team Extreme Website Play Center is the hub where kids can go to learn about a variety of active games to play outside.
Team Extreme currently has more than 88,000 active members who have logged and tracked 537,000 hours of playtime in 
FY2012.
Labels for Education
The Labels for Education program, which provides educational supplies for the redemption of eligible product labels, has awarded more than $118 million in equipment and supplies to thousands of schools across the U.S. and Canada since its inception in 1973. The program is registered in more than 60,000 schools, with approximately 30,000 active participants.
In FY2012, the program continued its relationships with other manufacturers such as Pop Secret products, Post cereals, 
Emerald nuts, BIC stationery products, Glad food storage and Dannon kids yogurts, increasing the number of items eligible for distribution in the program from 1,500 to more than 2,500.FOCUS FORWARD
Broaden our Campbell’s Healthy Camden Program to focus on a citywide food system, while also becoming a key 
player and convener of city and state officials, nonprofit organizations and others advocating for a food system plan  to make nutritious, high-quality food accessible to everyone in Camden.

E-Labels for Education
The new e-labels initiative allows shoppers at supermarkets like Kroger, 
SuperValu, Safeway, Wakefern, Price Chopper and Giant Eagle to register their frequent shopper cards and designate a beneficiary school.
Each time they purchase an item from an eligible manufacturer, the labels automatically get banked to the chosen school’s 
account, making clipping labels easier than ever. This new process allows youth and families to tap into their extended networks to support local schools and increase the number of opportunities for deserving schools to receive educational equipment they need.
In FY2012, 37,000 schools received e-labels from more than 259,000 registered shopper cards.

04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEESOur Commitment to the Campbell Culture
Campbell’s commitment to nourishing the culture of our Company is embodied in The Way We Work, which focuses on our 
desire to build a safe, diverse, inclusive, engaged and socially responsible workplace that delivers business results with integrity. We want The Way We Work to be more than a slogan for our employees. To start off, each employee must set at least one individual objective that furthers our collective efforts to build and maintain such a workplace during the annual Performance Management process.
The Way We Work
Building a safe, diverse, inclusive, engaged and socially responsible workplace that delivers 
business results with integrity
While we are continually looking for ways to leverage 
Campbell’s world-class engagement to drive sustainable business results, we believe employees feel most valued when they are:
– Recognized and celebrated for their contributions– 
 W
ell-informed and aligned with how their work connects 
to the Company’s overall goals and plans
– Encouraged to bring their uniqueness to work each day– 
 Engaged in an ongoing dialogue tha
t encourages the 
sharing and challenging of ideas
Celebrating, Informing & Engaging Employees
Employees want to know that what they do matters — that their work 
adds value and furthers our Company’s mission. Here’s a sampling of our programs in place, all designed to ensure Campbell employees are engaged 
and celebrated.
Recognition for Driving Business Performance
Campbell prides itself on celebrating employees throughout the year 
in many formal and informal ways. Our premier recognition event is the Extraordinary Performance Awards (EPA). During this annual ceremony, individual employees and teams are recognized for results that directly support our business strategies, Leadership Model and Values. The highlight of the ceremony is always the presentation of the Dr. John T. Dorrance Award , which recognizes outstanding business results and breakthrough 
thinking. This award, established in 1994, is bestowed upon a business team and honors exemplary performance in the marketplace. This award is the highest honor at Campbell’s annual Extraordinary Performance Awards.
Though the signature event is held in Camden, New Jersey, employees 
come from all parts of the world to be recognized and to congratulate their colleagues.

04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEESMany business units and functions, such as our sales company and Asia 
Pacific region, hold similar events. To incorporate local “flavor,” Asia Pacific includes a unique Leading with Integrity Award that honors Campbell Arnott’s leaders who consistently exemplify integrity, character, competence and teamwork.
Celebrating the Contributions of Others
An online recognition program allows employees to thank one another for making a difference. Make a Difference (MAD) award recipients receive a gift card and a certificate to display in their work areas. In 2012, over 2,541 MAD awards were granted.
Competition to Spur Innovation
The annual Pepperidge Farm Innovation Fair is an opportunity for employees to submit their best and brightest ideas for new products. Based around a belief that great ideas can come from anywhere, employees from all areas of the company are encouraged to develop concepts that have the potential to be commercialized and continue to drive business growth. Generous cash prizes are awarded to winning ideas, especially those that make it to market, such as the tasty seasonal Pepperidge Farm Pumpkin Swirl bread.
At the most recent fair, employees were challenged to come up with new concepts for the snack category. Entries flooded in 
from around the world, including ideas from teams in Australia and Malaysia. Hundreds of people attend the Fair to view the fantastic ideas, taste samples and vote for their favorite.
Meaningful and Timely Company News
Campbell recognizes that constant communication is critical to employee engagement and empowerment. We make it a point to connect employees at all levels of the organization to what’s going on inside and outside the Company. From business results to employee volunteer efforts and events, Campbell employees receive meaningful information through a variety of vehicles, including our online publication — Campbell Today — and quarterly Employee Forums that give employees the opportunity to hear directly from our CEO and other senior leaders about company strategies and financial performance. At the local level, employees rely on updates from their managers during team meetings and shift huddles. This cascade of information helps ensure employees know what’s happening, how it impacts them, what they need to do and how their work fits into the larger picture.

04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEESExtraordinary Workplace
Creating a workplace that nourishes employees’ unique goals and aspirations for their health, 
finances, life and career
Campbell strives to create a workplace that treats people with respect, gives them the tools and 
resources to progress in their careers, provides competitive compensation, and offers access to benefits and programs that help them maintain and enhance their overall health — physically, mentally and financially. We recognize that it’s all connected. And we know that in order to help employees be at their best, we need to deliver employee-centric programs that are meaningful and support them in achieving their own unique goals. 
We take a holistic approach to wellness that encompasses physical health, 
mental well-being and financial security now and in the future.
Your Health
We strive to make it easy for employees to nourish their health by providing integrated and targeted initiatives. For example, employees can visit our on-site Health Station Tour for a biometric screening and receive on-the-spot health coaching. Employees can then use that to complete our Online Health Assessment, which also connects them to relevant resources to help manage their unique health risks and take advantage of relevant Campbell health and wellness programs. This is an initiative by our voluntary Medical Decision Support™ program, which provides free, independent and expert advice on a broad array of medical topics. 
Your Finances
Our 401(k) plan allows U.S. employees to save for retirement through automatic payroll contributions, while earning a Company match.
Competitive Compensation
Campbell offers competitive pay that is market-based and performance-driven. As 
 part of our annual P
erformance Management process, employees 
are evaluated and rewarded both on what they do (the results they create) and how  they do it (demonstration of Campbell’s leadership model 
behaviors).
Your Future
We encourage employees to continually focus on health and financial goals. We promote available resources throughout the year, utilizing our benefits newsletter, online resources and digital signage displayed throughout the workplace. Most recently, we piloted a well-received Financial Education Workshop series aimed at helping U.S. employees understand their personal finances and how to better prepare for retirement. Ninety-three percent of program participants agreed that the workshop increased their financial planning knowledge.
Your Life
To assist employees with balancing their work and personal commitments, Campbell offers a number of resources, along with Flexible Work Arrangements. For example, Your Life Resources provides 24-hour support and counseling for U.S. employees looking for help with things such as parenting, legal issues and self-improvement. Stress management resources also are provided through multiple channels, including Your Life Resources, online coaching modules and Medical Decision Support™ personalized kits mailed to employees’ homes.

04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEESA Culture of Health
We believe that employee involvement in our health and wellness programs is driven by the inherent value and relevance of 
the programs. We work to promote personal wellness and create a culture of health built on a foundation of education, strong benefits design, leadership support at all levels (from the C-suite to line management) and employee involvement on an individual and group basis.
We use a variety of incentives and recognition, along with the competitiveness of our sites, to help engage employees in healthy 
behaviors. Some examples include:
Identifying Health Risks
We provide numerous opportunities for employees to earn gift cards by taking active roles in their preventive healthcare, e.g., completing a Health Assessment, taking action based on those results and having the highest site participation rate.
Making Informed Decisions
Access to independent, expert, personalized and confidential information is available through Consumers Medical Resources via our Medical Decision Support™ (MDS™) program. Employees can also earn a $200 gift card for taking the time to get informed prior to making treatment decisions for some elective surgeries.
Recognizing and Celebrating Health Success
Our Healthy Lifestyle award recognizes employees for practicing healthy behaviors and positively influencing others. Overall winners receive a cash prize, a gift basket of healthy Campbell products, and recognition at a quarterly Employee Forum.
Talent Management & Development
Campbell believes that employees are more engaged and perform better when they know how their work relates to the bigger picture and understand what resources are available to help them develop.
This year, Campbell launched a new global talent management system. This online system allows employees to enter personal 
objectives, view feedback and insights from their manager, and create and track an individual development plan based on their own unique career aspirations and skills. The system also provides leaders with real-time data that helps inform key talent decisions around compensation, succession, global mobility and development investments.Flexibility at Work
Rebecca Bagin, Vice President of Human Resources, doesn’t just help 
administer our Flexibility policy. As an employee, she was able to take advantage of a compressed work week to pursue a master’s degree in Organization Dynamics at the University of Pennsylvania, a personal  goal that we are proud to have helped her reach.

04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEESBuilding a Learning Organization
We recognize that development is a long-term commitment with great 
rewards and, therefore, develop our talent through diverse experiences, feedback, coaching, and learning programs.
To do this, we organize our development efforts around four areas:
All Employees
Offerings focused on increasing personal effectiveness skills are available to all employees. Courses include presentation skill-building and how to effectively create an individual development plan.
Managers
Offerings designed to enhance manager quality are available, with topics including change management, managing performance and coaching.
Leadership
Offerings focused on enhancing company leadership capability are available to select leadership groups with courses like STARS, which provides a logical, consistent, iterative process for analyzing and addressing significant problems and opportunities.
Functional
These offerings are designed to increase employees’ knowledge and skills within a specialized function, such as marketing or finance.
Enhancing Manager Quality
Managers play a pivotal role in employee engagement and overall performance and are in a position to “make or break” the employee’s relationship with Campbell each and every day. Campbell believes it is essential that they have the skills and resources necessary to do their  jobs well.
To that end, over the last several years, Campbell has focused on building 
manager capability in key areas, including selecting talent, coaching and managing performance. This helps create a common language throughout the organization, and also ensures a common employee experience no matter where someone is located.
Our newest offering — The Campbell Way for Managing new manager program — is a mix of classroom and virtual learning. 
This six-month course is designed to clarify the expectations of a Campbell manager, allow new managers to practice effective people management skills, and create a “network” of new managers who can help each other after the program ends
.Campbell University offers our diverse global workforce the ability to learn and grow in a variety of ways, including:
– Classroom-based courses– Webinars– Podcasts– Self-paced e-learning options
In 2012, Campbell provided $1.2 million 
worldwide in tuition assistance to help eligible employees complete courses at accredited schools.
FOCUS FORWARD
Our focus on Manager Quality helps ensure managers not only complete training but are also putting those new skills, 
processes and approaches to work within their teams. Doing so builds engagement, productivity and a better overall working environment.

04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEESDiversity & Inclusion
Striving to create an inclusive environment, rich in diverse people, talent and ideas to fuel our 
growth and create a high performance culture driven by engaged employees
We define diversity as “the similarities and unique differences of individuals in the workplace, 
marketplace and community” and inclusion as “an extraordinary place to be, where every voice is heard, you can be who you aspire to be and our differences make a difference.”
We understand that establishing an inclusive global culture is critical to the sustainability and success of our business and to 
win in a rapidly evolving global marketplace, we must cultivate and embrace a diverse employee population.
Our culture is represented by our commitment to The Way We Work. This guiding principal helps ensure that we are an 
employer and business partner of choice for our customers, consumers, communities and shareowners. Our community of diverse cultures, ideas and voices attracts a talented and engaged workforce, sustains alignment and affinity with consumers, and fosters innovative solutions.
Strategic Focus
Our Diversity & Inclusion strategy supports our intention to integrate what we know about changing global demographics into all aspects of managing our business.
Today, women make up 45% of Campbell’s workforce and people of color 
make up 35%. While employee representation (including retention and development), is a critical area of focus within our strategy, we believe that the culture of our organization is a key driver in creating and reinforcing a dynamically diverse and inclusive environment.
Campbell’s efforts are driven by a robust communications and engagement 
strategy and further enhanced by partnership, counsel and consultancy across our business.
Business Resource Affinity Networks (BRANs)
Our BRANs - or Business Resources Affinity Networks - are another powerful driver of our efforts. These organizations are employee-led, company supported volunteer organizations, which help us focus outward and connect to an increasingly diverse consumer base. They also help us focus inward by providing opportunities for our employees to impact our business in innovative and creative ways. 
Campbell supports BRANs because they improve the performance and 
retention of their members and connect Campbell to consumers, both of which ultimately deliver sustainable business results. We currently have eight BRANs, with each sponsored by a member of our CEO’s Corporate Leadership Team.

Supplier Diversity
To operate most effectively in today’s diverse marketplace, we must strive for diversity not only among our employees and 
consumers, but also in our supply base. Our U.S. supplier diversity mission is to grant diverse suppliers equal access to potential business opportunities in an effort to strengthen our supply base, reflect the markets we serve and promote innovation. Diverse supply chain relationships strengthen our competitive position while contributing to our market share, total shareholder return, and to the quality of life in the communities where we live and work.
Simply stated, there is no other way for us to create and effectively market consumer food products in an increasingly 
multicultural world. We firmly believe that diverse suppliers have a positive impact on our business, consumers and community.

As our organization continues to be challenged by changing demographics, the supplier diversity program provides a 
tremendous opportunity to maximize the power of diversity and inclusion to drive superior business results and sustainable competitive advantage. Campbell realizes supplier diversity and business results are inseparable. Our diversity program mission is to foster a rich pool of qualified diverse suppliers that will add value to our business and help us achieve our long-term sustainable growth. Since the program’s inaugural year in FY2006, we have significantly increased our annual spend with women- and minority-owned businesses. 
In FY2012 Campbell exceeded its supplier diversity goal of $130MM by 
delivering over $142MM in diverse spend, which is a significant increase over the previous year’s spend of $128.5MM. Two new diverse suppliers were added in the Indirect category alone.
The supplier diversity program focused on four strategic areas:
1.
 Cr
eation of meaningful category strategies inclusive of supplier diversity 
as a key component;
2.
 Implementing “Supplier R
elationship Management” with key diverse 
suppliers to help grow their businesses, while better leveraging our 
spend;
3.
 Incr
easing diversity spend in non-discretionary areas; and
4.
 Gr
owing Direct and Indirect diversity spend to benchmark levels.
A key accomplishment during FY2012 was the design and implementation of a new Supplier Diversity Dashboard. This dashboard with automated data-feeds provides a real-time and ready tracker of our diverse spend cube.
In FY2012, the Supplier Diversity Team was recognized with an Extraordinary Performance Award. This internal recognition 
given to the ‘best of best’ projects and teams around the globe, signifies our commitment to supplier diversity and its importance to the success of our business

Our strong safety organization establishes direction and provides leadership in executing our Safety Plan. This plan aims to reduce injuries across all areas of our Company and to deliver world-class safety results.
Our Safety Plan includes:
– 
 De
velopment and implementation of global safety standards, including technology and online tools that help communicate 
safety measures clearly and consistently to our global workforce
– 
 Saf
ety training for all of our 11,400 supply chain employees outside of our World Headquarters location, with more than  
4,500 of them also receiving OSHA #501 advanced training on ergonomics, preventing slips and falls, and other topics
– Annual regional safety conferences to share best practices and develop safety teams
– Annual three-day audits of all locations, focusing on programs, conditions and behaviors– Safety recognition at Global Leadership Team meetings and through our Extraordinary Performance Awards
We know that to ensure safety in the workplace, our employees must be fully engaged and trained in appropriate safety 
procedures. Safety systems are embedded into plant operations through employee engagement initiatives such as our Daily Direction Setting process and our Extraordinary Employee Performance Work Systems. Each region within the Campbell organization conducts an annual health and safety conference to build awareness and strengthen the ties between operational safety and workplace wellness.

04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEESResults
Campbell’s workplace safety performance has exceeded food industry benchmarks for the past four years. For example, the 
industry averages 3.5 lost-time incidents for every 200,000 hours worked. Our rate is significantly lower. Over the past 10 years, our lost-time incident rate has improved more than 90% from 2.39 to .32. The sustained safety results reflect a culture shift within the Campbell organization toward an injury-free workplace. The Campbell Soup Company occupational injury and illness frequency rate per 200,000 hours for 2012 was 2.39. Campbell experienced no fatalities in FY2012.
Recognizing Achievements
Beyond tracking and improving injuries and illnesses, we believe it is also important to recognize our employees when they reach important safety milestones.
Campbell has implemented the Safety Flag Program to recognize key safety milestones at our locations. This program honors 
Campbell facilities where safety systems have kept employees safe from lost-time injuries on the job for at least one year or one million work hours. Today, 17 of Campbell’s 30 sites proudly fly the Safety Flag, many with gold Campbell “C”s added for reaching additional million-hour milestones.
Additionally, Campbell’s Global Safety Excellence Award recognizes up to three Campbell facilities each year for their ongoing 
efforts to instill a concern for workplace safety into their cultures. Plants are evaluated based on a number of criteria, including:
- Demonstrated safety results- Sustained safety systems- Achieving continued injury reduction- Safety leadership- Integration of safety systems- Employee ownership of safety efforts
Winning plants are recognized each year in June, which is marked nationwide as National Safety Month. Past winners include 
the Pepperidge Farm plant in Willard, Ohio, and the Campbell plant in Maxton, North Carolina
FOCUS FORWARD
The injury-free journey takes continuous improvement and diligence. Looking to the future, we will strengthen  
our ability to identify and share best practices and continue to advance the integration of safety and health management practices.

Deepening our commitment to environmental stewardship through strategies focused on 
reducing the resources we use in the production of our products
Campbell’s commitment to sustainability has evolved over more than 140 years into a set of 
business strategies and goals that will help us reduce our environmental footprint, as well as manage compliance, cost and efficiency.
This strategy has kept us focused on providing sustainable solutions — for our business as well as our stakeholders — especially 
in the areas of sustainable packaging, agriculture, plant operations, logistics and transportation. We take a precautionary approach to the environment by seeking to apply processes or practices with less environmental impact when possible. To integrate these environmental programs throughout our global business operations and ensure they have the biggest impact possible, we have established long-term destination goals and performance targets in six key areas:
– Energy– Carbon intensity– Water conservation– Waste management– Sustainable packaging– Sustainable agriculture

05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETManaging and Promoting Environmental Excellence
Oversight
We understand that to continue to advance in our sustainability practices and to meet our goals, we must have a sound 
environmental management system (EMS) in place. Over the past four years, we have worked diligently at strengthening an EMS that applies to our manufacturing facilities and integrates environmental programs through our business operations worldwide.
At the core of an effective EMS is strong governance and oversight. Campbell’s Board and CEO have chartered the 
Sustainability Leadership Team to lead the company’s sustainability efforts and climate policy.
This team (comprised of senior executives in charge of Environment, Supply Chain, Procurement, Manufacturing, Agriculture, 
Packaging and Logistics) drives climate change strategy for the Company globally and was instrumental in establishing Campbell’s 2020 Sustainability Goals, with each plant creating its own strategic operating plan to contribute to the overall goals.
Annual presentations on the company’s progress and status regarding climate change are made to the Audit Committee and 
Board of Directors. The environmental programs presentation includes progress on energy use and GHG emissions, energy conservation projects, water use, wastewater treatment and solid waste recycling and their resulting effects on climate change.
Measurement
The other key component of our EMS is the environmental performance software system, which was designed to ensure regulatory and corporate requirements are met. Campbell’s Environmental Management & Metrics System is used to collect and organize environmental documents (e.g., corporate policies, permits and reports) and activities (e.g., monitoring, measurement and reporting) to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements and management system standards. The EMS is also able to identify, track and report on key environmental parameters. 
Auditing
We audit our manufacturing facilities on a rolling schedule to verify compliance with environmental laws and company policies. These audits are based on the International Audit Protocol Consortium (IAPC) and any corrective actions generated are tracked within the environmental management system to ensure a timely reconciliation.
Enlistment and Engagement More
Campbell is also an active member of several groups globally who share goals of advancing sustainable innovation in business operations, supply chain and products. Internal experts from different disciplines participate in focus groups and committees focused on finding sustainable solutions in engineering, packaging, sustainable agriculture and life cycle assessment (LCA). We are also a member of the Sustainability Consortium, which regularly brings together independent scientists, researchers, and engineers from businesses, NGOs, government and leading academic research institutions around the world to build a scientific foundation that drives innovation to improve consumer product sustainability.
In 2012, Campbell employees participated in Earth Day activities at several facilities, which provided an opportunity for 
them to learn more about sustainability efforts across the company. In fact, Earth Day fairs and other activities were held at several locations, including our World Headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. These fairs have evolved as useful educational opportunities for our employees, helping them learn how Campbell and its vendors are reducing their carbon footprint and how they can also make a difference, both at work and at home.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  75
05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETResource Stewardship
Managing our environmental resources through strategies and focus areas that produce 
measurable results
As a global food manufacturer that relies on high-quality agricultural ingredients and products 
for our consumers, we are aware of our impact on the environment, as well as the potential risks to the food system posed by climate change. Our employees are committed to continuing our long-standing efforts to reduce the amount of energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and water use in our operations.
Teams at our plants implement strategies to reduce energy and water use in our manufacturing process. In the past four 
years, Campbell has completed a number of initiatives that have helped move toward our 2020 goal to cut our environmental footprint in half. These initiatives range from installing solar panels at several locations to the integration of motion detectors and energy-efficient lighting. Some specific initiatives are highlighted below.
Green Building Design
We have a commitment to utilize the U.S. Green Building Council LEED standards when constructing any significant new buildings. The Employee Center at Campbell’s World Headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, was designed from the ground up and was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council in June 2011.
The new Innovation Center at the Pepperidge Farm headquarters campus in Norwalk, CT opened September 2012. This $30 
million investment is designed as an environmentally friendly, LEED- Silver certified green building and employs a variety of energy efficient, water conservation and daylight harvesting techniques, while using recycled building materials in the construction.
Climate Strategy
Campbell’s climate strategy is integrated with our overall sustainable business strategy. Specific aspects include:
– Sustainable agriculture– Procurement– Supplier engagement– Performance reporting
In the short term, this strategy has resulted in specific capital improvements in operations, sustainability scorecard surveys 
in dialogue with suppliers, and tracking and reporting of performance across the Campbell plant network and to senior management.
Some of the most significant sustainability decisions that have been driven by our climate strategy include capital investments 
in energy and water conservation projects, as well as our partnership program to develop and construct renewable energy projects.Addressing Scope 3 Emissions
In 2011 we worked with the school of Supply Chain Management at MIT to assess the embedded (Scope 3) carbon 
impacts of five strategic ingredients, including beef, chicken, tomatoes, flour and oils. This exercise identified several new high-impact areas for us to investigate and potentially consider in future supplier arrangements. We also began quantifying the carbon impacts of our corporate business travel.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  76
05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET2012 Resource Management Highlights
Campbell’s Advanced Battery Technology Team slashed the average number of forklift batteries charged at our North 
American thermal plants from more than 1,000 per day to 83, and the number of batteries kept on hand from 1,000 to 600. They improved battery life by more than 25%, while achieving annual cost savings of $1.7 million in FY2011.
Campbell’s V8 Packaging Team eliminated the use of a cardboard insert inside the trays of 1.89L V8 and V8 Splash products. 
This resulted in the elimination of approximately 900,000 cardboard sleeves, resulting in a yearly savings of approximately $230,000.
Campbell’s Energy Network Team led several initiatives that reduced water, fuels and electricity needed to make our products. 
Since 2005, the team reduced water use by approximately 20% and energy use by 21% per tonne of food produced. Over the past year, Campbell’s reduced its water use by 400 million gallons, while water use per tonne of product remained flat. Additionally, energy use per tonne of product was reduced by 5%. Cost of energy per case of product produced was reduced by more than 20%. These projects are providing annual savings ranging from $2.5 million to $5 million.
These teams have been recognized at Campbell’s Extraordinary Performance Awards ceremonies — the Company’s premier 
team recognition event.
Nurturing Renewable Energy
To reach our 2020 destination goal of reducing GHG emissions by 50% per tonne of product produced, we projected that Campbell needed to receive 40% of its electricity from renewable or GHG-free sources. With the installation and completion of our renewable energy systems, totaling 33,000 solar panels, 8% of Campbell’s global electric power is being sourced by renewable energy. In FY2012, our operational systems included:
A 60-acre, 10-megawatt (MW) solar panel project constructed adjacent to the Napoleon, Ohio, manufacturing facility
This system was constructed by BNB Renewable Energy, and a power purchase agreement is in place, committing Campbell to buy 100% of the electricity generated by the system for the next 20 years. The system became operational in December 2011 and consists of over 24,000 solar panels mounted on mechanisms that track the sun each day from east to west, and efficiently positions each panel at the optimum angle to generate the most electricity. It is estimated that the system will generate approximately 15% of the electricity needed to run the Napoleon operations, the largest soup-manufacturing plant in the world.
A 12-acre, 2-MW solar panel project under construction on our Sacramento, California, property
This system began generating electricity in 2012. This system consists of approximately 8,000 solar panels mounted on a similar geo-tracker mechanism and is expected to generate approximately 10% of the electricity needed for the operation of the property.
A 250-kilowatt (kW) system installed at our facility in Puurs, Belgium
This system will provide approximately 8% of the electricity needed to run the plant’s operations.
A 100-kW system placed into operation at our facility in Paris, Texas
This system was constructed on top of a canopy over the ingredient truck storage area. It consists of over 400 solar panels and began generating solar energy in August 2011.
Currently, Campbell has a working agreement with a development company for installing additional solar panel systems at 
five locations (Camden NJ, Maxton NC, Bloomfield CT, Toronto Canada and Willard OH), providing an additional 4% renewable electricity, wind turbines at Paris and Willard, providing 5% additional renewable electricity, plus seven digester/generators which will provide an additional 15% renewable electricity. At the completion of these systems, projected by the end of FY15, Campbell will source 32% of its global electricity with renewable electricity. These figures reflect Campbell as the host facility for these renewable energy systems. Campbell will purchase all generated electricity from these systems, however, all associated renewable energy credits will be sold by the development company as a mechanism for funding the projects.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  77
05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETInvesting in Improved Compliance and Sustainability 
Performance
We are investing in a variety of new projects that advance environmental 
sustainability and will help us reduce the current environmental footprint of our operations. These specific projects have improved the efficiency of our facilities and reduced our need for electricity, fuels and water.
We strive to comply with environmental laws and regulations while reducing 
our impact on the environment in our local communities by employing multiple resources, including water treatment systems, wastewater treatment systems and air emission controls. Each year, we invest significant capital to maintain and improve these operations.
Since 2009, sustainability investments across Campbell’s plant network 
have yielded savings of more than $42.9 million.
Waste Management
We apply a consistent approach to managing the waste generated in our offices and plant operations and employ a hierarchical decision-making process for reducing, reusing and recycling our operations to minimize the impact our production has on the environment, while reducing total costs.
Strategic initiatives are implemented to reduce these various waste streams. We leverage the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s Food Waste Recovery Hierarchy to prioritize our food waste reduction efforts. Campbell actively participates on the Leadership Committee of a new three-year initiative launched by the Grocery Manufacturers Association and Food Marketing Institute to help the industry reduce levels of food waste. Efforts such as reducing the amount of food manufacturing waste and reusing waste product as either an animal feed or compost have reduced the amount of waste we send to local landfills.
Material Use and Recycling
Closed-loop options and beneficial reuse principles guide our processes when it comes to recycling materials. We continue to expand our comprehensive recycling programs as we strive to achieve our worldwide 95% recycle rate goal. Current programs to recycle food waste, corrugated paper, steel drums, office paper, plastic, fluorescent tubes, batteries, wood pallets and scrap metal are being evaluated to ensure maximum efficiency.
Part of this effort included the diversion of off-specification product from local landfills to a facility that can remove the 
container to reuse the food material as animal feed ingredients.
In FY2012, Campbell generated 281,693 metric tonnes of solid waste from our worldwide operations, of this, 240,695 metric 
tonnes were recycled and 40,998 were disposed of in local landfills or utilized as fuel for resource recovery facilities. Hazardous waste comprises <0.06% of total waste generated.
Campbell’s worldwide recycle rate for FY2012 was 85%.
Global Asset Recovery
The Campbell Asset Recovery Team works globally to find beneficial reuse or recycling options for some of the food-processing 
and electronic equipment we no longer use or need. We maintain an on-line marketplace and data-tracking tools to help facilitate this program. In FY2012, Campbell recycled or reused close to 1.4 million pounds of used equipment and generated nearly $962,000 in revenue from the sale of used equipment.

05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETWater Resource Mapping
Assessing our global water use and looking for ways to maximize water efficiencies
Water is an integral component in the production of all food and beverages. At Campbell, we  
use water in many of our products, as well as for cleaning, cooking, and vegetable transport  within our plants. Maintaining a clean and sustainable supply of water is essential both to the future of our Company and the future of our communities.
Complex Use
All of our manufacturing plants have implemented water conservation measures and have established systems to ensure  
that water used in our operations is appropriately cleaned and treated before it is returned to the environment. Our water  use is complex and affects every aspect of our production and distribution process. For example, we use water:
– To wash ingredients– To cool finished products– To satisfy our steam requirements– To clean and sanitize our operations– As an ingredient in our products
All Campbell operations provide wastewater treatment through the use of either a Company-owned treatment system or 
through treatment prior to discharge to a municipal-owned treatment facility. We apply a stewardship philosophy when it comes to water, by advancing conservation across our enterprise and committing to returning clean and appropriately  treated water to our local communities. Water conservation goals are included in business-level operational scorecards.
As water demand increases to sustain environmental and human needs, Campbell is continually looking for sustainable  
solutions to maximize its water efficiencies.
Site-by-Site Water Scarcity Mapping
In 2011, Campbell performed a site-by-site mapping of water usage and cross-referenced the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Global Water Tool to include near- and long-term water scarcity. The WBCSD created the Global Water Tool to help companies map their facilities’ water intake, recycled water and wastewater extraction procedures.
The tool, using close to 30 external datasets from various research and creditable sources, analyzes our plant data (geospatial 
and water records) against the external datasets to provide us with fundamental information on water dependency, water purification/treatment and water risk on a country level, as well as water supply and water scarcity per country, and local watershed levels.
While we currently account for gross water use metrics, we have not fully accounted for our very strong water recycling  
and stewardship practices in the following table. In coming years, we will strive to strengthen the full gross-net water management data.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  79

World Headquarters in April 2011. Pepperidge Farm continued to invest capital in the new package format for Goldfish bread products that reduces plastic usage by 65%.
Packaging Challenges
A topic that continues to receive increased attention is the use of a material called bisphenol A (BPA). BPA is widely used in the lining of metal food containers to prevent corrosion and help maintain the food’s safety, quality and flavor. Campbell — with our suppliers — has been researching alternatives to BPA that perform as well as existing packaging.
We believe that the current can packaging technology used in our products 
is one of the safest food package options in the world. However, we have been studying the issue and recognize that there has been a debate over the use of BPA.
For more than 140 years, we’ve earned consumers’ trust — and we intend to 
keep it. We have already started using packaging lined with a BPA alternative in some of our soups, and we are working to phase out the use of BPA in can linings in the rest of our canned products.

05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETSustainable Agriculture
Collaborating with farmers and applying comprehensive agricultural science to strengthen our 
agricultural programs
Stakeholder-driven priorities for Sustainable Agriculture Programs
In 2012 Campbell launched its Agriculture Sustainability Programs, building on decades of investment 
in agriculture research and partnerships with farmers.
As part of the launch process, a series of stakeholder interviews was conducted by Dr. Daniel Sonke, Campbell’s Manager of 
Agriculture Sustainability Programs. Approximately 50 interviews were conducted, including Campbell employees in North America and internationally. Interviews were also conducted with farmers and representatives of agriculture suppliers, retail and food service companies who purchase from Campbell and nongovernmental organizations that have an interest in the environmental and social aspects of farming.
Interviewees were asked a host of questions regarding their perception of Campbell, sustainability, target audiences for the 
Agriculture Sustainability Programs, priority focus areas related to environmental and social impacts of farming, and supply chain areas in which to focus beyond tomatoes. The results of the stakeholder interviews were compiled and utilized in strategic planning in 2012.
As a result, in 2012 a strategic plan was developed for Campbell Agriculture Sustainability focusing on tomatoes and other 
vegetables important to Campbell. Because processing tomato production is where Campbell has its closest relationship with farmers, this makes it the chief focus for the first years. While other crops are important to the company, our stakeholders overwhelmingly suggested we focus on the vegetable crops important to both our iconic and our innovative product categories.
Tomatoes: An Iconic - and Mainstay - Campbell Crop
Campbell Soup Company began as a preserve company in 1869 and canned tomatoes from the very 
beginning. The first soup made by the company (in 1895) was tomato soup. Today, we use tomatoes in a wide range of soups, sauces and beverages, and have a close relationship with tomato farmers. Thus, tomatoes have been a primary focus of the company’s long-running sustainable agriculture efforts.
In 1947, Campbell opened its tomato processing operations in California. At least one tomato farming family has been selling 
to the company ever since that first season. All of the contract farms that sell tomatoes directly to Campbell are family owned and 22% are minority-owned. Most of them are third- or fourth-generation farmers and many have been Campbell’s preferred suppliers for more than one generation. Today, California’s tomato farmers have their own membership-based cooperative bargaining agreement, which negotiates an industry price with Campbell and other processors. Since the 1950s, the processing tomatoes in California have been harvested by machine, unlike fresh market tomatoes.
Processing tomatoes are vine-ripened and harvested at peak red ripeness. The majority of tomatoes used by Campbell are 
grown in the productive Central Valley farming region of California and processed at Campbell-owned plants. This region is highly diverse, with over 300 crops grown, and renowned for its high-quality production. For this reason, the region produces 95% of U.S. processing tomatoes.
As much as possible, tomatoes are sourced from farms located close to the plants to minimize transportation distance and 
time and the associated fuel use. In 2012, the average distance from field to plant was 37 miles. Campbell’s agriculture team continues to look for ways to reduce this distance even more Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  85
05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETAgriculture Sustainability Priorities
The following priority subject areas for Campbell Agriculture Sustainability Programs were identified as important to 
stakeholders and the company:- Water use - efficient irrigation to conserve water resources- Greenhouse gasses - focusing on efficient nitrogen use, since in tomato production nitrogen fertilizer is the largest source  
of greenhouse gasses
- Fertilizer use - besides producing greenhouse gasses, fertilizer can move into surface and groundwater resources if not  
utilized efficiently
- Soil quality - enhancing soil organic matter benefits crop production, enhances water infiltration, and reduces soil nutrient loss- Pesticides - use of preventative practices first, using pesticides only optimally and as a last resort
In these 5 categories, we will pursue benchmarking with quantitative metrics where possible and track progress over time.
Specific reduction goals were established in the strategic plan. The 2020 goals are to:- Reduce water use per lb. of ingredient by 20%- Reduce nitrogen applied per lb. of ingredient by 10%- Reduce GHGs per lb. of ingredient by 20%
Real World Knowledge
In 2012, Campbell agriculture staff worked with tomato farmers to establish baseline data for Campbell Agriculture Sustainability priority areas. Beginning with the 2012 harvest, data is being benchmarked related to the five priority areas. As nearly 700 fields are contracted for the season, the data collection effort is involved but yields high quality data once complete. 
As the saying goes, you can’t manage what you don’t measure. This is true on two levels - by collecting the data, Campbell can 
identify opportunities for improvement across geography, identify early adopters and farmer innovators; but also, by showing an individual farmer how their average compares with the statewide average, they can be encouraged to find opportunities to improve on their farm.
Efficient Irrigation
Drip irrigation is one of the most effective ways to reduce the amount of water used per pound of tomato production. Campbell encourages its growers to utilize this technology where it is cost-effective to do so (to install drip irrigation requires hundreds to over $1000 per acre). In 2008, approximately 20% of the acres producing tomatoes for the company utilized drip irrigation. In 2012, this had increased to approximately 38%. The developing Campbell Agriculture Sustainability Program is also investigating opportunities to promote the continued adoption of water conservation practices both in tomato farming and processing. In 2012, one of the Campbell tomato processing facilities was able to reduce water use by 10% over the previous season, per ton of tomatoes processed.
Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
Campbell helped pioneer the use of IPM in the California processing tomato industry. Award-winning research and outreach to growers in the 1990s resulted in a significant reduction in pesticide applications. In addition, by California state law, all farmers must utilize licensed Pest Control Advisers trained in IPM to identify the need for pesticides prior to their application. In 2012, Campbell continued to add more disease-resistant tomato varieties to our agriculture program with the goal of reducing or eliminating pesticide use due to new plant diseases.
Sustainable Agriculture Research
In 2012, the Campbell Research and Development and Campbell Agriculture teams partnered on a project to correlate water conservation in tomato irrigation with improved tomato quality. The project is meant to take University of California research and refine it for implementation on farm.
The Campbell Agriculture team also partnered with University of California researchers to look at a form of furrow irrigation that 
would utilize less water. The project also analyzed greenhouse gas production from fields using different irrigation and fertilizer rates. Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  86
05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETWater Reclamation and Wildlife Habitat
The Campbell tomato processing plant in rural Dixon, California, utilizes agricultural land to treat rinse water coming from the 
plant during tomato season. The water is applied to pasture land as irrigation, allowing it to be filtered by the pasture prior to returning to groundwater or evaporating. The pasture is then used for cattle and hay production.
In 2011, Campbell made a commitment to enhance the property’s benefits to wildlife. In 2012, the management of the property 
was changed such that it reduced the need to cut hay during waterfowl nesting season, reducing the risk of destroying nests. Twenty owl boxes were also established on the property to provide natural pest management and biodiversity.
In coming years Campbell will work with its property managers to further enhance the property’s ability to support wildlife 
while still supporting the primary task of water reclamation.
A Special Water Quality Enhancement Project
In 2008, the Ohio EPA and Campbell signed an agreement. In lieu of costly infrastructure changes or a fine, Campbell would invest $50,000 per year for 10 years in nitrate management projects on farms upstream of Campbell’s Napoleon, Ohio plant. The plant is located along the Maumee River approximately 45 miles upstream from where it empties into Lake Erie. Occasional spikes of nitrates in the river from non-point sources such as farms are a problem for the Lake, which can suffer eutrophication as a result. The non-profit Conservation Action Project of Ohio works with farmers to invest the dollars in restoring on-farm wetlands, cover cropping and a technology called “controlled drainage” to reduce movement of fertilizer into drainage systems. As of 2011 the project had estimated that over 65 tons of nitrogen had been prevented from entering the Maumee River and Lake Erie.
Supply Chain, Logistics and Transportation
Managing the sourcing of our products from farm to fork, including procurement and distribution
Campbell Logistics: Engaged Supply Chain, Efficient Procurement  
and Distribution System
Campbell’s global supply chain organization is responsible for all aspects of our production from farm to fork, including 
procurement, engineering, manufacturing, quality assurance and distribution. Our supply chain organization works across Campbell locations and manufacturing facilities around the world. These employees work in close collaboration with our suppliers, research and development teams, and trade partners to optimize the supply chain from beginning to end. We understand and appreciate the complexity and diversity of our supply chain, and to continually make progress our initiatives focus on safety, quality, ethical and responsible sourcing, total delivered cost (TDC) and environmental sustainability, as well as customer service.
Supply Chain Initiatives: Educate, Engage, Impact
Campbell continues to further develop projects that reduce our environmental impact while promoting safe, healthy, nutritious products. At Campbell, our commitment to Nourishing Our Planet begins with actively engaging the supply chain. By partnering with suppliers, we strive to minimize our footprint from the delivery of ingredients to our facilities to distribution of high-quality, finished products to our consumers. Our manufacturing facilities continue to produce over 90% of all Campbell-labeled products.
To optimize our supply chain, we continually utilize initiatives designed towards education, engaging, and impacting our 
suppliers to adapt with the challenges of an ever-changing global environment. In order to achieve this goal, we applied the same stringent standards we place on ourselves to our vendors while maintaining and sourcing the high-quality ingredients that our customers and consumers have come to expect.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  87

Suppliers
Building a Robust Supplier Base
As a consumer goods company, one of our primary objectives is to provide safe, quality products that exceed our customers’ and consumers’ expectations. We realize that our suppliers and other business partners play a critical role in helping us execute this mission and our commitment to sustainability in an ethical and responsible manner. For Campbell, it is of utmost importance that they share our objectives.
CSR/Sustainability Supplier Requirements
Because corporate social responsibility is an integral mission at Campbell, we also require our suppliers to follow rigorous CSR and sustainability standards.
Campbell’s Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual identifies the expectations and requirements of all firms 
that are, and aspire to be, a Campbell supplier. The requirements detailed in the manual are designed to help our current and potential brokers, co-packers, re-packers, special packers, suppliers, warehouses and licensees to meet these objectives. We consider adherence and performance to these expectations as essential factors when entering into or extending existing business relationships. These requirements include:– Legal, Health and Safety, and Environment
– Employment Standards– Anti-Corruption– Animal Welfare– Compliance
Employment Standards are of particular concern to Campbell, with prescriptive requirements for the following areas:
– Minimum Employment Age
– Voluntary Labor– Wages and Benefits– Working Hours and Rest– Discrimination– Freedom of Association– Fair Treatment
Building upon the success of FY2011, we focused on the following key areas 
in FY2012:
Collaborating with suppliers on animal welfare
Campbell is committed to the humane treatment of animals and believes that ethical sourcing is an important part of our vision 
for sustainable supply.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  88
05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETAfter benchmarking with industry peers and partnering with key suppliers, Campbell developed its own animal welfare policy. 
To ensure adherence to this policy and its effectiveness, Campbell implemented it as part of its Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual in FY2012.
To further expand on our animal welfare policy and address emerging issues, we also issued additional guidance in FY2012. In 
this context, Campbell is working towards the elimination of gestation crates in our pork supply chain. Campbell will continue to favor suppliers that raise hogs in gestation crate-free environments.
Increasing focus on sustainability through strategic-supplier partnerships
One formal way in which we closely collaborate with strategic suppliers on sustainability issues is through our Strategic Supplier Relationship Management program. Through this program, we have enhanced and expanded regular communications and idea exchange with select strategic suppliers. The results of our efforts have delivered valuable information that has prepared Campbell for current and emerging issues relevant to CSR. We, in turn, are able to mitigate the risk and costs associated with unforeseen trends as well as improve business process and the supply chain, as it relates to sustainability.
Typical topics addressed through ongoing, formal and informal communication with strategic suppliers include:
– 
 Sus
tainability best practice sharing
– 
 Sus
tainability idea generation
– 
 Sus
tainability practice implementation
– 
 Sus
tainability program tracking and corrective action-taking
–

try and market trend review
Developing supplier sustainability-KPIs
In order to measure the effectiveness of a supplier’s sustainability program, Campbell began work on developing an improved 
‘sustainability scorecard’ with its strategic suppliers. This scorecard is intended to rate the quality of the vendor’s supply chain sustainability efforts, potentially identifying supply chain inefficiencies and opportunities, and also serve as a competitive differentiator. This work also leverages the progress from our partnership with the school of Supply Chain Management at MIT in FY2011.
In FY2012, Campbell began measuring select areas of Scope 3 (indirect) Greenhouse Gas Emissions. While the process for 
measuring indirect emissions can be difficult, partnering with various suppliers has helped streamline our system. In FY2012 Campbell implemented a new system, the ‘Concur Travel CO2 Emissions Tracker’. With this, Campbell can now verify and calculate the carbon footprint of every mile traveled by employees through air and rail, using our electronic travel booking program. 
Engaging with the supply-base and third-parties
Campbell engages with other suppliers beyond the strategic supply base (these being labeled as ‘leverage’ suppliers), through a variety of ‘methods’ and on a variety of topics, such as: 
– 
 Senior management discus
sions (method example)
– 
 P
olicy input solicitation (topic example)
– 
 R
eadiness assessment surveys (topic example)
– 
 Other e
xternal and internal surveys (method example)
In addition, we plan key events throughout the year, such as ‘Earth Day’, to invite suppliers to present their sustainability 
programs to all Campbell employees. Such initiatives allow suppliers to showcase new sustainable practices, and also provide employees with a holistic view of the Campbell supply chain.
We also partner with industry peers and non-government organizations (NGOs) that align with our vision of sustainable supply. 
Together, we share common interests to protect our brand, deliver uncompromising value to our customers, and produce quality products for our consumers while reducing our impact on the environment.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  89
05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETImplementation of Supplier Standards
Campbell has established a variety of elements to assure effective implementation of its standards for suppliers. We began 
our global supplier management program by first setting requirements for our supply base that apply equally to both foreign and domestic suppliers. We anchored our program with a Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual (SBREM), first published in 1988, that outlines the food safety and quality expectations of Campbell Soup Company. This document is currently posted on Campbell’s external website and is updated on an annual basis.
The on-site audit itself is derived directly from the SBREM and comprised of (26) key sections with 195 questions to be 
completed by a Campbell certified auditor. All direct material suppliers are subject to our performance management process that includes continuous monitoring of the risk they may present to our business which includes re-auditing at appropriate frequency. Audits have been conducted at over 90% of our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities in 55 countries over the past three years. We have completed more than 2,400 vendor audits against our audit standards that include CSR and sustainability requirements. In addition to our internal auditors, we have also initiated third-party audits to keep accountability and performance high.
Campbell plants and contract manufacturers are now required to obtain Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI)–recognized Food 
Safety and Quality systems certifications by an independent third party. Campbell North America manufacturing plants were certified in 2009, while our international and core contract manufacturer plants were certified in 2010.
In addition, Campbell also assures effective implementation of standards through our Supplier Sustainability Scorecarding 
efforts. At the end of 2011, Campbell outlined its supplier expectations and performance in accordance with California’s new Human Trafficking and Slavery in the Supply Chain law.
Managing Noncompliance
We hold our employees and leadership to the highest ethical and compliance standards. Our suppliers are no different. To that end, Campbell has implemented stringent policies and procedures for managing noncompliance among suppliers.
We have processes, documentation tools and software systems established for reporting individual incoming ingredient and 
direct food contact packaging nonconformance, engaging the supplier in corrective action plans and timing, and documenting closure of the report. Ongoing nonconformance trends are monitored and, when warranted, further improvement planning is established to address supplier or material category performance issues. Based on possible regulatory actions, nonconformance risk or frequency of occurrence, suppliers are subjected to a Campbell Audit focusing on the specific issues that may result in corrective action requirements and/or disqualification as a supplier. Deep processes are also in place to link consumer product complaints to specific ingredients or packaging materials.
This information is further used to take corrective action with specific suppliers and/or drive supplier development programs. 
As defined by policies, Campbell and/or third-party, food safety and quality audits are conducted to assess the compliance to 
system requirements and the effectiveness of these systems.
Supply Chain Challenges
As a food and beverage company, we are often challenged with campaigns by nongovernmental organizations and others 
concerned about the safety and quality of our products. We work closely with suppliers, industry and professional associations, academic institutions and other outside experts to identify new and emerging issues in chemical, food safety and packaging technologies to ensure that our ingredients and packaging materials conform to the most rigorous scientific and technical standards.
Palm Oil
Food companies may be challenged for their sourcing of sustainable palm oil by NGOs.
Palm oil is used in products like cookies and crackers, and the concern is that the industry is harming fragile ecosystems by 
expanding industrialized palm oil plantations. As a food company, Campbell recognizes the connection between the long-term vitality of our business and the imperative to advance environmental sustainability. We take this commitment very seriously.Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  90
05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANETOur palm oil suppliers are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) — composed of palm growers, palm oil 
users, retail food chains and nongovernmental organizations — an association created to promote the development and use of sustainable palm oil through cooperation within the supply chain and open dialogue with its stakeholders.
Campbell’s global businesses are striving to convert to certified sustainable sources of palm oil by 2015.
Transportation
We continue gradually to make progress in reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions through our complex 
transportation fleet and logistics systems. We understand that transportation of raw materials, ingredients and finished products from farm to factory to stores presents multiple opportunities to create efficiencies. 
A majority of our transportation is contractual, and therefore impacts our Scope 3, or embedded, carbon impact. Our goals for 
reducing our carbon footprint include reductions of our Scope 3 emissions through supply chain efficiencies. Because most of our transportation is provided through contracted carriers, reducing our carbon footprint requires cross-sector collaboration, cooperation on new approaches and the commitment of our shipping partners. 
We are also aware of the debate and trends in seeking alternative transportation fuels including those that may be derived 
with lower environmental impact. Our goal to reduce our environmental footprint extends through our supply network and to achieve this, we will collaborate with our customers and suppliers on those strategies. Our goal is to raise awareness and promote adoption of more energy efficient methods, inputs and fuels within our suppliers and across our transportation network. In 2013, we will continue to educate our suppliers and internal supply chain while working with our business partners to continuously optimize through multiple joint programs including: 
– 
 Incr
easing use of heavy payload equipment;
– 
 Pr
omoting the shift to alternative or lower environmental impact fuels;
– 
 C
onverting higher percentage of loads to intermodal versus over-the-road;
–

 Ensuring tha
t all of our carriers are “SmartWay” certified; with the goal of ensuring that the remainder of our partners are 
qualified by 2013 ; and
– 
 Inc
orporating sustainability initiatives into our carrier sourcing criteria.
In 2012, we continued to focus on increasing intermodal transportation. Intermodal freight shipping has become the number-
one segment of all rail shipments. Each train can take up to 500 trucks off the highways and, on average, railways are more than three times more fuel efficient than trucks.

Inspections, Compliance and Investment
Our Environmental Sustainability Policy clearly outlines the expectation that all our plants and facilities around the world be 
operated in accordance with environmental laws and our own high-performance expectations. Our Napoleon, Ohio, facility, for example, continues to work with the Conservation Action Project (CAP) in Northwest Ohio to reduce runoff from agricultural land and reduce nitrate-nitrogen in the Maumee River. We have made a total of $225,000 in donations over the past four years to CAP as part of our 10-year commitment to this project.
While we strive for perfect compliance every day, we also plan to be transparent in the areas that need improvement. The 
following table outlines the regulatory enforcement activities that occurred during fiscal year 2012.
FOCUS FORWARD
In the coming months, we plan to develop and implement a series of initiatives to further engage our supply chain 
and increase our outreach to suppliers, internal stakeholders, and customers. These projects include supplier diversity training for employees, ethical sourcing education for buyers and developing supplier sustainability profiles that align with scorecard ratings.

In this report, we strive to provide our stakeholders with a balanced view of our CSR and sustainability strategy and performance in our worldwide operations during fiscal year 2012 (ended July 31, 2012). This report includes an update to key programs and performance metrics. Our previous report was published in May 2012. Significant policy or program advances and recognition occurring after FY2012 may also be included.
We prepared this report using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, along with the GRI 
Food Processing Sector Supplement. We have self-declared this CSR Report to a GRI Application Level of “B” based on the  GRI Application Level Grid. A GRI Content Index is provided here .
This Campbell CSR Report addresses our operations on a global basis. Unless otherwise stated, principles and policies referenced in the report apply to all Company-owned locations worldwide, and to all employees of Campbell Soup Company. This report does not include Bolthouse Farms as this acquisition did not occur until fiscal year 2013.
The metrics and goals in this report are established and measured by the Campbell business units and corporate functions that 
are responsible for achieving them. This is done in consultation with internal and, in some cases, external stakeholders, as well as by reference to external benchmarks and leadership practices. Our goal is to deliver a useful and accurate picture of our performance.
Data collection in a multinational manufacturing company is complex, and there are meaningful challenges to compiling 
consistent performance metrics across numerous plant and facility sites in multiple countries. While this report includes globally consistent metrics in most areas, we continue to work on improving the standardization of our measurement systems and building baselines in other areas, such as agriculture. Performance metrics cover Campbell owned and operated facilities. Environmental metrics are reported using widely accepted parameters and units. We use the Carbon Disclosure Project Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate our GHG emissions. Nutrition metrics are fully described with footnotes and references. Financial data is presented in U.S. dollars.
Campbell management uses a system of internal controls, including a process of verification by internal subject-matter experts, 
to ensure that this report fairly represents our CSR and environmental sustainability activities and results.
The full version of this report can be downloaded from the Reports & Data section of this website. A printed highlights brochure 
is also available by request.
Additional information about Campbell operations and financial performance is available in our 2012 Annual Report and Form 
10-K, which are both available on our corporate website .

06 / RESOURCESIndependent Review Letter by Business  
for Social Responsibility
Campbell Soup Company requested BSR to conduct an independent review of its Corporate 
Social Responsibility Report covering activities and performance in 2011. We highlight areas of strengths and challenges, and in the process provide suggestions for ways that Campbell Soup can enhance its future reporting. It should be noted that our review neither verifies nor expresses an opinion on the accuracy or timeliness of information provided in this report.
Strengths and Achievements
Clear presentation of efforts to enhance the nutrition and health profile of its product portfolioHealth and nutrition are critical issues for any food company, and the 2012 report increases the depth of coverage on how Campbell is adjusting its products to make them healthier and the impact that is having on its financial results. In addition, it explains how its products assist in the fulfillment of nutritional requirements for vegetables and fruits and whole grains, and impact heart health and weight control. And finally, the report provides detail on the development of new products and the modification of existing ones in order to make them healthier, and data on the revenue increases for such products over time.
We hope that future reports build on this foundation by showing the company’s progress in enhancing the nutritional profile 
of Campbell’s products and the establishment of measurable timebound targets against which to assess performance. It would also be useful if a clear narrative were provided around the overall objectives of Campbell’s nutrition program and how individual product modifications fit into this framework.
Commitment to establishing performance metrics for its key community initiatives
Campbell has adopted two impressive goals related to its community initiatives: reduce childhood obesity and hunger by 50% by 2020 and make a positive impact on 100 million youth through its community outreach efforts. This year’s report notes that it will establish outcome measures related to food security and obesity by the end of 2012. We believe that this is a critical step in the evolution of Campbell’s community programs, and we expect that next year’s report will provide greater detail about these performance metrics and how they are being implemented.
More extensive coverage of environmental initiatives and performance
This year’s report provides more in-depth discussion of a number of critical environmental issues, including green building, renewable energy, water resource mapping and sustainable agriculture. Noteworthy is the focus on water resources, and particularly the analysis of water usage and the calculation of that usage on water scarcity in the areas surrounding many of Campbell’s facilities. Measuring and reporting water scarcity is a leadership practice in the food and beverage industry, and we hope that the analysis will be expanded in future reports to give a full picture of the impact on water resources of Campbell’s facilities and its agricultural operations, which form the foundation of Campbell’s business.
Greater detail on public policy activities
Although covered to a degree in previous CSR reports, this year’s edition provides more detail on the kinds of issues that Campbell engages on in the public policy arena and the positions it supports. Many stakeholders are interested in the role that companies play in influencing public policy, and the transparency shown by Campbell should allow for a greater understanding of its activities in this area.
Challenges and Opportunities
Balance discussion of successes and challengesAs in our review of last year’s report, we recommend that Campbell provide a fuller account of the challenges that it faces across product formulation (health & wellness), environmental, social and community issues. One key characteristic of highly regarded CSR reports is the open recognition of challenges across the spectrum of CSR issues, and we believe that Campbell’s report needs to acknowledge such challenges and provide a thorough discussion of them. For example, the decision in 2011 to increase the amount of sodium in its soup products is clearly a challenge to the general trend evidenced in this report of Campbell taking steps to enhance the health profile of its product portfolio; stakeholders would benefit from a discussion of this decision and any implications it might have for future product adjustments. Calling out challenges also serves as an opportunity 
Campbell Soup Company 2013 Performance Update of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report  105
06 / RESOURCESto create a call to action that seeks the participation of others to address issues that are multidimensional in nature, such as the 
goal of receiving 40% of electricity from renewable or GHG-free sources by 2020.
Provide more thorough explanation of data
The Performance Scorecard is a useful way of presenting Campbell’s social and environmental data, but there are no targets against which success is being measured. In addition, the report is lacking analysis that provides perspective and context to the data. For example, both energy use and water consumption declined from 2008 to 2011, but there is no way for the reader to know why this happened and what, if any, links this has to Campbell’s CSR activities. We recommend that such analysis occur in the specific sections where the issues are discussed in more detail.
Clearly identify the most material issues
The report provides a thorough description of the materiality process that Campbell conducts each year to ensure that it is focused on the right social and environmental issues. But while it identifies these issues, it fails to clearly define what they mean to Campbell and how they were derived. For example, advertising and labeling are classified as among the most material issues facing Campbell, and yet they are barely discussed in the report. Greater clarity in the materiality process is important because it underlies the content of the report as well as the company’s overall CSR strategy. Stakeholders would benefit from knowing more about how the material issues were chosen, including what trade-offs, if any, were made in the process of evaluating the various business and stakeholder criteria used in their prioritization.
Share how stakeholder input is being incorporated
We applaud Campbell for looking externally for input on its activities and stated focus for active engagement; however, it isn’t clear from the report how this input is influencing or being incorporated into its decisions or activities. As noted in our letter last year, it would be useful to have a discussion of the stakeholder’s perspectives and how these are being used to assess market positioning, product developments and enterprise risk.
Summary
Campbell’s 2012 report builds on previous editions by expanding the coverage of a number of critical issues and establishing important commitments relating to its supply chain and community initiatives. To realize its full potential as an engagement and communication tool for both internal and external stakeholders, however, the report’s content needs to be sharply focused on those social and environmental challenges that are most material to Campbell, and greater context and clarity provided regarding Campbell’s objectives and vision — against which annual progress can be evaluated. This will, in turn, lead to a shorter and more impactful report that will serve Campbell well in an age of increasing stakeholder expectations and hyper-transparency.
