For the past eight years Telecom Italia Group has published a special report to evaluate the
satisfaction of the Stakeholders on which the Group depends and, at the same time, influences 
by its own activities: Customers, Suppliers, Competitors, Institutions, the Environment, theCommunity, Human Resources and Shareholders.
For the past three years The Annual Report has included the Sustainability section in order to
confirm the Group’s commitment to report on its financial and non-financial performance.
The paragraph on Shareholders also contains information on Financial Communications and the
Safeguarding of Privacy.…The flattering acclaim given by the market to our reorganization process is indicative of
the credibility and trust which we have been able to generate. Credibility and trust havecertainly found solid motivations in the strictness and transparency of the decisions taken at
managerial level and in the complete sustainability of our conduct. Furthermore, the
reliability of the Group is confirmed by the fact that it is capable of generating growth in allits main business units.
…Telecom Italia hopes to succeed in maintaining its position as European leader in a world
of telecommunications that is rapidly changing…Telecommunications have now become a
hi-tech sector and, as such, are destined to pla yafundamental and driving role in economic
and social development.
As far as we are concerned, it is a role for which we feel responsible and which we shall play
with the utmost commitment, sustained by the enormous wealth of ability, competence andprofessional skills of the people who work for our Group. Their intelligence and their
enthusiasm have been crucial in making the Telecom Italia Group’s industrial plan into a
success in such a short time.

Telecom Italia Group’s customers are one of its main assets, and so the Group has decided to
include customer focus, pro-action and transparency of information among its primary corporate
values.
Satisfaction expressed by the customer is a fundamental prerequisite for the creation of value and
maintaining market leadership. The Group undertakes several initiatives to pursue full customersatisfaction:
•within the framework of performance related compensation, Telecom Italia SpA has adopted a
target linked to customer satisfaction, in fact, alongside the profitability indicator (gross
opera ting profit), a Customer Loyalty indicator has been added that carries a weight of 30% on
the performance related compensation. The indicator is an average of customer satisfaction
with regard to offered services, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), image andtechnical quality;
• an Integrated Feedback System is presently being used at Telecom Italia SpA. The main objective
of this project is to allow customer’s opinions to reach strategic and managing levels. In thiswaythe Group has a better understanding of demands, f or the dev elopment of ne wservices and
the improvement of existing ones. The customer’s viewpoints are gathered in two ways:
– in support of business development, through exploratory research that takes place during the
design of ne wproducts and services (through f ocus groups, qualita tive analyses leading to
evaluation of appeal, satisfaction and potentiality) as well as during the development phase
(through qualitative focus to test usability, satisfaction and functionality);
–through the customers’ perception, neg ative or positive, during the process of supplying the
service. The sa tisfaction /dissa tisfaction judgement is precious f or the compan yin terms of
improving service quality as well as maintaining customer loyalty. Perceived quality levels are
monitored during all phases of the service deliv ery process and f or all customer segments;
•special a ttention is paid to disadv antaged customers: people who fall belo wacertain income
threshold are granted a 50% reduction on the rental fee, while the hearing/speech impaired do
not pa yfor any rental fee and are granted free SMS services from mobile phones;
•TIM has dev eloped a “Ne wCRM P ortfolio” whose segments are rela ted to the socio-
demographic features of the customer and his disposition to the use of innovative services. 
This allo ws the compan yto identify actions and services, on a one-to-one relationship with the
customer ,offering products closer to the clients demands. Apersonaliz ed caring service was
also introduced. All possible channels to contact customers have now begun to be integrated
into the client rela tions activity;

Office and the Mobile Operators, including TIM, for implementing a national emergencyinformation circuit. This project, which is experimental and has a one year term, gives the 
Civil Protection Department the possibility of asking for an informative SMS to be sent
nationwide or to specific areas in order to face emergency situations, natural calamities,disasters or other tragic events that for reasons of intensity and extensity require the use of
extraordinary means and powers. These requests are subject to an ordinance, signed by the
competent Authority that specifically derogates the regulations relative to privacy in force atthe time.
All the companies of the Group conduct surveys on the level of customer satisfaction and work for
aconstant improvement in their CMR systems. In accordance with the principle of transparency
in the relationship with stakeholders, information on the criteria used for measuring the quality ofservices can be consulted on the websites dedicated to the customers.

/L50123RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS
Telecom Italia Group began collaborating with the main consumer associations in 1997, 
when it signed the General Framework Agreement with 12 among the main associations. 
Meetings aiming at safeguarding consumers’ rights continued in 2004. The Consumer 
Associations were involved in the review of the Charters of Services, contracts, and the
Conciliation Rules of the Group.In general meetings are regularly held with the Associations, to discuss the launch of new
services and technologies and the related contract conditions.
The Group takes part, as founder member in the Consumers’ Forum, which brings together
Consumer Associations, companies and research institutions, and deals with the sphere of
consumerism. Within the frame work of the Consumers’ Forum, topics of customers’ interest 
were examined with the aim to pro vide the competent Group’s departments with strategic
feedbacks.
The Group’s commitment to the area of consumers’ right was also expressed in the f ollowing
activities:
–informa tion on the possibility of benef iting from special contractual conditions for categories of
disadvantaged customers;
– in the same way as the on-line procedure adopted by TIM last July, a procedure for
reconcilia tion on-line to resolve disputes related to Internet services through out-of-court
settlements is being set up b yTI Media;
– creation, with the collaboration of the Consumer Associations, of a procedure to safeguard
users victims of hoaxes played on Internet though services such as 709, including the freepermanent disconnection of these services and the freezing of the disputed bills.

/L50123QUALITY
The management of the quality of the supply process is guaranteed by a special Group procedure,
which was set up during the previous year. This procedure regulates the selection of suppliers based
on competition amongst “qualif ied” suppliers, who have been admitted to a special Register of
Vendors. The supplier’s evaluation leads to the attribution of a vendor rating indicator, whichdetermines the admission or exclusion of the supplier from the Register of Vendors and makes it
possib le to calibrate the quality controls on supplies.
Constant commitment to quality is confirmed by the following:– the supply qualification process has been extended to the most important product categories of
to the main suppliers of some overseas subsidiary companies (TIM Hellas, TIM Brazil, EntelChile, Entel Bolivia);
– a process for the control and authorization of subcontracts was defined for the suppliers of the
companies that carry out work on the network for Telecom Italia. Telecom Italia involved thesecompanies in the process of defining evaluation criteria for the subcontractors, by listening to
their views and often taking into consideration their observations. A similar procedure, although
simplified, was implemented for the subcontractor of companies which install radio basestations for TIM;
– communication with suppliers has been made easier due both to a creation of an Internet site,
through which the suppliers have been also able to certify their regular administrative position,and to a dedicated helpdesk, dealing with the management of commercial information. About300 major suppliers have been enabled to give and visualize information relating to their ownposition in the Register of Vendor, through the access to Telecom Italia’s Internet portal (underthe dedicated purchasing section).

During 2004, about 14,000 inspections of the Group’s suppliers and sub-suppliers on a random
sample basis were carried out. The controls were planned and implemented in accordance with a
specific “risk assessment” model for the industrial sectors pertaining to purchasing. In the caseofsituations potentially at risk, determined by a new supplier or particular supply characteristics,
further controls were carried out. The results of the inspections led to the following actions:
– inclusion in/exclusion from the Register of Vendors listing the qualified suppliers of the Group;–authorization (where appropriate) to sub-contract activities to third-party companies;
– overall assessment of the supplier with regard to specific sectors of purchasing and subsequent
assessment of a Vendor Rating;
– acceptance or refusal of the supplies;– possible contractual implications, such as application of penalties.
/L50123CARE FOR ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
The ethical qualification assessment, already implemented for the qualified suppliers included 
in the Register of Vendors, has been extended to all the Telecom Italia Group’s active suppliers.
This ev aluation, based on the observance of the principles of Global Compact, guarantees a better
safeguarding for all the stakeholders involved in the purchasing process and improves, in the 
mid to long-term period, the rela tionship with the suppliers.
The contribution giv en by the Purchasing department to the “Environmental Project” was
significant. It helped in defining the “guidelines for the controls on the management of the 
waste produced b ythe Group’s companies. The guidelines are a pplied to all Business Units and
companies of the Group.
Specific audits were carried out in order to verify if the environmental normatives had beenobserv ed by the Group’s suppliers and to check the quality of the processes relating to the
application of those norms. In some cases, the audits led to requests for improvement.
Aprocedure f or the integra tion the Vendor Rating requirements has started, in order to include
the monitoring and checking of the waste produced by suppliers in the assessment process.

The following is a brief description of the main regulatory issues adopted by the competent
authorities in 2004.
Information service on subscribers “12”
When the Code of Electronic Communication came into force, sanctioning the non-applicability 
of the ob ligations to provide Universal Service for the subscriber information service “12”,
Telecom Italia published the new conditions of its service with effect on November 1, 2003,
January 1, 2004 and July 1, 2004.

(AGCOM) provided for the assignment by the Communication Ministry of the rights to use
subscriber inf orma tion n umbers (12xy) to telecommunica tion opera tors tha trequest it. 
The service will come into eff ect on Jul y1, 2005.
Universal Service 2002
With Resolution No. 2/04/CIR da ted April 8, 2004, AGCOM launched a public consultation
regarding the proposal for a resolution concerning the applicability of the mechanism to
distribute and to ev aluate the net cost f or the y ear 2002. AGCOM calcula tes a net cost equal

the offer, substantially confirming the proposal put forward by Telecom Italia which provides 
for the reduction of interconnection costs compared to last year. This is in line with the networkcap system introduced by the same Authority.
Price cap
In the framework of the revision of prices of retail services subject to price cap regulations,
applying from Jan uary 1, 2004, the price of connection f ee for residential clients was increased by
25% (from Euro 100 to 125), the price of line transf er was increased b y20% (from Euro 50 to 60)

The main accounting principles used to determine the economic values for Interbusiness 
services are described below. These accounting principles have been verified by the auditors 
since 1996.In2004, this audit was performed by Reconta Ernst & Young SpA.
•
Revenues: are stated at market prices for services offered in competition and at rates
established by law for regulated services and recorded on accrual basis. In the case of services
that imply the use of retail dedicated access lines, the revenues also include the income from
leasing such lines (valued on the basis of the rates defined in the related resolutions), with theconsequent accounting of the same amount among costs.
•
Direct costs:
– network utilization costs include the cost to use the regulated carrier services (dedicated

they are therefore valued, respectively, using the rates established by the law and the ratesapplied to all third-party customers, the same as occurs in the cost structure of other carriers
in the sector;
–labor costs represent the cost of personnel who w orked to provide such services; the cost
includes salary and wages, social security costs, provisions for employee termination
indemnities and other sundry costs recorded on the basis of the n umber of people w orking in
the a ppropriate structures. Such costs are determined according to accounting standards;
– other direct costs refer to other typologies of direct costs (marketing, connection fee,
opera tions and maintenance, etc .) and indirect costs (costs of departments supporting the
operating functions) valued using unambiguous cost accounting standards and applying
specific allocation methods.

Depr eciation of fixed assets directly employed in providing the services in question is
determined on the basis of the lif ecycle of the f ixed assets of Telecom Italia.
The economic results of the interbusiness services are reported as follows:

The results for 2004 show an operating result of euro 5,926 thousand compared to a loss of 
Euro 764 thousand in 2003. Such result is due to the combined effect of the reduction inrevenues that was more than offset by the reduction in costs. The impact on revenues (– 18.7%)
is mainly on account of a decline in customers who switched to other alternative offers. 
The reduction of resources absorbed by the service is due to a decline in the clientele and, insome cases, a reduction in the unit cost; in total, theref ore, costs decreased by 37.3%.
Depreciation shows a reduction of 5.9%.

The data refers to waste recorded in compliance with Legislative Decree No. 22 of February 5, 1997.
Up until 30thof March each year there could be a small adjustment of the situation described on
31stDecember due to the fact that the source of the data is the registers of acquisition and
disposal of waste and is only confirmed with the verification of the real weight at the disposal
plant. That information is supplied to the waste producer within three months of consignment and
this justifies the possibility of an adjustment of these figures.
Compared to 2002, there was a reduction in the quantity of waste genera ted b yTelecom Italia, while
an increase of 12.64% was registered compared to 2003. This increase is due both to the replacement
of the wooden telephone poles, in compliance with the Agreement Program with the Ministry of theEnvironment, the Ministry of Production Activities, the Conference of State and the Regions, and the
extra clearing activities of the na tionwide telephone exchanges. The percentage of the recovered and
recycled waste is higher than 88%, with an increase of 2.65% compared to the previous year.
Compared to 2002, the quantity of dangerous waste was more than 61% lower, while an increase
of 8.65% was registered compared to 2003. This increase is due to a clearing of diesel oilcontaminated ground (equivalent to 403,080 Kilograms) as a result of a tank leakage.

/L50123EMISSIONS
Atmospheric emissions
As far as Telecom Italia Group’s industrial activity is concerned, the most typical and significant
emissions in terms of quantity are carbon dioxide (CO 2)emissions derived from “indirect”
emission, due to the purchase of energy from national suppliers (Enel and other companies) and
fuel consumption for heating and transportation purposes CO 2,is a typical product of combustion
and, as such, is produced almost exclusively by thermoelectric systems.
During the last year, the decrease of CO 2emissions continued thanks to a reduction in the
consumption of electrical energy and an increase in the use of gas (methane) instead of oil-fired energy
for heating, together with a corporate fleet reduction and an increase in the use of green energy.
CO2emissions have been calculated according to the instructions contained in the guidelines
published by UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and others recommended by ETNO
(European Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association) within the framework of the“Clima te Change” project.
The amount of CO
2produced by combustion is calculated by applying specific emissions factors
to the consumption of the v arious kinds of fuel (1).
In 2004, the data relating to the emissions produced by the use of electrical energy was taken
from the parameters pub lished by Enel in the year 2004 (2003 Environmental Report).

were: 4.03 t of CO 2/tep f or coal and derivatives; 3.27 for oil products; 2.35 for natural gas.
These factors were replaced with the ones recommended in the 1996 Guidelines published by IPCC (International Panel on Climate
Change) for the national inventory of greenhouse gases and have already been used for the second national communication on emissions:fuel oil: 3.24 t of CO
2/tep; orimulsion: 3.38; diesel fuel: 3.10; natural gas: 2.35; coal: 4.02; lignite: 4.24; cokery gas: 2.00.
Each one of the above is then multiplied by a correcting coefficient which takes into account the typical fraction of unburnt carbon(solid fuel: 0.980; liquid fuel: 0.990; gas fuel: 0.995).As in the past, the resulting figure regards burnt carbon – which, however, as just mentioned, is now assumed to be less than 100%–as being completely oxidized to CO

TIM carries out the constant monitoring of the electromagnetic emissions in full observance of
the standards set forth by the current law.
This monitoring activity is carried out within the corporation itself through a procedure that
ensures the conformity to current limits during the installation of the site and throughout the
period of its activity.
TIM likewise fully collaborated in the realization of the National Monitoring Network carried out
by the Ministry of Communications with the help of the Ugo Bordoni Foundation. This activityaims to allow the control and supervision of the company systems and promote their periodicalmonitoring. The control of the systems is pursued through the Regional Offices for the Protection
of the Environment (ARPA), which cooperates with the Ministry of Communications in the
realization of the project through special protocols.
In 2004, the monitoring of TIM’s sites begun in accordance with the agreement contained in the
Legambiente/TIM Protocol.
The purpose of the protocol signed in 2003 is to guarentee and give assurance in the
environmental field and to give the Legambiente technicians full support in verifying the safety of
the base radio sta tions, particularl yconcerning electromagnetic emissions.
In most cases, TIM relies on external companies to carry out these measurements, whereas, in
others, it directl ydeleg ates the responsibility of measuring emissions to the territorial
representa tives of the Ministry of the Environment and the ARPA (Regional Offices for the
Protection of the Environment), especially when specific environmental situations are involved
(regional la ws, local regula tions, and so on).
Even in the absence of any change to its installations, TIM carries out the measurements of
electromagnetic emissions in agreement with the landowners and/or local authorities or in
compliance with UNI EN ISO 14001 or UNI EN ISO 9001 certif ications, f or the networks
nationwide.
Where it is necessary, modification of the radiant position (tilting) in order to optimize the signal
strength is carried out. Surveys of planimetries of radio base stations and of radiant systems areadded to the network database and used in order to survey and optimize the electromagnetic
emissions parameters.
Last year a total of 2,957 controls were carried out.
Specif
ic projects
– APOGEO Project
The APOGEO (Antennas Procedures On Geographic Enhanced Orientation) procedure aims to
calculate radioelectric parameters relating to the three-dimensional positioning of GSM andUMTS transmitters.
The calcula tion is made on the basis of georef erred topo graphic surveys made through the GPS
satellite system, the precision of which is increased by using the differential correction
technique allowed for by GEOTIM (network of permanent GPS reference stations). The
application consists in positioning the “lobe of radiation” of the transmitter accurately, and, atthe same time, verifying its electromagnetic compatibility.
Radioelectric parameters have to be measured accurately to optimize the mobile planning
process and reduce interf erence on TIM netw orks. Furthermore, the accuracy of the da ta
measured is considered essential for evaluating the exclusion zones (TIM can certify its own
installa tion da ta by guaranteeing transparency and respect for current laws) with the aim of
respecting and saf eguarding the environment.
In 2004, 25 complete equipment kits w ere acquired and given to regional network divisions.
The kit consists of a GPS satellite receiver and an integrated laser for topographical surveys.

The “Guardian” tool calculates the exclusion zones relating to the areas where base radio
stations are located and guarantees that the statutory limits are respected. When so applied,
the tool plays a double-role depending on compatibility:•to optimize the locationing of the stations and the positioning of transmitters in relation to
the specific context (houses, streets, meeting-places);
• to provide objective data for the required comparisons (ARPA, population).
The improvement of the TIMPLAN tool used for the network planning contributed to the
rational Development of the UMTS and EDGE systems.
The rational use of the radio frequencies (that can be guaranteed only by appropriate
instruments) is useful for the operator and at the same time, the amount of electromagneticenergy released into the environment due to networks and services is reduced.
The new procedures for the definition of the electromagnetic propagation models, which was
developed during the y ear,gaverise to guidelines and training courses for network planners.
The inno vative solutions adopted to model the radio propagation characteristics, gave rise to
training courses for the system-planning staff.
These solutions ha vebeen tailored to the f ollowing radio planning issues:
•frequency-code assignement f or mixed GSM-UMTS radio access
•optimiza tion of the UMTS radio parameters
•management of the EDGE carriers within the frequency planning process.
In conclusion, the planning of the radio access netw ork with the use of TIMPLAN tool, in
addition to the impro ved SW process and the procedures dev eloped both during 2004 and the
previous y ears, contribute to the correct w orking of the mobile communications network of
second and third generation, reducing, at the same time, the interference and consequently thesuperfluous power emission.
–STEREOSP
ACE
StereoSpace software makes it possible to visualize twin images, acquired digitally and
appropriately oriented (SV Master) stereoscopically on a computer screen, and to carry outmeasurements, mak ecomparison and upda tes, with the same precision as that produced using
classic measuring tools.
StereoSpace contains digital images of areas reg arded as being of stra tegic importance to TIM.
These images are of key importance not only because they are aerial photographs with an
adequa te amount of resolution, but especially because they are georeferred. The tool makes it
possib le to identify the exact position of the transmission installa tions, thus pro viding accura te
data for frequency planning and for calculating and seeing the exclusion zones on screen.
In 2004, the sites were increased by 7 units bringing the total to 23.With regard to the mobile phones marketed through its sales channels, TIM makes a selection
based on the level of technical innovation and the measurements of the Standard Absorption
Rate (SAR) to guarantee reduced electromagnetic emissions lev els.

The Environmental Management Systems (EMS) represents the operating instrument to plan,
implement and manage the production and support processes. The EMS also identifies action
plans for prevention and potential improvement, guaranteeing at the same time the conformity toexisting legal requirements.
Some of the Group’s companies and departments have already obtained both the 
UNI EN ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 certifications. The actual target is gradually to extend the
implementation of the EMS to the whole Group, through a special project studied and
coordinated by the Corporate Department. This plan aims to harmonize the existing EMS andprovide guidelines for the creation of new ones.
The fundamental objectives of the Management Systems are the following:
• to optimize the use of energy sources, of materials and products;
• to improve waste management by making efforts to re-utilize and re-cycle used materials and
residues from processes;
• to minimize the negative impact and maximize the positive impact on the environment due to
the dissemination of hi-tech telecommunication services;
• to adopt procurement policies which are sensitive to environmental problems, by involving
suppliers;
• to improve the indicators of effectiveness and efficiency relating to corporate processes;• to promote the cultural propagation of a correct approach to environmental issues;
• to guarantee the commitment to a constant improvement of the environmental performances
as a whole, through a periodical evaluation of the actual situation and an operative controlprocedure which aims to make the management system itself more efficient and effective.
Up to the present time, a tGroup level, remarkable improvements have been made in the spreading
of the adoption of the En vironmental Management Systems and obtaining certifications for them.
In 2004, the Wireline Network, which completed the ISO 14001 certification project for all its
operative units in June 2003, successfully passed two audits in the North-East and South areascarried out by the Certification Entity. During the audits, 4 building yards were checked to verifythe observance with environmental requirements; these areas were managed by externalcompanies that undertake, on contract, enlargement and modernization work of the TLC network.The Management System’s control has always been present to guarantee compliance withcertifications.
TILAB and Olivetti I-Jet, which obtained the ISO 14001 certification in 2001, saw the certification
for the year 2004 reconfirmed.
In March 2004, Elettra TLC completed the process of planning and adoption of the EMS and
obtained the certif ication f or the whole compan y.
In July 2004, TI Sparkle began the process of EMS planning, taking the necessary steps to obtain
the certification, expected in December 2005. At the present time, TI Sparkle has already drawn up
and pub lished its o wn en vironmental policy and also settled all the actions which need to be taken.
During the year 2004, TIM completed the project to extend the integrated Environmental
Management System, developed in compliance with the UNI EN ISO 9001 and UNI EN ISO 14001standards f or all the premises of the nationwide Network.
The Environment Management System is related to the activities of “Planning, Realization, andSuperintendence of the nationwide network of mobile telecommunication”.

The monitoring and checking activities of the electromagnetic emissions continued throughprecise programmes of measurement and optimization.
The communication activity with the external local communities, in particular with Public
Administrations and Institutions continued. Environmental communication programmes weredeveloped for employees with the aim to promote information and awareness on these subject
matters to all employees.
The checking and monitoring of activities of environmental efficiency are part of the
Environmental Management System process and are carried out with dedicated instruments.
Local databases were created to monitor the trend of the main environmental indicators.
Periodical reports are made to be distributed and discussed afterwards with managers.The System process includes inspections (carried out both by internal staff of the company and
external staff of a CSQ - IMQ certified organization) to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of
the en vironmental processes perf ormed b ythe compan y.
THE ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
The project consists of 10 w orking groups and stretches o ver a 3 y ear period, from 2004
to 2006. The project objectives are mainly related to the implementation, harmonization
and certification of the Environmental Management Systems, the development of a com-
puteriz ed system to opera te the en vironmental da ta, training and information programs,
the analyses of the life cycle of products and services, control of the environmental
aspects that present risk factors.Particular relevance is given to computerized waste management, prevention of ground
pollution, clearing of the materials containing asbestos, and monitoring of both acoustic
emissions and electromagnetic fields.
/L50123ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
In 2004, projects managed b yTelecom Italia with a positive environmental impact can be
summed up as follows:
Adaptive transmitters
Advanced prototype solutions have been developed for mobile communication (also through
cooperation with the constructors) both for adaptive transmitter systems and remote-controlled
transmitters.•adaptability makes it possible to reduce the emissions by just using the power and directions
necessary for communication, avoiding, at the same time, the release of unnecessary energy
into the environment;
•transmitter remote controlling makes it possible to disengage the transmitter from the location
of the related control systems (base station) with obvious advantages at infrastructure level
(simplifying building requirements and reducing the visual impact on the environment).
Measurements and safety of the second- and third-generation (2G/3G) radio systems

package;
– network solutions and the apparatus needed in order to guarantee safety for communications
and rela ted computer systems.
Crisis Management
The Group has set up a system to deal with an ycritical situa tions that might impact negatively 
on business, caused by, for example, natural disasters, hacking or other criminal activities in Italy
or abroad. The system, f ormaliz ed with a Group procedure signed b ythe Chairman, is based on
the following bodies:
–the Crisis Management Board, including representatives of the Group’s top management, 
with strategic and coordinating tasks;
– the Crisis Management Board’s Secretary, in charge of generally managing the system and
updating it;
– the Operational Crisis Teams, that carry out the Board’s strategic orders in the field;
– the Incident and Crisis Center, which monitors all signals that might be premonitory of critical
situa tions and channels inf orma tion flows required by top-management in order to optimize
decision making. The Incident and Crisis Center is also the contact and assistance point f or all
company structures and single employees having specific security needs in connection with
possib le incidents or transf ers in f oreign countries that are potentially risky.
CRSA (Control & Risk Self Assessment)
The opera tivedeplo yment phase of the project continued, providing the Group with a method 
of structured self-ev aluation of risks made b ythe management, in rela tion to def ined compan y
objectives. This methodology has been integrated within the Group’s planning process. 
Aweb-based a pplication has been set up to support the main phases of the CRSA process:

Wi-Fi (W ireless Fidelit y)
The service provides high-speed wireless connection to Internet or company Intranets from
public places where it has been installed (hot spots) using laptop computers or palmtops. During
2004 the home page that appears automatically to users who access services in the hot spots was
completely renewed both in structure and content, making it simpler and more comfortable toenter and remain in Wi-Fi areas. In the new portal pre-paid Wi-Fi cards may be bought on-line inany denomination.Thanks to crea ting man ynew hot spots and to several new roaming contracts, Telecom Italia has
one of the largest Wi-Fi networks in the world.
“Loquendo” platform
This is an advanced interactive voice system that allows the user to access information and
transactional data with a simple telephone call. The platform has undergone restructuring in order
to impro ve voice recognition technology so as to provide services that are even more advanced
and of increasingly high quality. The platform supports 15 languages and can recognize 50,000
words; it can use voice prints as a biometric feature to verify a person’s identity.
There are v arious possible applications also for the business sector, such as, for example,
automation of Call Centers, introducing voice services for Customer Relationship Management
applications, creating infomobile services, and dialogue services for company Intranet systems.

visually-impaired and the elderly to use all the functions on mobile phones by themselves thanksto an electronic voice that reads the display screen and guides the user to the various options
offered on the menu.
The Talks software uses the “ETI Eloquence” program, the same one used by other programs that read the screen on personal computers; it is very popular with blind people.
EDGE and UMTS
The update of the GSM platform that supports EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution)
was completed in order to provide access to the advantages of third-generation (3G) services 
to a wider range of clients, including people living in remote areas; this helped to reduce 
the digital divide.Meanwhile, planning and realization of the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)
network, which guarantees coverage of regional capitals as per contractual obbligations stipulated
in their licenses, proceeded in several other cities and localities of interest.In 2004 TIM launched its commercial TIM T urbo service; thanks to integration with EDGE and
UMTS it provides broad-band services with significantly better data transmission speed than
GPRS ,similar to UMTS speed.
In order to support the ne wbroad-band 3G services while ensuring high-quality levels, the 
Core Network IP platform, which was already used by most of the technologies, has been
updated.

65 Shareholders/L50123DEVELOPMENT
During 2004 development activities were characterized by the special attention given to the
talent enhancement .
Inthis perspective several initiatives were launched in the various Business Units to implement
the Group Professional System, with projects for the purpose of assessing employees’
competence portfolio (specialized knowledge and personal ability).
In more detail, during the year a census was made of specialized knowledge for around 60,000
people working in the various Business Units, using a common model that allows the company to estimate the patrimonial value of the know-how present in the Group, to evaluate the bestallocation of the resources in terms of business needs and to set up measures of retention 
and development of core competences.
As regard to talent enhancement within the larger framework of the annual process 
to identify Key People in the Group, during 2004 a 
Knowledge Review study was carried out
according to a common model in all the Business Units. This study identified resources within 
the various company realities who, due to their competences, represent professional 
reference points.
In keeping with a policy of contin ual reinf orcement, dissemina tion and internaliza tion of the
System of Group Values, several initiatives were carried out by the Business Units during the year
to develop and increase management competences, at all levels, on the theme of employee
enhancement .
Another specific course of action followed in 2004 was harmonizing policies and systems of
developing resources at international level in the v arious companies of the Group abroad. 
In this frame work there were numerous initiatives to promulgate the development procedures
alread yinuse in the Business Units in Ital y,for example by extending the experiences of the
Development Center and the Assessment Center to the management of the companies in 
Latin America.
The Internal Development, Training and Communication activities during 2004 were 
orientated towards the logic of the reinforcement of the of Professional Families’ system and
culture .
Several surveys (questionnaires and focus groups) were carried out to constantly monitor
perception and motivation levels in the various Professional Families; get-togethers and
conventions were organized to gather resources from various professional areas; professional
families fostered job-rotation following a logic of richer and larger professional development.
Recruiting
In 2004 a program was implemented to recruit, screen and place a considerable number of 
high-potential new graduates, mainly in engineering and finance.
This project, which began in May, underlined the importance of transferring the Group culture
following a common path of recruitment, screening, placement, training and use of tools forprofessional development. In coherence with the Industrial Plan and the Professional Families’orientation, the project was based on the data on the Group’s recruitment requirements as toquality and quantity.

/L50123TRAINING
During 2004 there were around 1.9 million hours of training activities in Telecom Italia Group
(classroom, on-line, training on the job for Italian personnel) and around 33 million euro for 
basic training costs (excluding the labor costs and logistic expenses). 
These activities, largely carried out by Telecom Italia Learning Services, regarded mainly the
following areas:
Overall Group Projects
• Completion of the managerial training program for executives aiming at change management
in accordance with the managerial model drawn up for the Group (“Tools for Change”) and the“Objective: Image” project for all executives in the Group, to foster and spread an
organizational culture that defends and reinforces the company image.
• Realization of 5 editions of the placement-training program for new graduates in Telecom Italia
Group to acquaint them all with identical knowledge of the organization and the Group’s values
and teach them the basic “tools of the trade”.
• A Learning Tour was held in the USA for 15 managers from various Business Units, with a full
immersion in top American corporate realities on the subject of “Business Innovation”.
• The training programs for the Professional Families Human Resources and Finance,
Administra tion and Control, and the launch of the training pro gram f or prof essional Buyers
(Purchasing Professional Family) were concluded.
Training for the Business Units
Training in the Business Units was mostly to develop competences needed to run the 
separate businesses.
Specifically:
• In Wireline training projects in client relations and role adjustment for front-end personnel
continued (i.e. the Evolution Project for SAT , Coaching Project, Minerva Project) as well astraining projects for sales personnel to acquire expertise at high level both in Telecom Italia
products, services and offers and in client relationships (i.e. the Negotiation Project, Projects
for Organizational Development of Sales to Business Clients, General Management of PublicTelephony Clients and General Management of Residential Clients). On the emergent topic of
convergence between electronic communication and television services from a technical and
regulatory angle (national and European Community regulations on acquiring and defendingintellectual property rights to new platforms and in the television sector) the first training
sessions mainly directed to managers and professionals in Business Regulations and Legal
Department were held. These training sessions also saw the participation of resources fromMarketing and Network.
• In TIM the main initiatives have been in “multinationality” to foster integration and networking
between TIM Italia and the foreign companies (i.e. First International Business Championship -TIM CUP), “People enhancement” with a training plan for executives and key middle managers
in charge of structures for furthering knowledge and modalities of managing the PerformanceManagement process and “Orientation toward the Client” (i.e. the training project involvingTIM key people and executives from corporate TIM clients).

In 2004 the management of interventions on fixed-compensation was consolidated. 
The interventions are ever more targeted to link it directly with the level of strategic importanceand roles filled.
The v ariab le compensa tion element in compensa tion packages was increasingl y-tightl ylinked to
compan y/individual perf ormance. In this respect, formalized systems took on particular
significance; in 2004 we saw a consolidation of the systems already in place (MBO Managerial
Incentiv es and Long Term Incentiv ePlan) as w ell as the introduction of a new formal incentive
plan – named P erformance Bonus Program (PBP) – destined at resources holding relevant
business positions which have more of a professional than a managerial content.
In a Group perspective, the commitment to harmonize policies on benefits continued;
furthermore, during 2004 the number of people receiving some type of benefits increased. This was to v alorize the overall compensation package.

65 Shareholders/L50123WORK AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN LATIN AMERICA
The following shows the main actions taken by the Group in Latin American countries to
implement the Principles of the Global Compact regarding human rights and safeguards 
for work.
Human Rights
At TIM Peru, as of November 2003 a document called “Internal Manual of Labor” was introduced
which defines clear rules for rights and obbligations of Company employees. 
This document is given out at the moment of employment, listing the person’s rights regarding: 
respect for ideas/personal contributions, privacy, health and safety, equal opportunities,facilities/aids for disabled personnel.Human Resources’ administration and welfare departments ensure the observance and respect 
of the rules.
In the Company Code of Ethics and yet another document called “TIM Peru Policy for 
Conduct”, the principle of mutual respect between workers without discrimination on the basis of race, religion or nationality is cited. This principle is strictly applied also when recruiting
personnel.
TIM P eru, through its activities in the struggle ag ainst child poverty, was considered by UNICEF
to be a “Friendly UNICEF Enterprise”.
In TIM Brazil, where there are specific regulations to guard against discrimination on the 
basis of race, religion and gender, both in the Federal Constitution (which respects the principles
of the Interna tional Labour Or ganiza tion and the Universal Declaration of Rights for Man) and in
national legislation, it was not deemed necessary to introduce a specific policy on the subject; 
it was left to Human Resources to monitor the fundamental processes relating to humanresources (recruitment, management and dev elopment) making use of its own holding and
territorial or ganizations. The first Company Code of Ethics is being distributed to employees; 
it cites the general principles of the Group and supplements them according to specif ic local
requirements.
In Chile the government has set up a special body to monitor compliance with guidelines to
safeguard relationships between companies and workers. Entel Chile fully respects these
regulations.
At Entel Bolivia, the Collective Labor Contract in force between the parties stipulates respect 
for dignity and human rights of employees and fosters equal opportunities for men and women; itespecially promotes female participation in company activities.
Safeguards for Labor
On the subject of freedom to belong to associations, in Group companies in Latin America 
specific policies that refer to and regulate in detail the general rules of each country are usually
not formalized.The collective contracts of all the operative companies in TIM Brazil were renewed in 2004, with
new salaries and contracts (for example fixed-term contracts).
Entel Bolivia actively cooperates with the Unions to guarantee freedom to associate in conformitywith local labor laws. The country’s constitution stipulates that no-one may be forced to performany job without proper remuneration and Entel Bolivia monitors observance of this provision.In Entel Chile there are professional continuing-education programs about labor law for unionmembers; relevant regulations are published on the company Intranet.

65 ShareholdersRegarding union representation the following data has been collected:
– TIM Brazil: about 6% of workers are members of collective union organizations; results of
negotiations affect the entire employee base, including non members;
– TIM Peru: membership is not high given the traditional weakness of union associations in this
country;
– Entel Bolivia: 48% of workers are members of union associations;
– Entel Chile: 39% of personnel are members of union associations and 59% of them benefit from
results of negotiations.
When there are company reorganizations, the company’s obligations to the workers and union
representatives differ from one country to another:
– TIM Brazil: there are no particular formalities to observe with workers and union
representatives; the only duties are towards institutional bodies such as ANATEL (regulatory)and C ADE (anti-trust);
– TIM Peru: although there are no formalities at legislative level, specific measures to involve
emplo yees and listen to them have been adopted, such as open forums, focus groups, meetings
to talk directly to top management, etc.;
– Entel Bolivia: developed a series of tools to prevent possible conflicts by means of wide-spread
informa tion about compan yplans and policies.
These tools are:
• Foro Estratégico (Strategic Forum): it meets bi-monthly to discuss industrial policies and

/L50123INTRODUCTION
The Company’s system of corporate governance is based on the central role of the Board of
Directors, the complete transparency of operational decisions, both internal and in relation to themarket, efficient and effective internal controls and rigorous rules governing conflicts of interest.The backbone of the system consists of a series of codes, rules and procedures.In 2004 these documents were carefully reviewed and, where necessary, updated in response to
legislative and regulatory developments and changes in international best practices and the
Company’s operations. Furthermore, some amendments and additions were made to the bylaws,partly to take account of the changes in company law introduced by the “Vietti reform”.
This section describes the innovations concerning Telecom Italia’s system of corporate
governance and how it operated during the year; the section is an excerpt from the correspondingsection of the “Report on operations” of the Annual Report 2004, to which reference is made for
the complete text (a vailable, as all the other corporate governance documents mentioned herein
–principles, codes procedures, charts – on the website: www.telecomitalia.it/Investors, sections
“governance”  and “shareholders”).
/L50123BOARD OF DIRECTORS
/L50123Role and tasks
The Board of Directors has the po wer (and the duty) to lead the Compan yand pursue the
primary objectiv eof creating value for its shareholders. To that end the Self-Regulatory Code
reserv es sev eral especiall yimportant tasks exclusively to the Board, including those of:
(i) examining and approving strategic, business and financial plans;
(ii) reviewing and approving the annual budget;
(iii) examining and approving transactions – including investments and disinvestments – with a
substantial impact on the Company’s activity in view of their nature, strategic importance or
size;
(iv) the adequacy of the general organizational and administrative structure of the Company and
the Group;

consideration of the planned merger between Telecom Italia and Tim, a revised version of thecalendar was released in December 2004.
/L50123Appointment of directors
The bylaws require the members of the Board of Directors to be elected using the slate system.
This ensures an adequate representation on the Board of persons not representing the
shareholders commanding a majority of votes in shareholders’ meetings since they are drawnfrom slates presented by minority shareholders (in fact slates may be presented by shareholders
who, individually or together with others, hold at least 1% of the voting capital).
The present Board was appointed by the shareholders’ meeting held on 6 May 2004, on the basis
of two slates: one presented by the majority shareholder, Olimpia S.p.A., and the other by a group
of Italian institutional investors.The slates were accompanied by the profiles of the individual candidates to enable shareholders
to evaluate their personal and professional qualifications. Also the curricula submitted when the
slates were presented are on the Company’s website.
/L50123Composition of the Board
Telecom Italia’s b ylawsprovide f or the Board of Directors to ha ve not less than 7 and not more
than 23 members. The shareholders’ meeting of 6 Ma y2004 fixed the number of directors at 19
and established that they would remain in office until the date of the approval of the 2006
financial sta tements.
TheBoard is made up of the f ollowing directors:

65 Shareholders/L50123Independent directors
The Company has adopted criteria conforming with international best practice and the Italian
corporate governance code, known as the Preda Code, to qualify directors as “independent”.Inthe light of the declarations submitted and the annual assessment carried out by the Board
of Directors, 10 of the 19 directors qualify as independent, namely: Paolo Baratta, John Robert
Sotheby Boas, Domenico De Sole, Francesco Denozza, Luigi Fausti, Guido Ferrarini, Jean PaulFitoussi, Marco Onado, Pasquale Pistorio and Luigi Roth. The directors in question:
(i) neither have nor have recently had, directly, indirectly or on behalf of third parties, business
relationships of a significance able to influence their autonomous judgement with theCompany, its subsidiaries, the executive directors or the shareholder or group of
shareholders who control the Company;
(ii) do not hold, directly, indirectly or on behalf of third parties, equity interests allowing them to
control the Company or exercise a significant influence over it;
(iii) do not participate in shareholders’ agreements to control the Company or containing clauses
regarding the composition of the Board of Directors or its decisions. This requirement is
interpreted broadly, with an eye to “substantial” independence. Accordingly, “participation inshareholders’ agreements” precludes independence when a director has significant
relationships with the na tural or legal persons that are parties thereto;
(iv) are not close relatives of executive directors of the Company or of persons in the situations
indica ted abo ve.
During the y ear the Board of Directors of Telecom Italia S.p.A. decided it was desirable to appoint
aLead Independent Director ,with the aim of further enhancing the role of the independent
directors.
Professor Guido Ferrarini, Chairman of the Internal Control and Corporate GovernanceCommittee, was chosen to be the Lead Independent Director .The position is intended to pro vide
apoint of ref erence and coordina tion f or the needs and contributions of the independent
directors and ensure they can decide with the greatest possible autonomy with respect to the
management. Among other things, the Lead Independent Director is authorized to call, at his owninitia tive or at the request of other directors, special meetings of the independent directors
(Independent Directors’ Executive Sessions) to discuss issues related to the working of the Boardor operational activity (with the possibility of requesting the participation of members of the
management).One such Independent Directors’ Executive Session was held before the meeting of the Board
called on 7 December 2004 to launch the plan for the merger of Tim into Telecom Italia. The
meeting was devoted to examining the terms and conditions of the transaction. The independent
directors were assisted by Goldman Sachs, the advisor selected directly by the Internal Control
and Corporate Governance Committee (see below).
/L50123Executive directors
The authority to grant delegated powers to directors and revoke such mandates is reserved to the
Board of Directors, which also establishes their limits, the manner in which they may be exercised
and the intervals at which persons with delegated powers must report on their activity. The
authority to determine the duties and po wers of the general managers is also reserv ed to the
Board of Directors.
On 6 Ma y2004, in the first meeting following its renewal, the Board of Directors appointed Marco
Tronchetti Pro vera as Chairman, Carlo Orazio Buora and Riccardo Ruggiero as Managing Directors,
and Gilberto Benetton as Deputy Chairman.
Looking beyond the system of powers delegated to the executive directors, it is worth noting that
in practice decisions concerning transactions of particular signif icance are tak en bythe Board,
even though the ytheoreticall yfall within the scope of the deleg ated po wers. In fact, deleg ation
does not mean the assignment of exclusive powers but is rather the solution adopted by Telecom
Italia to ensure, in terms of the Board’s or ganiza tion, a high degree of opera tional flexibility, both
within the Compan yand in rela tion to third parties.

(i) separation of roles in the performance of the principal activities involved in each operating
process;
(ii) traceability and constant visibility of decisions;

Director RiccardoRuggier ois an
exception in this respect
since , prior to his being
co-opted to the Board
of Dir ector s,as General
Manager he was among
the beneficiaries of astock-option plan.The Board of Directors is responsible for the internal control system. It lays down the guidelines
for the system and verifies that it is adequate and works effectively, making sure that the maincorporate risks are appropriately identified and managed. To this end the Board uses the Internal
Control and Corporate Governance Committee and a suitably independent person endowed with
sufficient resources to perform the internal control function.Itis the Chairman of the Board who determines the mechanisms of the system and the manner in
which it is to be implemented under the guidelines established by the Board; he is also
responsible for ensuring the system’s overall adequacy, its effectiveness and its adaptation tochanges in operating conditions and the legislative and regulatory framework. 
The basic functions of the person responsible for internal control are to verify the adequacy and
effectiveness of the system and, where anomalies are found, to recommend the necessary
remedies. The Board has appointed the Company’s internal auditor (Telecom Italia Audit), in the
person of the director assigned to the task, to be responsible for its internal control system. Thiscompany reports on its activity to the Board of Directors, the Internal Control and Corporate
Governance Committee and the Board of Auditors.
Any maintenance work on the internal control system is performed by the competent sectors ofthe Company or Group companies. The efficient operation of the system is promoted by the
appointment of managers of particular standing and authority within the organization as “persons
responsib le for implementa tion” (currentl ythe head of the Group’s Human Resources and the
head of the Wireline Business Unit).
Internal auditing has been entrusted to the above-mentioned consortium company Telecom Italia
Audit, in which Tim and TI Media also hold equity interests. The solution adopted maximiz es the
independence of the internal audit function with respect to Telecom Italia’s corporate structures.
The Company’s internal control system is completed by the so-called 231 Organizational Model,
which goes be yond the mere a pplica tion of the provisions of Legislative Decree 231/2001, since it
provides a paradigm for the conduct of all those who act in the Company’s name and on its
behalf. More specifically, the model comprises “principles for dealings with governmental bodies”(elabora ted as a set of rules for relations with representatives of such bodies) and “internal
control checklists” listing the main stages of ev ery process, the offences that may be committed
in relation to individual processes, and the control activities to prevent the related risks from
arising.The or ganizational model is reviewed periodically in the light of experience in its application and
changes to the law subsequent to the initial framework created by Legislative Decree 231/2001.
Monitoring of the functioning and compliance with the model is performed by a Supervisory Panelmade up of a member of the Board of Auditors (Ferdinando Superti Furga, chairman), an
independent director on the Internal Control and Corporate Governance Committee (Guido
Ferrarini) and the person responsible for the internal control system. This ensures that themembers of the P anel embod yall the professional skills involved in the control of the Company’s
operations. The membership, term of office and powers of the present Panel were confirmed by
the Board of Directors in their meeting on 6 May 2004.The Supervisory P anel will encourage the Board of Directors to adapt the model as needed to
changes in the legislative and regulatory framework, the nature of the Company’s business
activities and the ways they are conducted. It reports to the Board of Directors, the InternalControl and Corpora te Governance Committee and the Board of Auditors on the checks performed
and their results.
The shareholders’ meeting of 6 May 2004 resolved that the member of the Board of Auditorsserving on the Supervisory P anel should be paid a gross annual fee of
/Euro.18620,000, the same as tha t
assigned by the Board of Directors to the member of the Internal Control and Corporate
Governance Committee serving on the Panel.Lastly, it should be noted that a special unit has been created within Telecom Italia Audit toprovide operational support to the Supervisory Panels of Group companies by handling reports ofviolations of the organizational model and conducting compliance audits on the basis of the datareceived by way of the information flows that have been put in place.

Ferdinando Superti Furga (chairman), Salvatore Spiniello and Gianfranco Zanda (elected from the
slate presented by Olimpia) and Rosalba Casiraghi and Paolo Golia (elected from the slatepresented by institutional investors).The Board of Statutory Auditors plays a key role in the Company’s system of corporategovernance. In addition to the meetings of the Board of Statutory Auditors (14 in the year, someof which w ere held jointl ywith the Internal Control and Corpora te Go vernance Committee), the
auditors participa ted in the tw elvemeetings of the Board of Directors, so tha tcontacts betw een

65 ShareholdersIn view of the requirement that the Audit Committee approve all the services the auditing firm
(and associated persons) supply to the issuer and its directly and indirectly controlledsubsidiaries, the Company has adopted a Group Procedure for the Appointment of Auditors.
In particular, this provides on a general basis for the centralized control of relations with auditing
firms to prevent engagements for non-audit services being granted that fail to comply with theapplicable Italian or US law and that ultimately could undermine auditor independence. The
procedure regulates the engagement of auditing firms and persons associated with them on a
continuous basis, distinguishing between engagements that must be individually authorized inadvance by the Audit Committee and those falling within categories subject to a generic
authorization. The procedure significantly restricts the power of the Board of Directors (and the
management) while enhancing the control function performed by the Company’s Board of
Statutory Auditors.
The Company has also adopted the principle of employing the same auditing firm throughout theGroup; in fact the appointment of other firms must be agreed in advance with the parent
company following a reasoned request on which Telecom Italia’s Board of Statutory Auditors gives
its opinion on the basis of inquiries made by the person responsible for internal control.In order to make available the broad range of information needed by the Board of Statutory
Auditors to perform its control function effectively, a procedure has been put in place, as
mentioned earlier ,for the collection and transmission to the members of the Board of Sta tutory
Auditors (and the directors) of inf ormation on: the activity carried out by the Company; the
transactions of greatest significance for the Company’s profitability, financial position and assets
and liabilities; transactions with rela ted parties (including intra-group transactions); and a typical
and un usual transactions.
In addition to the tasks perf ormed in its Audit Committee ca pacity, the Board of Statutory Auditors
carried out supervisory functions provided for under Italian law: verifying that the transactions of
greatest significance for the Company’s profitability, financial position and assets and liabilitiesconformed with the law, the bylaws and the principles of correct management; checking that
transactions with rela ted parties complied with the self-regulatory principles and procedures
adopted by the Company and that they were in its interest; and checking the adequacy of the
organizational structure. The Board of Statutory Auditors also monitored the adequacy of theinternal control system and tha tof the administra tive and accounting system and the latter’s
reliability in correctly representing transactions. Lastly, the Board of Statutory Auditors
investigated the reports it received under Article 2408 of the Civil Code and the complaintssubmitted to it during the y ear,as described in its report to the shareholders’ meeting.
/L50123SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETINGS
Ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings w ere held on 6 May 2004. In addition to
approving the annual report for 2003, appointing the new Board of Directors, engaging the
external auditors for the three years 2004-06 and redetermining the fees to be paid to the Boardof Auditors, the shareholders approved, in accordance with the bylaws, the Rules of Proceeding for
the Shareholders’ Meeting and some amendments to the bylaws. The latter served not only to
bring the bylaws into line with the reform of company law but also (i) to broaden the powers ofthe Board of Directors under Article 2365 of the Civil Code; (ii) to exclude from the events giving
the right of withdrawal the extension of the duration of the Company and the
introduction/amendment of restrictions on the circulation of shares; (iii) to introduce thepossibility of increasing the share capital for cash with the exclusion of the right of pre-emptionwithin the limits laid down by law; (iv) to change the mechanism whereby shareholders arelegitimized to attend shareholders’ meetings; and (v) to authorize the Board of Directors toincrease the share capital and to issue convertible bonds.

documents needed for informed participation to all those who request them and by allowingordinary shareholders to vote by mail. 
Furthermore, pursuant to the bylaws, the Company makes special areas available to associations
of employee shareholders where they can provide information and collect proxy forms.The special meeting of savings shareholders held on 26 October 2004 reappointed Professor Carlo

/L50123CODE OF ETHICS
The Code of Ethics of the Telecom Italia Group can be considered as lying upstream from the
whole system of corporate governance and as enshrining the set of fundamental values and
principles that serve to ensure an ethically-oriented conduct of business. The Code, which has
gradually been adopted by all the companies belonging to the Group, specifies the objectives tobe aimed at and the values to be fostered in relation to all the main stakeholders Telecom Italia
interacts with every day: shareholders, financial markets, customers, local communities and
emplo yees.
Likeall the Compan y’s other instruments of corporate governance, the Group Code of Ethics is
continuously reviewed in the light of developments in the applicable law and operational and
mark et practices, and with considera tion also giv en to the results of the monitoring of units’
compliance b ythe person responsible for internal control. The present version of the Code, last
revised in March 2004, replaces that adopted following the completion of the merger of the
“old” Telecom Italia into Oliv etti on 4 August 2003. Compared with the earlier version, it takes
account of the requirements deriving from the company’s listing in the United States, primarily
as regards the Code of Ethics referred to in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Code of Conductrequired b ythe listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which make it mandatory to
have a code of conduct for certain categories of officers (executive, financial and accounting).
In addition, the form and substance of the earlier text were improved by reorganizing and
adding to the content.The Group Code of Ethics is thus more closel ycoordina ted with the Company’s other instruments
of corporate governance and increasingly at the centre of the internal control system.
/L50123RULES OF CONDUCT FOR TRANSACTIONS
WITH RELATED PARTIES
Since 2002, the Company has adopted guidelines  for carrying out transactions with related
parties. They are intended to ensure both procedural and substantial fairness and transparency by
entrusting the related decisions to the Board of Directors.
In fact, under the guidelines, the Board of Directors is required to give advance approval totransactions with rela ted parties, including intra-group transactions, apart from those of a
customary nature to be concluded at standard conditions. To this end, provision is made for the
Board to be adequately informed of all the relevant aspects: the nature of the relationship, themanner of carrying out the transaction, the economic and other conditions, the ev aluation
procedures used, the rationale for the transaction and the Company’s interest in its
implementation and the associated risks. Moreover, if the related party is a director or a partyrelated via a director, he or she may only provide clarification and must leave the meeting when themotion is examined and put to a vote.Depending on the nature, value and other aspects of related-party transactions, the Board may beassisted by outside experts in order to prevent contracts being concluded at inappropriate

65 Shareholdersconditions. Such experts must have suitable professional experience and qualifications in the field
in question and their independence must be carefully assessed.The changes made to the “Vietti reform” of company law by Legislative Decree 310/2004 were a
factor in the revision of the guidelines, with the introduction of an explicit reference to a concept
of “normality” applicable to intra-group transactions. Provision has also been made for a procedure(currently in preparation) to complete and overarch the system. More specifically, the aim of the
procedure is to provide an objective basis for the treatment of concrete situations. Before any
transaction is carried out, it will be necessary to consult an expert system (appropriately interfacedwith a database containing the related parties of the Group companies that have adopted the
guidelines) that will automatically provide - on the basis of information gathered using ad hoc
checklists - indications concerning decision-making powers, internal information flows for reporting
purposes, and the need for an external opinion in evaluating the fairness of transactions.
/L50123MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION
Transparent relations with the market and the provision of accurate, clear and complete
informa tion are standards f or the conduct of the members of the go verning bodies, the
management and all the emplo yees of the Telecom Italia Group.
Confidential information is dealt with the Chairman of the Board of Directors on the basis of
procedures f or the internal processing and disclosure to third parties of documents and
information concerning the Company, with special reference to price-sensitive information.
Telecom Italia has adopted a special procedure, partly amended in 2004, establishing the ways in
which price-sensitiv einforma tion is to be communica ted to the market. It identifies the units of
the Company’s organization involved and lays down guidelines for the action to be taken in the
presence of rumours and in response to requests for information from the entities responsible forsupervising and opera ting the markets (Consob and Borsa Italiana). The procedure also lays down
guidelines f or meetings with the financial community and the press, to ensure that information
concerning the Company and the Group is not disclosed selectively.
The Company has also established a Disclosure Committee to provide assistance to the Board ofDirectors and top management in the processing and handling of da ta and ne ws necessary for the
correct provision of information. The main tasks of the Committee are:
(i) to assist the Board in the preparation of corporate communications, the top management in
the certif ication of the annual report in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the
Chairman of the Board of Directors in dealing with price-sensitiv einforma tion;
(ii) to ensure that corporate communications are prepared correctly with a view to their
approval;
(iii) to monitor the a pplication of the procedures and controls for the collection, analysis and
retention of da ta and inf orma tion f or pub lication and filing, verify their adequacy and
effectiveness and propose corrective measures;
(iv) to verify the correct application and need for updating of the “Procedure for communicating
price-sensitiv einforma tion” and suggest improvements where appropriate; 
(v) to supervise the structure and updating of the Company’s website as regards its institutional
contents.

/L50123RULES OF PROCEEDING FOR SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETINGS
On 6 May 2004 the shareholders’ meeting approved the Rules of Proceeding for Shareholders’
Meetings, as provided for in the bylaws.
The rules are substantially the same as those that were in force at the “old” Telecom Italia beforeit was merged into Olivetti, which had been found to provide effective support for conducting
shareholders’ meetings. The rules have therefore been updated and simplified, with the addition
of a section on v oting b ymail, so as to ensure the document pro vides the fullest possib le
organizational and procedural guidance for an important moment in shareholders’ participation in
the life of the Company.
