EMPLOYEE MATCH
The Employee Match program doubles the positive impact employees have on causes that are near  
to their hearts by matching their contributions to the eligible charity of their choice once per year.  In calendar year 2017, more than 1,000 employees participated in the program, and as a result we  donated $1 million—our largest contribution yet—to over 1,000 not-for-profit organizations. Since 2011, Constellation Brands and its employees have donated over $3.5M to organizations around the world.  
NOURISHING NEIGHBORS
Through our Nourishing Neighbors program, 
we provide employees with paid time off so  they can volunteer and help the fight against hunger in their communities. In fiscal year  2018, to celebrate our fourth annual Nourishing Neighbors initiative and to provide our employee volunteers greater flexibility, we expanded the program from one week to a full month.
