PROFESSIONALSECOLAB AT A GLANCE
In our business, we see the signs of progress 
all around us. Whether it’s saving water and 
energy or reducing waste and greenhouse 
gas emissions, there’s a growing realization 
that these priorities go hand in hand with 
business growth and profitability.
We all must work together to make the 
most of this opportunity. If we seize it 
now, we can build an economy that offers 
sustainable growth for all without creating 
additional harm to our planet.
At Ecolab, we are privileged to help drive 
these positive developments forward.  
Our expertise puts us at the crossroads  
of global macro trends. Around the world, 
we help our customers 
deal with the demands 
of population 
growth, economic 
growth, urbanization, 
changing consumer 
habits, climate change 
and water scarcity.
We do this in ways 
big and small, from 
providing a more water- and energy-  
efficient dishmachine program to your  
favorite restaurant to reducing water  
for steel mills, car manufacturers and  
power plants. In each case, we help our  
customers work more efficiently and  
reduce costs, while lowering their impact  
on the environment and saving energy  
and natural resources.
In 2018, we helped our customers around 
the world save 188 billion gallons of water, 
equivalent to the annual drinking water 
needs of 650 million people. We are on  
our way to achieving our 2030 goal of 
saving 300 billion gallons, enough for  
one billion people. We also helped customers 
save 19 trillion British thermal units (BTUs) of energy, avoid 2.4 billion pounds of 
greenhouse gas emissions and eliminate  
54 million pounds of waste.
We can do that because of our mix of 
service, expertise, insights and innovation. 
Using connected digital technology and 
data science, we can do things that were 
simply impossible just a few years ago. 
Today, for instance, we have 40,000 of 
our connected 3D TRASAR™ smart water 
sensors deployed worldwide, across a host 
of industries. Thanks to that network, we  
can spot trends that were previously 
invisible and address problems before  
they happen. That helps our customers 
adjust to changing 
circumstances in real-time,  
boost efficiency and minimize 
their environmental impacts.
By the nature of our work, 
we help companies achieve 
their sustainability goals.  
In the aggregate, this  
moves the world closer  
to the ambition of  
UN Sustainable Development Goal 6: 
Ensuring access to clean water and 
sanitation for all.
Meanwhile, we are steadily improving 
sustainability within our own operations.  
We are making systematic investments  
in reducing, reusing and recycling water  
at our plants around the world. Building  
on steady efficiency gains, we are closing  
in on our greenhouse gas emissions 
reduction goal of 10 percent by 2020,  
and thanks to a renewable power deal  
that we closed in 2018, we are set to 
surpass it significantly.
At the same time, we kept more than  
71 million pounds of plastic out of landfills  
in the last five years. We did that by using recycled plastic instead of virgin resin 
and by thinking constantly about how we 
can design our products more efficiently. 
One example: using concentrated solid 
chemistries in shrink wrap instead of bulky 
liquids in large containers, which reduces 
plastic needed for packaging by 99 percent.
Given what I see at Ecolab and beyond, I 
am optimistic that we can collectively forge 
a sustainable path forward. Much of the 
technology we need to continue to innovate 
is here today. Now is the time to step up  
our efforts and expand our positive impact.
We as business leaders have a special role 
to play. We can’t turn the world around all 
by ourselves, but together, we are key to 
getting things moving. That’s why we must 
set big, ambitious goals. Change is always 
hard. It’s best to make sure the returns  
are worth the work. So we say, “Go big.”  
And that is really what Ecolab is equipped  
to drive: change that matters.A LETTER FROM ECOLAB’S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Colgate-Palmolive has a strong and 
longstanding commitment to sustainability. 
By 2020, the global oral care, home care, 
personal care products and pet nutrition 
company aims to reduce water intensity 
in its manufacturing operations by half, 
energy intensity by one-third and absolute 
greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent,  
all over a 2002 baseline.
Its Mission Hills plant in Guanajuato, Mexico, 
is one of the world’s largest toothpaste 
production facilities. It also produces 
deodorant, and dish and bar soaps. With  
a strong culture of sustainability, the 
Mission Hills plant does all it can to 
conserve water. It is a zero liquid discharge 
site that recycles its treated wastewater for 
use in the plant’s utilities and landscaping. 
Prior to working with Ecolab, cleaning 
and sanitizing the plant was a manual, 
hot water-only process that consumed 
significant time, water and energy.INNOVATION
The plant enlisted Ecolab’s help to 
improve the efficiency and sustainability 
of its cleaning and sanitizing process. 
Ecolab brought new solutions to  
Mission Hills’ eight manufacturing  
lines. One of these, an Ecolab detergent, 
removes a wide array of stubborn 
processing residues from production 
equipment. The other, an Ecolab sanitizer, 
provides one-step sanitizing with the 
potential to eliminate a final water rinse.
Together, these solutions led to:
• Substantial reductions in cleaning times
• Elimination of manual washes
•  Improved cleaning reliability and  
product quality assurance
•  Significant savings in time, water  
and energy use

As one of the world’s largest food and 
agriculture companies, ADM finds itself 
at the crossroads of a number of critical 
global challenges. The world’s population 
is increasing and people are becoming 
wealthier. Higher incomes lead to changing 
diets and more and more people moving 
from rural to urban areas. As a result of 
these trends, demand for food, water and 
energy is growing and evolving.
ADM has a key role to play in feeding 
the world, and it counts environmental 
responsibility among its core values.  
In alignment with the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals, the company  
aims to:
•  Reduce water usage intensity by  
15 percent by 20182
•  Reduce energy intensity by 15 percent  
by 20203
•  Reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
intensity by 15 percent by 20203INNOVATION
ADM worked with Ecolab to develop 
a sustainable process to drive water 
management improvements across its 
global operations. Leveraging the strengths  
of both organizations, ADM has implemented  
212 Ecolab projects globally since 2012 that 
have lowered energy and water usage while 
boosting operational performance. 
Best practices that Ecolab delivered through 
technology and automation were critical 
to these successes. One example is the 
deployment of 160 3D TRASAR™ Cooling 
Water Technology units around the world.  
3D TRASAR provides real-time monitoring 
and control of cooling systems to optimize 
water usage. The technology helps ADM 
reduce, reuse and recycle water within its 
plants and use graywater (recycled water) 
for its processes, increasing water resiliency 
at the local level. 
As a result of its partnership with Ecolab, 
ADM has been able to operate more 
efficiently while conserving natural 
resources. This has significantly reduced 
operational costs and helped the company 
achieve its sustainability goals.HELPING ADM SAVE

India is home to 16 percent of the world’s 
population but has only 4 percent of the 
world’s water at its disposal. India also is 
one of the largest producers of steel, a 
highly water-dependent industry. While 
much of that water is recycled, in 2017 the 
steel industry in India used approximately 
118 billion gallons of water.
One of India’s largest steel makers is 
working to change this. As a result of a  
six-year effort, the business lowered its 
water consumption by 2.3 billion gallons —  
equal to one year of drinking water for  
more than 7.9 million people, more than  
the combined populations of the cities  
of Kolkata and Pune.
INNOVATION
The water savings were the result of a 
leadership commitment on the part of the 
company and a partnership with Ecolab. 
Through smart water management, 
digital technologies, such as 3D TRASAR™ 
Technology, and operational management 
services provided by Ecolab, the steel 
maker optimized its cooling water use in 
a water-stressed area. Scaling and fouling 
in the cooling water made it difficult to 
achieve higher recirculation rates in the cooling system without using a lot of 
water. The issues were addressed, thanks 
to 3D TRASAR’s real-time monitoring and 
control, which is used to detect and correct 
variations in source water quality, reducing 
the demand for freshwater. These efforts 
also led to cost savings and reductions in 
energy consumption.
And this is just the start. Ecolab’s digital 
technologies are expected to lead to even 
greater freshwater savings by monitoring 
and controlling the water quality in the 
mill’s other critical circuits. In addition, 
water use was added to an online 
dashboard. This was a key step toward 
helping the company make more informed 
decisions and achieving its goal of  
zero liquid discharge.INDIAN STEEL PRODUCER FORGES

ORGANICALLY IN BRAZIL
INSIGHT
A global food manufacturing customer in 
Brazil was seeking organic certification 
for a new line of snack foods. Ecolab Pest 
Elimination had worked with the company 
for many years, administering pesticides 
three times a week. To produce organic 
snacks, the company needed to adjust  
its processes and find a solution that  
met organic certification requirements. 
The existing pest treatment process 
required a 12-hour halt in production after 
each application for evaporation of the 
water used in the solution and a thorough 
cleaning. The plant saw opportunities to 
improve not only its offerings, but also its 
operational efficiency and profitability.  
The new solution accomplished all three 
and contributed to a 30 percent increase  
in profitability.
INNOVATION
An on-site service specialist from Ecolab 
Pest Elimination inspected the plant and 
recommended structural improvements 
and hygiene solutions. 
Inside the facility, Ecolab:
• Increased inspections and the number  
of pheromone and floor glue board  
traps. This led to faster identification  
and capture of insects that had gotten 
into the plant. • Switched to organic products. These 
included neem oil, a naturally occurring 
pesticide found in neem tree seeds, and 
diatomaceous earth, a fine powder made 
from tiny fossilized algae-like plants. 
Ecolab also introduced the Global Large Fly  
Program. It uses an innovative outside-in  
approach, focused on finding the root 
cause of large fly activity and solving issues 
before flies reach the interior, reducing the 
food safety risks associated with large flies. 
The key element is the Stealth™ Fly Station, 
a reflective device that attracts flies before 
they can enter a facility.
The customer received organic certification 
for the new product line. Plus, without 
the required downtime after pesticide 
applications, the facility gained one day  
of production per month (24 hours),  
a productivity increase of 3.3 percent. Worker safety increased

Every second people use the internet, 
they rely on data centers to store, manage 
and distribute their information. As digital 
traffic grows, data centers are experiencing 
a global growth spurt. 
Data centers are buildings of servers that 
produce heat, so they require cooling, which 
takes large amounts of water and energy. 
Preventing microbiological growth is always 
an important part of the process. If not 
properly treated and maintained, the water 
used in data centers can be at risk for the 
presence of Legionella bacteria, which can 
cause Legionnaire’s disease, a serious and 
sometimes deadly form of pneumonia. An 
outbreak can cause significant financial  
and reputational damage.
SAP, a multinational software corporation 
based in Germany, operates many data 
centers around the world. The company 
is dedicated to improving people’s lives 
through technology and committed to 
sustainability. As an industry leader in 
water safety for employees and the 
communities in which it operates, SAP 
places a high priority on preventing 
bacterial threats. INNOVATION
In 2018, SAP built two data centers 
in Colorado Springs, Colorado. While 
designing these sites, the company’s 
engineers worked with Ecolab to ensure 
proper water safety practices were in  
place. This included implementing 
Ecolab’s 3D TRASAR™ Technology and a 
comprehensive water management plan. 
With these solutions, Ecolab has helped SAP 
take a holistic approach to water safety by 
properly treating water and continuously 
testing to minimize the threat of Legionella 
bacteria and help ensure safe water. 
By partnering with Ecolab, SAP is 
proactively managing the risks associated 
with the water used at its data centers 
globally. SAP is staying ahead of the game 
and demonstrating that it is a leader in the 
industry when it comes to water safety 
management practices and commitment 
to water safety. Ecolab helps SAP minimize 
risks and avoid unexpected costs that 
challenge the data center industry.

The rise in online shopping and delivery 
services, combined with consumer 
preferences for packaging materials that 
are produced in an ethical and responsible 
way, has had a major impact on the 
packaging industry. It’s more important 
than ever to create quality packaging, but 
manufacturers must do so while minimizing 
environmental impact.
INNOVATION
To accomplish both goals, one of the 
world’s largest paper and packaging 
manufacturers turned to its longtime 
partner Nalco Water, an Ecolab company.  
Through expert service and a focus  
on process and quality improvements,  
Nalco Water has been instrumental in 
helping the company achieve process 
optimizations and sustainability savings  
for everything from bleaching and wash 
water processes to improving asset life, 
reliability and quality.In 2018, Nalco Water identified an 
opportunity to help the company improve 
water use efficiency for a turbine condenser 
at a mill in the United States. This turbine 
generates nearly all of the plant’s electricity 
and is a key part of the overall papermaking 
process. Nalco Water implemented  
3D TRASAR™ Water Management Technology 
to help the turbine condenser operate  
more efficiently. The impact was two- 
fold: It optimized production and led to 
significant water savings. As a result,  
Nalco Water was able to save the company 
132 million gallons of water a year.

The restaurant sector is changing because 
of consumers’ evolving preferences —
especially on the part of millennials. 
Independent restaurants and regional 
chains are gaining in popularity, with 
almost 250,000 independent restaurants 
in the U.S. alone. While the large chains 
have dedicated supply chain, sustainability 
and food safety teams, the independent 
restaurateurs often have to work things  
out for themselves. Ecolab can help.
The Buttered Tin is a popular eatery  
in St. Paul, Minnesota. The owner is  
Alicia Hinze, a graduate of the famous  
Le Cordon Bleu cooking school and former 
winner of the Food Network's “Cupcake 
Wars” baking competition. With expansion 
plans in the works, she is looking to Ecolab  
for support.
“I’m an Ecolab fan because we’ve become 
such great partners,” she said.

that fit in her limited space. She turned 
to Ecolab, the world’s largest supplier of 
leased commercial dishmachines.
In 2015, Hinze joined Ecolab’s dishmachine 
testing program. The lessons learned 
at The Buttered Tin help restaurants 
elsewhere work more efficiently and 
sustainably. “The main reason for the 
testing is learning how to conserve water, energy and products,” she said. “How 
much do you use, what’s the optimal 
temperature? We’re learning all the time.”
For a small restaurant, optimizing 
chemistries and equipment also is a 
cost-saver. At The Buttered Tin, cleaning 
products, detergents and sanitizers are 
a significant weekly expense, so Ecolab’s 
highly efficient products not only save 
water and energy, but also money.
At the future locations Hinze is prospecting, 
she strives to be even more sustainable, 
and Ecolab will be there from day one.  
“It starts with the floor plan,” she said. 
“Where do we put the Ecolab dishwasher 
and the products? Or even just the floor 
itself: Ecolab tells us which products to  
use and how to clean it. It’s really important 
to get that right, because you can save 
products, time, energy and water.”LOCAL EATERY BECOMES

INSIGHT
What do you do when your facility has an 
abundance of water from heavy rains for 
half the year and is faced with drought the 
other six months? You look for a way to 
make the most of the water you have and 
ensure that it is clean, so you can achieve 
optimum system performance and bring 
down the costs associated with periods  
of water scarcity. 
Energias do Brasil (EDP) faced this  
situation at a power plant in northeast 
Brazil. The solution: Purate™ onsite  
chlorine dioxide generation.
INNOVATION
The EDP plant relies on lake water for its 
cooling system. During droughts, when 
there is less water in the lake and the price 
of water goes up, the plant reuses water so 
it can draw less from the lake. The power 
plant was looking to increase recirculating 
cycles from an average of six to seven 
cycles up to 10. To do this, it had to control 
high levels of minerals and microbiological 
growth in the water, both of which affected 
the cooling system’s performance. The plant also faced corrosion and foaming 
issues and it was using different treatment 
options to address these concerns. But 
the treatments failed to keep the cooling 
system clean.
To gain control of water quality in the 
plant’s cooling system, Ecolab introduced 
Purate Technology. Because Purate is 
more effective at treating corrosion and 
foam issues than the previous solution 
and is also a more effective disinfectant, 
it improved microbiological control and 
reduced chemistry consumption. Using 
Purate and its remote data monitoring 
capabilities, the power plant was able to 
increase cooling tower recirculating cycles 
up to 10, meet outgoing water quality 
standards and operate efficiently during  
the dry months of the year. Purate also led 
to significant reductions in energy usage 
and greenhouse gas emissions.
As a result of this partnership, Ecolab won 
EDP’s supplier of the year award in both 
2017 and 2018. BRAZILIAN POWER PLANT

BRIDGING THE GAP 
BETWEEN CORPORATE 
WATER GOALS AND  
REAL RESULTS
Most companies have water 
reduction goals, but too many 
don’t know how to achieve them. 
To close the gap, we launched the Ecolab Smart Water Navigator 
in partnership with industry-leading advisors. Drawing from an 
online assessment, the tool generates a step-by-step guide for 
each facility, tailored to its industry, location and current water 
performance. Using the guide, facilities can improve their practices 
until they master truly circular water management and become  
“Water-smart.”
The tool is free and publicly available for companies in any industry, 
anywhere in the world, whether they manage one facility or 
hundreds. www.smartwaternavigator.com
GLOBAL WATER  
CHALLENGES TOOLS FOR CHANGE
Water scarcity is the new normal. As the effects of 
population growth, economic growth and climate 
change put pressure on this essential resource,  
Ecolab is helping companies take steps to reduce  
their water usage and protect the needs of  
communities and the natural environment.
With Sustainable Development Goal 6, 
the UN calls for ensuring “availability and 
sustainable management of water and 
sanitation for all” by 2030. Because we  
help our customers manage more than 
a trillion gallons of water 
every year, there is no 
company that can do more 
to help business contribute 
to that goal than Ecolab.
If we want to help the one in nine people on 
Earth whose basic water needs are unmet, 
support the more than two billion who live 
in water-stressed areas today and preserve 
the global growth that has lifted hundreds 
of millions out of poverty in recent decades, 
industry will have to do more with less 
water. That goal is attainable, but the reality 
is that corporate water usage hasn’t fallen 
nearly enough.At Ecolab, we help companies of all 
sizes reduce, reuse and recycle water, 
so they can work more efficiently and 
grow sustainably. As an industrial water 
user ourself, we also know the value of 
stewardship  — collaborating with other 
stakeholders in the places where we 
operate to care for shared water resources. 
We are working with our customers, 
public institutions and non-governmental 
organizations to expand smart water 
management practices around the world.
Water stewardship is a crucial aspect of 
protecting the planet, but it also allows us 
to build successful, resilient businesses  
and a forward-looking economy in which 
people and communities can thrive. PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE WATER 
USE AROUND THE WORLD
Ecolab is a founding member of the 
Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS),  
a global coalition to promote sustainable 
water use. We were actively involved 
in the launch and implementation 
of the AWS certification framework, 
the International Water Stewardship 
Standard. In 2015, our plant in  
Taicang, China, was the first in the  
world to be independently certified 
under this standard. Ecolab’s facilities  
in Carson and City of Industry, California, 
were certified in 2017. Our plant in 
Garyville, Louisiana, is on track to be 
certified in 2019.ASSESSING THE FULL  
VALUE OF WATER
The real value of water for a 
company is not the same as 
what appears on its monthly 
water bill. To business, the 
cost of water scarcity is 
often significantly higher than its nominal price. Ecolab’s Water 
Risk Monetizer, a publicly available tool launched in 2014 in 
collaboration with Microsoft and Trucost and updated in 2017, 
places a dollar value on water risk for each of a user’s facilities. 
It provides actionable insights that help companies develop 
sound business strategies and positions them for growth in an 
increasingly water-scarce world. www.waterriskmonetizer.com71% of the world’s

TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION 
OF EXPERTS 
With sustainability concerns growing in 
importance for business and society, it 
is vital that we build a steady pipeline 
of experts offering fresh ideas and 
solutions. With that goal in mind, 
the Ecolab Foundation awarded a 
$5 million grant to the University 
of Minnesota in 2018, to support 
environmental sustainability research, 
student scholarships and education.
The program’s cornerstone is  
$2 million in funding for a new 
endowed chair at the University’s 
Institute on the Environment. A 
conference series will bring together 
top minds in the field to drive progress 
on major environmental challenges.
The Foundation also will invest more 
than $1.8 million in undergraduate 
scholarships. Additional Ecolab 
Foundation investments will support 
immersive student experiences with 
global and local partners, focused  
on water quality and supply, energy, 
sustainable development and  
public health.CLEANING UP AFTER DISASTERS 
When disaster strikes, disease and 
infections are never far behind. As the 
world’s leading supplier of cleaning 
and sanitizing solutions, Ecolab offers 
assistance to those in need. 
In 2018, we provided 617,400 pounds 
of Ecolab product donations, totaling 
$1.5 million, to relief efforts through 
partnerships with World Emergency 
Relief and Good360. 
Ecolab products were distributed to 
people affected by hurricanes and

LEAD
ECOLAB SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018  29 28 
OUR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Ecolab believes the best teams are diverse and inclusive. Our 
goal is gender and ethnicity representation that reflects our 
communities and we align our employee programs, recruitment 
and talent development efforts with this approach. 
In 2018, we enhanced our recruiting strategy to increase the 
diversity of our talent pool. We insist on diverse candidate slates 
and have begun to embed diversity and inclusion into all aspects  
of the employee experience. 
Our Board of Directors reviews our global representation 
metrics twice a year. Senior leaders are accountable for driving 
improvement in hiring and promotions. On a quarterly basis,  
Talent Councils create development plans for diverse talent, review 
scorecards for each business, function and region, discuss areas  
of progress and opportunity, and advise on further advancement. 
Our 10 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) represent Ecolab’s 
diverse culture. They provide opportunities for associates to 
develop, share business insights, drive engagement and experience 
a sense of belonging. With nearly 6,000 members and 72 global 
chapters, membership grew by 25 percent in 2018.PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY
We take a holistic approach to product 
sustainability, focusing on the total 
outcomes of our solutions. Our products 
and programs are designed to protect 
customers, natural resources and 
employees. We use rigorous, globally 
accepted scientific metrics to assess  
human health and environmental impacts. 
Ecolab never compromises on safety.
As shifts in consumer values and legislative 
oversight change the marketplace, 
everyone at Ecolab shares the responsibility 
of keeping our product portfolio and our 
customers ahead of the curve, making the 
right choices for people and the planet.
Our approach is based on systems 
engineering and the belief that products, 
packaging, digital technology, training and 
service should come together to deliver 
the best solutions in a safe, reliable and 
economical manner. This includes preparing 
our customers for changing legislation and 
product disclosure requirements.
We closely track every chemistry in our 
portfolio. Through our Enterprise Resource 
Planning system, we store and manage  
raw material and product information in  
a central database, down to the parts-per-
million level. 
The system houses global and regional 
restricted substance lists, enabling Ecolab  
to manage existing products and assess  
new innovations. The database also allows 
review by the Chemical Footprint Project,  
a nonprofit that benchmarks companies  
as they reduce chemicals of high concern  
and select safer alternatives.
We combine best-in-class programs with 
industry-leading service and go above and 
beyond regulatory requirements to ensure  
the long-term sustainable outcomes of  
our solutions.At Ecolab, we are working with our customers and  
in our own operations to conserve natural resources 
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.GOALS AND PERFORMANCE

per year by reducing water 
consumption in our own and  
our customers’ operations. 
This equals the annual drinking 
water needs of more than  
1 billion people.Our impact through customers is exponentially larger than the savings we achieve at  
our own facilities. In 2018, we helped our global partners save 188 billion gallons of  
water, equivalent to the annual drinking water needs of 650 million people. We are on 
track to meet our goal of saving 300 billion gallons annually — equal to the needs of  
one billion people — by 2030.
We also helped our customers conserve more than 19 trillion BTUs of energy and avoid  
2.4 billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions.
In our own operations, we reduced water withdrawals on an intensity basis by 1.4 percent 
from a 2015 baseline toward our goal of a 25 percent intensity-based reduction by 2020. 
We plan to bring further water-saving projects to completion by the end of 2020 to 
accelerate our progress.
At our plant in Clearing, Illinois, Ecolab’s largest water user, we installed a top-of-the-
line water reclamation system that will reduce the plant’s water use by up to 20 percent 
when the system is at full capacity (see page 32). Our Garyville, Louisiana, plant has 
reduced its water intake by 85,000 gallons a day, reusing filtered Mississippi River water 
(see page 32).
In 2018, we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions on an intensity basis by 8.4 percent 
from a 2015 baseline, close to our goal of 10 percent by 2020. We shifted our reporting 
from a location-based method to a market-based one, aligned with best practice 
standards, so we could account for our growing renewable electricity purchases and 
on-site generation.
The drivers for our emissions reductions are renewable electricity purchases in 
Europe and increased overall water and energy efficiency. Thanks to a North American 
renewable electricity deal we signed in 2018 (see page 32), we are set to surpass our 
global greenhouse gas emissions goal significantly.2018 MILESTONES

CHANGING THE WORLD, ONE DISHMACHINE AT A TIME
Ecolab’s capacity for innovation depends 
on our people. Every day, our Research, 
Development & Engineering team works on 
ways to make systems more efficient, lower 
their impact on the environment and save 
money for our customers.
One of those innovators is Research, 
Development & Engineering Program 
Leader Jonathan Butwinick, who led the 
development of Ecolab’s EHT dishmachine  
for restaurants. Before he joined Ecolab, 
Butwinick worked in the aerospace industry, 
designing avionics sensors for large 
passenger planes.
He came to Ecolab because he wanted to 
make a more significant positive impact on 
the environment and public health. “You 
don’t think about it when you’re enjoying a 
meal at a restaurant, but dishwashers are a big part of keeping our food safe,” he said.  
“If they don’t work correctly, food and 
bacteria can be left on silverware and 
plates, and you risk cross-contamination 
when dishes have to be rewashed by hand.”
Through an innovative combination of 
temperature, mechanical action and 
chemistry, the EHT machine does in  
60 seconds what a typical home 
dishmachine does in 60 minutes. It also 
uses 50 percent less water and energy than 
previous models. Each newly installed unit 
saves enough water to fill two backyard 
swimming pools every year and enough 
energy to drive a Toyota Prius 200 miles 
a day, when compared to a traditional 
dishmachine. Each machine is monitored 
remotely and Ecolab can alert restaurants 
to potential issues and send over service 
staff before anything goes wrong.“That’s just as much of an engineering 
challenge as designing any aerospace 
system, and just as satisfying,” said 
Butwinick. “You may not think dishwashers 
are very exciting, but think about the  
huge everyday impact in the world. 
Currently, there are more than  
660,000 restaurants in the U.S. alone. 
Almost every single one of them has at 
least one dishwasher. With all those units  
in operation, there’s enormous potential  
for water and energy savings.”When the 1,600 scientists, engineers  
and technical specialists working at our  
19 technology and innovation centers 
develop new and better solutions, 
delivering value is always top-of-mind.  
Most often, our products deliver a range  
of benefits, including efficiencies, cost 
savings and sustainable impact.
From packaging and ingredient chemistries 
to advanced analytics and digital 
technology, we never stop thinking of 
ways to support our customers around 
the world as they work to make their own 
operations more profitable, efficient and 
sustainable. That's why we incorporate 
eROI (exponential Return On Investment, 
see page 1) from the very first step in the 
development process.CUSTOMER-FOCUSED

SAVING MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF 
WATER ANNUALLY  | CLEARING, ILLINOIS  
Our plant in Clearing, Illinois, is Ecolab’s 
largest producer of colloidal silica, a 
material that touches everything from 
nanotechnology and LED lights to 
smartphone screens and metals. But 
colloidal silica manufacturing is water-
intensive. The Clearing plant consumes 
a quarter of all water used in Ecolab’s 
manufacturing facilities, more than  
any other.
One of the ways that we are reducing 
water use at Clearing is by reusing 
process water. As a result, we have been 
able to expand colloidal silica manufacturing 
while using less water per ton. 
In addition, Clearing installed a water 
reclamation system that takes wastewater 
from the colloidal process and treats it for 
reuse. When at full capacity, it is expected 
to reduce the plant's water use by up to  
20 percent.
The Clearing facility proves that older 
plants can be just as water-smart as new 
ones. Customers will be able to learn about 
these technologies when the Clearing 
Customer Experience Center opens in 2019.  
WIND POWER DEAL PUSHES ECOLAB 
PAST ITS GREENHOUSE GAS 
EMISSIONS TARGET | TEXAS 
In late 2018, Ecolab inked a virtual power 
purchasing agreement (VPPA) with 
renewable energy producer Clearway, which  
is constructing a 418-megawatt wind farm 
in Texas. When the facility opens in 2020, 
Ecolab will participate in 100 megawatts  
of that capacity — enough to power  
27,000 single family homes for a year.
The deal is expected to cover 100 percent  
of Ecolab’s annual electricity use in the United States, and will enable us to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent, 
more than doubling Ecolab’s goal of a  
10 percent reduction by 2020.
REDUCING WATER INTAKE BY  
85,000 GALLONS A DAY |   
GARYVILLE, LOUISIANA 
Ecolab’s plant in Garyville, Louisiana, is 
our second-largest manufacturing facility 
by volume and second-largest water user. 
Located on the Mississippi River, it takes in 
600,000 to 700,000 gallons of river water 
a day.
The plant uses sand filters and continuous 
backwash technology to purify river water 
before it can be used in the manufacturing 
process and discharged back into the 
Mississippi River. The filters deliver 
excellent water quality, but in the past,  
100 gallons of water per day was required 
to clean them.
In 2018, we started reusing the backwash 
water at the start of the manufacturing 
process. This reduces the plant’s intake  
of river water by 85,000 gallons a day.  
The plant also is using less chemistry  
and saving electricity by running pumps 
less often.  
REACHING 100% RENEWABLE  
ENERGY  | EUROPE
This year, we set an ambitious 2020 goal  
for our plants in Europe: Ensure that  
100 percent of the energy we use comes  
from renewable sources. And we’re just  
about there, with 99.4 percent of our 
electricity now generated by renewables. 
We did this by: investing in more energy-
efficient production equipment, moving 
from incandescent to LED lighting across 
the region, purchasing renewable energy 
and installing solar panels.PUTTING A LID ON PLASTIC PACKAGING
Ecolab has been steadily reducing its use of plastic. In 2018, we saved more than 15 million pounds of newly produced plastic. Because of 
innovations in the way we formulate and package products for our customers, we have kept 71 million pounds of plastic out of circulation 
since 2014. We also have increased the recycled content in our plastic packaging materials by 10 percent every year since 2014.
Dishwashing detergent  
By moving from liquid chemistry in a bulky container to 
a shrink-wrapped solid capsule for our SMARTPOWER™ 
warewashing program, we reduced plastic use by more  
than 99 percent since 1960 while delivering the same  
clean end result.Cleaning products  
Our Oasis Pro system dispenses professional cleaning 
products into reusable bottles from small pouches, 
replacing single-use spray bottles.
Industrial chemistries in reusable totes  
By delivering products in one 330-gallon intermediate bulk 
container (IBC) instead of six 55-gallon drums, we save  
87.2 pounds of plastic.
Ecolab’s drums and IBCs are reusable for up to three years. 
This reduces the number of new 55-gallon plastic drums 
required by approximately 24 percent, and the number of  
new IBCs by just over 25 percent. PORTA-FEED™ containers  
In 1985, Ecolab’s Nalco Water 
division began shipping 
industrial chemicals in steel, 
reusable bulk containers 
instead of plastic single-use 
drums. Since its introduction, 
the PORTA-FEED program 
has eliminated disposal 
of more than four million 
chemical drums.20 L CONTAINER

Our overarching safety goal is zero incidents. But Goal Zero is not just a number, it is a 
journey. On the way there, Ecolab places great value on training and education. Both at our own facilities and customer locations, we assess risk before we start work, identify and address safety issues, and remedy hazardous situations.WORKING

a
t any Ecolab location,  
and wherever we operate. That is the safety goal we set for ourselves. 
As we work toward this goal, we place  
great value on setting high global  
standards and developing new ways  
to deliver our safety programs across  
a complex global workforce. We combine  
a data-driven approach to risk reduction 
with education, engagement and team member empowerment. Everyone is expected to halt work any time they see  
an unsafe situation. The health and safety  
of our employees is our highest priority.
INCREASING DRIVER SAFETY
With 27,000 field associates visiting 
customers at about three million locations in more than 170 countries, driving is a key risk factor and a prominent area for improvement. Since 2013, we have reduced our total vehicle accident rate by 8 percent and our severe vehicle accident rate by  
29 percent.
In 2018, our U.S. Pest Elimination team 
successfully piloted a predictive driver safety program that reduced accidents by 30 percent. The program uses training and coaching, and applies digital technology  
to measure driving behavior and indicators such as traffic tickets to identify drivers  
who are most likely to have an accident.  
The program will be deployed in the  United States and Canada in 2019 and expanded to other countries starting  
in 2020. 
The benefits of the program stretch well 
beyond the workplace. We know that good driving habits learned at work will transfer to employees’ off-duty driving, increasing safety for their families and the community.
SAFETY EVERYWHERE WE WORK
In 2018, our personal injury rate decreased 
3 percent and our lost time injury rate in North America fell by 5 percent.
To continue to reduce accidents and 
injuries, we make sure that all employees have easy access to safety information.  
In 2018, Ecolab launched 13 global policies emphasizing a high level of risk awareness and mitigation for all employees, across all divisions and countries, and within our own Supply Chain organization.
The policies establish a common set of 
expectations and tools for all employees. Our global safety programs are easily accessible for employees through an  
app that works on all mobile devices and  
is available in 19 languages, providing a truly global tool that matches the needs  
of our workforce.As a result, we have seen a significant increase in the number of employees engaging in our safety programs along with improvements in our injury rates.
SAFETY CULTURE
Companies with the strongest safety  
results foster a culture that puts safety, 
health and environment concerns first.
In 2018, Ecolab assessed its safety culture 
through a global engagement survey sent to all employees. These survey questions addressed different aspects of workplace safety, including leadership support, adequacy of training, and whether employees feel they can stop work if they feel unsafe.
The safety questions had the most positive 
ratings on the global survey. Ecolab’s 85 percent positive response rate was significantly higher than the benchmark for other Fortune 500 companies. Most important, the questions revealed remaining areas for improvement and opportunities to continue to enhance  
our safety culture.
We are pursuing those opportunities to 
further strengthen safety throughout our organization. As we get closer to zero, the safety of our people and those whose lives we touch remains our number-one priority.ECOLAB SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  20 18 3 7 36  RANKED #2 IN
