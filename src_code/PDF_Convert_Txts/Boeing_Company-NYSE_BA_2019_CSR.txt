Solar Facility in central 
Washington state. Two 
Boeing sites use 100 
percent renewable energy: 
Renton, Washington, 
home of the 737, and the 
787 Dreamliner factory in 
Charleston, South Carolina.In just over a decade, we’ve reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions in our 
production facilities by 28 percent while 
increasing aircraft deliveries 66 percent.
We’re pushing further with new 
technologies that will improve aerospace 
efficiency and reduce emissions and the 
environmental footprint of our products. 
You can see this demonstrated in our  
787 Dreamliner, which uses 20 percent 
less fuel, and our 777X, which will be  
the world’s largest and most fuel-efficient 
twin-aisle airplane when it takes to  
the skies. This is also evident in our  KC-46A Pegasus tanker, whose quieter 
engines and fuel-efficient design enable 
lower operating costs than the former 
KC-135 Stratotanker. Looking to the 
future of mobility, our electric-powered, 
fully autonomous passenger air vehicle 
prototype started test flights this year. With 
a range of up to 50 miles (81 km), it has  
the potential to shape the future of air travel 
and transport.
We’re also making strides in developing 
sustainable business solutions, such as 
biofuel. Last year, our teams worked with 
key partners to support the world’s first Dennis Muilenburg

1CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGEpassenger flight powered by plant-based 
fuel, flown by a 787. Starting this year, our 
customers can choose sustainable fuel  
for their new deliveries. 
With our ongoing ecoDemonstrator 
program, we’re developing additional 
environmental technologies. Last year’s 
777 Freighter tested nearly 40 new 
innovations, including flight deck updates 
that enable pilots to more effectively 
manage their routes to save fuel, reduce 
emissions and arrive earlier.
Across our sites, we’re finding ways to 
reduce waste. For example, we identified a 
fluid used in CST-100 Starliner command 
module testing that’s useful as a general 
cleaning agent in our factories instead of 
being discarded as waste. Separately, our 
defense team in Kent, Washington, found 
ways to reallocate equipment that the 
location no longer needed, resulting in a 48 
percent reduction in solid waste for the site.
Additionally, we’re collaborating with and 
investing in companies that share our 
goal of a more sustainable future. This 
includes a partnership that will reduce solid waste by about two million pounds 
(907,185 kg) annually by turning excess 
carbon fiber into products such as laptop 
cases, car parts and more. Through our 
Boeing HorizonX innovation cell, we’re 
making investments that will advance use 
of cleaner technologies and revolutionary 
manufacturing methods.
Our environmental focus truly extends 
to the communities where we live and 
work. Through direct grants, community 
partnerships and our people’s time, Boeing 
supports projects that protect stormwater, 
restore habitats and promote sustainable 
use of our natural resources.
We’re all responsible for caring for the 
Earth and encouraging others to do the 
same. Together, let’s build a brighter, more 
sustainable future for generations to come.

3LEADERSHIP MESSAGEAviation also affects the planet and our 
shared global environment. 
The air transport industry today supports 
an estimated 62.7 million jobs and  
$2.7 trillion in global gross domestic 
product (GDP), according to the Air 
Transport Action Group.
As the industry continues to grow, Boeing 
recognizes that pollution, natural resource 
scarcity and climate change are serious 
issues that require credible actions and 
global solutions.The United Nations estimates that the 
world’s population hit 7.6 billion in mid- 
2017 and adds another 83 million people 
every year. By 2030, the population will 
reach 8.6 billion and increase to nearly  
10 billion people by 2050. 
A growing population and urbanization 
will further boost global demand for 
transportation, with the industry being 
challenged to meet the demand without 
a corresponding growth of emissions, 
community noise or other potentially 
harmful environmental effects.

4OPERATING ENVIRONMENTThe U.S. National Safety Council’s  
Robert W. Campbell Award honors one 
company annually for integrating the 
highest standards of environment, health 
and safety (EHS) performance into all levels 
of business operations. Boeing won the 
2018 Campbell Award for achievements in 
improving its environmental performance  
and was cited for its “innovative 
approaches to EHS excellence.” 
For the ninth consecutive year, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency honored 
Boeing’s achievement in conserving energy 
with the 2019 ENERGY STAR Partner of 
the Year–Sustained Excellence Award.The Wildlife Habitat Council recognized 
Boeing’s efforts to restore and preserve 
critical wetlands and wildlife habitat at 
company sites across the United States, 
including the Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory in Simi Valley, California, the 
Lower Duwamish Waterway in Seattle 
(pictured below), and Boeing South 
Carolina in North Charleston. 
Energy-saving projects at Boeing’s 
Huntsville, Alabama, site earned the city’s 
2018 air pollution control award for helping 
reduce emissions and clear the air. 
Upgraded heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning chillers improved the site’s 
energy efficiency by 17 percent.

In 2018, Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight 
Sciences introduced Odysseus, a solar-
powered unmanned aircraft designed to stay 
aloft for months at a time. With a wingspan 
larger than a Boeing 777X airplane, Odysseus 
weighs less than a Smart car. It uses 
advanced solar cells to store power during the 
day while relying on batteries to remain aloft 
at night, creating zero emissions. 
Boeing sees the combination of payload 
and time-on-station as suited for a variety of 
missions — weather and climate research; 
broadband connectivity in underserved areas; 
disaster response imaging and more—all 
while powered by clean, renewable energy. TABLE OF CONTENTS PRODUCTS
8CUTTING-EDGE RECYCLING PROGRAM
More than one million pounds (454,000 kg) of 
excess carbon fiber annually from 11 Boeing 
factories, including the 777X Composite 
Wing Center, will stay out of landfills thanks 
to recycling innovations. In a groundbreaking 
new partnership, Boeing will provide United 
Kingdom–based recycler ELG Carbon Fibre 
with excess material. In turn, the material 
will be recycled and supplied to global 
manufacturers for products such as  
car parts and computer cases.
This innovative reuse of excess carbon fiber is 
one way Boeing is making its manufacturing 
processes more sustainable. Composite 
recycling will also help Boeing meet its target 
of reducing solid waste sent to landfills  
20 percent by 2025.EFFICIENCIES AND INNOVATION 
WITH 777
Boeing tested 37 developing technologies 
aboard a 777 Freighter in 2018 as part of 
its ecoDemonstrator program, including 
the world’s first commercial flight fueled 
by 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel 
(made from residual animal fats and 
plant oils). Other technologies included a 
compact thrust reverser that improves fuel 
efficiency, designed and built at Boeing 
South Carolina. A laser system that can 
detect clear air turbulence, enabling pilots 
to warn passengers and cabin crew 
beforehand, shows promise. Plans are 
in development for ecoDemonstrators in 
2019 and beyond.
Boeing’s new 777X, the latest iteration in 
the line, will begin flight testing in 2019.  
The 777X family will be the most efficient 
twin-aisle airplanes in service when they 
deliver in 2020.

9PRODUCTSSUSTAINABLE FUELS FOR REDUCING 
LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS 
Boeing’s achievements in developing 
sustainable aviation fuel involve more than  
two dozen collaborations with airlines,  
fuel companies and governments around  
the world. 
Recently, two innovative projects achieved 
first-flight milestones: In October 2018, a Virgin 
Atlantic Airways 747 flew the world’s first 
passenger flight using a blend of traditional 
fuel and biofuel made from steel mill waste 
gases. Three months later in January 2019,  
an Etihad Airways 787 flew the world’s first  
passenger flight powered partly with biofuel 
made from seawater-irrigated desert plants. 
Each of these collaborations represents 
Boeing’s work with international stakeholders 
to develop scalable biofuel supplies that are 
cost-competitive with traditional fuel.
Additionally, in March 2019, Boeing 
announced that customers will be offered the 
option of using biofuel on their delivery flights 
from its Renton and Everett airplane delivery 
centers in Washington State. Those flights 
will use fuel produced by World Energy and 
delivered by EPIC Aviation.TABLE OF CONTENTS PRODUCTS
10PRODUCTSBOEING DATA CENTER POWERED  
BY GREEN ELECTRICITY
Boeing is one of the earliest adopters 
across the nation to offset carbon emissions 
consumed at its primary data center, by 
using wind power. The action will save the 
equivalent electricity used by more than 
4,100 homes for one year as part of the Iron 
Mountain Green Power Pass Program.
Digital-driven data has enabled faster and 
more agile results for consumers. But all that 
data must be stored in a climate-controlled 
space that consumes vast amounts of 
energy. This offset agreement with Iron 
Mountain helps Boeing progress toward the 
goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
25% by 2025.
Iron Mountain powers its data centers with 
100% renewable energy secured through 
virtual power purchase agreements. It uses 
transparent reporting and is in line with 
Renewable Energy 100, Science Based 
Carbon Targets, and CDP reporting.
“Data centers are known for using a lot of 
energy, which presents unique challenges,” 
said Drew Bryck, Energy and Conservation 
Specialist. “Working with partners who help 
us clear the hurdles of securing renewable 
energy contracts in a leased space is 
incredibly valuable.”
Data centers in the U.S. are projected to 
consume approximately 73 billion kWh by 
2020, enough energy to power more than  
six million homes for a year.HALON BE GONE!
It took dedication by engineers and scientists  
at Boeing, but a safe and effective replacement 
for halon in hand-held fire extinguishers is 
finding its way onboard commercial airplanes. 
What’s more, Boeing researchers widely 
shared the results of their innovation to benefit 
the entire aviation industry.
Although highly effective, the common 
chemical agent in hand-held extinguishers 
was banned from production in the mid-1990s 
by the Montreal Protocol, an international 
treaty restricting ozone-depleting substances. 
It wasn’t easy finding an environmentally 
preferred alternative for halon. A team of 
Boeing engineers worked closely with the 
aerospace industry for 14 years to develop, 
test and acquire approval of a replacement 
chemical for halon. Since 2017, halon-free 
handheld cabin fire extinguishers are now 
available for new production deliveries.

11PRODUCTSEFFICIENCY?  
THERE’S AN APP FOR THAT
In 2017, Boeing launched a third business  
unit, Boeing Global Services, to provide agile,  
cost-competitive services to our customers 
worldwide. With a focus on complete, 
innovative solutions, Global Services 
continues investing in new avenues that drive 
efficiencies, optimize operations and improve 
environmental performance.
Over the last 10 years, Boeing has reduced 
printing services by 80 percent by enhancing 
digital offerings for aeronautical charting. 
Software and data analytics–powered tools 
help airlines navigate and operate  
more efficiently, reduce fuel consumption, 
optimize crew utilization, minimize disruption 
impact and increase asset availability.
Fuel accounts for up to 40 percent of 
an airline’s operating cost. Finding ways 
to reduce that cost has become critical 
to every airline’s success. Tools such as 
Boeing subsidiary Jeppesen’s enhanced 
Fuel Dashboard and its companion Pilot 
Insight application address that need by 
enabling pilots to make informed decisions 
on discretionary fuel and fuel savings in just 
a few seconds, which helps reduce fuel use 
by an average of 1 to 2 percent. This visibility 
enables better decision-making to reduce fuel 
use, operating costs and carbon emissions. 
Additionally, Boeing’s FliteDeck Pro mobile 
airline charting application has been 
enhanced with a new weather layer feature 
that provides increased situational awareness 
for efficient flight planning, scheduling and 
operations management.TABLE OF CONTENTS PRODUCTS

13MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR 
PROGRESS
Creative ideas from Boeing employees make 
a difference by reducing waste, conserving 
resources and improving environmental 
performance.
The ideas, energy and action of a single 
person or team—real leadership—can 
make a big difference in helping Boeing meet 
its ambitious environmental strategy and 
performance targets. Boeing encourages 
employees’ creativity and actions to improve 
the company’s environmental footprint with its 
Environmental Leadership Awards.
The recognition spotlights innovative projects 
and ideas across the company that are 
reducing waste and saving energy while 
cutting costs. The awards also provide 
visibility for projects that can be replicated 
by other teams at other sites. 2018 winning 
projects include major LED lighting retrofits, 
heating and cooling system upgrades, water 
conservation and reductions in solid waste 
sent to landfill.
Energy-efficient chillers  
and other improvements 
at the Douglas Center 
office complex are helping 
Boeing’s Long Beach site 
reduce its energy use and 
boost energy efficiency.TABLE OF CONTENTS PEOPLE
14SMALL CHANGE, BIG SAVINGS
“Our success was in being able to see the 
work we do every day with a new set of  
eyes,” said Dave Shirley, chemical process 
manager. “The volume of water we were  
using didn’t make sense and we wanted  
to improve the process.” 
A small change in tank-line operations 
at Boeing’s Auburn, Washington, site 
cut water use in half, saving 26 million 
gallons (98 million liters) a year, while also 
winning the project a 2018 Environmental 
Leadership Award. AWARDS FOR SPECTROLAB
“This new process will help Spectrolab 
significantly reduce energy use and costs,” 
said Spectrolab President Tony Mueller. 
Spectrolab, a Boeing company in Sylmar, 
California, earned a 2018 Environmental 
Leadership Award for the work of its Chilled 
Water Cutover team in developing a new 
process to reduce energy and increase 
cost savings for air-conditioned production 
and office space. The new method uses a 
more reliable central plant system, greatly 
increasing efficiency and uptime.

15BIG SITE, BIG PROGRESS
The 40,000 employees at Boeing’s largest 
manufacturing site in Everett, Washington, 
had the power to reduce energy use and solid 
waste to landfill in 2018. The facility—home 
to the commercial widebody jetliner factory, 
the world’s largest building by volume—saved 
enough energy to power about 3,000 U.S. 
homes, exceeding last year’s goal threefold. 
The site reduced solid waste sent to landfills 
by 1,000 tons (907 metric tons), equal to the 
trash produced by 1,300 people per year.
Energy-saving projects include retrofitting 
factory lighting with 5,700 LED lights, the 
energy equivalent of powering about 300  
U.S. homes.EVERYONE WINS IN BATTLE  
OF THE BUILDINGS
A little friendly competition 
can go a long way. Boeing 
employees at 47 Boeing sites 
in six countries took part in 
the company’s first large-
scale competition in 2018 to 
see which site could reduce 
energy use the most. Boeing 
was the big winner: all participating  
sites cut their electricity use—several by 
double digits. 
This year, the same competition—Battle 
of the Buildings (BoB)—focused on solid 
waste, reminding employees to Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle and Rethink. 
One of Boeing’s 2025 environmental 
targets is to reduce solid waste to landfill 
by 20 percent from the 2017 baseline. To 
get there, Boeing will need more innovative 
approaches, including collaborating with 
suppliers to reduce—or even eliminate— 
packaging materials. Employees will find 
more creative, and fun, ways to continue 
increasing recycling and composting.

FIRST EUROPEAN FACTORY OPENS
Officially opening in October 2018, Boeing 
Sheffield is the company’s first manufacturing 
site in Europe. Boeing Sheffield is on target to 
achieve an “excellent” BREEAM rating—the 
highest degree of building sustainability. The  
factory design features efficiencies like photo-  
voltaic solar to power the factory, a smart 
building management system to control heating  
and cooling, LED lights that respond to 
motion or CO 2 levels, and a complex metering 
system that monitors electricity consumption.
In an additional commitment to operate 
responsibly both locally and globally, the site 
has set a goal to achieve zero waste to landfill. 
Boeing is applying the same environmental 
principles to the design and construction of 
its new hangar at Gatwick Airport in London 
and the new facility at RAF Lossiemouth in 
Scotland.NATURE MEETS INDUSTRY
As Boeing’s first delivery center outside of 
the United States, this facility in Zhoushan, 
China, is designed to showcase the 
company’s world-class technology while 
expressing its respect for the Chinese 
culture, people and environment.
The facility is a balance of nature and 
industry, with tranquil garden grounds at 
the Delivery Center on one side and an 
active hangar and airplane operation on 
the other.
The Delivery Center site is located on a 
nearly 28-square-mile (72 square kilometer) 
island where rain water conservation is a 
priority. The onsite stormwater reclamation 
system collects and treats rain water for 
re-use in the cooling tower, landscape 
irrigation and freshwater retention pond.

17NEW INDUSTRY, NEW LIFE FOR 
EXCESS CARBON FIBER
“Boeing’s product development looks 
decades into the future,” said Dr. Tia 
Benson Tolle, director of Commercial 
Airplanes Materials & Fabrication. “We 
need the best possible portfolio of 
materials, near and long term, for our 
products’ continued success in delivering 
value to our customers.”
Benson Tolle said a good example of this 
development is composite material made 
with carbon fiber, which has enabled 
generations of new Boeing aircraft that 
are lighter, more efficient and emit fewer 
emissions. 
Expanded use of composites presents 
the challenge of finding suitable methods 
of handling tons of excess carbon fiber 
produced in manufacturing. A new 
partnership between Boeing and ELG 
Carbon Fibre will keep more than one 
million pounds (454,000 kg) of carbon fiber 
out of landfills each year, which contributes 
to our target to reduce solid waste to 
landfill 20 percent by 2025.
“Five years from now, I want to look back 
and say we did the right thing,” Benson 
Tolle said. “As we look to the future and the 
demands humans are placing on natural 
resources, we need to think carefully about 
our products and the materials we use to 
make them.”PRIMING THE WAY TO SAFETY
“It’s very gratifying to know I am helping both 
people and the environment with my research 
to find safer primers for Boeing aircraft.”
Roland Stone, a chemical technology 
engineer, develops paint primers that help 
keep Boeing 737s shiny and corrosion-
free. Primers have traditionally contained 
hexavalent chromium, which can be harmful if 
inhaled during the painting process and also 
creates chemical waste. Stone is dedicated 
to finding paint primers without hexavalent 
chromium that effectively prevent corrosion 
and won’t harm people or the environment.
Dr. Tia Benson Tolle, 
director of Materials 
& Fabrication for 
Commercial Airplanes, 
and Kevin Bartelson, 
senior director, 777 Wings 
Operations, help discover 
ways to use excess 
carbon fiber.

GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
School Cleaning Days is an educational 
program promoted by Boeing in Italy. 
The program inspires primary school 
students to adopt ecological models 
of behavior and raise their awareness 
of sustainable development and 
environmental protection. The program, 
launched in 2011, helps children be more 
aware of environmental sustainability and 
understand how everyday behaviors can 
have a crucial impact on the environment. 
In its seventh year, School Cleaning Days 
reached nearly 5,000 students, 86 primary 
schools and more than 14,000 families 
all over the country. Boeing employees 
actively help educate school kids about  
the growing need for sustainable 
development through hands-on activities 
aimed at restyling and renovating schools 
across Italy. POWERFUL PRESERVATION 
PARTNERSHIPS
In 2018, Boeing made several investments in 
forest restoration efforts.
The Nature Conservancy in Washington and 
Oregon received $1.5 million—$1 million for 
Washington, $500,000 for Oregon. Funding is 
used for planting trees in urban areas around 
Puget Sound and Portland and in forests in 
Central Washington damaged in the Jolly

20AND THE WINNER IS …
Reducing environmental impact and 
improving worker safety are two things 
achieved by Boeing’s 2018 Supplier of 
the Year Environment Award winner, the 
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial 
Research Organisation (CSIRO). The 
Australia-based national science research 
agency has worked with Boeing for 
30 years to advance space sciences, 
manufacturing materials and other 
innovations for numerous aerospace 
products. 
To find a more environmentally conscious 
method of recoating aircraft skin to 
preserve its integrity, CSIRO and Boeing 
developed Paintbond, a chemical process 
used in painting that allows fresh topcoat 
to bond to previously painted layers. Not 
only does this process eliminate the need 
for sanding (and any associated worker 
fatigue issues), it also reduces airborne 
particulates. SPACE-BOUND SEEDS
In 1971, Stu Roosa took with him on the 
Apollo 14 mission 500 seeds from five tree 
species on Earth. His special cargo included 
100 seeds each of loblolly pine, sycamore, 
sweetgum, redwood and Douglas fir. When 
they were brought back to Earth, the U.S. 
Forest Service germinated the seeds and 
sent them around the country to be planted, 
eventually becoming “moon trees.” In honor 
of those first space trees, Boeing’s CST-100 
Starliner will carry the same mix of seeds on 
its maiden flight test to low Earth orbit: up 
to one pound (0.45 kg) of each seed type.  
When they return, they’ll be distributed to 
Boeing sites, suppliers and other stakeholders 
across the country, growing the first 
generation of Starliner trees.

21BUILDING BETTER ECONOMIES  
WITH BIOFUEL AND BUSINESS
Boeing actively supports the growth and 
development of sustainable aviation fuel 
resources, markets and small businesses 
around the world.
From 2016 –2018, Boeing Global Engagement 
provided three years of grants to South 
Africa’s micro-, small- and medium-sized 
businesses to help them participate in the 
emerging green economy and build a local, 
sustainable aviation fuel market.
These grants were also awarded to the 
World Wildlife Fund in South Africa and the 
Roundtable for Sustainable Biomaterials in 
Geneva, Switzerland, to help them evaluate 
the impacts of sustainable fuel feedstocks 
and engage with small farmers to build 
capacity and integrate sustainability into their 
operations.
The funding led to a better understanding 
of the most promising African locations for 
additional biomass to support the production 
of sustainable aviation fuel. It also laid the 
foundation for scaling up sustainable aviation 
fuel production.TABLE OF CONTENTS PLANET
22The analysis includes direct input and 
perspectives on industry best practices 
and community requirements from 
diverse stakeholders, such as customers, 
environment-focused non-governmental 
organizations (NGO) and the company’s 
global leadership.
The information helps Boeing identify and 
update our understanding of current  
and emerging sustainability issues that are  
critical to the company and our stake-
holders. It also informs our next-generation 
environmental strategy and targets.
Most Significant Environmental  
Risks and Opportunities
The assessment analyzed and prioritized 
diverse viewpoints and environmental risks 
as identified by Boeing and its external 
stakeholders. The risks relate to products, 
operations and a variety of other issues. 
Boeing and the stakeholders named the 
following risks and opportunities as our 
highest priorities: 
•  Products Greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions; fuel efficiency; operational 
efficiency; sustainable aviation fuel.
•  Operations  GHG emissions; energy 
conservation; water management; solid 
waste management/waste to landfill.Boeing included additional high-priority 
risks and opportunities, such as managing 
hazardous materials over the product 
life cycle in our operations, managing 
chemicals in aircraft production, pursuing 
innovations in alternative materials and 
designing environmentally progressive 
buildings.
External stakeholders added supply  
chain practices, such as reporting

24PRIORITIZATIONProgress continues on implementing a 
key component of aviation’s strategy to 
address global climate change. In 2018, all 
airlines worldwide flying international routes 
began formal monitoring and reporting 
of their emissions as part of the historic 
Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for 
International Aviation (CORSIA), adopted 
by the United Nations’ International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016.
CORSIA will help aviation meet its 
commitment to stop carbon emissions 
growth from 2020 and halve total carbon 
emissions by 2050 (see chart).
Environmental Regulation
The numbers of regulations and 
environmental concerns affecting the 
aerospace industry are increasing and 
include the following:
• Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
•  Airplane community noise
•   Local air-quality emissions for products 
and factory operations
•  Chemical restrictions in manufacturing 
operations and product content
•  Water quality issues, such as stormwater
•   Hazardous waste
•  Energy consumption and the use  
of renewable energy in operations
Chemicals and  
Regulatory Restrictions
Global regulation of chemical substances 
continues to grow. To illustrate, regulations 
expanded 50 percent per year from  
2003 to 2013—more than 50 times  
overall. That trend continues as efforts  
to reduce chemical exposure from 
consumer products affect more industries, 
including aerospace.Commercial Aviation  
and Climate Change
Aviation accounts for approximately 2 
percent of global CO 2 emissions, according 
to the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change. New global agreements 
reached in 2016 support achieving the 
industry-established goals and a global 
sectoral approach to controlling emissions:
•  A fuel-efficiency performance 
commitment for aircraft
•   A global market-based measure  
system, CORSIA
Implementation of these agreements into 
regulatory frameworks around the world is 
underway.
Customer Requirements
The aviation industry’s business goal of 
providing safe, cost-efficient travel and 
environmental goal of reducing CO2 
emissions are both achieved by constantly 
improving airplane fuel efficiency. Reducing 
emissions is aligned to our customers’ 
strategic desire to decrease fuel use.2010

Implementation 
of global sectoral 
approach  Progress continues on implementing a key component of aviation’s 
strategy to address global climate change. In January this year, 
all airlines worldwide flying international routes began formal 
monitoring and reporting of their emissions as part of the historic 
Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation 
(CORSIA), adopted by the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) in 2016. With CORSIA in place, the industry 
expects to offset 75 percent of the growth in global aviation CO 2 
emissions from 2020. Boeing supports the program, including tools 
and services from Boeing Global Services to help our customers 
with their CORSIA reporting needs.2020
Reduce carbon 
emissions by 50%
Half the net aviation 
CO2 of 2005Achieving this long-term goal requires research and development 
efforts in all areas of an airplane and its operation: from innovative 
new airframes, engines and materials technology for airplanes of 
the future —including hybrid and electric-powered airplane s—to 
researching new pathways and scaling up sustainable aviation fuel 
production. Boeing continues making technology and innovation 
investments and working in collaborative partnerships across the 
globe in all of these areas to enable the airplanes of the 2050 global 
fleet to operate with lower life-cycle emissions.2050Aviation contributes to a more sustainable 
planet by facilitating tourism and trade, 
generating economic growth, providing 
jobs and improving living standards for 
people around the world. An economic 
growth engine like this requires 
responsibilit y—one that Boeing and the 
aviation industry have proactively taken on by setting and implementing ambitious 
goals to sustainably grow the industry. 
From the beginning, Boeing has supported 
the goals established through the Air 
Transport Action Group, and Boeing’s 
market-leading, fuel-efficient airplanes 
continue to help the industry stay on track.

26ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGYInnovation is crucial throughout Boeing, from design 
and manufacturing to operations and services. 
Addressing our environmental footprint from the 
beginning to the end of service is important for 
environmentally responsible manufacturing solutions, 
including energy efficiencies, while also working 
toward eliminating hazardous chemicals in production.
In 2018, Boeing’s investments in research and 
development were essential for advancing technology 
and launching ventures like Boeing NeXt, which 
explores possibilities for future efficiencies.
Boeing factories finished 2018 1 to 7 percent better 
than plan toward the 2025 goals for greenhouse gas 
emissions, energy use and solid waste to landfill. 
Water and hazardous waste reductions remain 
challenging, however, requiring increased initiatives, 
innovations and research. 
The CDP (formerly called the Carbon Disclosure 
Project), the industry standard for environmental 
reporting, recognized Boeing with an A– rating 
for our CO 2 emissions reduction and transparent 
reporting.
Building on previous efforts between Boeing and 
organizations like The Nature Conservancy, Southern 
California’s TreePeople and the Lowcountry Land 
Trust in South Carolina, 2018 saw progress in 
promoting habitat restoration, advancing green 
stormwater infrastructure, improving the science 
associated with waterway cleanups and bettering 
communities around the world.Innovate for

time high in 2018 as the company removed 
barriers to enable environment-forward 
conservation behaviors. Boeing continues 
to work at reducing water consumption and 
hazardous waste. The company is exploring 
innovative ways to cut water use, even as 
airplane production increases. Due to an increased work scope in 2018, 
Boeing did not meet our challenging 
hazardous waste reduction goals. However, 
our teams are researching innovations 
to make great strides and redouble 2019 
efforts to stay on track for future goals.

  In addition to data from Boeing’s Core 
Metric Sites, Portland, OR (PDX Paint 
Hangar); Oklahoma City, OK; Moses Lake, 
WA; Arizona Data Center and Washington 
Data Center are also included.
  Carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO 2e, 
means the number of metric tons of CO 2 
emissions with the same global warming 
potential as one metric ton of another  
greenhouse gas (in accordance with EPA 
40 CFR Part 98, Mandatory Greenhouse 
Gas Reporting).  GHG emissions are calculated based on 
consumption of electricity, natural gas and 
fuel oil. (Our facility in Philadelphia is the 
only major U.S. site that uses No. 6 and 
other fuel oils for heating and curtailment 
backup.) Consumption of other fuels is not 
represented.
  For U.S. sites, Scope 1 emissions from 
natural gas, fuel oil and on-site generated 
electricity are calculated using the 
emission factors provided in U.S. EPA 
GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule. Scope 2  
emissions from purchased electricity 
are calculated using the market-based 
method and eGRID subregion factors, 
since residual mix is not available in the 
U.S. For the Canada site, Scope 1  
emissions are calculated using the 
emission factors provided in U.S. EPA 
GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule; Scope 2  
emissions are calculated using the 
market-based method and the supplier-
specific emission factor. For the Australia 
sites, Scope 1 emissions are calculated 
using the emission factors provided in 
the National Greenhouse and Energy 
Reporting (NGER) Scheme, and Scope 2  
emissions are calculated using market-
based method and the emission factors 
provided in the National Greenhouse and 
Energy Reporting (NGER) Scheme, since 
residual mix is not available in Australia. 
Emissions calculated with location-based 
method are: 1,230,000 tons (1,116,000 
metric tons) CO 2e (2018). Emissions 
calculated with market-based method 
are: 1,080,000 tons (980,000 metric tons) 
CO2e (2018).
  Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) 
were applied to the GHG calculation for 
the following locations: North Charleston, 
SC; Portland, OR; Phoenix, AZ; and six 
Puget Sound locations in Washington. 
In 2018, these Boeing locations made 
arrangements to purchase RECs to offset 
around 149,000 tons (135,000 metric tons) 
of GHG emissions.

  Other calculation factors: Data source 
of global warming potentials (GWP) is 
U.S. 40 CFR 98 subpart A, table A-1. 
For GHG inventory in North America, 
emission factors for combustion sources 
come from U.S. 40 CFR 98, subpart C, 
table C-1. For GHG inventory in the U.K., 
emission factors from the CRC Energy 
Efficiency Scheme are used. For GHG 
inventory in Australia, emission factors 
from the National Greenhouse and Energy

tory in locations where energy data are 
not accessible, 2012 CBECS factors are 
used to estimate the energy consumption 
and emission factors from the International 
Energy Agency’s “CO 2 Emissions From 
Fuel Combustion Highlights 2013.” “2006 
IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
