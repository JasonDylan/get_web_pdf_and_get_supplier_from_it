OVERVIEW29 30
2017 WAS A YEAR IN WHICH SK TELECOM SET A NEW GROWTH BASE 
TO BECOME A REPRESENTATIVE NEW ICT COMPANY.
In 2017, SK Telecom laid the groundwork to become a new ICT leader to bring about changes of 
the future, to go beyond Korea's No.1 telecommunications company. While renewing the new ICT 
strategy centered on mobile communication, media, IoT, and the 5G and AI-based service platform, 
we have succeeded in demonstrating the world ’s first 5G data communication network based on 
international standards and strengthened our network leadership. In addition, while strengthening our products and services based on the data analysis of customers in our MNO business, we have 
enhanced our business models in areas such as media, IoT, and AI through collaborations with 
external partners to create a growth ecosystem which will provide joint growth for everyone. 
As a result of these efforts, SK Telecom reported financial results of KRW 17,520 billion in 
revenue and KRW 1,536.6 billion in operating profit on a consolidated basis in 2017. Furthermore, 
SK Telecom continued to receive the highest levels of external assessments across all of its 
management activities by ranking 1st place in the National Customer Satisfaction Index (NCSI) 
for 21 consecutive years (as of 2018), being the first Asian telecommunications company to be 
included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) World Index for the tenth consecutive 
year, and maintaining the highest possible grade, “Excellent,” in the Win-Win Index for the sixth 
consecutive year (as of 2018). It was all possible due to the loyalty of our customers. SK Telecom 
will not remain complacent with current performance and are listening and considerate of our customers’ concerns to become a representative new ICT company that will be loved by more 
customers.
SK Telecom used the detailed analysis of the voice of the customers and is implementing a 
‘customer value innovation program’ that improves the penalty system and reforms roaming 
charges and memberships. It also eliminated excessive competition caused by marketing costs 
and provided actual benefits to customers. We are also aiming to earn customer trust through 
credibility in order to transform into a company that people love. Through these efforts, we have 
succeeded in increasing net subscribers and revenue generated from mobile telecommunications. 
SK Telecom will stabilize the market and streamline marketing costs to enhance trust-based 
customer relationships and will make achievements in the new ICT growth business as well.
WE WILL LEAD THE ICT ECOSYSTEM THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE 5G NETWORK AND INNOVATION OF BUSINESS MODELS THAT WILL 
LEAD TO OFFLINE-MOBILE CONVERGENCE.
SK Telecom defines 5G as a core infrastructure that will lead the 4th Industrial Revolution through wirelessization and is focusing its internal capabilities to commercialize 5G for the first 
time in the world in 2019. SK Telecom is building unrivaled competitiveness to lead the 5G era 
by securing distinguished technology such as network operating technology, next-generation 
technology based network solutions and quantum cryptography communication, and is leading 
the standardization process through partnerships with various global players.  President and CEO, SK Telecom

The 5G network will enable a hyper-connected era where 43 billion objects in the world are 
connected wirelessly with ‘safety’ as its core competitive edge. Since 2011, SK Telecom has 
been leading the development of the best existing security technologies including quantum 
cryptography and the creation of ecosystems. In February 2018, we acquired the Swiss company, 
IDQ, which holds the world’s best patent for quantum cryptography, and laid the groundwork for 
the global security market. Meanwhile, at the 5G spectrum auction in June 2018, we have secured 
the ‘largest amount of spectrum’ as an ‘optimal bandwidth’ which is helpful in providing secure 
service while making it easy to expand the frequency band. By doing so, we are preparing for the 
world’s first commercialization of the 5G network that provides the best quality.
In addition, as a mobile network operator and growth company, SK Telecom will develop business 
models based on autonomous vehicles, next generation technology-based high-definition media 
contents, and 360-degree live video calls which uses the 5G network’s core technologies such as 
ultra-high speed, ultra-low latency, hyperconnectivity, for the innovation of the new ICT generation.
SK Telecom is steadily moving toward the goal of becoming the No.1 media platform, with a 
continuous increase of wired and wireless IPTV subscribers and is creating continuous growth 
in content revenue. As the competitive edge of the media business is directly related to content capability, we will increase our investment in contents through strategic alliances and strengthen 
our platform services with the mobile media platform ‘oksusu.’ In addition, we will expand our 
platform based on the integration of technology convergence services including voice recognition, 
augmented reality (AR) and smart home, and will grow into the No.1 domestic comprehensive 
media company.
In the IoT area, we have secured a variety of network portfolios that can respond to demands 
from outside partners by completing LTE Cat.M1, the nationwide network in April 2018, following 
LoRa in 2016. In addition, we will expand our competitiveness in the IoT solution business 
based on our data analysis to security, distribution, logistics, and manufacturing, and will grow 
into a company that leads the digital transformation of existing industries. Meanwhile, in order 
to secure a new growth in the security business where global ICT companies are in a rush to 
enter, in May 2018, we have signed a contract to acquire ADT Caps, the second largest physical 
security provider in Korea. We will finalize the acquisition through the Fair Trade Commission’s 
M&A review process.
We have diversified the platform lineup and expanded the users of speech recognition services 
through the Korea’s first voice recognition AI speaker, ‘NUGU,’ in 2016 and with ‘T map x NUGU’ 
and set-top box ‘Btv x NUGU’ in 2017. We will upgrade the personal lifestyle pattern data 
collection and analyses, which links car, home and mobile, and we plan to expand the service 
that will innovate the value of life and build a virtuous circle structure of the AI platform.
The commerce sector was reorganized in June 2018 based on 11st, SK Planet's No.1 commerce 
platform. During this process, 11st was valued at KRW 2.75 trillion by H&Q Korea and was 
successful in attracting KRW 500 billion worth of new funds. 11st will continue to improve 
profitability through effective marketing based on data analysis, and we will strengthen the 
commerce sector, the core of our strategic category, to improve our growth potential.  Jung Ho Park
President and CEO, SK TelecomJune 2018WE WILL BECOME A GLOBAL NEW ICT COMPANY THAT THRIVES TOGETHER WITH 
SOCIETY THROUGH CHANGE AND INNOVATION.
SK Telecom not only provides products and services that add value to society by utilizing ICT-
based shared infrastructures, but also evaluates and manages the social and environmental 
impacts of its business activities by measuring the social value of its business performance. 
We also aim for the Double Bottom Line to increase environmental efficiency at the same 
time. In particular, we plan to create a sustainable future value beyond short-term growth 
by simultaneously pursuing economic performance as well as social performance throughout 
the entire management decision-making process that implements the company's management 
activities and core management strategies.
SK Telecom is now facing more difficulties than ever, due to the rapid technological development 
in the ICT sector, changes in market competition and regulations, and increased social demands. 
SK Telecom will strive to become a new ICT leader in a healthy way in 2018, with its shareholders, 
employees and business partners.
I would like to thank our loyal customers, investors, and stakeholders for your continued interest 
and support.

Becoming a New ICT Company  
In 2017, SK Telecom not only maintained its leadership in the MNO sphere, but also successfully drove changes in its 
growth business portfolio into media, IoT/Data and service platforms to become a leading company in the new ICT ecosystem.
In the MNO sector, SK Telecom has put into practice its principle of rejecting wasteful market share competition in 
the mobile telecommunications marketplace, exploring and securing new handset-oriented markets, and embracing a competitive paradigm focused on products and services through which customers can experience value. Particularly in 2017, the company has made its products and services more competitive by substantially enhancing customer value despite the decrease in profits due to pricing regulations, such as raising of the selective contract discount rate. SK Telecom also sought to prepare a solid foundation for stable profit margins due to the steadfast growth in LTE subscribers and demand for data that attracted about 30.195 million subscribers by year-end (including MVNO subscribers). 
In addition, SK Telecom has achieved remarkable performance in the media, IoT/Data, and service platform sectors 
opening new competitive paradigms to become a global new ICT company. SK Broadband, a subsidiary, achieved sales growth of 3.6% YoY and operating profit growth of 56.4% YoY due to the expansion of Giga Internet and IPTV subscribers and increased usage of fee-based contents. Sales in new business sectors increased by 10.8% due to the expansion of revenue in the IoT solution area. In addition, in order to strengthen competitiveness in the rapidly growing artificial intelligent speaker market, the company implemented an AI virtuous cycle strategy that continuously enlarges its service area, contents, and total users, and the number of monthly active users (MAU) of ‘NUGU’ reached 2.11 million as of the end of 2017. These achievements proved the visible potential of the new growth businesses and laid the foundation for accelerating the growth of New ICT.
Maintaining Solid Business Fundamentals and Overcoming Growth Limitations
In 2017, SK Telecom achieved KRW 17.520 trillion in annual revenue and KRW 1.5366 trillion in operating profit according to the consolidated financial statements of the Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS). Despite growth limits in the domestic telecommunications market and pricing regulations, SK Telecom could maintain revenue volume at last year’s level thanks to the efforts to expand handset subscribers and increase in data use, and made a successful turnaround in sales for the first time in three years since 2014 with an increase of 2.5% YoY in the media and IoT sectors. Operating profit increased 0.1% compared to the previous year boosted by growth of media business and profit improvement of the ‘11st.’ Annual net profit increased 60.1% compared to the previous year affected by the increase in the equity method of SK Hynix. In terms of the overall financial performance in 2017, profits increased in MNO despite the impact resulting from price discount policy, and the company’s business fundamentals remain solid because of the positive demand in the media, IoT/Data and service platform sectors and its growth potential has been accelerated. Moving forward, SK Telecom will continue to manage its various business activities so that the quality of the consolidated performance including subsidiaries will improve.KRW billion

2018 FUTURE PLANS AND OUTLOOK
In 2018, SK Telecom will shift its paradigm in the competitive market by securing 5G competitiveness, and will actively 
create results in new ICT areas. SK Telecom plans to achieve operating revenues of KRW 17.5 trillion, which is the same as the previous year on a consolidated basis in 2018.
Telecommunications Business - Earn Qualitative Growth through Innovation in Customer Value
In the telecom business, SK Telecom sets customer value innovation as its priority, and strives to maintain the solid growth of core businesses by differentiating the company’s products and services so that customers can benefit from them. Based on data analysis, the company plans to build a long-term growth base by establishing a distribution network through scientific understanding of each customer and innovating authentic customer experiences. In the context of the customer retention-based, stabilized market competition, SK Telecom plans to expand its base of new net subscribers centered on handsets. By leading the customer retention competitive system, which is quality-oriented and cost-efficient, the company also plans to reinforce its stable profit and growth base to continue the excellent performance of the previous year. In addition, SK Telecom will strengthen competitiveness of wired and wireless infrastructure to provide New ICT services and realize 5G competition initiatives.
Media - Growth as a Leading Total Media Platform Provider 
In the media platform sphere, SK Telecom intends to become the leading total media platform provider through growth in the next-generation media business by strengthening content competitiveness, AI-based B tv evolution, and home IoT growth. SK Telecom has successfully increased IPTV subscribers and revenue, but the company, rather than being satisfied with such achievements, will provide the personalized content based on data analysis, enhance content competitiveness and linkage with the mobile channel “oksusu” and upgrade technology-based home services such as AI and voice recognition. In addition, by expanding the OTT (Over The Top) alliance, the company plans to expand customers’ experiences with the new media businesses and enhance the competitiveness of the media business. Meanwhile, the company continues its growth in sales and operating profit by increasing the proportion of subscribers to premium rates such as giga Internet and UHD broadcasting.
IoT/Data - Leading Digital Transformation by Advancing the IoT ecosystem 
In the IoT platform sphere, SK Telecom continues to strive to lead digital transformation in diverse industries through competitive data analysis and solutions. Following the expansion of coverage of the IoT business and the expansion of the data solution business and security-related home service business last year, the company continues to focus on developing new business models focusing on the energy and smart car business in 2018. Moreover, in order to lead the IoT-era that will start with the 5G era, SK Telecom plans to expand our business into more advanced technologies such as autonomous driving and smart city based on our core infrastructure such as data and AI. Through this, the company will create a virtuous ecosystem based on connectivity between openness and sharing, provide individualized services to business areas that require the IoT ecosystem, and create new value.
Service platform - Expanding shared infrastructure based on AI to secure status as an AI-leading player
In the service platform area, SK Telecom expands the scope to utilize AI as the core shared infrastructure of all businesses and strengthen individual businesses such as commerce to build an integrated offering system for various services. Following the launch of NUGU, the country’s first voice recognition system-based AI speaker, the NUGU mini was introduced last year expanding the device lineup. By improving the quality of voice-recognition services, the company is expanding the number of monthly active users (MAU). Based on this growth, SK Telecom plans to secure five million MAU of NUGU by the end of 2018.SK TELECOM ANNUAL REPORT 2017

5G Service Leadership 
SK Telecom is spearheading technology development with the aim of commercializing the world’s first 5G service, and is mobilizing capabilities by forming the largest 5G task force to develop services that truely impress customers. Following the successful demonstration of 5G data communication based on international standards for the first time in the world last year, in February 2018, two autonomous driving cars communicating with each other, based on 5G technologies, were demonstrated in Hwaseong K-City solidifying its position in the 5G areas.SK Telecom is also developing a 5G end-to-end system that will enhance operational efficiency by providing various 5G services with one universal hardware infrastructure through All-IT virtualization technology.

Based on this competitiveness, the company will develop a new ICT business model for ultra-high speed, ultra-low latency, hyperconnectivity, create new profit-generating models, and lead the 4th Industrial Revolution as a global new ICT company.
Maintaining Balance Between Growth Investment and Shareholder Return, and Strengthening Virtuous Cycles

From 2015, SK Telecom has raised the total dividends to KRW 10,000 per share including an interim dividend of KRW 1,000.

ation through ICT and the future changes brought by the 4th Industrial Revolution were drawn through these processes.

To select and prioritize the company’s material topics, SK Telecom operates a materiality assessment and response process based on stakeholder participation in addition to complying with the guidance on determining material topics and content composition as recommended by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)'s, GRI Standards and the <IR> Framework put forth by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).
Topics related to SK Telecom are managed as an issue pool according to SK Telecom’s stakeholder engagement 
process. Economic, environmental and social topics include global political, economic and social topics such as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), global regulations, mid- and long-term social change trends, topics raised by international organizations and NGOs, and known externalities within the business process.
Based on the IIRC’s recommendations, SK Telecom has selected the following five aspects in its materiality 
assessment process: 1) Topics that may have a continual impact on SK Telecom’s value creation, 2) Topics related to the company’s strategy, governance and performance, 3) Topics that have a significant impact on key stakeholders, 4) Topics that can provide grounds for boardroom discussions, and 5) Topics that may lead to the loss of potential opportunities and risk if not sufficiently managed.
SK Telecom has conducted a three-step Materiality Assessment to determine priorities for material topics. The first 
(M-1) assesses the relevance through a document-based materiality assessment process at the industry-level (peer-to-peer analysis) and at the enterprise-level (SK Telecom’s strategies). The second (M-2) is a more direct process of listening to stakeholder feedback, reflecting the opinions of stakeholders raised by each issue. SK Telecom conducts a survey of stakeholders in this process to evaluate the impact that each issue has on stakeholders. Based on the evaluation results, we have prioritized the impact level by issue. The final (M-3) is a qualitative assessment of the financial impact, assessing the impact of the issue in terms of cost, revenue, and risk and reflecting it in the final issue prioritization. Through this process, SK Telecom selected a total of 11 material topics to report on including two core, four moderate and five relevant topics in 2017.

LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT ISSUESSOCIAL VALUE ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION COMPANY OVERVIEW
1 - New ICT Strategy
ICT, which is the core of the 4th Industrial Revolution, brings innova -
tion into our lives as an intelligent information technology that has a

2 - 5G Leadership
5G is transforming the structure of existing networks through innova -
tion in various areas by making the offline area wireless, connecting people and objects, and collecting and analyzing data through intel -
ligent IoT and artificial intelligence (AI). SK Telecom secures global technology leadership through technology development that enables stable and safe operation of the 5G network. SK Telecom led the stan -
dardization process of 5G core technologies such as network slicing together with global leading players, and the company has succeeded in demonstrating 5G data communication based on international stan -
dards for the first time in the world. Based on these technologies, SK Telecom plans to utilize 5G as a momentum for new business model innovation to enhance customer value through autonomous driving and security, and services that have not been available in the logis -
tics area. In addition, the company continues to pursue efficient 5G network investment strategies to reduce costs such as joint use of indispensable facilities. SK Telecom is committed to leading the 5G technology, the core infrastructure of the next-generation network, for a 'Perfect 5G' network. Please refer to pp.59-60 for more details on the business cases, performance and outlook.
3 - Customer Value Creation
Customers are at the center of corporate growth. Thus, it is important to build trust through customer satisfaction and become a company that grows with customers. As a result, SK Telecom uses the Customer Experience Management (CEM) system, which reflects customer ser -
vice experience in the course of developing products and services to provide customers with a better experience. For example, the company provided differentiated membership services through age-specific tai -
lored consulting services and various alliance programs. In particular, SK Telecom strives to eliminate customer complaints on penalty for breach of contract, roaming charges, memberships, etc., and to en -
hance customers’ experience. Recognized for its efforts, SK Telecom has been ranked 1st for 21 consecutive years in the National Cus -
tomer Satisfaction Survey Index (NCSI), and for 18 consecutive years in the Korea Service Quality Index (KS-SQI). SK Telecom will continue to differentiate its products and services by making customer value innovation a top priority and providing changes and real benefits for customers. Please refer to p.123 for more details on business cases, performance and outlook.4 - Privacy Protection
In step with the growing use of mobile phones, the internet and email services, the issue of customer privacy protection is drawing  keen interest, and the need to adopt stringent policy guidelines and activi -
ties for privacy protection has also increased substantially. The  im -
portance and impact of issues related to the sensitive information that telecommunications companies store, such as location based services (LBS) and demographical statistical data that are utilized by third-party service providers or are directly linked to revenue, are especially expected to increase. Including privacy, the utilization of personal in -
formation that uses ICT is evolving into a human rights issue. SK Tele -
com is endeavoring to prevent human rights violations as related to ICT across all services through a human rights due diligence process based upon the company-wide human rights policy.Please refer to pp. 89-92, 123-124 for more details on the business case, performance and outlook.
5 - Network Quality
Stable network operation and quality control are becoming more im -
portant today with the increase in traffic due to increased data usage, and in the era of 5G where high-capacity content is expected to be consumed. In response, SK Telecom was selected as the fastest LTE service provider in the ‘Communication Service Quality Assessment’ hosted by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning in 2017, proving its unparalled superiority to its competitors. In addition, the company provides differentiated network quality nationwide through technologies applied based on new frequencies acquired. Despite these efforts, on April 6, 2018, a temporary voice and text service failure occurred, causing inconvenience to customers, and the com -
pany compensated customers for the network failure. SK Telecom thor -
oughly checks the entire telecommunications infrastructure to provide better network quality to its customers, and to provide safer and more reliable services. Please refer to pp.59-60, 122 for more details on business cases, performance and outlook.
6 - Social Value
SK Telecom has contributed to economic development and declared 'creating social value' as a mission to thrive with society based on SK Group SKMS (SK Management System)'s management philosophy. As a means of implementing social value enhancement, we are pursu -
ing a Double Bottom Line that measures and manages both economic and social values to achieve sustainable business model innovation required by the times. SK Telecom conducted an environmental profit and loss analysis to analyze the environmental impacts across the entire value chain and to measure the social performance created through products and services through social benefit analysis and to measure the integrated performance as a Double Bottom Line. SK Tele -
com will continue to understand the established role of the company for joint growth with society, communicate about social values with various stakeholders, and enhance the Double Bottom Line. In addi -
tion, we will create a platform for sustainable growth by creating true social values in the process of checking, complementing, and improv -

STRATEGIC DIRECTION 1. STRENGTHENING ICT INFRASTRUCTURE
The strengthening of the ICT infrastructure comprises the enhancement 
of the 5G network as well as AI technology and the innovation of infrastructure. SK Telecom will lay the foundation for the expansion of the ICT business portfolio by strengthening infrastructure to anticipate the New ICT core capabilities. Through commercialization of the 5G network, the company provides personalized data traffic required for MNO, media business, autonomous driving, smart city, etc., and is establishing infrastructure that can respond to user scenarios as a top priority, while the company secures competitiveness in cloud technology that enables efficient storing, management and analysis of data. Exploring new business models by expanding application of AI through development of the apps providing a competitive edge in AI engine technology and comprehensive solutions are the main challenges of the company. 5G is a core factor that will lead all businesses. SK Telecom focuses its energy on securing differentiated competitive advantages through commercialization with stability and safety. In the era of 5G, the company is strengthening its capabilities as a network operator by securing frequencies and standardizing technologies, and building alliances and cooperative relationships with various operators in order to capture new business opportunities. Internally, SK Telecom is forming a company-wide 5G TF to concentrate its capabilities, and is maximizing its internal synergies to develop new business models befitting the coming era of 5G.
STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2. EXPANDING THE NEW ICT PORTFOLIO
SK Telecom is pursuing a new ICT business whose key direction is innovating business models in not only the MNO business but also in the media, IoT/Data and ser vice platform on the basis of 5G and AI, connecting a n d i n t e g r a t i n g t h e m w i t h o n e a n o t h e r, a n d t h e r e b y e x p a n d i n g i t s p o r t f o l i o.  The MNO business will provide core assets for the expansion of the ICT portfolio through customer-based data and the distribution network. SK Telecom will innovate its business models to enhance understanding of the customer and evolve into a integrated marketing company through customer data analysis. In the media business, it is essential to secure customers’ time share by offering distinctive content and innovative technology-based services. Therefore, the company will strengthen its business partnerships to expand the next-generation device-based OTT (Over The Top) platform, while advancing new technology-based services such as voice recognition service and AR to expand the customer contact.As competition in the media market is reorganized focusing on the contents, SK Telecom will expand content investment and provide customized programs using large-scale user data to enhance customer value. In the IoT/Data business area, SK Telecom will secure data solution capabilities based on extensive data collected in smart home/automotive/energy sectors to lead digital transformation in diverse industries. Based on the internalization of insight derived from data analysis, the company is developing a processing technology that can substantially solve the problems beyond the provision of initial solutions, and ultimately creates an ecosystem with a virtuous cycle based on openness and sharing to become a core platfor m provider in the er a of the 4th Industrial Revolution.In the service platform business sphere, SK Telecom will create synergy among businesses through the integrated offerings of various services utilizing AI and big data. The company will streng then the competitiveness of individual businesses by providing personalized services. SK Telecom internalizes content capability, which is the core of media, platform, and commerce business, and leads business model innovation by organically linking the existing e-commerce and O2O (Online to Offline) customer cont ac t dat a collec tion c apabilitie s with the ne x t-gener ation inf r a s t r uc ture.
STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3. CREATING NEW VALUE THROUGH 
SHARING OF INFRASTRUCTURE
Infrastructure such as network, AI, data, and distribution network that 
SK Telecom has built to make an advance as a New ICT Company, is expected to provide new market opportunities such as autonomous vehicles and smart cities in the mid- to long-term. As a result, SK Telecom is transforming and developing its ICT infrastructure and management support infrastructure to an infrastructure shared with affiliates and business partners, thereby improving management performance and corporate value, and creating a wide-range of social value.First, SK Telecom plans to pursue sharing of infrastructure among the MNO, media, IoT/Data and Service platforms. This is to establish a basis for raising the competitiveness in all business areas, rather than implementing business strategies that are focused on specific businesses. For example, the company collects and analyzes customer data through business areas such as MNO, IPTV, and e-commerce which have high customer contracts to secure insight and knowledge about customers, and to create new business models. Furthermore, based on network stability and safety, which are SK Telecom’s major competitive strengths in the era of 5G, the company can expand the base of IoT services such as autonomous driving and health care, creating a cyclical value structure based on data and network infrastructure. In addition, the company plans to mobilize capabilities at the group-level including af filiate s and inve st ment companie s throug h the SK IC T Family(*). The SK ICT Family refers to ICT affiliates within the SK Group including SK Telecom and its subsidiaries. The SK ICT Family intends to enhance the utilization of core infrastructure capabilities among family companies and build a win-win business model through cooperation. For example, it is possible to share business partners of each company, to build a new cooperation system by integrating the purchasing infrastructure, and to seek constructive mutual growth. Furthermore, it aims at promoting sharing of infrastructure with other companies and society to create value in a broader area. The company continues to pursue growth by shifting to win-win frameworks, avoiding unnecessar y competition among mobile operators, which has continued to e x pand our mar ket shar e f or many year s , and e x plor e new profit-g ener at ing structures through capability convergence among different industries. In addition, the company will conduct measurement andvaluation of social and environmental impacts through business, minimize the negative impacts of business activities, and seek ways to maximize positive impacts that contribute to social problem solving. The shared infrastructure defined by SK Telecom refers to the creation of new value by identifying the correlation between segmented ideas and restructuring it scientifically beyond simple sharing. SK Telecom, as a New ICT leader that leads future change, creates integrated value beyond the existing value-creating paradigm and forms a shared and cooperative ecosystem.

c ry p t o g r a p h y  t o  b u i l d  t h e  w o r l d ’ s  m o s t  s e c u r e  5 G  n e t w o r k .   Q u a n t u m  cryptography uses features of quantum mechanics such as indeterminacy and irreplicability to securely distribute encryption keys used for 
communication data encryption to senders and receivers. It uses a 
powerful security technology that prevents attacks on fiber-optic cables and plays a very important role in keeping data we exchange safe.The 5G network will enable a hyper-connected world where 43 billion devices   in  the  world  are  connect ed  wirelessly  with  ‘ safety’  as  its  core competitive edge. In the 4th industrial revolution, data is transmitted at ultra-high speeds to implement self-driving, smart home and smart city services, and data transmission security will be a key competitive advantage for network operators. For this reason, SK Telecom established the Quantum Technology Institute in 2011, and through our continuous 
effort in technological development, we succeeded in developing the 
world’s smallest (5x5mm) Micro Quantum Random Number Generator (MQRNG) chip in 2017. Facing the commercialization of the 5G network and to ensure a more thorough level of security, in February 2018, we have decided to acquire the world’s number one quantum cryptography company, IDQ, a company with the most patents in quantum cr yptography. By strengthening our quantum cryptography telecommunications, SK 
Telecom was able to build a 5G network with the highest level of safety. We 
plan to enhance our differentiated competitive factor ‘safety,’ in the new ICT area, by supplying chips and modules with quantum key distribution and quantum random number generator technology to IoT devices, servers and handsets.The securities industry is evolving into a technology-intensive industry using the new ICT technolog y as its key competitive f actor. The distribution 
rate of domestic security services is relatively low compared to the U.S. 
and Japan, and the demand for security is continuously growing in the domestic and commercial sectors.  There is a demand for change in the securities industry to adapt to trends including the growing number of single-person households, the elderly, start-ups, and unmanned stores. Recently, global ICT companies such as Google and Amazon are entering the industry where growth opportunities are expected to secure growth 
engines.
In May of 2018, SK Telecom entered the security business where high 
growth, profitability and synergy is expected by acquiring a 55% stake and 
management rights in ‘ADT Caps,’ Korea's second largest physical security 
provider with 0.57 million domestic subscribers and a market share of about 30%. Through the synergy between SK ICT Family’s technology and customers with ADT CAP’s security infrastructure, we are aiming to create innovation in the security industry and secure new growth engines.Through the acquisition of ADT Caps, SK telecom created new values by adding new ICT technologies including quantum cryptography 
and will create synergy by providing an integrated offering of mobile 
communications, media and commerce businesses. We aim to change the meaning of security through preemptive risk responses using data instead of the traditional method of providing post-incident responses. As a life partner of our customers and businesses, we will lead the securities industry by providing ‘Safety & Care’ services.

To achieve this, we are combining our inter nal capabilities to build a stable and secure network based on the development of virtualization and intelligence, and we are working with various business partners to create a successful 5G network. ‘Perfect 5G’ can achieve maximum download speeds of about 20Gbps, which is 20 times faster than 4G LTE top speed 1Gbps (as of Januar y 2018), and it can provide high-speed data communication ser vices between 4G and 5G through an organic link with LTE. SK Telecom will continuously develop hyper-connectivity services such as hyper real-time data including augmentation and virtual reality. We will also develop real-time services such as remote robot coordination, self-driving cars, drones, and IoT in face of the revolutionary future that will begin with ‘Perfect 5G’.
Establishing an Autonomous Communication Environment with 5G
SK Telecom is advancing the era of autonomous driving through the development of self-driving technology using the 5G network. We are developing a highly secure V2X (Vehicle to Everything) solution using our network operating capabilities to build a self-driving communication environment and through our partnership with Here, the world’s leading HD mapping company, we are making continuous efforts to improve the quality of ultra-precision maps. In December 2017, SK Telecom and the Korea Safety Transporation Safety Corporation established the world’s first 5G infrastructure in the major test areas of ‘K-City,’ the experimental city for self-driving. In February 2018, SK Telecom succeeded in a joint effort in which two self-driving cars drove using 3D HD maps, 5G vehicle communication and deep learning driving technologies.5G is the key infrastructure for implementing vehicle communication technologies such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-everything communication. SK Telecom will upgrade the infrastructure to make K-City the center of self-driving systems and will open it to various companies and research institutes to establish a joint research institute for industry-academia cooperation to provide the safest self-driving technology.TANGO, Providing the Best AI-based Network Quality
SK Telecom operates a stable network using ‘TANGO’ (T Advanced Next Generation Operations Supporting System) which uses big data analysis and machine learning. TANGO automatically optimizes the network quality based on traf fic information by region and time zone and provides optimal 
responses when network anomalies are detected. In addition, it improves 
network reliability by efficiently responding to network failures with intelligent technologies such as analyzing network conditions in real-time and digitizing and managing the quality of customer experience. Following the application of TANGO to wired networks and to all communication networks using a wireless network in October 2017, we are continuously working to upgrade TANGO’s features to provide the best network quality to our customers.
T-MANO: Establishment of a Virtual Environment through 
Innovation of the Network Structure
SK Telecom uses T-MANO (T-Management and Orchestration), the 
world’s first virtual integrated management platform, for the integrated management of network equipment and software on a single platform, regardless of the equipment manufacturer. T-MANO enables the flexible utilization of resources such as allocating capacit y by region and according to traffic volume. Additionally, it allows system upgrades to be made at once, dramatically reducing the time required to start new services. Using these technologies, we will continue to develop technologies to ensure stable network operation even in emergencies such as disasters and large-scale events.
‘LTE Cat. M1,’ The High-efficiency IoT Nationwide Network
SK Telecom aims to establish a bridgehead in the 5G era, and we are creating a high-efficiency IoT ecosystem by commercializing the IoT nationwide network ‘LTE Cat.M1’ following the ‘LoRa’ network. ‘LTE Cat.M1’ enables low-capacity video, HD photo and voice transmission, and works with the ‘LoRa’ network which is suitable for low-power and low-capacity data transmission to create a perfect IoT network environment. In addition, its power efficiency is ten times greater than the existing high-capacity IoT network technology ‘LTE-M,’ and the low cost of the communication module contributes to reducing the cost of production and the burden of customers. The low-cost and high-efficiency advantage will reduce barriers for manufacturers to enter the market to promote activating the IoT ecysostem.

‘NUGU X Customer Service’
Following the release of NUGU, the first AI service, in September 2016, 
we launched NUGU Mini, a compact version of NUGU which can be used without the restriction of time and space in August 2017. NUGU Mini is ‘portable’ and ‘economical,’ which incorporates the elements customers want in the AI speaker as they have expressed in an SK Telecom internal customer survey. It contains the same functions as NUGU but is less than half the size, one fifth of the weight, and has an internal battery. SK telecom provides services that combine NUGU into various areas to provide a richer AI experience for our customers. NUGU was added to the national navigation app, T map, in the January 2018 update and is provided to customers of all carriers. T map helps to reduce the dangers drivers face when operating the navigation screen while driving and improves safety and convenience for drivers. T map X NUGU experienced an exceptional customer response with over 3 million downloads in 18 days. We are also leading the smart home area expansion by releasing B tv X NUGU, a set-top box that combines IPTV with AI. We will create an AI ecosystem starting with these customer services and the advancement of AI data securing services.  
IoT Services for Enhancing Customer, Social, and Environmental 
Values
SK Telecom provides various B2B and B2C services to create social 
and environmental values through the IoT. Live Care, the IoT livestock management service, enables body temperature monitoring of cattle by injecting bio-capsules into cattle to track signs of disease, estimate optimal insemination time, and identify signs of labor. In August 2017, we launched an air quality managing IoT service to identif y the air quality and fine dust levels in schools and provided air purification and improvement guides to support the healthy school life of children. In December, we launched E2MS (an energy equipment managing IoT service), which provides real-time monitoring and remote control of energy producing equipment while reducing maintenance costs and responding quickly to failures. SK Telecom will expand the scope of customized IoT services tailored to various areas including homes, schools, and workplaces to create more social and environmental values.3. INNOVATION OF BUSINESS MODELS USING SHARED 
INFRASTRUCTURE
Creating Shared Synergy by Combining ICT and Content
SK Telecom will share its business infrastructure with SM Entertainment, 
a leading Hallyu (Korean wave) content business, to combine AI with content to secure future growth engines. The two companies signed a strategic partnership in July 2017 to create a close partnership in the next-generation content distribution business. IRiver, SK Telecom’s audio equipment making subsidiary has abundant capabilities in AI, media, and music devices, and SM Entertainment has the intellectual property rights of the stars it manages, expertise in creating content and the strong loyalty of fans. This partnership will accelerate ICT and content convergence such as AI-based personalized content delivery services and expand our diverging culture and content businesses. For example, we can develop an AI speaker that communicates using the voice of popular singers in Korea to expand our business into foreign markets. By using Hallyu content, we will be able to provide products and services, that combine ICT technology and devices, in tourist areas. SK Telecom will continue to share our business infrastructure with various businesses and  will look for ways to generate synergy in the new ICT ecosystem.
4. SOCIAL INNOVATION, CREATING VALUE THROUGH 
CONNECTIONS
Social Innovation through Start-up Support
SK Telecom established the SK Seoul Campus to gain mutual growth and 
collaborate with start-ups. The SK Seoul Campus is a place many people can freely use to boost the ICT ecosystem and discover potential ventures. In March 2017, we opened a conference room for companies in the campus as well as outside venture companies to develop a human network between start-ups and to promote information exchange. In addition, we will lead social innovation by providing SK Telecom professional consultation services, supporting various infrastructures to promote growth, and activating the ICT ecosystem. Furthermore, we launched the IoT Open House to provide comprehensive IoT solutions for ventures and start-up companies.  The IoT Open House acts as an eco-player that fosters developers by providing comprehensive solutions ranging from product development to the commercialization of services of developers and start-ups and aims to reduce the time required for developing and commercializing services.We are committed to nurturing start-ups at a global level. TIP (Telco Infra Project) is a global consortium involving more than 500 companies that aim to change the way next-generation communication infrastructures are built. It operates TEAC (Telco Infra Project Ecosystem Accelerator), an ecosystem acceleration center that focuses on the innovation of communication infrastructure ecosystems through partnerships and discovering start-ups. SK Telecom is in charge of ‘TEAC in Seoul’ and provides test networks and office space for companies that have been selected in September 2017. Through these activities, we will work with start-ups to pursue the evolution of the next-generation network. 
ICT in Disaster Sites
SK Telecom believes it is important to have network stability with reliable  communication that works even in disasters and rescue situations. As a result, SK Telecom creates public safety solutions and provides body cameras, controlled drones, and T Live Caster video monitoring to 
firefighters to enable them to quickly identify and respond to disasters. 
Additionally, we are conducting research with Hoseo University on underwater station based communication to secure technology in underwater communication, an unfamiliar area of communication. In 2017, we have succeeded in testing the communication technology at Incheon South Port. SK Telecom will share its ICT infrastructure to ensure the safety of customers and society and will work to provide better values. 
Live	Care IoT	Open	House Public	Safety	SolutionsReducing the Digital Divide of Senior Citizens CASE
According to the 2017 National Digital Divide Sur vey conduc ted by the Ministr y 
of Science and ICT and the National Information Society Agency, the average level of digital informatization among the four most disadvantaged groups (persons with disabilities, low-income groups, farmers and fishermen, senior 
citizens) was 65.1%, among which the senior citizens showed the lowest level 
at 58.3%. This digital divide will lead to social class conflicts and widen the income gap. The percentage of elderly people aged 65 and over has increased to 14% of the total population, making Korea an aged society as defined by the UN. This means that the growing number of the elderly and digital divide should be viewed as an issue that needs to be socially addressed rather than viewing it as a temporary problem that is attributed to individuals or families. 
To address this, SK Telecom is operating a volunteer group to educate middle-
aged people on using smartphones. We are also operating ‘T-Maru,’ where we provide overall training for the elderly in local senior citizen centers on how to use applications, Wi-Fi and smartphones. These efforts indirectly contributed to the percentage of smartphone subscribers (a 9% increase compared to 2016) among customers over the age of 60. Our efforts to resolve the digital divide for the elderly will help improve information and communication accessibility, help solve social problems, and positively impact the long-term productivity of SK Telecom’s business model. If the annual average 
growth rate (11.2%) of smartphone subscribers among subscribers over 60 is 
maintained, it is estimated that the percentage of smartphone users over the age of 60 will exceed 90% by the end of 2018. As a result, as of the end of 2017, at least one million feature phone subscribers are expected to change to smartphone subscribers by the end of 2020, and is expected to lead to an annual revenue increase of about KRW 127.4 billion.

SK Telecom pursues a Double Bottom Line which 
simultaneously targets economic and social value 
that will be used in the entire management decision-
making process, as we thrive together with society. 
ISSUE
What are the issues? 
Companies not only need to contribute to economic development, they 
must thrive together with society through social value creation. SK 
Group is building a performance measurement and management system 
based on the Double Bottom Line and is developing a methodology for measuring social value. Through social value measurement, we can 
communicate with various stakeholders and monitor, improve, and 
complement the results to achieve sustainable growth with society.
APPROACH
What is SK Telecom’s approach?
SK Telecom reflects in the company’s philosophy, that the company’s success factors are not only based on short-term performance but 
also through the creation of sustainable future value in consideration 
of stakeholders. We intend to increase value creation through the measurement and performance analysis of social values. Following the 
first measurement of social value using the Social-environmental Profit 
& Loss Statement (SE P&L) last year, in May 2018, we measured more advanced social value in the second year and created a basis for creating 
integrated value. We will strive for stability and growth and achieve 
sustainable growth by promoting social value creation.
VALUE CREATION
How will we create value?
·  Become a leading company in social value creation by improving the 
formalized methodology that measures both economic and social 
performance based on the Double Bottom Line (by 2028)
·  Reduce social greenhouse gas emissions to 650,000 tCO2e through 
T map (navigation service) (by 2020)CREATING FUTURE VALUE BY 
MEASURING SOCIAL VALUE BASED ON 
THE DOUBLE BOTTOM LINE Performance Measurement Based on The 
Double Bottom Line
MEASURING SK TELECOM’S SOCIAL VALUE
SK Telecom has adopted the double bottom line, which simultaneously 
aims to achieve financial per formance such as operational profit and social performance in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. It was also introduced and implemented throughout the management decision-making  system. We set social value as the second bottom line in addition to the single bottom line which only measures and manages financial value. By implementing it in management decision-making, it can create long-term sustainable performance, as it is a fundamental system in which our company can use to thrive together with society.  The SK Group reflects in SKMS, our management philosophy that "companies contribute not only to economic development but also to social development through social value creation.” We use this as a starting point to promote the double bottom line and are leading the social value measurement of affiliates. As a result, SK Telecom measured social value through the Social-Environmental Profit & Loss Statement (SE P&L) for the first time last year. In 2018, SK Telecom strengthened linkage with the double bottom line measurement methodology and measured social value and analyzed social performance.There are social costs and benefits that are not directly derived from the social values that arise from the management activities of the company. SK Telecom strives to calculate the impact of its overall management activities through the linkage with SK Group’s double bottom line measurement method. However, because the social value created by management activities are so extensive, there is a limit to generating comprehensive impacts, and it is difficult to consistently standardize value measurement methods. As a result, SK Telecom plans to build a company-wide social value system and enhance the double bottom line measurement method by communicating with stakeholders.

In terms of handsets, data is collected based on the results of the life cycle 
environmental impact assessment conducted directly by manufacturers on some models of Samsung and Apple’s tablets and smartphones that have the most subscribers, and themthis is converted into the total subscriber range.  SK T elecom provides the optimal route for GHG reduction to users of the T map navigation service. It estimates how much greenhouse gas is reduced compared to the shortest route provided by standard navigation devices and is calculated through social GHG reduction research. However, at the present stage, SK Telecom’s various platform and solution services are limited to the T map navigation platform, EMS solutions and RFID food waste disposal services.
Valuation 
The results of the profit and loss analysis are calculated in monetary values. In the process of applying the social value measurement method, if negative impacts (ex. environmental damage) are expected to be high between the ‘total amount (total amount of environmental impact)’ and ‘relative amount (reduction of environmental impacts of the previous period)', we used the 'total amount' instead of the relative amount. However, for T map, EMS (energy management solution), and RFID (electronic tag) solution services, in order to recognize the environmental impact benefits of clients and consumers as social performances, we used the 'relative amount' for energy saving and greenhouse gas reduction compared to general, and food waste reduction by RFID (electronic tag).

CB WSSK Group’s Double Bottom Line has established economic value, 
financial performance and social values, such as ‘business social performance (primary social performance),’ ‘social performance through social contribution (additional social performance)’, ‘economic social performance’, built with value metrics. In particular, in the social value measurement index, we have set social performances as our primary performance and set social values created through product services as the key role of our company. As a result, SK Telecom produced integrated performances by analyzing the financial performance (net profit) using a social-environmental profit and loss analysis of business social performance as social performances.As of May 2018, the methodology for measuring social values is continu -
ously advancing. In the environmental aspect s, the performance evalua -
tion based on the Double Bottom Line method was not completed; there -
fore, we maintained our estimate based on the reporting methodology EP&L (Environmental Profit & Loss) used in the '2016 SK Telecom Annual Report' published in 2017.1. ENVIRONMENTAL PROFIT AND LOSS ANALYSIS 
SK Telecom's environmental profit and loss analysis uses a step-by-step calculation method to measure the environmental impact of the entire value chain. In order to analyze the environmental profit and loss of SK Telecom, we used three stages: setting the scope of the value chain, collecting data and calculating value.
Setting the scope and data collection 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a value chain category which is divided into buildings, networks, executives, handsets, services and solutions for an environmental profit and loss analysis. Environmental data was gathered through the collection, production, operation, use, and disposal of raw materials. Buildings and networks that are part of the calculation only include the operating phases in which data management is being carried out during the raw material collection, production and disposal phases. We are considering expanding the life cycle range to include the entire range of impacts such as raw material collection, purchasing, production, installation and disposal.

SK TELECOM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  
(*) The figures indicated by the results of 
the socio-environmental profit and loss analysis are the measurement factors of the SK Group's Double Bottom Line method excluding the governance of business social performance, social performance through social contribution, and economic social performance measurement.
1)  Environmental benefits through other services: RFID food waste disposal, T membership mobile card
2)  Prevention of crime through services: U 
relief alerts, Cookiz watch/Cookiz phone, 
LBS-based IoT electronic ankle monitors, text and voice spam blocking system
3)  Improvement of social benefits through mobile and AI services: mobile clinic, NUGU
4)  Social utility of other services: including Happy GPS, Son Nuri/Sori Nuri, communications schoolSetting the scope and data collection
The social profit and loss analysis classifies the results of last year’s traditional market ICT solutions as "social performances through social contribution” but was not reflected in the value measurement of this report. This report focuses on measuring business social performance of 
products and services. As a result, we included 10 products and services, 
that create social value by increasing customer safety and convenience, such as 'Happy GPS' to prevent elderly people with dementia from going missing, 'U-Safe Alert' to prevent crime against children, and 'Mobile Clinic' to reduce the time and costs of hospital visits.
Valuation 
The valuation of the 10 products and services for value measurement was calculated using individual methodologies. Relative pricing was used in cases that were difficult to directly estimate social values. For example, NUGU, an AI platform, uses voice commands to lead to social performances that enhance accessibility to information for the visually impaired. However, as performance cannot be determined through the direct valuation method, we compared the price and performance of NUGU to the screen readers of the visually impaired and set the actual price of NUGU as a ‘reward result’ to measure the value of improved information accessibility. The direct valuation method was applied to the location-based service (LBS) IoT project (electronic valuation) to measure the ef fect of social cost reduction caused by the prevention of crime against women. We have determined the reduction in the crime rate due to electronic ankle monitors, and the resulting reduction of costs caused by crimes was measured as a reduction in social costs.
 
3. COMPREHENSIVE RESULTS OF THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFIT 
AND LOSS ANALYSIS
The results of the social-environmental profit and loss analysis which is 
calculated by combining the environmental profit and loss analysis and social profit and loss analysis are as follows. SK Telecom recorded a net income of KRW 1.3311 trillion in 2017. In the course of business operation, we estimated the environmental impact of buildings, networks, employee business travel, and the environmental impact of the handset manufacturing-use-disposal phase by applying the domestic standard environmental costs to estimate an environmental net loss of about KRW 595.7 billion. Although the environmental total net loss increased due to improved services and more network operating equipment, the environmental loss per unit of equipment has decreased YoY through energy efficiency efforts. We will continuously make efforts to reduce the total net loss in the mid- to long- term.On the other hand, we contributed to the environmental cost reduction of about 93.7 billion KRW through the provision of an optimal route compared to the shortest distance route by using the T map navigation, EMS solution, RFID food waste disposal system and T membership card. In the social aspect, we generated about 17.7 billion KRW in social performances through products such as Happy GPS and U-relief alerts. Based on these measurement results, we have created social values and economic values.  This analysis was excluded in the environmental impacts due to the production and installation of network equipment among the value chain in the environmental profit and loss analysis, and we have limitations of applying only a restricted number of ser vices to the social profit and loss analysis. In addition, the results from the governance item of 'Business social performance', the Double Bottom Line's core social performance, and 'social performance through social contribution' were not included in this report due to externality issues and issues of measuremrnt precision and advancement of the computational methodology. SK Telecom plans to advance its environment profit and loss analysis of the entire value chain and business model, while strengthening its promotion system for social value creation and making a leap forward as a global leader in social value creation.

After the number of mobile subscribers in Korea exceeded 100% 
in 2010, the rate of mobile subscribers continued to rise to more 
than 120% in 2017, and mobile communication has become an 
indispensable and essential asset to our daily lives. As the domestic and global mobile communication business continues to grow, international organizations and academic institutions such as OECD 
(2012)
1) and MIT (2013) are actively conducting research to measure 
consumer and manufacturer surplus in the mobile communication business. As Korea's leading mobile network operator, SKT has 
measured consumer surplus in order to understand the value given 
to consumers through our products and service.
SK Telecom's consumer surplus measurement methodology is based on ‘An Analysis of Mobile Telecomm. Market’s Consumer Surplus and Dead-Weight Cost in Korea’ (Park, Chun-hwan, 
Hansung, 2014). The study calculates consumer surplus through 
mobile telecommunication sales and price elasticity of demand (*), and reflects the Consumer Price Index as a variable over time. Therefore, SK Telecom reflected the Consumer Price Index (**) in 
the consolidated wireless communication revenue and used the 
price elasticity of demand to identify consumer surplus. As a result, the consumer surplus generated by SK Telecom's mobile telecom 
business in 2017 was estimated at KRW 15.7341 trillion.
Consumer surplus is the amount calculated when the actual price is

Therefore, the calculation of consumer surplus implies that customers 
are provided with a higher level of value than the actual amount 
paid for telecommunication rates. We interpret it as the result of SK Telecom’s continued efforts of customer-centered innovation to provide benefits customers can experience.
SK Telecom is committed to providing more effective value to 
subscribers by providing high quality mobile communication services that are reliable, as Korea's leading MNO. In particular, we are making continuous efforts to enhance customer satisfaction by making customer value innovation a top priority in the mobile communications business. SK Telecom will continue to make efforts 
to provide more value and convenience to customers and will 
thoroughly analyze customer data to provide optimal services to each customer to gain their loyalty and trust.

GOVERNANCE REPORT
ESTABLISH LONG-TERM CORPORATE VALUE BY IMPLEMENT -
ING SOUND AND TRANSPARENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCEFurthermore, the BOD of SK Telecom fulfills its roles and responsibilities 
to independently deliberate upon the positive and negative impacts that the company’s decision-making may have on the person with interests to protect the corporate value from a long-term perspective. In 2017, a total of 12 Board meetings were held and the executive directors’ and independent directors’ attendance rate stood at 93.06%, satisfying the minimum quorum. As of December 31, 2017, the average tenure of the board members is 2.5 years.
Corporate Governance Charter
In February 2018, SK Telecom established a corporate governance charter that outlines its corporate governance principles based on its commitment to sound and transparent corporate governance and responsible management. SK Telecom’s corporate governance char -
ter stipulates that the company pursues enhancement of the value of stakeholders including shareholders based on continuous growth and development. Based on these principles, SK Telecom strives to protect the interests of shareholders through the establishment and opera -
tion of a balanced corporate governance structure, and ultimately to enhance future corporate value. The company’s corporate governance charter is consistent with the Korea Corporate Governance Service (KCGS)’s best practice on corporate governance and it can be found on the company’s website.
An Independent and Transparent Board 
SK Telecom is continuing to strengthen the Board’s operation with a focus on independent directors. Currently, the percentage of inde -
pendent directors is 62.5%, which is higher than that of other large corporations in South Korea on average (50.6%, according to the large corporation governance status reported to the Fair Trade Commission in December 2017). Moreover, since 2009, SK Telecom has separated the positions of the Chairman of the Board and the CEO to enhance the independence of the governance structure and after 2012, an in -
dependent director who satisfies all independence requirements has assumed the responsibility of the Chairman of the Board.SK Telecom’s requirements for independent directors comply with do -
mestic Commercial Laws, the Fair Trade Law and other laws, and they are also specified in the Board’s Articles of Incorporation.Additionally, to prevent conflicts of interest, directors are restricted from engaging in transactions pertaining to the company’s business interests without prior approval or becoming a general partner or di -
rector of a company within the industry. In the interests of improving the Board’s efficiency, independent directors and auditors are also limited to holding a maximum of two concurrent positions.
A Diversity- and Expertise-Based Board Selection Policy 
SK Telecom takes the diversity of its employees and stakeholders into consideration and forms a Board of Directors that can represent them. To accomplish this, the company maintains a director selection process in order to actively pursue diversity during the course of nominating and selecting directors in a manner that is free of discrimination based on gender, race/ethnicity or country of origin/nationality. In March 2018, SK Telecom appointed a new female independent director. Thus, out of the total of eight directors, one director is female.Furthermore, through its corporate Articles of Incorporation, SK Tele -
com stipulates that the members of the Board shall have deep exper -
tise and experience in the areas of economics, management, account -
ing, law and telecommunications and execute precise decision-making based on this foundation, thereby contributing to the company’s de -
velopment, risk management and protection of shareholder rights. On this basis, SK Telecom is nominating and selecting as director can -
didates those individuals who are experts and can fill the skills gap vis-à-vis the company’s goals for the Board’s expertise. In particular, by maintaining a certain number of directors with the industrial back -
grounds to make knowledge-based decisions, SK Telecom is focusing its efforts on ensuring skill balance & diversity.Currently, SK Telecom has 8 industrial experts on the Board including 2 executive directors. According to the principles of independence, di -
versity and expertise, SK Telecom’s Independent Director Recommen -
dation Committee may nominate an independent director candidate and if the candidate is given final approval through a majority vote by the Board members attending, the candidate’s appointment may be finalized at the General Shareholders’ Meeting through a transparent and lawful procedure.

The	payment	of	the	CEO’s	performance-based	compensation	of	0~200%	of	the	annual	salary	is	determined	by	a	comprehensive	evaluation	of	measurable	indices	such	as	financial	performance	including	revenue	and	operating	profit	and	
the	non-measurable	indices	such	as	leadership,	achievement	of	strategic	goals,	expertise	and	contribution	to	the	company’s	
management	performance.

Performance Evaluations and Remuneration
SK Telecom evaluates its directors’ performance and evaluations are considered during re-nomination after the end of his/her term, and the remuneration and severance pay for the directors are determined by a vote at a General Shareholders’ Meeting and paid in a fair and transparent manner. 
Each year, SK Telecom conducts a performance evaluation that covers 
the independent directors’ attendance of the Board and the committee meetings, expertise in the company’s businesses and technologies, contributions, how actively they fulfilled their Board activities, etc., and the results are discussed at a Board meeting. When a director is re-nominated by the Independent Director Recommendation Committee after the end of his/her term, his/her previous performance as a Board member is considered. The remuneration of executives, including the CEO, is calculated based on the performance within the limits determined at the Gen -
eral Shareholders’ Meeting. Performance evaluations include external key indicators such as three major customer satisfaction surveys and sustainability evaluation results as well as environmental and social indicators such as greenhouse gas reduction, sales for green solu -
tions, and social contribution solution business sales. When calculat -
ing the remuneration in line with the performance, performance-based compensation of up to 200% of the annual salary is determined by a comprehensive evaluation of measurable indices such as financial per -
formances including revenue, operating profit, share price and EVA and the long-term based KPIs including total shareholder returns, ESG per -
formance and ESG related risk management performance, new Busi -
ness Portfolio and growth drivers by executing new growth strategy. In the interest of enhancing the transparency of management and direc -
tors’ remuneration, including that of the CEO, since 2014, SK Telecom has disclosed the individual remuneration of auditors and directors and auditors whose remunerations were above KRW 500 million within the company’s business reports. 
Meanwhile, in order to enhance the consistency of management’s 
interests and shareholders’ interests, and to provide compensation in a responsible manner in accordance with mid- to long-term performance, SK Telecom provides some of the compensation with stock options. To improve the long-term and ultimate corporate value through strength -
ened responsible management that considers long-term performance and alignment between the company and management’s interests, SK Telecom granted stock purchasing options for 66,504 shares to the CEO in March 2017 and 5,707 shares to three executives in March 2018 through a vote at the General Shareholders’ Meeting.ACCOUNTABILITY

ous sections within the company or may have a serious impact on busi -
ness operations, including a dramatic increase or spread of traditional and social media reports of a certain situation and drastic increases in reports of the same type of customer complaints (e.g. VOC, Voices of Customers) within a short period of time.Such company-wide crisis situations include a nationwide network fail -
ure (incl. failures caused by natural disasters), leakage of customer information, as well as investigations and media coverage of unethical behaviors of executives and employees of the company.

•  There are limits to growth in the saturated wireless telecommunications market 
as demonstrated by the over 48 million smartphones in use domestically and a wireless telecommunications penetration rate of 122.9% (as of December 2017).
•  In addition, flagship terminal specifications that are the main factors causing market competition are upgraded, decreasing demand for the latest terminal, and the replacement cycle is continuously slowing down.  
•  It is possible that the growth trend of subscribers will remain stagnant due to the high domestic wireless telecommunications service penetration rate, which may have a negative effect on management performance. Continual efforts to explore new profit sources and create management results are necessary.Matured
•  Reduction of telecommunications expenses to ease the burden of household telecommunications expenses is one of the concessions that civic groups and political circles have continued to demand.
•  In conjunction with the National Planning Advisory Committee’s Initiative to re-duce household communication expenses announced in June 2017, the company has increased the selective contract discount rate on September 15, 2017, and adopted a plan to reduce rates for low-income families on December 22, 2017. 
The company’s plan to reduce the rate for pensioners passed the review by the 
regulation innovation committee in April 2018, and other relevant discussions are underway. 
•  In particular, adopting a universal rate plan proposed by the government may be the continued risk in the Korean telecommunications market, where the govern-ment substantially determined the rate in the private sector and there are no examples either in Korea or overseas. Matured
•  In order to commercialize 5G, it is essential to develop 5G core technology, including stability and security, as well as to secure frequency that can implement the 5G technology.
•  As global competition for 5G leadership is accelerating, many companies are speeding up the development of new services based on differentiated 5G tech-nologies such as ultra-high speed/ultra-low latency, and many countries including the United Kingdom and the United States are pursuing frequency allocation 
within this year.
•  In Korea, a frequency auction is scheduled to be held in June 2018, and the 
government is targeting the world’s first 5G in March 2019. EmergingSOCIAL VALUE ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION COMPANY OVERVIEW

Increased regulatory risk from 
telecommunications rate cuts
Laying the Foundation for 
5G Commercialization 5G•  Korea’s wireless telecommunications service market is maturing and mobile telecommunications demand is stabilizing.
•  The telecom division’s long-term profitability growth, which accounted for the majority of telecom operators’ operating revenues, is expected to be limited, which could lead to a slowdown in SK Telecom’s mobile telecom growth.•  SK Telecom holds the top market share (48.2%, as of December 2017) through the highest quality data and voice call services, distribution network quality control in data and voice call service, network quality control, enhancement of substantial customer benefit and retention-oriented marketing activities.
•  In order to secure the number of mobile subscribers, the company will set customer value in -
novation as a top priority and lead the qualitative growth of mobile communication by offering differentiated products and services that can give real benefits to customers. The company also seeks the opportunities to expand new revenue through the advanced 5G services.
•  In addition, based on the core competencies of the traditional mobile communication business, such as our subscriber base, infrastructure and data, SK Telecom is focusing on reorganizing its business structure as a provider of new ICT-based services and creating new revenue models in growth areas.
•  Telecom businesses are highly influenced by government regulations, and financial effects such as a decrease in sales of the mobile com-munications business due to measures to reduce household telecom costs and profit damage are inevitable.
•  In recent years, the government’s artificial intervention risks are compromising the overall market competition, while the recent market autonomous competition has strengthened customer benefits and eased their communications expense burden.
•  On the other hand, if rational conclusions are drawn in relation to the introduction of full self-sufficiency of handsets, it will be possible to 
create an opportunity to reduce the inconvenience of consumers and 
to transform the market competition into product and service quality competition and ultimately enhance competitiveness.•  SK Telecom strives to increase the users’ actual benefits by providing differentiated products and services rather than just decreasing the rate.
•  In particular, the company actively adopts special rate systems for low income families as well as the disabled and senior citizens in order to provide indispensable communication ser -
vices to the group with low service accessibility. SK Telecom provides price discount benefits in accordance with the government’s rate-reduction policy. 
•  We are making efforts to create just policies by proactively communicating with the Ministry of Science and ICT and the Korea Communications Commission in relation to the company’s investment capabilities and role in 5G, the core infrastructure of the 4th Industrial Revolution.
•  With the intensified competition for early commercialization of 5G by the global mobile operators, it is expected that the securement of global standardization and frequencies through securing core tech-nologies such as 5G front hall and network slicing will be key to 5G 
competitiveness. 
•  Excessive costs for 5G frequency and investment in network may be 
the risks to the mobile communication operators before 5G related business models are materialized, and there might be unexpected difficulties for Korea in occupying the leading position in the global 
5G market. •  In the case of 5G core technologies, SK Telecom has contributed to establishing international 
standards for major technologies such as 5G front hall and network slicing, and has actively engaged in the global standardization process by demonstrating the world’s first 5G data communication based on international standards at the end of 2017.
•  In the case of frequency, the company plans to secure optimal frequency by comprehensively examining the business model to be developed through 5G, infrastructure competitiveness, and efficient operation of frequency resources.
•  SK Telecom is continuing with its efforts to upgrade and standardize 5G-related technologies, explores new business models realizing ultra-low latency and super connectivity, which are the characteristics of 5G, thus creating a new profit model. 83 84

•  The high-speed Internet network has the nature of a public good, and privacy protection is 
not only the foundation of customer trust but also the basic duty of a provider.
•  Privacy protection is a basic right and legally protected under the Protection of Communi-cations Secrets Act, etc. However, it can also be restricted for the public interest in cases of certain criminal suspects, terror and national security.
•  Wireless telecommunications providers have an obligation to protect customers’ personal information that the company maintains from damages due to hacking, viruses infection, etc.
•   Telecommunications companies have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of per -
sonal telecommunications information. Thus they must establish clear, balanced positions and policies between governmental or political requests for personal information and the protection of customers’ privacy.Emerging
•  As the danger from climate change becomes a major global agenda, climate change regula-tions are gradually being strengthened by enhancing the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). This is therefore giving rise to risks related to securing emissions credits and increased operating expenses from the cost of electricity.
•  The Korean government, following the completion of the post-Kyoto Protocol at the COP21 (Paris Pact) at the end of 2015, set a national target of reducing GHG emissions by 37% compared to BAU by 2030, and is strengthening market and non-market regulations.
•  The government announced its policy of denuclearization in 2017, and announced a road-map to promote new & renewable energy and improve the national energy system.
•  ICT-based business opportunities are newly emerging such as the Next Grid for the greater risk of climate change and improving energy efficiency.Emerging
•  Network neutrality is based on the principle that Internet service providers should allow equal access to all traffic on Internet networks without regard to the users or content providers. In Korea, the ‘Network Neutrality and Internet Traffic Management Guidelines (2011);’ ‘Standards for the Reasonable Management of Traffic on Communications Networks 
/ Transparent Use and Traffic Management (2013);’ and ‘Criteria for illegal acts of imposing 
unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations among the telecommunications providers (2017)’ - are in effect, and telecommunications companies comply with them.
•  There are changes being made to global net neutrality. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a supporter of net neutrality, eased the Net Neutrality Guidelines, while the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) also reviewed the conflict between 5G's characteristics and net neutrality. 
•  It is expected that the Korean government will comprehensively consider global trends and unfold network neutrality policies in the interest of ecosystem development including growth-business related to the 4th Industrial Revolution before commercializing 5G.EmergingRISK & OPPORTUNITIES

Moreover, the use of personal information for criminal investigation purposes is expected to increase further in the future.
•  SK Telecom needs to establish a balanced policy between the efforts to protect the user’s rights such as privacy protection and to cooperate with government agencies, and the company considers it from a long-term risk perspective.•  SK Telecom has established human rights principles for freedom of expression and abuse of technology through formalized corporate human rights policies, and is committed to protecting the rights of users and human rights by protecting personal information.
•  The cooperation for ‘communications data,‘ ‘communication confirmation data,’ and ‘communication restriction measures,’ is carried out according to the strict procedures and restrictions stipulated by the current law.
•  SK Telecom is pursuing zero cases of privacy protection incidents through the company-wide efforts. To protect customer privacy, the company is strengthening the features of the privacy protection control tower and updating the diagnostic system, building a data-based Intelligent Security system, strengthening the wireless telecom-
munication network IT system. The company is pursuing zero accidents of information 
security by strengthening personal and material security systems in accordance with the changes  in the ICT environment. 
•  SK Telecom consumes a large amount of energy across its data centers and networks to operate its networks and base stations, increasing the necessity of capitalizing the externalities from GHG emissions and managing them.
•  There is a need for SK Telecom to be continuously aware of this situation because of the financial burden that the company may have to bear as well as the negative impact this may have on future business operations, such as the environmental liabilities that may result because the amount of emissions 
credit allocations from the government are low compared to SK Telecom’s 
anticipated GHG emissions (BAU) and there are long-term uncertainties in the emissions trading market.•  SK Telecom continues discussions through the Corporate Citizenship Committee of the Board in order to actively respond to the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). In addition to its own greenhouse gas reduction activities, SK Telecom takes diverse actions to mitigate price risk through diversified purchasing of emission credits. These measures 
were recognized through the amounts reduced between 2012 and 2013, and an ad-
ditional allocation of quota was applied for GHG emissions through the purchase of new equipment in 2017.

The ethics pledge and ethics education are regularly implemented for all employees and the needs of new employees/experienced employees/leaders and organizations are reflected to reinforce on-demand education that focuses on raising awareness of ethical management in employees. In 2017, SK Telecom hosted the ethical management practice workshop to enhance employees
’ awareness at all levels at SK Telecom, and the investment 
companies ’ abilities to resolve conflicting and dilemma situations that 
the employees may face in performing actual business activities. SK Telecom spreads its ethical management culture through all business activities by expanding the scope of targets for ethical management education to partner companies, distribution networks and investment companies.

All the employees of the investment companies are subject to surveys on ethical management practice diagnosis, and through a periodical diagnosis once yearly, SK Telecom prevents the company and its employees from being exposed to unethical risks.Following the amendment of the Code of Ethics in November 2017, the Practice Guidelines for the Code of Ethics was amended in January 2018 to strengthen the linkage with the company-wide core values and to divide the ethical practice into ‘Customer - Business Partner - Company - Member - Me.
’ Through this process, we have clearly communicated 
ethical practice messages based on our interests and strengthened our employees
’ awareness of ethical management practices.

In order to preemptively prevent business, management, and ethical risks in field organizations, SK Telecom has developed 27 internal control audit support scenarios based on the SK Group Ethical Management Policy (2015), and carried out sequential inspections on ethical issues. In particular, in 2017, there were 20 of the 27 scenarios developed as automatic inspection items in the ethical management portal to build a self-inspection and regular monitoring system at the organizational level.In addition, SK Telecom regularly conducts ethical management diagnoses and audits to help leaders take the initiative in ethical management and to prevent inefficiencies and potential risks in each of the business areas. In 2017, the ethical management diagnostics and auditing included the diagnosis on the roaming business, management diagnosis on investment companies, iRiver and Entrix, and inspections on field activity expenses of the marketing department, and correctional measures based on the diagnotic results were implemented 100%.
Ethics Counseling and ReportingSK Telecom operates an Ethics Counseling Center to enable regular reporting of ethical management issues and counseling. SK Telecom opens online and offline channels such as a corporate website, in-person counseling and mail correspondence, etc., which are available to all SK Telecom stakeholders including employees, customers and partner companies, who need ethical counseling and reporting. These channels serve not only as a window to report wrongful conduct and corruption, but also as a tool to provide consulting various ethical issues that the stakeholders face.In addition, SK Telecom operates various internal counseling and reporting channels for employees. Employees can use the direct reporting channel connected to the chairman of the Audit Committee whenever they wish to make a direct report.

ing system and the contents discussed, and ensures that the relevant matters are kept confidential so that they are not disclosed against the will of the person concerned. Along with these efforts, in September 2015, the company strengthened the policy of protecting internal re -
porters, stipulated provisions for for the protection of identity, matters consulted and reported by the internal reporter in the Code of Ethics and Practice Guidelines, and introduced a disciplinary action system regarding the leakage of the reporter’s identity.

ance mandatory. The same fair trading compliance standards for sup -
pliers are applied regardless of country or region, and if any supplier disagrees or does not comply with them, SK Telecom will not accept registration as a partner company or will terminate the existing con -
tracts to firmly enforce compliance. 
Anti-Trust Compliance
The SK Group, which SK Telecom is part of, enacted the “SK Compli -
ance System Guidelines” in 2008 and has distributed it to each affili -
ated company to strengthen its fair trade system. SK Telecom has not been involved in any antitrust investigations in 2017 nor did it pay any fines for breaching fair trade practices.

HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTSOCIAL VALUE ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION COMPANY OVERVIEWCOMPANY-WIDE HUMAN RIGHTS DUE DILIGENCE 
AND MITIGATION MEASURES
SK Telecom takes the utmost care to prevent either the company’s direct 
operation or its business relationships from causing any human rights violations. SK Telecom believes that information and communication technologies can promote information exchange and individual access, and enhance social knowledge, openness, and transparency, ultimately contributing to the improvement of quality of life and human rights.  SK Telecom is committed to respecting the human rights declared in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and integrating the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights into the overall business process. Please refer to pp.137-138 for the CEO’s statement on SK Telecom’s human rights policy.
IDENTIFICATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN THE VALUE CHAIN 
AND THE MITIGATION PROCESS
Scope
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide companies and stakeholders with a clear framework to promote human rights in the business operation process. Under the principles of “Protect, Respect, Remedy,” it expects companies to respect human rights, strive to prevent infringements on rights, and actively remove negative human rights issues.SK Telecom introduced a corporate-level human rights policy in 2012, and has continuously strengthened the company’s management in the human rights sector. SK Telecom, through its human rights policy, identified major human rights factors related to the business: 1) the human rights of all the employees and business partners, 2) the protection of personal information and privacy, 3) the rights to access information and freedom event. For example, in the case of conflict minerals, which are the major risks, the SCM office takes responsibility for the regular tasks regarding the issues, while the call center work environment issues are handled by the Customer Value Innovation Office’s Customer Care Team. As such, SK Telecom matches each issue with the responsible organizations for fundamental solutions.
RESULTS OF THE DUE DILIGENCE ON CORE HUMAN RIGHTS RISKS
Conflict MineralsThe term “conflict minerals” refers to minerals such as gold, tungsten, tin, and tantalum mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or neighboring countries, and the fact that armed rebels within the DRC have raised funds through conflict minerals over the past 10 years has brought a major human rights issue in the telecommunications and elec-tronics industries into the public domain. The products that require the most attention in relation to conflict minerals are electronic devices such as mobile phones and notebooks. Although SK Telecom does not manu-facture electronic devices itself, the company identifies the country of ori-gin and conducts due diligence using RBA (Responsible Business Alliance, the former EICC) and the CMRT (Conflict Minerals Reporting Template) provided by GeSI to verify whether the materials, parts, or equipment supplied to SK Telecom contain conflict minerals. The results of the due diligence of the supply chain in 2017 did not show any direct purchase of conflict minerals as well as any direct contractual relationship with the refineries in the disputed area. As a result, no conflict minerals require additional supply chain inspection.
Network Operation Employees’ Working Hours and Safety 
SK Telecom has built and operates 2.79 million base stations nationwide 
for its wireless communication network. In the course of carrying out data processing works and physical maintenance of the network, work
-
ers may be exposed to human rights issues related to safety accidents and working hours. Network O&S, a subsidiary of SK Telecom, has con
-
tinuously managed the occurrence of safety accidents at the company-wide level, inspected the status of the use of safety equipment (hel
-
mets, etc.) and carried out a campaign for safe operation of vehicles. In 2017, SK Telecom surveyed the monthly safety status and identified one major risk. Working hours, one of the global human rights issues, has recently become a major business issue in Korea as it has agreed to shorten the statutory maximum working hours (including O/T work).As the increase in the amount of equipment due to a change in the communication service environment could have led to an increase in the working hours, the company has systemized the registration of work status through the prior permission of the team leader during holidays or night shifts. Through these efforts, the company is constantly striv
-
ing to create a comfortable working environment so that employees can have sufficient rest and work efficiently during working hours.Protection of Service Consultants (Emotional Labor, etc.)SK Telecom has regularly cooperated with its call center subsidiaries to take protective measures by improving the treatment of service consultants and enhancing the work environment. Consultants who are in charge of service counseling are exposed to emotional labor at all times and experience verbal abuse and profanity on an average of once or twice a month. The subsidiary of SK Telecom’s call center is continuously improving its policy to protect service consultants from the negative impact of emotional labor. Major policy includes procedures for understanding (warning), terminating the conversation, and connecting to senior employees (employee protection program) when exposed to unlawful acts such as abusive language, profanity, intimidation, sexual harassment, or to unreasonable demands, etc. Taking effect from April 2018, the company started to guarantee the consultant’s rights to relax by limiting general counseling services (such as fees inquiries) from 12:00 to 13:00 during lunch hours except in emergency cases. In addition, SK Telecom operates its “Mind Care” program, which is a preliminary/follow-up program to understand consultants’ job stress and their response to it through one or more mental health examinations each year, and to continue personal and group consultation for those in high risk. In addition, in order to protect individual freedom and prevent stress, the company has been operating a four-hour work system and a six-hour work system that allow employees to freely choose their working time since 2014.of expression, and 4) the prevention of the misuse of technological services and data. In this regard, SK Telecom conducts a survey regarding whether there are any detailed human rights risks throughout the value chain to which SK Telecom, subsidiaries and business partners belong.
Risk Identification
SK Telecom redefined the priorities of major human rights issues by conducting a Gap Analysis that compares human rights policies with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. SK Telecom’s human rights risk identification procedures include: 1) Research regarding recent human rights issues including OECD guidelines for conflict minerals, 2) tracking of human rights issues from third parties such as Global Human Rights Action Platform and NGOs, 3) annual stakeholder surveys and issue identification and 4) review of integrated grievance resolution content gained through the Board of Directors(Corporate Citizenship Committee) and channel for raising CSR issues.
Establishment of Mitigation Process
Risk analysis for 2017 was led to selection of the following human rights issues: 1) Conflict mineral at the raw material collection stage for network and device equipment, 2) employees’ work hours and safety at the network construction and operation stage, 3) humanitarian treatment and protection of customer service consultants, and 4) personal information protection in the sales and distribution processes. The relief and mitigation measures enable SK Telecom to understand the current status of the identified priority in the human rights issues through due diligence; and to map the dedicated organization for each issue so that the measures can be carried out continuously, and not just as a one-time

Residents’ Land Rights
Telecom companies may experiencethe issue of violating indigenous land rights during the process of constructing base stations and net -
work infrastructures. The risks of violating such land rights by SK Tele -
com is low, as more than 99% of the company’s revenue is generated in Korea, and there is no plan to advance overseas in the mobile com -
munication (MNO) business. When constructing domestic business sites, base stations, and network infrastructures, SK Telecom is conducting preventive reviews to prevent the violation of residents’ rights as well as safety issues such as electromagnetic waves. In addition, SK Tele -
com receives cases of infringement of rights through regular channels (customer centers, etc.) and actively takes action when problems occur.Prohibition of Discrimination in Access to InformationIn this age of high accessibility to the Internet, blocking access of certain groups to the information can lead to restrictions on citizenship and political participation. SK Telecom recognizes that equal access to infor -
mation is a very important human rights issue, and strives for digital in -
clusion through various approaches such as 1) reduction of fees for vul -
nerable groups, 2) improvement of accessibility through education, and 3) network expansion for universal information access. Please refer to ‘Ser vice Accessibility’ on page 121 for SK Telecom’s measures to increase accessibility to information. In addition, SK Telecom supports universal measures (restriction on adult content, blocking illegal content, etc.) to ensure that children can have safe access to online information and responsible content as an important right.

SK Telecom reviews the risk gap analysis and risk mapping results of each supplier at the monthly procurement performance analysis and improvement meeting by comprehensively reflecting the risk factors found in internal risk processes including business partner surveys such as the biannual Win-win Growth Satisfaction Survey, meetings Based on our supply chain policy, SK Telecom provides partner compa -
nies with the ‘Business Partner ESG Code of Conduct’ and ‘Fair Trade/ Transparent Transactions and CSR Practice Agreement’ and requests compliance. As a representative UNGC LEAD company, SK Telecom has reflected UNGC principles in its supply chain guidelines based on UNGC LEAD activities, and refers to the recommendations of GeSI Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) Guidelines, the Global e-Sustainability Initiative. SK Telecom requires partner companies to comply with these principles in the process of signing contracts, and through regular monitoring processes, the company takes various measures such as requesting corrective actions and terminating business relations.
SK Telecom’s Supply Chain Status
SK Telecom designated a “Critical Supplier” group with comprehensive consideration of transaction dependency and impact on SK Telecom’s ongoing business. SK Telecom’s critical suppliers are comprehensively managed and categorized according to 1) the relevance to the compa -
ny’s core businesses and reliability, 2) high level of transaction volume and 3) possession of proprietary technologies for which substitution is not possible. As a result, about 278 out of a total of 1,444 registered partner companies were classified in the Tier 1 critical supplier group.

SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (SK Telecom) considers the percentage of the writ -
ten surveys and on-site surveys carried out for the registered suppliers as a key indicator in ESG evaluation of the supply chain. In 2017, SK Telecom investigated 1,056 first-tier suppliers (out of 1,444 companies) in writing, visited 224 suppliers (including direct visits and interviews with individual companies, and in-depth meetings, etc.) and conducted third-party audits for 60 suppliers, which are equivalent to 93% of total registered suppliers. In addition, 278 companies participating in the company’s mutual growth agreements were assessed by third-party external auditors and evaluators in 2017. We applied these policies and achievements to all domestic and overseas suppliers. Our over -
seas purchases account for KRW 16.8 billion (0.45%) of total purchases (about KRW 3.7 trillion), and regional performance indicators are man -
aged mainly in Korea.Through the electronic contract system (Open2U), SK Telecom has pre-screened all the newly registered suppliers in 2017 through the Fair and Transparent Transaction and CSR Implementation Agreement. Moreover, SK Telecom conducted risk identification and analysis for Corrective MeasuresUsing the diagnosis and assessment results, SK Telecom has established a corrective measures plan for partner companies that need improvement and made efforts to enhance their ESG performance according to the corrective measure plan.Despite these efforts, a total of two companies imposed corrective measures according to the diagnosis and assessment results of partner companies in 2017, and due to the seriousness of policy violations such as violations of fair trade, transparent transactions and occurrence of non-ethical issues, a permanent suspension of transactions were imposed on these two companies.all the first-tier suppliers (1,444 companies) and the second-tier and above suppliers (47 companies) in 2017, for the suppliers identified as being exposed to “high risk”, SK Telecom conducted supply chain audits through a 100% on-site survey or third-party audit to prevent any occurrence of potential risks.Based on the results of diagnosis and evaluation of the suppliers, SK Telecom has provided a capability improvement program and in -
centives to the suppliers with excellent performance. The capability improvement program that SK Telecom provides includes technical support and protection activities such as technology transfer and open collaboration, as well as the SK Win-win Growth Academy, CEO seminars and MBA programs for suppliers, and training for risk reduc -
tion. Training for risk reduction includes training on agreements for win-win growth, purchasing policies and policy compliance, which are provided under the education program for suppliers. More specifically, as the incentives and support programs for the suppliers with excel -
lent performance, SK Telecom adjusts the supply unit price, provides funding (financial) assistance, technical and educational support and welfare benefits.

Procurement Strategy and Supply Chain Sustainability
SK Telecom’s strategic priorities are: 1) securing competitiveness by im-proving its purchasing structure through Total Cost Ownership (TCO), 2) improving cost-efficiency by reviewing the production cost structure from the zero-base perspective, 3) optimizing and improving business-friendly procurement processes, 4) creating an environment for advance procure-ment risk management and fair trade compliance and 5) expanding joint development, supporting exports, and creating a fair trade environment as targets for supply chain sustainability management. In addition, the company is revitalizing strategic integrated procurement through a pro-curement synergy consultative group with SK subsidiaries and investment companies. SK Telecom maximizes the resources of the company and the business partners through the linkage of these corporate procurement strategies and sustainability management targets. At the same time, SK Telecom boldly eliminates unnecessary procedures, formats, and practices to op-timize the process through high efficiency. Achievement of procurement strategies through responsible supply-chain risk management can be demonstrated through the following business cases.SUPPLY CHAIN ESG RISK ASSESSMENT (BY TIER)

BUSINESS CASE 2. 
Purchase amount of  KRW 36.3 billion‘5G-PON’ is a solution applied to the front haul of the wired 
transmission network that connects the building base station unit (RU) such as antennas and repeaters to the integrated base station unit (DU). The era of 5G requires establishing a base 
station that is more compact than LTE. As the data capacity to 
accommodate increases, the front haul that receives and transmits wireless data signals to the DU is becoming more significant. Since 2015, SK Telecom partnered with small giant companies of Korea to develop the 5G-PON, a solution that accommodates the integrated use of 3G, LTE and 5G. It eliminated the inconvenience of building a separate, exclusive wired network each time a new 
network was built, and we are expecting to efficiently spread 
the next generation infrastructures. Using the technological convenience of 5G-PON, SK Telecom expects the time required to build the 5G communication network to be about 20% less compared to building the LTE communication network.
SK Telecom has jointly developed and commercialized LTE and other optical repeaters for mobile communications with partner companies to replace imports of base station equipment. The company has also jointly developed and applied for patents for 
its technologies such as energy-saving optical repeaters and 
transponder enclosure technology to replace the imported goods; and it has supported productivity innovation, partnership business, and the export of ICT solutions. In addition, through a patent grant and joint development, the company exported transmission equipment used for a cloud-based base station in the United States.5G-PON (5G-Passive Optical Network)

Creation and Distribution of Economic Value Effective Tax Rate
SK Telecom generated a total KRW 20.143 trillion in economic value 
including operating income, financial investment income, asset sales income and other profits of KRW 17.5 trillion in 2017 on a consolidated basis. Out of those values generated, the company 
distributed a total of KRW 18.252 trillion to the stakeholders 
considering the future value and investment efficiency of the company, and added the total economic value of KRW 1.891 trillion, which was reserved after all the distributions, to the total amount of capital. 
Meanwhile, SK Telecom enjoyed a total of KRW 34 billion in tax 
credits granted by the government in 2017 for investment in research and development manpower, investment in productivity improvement, and investment in energy conservation.SK Telecom strictly complies with domestic and overseas tax laws and regulations in all transactions which aim at creating economic and social value in order to faithfully carry out liability to taxation and accurately reports and pays the tax amount to be paid in accordance 
with tax laws and regulations. In addition, the company discloses 
related information to stakeholders to ensure transparency in tax payment. In order to ensure the appropriateness of the application of the tax laws, the company is reporting tax amounts to the taxation 
items prescribed by laws and regulations through the accounting firm.
In 2017, SK Telecom’s earnings before tax was KRW 3.403 trillion and the reported taxes amounted to KRW 823.1 billion at a reported tax rate of 24.2%. Meanwhile, the company’s real taxes amounted to KRW 745.7 billion at a real tax rate of 21.9%. During the past two years, the company’s average reported tax rate stood at 24.2% and the real tax rate was 21.4%. The real tax rate in 2017 was 2.8%p lower than 
the reported tax rate. The main reasons for this include the effects 
stemming from tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses, and tax deductions and exemptions. This result is also attributable to changes in deferred income taxes that are not feasible, refunded income taxes from past periods, and the effect of tax rate fluctuations.
Distribution to Business Partners and Miscellaneous Operating Expenses: 
Economic value distributions to business partners and other operating expenses 
for service provision such as the cost of goods sold, commissions paid to 
suppliers, R&D and network investment.
Distribution to Employees:  Wages, benefits and welfare, the reserve for retirement

Distribution to the Government:  Payment of corporate taxes among other taxes

1. 2017 OVERVIEW 
In a wireless telecommunications industry currently defined by fast-paced advancements in the LTE network, we have emerged as the lead -
er in the new information and communication technology (“ICT”) era by launching innovative new products and services designed to meet customers’ evolving preferences and needs.  We aim to maintain our leading position in the Korean market for wireless telecommunications services and actively develop our next-generation growth businesses in Internet of Things (“IoT”) solutions, media and e-commerce and other innovative products offered through our platform services.  We plan to further utilize our big data analysis capabilities to create prod -
ucts and services that are tailored to our customers’ evolving needs, as well as incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities directly into many of the products and services we offer.  We also aim to research and develop cutting-edge 5G technologies that will be adopted as the technological standard for 5G and to acquire the necessary bandwidth to launch 5G services. Our operations are reported in four segments: (1) cellular services, (2) fixed-line telecommunications services, (3) e-commerce services and (4) other businesses. 
Cellular Services
We offer wireless voice and data transmission services, sell wireless devices and provide IoT solutions and innovative platform services through our cellular services segment.  Our wireless voice and data transmission services are offered through our backbone networks that collectively can be accessed by approximately 99.0% of the Korean population.  We maintained our leadership position in the wireless business in 2017 with 30.2 million subscribers (including subscribers of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that lease our networks) as of December 31, 2017, of which approximately 22.9 million subscribed to our LTE service and 23.0 million used smartphones.  Our share of the Korean wireless market based on the number of subscribers (in -
cluding subscribers of MVNOs) was approximately 48.2% as of Decem -
ber 31, 2017 compared to 49.1% as of December 31, 2016.The Korean wireless telecommunications industry is considered to have reached its maturation stage with more than a 100% penetra -
tion rate.  However, with continued advancements in network-related technology, we are able to increase the quality of cellular services we provide to our subscribers. By continuing to be innovative in develop -
ing core competencies, we have firmly established our position as the market leader in wireless telecommunications. We continue to endeavor to strengthen our customer relationships by engaging our subscribers to integrate our service offerings in various aspects of their daily lives such as “T map,” our interactive navigation service which we provide to all users free of charge and “oksusu,” our mobile IPTV service with a wide range of unique media offerings. We also provide bundled subscriptions to our wireless and fixed-line service offer -
ings, and we believe such bundled subscriptions contribute to increased customer retention and acquisition of new subscribers for both our wire -
less and fixed-line services due to convenience.  In addition, we believe our “T Membership” program, our membership service, also contributes to our subscriber retention with the breadth of membership benefits we provide through our membership partners.  We also offer artificial intel -
ligence solutions and in September 2016, we launched NUGU, the first in -
telligent virtual assistant service launched in Korea with Korean language capabilities based on advanced voice recognition technologies.  We have integrated NUGU into our T map service as well as our IPTV service. In 2017, our cellular services segment revenue was KRW 13.26 trillion, repre -
senting 75.7% of our consolidated operating revenue. Fixed-line Telecommunications ServicesWe offer fixed-line telephone, broadband Internet and advanced media platform services (including IPTV) and business communications services through our fixed-line telecommunications services segment.  Our fixed-line telecommunications services are provided by our subsidiaries, SK Broadband and SK Telink.  As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 4.3 million fixed-line telephone subscribers (including subscribers to VoIP services of SK Broadband and SK Telink), approximately 5.4 million broadband Internet access subscribers and approximately 4.4 million IPTV subscribers, with market shares of 16.1%, 25.7% and 13.4%, respectively, based on the number of subscribers.  As part of our initiative to be the leading next-generation platform provider, we aim to provide an advanced media platform with various media content and service offerings.  We currently offer IPTV services under the brand name “B tv” with access to our standard 56 live high definition channels and to as many as 219 channels depending on the subscription service, as well as video-on-demand service providing a wide range of media content, including recent box office movie releases, popular U.S. and other foreign TV shows and various children’s TV programs.  We also offer “B tv UHD,” which is an ultra-high definition IPTV service and has a resolution that is four times as high as the standard high definition broadcasting service in the IPTV industry.  Further, we provide mobile IPTV services through “oksusu” that provides subscribers access to a wide variety of media contents, including various television programs, movies and other video contents that can be downloaded to wireless devices.  Oksusu subscribers have access to more than 90 live TV channels, a wide range of sports contents and popular U.S. and other foreign TV shows, among other contents.  We are also collaborating with media content developers to provide original media content for our oksusu service.  As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 8.6 million subscribers to oksusu.

Our operating revenue in 2017 increased by 2.5% to KRW 17.52 trillion 
from KRW 17.09 trillion in 2016.  This increase was primarily attribut -
able to an increase in broadband Internet service revenue as a result of an increase in the number of IPTV subscribers and an increase in the number of premium IPTV subscriptions with higher monthly rates and purchase of premium video-on-demand content. Another primary reason for the increase was the increase in wireless device sales as a result of an increase in sales of handsets with relatively higher unit prices that were released in 2017. ARPU SK Telecom’s billing average monthly revenue per subscriber (billing ARPU) decreased by 1.3% to KRW 34,901 in 2017 from KRW 35,362 in 2016. These decreases were primarily due to a decrease in revenue attributable to an increase in the number of subscribers who elected to receive discounted rates in lieu of receiving handset subsidies as well as the increase in the applicable discount rate offered to subscribers not receiving handset subsidies from 20% to 25% in September 2017, offset in part by an increase in subscribers that subscribe to our unlimited data usage plans. 
Subsidiaries
The consolidated revenue of SK Broadband, which is mostly generated from its fixed-line telecommunications services, increased by 3.6% to KRW 3.05 trillion in 2017 from KRW 2.94 trillion in 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue from IPTV services attributable to an increase in the number of IPTV subscribers and an increase in the number of premium IPTV subscriptions with higher monthly rates and purchase of premium video-on-demand content.  PS&Marketing’s revenue, which is mostly derived from sales of hand -
sets, increased by 5.1% to KRW 1.77 trillion in 2017 from KRW 1.68 trillion in 2016, primarily due to an increase in sales of handsets with relatively higher unit prices that were released in 2017.SK Planet’s revenue, which is mostly derived from 11st, decreased by 8.0% to KRW 1.08 trillion in 2017 from KRW 1.17 trillion in 2016, pri -
marily due to the spin-off of SK Planet’s former platform and T Store businesses in March 2016. Subscribers & Market ShareThe total number of wireless subscribers in Korea was approximately 62.7 million as of December 31, 2017 with a wireless telecommunications service penetration rate of 121%. Despite the saturated wireless market in Korea, SK Telecom continued to add new subscribers throughout the year, and ended the year 2017 with approximately 30.2 million subscribers (including subscribers of MVNOs that lease SK Telecom’s networks). SK Telecom’s wireless market share based on the number of subscribers (including subscribers of MVNOs) decreased by 0.9%p to 48.2% as of December 31, 2017 from 49.1% as of December 31, 2016. The number of SK Telecom’s LTE subscribers increased to 22.9 million as of December 31, 2017 from 21.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Our operating revenue increased by 2.5% to KRW 17.52 trillion in 2017 from KRW 17.09 trillion in 2016 due to increases in broadband Internet service revenue and wireless device sales, among other reasons. Our operating expense in 2017 increased by 2.7% to KRW 15.98 trillion from 15.56 trillion in 2016, primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization, commissions and labor costs.  As the increase in our operating revenue was almost entirely offset by the increase in our op -
erating expense in 2017, our operating profit increased very slightly by 0.1% to KRW 1.54 trillion in 2017 and our EBITDA margin increased by 0.4%p to 27.3% in 2017 but our operating margin decreased by 0.2%p to 8.8% in 2017. Our profit for the year increased by 60.1% to KRW 2.66 trillion in 2017 from KRW 1.66 trillion.

(1) Labor cost = Salaries + Provisions for defined benefit liabilities
(2) Includes marketing commissions and other commissions(3) Excludes R&D-related depreciation (4) EBITDA = Operating profit + Depreciation and amortization + R&D-related depreciation within R&D expense
The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the 
full year of amortization in 2017 of certain frequency bandwidth usage rights we acquired or re-licensed in 2016 compared to only partial year amortization in 2016 as well as the amortization of our sales manage -
ment IT system software beginning in 2017.  The increase in commis -
sions was attributable mainly to an increase in marketing costs relat -
ing to our wireless service, which was partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs relating to our e-commerce services, the impact of certain value-added tax refunds relating to discount coupons received in 2017 and the decrease in commissions following the establishment of Home & Service.  The increase in labor costs was primarily due to the additional personnel on payroll in connection with the establish -
ment in June 2017 of our subsidiary, Home & Service, which provides in-home customer service primarily to our fixed-line telecommunication service subscribers.  Prior to the establishment of Home & Service, we outsourced these services to a third party vendor and the related costs were classified as commissions.Operating ExpenseOur operating expense for 2017 amounted to KRW 15.98 trillion, representing a 2.7 % increase from KRW 15.56 trillion in 2016.  The increase in operating expense was primarily due to a 5.2% increase in depreciation and amortization, a 2.0% increase in commissions and a 5.1% increase in labor costs.

Operating Profit and EBITDA
Our operating profit increased very slightly by 0.1% to KRW 1.54 trillion in 2017 as the increase in our operating revenue was almost entirely offset by the increase in our operating expense in 2017.  Our EBITDA margin increased by 0.4%p to 27.3% in 2017 but our operating margin decreased by 0.2%p to 8.8% in 2017.  
Non-Operating Income and Expenses
Our finance income decreased by 36.3% to KRW 367 billion in 2017 from KRW 575 billion in 2016, primarily due to a significant decrease in gain on disposal of long-term investment securities to KRW 5 billion in 2017 from KRW 459 billion in 2016, which primarily related to the sale of our 15.0% interest in Loen Entertainment in February 2016 and the sale of our 1.4% interest in POSCO in November 2016, which was partially offset by a significant increase in gain on valuation of deriva -
tives to KRW 224 billion in 2017, primarily relating to the valuation of redeemable convertible preferred shares issued by Bluehole Inc. that we hold, from KRW 4 billion in 2016.  Our finance costs increased by 32.7% to KRW 434 billion in 2017 from KRW 327 billion in 2016, primar -
ily due to an increase in other finance costs relating to management fees paid in connection with our investment in Bluehole’s securities and the loss we recognized on the disposal of our shares of Kakao Corporation, which we had obtained for our 15.0% interest in Loen Entertainment mentioned above.  Gains related to investments in sub -
sidiaries and associates increased 312.4% to KRW 2,246 billion in 2017 from KRW 544 billion in 2016, primarily due to an increase in share of profits of SK Hynix, in which we have a 20.1% interest.  Our other non-operating income decreased by 52.0% to KRW 32 bil -
lion in 2017 from KRW 66 billion in 2016, primarily due to the refunds received in 2016 in connection with the overturn of certain fines previ -
ously imposed on us by the FTC that we had paid compared to no such refunds in 2017.  Our non-operating expenses increased by 15.2% to KRW 344 billion in 2017 from KRW 299 billion in 2016, primarily due to an impairment loss recognized on goodwill related to SK Communica -
tions.
Income Tax
Income tax expense increased by 71.0% to KRW 746 billion in 2017 from KRW 436 billion in 2016 primarily due to a 62.4% increase in profit before income tax.  Our effective tax rate in 2017 increased by 1.1%p to 21.9% from 20.8% in 2016 6.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (SEPARATE BASIS)
SK Telecom spent approximately KRW 1.98 trillion for capital expendi -
tures in 2017 compared to KRW 1.96 trillion for capital expenditures in 2016, each on a separate basis.  Of the amount spent in 2017, we spent approximately KRW 1.13 trillion, or 57.0%, on capital expenditures re -
lated to expanding and enhancing the quality of our LTE network and KRW 387 billion on other non-network related capital expenditures primarily related to developing new products and maintenance and upgrades to our information technology systems. Liabilities We had KRW 15.40 trillion of total liabilities as of December 31, 2017, a 1.4% increase from KRW 15.18 trillion of total liabilities as of December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities.

The number of new employees by age and gender as well as the number of turnover employees is calculated based on the number of permanent and temporary workers (contract based) who have a direct employment contract with SK Telecom. The number does not include employees and officers of the affiliated company and subsidiaries of SK Telecom.SK Telecom’s total newly recruited employees in 2017 decreased YoY, but this was due to the temporary change in human capital caused by efforts to expand human resources in the growth business after the establish -
ment of the new ICT company strategy in 2016. The figures in 2017 show the recruitment has stabilized to the previous year’s level. SK Telecom plans to continue the recruitment of AI, IoT, big data, 5G, and self-driving growth-related personnel focused on platform capacity and to internalize their capabilities. Total turnover in 2017 was 6.3%, down 2.4% p from the previous year. This decrease in turnover rate, which was temporarily increased in line with the transfer of works to subsidiaries/investment companies, happened as the direction of the business became clear and stabilized. SK Telecom con -
tributes to improving work productivity by implementing various welfare systems such as flexible time, childbirth and childcare support, refresh va -
cation for long-term-service employees, and support for single -residence housing.4 SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standard Board)

SECTION 1. HUMAN CAPITAL
1.1 Total Employment
Total employment is one of the key indicators that show a company’s job creation. The total number of employees includes permanent and temporary (contract-based) employees who have a direct employment contract with SK Telecom, except the employees and executives of the affiliated companies and subsidiaries of SK Telecom. We have made efforts to secure early growth engines and internalize human resources with expertise; and as a result, as of the end of 2017, the total number of employees has increased by 2.59% to 4,516 persons.The ratio of female employees, which is a major diversity indicator, increased by 0.4% p from the previous year to 14.3% in 2017, and the ratio of female managers is steadily increasing to 11.1%. By age, the ratio of persons over 30 years and under 50 is the highest, and the ratio of permanent employees is 97.5%, which is similar to the previous year.SK Telecom applies additional points to the vulnerable class to expand the employment of minorities, and implements its Special Screening System for the Disabled. In 2017, the number of veterans employed by the company slightly decreased in 2017 due to the decrease in new recruitment. However, the number of the disabled employed remained at 58, similar to the previous year. The total number of overseas personnel including expatriate employees and local employees is 49 and compared to the total number of employees, the percentage of those overseas is low. The percentage of local managers at overseas business locations is 36.4% and after this percentage rose above 30% in 2014, it has held steady at a constant rate.2015 2016 2017

1.5  Employee Engagement
SK Telecom conducts an annual survey of its employees to audit their per -
formance. To audit employees’ engagement level, we examine our employ -
ees’ engagement level every year. Employee engagement is measured by 
the performance of VWBE (Voluntarily & Willingly Brain Engagement), the sense of belonging and pride as a member, and the ‘work reward and fulfilment’ of employees at the end of August. The level of engagement results from the positive response rate for each survey. Many changes have occurred within and outside of the organization, including the appointment of a new CEO and could have hindered employee engagement in 2017. How -
ever, due to the executives, including the CEO, driving change for growth based on consistent messages on business, members and culture, em -
ployee engagement levels were similar to those of previous years. A total of 2,727 employees responded to the Employee Engagement Survey in 2017. The results of the survey showed 88% of employee engagement.

SK Telecom currently operates a diverse range of programs to improve em -
ployees’ health and well-being including creating a pleasant working envi -
ronment by maintaining a suitable temperature, humidity, lighting intensity and noise level in the office. The company also supports employees so that 
they can manage their mental health including physical fitness and stress 
levels by operating an in-house physical fitness space called ‘Actium’ and Ki Training. Furthermore, to help employees to enjoy a flexible work environ -
ment, SK Telecom has introduced a flexible time system and a system for pregnant women to telecommute. The company is making great efforts to ensure employees’ work life balance by providing maternity and parental leaves beyond what is legally required and aiding employees in raising their children. Starting in April 2018, we have introduced a two-week work shift 
system and Super Friday (end of work shift on the third Friday of every 
month at 3:00 pm), to improve employees’ work life balance.  Based on the Health-On Index, the health index of 2017, the average health age decreased one year from 42 to 41 years of age, and the average health score increased 2.1 points  from 71.9 points to 74 points. On the other hand, we found obesity, diet imbalance and lack of activity to be health risks, and we plan to improve them through online and offline health coaching.1.3 Maternity and Parental LeaveSK Telecom actively implements policies to support and ease the burden of childbirth and childcare of employees. SK Telecom has established sys -
tems to reduce the workload of employees and to prevent disadvantages in evaluation such as maternity and parental leave as well as a shortened working-hour system during the pregnancy and child-raising period, and the company also provides various support programs such as nursing rooms, congratulatory allowance, scholarships for children, the operation of in-house daycare, flexible work system, and children’s centers. In 2017, the company allowed female employees to work for shortened working hours for the entire pregnancy period, and adopted a telecommuting sys -
tem and a childcare system to strengthen the institutional basis for provid -
ing maternity and childcare support. Parental leave is available for both male and female employees up to one year per child. If female employee uses parental leave in succession to maternity leave, she can be provided the parental leave up to two years(including maternity leave).Despite this support, the rate of maternity leave and parental leave has decreased slightly due to the decrease in the overall domestic fertility rate. However, the ratio of male employees taking child-care leaves grew by 6.2%p to 22.9% yoy, showing steady growth. In addition, the rate of return after parental leave, which is a key indicator of job security for employees taking childcare leave, increased by 4.7% p yoy to 97.6% in 2017.
1.4 Human Capital Improvement
SK Telecom, in the transition to the era of the “4th Industrial Revolution,” which reorganizes the necessity of changing and expanding the human re-source development methods, and thus transferred the Human Resource Development Center to the Cultural Competence Group to overcome the limitations in the traditional human resource development and recruitment processes used in 2017. Based on this, in order to secure the human capital capacity under the ICT environments and the severe competition for secur -
ing human resources, SK Telecom has adopted the following three tasks: 1) New ICT competency development, 2) Tech. Leadership & Culture and 3) Strengthening and Internalization of Competency based on shared/collabora-tive platform.First, for the NEW ICT competency development, the company formed a cur -
riculum development committee composed of experts including professor and researchers, etc. to develop new ICT competency that can be the future growth engine such as artificial intelligence, big data, and Internet of Things, and established the New ICT Academy to train technical experts. In addition, SK Telecom introduced SK MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), which en-able users to learn the latest technology contents conveniently, to create an

direction.In the field of Tech. Leadership & Culture, SK Telecom launched Tech Leader -
ship Training Program and a new ICT Insight seminar to raise business insights and perspectives based on data. In addition, the company plans and operates the business unit modeling incubation (BM Incubation) and Intensive BM Consulting Program to enhance business competency, while launching the Start @ Program, where employees can freely suggest idea and reflect it in the business. As such, the company created a place where employees can find more bold and creative ideas. In addition, SK Telecom has collaborated with universities, start-ups and specialized research institutes to create ecosystems based on sharing and cooperation. In particular, the company has developed and adopted AI curriculum and AI Fellowship through industry-university co-operation to lay the ground for nurturing and growing AI technology experts that have become a national issue. The company also contributed to expand-ing the base of New ICT talent by planning and implementing the AI Sympo-sium and the T-TOC Program, which enable venture companies, start-ups and competitors to share and exchange mutual technologies.Through the implementation of these three tasks, SK Telecom’s total training time per person in 2017 recorded 108 hours, which was 38% more than the previous year. In addition, the number of annual training courses reached 281, which is 2.1 times higher than the previous year, due to the opening of new technology competency programs. Based on this human capital enhancement momentum, SK Telecom will further strengthen the three existing tasks in 2018, and will continue to search for business innovation and growth direc-tions through human resource development.the principles and criteria in advance for compensation/promotion/core talent selection, which have been strongly linked to the relative evalua -
tion score, and has made each organization make autonomous manage -
ment and decisions through an enhanced human resource review session.SOCIAL VALUE ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION COMPANY OVERVIEW
The rate of performance evaluation means the number of employees out of the total number of employees that received evaluations according to the pre-defined performance evaluation system. SK Telecom conducts performance evaluations on all its employees, and recorded 99% of imple -
mentation rate of evaluation in 2017, recording a steady increase trend since 2015. In 2017, SK Telecom reorganized its performance evaluation management system of the employees to ensure substantial improve -
ments in performance and competency enhancement of employee based on mutual collaboration. Firstly, the company completely abolished the relative evaluation of allocation methods and introduced a non-rating performance evaluation based on absolute evaluation to avoid internal competition. In addition, the company moved away from regular/collective performance management concentrated on year-end evaluation, and promoted sub -
stantial performance improvement activities through individualized annu -
al performance management of each task. Moreover, SK Telecom has set 1.6 Labor PracticesSK Telecom actively protects the freedom of association of workers under ILO Conventions 87, 98 and domestic labor laws. Employees and officers of SK Telecom voluntarily form labor unions by freedom of association, and joined the labor unions according to their free choice. As of the end of 2017, the rate of participation in labor unions, which is calculated based on the ratio of current labor unions, is 88.7%, showing continuous increase for the past three years. SK Telecom strives to set up a win-win labor-management culture and improve working conditions for its employees under the framework of maintaining and improving desirable labor-management relationship. SK Telecom and the labor union agreed to leave the matters of adjusting wages to SK Telecom’s discretion in 2017 based on the spirit of mutual respect and cooperation. In order to improve working conditions for employees, SK Telecom has established a TF between labor and management, and increased the allowances for worker who works in the places other than hometown and improved the standard of transportation expenses for weekend work.

SECTION 2. SOCIAL CAPITAL
2.1 Access to Service
SK Telecom’s expansion of service accessibility lays the groundwork for providing even more convenient mobile telecommunications services by securing and maintaining the absolute number of subscribers and expand -
ing mobile devices. It consists of promoting digital inclusion for disad -
vantaged groups including low-income individuals and senior citizens. Ef -
forts to improve service accessibility can potentially lead to the potential growth of the subscriber base and average revenue per user. This may not only have a positive impact on SK Telecom’s future revenue, but from a social standpoint, it improves the quality of people’s lives.The rate of LTE subscribers and the number of 2nd device subscribers are the indicators of mobile Internet access. In 2017, the rate of SK Tele -
com’s LTE subscribers increased 4.5%p year-on-year and was recorded as 75.7%. In the 2nd device space, through the launch of differentiated products that identified customers’ needs including T kid’s phone, T out -
door and T pocket-fi, SK Telecom is leading the market. In 2017, the total number of 2nd device subscribers increased to about 1.02 million while the number of subscribers is is continuously maintained at over 1 million after the 2nd half of 2016.2.2 Network Quality Management
Going beyond the leadership in the MNO area, SK Telecom is moving to become a pioneering operator in the new ICT ecosystem on the basis of its network infrastructure. Offering a high-quality network is the asset that SK Telecom fundamentally values for securing core service competitiveness and to this end, the company is making the appropriate investments in network and is simultaneously pursuing consistent quality enhancement as well as technology development to provide excellent quality network services. 
In 2017, the company’s annual wireless telecommunications network capac -
ity was 45.21 million lines and the total number of subscribers was 30.20 million, so it has 150% of retention capacity. In 2017, the company has continued its upward climb with an increase of 33.4 % compared to the pre -
vious year. SK Telecom responds flexibly to increasing data traffic through accurate forecasting and monitoring of demands and is making every effort to provide the best network service. 
In terms of LTE transmission speed, SK Telecom was recognized as a 
service provider offering the fastest LTE service by the Ministry of Science and ICT’s Communications Service Quality Evaluation. Upon being selected, in 2016, the company was recorded as having transmission speeds that exceeded domestic telecommunications operators’ average speeds and maintains its superiority in call quality compared to other companies. SK Telecom maintains a superior quality of data and voice calls compared to other providers, as demonstrated by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning’s recognition of the company as having the fastest LTE service in the Telecommunications Service Quality Assessment and received a higher rating than in 2015. In addition, we provide differentiated communication services by providing superior network quality and coverage compared to competitors through technologies such as 5 Band CA (Carrier Aggregation) and 4T4R (4 antenna technology) by utilizing the 2.6GHz frequency band secured in 2016. After firstly commercializing the LTE-A pro service with a speed of 500 Mbps in the country in 2016, SK Telecom provided service with a speed of 900 Mbps in 2017 and now the company is targeting to secure 1Gbps in 2018. SK Telecom plans to continue providing the industry’s highest level of LTE service quality.In addition, SK Telecom continues to expand service accessibility through the reduction of fee rates for disadvantaged groups. SK Telecom’s to -
tal amount of rate reduction for disabled people and low-income groups aimed at improving information accessibility amounted to KRW 197.9 bil -
lion in 2017, an increase of 3.9% p year-on-year, as a result of the expan -
sion of rate reduction for low-income group which was implemented in December 2017.  In order to ease and resolve the digital divide for disadvantaged groups in terms of access to information, SK Telecom is consistently offering educa -
tion on smar tphone use and ICT education that utilizes its ICT capabilities. Since 2007, together with the SK college student volunteer group Sunny, SK Telecom has operated the mobile phone education program ‘Genera -
tion sympathy! Happy Mobile World’ for senior citizens. Besides this, SK Telecom addresses the smart divide facing different groups by continu -
ously running programs such as the mobile education for North Korean defectors and an ICT Make-a-thon to ease the informational divide expe -
rienced by handicapped youth. We will continue our efforts to increase the ability of the silver generation to use smartphones, by hosting a ‘joint festival’ for senior citizens and by conducting our 1:1 smart phone educa -
tion program, ‘Generation sympathy! Happy Mobile World’. SK Telecom has set its mid- and long-term goal of achieving 17,332 cumulative smart phone education participants by 2020, and will provide convenience and value to more customers to eliminate the ICT information gap. In 2017, the total number of participants in the ICT education for the elimination of the digital divide dropped to 588 from the previous year due to the ter -

To telecommunications service operators, a network infrastructure failure 
has the potential to become a business continuity risk, and if failures con -
tinue to occur, they may even cause a temporary collapse of economic and social systems. Appropriately absorbing the increasing amount of high-level data traffic and maintaining quality while also minimizing the rate of net
-
work failures is one of the major challenges for SK Telecom and all telecom -
munications companies. In 2017, SK Telecom is providing stable telecommu -
nications ser vices by strengthening activities to prevent ser vice failures such as expanding automated service detour solutions and establishing thorough measures as well as automated optimization of network quality and moni

2.5 Privacy Protection
SK Telecom recognizes customer data privacy as a key management issue and is taking the utmost care and efforts to identify and remove potential risks in advance, strengthen and give training regarding information pro -
tection systems, and enhance inspections of distributors and subsidiaries. Since 2016, SK Telecom adopted the Security & Quality Management Sys -
tem (SQMS), which is a companywide dedicated product/ service security management system. The company also designed an infrastructure dedi -
cated to precluding information leakages by completely blocking external access to customer information and only allowing informational access and handling through a virtual secure access site. As a result of SK Telecom’s ongoing privacy protection efforts, no single case of customer information leakage from events such as hacking has happened at SK Telecom since 2011. Customer information leakage is defined as an instance of penetra -
tion/breach of SK Telecom’s customer personal information security system through hacking, thus leading to the stored customer personal information being leaked externally. In 2017, we revised and improved SKT’s Customer Information Protection Policy & Guidelines, which can be used as a decision criterion for protecting customer information, reflecting changes in the in -
ternal and external environment regarding customer information handling. In addition, the ‘checklist for self-inspection when dealing with customer information’ was specified and reflected in the work of related parties.2.4 Customer Satisfaction and Customer Safety IndicatorsSK Telecom is achieving improvements in long-term customer loyalty through the Customer Experience Management (CEM), which strives for the highest customer value. In 2017, the company was ranked No. 1 in Korea’s three major customer satisfaction surveys (NCSI, KCSI and KSSQI) and became the first in the country to rank No. 1 on NCSI for 21 consecutive years. According to the internal Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) Survey conducted twice a year by SK Telecom, the company record -
ed 78 points in 2017, proving steady growth over the past three years.
Since 2015, SK Telecom has implemented personal data privacy audits of approximately 3,800 stores in the marketing and solutions areas and is remotely implementing regular assessments of 20,000 distribution net -
work PCs related to information leakage on an annual basis. Continuing from 2016, complete 100% inspections for stores have been implemented in 2017 as well, and data privacy audit in terms of products/services stan -
dards have also been implemented for 131 cases (100%). Furthermore, SK Telecom has diagnosed privacy protection status of 14 investment companies of the company in 2017 and taken corrective measures. The company has also provided guidelines for security activities to protect core assets and selective investment in security system customized for each in -
vestment company. SK Telecom also conducted focused consulting for each of its investment companies to bolster their privacy protection management capabilities using resources that the company retains. In accordance with the Telecommunications Business Act (Article 83, Clause 6) and Protection of Communications Secrets Act (Articles 13), if a governmental agency requests submission of data, SK Telecom coop -
erates in providing the relevant data according to the legal criteria and methods. Every year on a quarterly basis, the company gives a report to the competent ministry and office (the Ministry of Science and ICT), regarding the statistical data about the details provided. Cooperation regarding “communications data,” “communications verification data,” and “communications restrictions” are carried out according to the strict procedures and limitations specified in current laws.

SK Telecom approaches the investment in local communities from the 
perspective of Creating Shared Value (CSV) that creates innovations in social value by utilizing the company’s ICT and infrastructure capabili-ties. Based on this strategic direction, SK Telecom prioritizes creating ICT-based sharing value, providing technology-based platforms for local communities, and minimizing the digital divide.
Creating ICT-based sharing value means activities that support the founda -
tion of society through the fostering of ICT-based social enterprises and start-ups. SK Telecom operates diverse programs such as SK Telecom’s flagship ICT Convergence venture start-up support project, BRAVO! Restart as well as Youth Fly Program, which is a program supporting university students in terms of entrepreneurship/nurturing/overseas expansion, AVS (Agriculture Venture Star) which is a program nurturing venture company expertized in ICT-based agriculture, and 101 Start-up Korea, a program nurturing start-ups which is under operation together with SK Planet. SK Telecom is contribut
-
ing to the development of new growth engines of the company, while at the same time helping to solve social problems by gathering ICT capabilities.In order to serve communities by creating technology-based platforms, SK Telecom has developed and operated a donation platform called GiveU, and a volunteer matching platform, WithU. According to the expansion of the platform-based social contribution culture, the total amount of dona
-
tions through GiveU increased 48.5% compared to the previous year to KRW 300 million. The cumulative volunteer opportunities registered on WithU, which surged in 2016 has come back to the level of previous years with 24,332 cases. Digital inclusion efforts encompass investment activities to increase the level of access to service for groups that are vulnerable to the digital divide including the disabled and senior citizens. Please refer to the 2.1 Access to Service category for detailed information on results.
Through SK Telecom employees’ volunteer activities, the company has been able to contribute to the expansion of the sharing culture. SK Telecom has especially strengthened specialized volunteer activities such as ICT-re
-
lated volunteer opportunities based on SK Telecom’s capabilities and talent donations. This was in order to improve employees’ satisfaction with their volunteer experiences and also to enhance the efficiency of the volunteer programs. The rate of specialized volunteer activities has been calculated by dividing the volunteer hours performed by the ICT volunteer and pro-bono volunteer groups by the total number of volunteer hours performed. In 2017, the rate of specialized volunteer work decreased as the physical volunteer activities at the disaster-affected sites including earthquake zone Gyeongju and fire area Gangneung, etc. In addition, SK Telecom is continu
-
ing investment to maintain philanthropy programs such as Make-a-thon for the disabled youth, support for Happy GPS and Happy Library, etc.  2.10 Public Policy ParticipationSK Telecom abides by domestic political funding laws that prohibit corporations or organizations from donating political funds. We do not provide any political funding, including political funds, election funds for specific political groups, and lobbying funds of political par -
ties. We are cooperating for the development of the public interest by supporting organizations with guaranteed political neutrality. We also recognize that expenses associated with policy impacts can be a po -
tential risk to the company’s mid- to long-term business perspectives and manage the history and size of donations from the perspective of the entire company. In February 2017, the Board of Directors revised the rules to enhance the fairness and transparency of the execution of expenses that could affect business policies by strengthening the pre-approval process through the Board of Directors’ decision on do -

SK Telecom’s GHG emissions are calculated based on the company’s main 28 buildings including data centers and the guidelines on preparing and managing the statements for the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The scope of this calculation includes emissions from all the network facilities (base stations and equipment), but it does not include emissions from subsidiaries and supply chains. Greenhouse gas intensity, on the other hand, is calculated by dividing the total emissions of greenhouse gas by SK Telecom’s parent-only revenues (data coverage). In 2017, SK Telecom’s total GHG emissions amounted to 875,401 tCO
2e, a 5.7% increase from 
the previous year. This was primarily a result of an increase in power consumption due to the new establishment of more network equipment. Regarding direct GHG emissions, SK Telecom successfully reduced this amount by 4.6%. To reduce GHG emissions, the company put forth a vari -
ety of efforts including the integration of network equipment at the base stations, replacement of worn-out air conditioners and the adjustment of air-conditioning and heating. However, the amount of emissions reduced was small compared to the total amount that increased, resulting in an overall increase in emissions. SK Telecom have set a mid- and long-term target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 82.41tCO
2e per KRW billion by 2020. To achieve this 
target, SK Telecom has plans to discover and implement reduction ac -
tivities such as the use of high-efficiency repeaters and integrated man -
agement of base stations. At the same time, by securing carbon offsets based on the SK’s proprietary technologies and solutions, SK Telecom will actively participate in the Emissions Trading 
Scheme.127 128
SK Telecom is expanding the management scope of indirect GHG emis -
sions (Scope 3) through research on social GHG emissions reduction and 
provision of environmental solutions utilizing ITC. Reducing social GHGs refers to reducing the GHG emissions that result from the activities of daily life using SK Telecom’s ICT services. As part of SK Telecom’s flagship activity to reduce social GHG emissions, the T map navigation service con -
tributes to reducing fuel use and GHG emissions by informing drivers of optimal routes that account for the distance and real-time road conditions between the user’s current location and destination. The volume of social GHGs that T map helped to reduce in 2017 is estimated to be about 0.617 million tons annually. Since opening T map and making it free to use, the number of users has been steadily climbing and given the increase rate of registered cars and the spread of the navigation service usage, SK Tele -
com has set a goal to reduce 0.65 million tons of social GHG emissions annually by 2020.SK TELECOM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SK Telecom’s energy consumption is managed in compliance with guidelines on preparing and managing the statements for the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), and the numerical figures are aggregated by entering billing invoices received from energy suppliers into the system. The total energy consumption is calculated by including the consumption from all 28 of SK Telecom’s company buildings, data centers and network facilities (base stations and equipment), but the energy consumption by the company’s subsidiaries and supply chain is not included. The intensity of energy consumption is calculated by dividing the total energy consumption by SK Telecom’s parent-only revenues (data coverage). Regarding energy reduction results due to the use of natural air-conditioning and renewable energy development, the estimated value of measured data of the previous year (2012~2013) has been equally applied to 2017.SK Telecom continuously reduced energy consumption through reduction activities such as decreasing the use of energ y sources for the heating and cooling systems of company buildings, integrating network equipment such as repeaters and base stations as well as replacing worn-out air conditioners. Despite such efforts, the energy consumption in 2017 was 17,983 TJ, an increase by 5.7% YoY due to the installation of additional n e t wor k e qu ipm e n t . For SK Te l e c om , indir e c t e n e r g y c on su mpt ion r e su l t ing  from the use of electricity accounts for 99.3% of the total consumption. Accordingly, SK Telecom seeks to improve energy efficiency by managing company buildings with a focus on innovating network structures and making networks slimmer as well as generating electricity through renewable energy facilities. Taking the increased energy consumption due to investing in 5G facilities into consideration, SK Telecom plans to achieve 28,340 TJ by 2020 in terms of total energy consumption.

Water consumption is estimated based on SK Telecom’s 28 company buildings including data centers, according to invoices for water usage, and the calculated total does not include consumption by subsidiaries or the supply chain. The intensity of water consumption is calculated by di -
viding the total water consumption by SK Telecom’s parent-only revenues (data coverage). As part of efforts to reduce water consumption, SK Telecom adjusted the Seongsu cooling tower drain amount and changed the cooling tower supply water at the Wonju building. Thanks to these efforts, despite an increase in the cooling tower supplementary water required for the ad -
ditional telecommunications equipment installed, SK telecom successfully reduced annual water consumption to 713,744m

3.5 Resources
Through efforts such as electronic billing, the issuance of T membership mobile cards and retrieval of terminal, SK Telecom is creating a solid base for reducing resource consumption during the course of customers’ use of the company’s services. As the company continues to strengthen these efforts, it is putting resource reduction into practice. The total number of electronic bill subscribers includes customers who receive their bills via smart phone, email or MMS. The rate of new sub -
scription indicates customers who subscribed to the electronic billing service among all new annual subscribers. The electronic billing service has the benefits of improved security of personal information and pre -
vented unnecessary usage of resources such as paper, and thus, the number of subscribers to the electronic billing service has increased at a steady pace. As the end of 2017, the total number of electronic bill subscribers reached approximately 22.86 million and since the introduc -
tion of the smart billing service in 2010, the number of customers taking advantage of the electronic billing service has grown steadily. The new electronic bill subscription rate recorded at 87.6% in 2017, indicating a slight increase compared to the previous year.

Since August 2013, SK Telecom has completely replaced the plastic card that was previously issued to customers that subscribed to T membership with a mobile eco-card. It is expected that the use of the T membership mobile eco-card will result in saving 4.88 grams of plastic per customer and reducing 12 grams of carbon emissions from being emitted. This is equal to reducing the use of four A4 size sheets of paper or contributing the volume of oxygen from 40 pine trees.In the past, SK Telecom issued over five million plastic membership cards annually to run the T membership service. Once this entire amount is switched over to mobile cards, the company expects that an estimated 24 tons of plastic resources will be conserved and 55 tons of carbon emissions will be reduced annually. In 2017, T membership mobile card issuance rate was a cumulative 60%. This is a 4%p increase year-on-year and the rate is steadily increasing each year. The T membership mobile card issuance rate for new customers in 2017 was 99% and owing to this, the carbon emissions reduced have been improved.

3.6 Environmental Costs and Investment The environmental investment and cost is estimated on SK Telecom’s parent-only basis. The environmental costs are the expenditures re -
quired to reduce SK Telecom’s environmental impact and improve en -
vironmental performance. The company classifies and calculates such expenditures into categories including costs and taxes paid to save energy and respond to climate change, dispose of waste and recycling waste, provide education and training, and contribute to nature con -
servation. In addition, SK Telecom also implements and tracks green procurement. Green procurement costs encompass the purchase of products with an energy efficiency grade and high-efficiency energy certification, high quality recycled product certification, environmental mark certification, environmental product declaration, carbon perfor -
mance declaration, and low-carbon product certification, but this is not included in the environmental costs.  T MEMBERSHIP MOBILE CARD ISSUANCE RATE

KRW 702 million. The main reasons for the lower environmental costs include decreases in expenses to save energy and respond to climate change. Furthermore, with the installation of new infrastructure equip -
ment, the company recorded a higher level of GHG emissions than the emissions credits allotted by the government in 2017 resulting in purchase of the credits that it lacked as well as an emissions pur -
chase cost of KRW 1.8 billion due to the increase in purchasing costs. Compared to 2015, a year in which green procurement costs greatly increased due to the expansion of the green certification centered on high-price equipment purchases, such costs were reduced to nearly half in 2017, but are on a rising trend overall.Other Disclosures

used for the verification. DNV GL expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity 
may make based on this Assurance Statement. The Board of SK Telecom has sole responsibility for the integrity of the Report. In performing the assurance work, our responsibility is solely towards the management of SK Telecom in accor -
dance with the terms of reference agreed on.
Conclusion
On the basis of the work undertaken, nothing comes to our attention to suggest that the Report does not properly ad-
dress the adherence to the AccountAbility Principles in AA1000APS(2008) nor is prepared ‘in accordance’ with GRI Stan-dards Comprehensive option.  Further opinions with regards to the adherence to the Principles are made below;
The Foundation Principle of Inclusivity 
SK Group announced in 2016 the amended SKMS (SK Management System) which is the group’s management system 
policy. The commitment is clearly addressed to improve the social value of the subsidiaries by upholding one of top management philosophies, “Happiness of Stakeholders” policy. SK Telecom has integrated the policy in the articles of incorporation in 2017 and in the corporate governance charter endorsed in February 2018. SK Telecom has identi-fied 6 internal and external stakeholder groups such as Customers, Suppliers, Employees, Local Communities / NGOs, Shareholders and Regulators. Stakeholder engagement and communication channels are described in the Report. The assurance team has reviewed the process that significant concerns raised by stakeholder is reported to the Corporate Citizenship Committee and reflected in the development of sustainability management policies. SK Telecom tries to create both economic and social values in every management activities which is called the Double Bottom Line policy. SK Telecom provides the value creation story substantiated by the social-environmental profit-and-loss analysis in the Report.
Materiality 
SK Telecom has conducted the materiality assessment to prepare the Report. The issues were pooled by analyzing the 
stakeholder concerns and expectations, business strategy and risk issues and international sustainability standards. SK Telecom prioritized the issues by rating the relevance with business and sustainability aspects and the impact on stakeholders. The prioritized issues were further evaluated in terms of the level of financial impact on the cost, the rev-enue and risk aspects and adjusting weight were given to each issue, which ended up with the final 11 material topics. The assurance team has reviewed the materiality assessment process and noted that the material topics are prioritized from the process as described in the Report.
Responsiveness 
SK Telecom has established a communication process with its stakeholders. SK Telecom has identified by stakeholder 
survey stakeholders’ main concerns and expectations which are integrated into the Report when defining the content of the Report. The Report presents sustainability background of material topics, its management approach, the methodol-ogy on how to evaluate the performance value associated with the selected material topics. The Corporate Citizenship Committee under the Board of Directors approves strategic directions for sustainability management such as customer-oriented management, mutual growth with suppliers, innovation of social value and charity policy, management of business ethics and environmental management. The committee periodically reviews major issues and achievements. In addition, SK Telecom analyzes social values it creates by using SK Group’s Double Bottom Line measurement meth-odology. The assurance team considers these are a meaningful attempt to manage the performance from sustainability management based on economic, social and environmental values created by SK Telecom.  In addition, the opinion on the report quality is as follows;Accuracy and Reliability 
DNV GL has evaluated the adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles as described above by applying Type 1 
methodology. The reliability of the selected data including water consumption, waste volume, and accident frequency rate are tested with Type 2 methodology. DNV GL has interviewed the data owners in order to figure out the data control process and verified the selected data against the relevant documents and records. DNV GL also conducted in-depth review the business ethics management process. Data owners in SK Telecom can explain the source of data and data handling process and demonstrate to trace the consolidated data back to the raw data set in a reliable manner. The assurance team has not noted any intentional error or misstatement regarding the selected data.
Competence and Independence 
DNV GL applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, in accordance with ISO/IEC 
17021:2011 - Conformity Assessment Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory require-ments. We have complied with the DNV GL Code of Conduct
2 during the assurance engagement and maintain indepen-
dence where required by relevant ethical requirements. This engagement work was carried out by an independent team of sustainability assurance professionals. DNV GL was not involved in the preparation of statements or data included in the Report except for this Assurance Statement. DNV GL has provided greenhouse gas emission verification in 2018. In our opinion, this does not affect the independence or impartiality of our work.

sean_h_lee@sk.comPeter HaJack ChoiUk JangHye Seung HanSean LeeJiwon KimTo contribute to resource recycling and environmental protection, SK Telecom 
used FSCⓇ(Forest Stewardship CouncilⓇ )-certified paper, bearing the logo 
carried only by products made using material from responsibly managed forests 
and other controlled sources. The report was printed at a FSC-certified print shop using soy oil ink which drastically reduces the emissions of air pollutants.
The company also participates in the Carbon Neutral Program run by the Korea 
Energy Management Corporation to offset greenhouse gas emissions generated from the pulp and energy used to print reports. Despite the company’s varying efforts to reduce environmental impacts, since the process of making and printing in paper generates pollutants, this Report is published both in print and as an PDF file.
SK Telecom plans on reducing resource and energy use through using more PDF 
files and the official website of SK Telecom that contain a lot more information than in the print version due to lack of space. We encourage our readers to access this Report as a PDF file instead of the print edition and visit the official website to save resources and protect the environment, while accessing a lot more information more conveniently.You can download this Report as a PDF filefrom the official website of SK Telecom(www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html)
