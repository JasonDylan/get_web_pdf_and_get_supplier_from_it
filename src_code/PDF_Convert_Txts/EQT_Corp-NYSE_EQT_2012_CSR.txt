1Message from the CEO
2www.eqt.comDear Stakeholders,
Together with colleagues from across our organization, it is with great pride that we present 
EQT Corporation’s latest Corporate Social Responsibility Report – which, for the first time, was produced based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting guidelines G3.1.
EQT is one of the first energy companies to utilize GRI’s new Oil and Gas Sector Supplement
(OGSS) requirements.  As a leading, Appalachian-based natural gas exploration and productioncompany, it was important for us to take the next step in formalizing our belief in sustainability.While we provide financial performance through our public filings and earnings calls, we are usingthis report to provide a comprehensive overview of our sustainability performance and programs.Managing the impacts of our activities – whether related to safety, environmental, ethical or socialperformance – is an integral part of how we do business.  We strive to set operating standards thatare consistent with our desire to be a continued and welcome partner in the communities in whichwe live and operate. 
Our culture of safety and environmental compliance continues to demonstrate EQT’s commitment
to managing our operations responsibly.  The health and safety of our people and the public remains our top priority.  In fact, for the fifth consecutive year, our lost time accident rate was significantly below the industry average.  We continue to reinforce safety management and trainingprograms across our organization and commit ourselves to keeping one another safe at all times inorder to maintain a zero-injury culture.  
EQT also has a steadfast commitment to the protection of our environment.  We conduct our 
business operations in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner at all times – strivingto preserve and protect the land, air and water where we live and do business.  As outlined in this report, we believe we have a solid track record of environmental performance.  We take great care in finding ways of continuing to minimize our environmental footprint, which includesenhancing our water conservation and recycling efforts.
When considering EQT’s sustainability obligations, we cannot underestimate the effects that 
our business operation have on the financial stability of our Company, our employees, our shareholders, and other stakeholders in the community.  In addition to being a well-run business financially, we provide significant direct and indirect benefits to the local economy, support the infrastructure of our operating regions, and effectively manage the development of our natural gas reserves.
Our success as a company depends on our ability to operate safely, responsibly and collaboratively
to ensure that communities benefit from our activities.  We are proud to share with you some examples of the ways in which EQT takes measures to operate safely and preserve the environment; and also how we strive to enrich our communities through local giving, educationaloutreach and volunteerism.

3EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) is a Fortune 500
investor-owned corporation, headquartered inPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, operating solely in theUnited States.  With more than 1,830 employeesat the end of 2011, we conducted business inPennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky through three primary business units:Production, Midstream and Distribution.   
Overall, EQT has a unique position in the areas
where we do business, as we are one of the few operators that touch every aspect of the oil and gassupply chain.  It begins with exploration and drillingfrom EQT Production, which is one of the largestnatural gas producers in the Appalachian Basin, having  5.4 Tcfe of proved natural gas reserves across 3.5 million total acres – and includes 530,000acres in what is known as the Marcellus Shale play.   The next step is gathering and transporting gas tomarket.  Our Midstream business unit provides gathering, transmission and storage services for ourproduced gas, as well as for various third partiesthroughout the Appalachian Basin.  The final stage is the selling of natural gas.  The Distribution business segment, Equitable Gas Company, LLC (Equitable Gas), is a regulated natural gas distributionAbout EQT

4*As of December 31, 2011www.eqt.comsubsidiary that sells natural gas to more than
275,000 residential, commercial and industrialcustomers in southwestern Pennsylvania, WestVirginia and eastern Kentucky.  
At EQT, we embrace our opportunity to blend
the experience and strength of a century-oldcompany with the attitude and innovation of a start-up.  Our ability to remain nimble in theface of constantly changing issues within thenatural gas sector, as well as the broader energyindustry, has enabled us to expand and growduring the last four years.  It has also allowed usto quickly take advantage of new opportunities,such as the opening of a new regional headquarters in Pikeville, KY that consolidatedand streamlined our southern operations.  Wealso made a few strategic moves by transferringownership of our Big Sandy Pipeline to SpectraEnergy Partners, and selling our Langley, KYnatural gas processing complex to MarkWestEnergy Partners.  The proceeds from these sales helped us further develop our expandinginterests in the Marcellus Shale.
With this rapid expansion, our focus on 
sustainability became more prevalent and moreimportant.  We must continue to develop existing employees for succession planning and future leadership, as well as educate theupcoming workforce to ensure a well-rounded,capable talent pool.  Hand-in-hand is the protection and maintenance of our corporatereputation, which is important not only to employees, but also to our shareholders, and to the members of the communities in whichwe operate.  Having a reputation built on integrity, transparency and respect enables us to grow our business by being welcomed intocommunities seeking new development.
With the constant change taking place in our
industry, we understand how important it is to establish trust among our various externalstakeholders, including state and local electedofficials, community members, media and investors.  Our core activities directly affect thelives, and livelihoods, of thousands of people, so it is imperative that we operate with honesty,fairness and integrity – while at the same timerespecting the economic, environmental and social implications of our actions.  Our internalCode of Business Conduct and Ethics applies toall directors, officers, employees and consultantsof EQT, and serves as guide for ensuring that we
operate responsibly not only from an economicstandpoint, but from an environmental and social performance standpoint as well.  
In addition, EQT’s Board of Directors sets high
standards for all of us.  In a charter establishedby the Public Policy and Corporate ResponsibilityCommittee (PPCR) of the Board, there are defined roles and responsibilities regardingEQT’s compliance with laws, regulations, policies and practices that relate to environmental,health, safety and other sustainability matters.On an annual basis, or more often as appropriate, the PPCR Committee is responsiblefor assessing our performance and making procedural improvement recommendations toEQT management and the Board of Directors. 
Various stakeholders have acknowledged our
high standards and solid business ethics.  EQTreceived recognition as the 2011 Corporation of the Year (National Category) by the WesternPennsylvania Minority Supplier DevelopmentCouncil.  We also received the 2011 NaturalGas Vehicle (NGV) Achievement Award from the Clean Vehicle Education Foundation andNatural Gas Vehicles of America, and the 2010 West Virginia Office of Oil and Gas Reclamation Award (announced in 2011).

As a 100% U.S.-based company, EQT is 
committed to meeting America’s growing demand for clean energy, while continuing topromote safety, provide a rewarding workplace,and enrich the communities where our employees live and work. Compared to otherfossil fuels, domestically produced natural gas is cheap, clean and abundant – which meanslower gas prices for homeowners and businessesin our communities – and is a step in the rightdirection for reducing America’s dependence on foreign oil.  At the same time, we recognizethat our stakeholders have concerns about theprocesses used to extract natural gas and theirpotential impacts to the environment.  EQT'scommitment goes beyond creating new jobsand stimulating economic growth – we recognize a responsibility to identify and answerour stakeholders’ questions and concerns.  Our business operations are subject to various 
federal, state and local regulations relating to environment, health and safety.  Some of the more prevalent include the release or discharge of materials into the environment; the storage,transportation and disposal of liquids and solid and hazardous wastes; the safety of employees and the general public; and the preservation ofhuman health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment.  We strive to meet or exceed all regulatory standards.  By respecting the rights andexpectations of our stakeholders, we work hard to minimize our environmental footprint and enhance the communities where our employees live and work.
Corporate Social 
Responsibility at EQT
EQT is one 
of the firstcompanies to use thenew Oil &Gas SectorSupplement,and based on theguidelinesestablishedby GRI, we arepleased toself-declarethe report to meet therequirements of GRI ApplicationLevel B. 
Corporate social responsibility is at the heart 
of everything we do at EQT.  That is why ourshort-, medium- and long-term strategies fororganizational success include sustainabilitypriorities such as:
Safety as a core value – for our workers,our natural resources and the people inour communities
Environmental and safety compliance –ensuring that our employees and contracted service providers comply withall environmental and safety regulationsand best management practices
Strategic Prevention and Risk Assessment– meeting and often exceeding applicableregulatory requirements, and using industry-leading best management practices to minimize the impact of ouroperations on the environment
Demand for natural gas – converting aportion of our operating fleet to run onnatural gas versus carbon rich gasoline or diesel; helping other operators to convert their fleets and building one of the region’s first compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling stations to help demonstrate the economic advantages;and providing grants to help non-profit organizations convert to natural gas vehicles (NGVs)  
Positive economic impact – providing lasting benefits to our local operatingcommunities by expanding direct and indirect employment; adding direct and indirect economic value; and giving backthrough charitable contributions
We monitor our activities in each of these
areas and have established procedures for ongoing evaluation of our operations to identify potential environmental exposure, ensure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures, and expand stakeholderawareness of our performance.  This report,our first adopting Global Reporting Initiative(GRI) sustainability reporting guidelines, is afurther step to formally integrate sustainabilityinto our organizational strategy.GRI Guidelines –About This Report
This report covers all EQT Corporation headquarters activities, and the Company’sthree wholly-owned business segments: EQT Production, EQT Midstream and Distribution (Equitable Gas) for the period January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011.  
Our 2011 report utilizes the GRI Guidelines 
version 3.1, including the Oil and Gas SectorSupplement.  The GRI Techn ical Protocol – 
Applying the Report Content Princip les – was
used to identify relevant report content, determine materiality, prioritize topics, assessappropriate boundaries, and validate data forcompleteness.  The primary processes to assessthe importance of sustainability topics to EQTand external stakeholders included:
Leveraging internal risk assessment frameworks to identify sustainability risks
Benchmarking the sustainability reportingtopics of other companies, including thosewithin our industry and our customers
Conducting a gap analysis of our prior social responsibility reporting to the GRIG3.1 guidelines and the Oil and Gas Sector Supplement
Analyzing publicly available investor guides and other media information 
We based the quantitative data provided
throughout this report on direct measurements,estimates and calculations, as appropriate,using methodologies based on industry or internationally recognized standards.  
We are proud of our first GRI report, which
builds on the foundation created by our corporate social responsibility (CSR) brochurepublished in November 2011.  In developingthis report, we contemplated the expectationsof stakeholder groups from across all aspects of our business and we would expect each tohave interest in, and potentially use, one ormore portions of the report.  We plan to evolveour stakeholder engagement and materialityassessment processes to build upon this baseline, and will continue to follow applicableGRI standards for future reports.

78The development of domestic natural gas 
resources can deliver tremendous economic andsocial benefits to a community.  However, atEQT, we recognize there is also an unwaveringobligation to protect our natural resources before, during and after the various phases of our development and operating process.   
Our Commitment
Environmental responsibility is a given at EQT and we consider potential effects on air, water, land andindigenous species when making decisions aboutdrilling a well or laying a pipe. EQT has been in thenatural gas business for more than a century and we believe that the development of our natural resources can be done in a safe and environmentallyresponsible manner.  If the unexpected happens, however, we have safeguards in place that allow us to respond quickly and effectively – and we arecontinuously looking for process improvements.  With a focus on strategic prevention and risk 
assessment, EQT created a protocol for the uniquechallenges faced when operating in the MarcellusShale.  The Marcellus Operations Guiding Principlesprovide a comprehensive core of policies, proceduresand practices that form the basis for training and operations within our drilling, completion and production activities.  The principles address activities such as flammable atmospheres, high pressure pumps and equipment, design and operation of temporary surface pits, well control, and the actual design and construction of wells to protect freshwater aquifers and prevent methane migration. These simple, basic and easilycommunicated guidelines reflect our commitment to safety and to protecting the environment.
Environmental Stewardship
99Marcellus Operations Guiding Principles
Flammable Atmospheres Natural gas encountered during the drilling process is vented away from the work
area. During completions and flowback, flammable zones are established in areaswhere natural gas will be vented.  Natural gas liquids produced during flowback are stored in flammable zones during flowback and removed after flowback.
High Pressure Systems All equipment and components used in pressurized systems are appropriately ratedand capable of operating under the maximum rated pressure.  High pressure pumpsand equipment are only used when necessary and appropriate for the task, and areroutinely tested for integrity.
Pit Design & Operation Prior to construction, potential pit locations are evaluated to establish suitability.Pits are engineered and designed to be stable and impervious, and are inspected toestablish that they are constructed as designed.  Inspections are conducted regularlyto evaluate pit integrity.
Well Control We maintain a minimum of two barriers at all times between the open producingformation and the atmosphere.  A responsible person with a well-control certification from an accredited training program is on-site during drilling and completions.  Blowout preventers are tested prior to being placed into service, and remote actuators are maintained away from the rig and not tied to the rig hydraulic system.
Well Design & Construction Wells are designed to protect fresh groundwater and prevent methane migration.Surface casing is installed and the void outside of the casing is filled with cement.  If cement circulation to the surface is not possible for the surface casing, we installbaskets at appropriate depths and then grout the annulus to the surface to create a barrier between subsurface zones.
EQT’s exploration and production operations
are subject to various types of federal, state andlocal laws and regulations.  These include, butare not limited to, the location of wells; drillingmethods; well construction and casing design;water withdrawal and procurement; spill prevention plans; the transportation, storageand disposal of materials; surface usage andproperty reclamation; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and multiple safety requirements.  EQT routinely works to meet, or at times exceed, these various regulationsand requirements so that we are respected as a responsible operator.  
Water Resource Management
It takes quite a bit of water to create a successfully producing natural gas well; however, in Pennsylvania alone, the natural gas industry uses less than 2% of all water used by industries across the state.  In 2011, EQT procured 100% of the water used for production activities from surface water, municipal water or groundwater sources.   
EQT adheres to pass-by flow regulations 
established by state regulatory agencies to determine water withdrawal thresholds necessary to maintain the ecological function ofthe affected water sources, as well as maintainecosystem health and human well-being.  
www.eqt.com10This includes the installation and monitoring 
of stream gauges, the monitoring of existingU.S. Geological Survey stream gauges, and the use of online water withdrawal tools when available.  To limit how much water we withdraw, EQT routinely collects nearly 100% of the water that flows back from completedwells, and re-uses that water at other sites toproduce new wells.  In fact, we reused 16.9 million gallons of flowback water in our Marcellus operations during 2011.  When the water is no longer suitable for productionpurposes, we carefully collect it and send it totreatment facilities that are licensed to properlyprocess the water.  As an alternative, we utilizestate and federally permitted underground injection facilities for safe disposal.   In addition to protecting the environment 
during water withdrawal, we also take greatcare to protect drinking water.  As a baseline,EQT samples nearby groundwater sources to determine the water quality prior to commencingoperational activities. If we find a pre-existingcondition that cannot be resolved, or one thatour production activities may further aggravate,we will investigate alternate locations.  
Once drilling begins, multiple layers of steel 
and cement – known as casings – are utilized to isolate underground freshwater sources fromthe drilling process.  This industry standard procedure is sometimes referred to as triple casing, and it ensures that the materials used to stimulate the flow of gas from the well donot migrate upwards into the drinking watersupplies.  After the well is c omplete, and gas is
flowing, we can also sample lo cal water sources
again and test against our baseline to ensurewater safety and purity.
Well stimulation occurs thousands of feet 
underground, while freshwater aquifers sit justbelow the surface.  The industry term for thisstimulation process is hydraulic fracturing,which utilizes water as the primary ingredient,along with sand and chemical additives.  Duringthe last few years, there has been considerablespeculation about what is in the water we use,why we need these additives, and what impactthey may be having on our natural resources.EQT was one of the first natural gas producersto voluntarily disclose the content of the hydraulic fracturing fluid used at individual well sites.  We publish this information monthlyon our website, as well as on FracFocus.org, an educational website created by the GroundWater Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission.  These disclosures show the general mixture amountsand explain the use of each chemical additive.We also disclose the chemicals used on materialsafety data sheets required by the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration (OSHA), andin our home state of Pennsylvania, we also provide the information to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Spill Prevention

 EQT’s natural gas production operations are water intensive opera-
tions.  100% of the water withdrawals used for EQT natural gasproduction in 2011 was from surface water, municipal water orgroundwater.  EQT did not use any indirectly collected rainwater,or waste water from other organizations, in its operations. 
 EQT fully complies with the individual state and local regulations,
requirements and limitations on the use of water withdrawals ap-plicable to each location where the company operates.
 EQT had no significantly affected water sources of any type, in-
cluding those in designated protected areas or those having biodi-versity value.
 No water sources having value/importance to local communities
were significantly affected, nor were any people or their liveli-hoods affected due to dependence on water resources.www.eqt.comprevention.  Under our Spill Prevention and 
Control Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, we implement stringent training programs, inspection protocols and secondary containmentmonitoring and repair programs for our naturalgas wells and compressor stations.  We designthese site-specific plans, which include detailedphotos, maps, contact information and spill protocols, so we can begin precautionary activities as soon as we detect a spill.  While the industry requirement is an annual inspection,we conduct monthly inspections of our facilitiesand we track the data electronically so we canmake rapid repairs.  
In 2011, EQT reported 56 significant spills, which
we define as any spill that requires notification tostate or federal officials; 95% of those spills wereless than 20 bbls each (a bbl is equivalent to 42U.S. gallons).  To minimize the environmental impacts we use absorbent booms and pads,along with soil excavation, as our primary spillclean-up measures – we do not use chemical dispersants.  Our stringent procedures andprocesses allow us to quickly contain and ultimately remove the contents of each spill.  Coupled with the removal and disposal of 
the clean-up materials, and according to the prevailing federal, state and/or local regulatoryrequirements in effect at the time of the spill,our clean-up measures result in little-to-no impact to the environment or on local communities.  As part of our “lessons learned”process, we follow every incident with an evaluation of the cause of the spill in order to implement corrective action to prevent recurrences.  Through monthly safety and environmental meetings, we are able to extendour employee training efforts by reviewing techniques, protocols, and “lessons learned.”
Air Emissions
EQT’s greenhouse gas management program is now in its fourth year.  The program drivesour efforts to help improve air quality by measuring and assessing our own greenhousegas (GHG) emissions from various aspects of our operations – including production wells,pipelines, compressor stations, and vehicles.We are then able to investigate and implementnew or enhanced practices so that we can further reduce emission levels.  During 2011, weimplemented several GHG reduction initiatives:
11Activity Initiative
Production Operations Convert drill rigs from diesel to natural gas
Reduce duration of completions in Lower Huron Shale
Increase number of flareless completions in Marcellus Shale
Directed maintenance and best management practices (BMPs)

Midstream: 53,762 metric tons CO 2e
Distribution: 2,300,364 metric tons CO 2e
EQT total: 3,313,493 metric tons CO 2e
* Emissions for Midstream, although calculated, 
were less than the reporting threshold.EQT does not capture or report detailed sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and other air emissions for all of its operations,but we are currently exploring options fortracking this data by activity within each statewhere EQT operates.

 EQT gathers operational data and calculates emissions annually to comply with the emissions inventory requirements of 
each state.  
 Formaldehyde, although a HAP , is reported separately and is not included in the total HAP quantity. EQT does not measure or report the following: emissions as an intensity; persistent organic pollutants.  There are no plans 
to measure or report this data in the future as there is no business or regulatory reason to do so.www.eqt.comIncreasing demand for natural gas usage as an
alternative to carbon-rich transportation fuelssuch as gasoline and diesel is another methodof reducing air emissions – and EQT is at theforefront of this initiative.  With the assistanceof a $700,000 grant received from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, EQT opened a public-access compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling station in Pittsburgh, PA in July 2011. 
In conjunction with this project, we began 
promoting the use of natural gas vehicles forfleets, including our own.  With the conversionprogram underway, EQT plans to operate 23% of its fleet, more than 330 vehicles, onnatural gas by the end of 2013.  During 2011, Equitable Gas converted 10% of its fleet, including passenger vehicles, compressor utilitytrucks, meter regulator utility trucks and cargovans – and as of June 2012, had deployed 34NGVs, which in turn reduced carbon emissionsby 20%-30% overall compared to predecessorvehicles.  Strategic NGV transitions take place as conventional vehicles reach the end of theirscheduled use.   
EQT also provided technical assistance to 
several companies in the vicinity of the CNG station, including the Giant Eagle supermarketchain, the Port Authority of Pittsburgh, the City of Pittsburgh, the UPMC healthcare organizations, and U.S. Steel, which are all participating in the transition to natural gas vehicles.  Through the EQT Foundation, we have also helped five Pittsburgh-based non-profits reduce their environmental impactby providing more than $900,000 in grants tohelp them replace existing service vehicles withNGVs.  These grants will enable six new servicevehicles to be on the road by the end of 2012.
We are also exploring the use of natural 
gas-powered drill rigs and completion equipment at our drill sites.  By the end of2012, we plan to have a minimum of one rig converted to liquefied natural gas (LNG), and equipment on another well site will be converted to field gas.Energy Use
To condition spaces for occupancy, the primarydirect source of energy for EQT facilities is natural gas, together with a very limited usageof heating oil.  EQT’s primary indirect source of energy is the use of electricity to conditionspaces for occupancy, lighting, and supportequipment.  To reduce our dependency on electricity, we have upgraded many of our facilities with light fixtures that use motion sensors for automatic shut-off in unoccupiedareas.  We have also upgraded office equipment such as computers, monitors, printers and copiers to automatically revert to power-save mode when not in use.  For example, the illuminated displays on our telephones go into auto-off mode during non-working hours.
Although not quantified, our facilities have 
implemented a number of efforts to reduceoverall energy consumption, particularly as facilities are upgraded and/or exchanged.  Inour newer facilities, energy usage improvementsinclude: better insulation ratings; more efficientequipment, lighting, and furnishings; occupancysensors; and more advanced controls that allow night and weekend setbacks.  For olderfacilities, starting in 2012, we are implementingextensive preventative maintenance programsto provide more efficient operations and ultimately reduce energy use while increasingequipment life expectancy.
The primary fuel sources for our fleet vehicles
are gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas,and other (including ethanol).  We have implemented a number of conservation measures, including mileage and idle time reductions year-over-year, and conversion ofgasoline vehicles to CNG, to reduce the usageof standard transportation fuels.  These effortshave resulted in an annual CO2 reduction of378.6 tons from 2010 to 2011.
1314The nature of our business involves travelling
hundreds or even thousands of miles each day;therefore, one of the largest impacts we have onthe environment is in our use of vehicles.  OurEQT Midstream and Equitable Gas fleet vehiclesuse GPS monitoring systems, in conjunctionwith our work management systems, to moreefficiently route and plan work, resulting infewer miles driven.  These systems also help usmonitor and actively evaluate vehicle idle timesto further reduce environmental impact. 
Many of our EQT Midstream and Equitable 
Gas employees also participate in a mobileworkforce initiative that allows them to reportdirectly to their first job and return home directly from their last job, reducing the overallmiles driven by avoiding unnecessary travel toand from a company facility.  And as mentionedearlier, EQT is transforming its vehicle fleet tooperate on natural gas. From an emissions perspective, each NGV reduces GHG emissionsby approximately 23% compared to standard
gasoline or diesel vehicles.
Other EQT workplace initiatives that reduce 
environmental impacts related to vehicle transportation include:
Offering a flexible work schedule (9/80) that reduces the overall number of employees commuting on a weekly basis by allowing individuals to make an annualelection to complete each 80-hour pay period in 9 workdays instead of 10, withevery other Friday off.   
Encouraging Pittsburgh-based personnel to use mass transit by offering pre-tax payroll deductions for employees who usevan pools or other forms of mass transit
Utilizing web-based meeting services and conference calls to reduce the need for vehicle travel to remote district offices*Gas gallon equivalent  **Calculation includes conversion of kg to tons (approximately 2.2 per kg or 907kg per ton)Reduced Energy Consumption by Vehicles - 2011

Other Environmental Impacts
EQT is committed to conduct its business operations in a sustainable manner at all times – striving to preserve and protect the land,air and water resources where we do business.This includes minimizing surface disturbance,protecting indigenous species, and reclaimingthe land to its original state after drilling activityis finished.  Although EQT does hold leases onArmy Corp of Engineers property, nationaland/or state forest land, and in areas that contain wetlands – none of our 2011 drillingoperations occurred within any of these areas.As a leader in the use of horizontal drilling 
technology, we are able to drill multiple wellsfrom a single pad, thus minimizing our surfacefootprint.  This technology enables us to directionally drill and extract gas without affecting surrounding surface areas.  In addition,we follow all federal and local regulations to ensure the protection of local species.  As an example, in West Virginia we take precautionsto protect the Indiana bat and several species of freshwater mussels found in select streamswithin our operating areas.  Within theseknown areas, we first conduct studies to identify if these species exist in potential drillingor pipeline sites.  If they do, our first goal isavoidance and if that is not possible, we workwith the appropriate agencies to develop andexecute protection plans.  
For EQT’s Pennsylvania operating areas, we 
use the Pennsylvania Natural Diversity InventoryEnvironmental Review Tool (PNDI ER Tool).  Thisonline database enables us to perform a searchfor potential impacts to threatened, endangered,special concern species, and special concern resources in Pennsylvania.  The PNDI ER Tool is a function of the Pennsylvania Natural HeritageProgram (PNHP), which is a partnership betweenThe Department of Conservation and NaturalResources, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy,the Pennsylvania Game Commission, and thePennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.  If thePNDI ER Tool indicates that a project has the potential to affect a particular species, then further agency coordination is required.  This can result in a habitat survey, avoidancemeasures and/or mitigation measures.  We use similar practices in our Kentucky, Virginiaand West Virginia operating areas.

Safety is a core value at EQT.  In our 
safety-conscious culture, we view ALL accidents as preventable, and empower our employees to work toward the goal of zero incidents.   In fact, from the first day on the job, we introduce employees to the importance of safety by providingmandatory training customized to each job function.  EQT also provides state-of-the-art safety equipment to ensure a safer workplace.  In many cases, these measures exceed legal or regulatory requirements. 
Furthermore, attention to safety plays 
a role in our variable pay program, whereby each EQT employee has a performance goal that requires compliance with EQT’s safety policies and procedures. Safety

In 2011, our lost time accident (LTA)rate was 0.47 incidents per every 200,000 person-hours worked.  This was the fifth consecutive year for this achievement, which issignificantly lower than the industry average of0.63.  Our preventable vehicle accident (PVA)rate was less than 1.0 for the third consecutive
year; and our Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) rate in 2011 was lower than in 2010, dropping to 0.70 per every 100full-time equivalent workers.  EQT’s number is significantly below the industry DART averageof 1.15.  Further evidence of our successfulsafety measures is in our total workforce absentee rate, which was less than 5% by region and gender.

With more than 800 companies providing 
specialized services at our worksites, it is essential that we require these organizations to have stringent safety programs in place before they do any work for EQT.  Companiesthat want to perform contract services in theareas of drilling, construction, maintenance and operations must agree to adhere to theEQT Contractor Safety Program.  
This program is designed to make sure 
that contracted service companies and their employees obey the same rigid safety standards that we impose on our own personnel.  Program requirements for all contractors include:
Comply with EQT’s Contractor Safety Program and Contractor Safety Work Rules
Develop and implement safety policies andprocedures (that are in compliance with allapplicable regulations, laws and standards)for its employees, subcontractors andagents
Conduct all necessary inquiries and inspections of the worksite and relevantpremises as often as needed to ascertainwhether any conditions thereon, includingany conditions created by work performedby Contractor or others, may pose any hazards to Contractor or othersEnsure all employees and subcontractedemployees have the necessary training,skills, certifications, tools and equipment tocomplete the job safely and in compliance
Maintain a safe, healthy and clean work environment
Conduct and document daily safety meetings, or similar discussions, on thetasks performed and capture any relevantsafety precautions
Provide a Competent Person, as definedand required by OSHA, who possesses theability to recognize hazards on the jobsiteand also has the authority to correct thosehazards.  Each contractor is required to designate a Competent Person at everywork location
Investigate and report injuries, incidentswith property damage, and near-misses
At EQT, safety is the responsibility of every 
individual.  We demand high standards fromour employees, and expect no less of the companies that perform work on our behalf.EQT investigates all reports of unsafe activity,and takes the appropriate steps to ensure compliance, even if it means not allowing acompany to perform work for EQT.  www.eqt.comEmergency Preparedness 
Outreach
EQT began an outreach effort in 2010 to connect with local emergency responders inareas of past, current and future operations.EQT has effectively presented the Well SiteAwareness Program in 10 counties to emergency medical service directors, fire personnel and 911 coordinators during that first year.  
EQT personnel who attended the Pennsylvania
State Fire Academy training series developedand delivered the program. We based the presentation on EQT’s safety policy in conjunction with similar information from the academy training series.  EQT's intentionwith this presentation is to raise awareness.We relay what to expect when an emergency happens, how to get to a site or incident, associated hazards, construction processes,drilling processes, site layout, completion (hydraulic fracturing) processes and commonsite terminology.  
The presentation leaves emergency responders
with a higher level of comfort regarding whatthey can expect at a well site. They also knowwhat they can expect from EQT, what we canexpect from them, and who to contact shoulda situation arise.  
Since 2010, EQT has worked with emergency
management officials in the following areas:Clarion, Elk, Greene, Indiana, Jefferson, Tioga,and Washington counties in Pennsylvania; andDoddridge, Lewis Ritchie, Upshur, and Wetzelcounties in West Virginia.  We plan to continueour dialogue with these emergency manage-ment officials, and will expand the initiative toother areas as our operations grow.Senior Executive Commitment
EQT has made safety an executive-level responsibility.  For any major incident or losttime accident (LTA), the company conducts acomplete root cause analysis investigation, performed by experts.  EQT’s CEO personallyreviews the incident investigation, the rootcause analysis and any corrective measures implemented to prevent recurrence.  
EQT drives its commitment to safety from 
the top through its Executive Safety Council.On a quarterly basis, this team of EQT seniormanagement meets to review safety performance and continually develop newways to achieve and maintain a world-classsafety organization.  
The EQT Executive Safety Council also conducts
regular field inspections of EQT facilities, traveling to sites throughout the company’sservice territory to perform spot checks on theeffectiveness of implemented health and safetystandards.

America, EQT is a company that plays a dynamic role in the well-being of the broadercommunity to which we belong.

EQT identifies and selects its stakeholder
groups based on recurring contact with, or interest in, the operations of the company.  Just as their interests vary, so do our approaches to engaging their input regardingour activities.  
During 2011, Equitable Gas, our distribution
subsidiary, serviced the majority of EQT’s customers – which includes approximately275,000 residential, commercial and industrialcustomers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky.  By law, the individual publicutility commissions in each state regulate the geographic service areas, rates and communication policies affecting these customers, and Equitable Gas adheres to those requirements.   
We maintain an ongoing dialogue with our
customers to make sure they are aware of regulatory or legislative actions that may impacttheir service.  We provide recommendations to help customers use natural gas safely and efficiently, notify communities of localmaintenance activities, and provide options fortwo-way communication with the Company bymail, telephone or electronically.  To measure the effectiveness of these outreach efforts, Equitable Gas monitors customer satisfaction in the following ways:
JD Power Residential Natural Gas Customer Survey: Equitable Gas (EGC)ranked 11 of 20 among East Region natural gas distribution companies.  EGCwas the fifth most improved company in the entire 2011 study with a 12 point increase in Overall Customer Satisfaction.
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission customer transaction satisfaction survey(results unavailable at the time this reportwas prepared.)
Internally conducted post-call survey
Review of all customer inquiries/ issues received via non-standard channels
Ad-hoc surveys to assess customer preferences; results used in business planning and project prioritizationEQT does not formally survey its wholesale 
customers in the Midstream business, however,those clients have similar opportunities to communicate directly with EQT by mail, telephone or electronically.   
EQT has a number of other stakeholders who,
although not direct customers of the company,also have a vested interest in how we operateand how our activities impact the local and national economy, the environment, and society as a whole.  We engage these stakeholders in a variety of ways to be surethey are receiving the information they need to make informed decisions about ourbusiness, and our role in their communities.  
In 2011, EQT conducted six community open
houses in counties and municipalities where we had significant drilling activity.  The purposewas to connect personally with the residents of these communities and give them an opportunity to ask questions about our operations and provide direct feedback regarding issues of importance to them.  
We also conducted opinion leader interviews,
general focus groups and other types of quantitative and qualitative research to determine key issues and test reactions to marketing communications designed to respond to public questions.  Knowledgegained from these interactions is used to develop appropriate methods to respond tostakeholder concerns and strengthen our own processes and procedures.  
The organization references trade associations
such as the American Gas Association and government agencies such as the United StatesEnergy Information Administration in printedand online materials in order to promote transparent and accurate information aboutthe benefits of natural gas and services.  
Equitable Gas is a member of the Energy 
Solutions Center, which is an organizationcomprised of North American utilities that distribute natural gas.  Energy Solutions Centerprovides strategy, resources, and tools for enhanced sales and marketing success in thenatural gas industry and EQT belongs to numerous trade associations including theAmerican Natural Gas Association (ANGA) aswell as individual oil and gas associations in eachstate where the company has active operations.26EQT Stakeholder Engagement: Addressing Concerns

From our founding in 1888 as Equitable Gas,
we recognized the importance of a local, clean-burning and affordable energy alternativeto coal.  Even then, we were focused on developing safe and reliable ways to delivernewly accessible natural gas to the cities andtowns of southwestern Pennsylvania that werespringing up to support the workers in the region’s burgeoning industrial base.  We werealso building the foundation of internal and external social responsibility that has sustainedEQT as a vital asset to the regions where we operate.  As EQT grew over the years, so didour commitment to the neighborhoods thatplayed an important role in sustaining our business.  In addition to our efforts to hire local 
employees and use local businesses in our supply chain, EQT also makes significant charitable contributions each year to hundredsof non-profit organizations that specialize inmeeting the unique social needs of our neighbors.  In 2011, that total came to morethan $5.4 million.  The EQT Foundation, a separate 501(c)(3) organization created from a donation by EQT in 2003, awarded the bulkof these donations.  In 2011, the foundationawarded more than $3.5 million to support programming in four general categories that are of mutual importance to our company andour stakeholders:  Education, Arts & Culture,Environment and Community.  Included in this sum was more than $600,000 in grants to environmental programs, $300,000 to support community arts programs and at least$1.4 million to support various community and economic development programs.

www.eqt.comAt the local level, EQT provided just under 
$1.5 million to educational programs benefitting students attending public schools in Pennsylvania via the state’s Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) program.  In addition, we donated at least $125,000 to various volunteer fire departments, senior citizen centers and food banks, and almost$300,000 to support county fairs, festivals and other community-based programs.  Thesedonations were made in nearly every countywhere EQT has a regional headquarters or active field operations.  
Along with our corporate financial investments,
we are proud of our employees’ efforts to give back to the community.  In 2011, our employees donated just over $259,000 to localUnited Ways, and made personal donations of almost $293,000.  The EQT Foundation provided a 100% match of those donations,sending an additional $552,000 into localeconomies to help those who need it most. Public Policy and Political Engagement
EQT is a publically traded corporation.  As such,we govern our activities by, and fully complywith, all U.S. laws and regulations that overseepolitical engagement by companies like ours.Through our memberships in various trade organizations that represent the operating interests of the domestic natural gas industry,we participate in ongoing discussions regardinglaws, regulations and general public policy positions that may have short-, medium- orlong-term effects on our operations.  EQT maintains detailed policies and procedures regarding who may engage in such discussionson behalf of the Company, and how the Company will ensure compliance with the prevailing laws.  
EQT also provides financial and in-kind 
contributions to political parties, politicians andrelated institutions through the EQT EmployeesPennsylvania State Political Action Committee(PAC), the EQT Employees Federal PAC, andwith our corporate treasury dollars.

29When considering EQT’s sustainability 
obligations, we cannot underestimate the effects that our business operations have on the financial stability of our Company, our employees, our shareholders, and other stakeholders in the local communities where we operate.  In addition to being a well-runbusiness financially, we provide significant direct and indirect benefits to the local economy, support the energy infrastructure of our operating regions, and effectively manage the development and production of our natural gas reserves.Financial Results

include:
Every direct EQT Corporation job supportsan additional 1.84 jobs in the broader localeconomy.
Royalty payments made by EQT to its recipients have a ripple effect in the economy by fueling consumer spending.
Through its supply chain, EQT created jobsin related industries, some of which wouldnot exist without our network of activities. 
Our employees’ wages, and those of ourservice providers, have a similar ripple effecton the broader economy as these wagesare used to buy goods and services.  Local businesses in our supply chain maketheir own purchases and hire employees,who then spend their salaries and wagesthroughout the local, regional and stateeconomies.
To further highlight the ways that our 
operations, capital expenditures and royaltypayments benefit our communities, EQT askedthe Pennsylvania Economy League of GreaterPittsburgh (PELGP) to conduct three separateanalyses to estimate the economic impact ofthese three types of activity.  There is overlapbetween these analyses, so it is inaccurate tocombine the figures as this would significantlyoverstate the impact of EQT Corporation’s overall economic impact.

 Induced Effect represents the impact of employees of EQT, and the companies in our supply chain, as they
use their salaries and wages to purchase goods and services from other businesses for personal consumption.Economic Impact at the 
Local Level
To economically impact our local market via our standard procurement process, we utilizenational and regional councils to help identifylocal bidders.  In this effort, we sponsor the following councils: Western Pennsylvania Minority Supplier Development Council(WPMSDC), Women’s Business EnterpriseCouncil (WBENC) and African American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania (AACCWP).  When the proper criteria are met, we contract with local suppliers, benefiting the local economy.  
We value the socioeconomic significance 
of local economic development and are committed to awarding procurement contractslocally where possible. Although we spentmoney with suppliers in most of the statesthroughout the U.S., as a reflection of ourcommitment to spend locally, in 2011, wespent 37% of our procurement budget on suppliers located in the four states throughoutour geographical market. Factors that influencesupplier selection include: Safety - Safe and environmentally friendly 
operations are imperatives at EQT. To enforcethese essentials, suppliers must be approved by our Safety Department as applicable to thegood or service. 
Value - We place significance on the overall
value that suppliers offer. Suppliers who differentiate their offerings from their competitors through increased value meritgreater consideration.
Price - In most cases, lower supplier costs 
create a competitive advantage for suppliersbecause it enables us to achieve cost-savingswhich impacts our bottom line, increases shareholder value for our investors and positions us to potentially pass these cost savings on to our customers.
Quality - As we strive to increase our 
overall quality to better serve our customers in the communities we operate, we expectbest-in-class supply chain performance to mirror this pledge.                                                                                              
Delivery - On-time delivery is a critical 
measurement of consideration to avoid expensive operational delays.

In addition, we annually sponsorand participate in the WPMSDC OpportunityFair and WBENC Matchmaking Event to identify qualified bidders; and use these perennial events to promote subcontractingwith local businesses.
In 2011, EQT provided educational seminars 
to build the capacity of local firms with the following organizations:
Allegheny County Dept. of Minority,Women and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
The Pittsburgh Foundation
Pittsburgh Minority Business OpportunityCommittee Department of Veterans
Women’s Business Development Center
We also work closely with successfully 
performing companies to identify opportunitiesto expand the work that they do for EQT.  As these firms build up their capacity, they are then considered for larger projects, whichaffect the local workforce in a positive way.  
Infrastructure Investments
EQT is committed to contributing to the socialand economic vitality of the regions where our employees live and work. By strategicallyproviding financial, in-kind and human capital,EQT seeks to promote the growth of strong,livable communities – an essential componentof the Company's long-term business success.  
We prefer to focus on supporting innovative
local programs and initiatives that help our operating regions to produce an abundant andwell-trained workforce.  In turn, these regionsare able to maintain a diverse and economicallyviable business climate, and an environmentally safe and stable infrastructure.  Through philanthropic giving, matching 
gifts, local community outreach (includingsponsorships), and educational improvementgrants EQT provided more than $5.4 million to our operating communities throughout2011.  We also provided in-kind support viaemployee volunteerism and service on localnon-profit associations’ governance boards and committees.      
Beyond philanthropy, EQT supports severance
taxes and impact fees that compensate communities for any impact that drilling operations have on them.  We also work withlandowners to restore the land to its originalcondition after drilling, and we invest millionsof dollars each year to improve local roads andinfrastructure affected by our activities.   
From an energy provision standpoint, it’s 
important to remember that EQT operatessolely within the Unites States therefore, we are subject to various rules, regulations,policies, and procedures mandated by variousstate and local governing bodies regarding access to energy.  Unlike companies operatinginternationally, EQT has not made any recentinvestments related to new access to energy as this infrastructure is already in place in ourlocal communities.  Furthermore, our subsidiaryEquitable Gas is required by law to provide access to energy service within its assigned geographic territories.  Because of this obligation to serve, Equitable Gas has made no efforts to reduce long-term dependency on the Company.    
Finally, the Pennsylvania Public Utility 
Commission, the Public Service Commission ofWest Virginia, and the Kentucky Public ServiceCommission, regulate all rates, investments andservices related to providing access to energy to local communities, including investments in infrastructure for natural gas service withintheir respective jurisdictions, as well as the creation of cooperatives or local productivearrangements.www.eqt.comReserves and Production
Another important aspect of EQT’s economic
impact is its involvement in the developmentand production of natural gas reserves in different environments.  EQT reports its reserves and production in financial statementssubmitted to the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC), including its annual Form10-K.  We calculate the data in accordance with SEC regulations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.For 2011, all EQT operations took place onshore within the states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia.
With lower natural gas prices and the resultant
reduction in projected cash flow, EQT decided in January 2012 to suspend development of theHuron indefinitely, in favor of investing in itshigher return Marcellus Shale operations.  We made a similar decision in December 
2010, when EQT suspended the development of its Coal Bed Methane (CBM) extraction operations in Virginia.  Proved reserves in these two areas were 33% and 3%, respectively, of the total proved reserves as of year-end 2011.  
EQT expects to continue Huron and CBM 
production from existing wells; however, their contribution to our total production salesvolumes will gradually decline as we focusdrilling in the Marcellus.  In 2011, Huron and CBM wells accounted for approximately58% of total production sales volume, and approximately 40% production sales volume is expected for 2012.  This data is consistentwith our 2011 Form 10K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

EQT Corporation operates solely within the United States of America, 
so our business operations are subject to various U. S. federal, state andlocal environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining tovarious sustainability issues.  We must take these regulations into accountin all aspects of our business, and have established procedures for ongoing evaluation of our operations to identify potential environmentalexposures, and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures.  (Refer to EQT’s 2011 Form 10K pages 13, 97-98, for a more detailed discussion of these impacts.)
Various events and circumstances can presents risks to our business 
including Natural gas price volatility, having the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market, the ability to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, negative public perception, and the loss of key personnel (2011 Form 10K pages 13 - 21).  These same events and circumstances can result in growth opportunities.
This is EQT’s first report submittal under GRI standards, so no sustainability
targets were set for 2011 or 2012, and no performance against targets, or lessons learned are available for the current reporting period.  We alsodid not have governance mechanisms in place during 2011 or 2012 tospecifically manage sustainability risk and opportunities or identify otherrelated risks and opportunities, but many aspects of sustainability risks and opportunities are the responsibility of the Public Policy and CorporateResponsibility Committee of the EQT Board of Directors.  Additional information about this committee and its responsibilities can be found athttp://ir.eqt.com/governance.cfm.
EQT will use the information contained in the completed 2011 report, 
as well as results achieved in 2012, to establish specific sustainability objectives and goals for reporting in the future.  As part of the process to establish these objectives, EQT will also define and implement an appropriate governance mechanism to manage existing sustainabilityrisks/opportunities and identify new ones.

The term ‘local’ will be used herein to describe the four states in which 
EQT Corporation conducted its operational activities in 2011.  
We encourage our first tier suppliers and contractors to utilize local 
suppliers through the following procurement processes as follows: 
Bidding process and RFP Language - To reassure local supplier utilization,
during our solicitation process, we include language in our RFP’s that stronglyencourages prime suppliers to seek out and include diverse businesses aspart of their proposed solution. All bidders must complete and submit asubcontracting form with its proposal. The inclusion of diverse companies, mostof which are local, will be evaluated as part of the review of their proposal.  
Tier 2 Program - In our efforts to promote local spend and diverse supplier
utilization, our Procurement Department requests our top suppliers to provideus with their monthly spend with diverse subcontractors which includedmany local suppliers. As a result, in 2011, our prime suppliers increased our second tier spend by more than 6 million dollars over the previous year.  
Procurement Value Drivers (VD) - To encourage diverse supplier 
utilization and to ensure accountability, we actively track and report thenumber of diverse suppliers, aggregate spend and percentage of diversespend. The majority of diverse firms used were local.
Through our procurement process, we seek out local suppliers to bid on
projects where possible.  We strive to build relationships with diverse suppliers that provide high quality goods and services, are competitivelypriced, and are able to perform to our scale.  In 2011, we utilized in excessof 100 first tier diversity suppliers.  We also evaluate the safety performanceof each potential supplier through a standardized prequalification process. 
See “Social Responsibility” section of this report.
At EQT, we use our resources to encourage economic growth in the regions
we touch by supporting selected initiatives that can enable these areas tohelp themselves achieve success.  We do  not expect, nor seek, to gain direct economic benefit from these investments.
Neither EQT nor its subsidiary Equitable Gas conducted a community needs 
assessment in 2011.
As a natural gas utility operating solely in the United States, EQT’s 
distribution subsidiary Equitable Gas is subject to the rules, regulations, policies and procedures mandated by various state and local governing bodies where the company operates, and is required to provide access toenergy service within its assigned geographic territories.

FullyFullyEQT facilities utilized 22,008,700,000,000 joules of direct energy in 2011
from non-renewable energy sources, mostly natural gas (very limited use ofheating oil) to condition spaces for occupancy.  None of the direct energywas from renewable sources.  
None of EQT’s direct energy consumption for our vehicle fleet is from 
renewable sources.  2011 Total direct energy consumption by non-renewable primary source for vehicles was  283,796.80992 gigajoules(2,153,892 gallons or gas gallon equivalents).
EQT has no oil/gas refineries or petrochemical operations so it has no 
energy intensities to report.
See “Environmental Stewardship - Energy Use” section of this report.EQT’s primary indirect source of energy is the use of electricity.  The primary
fuels utilized for electricity production in the areas EQT operates are coal,natural gas, and nuclear.  
EQT Facilities utilized 44,535,100,000,000 joules or 12,370.861 MWh of
indirect energy in 2011.  EQT does not contract for renewable energysources.  
EQT leases all equipment used for its production, midstream and 
distribution activities, so the company does not have any indirect sources of energy for these activities.

disposal methods possible.  We reuse (or sell as usable product) materialssuch as flowback fluid and condensate, whenever possible.  In 2011, EQTreused 16.9 million gallons of flowback water from Marcellus drilling completions, disposed of 27 million gallons of fracking fluid in injectionwells and sent 177 tons of hazardous waste liquids (from midstream compressor stations and fluids associated with drilling and completions) to treatment facilities for disposal.

EQT currently tracks waste for landfill, routine operations, and unusual

The following information is also not applicable to EQT operations: De minimus threshold for waste reporting

Volume of produced water in WV:
95,347 bbls from conventional wells – 100% disposed at an injection well2,377,885 bbls from Marcellus wells – 97% disposed at an injection well;3% reused.
Volume of produced water in KY:
93,455 bbls – 100% disposed at an injection well.
Volume of produced water in VA:
1,385,582 bbls – 100% disposed at an injection well.
Volume of produced water in PA:
24,000,000 bbls – 83%  disposed at an injection well; 17% reused.
All produced water is either injected or reused, so EQT does not discharge
any produced water to surface water, however EQT does flow back waterto permitted, lined, above-ground impoundments.  Because there is no discharge, no report standards for produced water quality are required orreported.  Since all produced water is either injected or reused, EQT alsodoes not measure the volume of hydrocarbon discharge in produced water.
EQT defines a significant spill as a spill requiring notification to state or 
federal officials.  Based on this definition, there were 56 reportable spillswith a total volume of 244 bbls.  EQT had zero reportable spills that released more than 100 bbls into the environment, and EQT did not reportany spills in our 2011 Form 10-K or any other financial statements.
EQT assesses the impacts of all reported spills and remediates them.  For 
all of the reported spills, EQT’s quick utilization of appropriate and effectivecleanup measures resulted in the complete absorption and/or removal ofthe spill, so there were minimal impacts to the environment and local community.  After the cleanup, EQT evaluates the cause of all spills and implements corrective action to prevent recurrence.  
EQT does not use chemical dispersants; to minimize the environmental 
impacts, our spill prevention measures are primarily absorbent booms andpads, along with soil excavation.  These measures release no dispersants to the environment, yet completely contain, and ultimately remove, thecontents of the spill.  Coupled with the removal and disposal of the cleanup materials according to prevailing federal, state and /or local regulatory requirements in effect at the ti me and location of the spill, these cleanup
measures resulted in minimal e nvironmental or community impacts.
EQT does not maintain data on the number of volume of hydrocarbon and
non-hydrocarbon spills nor does it collect this data from third parties as stateor federal officials do not require it.  We will explore capturing the data inthis manner for future activity as it was not required or collected in 2012.
The total monetary value of significant fines in 2011 was $142,997.  There

EQT does not separately track Maternity/Paternity Leave; rather, the data 
reported includes all employees who took leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) in 2011.
Regular full and part-time employees of EQT corporation and its 
subsidiaries, who did not meet all of the following requirements by December 31, 2011 were not eligible for FMLA leave:
 At least 12 months of service with the Company (does not have to be 
consecutive); and 
 A minimum of 1,250 hours of work with EQT during the 12 month 
period immediately preceding the commencement of the FMLA leave. 
Part-time employees with less than 1 year of service are also not eligible for
FMLA leave.
Note: All 11 employees reported as taking FMLA parental leave did so in 
the first half of 2011.  There were no employees that re quested leave in the
second half of 2011.
11.2% of EQT’s total workforce is covered by a collective bargaining 
agreement.
EQT has not pre-determined (as a matter of policy) the minimum number 
of weeks of notice that will be given in the event of significant operationalchanges. The length of the notice period is determined on a case-by-casebasis considering several factors which include, but are not limited to, number of employees affected, type or impact of operational change, timeframe for implementing change, legal/contractual obligations to bargainover the change and/or the effects of the change, etc.
EQT’s collective bargaining agreements (“CBA”) do not set forth a 
minimum notice period for making/announcing a significant operationalchange if the change does not affect current working conditions or otherconditions of employment.  If the significant operational change modifiesworking conditions or other conditions of employment in effect or established by the CBA, the party seeking the change must provide 10 days’notice of its intent to bargain over the change in working conditions.
Between 25% and 50% of the total workforce is represented in joint health
and safety committees.  These joint committees typically operate at the District or Area Supervisor level down to hourly workers.
EQT does not utilize supervised workers as defined by GRI, nor does the
company utilize independent contractors for onsite work, so we do notmaintain safety data for these categories of workers. All reported data applies to EQT's total 2011 workforce of 1,835 employees, and includesminor (first-aid level) injuries.   EQT uses OSHA accepted calculation ratesthat utilize total work hours.  The normalization factor is 200,000 whichrepresent 100 full time workers for one year.

Although this incident did not involve EQT personnel, we did review our 
existing safety procedures with our own employees to reinforce adherenceto our workplace safety initiatives designed to avoid similar incidents.  We also instructed the vendor to take similar measures in order to remain in compliance with EQT’s Contractor Safety Program and its ContractorSafety Work Rules.  
EQT employees are required to report all safety incidences.  We conduct all 
reporting in compliance with OSHA rules.
EQT's wellness program, called “Take Charge,” includes personal health 
coaching, wellness information, and health management programs.  Theprogram also provides confidential short-term counseling, information, andreferral services for issues such as family and relationship concerns, eldercare referral, money management, or legal problems. 
These resources are administered outside of EQT, and individual results or 
information from any part of the Program remain strictly confidential andare not provided to EQT.  The “Take Charge” Wellness Program includesquarterly educational sessions, facilitated by professional medical staff, foremployees during work hours and newsletters mailed to employee homesfor the benefit of employee families.
EQT’s Employee Assistance Program provides confidential counseling

Anyone living in the employee’s household is also eligible for this benefit.The Company pays the full cost for up to five in-person visits with a counselor for each problem.  
EQT maintains detailed standards for assessing potential hazards in the
work environment and selecting the appropriate forms of equipment toprotect employees, contractors, service providers and visitors.   
EQT’s collective bargaining agreements (“CBA”) are the only agreements
between the Company and the labor unions representing certain employees that cover health and safety topics.  Two of three CBA’s contain the following general acknowledgement/agreement concerninghealth and safety:
“The Company shall institute and maintain all necessary precautions for
safeguarding the safety of its employees, and all employees are expected to cooperate in the implementation thereof.  Both the Company and theUnion recognize their mutual obligations to assist in the prevention, correction and elimination of all unsafe working conditions and practices.”
All three CBA’s provide for joint management-employee health and safety
committees.
