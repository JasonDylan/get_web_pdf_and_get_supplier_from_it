Exponential ValueRunning industrial processes with “gray” water. Using 
less energy to clean food-processing equipment. Reduc -
ing plastic waste through solids chemistry. Improving the efficiency of desalination. Maintaining clean linens and sanitary kitchens with less water and energy. 
Those are just some of the ways we partnered with our 
customers in 2013 to help them manage complex business challenges with sustainable solutions. Our associates are working on-site at more than 1.3 million customer loca -
tions in more than 170 countries around the world. They know firsthand what problems our customers are facing, and they apply unlimited resourcefulness to find  
the solutions. 
Fundamental to our approach is an understanding that 
real and lasting change is accelerated when economic, environmental and social benefits align. This has been true since our beginnings more than 90 years ago. Today, when the pressure on all natural resources is far greater, and the expectations for sustainable performance are much higher, our ability to help our customers do more with less is even more important. 
The purpose of our company is to provide and protect 
what is vital: clean water, safe food, abundant energy and healthy environments. There are more people needing more food, more water and more energy than ever before. With this as our business focus, we operate at the nexus of the world’s most critical business, environmental and social challenges. It’s a very exciting place to be. In 2013, Ecolab associates helped customers in more than 40 industries operate more efficiently, expand their opera-tions responsibly in resource-scarce regions, and adapt to meet changing conditions and expectations. Our business model combines technology and information with on-the-ground service and training to deliver lasting improve-ments. Because we are so close to our customers, with intimate knowledge of their operations, we are able to bring informed insights to our research and development work. 
Our 25,000 sales and service associates are supported 
by 1,600 scientists working in our global innovation centers in Europe, North America, and Asia, as well as additional technical centers in strategic locations. Last year, we launched a number of new solutions to help our customers improve operational efficiency and minimize environmental impact. In fact, it was the largest innova -
tion pipeline in our company’s history, with more than 80 significant product introductions. As part of our innova -
tion process, we consider how each solution reduces cost, increases efficiency, minimizes use of natural resources and improves human and environmental safety – through sourcing, manufacturing, transportation and delivery, use and disposal. You’ll read about some of those innovations in this report. 
Our work for our customers has naturally led us to collab -
oration within industries and across sectors to address 
global challenges. A good example is our involvement with the Alliance for Water Stewardship. Last year, we fielded a MeS S a ge  Fr oM eCo lab

the beta International Water Stewardship Standard at two 
sites within the lower Yangtze, one of China’s most critical watersheds. By advancing the development of the Stan -
dard in one of the world’s most water-stressed regions, we are helping to improve water management practices globally. We’re also sharing our expertise and our insights through a number of industry groups that are working on sustainability issues — an extension of our customer relationships. 
While our greatest impact will always be through our work 
with our customers, we walk the talk within our own com-pany. As Ecolab grows and becomes increasingly global, we are strengthening our commitment to minimizing the environmental impact of our own operations and improving our safety performance. 
This past year, workplace and driver safety programs 
were launched globally. We reduced vehicle accidents by 9 percent and injuries by 6 percent — and severe vehicle accidents were at a world-class low level. Our ultimate objective is zero accidents and injuries, and we keep  
working toward that goal. 
We also have a history of continuously improving our 
environmental performance. Ecolab achieved a 22.4 per -
cent intensity reduction in U.S. GHG emissions from our 2006 baseline, exceeding our stated goal by 2012. We also reduced waste by 20 percent between 2009 and 2012, surpassing a target of 18 percent. Going forward, we’re committed to doing even more  
to be responsible stewards of the environment. In 2014,  
we will set the bar higher for ourselves. We will launch more aggressive global sustainability targets, including a  
25 percent reduction in effluent discharge and waste,  
a 20 percent reduction in water use and a 10 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2017. 
We are finding that talented people who want to make 
a real difference in the world are drawn to our company because of our purpose, our dedicated associates and our unique ability to help address complex global challenges. We know that our customers are counting on us to help them succeed and grow, and to meet their own ambitious sustainability goals. Our growing global team is eager to exceed their expectations. We’re proud of what our 45,000 associates do every day in partnership with our customers to make the world cleaner, safer and healthier.

At Ecolab, we gain considerable insight from our custom -
ers — the challenges they face and the results they want. 
This knowledge drives our innovation. The success of our innovation is evaluated by how well our solutions support the goals of our customers.
With our talented team of scientists and our state-of-
the-art innovation centers, Ecolab leads the industry in developing new, effective solutions that help customers improve operations and create positive environmental impact. 
In 2013, we launched more new products than ever before, 
with more than 80 significant product introductions, representing our fifth consecutive year of double-digit pipeline growth. We now hold more than 6,500 patents.
We take a to tal im pact ap proach to 
innovation. We look holistically at the 
environmental, economic and social impacts of our products and service offerings, considering how each solution increases efficiency, minimizes the use of natural resources and improves safety — from sourcing to manufacturing to use and through disposal. In 2013, we successfully launched a new Product Profile 
process. This purposeful process integrates sustainability factors into the assessment of new products and profiles the impact of our products from concept through develop-ment and launch.
Our acquisitions of Nalco in 2011 and Champion Technol -
ogies in 2013 have spurred additional innovation. As we 
have evolved as a combined company, we also have found opportunity in matching effective solutions to new uses. We leveraged antimicrobial solutions from our Food &  
Beverage business into our Global Energy business to treat wastewater in an environmentally responsible man -
ner. We advanced clean-in-place applications for our Food & Beverage customers using 3D TRASAR
TM Technology 
and automation to reduce operational costs and enhance food safety. And we launched the solid chemistry formu -
lations we first developed for our institutional customers into our Water & Process Services operations to reduce packaging waste and environmental footprint and improve worker safety. 
 
It is this investment in research, development and inno -
vation that drives our ability to stay at the forefront of addressing ever-emerging and changing business and environmental challenges.

Exponential ValueCuSt o M er iMPaCt : SAFE FOOD
Over the next two decades, it is anticipated that the world 
will need 50 percent more food to meet the needs of a rap-idly growing population. In addition, the rise of the middle class, urbanization, higher-protein diets and more meals away from home are trends that are dramatically shifting food demands, particularly in emerging economies. 
Producing more food requires more water and energy and 
more efficient operations across the food-supply chain (from agriculture and livestock production to process -
ing and food service). To ensure a safe, sustainable food supply, we also need to find ways to ensure we are able to consume more of the food we are already producing. This means preventing contamination and spoilage from harvest to consumption.

A powerful combination of factors is changing the face 
of healthcare delivery. Payment reform, cost pressures, new models of care, an aging population and heightened awareness of healthcare associated infections (HAIs) are rapidly shifting the priorities of healthcare providers large and small.
Today, the risks are bigger than ever before. Healthcare 
providers are being held more accountable for patient out -
comes as well as ethical, cost-conscious operating prac -
tices. Patient satisfaction is paramount, requiring holistic, enterprise-wide approaches to keeping facilities cleaner, safer, healthier and more efficient — minimizing waste as well as water and energy use in the process.
Our programs meet the toughest infection-prevention 
challenges from the frontlines of emergency medicine to operating rooms, long-term care facilities and medical clinics. With a comprehensive approach, our solutions attack bacteria at the source where infection is likely to be born and transmitted, be it incoming water and air sources, medical instruments and drapes, surfaces or peo -
ple. Our suite of sustainable solutions enables customers to focus on what matters most: the health of their patients and the safety of their staff.The results of an anonymous survey conducted in 2013 by Ecolab of nearly 200 hospital purchasing officers, clinicians and sustainability decision-makers found the following:
Sustainability concerns are influencing 
changes in hospital policies and processes for 70 percent of respondents.
Fifty percent of respondents were 
concerned about the current amount of waste produced in the operating room.
Ecolab is an active 
member of Practice Greenhealth, a non -
profit membership organization in the United States founded on the principles of positive environmental stewardship and best practices by organizations in the healthcare community. Ecolab partners with Practice Greenhealth to advance environmental solutions for the healthcare sector to create better, safer, healthier workplaces and communities.

We apply the same continuous improvement model we use with our customers to improve our own operations. Through our Create & Maintain Value (CMV) program, we employ our expertise and technology to save water, energy and wastewater and prolong equipment life throughout our facilities. 
In 2013, Ecolab completed 42 capital expenditure and CMV 
projects at 25 manufacturing plants around the world to improve the efficiency of our operations. Just as our programs result in exponential value to customers, these projects resulted in meaningful performance, efficiency, and water, energy and waste reductions across our oper -
ations and will contribute to our ongoing reduction efforts.  
 Our 2013 achievements are the result of an enterprise- and facility-level commitment to increasing the efficiency of our operations through action and investments that result in greater environmental stewardship. Examples of plant-specific projects in 2013 include the following:

•
 Our Clearing, Ill., plant implemented a process and

• Our facility in Konnagar, India, reduced water use  
from 25,000 cubic meters in 2012 to 18,000 cubic meters in 2013 through several cycle-time reduction projects. 
• Our Lerma, Mexico, plant installed reverse osmosis

Ecolab’s manufacturing plant and distribution center in 
Taicang, China, further supports Ecolab’s commitment to help improve food safety and public health practices in China. This facility also has been designed to be environ -
mentally sustainable. 
Our Taicang facility, which opened in late 2012, is Ecolab’s 
third-largest in the world and the company’s largest in the Asia Pacific region, with capacity to produce all of the  
Ecolab products sold in China, up to 150,000 tons of prod -
uct annually. The facility is located in the Yangtze River basin, the most important freshwater resource in China, providing water for 400 million people.To minimize our environmental impact on the region’s critical natural resources, we operate using features that reduce energy and water consumption while minimizing waste production. One example is the facility’s on-site plant to convert process wastewater into distilled water for reuse on-site.  
This facility demonstrates our commitment to water  
stewardship through the integration of water-saving 
practices at the facility and through our collaboration with other water users in the watershed to advance water  
management practices through the Alliance for Water Stewardship’s International Water Stewardship Standard.32

In August 2012, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the final rule regarding the sourcing of conflict minerals as defined in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Sec -
tion 1502. This rule requires publicly traded companies to report annually to the SEC the presence of “conflict miner -
als” originating from Central Africa in either the products they manufacture or contract to manufacture, or those they use in the production process. Conflict minerals are tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG).
In 2013, Ecolab initiated a process that meets the Orga -
nization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) framework to comply with this regulation. This includes establishing compliance requirements for our direct suppliers regarding conflict minerals, implementing controls and reporting, undertaking appropriate sourcing efforts and providing our customers the data necessary to facilitate their SEC reporting. Ecolab has developed and adopted an official Conflict Minerals Policy outlining our company commitment and expectations for our suppliers. We will file the necessary documentation prior to the regu -

Understanding underlying and potential risks is a critical 
component to improving safety outcomes. Our Global Safety Dashboard tracks our performance on a range of leading and lagging safety indicators. This level of trans -
parency helps us focus on areas of greatest needs and measure the effectiveness of our safety programs.
Proactively identifying where issues arise helps us miti -
gate potential incidents. Through near-miss reporting and 
safety audits, we identify, assess and address risks at our locations and customer facilities. Our near-miss reporting program resulted in 30 percent fewer near-miss incidents reported in 2013 compared to 2012. We completed 205 safety audits, with a specific emphasis on our manufactur -
ing and sales operations.
Feedback from ec olab’s 2013  
Your Voice Matters employee  
survey ranked safety as the  
#1 driver of employee engagement.

The world is facing unprecedented challenges related to water. The global risks associated with water scarcity require water users to move beyond water conservation  
to responsible water stewardship. In 2013, Ecolab  
partnered with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) to establish new standards for comprehensive water-  
resource management. 
We field tested the Alliance for Water Stewardship’s beta 
International Water Stewardship Standard at two sites within the lower Yangtze, one of China’s most critical watersheds, to help fine-tune the standard for global adoption. 
In 2014, we will support the global launch of the  
Alliance for Water Stewardship’s International Water  
Stewardship Standard and will further implement the 
Standard throughout our global operations.

Our Community Giving Program focuses in the areas 
of youth and education, civic and community develop -
ment, arts and culture, environment and conservation. Where possible, contributions are leveraged with Ecolab employee involvement to maximize the positive impact we deliver to the community.
