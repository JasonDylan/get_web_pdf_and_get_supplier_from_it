// PGS ESG Report 2020
2We reduced our vessel capacity to match the market decline by 
stacking three vessels. The effects of the pandemic on energy 
demand similarly forced us to let go approximately 40% of our 
workforce. This was dramatic for individuals and teams, and our  
focus was on conducting the process fairly, thoroughly, and swiftly.  
Significant staff reductions meant we had to reorganize and simplify 
processes. We retained our global footprint, maintaining critical 
presence in key markets, and centralized strategic functions. Our 
commercial activities were consolidated into a single unit – Sales 
& Services. A new entity was created to manage digitalization 
initiatives, research and development, enterprise IT and compute 
infrastructure – Technology & Digitalization. Going forward this unit 
will enable us to capitalize further on important digital synergies 
across our service offering. The new organization aligns our business 
to a lower activity level, but with the flexibility to scale up without 
adding cost proportionately. 
Despite the challenges, our relentless focus on HSEQ and ESG 
matters continued with full force. Our commitment to the ten 
principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of 
human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption applies in 
bad times as in good, as we proved in 2020. That commitment is 
evidenced by this report.

President and CEO 
February 23, 2021Dear Reader
2020 was a particularly challenging year for the energy 
industry. The dramatic slow-down in business activity, 
caused by the Covid-19 crisis, reduced revenues in PGS by 
close to 40 % compared to 2019, significantly complicated 
field operations, and left PGS no other choice than to 
immediately implement cost reduction measures.
// PGS ESG Report 2020
3This is our fourth corporate responsibility report shaped by the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals, introduced in 2015. The Board of 
Directors and the CEO actively ensure that the Company properly 
responds to ESG challenges.
During 2020, we have renewed our materiality assessment. The Board 
and the CEO have been actively involved in this process, as well as the 
assessment of the Company’s impact on ESG development goals. The 
material indicators on which this report is focused were discussed 
and selected during several Board and management meetings. 
The Board and the CEO regularly discuss ESG opportunities, risks 
and goals to ensure that they are integrated into the operations, 
culture, values, incentives and business practices of PGS. This report 
documents how PGS performed against the commitments we set in 
2019 and the way forward for 2021. Statement from the Board & CEO
Good management of Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) opportunities and risks is essential 
to business success. It motivates employees, investors, 
customers, and other stakeholders on whom businesses 
rely to operate successfully and safely.

7Materiality Assessment
The backbone of this report and our ESG 
response, is our materiality assessment. 
During 2020, PGS intensified its work 
on ESG, mobilizing a cross-functional 
team to better understand the risks and 
opportunities, the main expectations of our 
principal stakeholders, and the economic, 
social, and environmental impacts of our 
activities. Our senior executive team and our 
Board of Directors reviewed and approved 
that analysis. Through internal fact-finding 
and research, we identified our main stakeholders and their key expectations. 
This is an ongoing process. We continually 
deepen and broaden our understanding of 
our stakeholder universe, through dialog 
combined with monitoring of our economic, 
social, and environmental impact.

PGS has adopted a set of 17 ESG indicators that were developed from 
the 37 GRI standards. For each of the indicators below, the associated 
GRI standard(s) are referenced in brackets.
// PGS ESG Report 2020
8Our new materiality assessment seeks to 
identify the indicators of highest concern 
or interest to our stakeholders, and those 
with the largest impact on value creation 
for PGS. Areas with limited exposure are 
not included on our list of material issues, 
as our goal is to focus our efforts where we have the highest impact and can make the 
most difference. Indicators reported in the 
present report may, therefore, differ from 
previous PGS responsibility reports. The 
reporting format has also changed, following 
our adoption of the GRI core option.  
The Environmental, Social and Governance sections of this report summarize our actions  
on each of these material indicators. Impact on value creationBiodiversity

PGS Gears Up for the New Energy Landscape
The energy transition is creating new 
markets and causing existing ones to 
evolve. As part of our commitment of SDG 
9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, 
we have launched a new initiative to 
address the changing energy landscape. 
Through this initiative, we will investigate 
business potential outside of our core oil 
and gas E&P business and will be aiming 
to further strengthen sustainable practices 
throughout our value chain.  
In February 2021, we stepped up and 
formalized our efforts by established a 
team to develop opportunities for applying 
our geophysical assets and expertise to 
the areas of carbon capture and storage, 
offshore wind power, and seabed minerals. Seismic data will be a fundamental 
requirement in all three markets. Our goal 
is to fully understand how we best can 
apply our capabilities, and it is our ambition 
to build a sustainable business and service 
offering outside of oil and gas. Providing 
reliable geophysical information about the 
subsurface in marine environments is our 
core business. 
Although oil and gas will be essential to 
energy security for many years to come, the 
landscape is changing. Future investments 
by the energy industry are increasingly 
directed towards new sources of energy, 
and reliable solutions for carbon capture 
and storage. PGS is well qualified to help its 
customers in the search for new resources 
and lower emissions. 
// PGS ESG Report 2020
11Environmental
To fulfill our environmental ambitions, we are committed 
to reducing the risk of harm to the environment, 
complying with legal requirements and industry 
standards, and achieving a continual improvement in 
our environmental performance. PGS has been ISO 14001 
certified since 2012. A formal commitment to continual 
improvements in our environmental performance 
ensures that our management system and practices  
are in line with best practices.

13Environmental Compliance
PGS operates around the globe in a range 
of environments, from the tropics to the 
arctic, from mature oil provinces to frontier 
areas. The countries in which we operate 
have varying requirements when it comes 
to environmental compliance and our 
business activities are exposed to different 
international, national, regional or state 
environmental laws and regulations. 
We are committed to strict compliance 
with all environmental laws and regulations 
and have processes in place to assess our 
exposure to regulatory risk at the company 
level, for seismic projects and the locations 
where we have offices. Compliance 
obligations are identified, documented, and 
kept up to date in our Environmental Aspects 
and Compliance Obligations registers. 
In 2020 we had one minor non-compliance 
with permit requirements on a geophysical 
survey. This has been reported to the 
relevant authority. 
Biodiversity
Our ambition is to generate high-quality 
seismic data with the least amount of 
environmental impact and interference 
with other users of the oceans. Minimizing 
the acoustic impact of geophysical 
operations on marine life is a priority. We 
strictly comply with laws, regulations and 
industry best practices when conducting 
our work and continuously examine our 
methods to identify ways to further reduce 
our environmental footprint. Our research and development teams 
are actively involved in various Research 
& Development projects that each may 
lead to measurable reductions in our 
environmental footprint and the acoustic 
impact of seismic surveys on marine life. 
Marine-life Risk Assessments
Before every project, we ensure that 
the appropriate level of environment 
assessment has been conducted, 
conforming to national legal requirements 
related to the permitting or licensing of a 
seismic survey. Our project managers are 
responsible for ensuring that a marine-
life monitoring and mitigation plan is in 
place in accordance with local legislation, 
best practices and client requirements. 
We assess risks relating to the interaction 
between vessel activities, marine life 
and other users of the oceans such as 
commercial and artisanal fishery and  
local indigenous populations.  
A project-specific risk assessment is 
conducted, in addition to the national 
legal requirements for conducting 
environment impact or marine-life 
disturbance assessments as part of a 
project permitting or licensing process. 
Project risk assessment identifies relevant 
environment risks and appropriate 
mitigations for the specific geographic area 
of operation and is conducted throughout 
the lifecycle of a project, including those 
related to the potential interaction with 
marine life. // Environmental
// PGS ESG Report 2020
14Marine-life Monitoring and Mitigation
PGS has global experience of implementing, 
monitoring and mitigating activities during 
seismic operations across the world. The 
marine life guidance procedures in our 
management system establish a common 
framework for the management of PGS 
activities offshore and potential interaction 
with marine wildlife. 
All PGS vessels implement seismic source 
‘soft-start’ measures as standard practice 
and, in the absence of national guidelines, 
we follow International Association 
of Geophysical Contractors (IAGC) 
recommended measures and guidance 
related to the interaction of underwater 
sound and marine life. We implement 
additional visual and acoustic monitoring 
and mitigation activities as identified by 
either regulatory, Environment Impact 
Assessment outcomes or client best 
practice requirements on a project-by-
project basis. Such additional services are 
typically provided via third-party contractor 
personnel (Marine Mammal Observers, 
Protected Species Observers, Marine 
Fauna Observers and/or Passive Acoustic 
Monitoring). We have more personnel 
onboard responsible to monitoring and 
mitigating our effect on the environment than we have looking at the seismic  
data that we record. 
In line with regulatory requirements, 
all sightings and detections of marine 
mammals during the survey period 
are recorded, including any beyond the 
maximum mitigation-zone boundaries. 
Examples of monitoring and mitigation 
measures that we implement include: 
	Seismic survey planning to facilitate 
efficient seismic operations and 
minimize the risk to marine life. 
	Realtime marine mammal visual and 
towed Passive Acoustic Monitoring 
during operations. 
	Seismic source ‘soft-start’ procedures. 
	Exclusion or safety zones. 
	Delay to source start and suspension  
of operations if marine mammals  
are detected within pre-defined 
exclusion zones. 
	Stakeholder consultation where required 
in areas with potential for conflicting 
operations with other users of the oceans. 
	Dedicated local Fishery Liaison Officer 
(FLO) to manage interaction and 
communication with fisheries. // Environmental
// PGS ESG Report 2020
15Supporting Seabed 2030// Environmental // Case Study
In 2019, PGS committed to support the Seabed 
2030 project. Seabed 2030 is a collaborative 
project between the Nippon Foundation of Japan 
and the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans 
(GEBCO). It aims to bring together all available 
bathymetric data to produce the definitive map 
of the world ocean floor by 2030 and make it 
available to all. In 2020 we implemented a live-feed of 
echo-sounder data to Seabed 2030 from all 
our vessels. Wherever our vessels travel we 
send back data that will eventually improve 
bathymetric mapping of the ocean floor and  
lead to more accurate sea charts improving  
the safety of all at sea.
// PGS ESG Report 2020
16Ghost Net Initiative// Environmental // Case Study
PGS supports The Ghost Net & Marine Debris 
Removal Initiative (GNI), an ocean debris 
removal project of the International Association 
of Geophysical Contractors (IAGC). We are 
committed to creating a healthier ocean 
environment by clearing marine debris, which  
is among the greatest dangers to marine life.  Our ambitions towards finding ways for 
collecting plastics at sea by using the inherent 
capabilities of seismic vessels are still going 
strong. More information about Plastic Collection 
Concept can be found on our website. 
// PGS ESG Report 2020
17Energy and Emissions
Reducing energy use and associated air 
emissions is a company-wide focus area 
for environmental performance. Our 
overall performance objective is to achieve 
continuous improvement towards our 
target of reducing relative emissions  
by 50% by 2030 compared to 2011. 
All PGS vessels shall have a Ship Energy 
Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) in 
place, which establishes a mechanism to 
improve the energy efficiency of vessel 
operations. The SEEMP includes: 
	Review and consideration of operational 
practices and technology upgrades that 
may contribute to optimizing the energy 
efficiency performance of a vessel. 
	Implementation of monitoring tools  
and performance objectives related  
to improved energy efficiency and 
emission reduction.  Examples of energy reduction measures  
we have taken include: 
	Engine and machinery upgrades 
	Anti-barnacle technology to reduce  
drag from in-sea equipment. 
	Installation of energy efficient air 
separation and free cooling technology 
for data centers 
	Use of energy-efficient computer  
node technology 
	Automatic light-control systems// Environmental

18Real-time Energy Monitoring  
and Performance Optimization// Environmental // Case Study
In 2020 we developed and started rolling-out 
real-time energy monitoring and performance 
optimization for our fleet. Through our 
digitalization partnerships with Google and 
Cognite, our digitalization team implemented 
real-time data feeds of energy consumption, 
propulsion, speed and other operational parameters from each vessel. Advanced 
analytics are applied to this data and a real-time 
view of performance and energy efficiency with 
benchmarking across the fleet is now used to 
actively monitor and optimize the performance 
of each vessel with a focus on reducing fuel 
usage and emissions to air. 
// PGS ESG Report 2020
19Divesting Redundant Equipment// Environmental // Case Study
As part of our pledge to undertake initiatives 
that promote greater environmental 
responsibility, we have signed a cooperation 
agreement with SurplusHub, the global online 
portal for selling and buying surplus oil, gas and 
shipping equipment and materials. 
Storing, maintaining and potentially 
scrapping equipment is costly and far from 
environmentally friendly. As such, we will utilize 
the SurplusHub platform to potentially dispose 
of redundant equipment, which other companies 
may benefit from re-using. SurplusHub.com is a web-based, automated 
marketplace that connects buyers and sellers  
all over the world and enables them to negotiate 
agreements for buying and selling surplus oil, gas, 
and shipping equipment. Many have described 
the portal as an ‘eBay for oil and gas equipment’ . 
PGS has already begun adding assets to the 
online portal and a significant number of 
maritime and seismic parts and other surplus 
equipment will be listed in the weeks and 
months to come. 
// PGS ESG Report 2020
20Social
Our success depends on maintaining good relations 
with our employees and other stakeholders. We aim to 
nurture these through open dialogue, to increase mutual 
understanding and encourage positive relationships.

24Employment and Labor Relations
Our ambition is to attract, engage, develop, 
and retain a highly skilled workforce. We are 
committed to recruiting individuals based 
on their qualifications, value and potential. 
Diversity is considered an important 
parameter in recruitment. We provide 
attractive and fair compensation and benefit 
packages that support our overall employee 
value proposition. 
The year 2020 was about company 
survival. We hired 27 employees, while 333 
unfortunately had to leave the Company. 
All employees that were considered for 
termination, underwent a consultation 
period where a notice was given of one 
to five weeks prior to their consultation 
meeting. Although not a legal requirement, 
the employees were encouraged to bring 
representatives to support them in the 
consultation meeting. In most cases,  
the meetings were attended by the 
employee, their immediate manager,  
an HR representative, and the 
representative of the employee.  
Once a termination agreement was 
reached, the affected employees were 
offered outplacement support, which 
included a transition-assistance program 
aimed at ensuring their continued 
employability. A total of 147 people used 
the services of the external outplacement 
support company.
Occupational Health and Safety
Seismic operations encompass many 
high-risk activities and involve working in 
remote areas and locations with elevated health and security risks. Our health and 
safety management system is structured 
around the ‘Plan-Do-Act-Check’ model for 
continuous improvement, as defined by 
the IAGC/IOGP Guidelines and is certified 
according to the ISO 14001 and OHSAS 
18001 standards.  
Management of health and safety in PGS 
is a line-management responsibility. Our 
HSEQ department consists of subject-
matter experts within maritime, quality, 
environment, and security, who support 
and advise line management and crew. 
Our ambition is zero injury to people.  
We are committed to: 
	Promoting good health and well-being 
for all people who involved in our 
operations. 
	Preventing injuries and ill health, 
providing safe and healthy working 
conditions 
	Promoting safe behavior and 
empowering our colleagues to lead  
by example 
We continuously work to ensure that 
we act responsibly and are accountable 
for our actions. Our procedures to stop 
any unsafe work are firm and encourage 
intervention, we prohibit the possession 
and consumption of illegal substances and 
alcohol at worksites. These commitments 
exist because they are in the best interest 
of PGS employees and stakeholders and 
are essential for the long-term business 
success of the Company.// Social
// PGS ESG Report 2020
25Gamified Learning for HSEQ Traning// Social // Case Study
PGS has a well-established HSEQ training 
system, which provides the framework for 
defining HSEQ competence and training 
requirements. We focus on four core HSEQ 
competencies:  
	HSEQ requirements and best practice 
	HSEQ principles, management system  
and compliance 
	Risk management  
(including emergency response) 
	Auditing techniques and quality assurance  
Minimum training and competence requirements 
are identified for all employees with HSEQ 
responsibility, based on a HSEQ Competence  
and Training Matrix. Research shows that applying what has been 
learned to real-world situations strengthens an 
individual’s focus and determination to learn. 
Therefore, we introduced gamified learning in 
PGS. A gamified app has been developed in 
cooperation with Attensi AS. In the app game, 
available for phone and tablets, crew members 
play through different scenarios and dilemmas 
related to HSEQ and gain points for correct 
answers. This training is mandatory for all 
crew and replaces some of the courses from 
the existing HSEQ competence and training 
matrix. We hope to achieve a higher degree of 
engagement of HSEQ training by using modern 
technology, with the goal of improving risk 
awareness and management. Going forward, 
our plan is to use the platform for courses in our 
global training catalog. 
// PGS ESG Report 2020
26Hazard Identification and Risk Management
In 2020, we updated the PGS Risk Register to 
capture and identify any changes in identified 
major hazards in the workplace. The register 
provides an overview of all processes and 
the pre-and post-mitigation risk. For each 
process, the hazard, risk, controls, and recovery 
measures are identified. The controls are split 
into administrative controls, engineering 
controls, and procedures. All these hazards 
and risks are regulated by our integrated 
management system (IMS). The IMS consists 
of a set of procedures and work instructions. 
The operational procedures and work 
instructions have been developed by crew 
members and support functions within PGS. 
Safety-critical tasks that are vessel specific 
have been developed using risk assessment 
techniques and job safety analysis. 
PGS crewmembers carry out job safety 
analysis and risk assessments for all 
safety-critical tasks where the hazards 
and control measures need to be assessed. 
These processes are used to verify the 
hazard management of established 
procedures or work instructions.  
	Examples of the most common areas 
where hazards are identified include: 
	Routine jobs that have a potential for 
serious incidents 
	Routine jobs that have a history of 
incidents, including near misses 
	New jobs or jobs introducing new work 
methods (e.g. introduction of new 
equipment) 
	Non-routine or “one-off” jobs that have 
a potential for incidents 
We have remedial plans in place for 
operations, which are logged in the PGS HSEQ 
reporting system with action holder and 
target date. This plan is reviewed annually 
and controlled by setting key performance 
indicators for the relevant stakeholders. Managing the Covid-19 Crisis
PGS has monitored developments 
closely since the outbreak of the Covid-19 
pandemic and taken prompt and proactive 
actions to manage the situation as 
it affects our business. We operate 
in compliance with all national and 
international authorities and regulations 
regarding implemented restrictions on 
travel, quarantine, and isolation. We 
are supported by International SOS, our 
medical and security services provider, and 
work closely with our industry network 
and clients to ensure we have the best 
situational awareness and response. 
To ensure the safety of our employees and 
business continuity through the pandemic, 
we have implemented strict protocols 
to prevent an outbreak of Covid-19 in our 
offices and in particular on our vessels. 
All personnel travelling to a PGS vessel 
are subject to strict quarantine and test 
requirements before being allowed to 
board. In the absence of national guidelines 
all personnel are required to undergo a 
minimum 7 days of quarantine and return a 
negative Reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test before boarding. 
After boarding, an additional 7-day 
precautionary period of social distancing, 
face masks and strict hygiene measures are 
implemented. The modern and spacious 
design of our vessels enable crew to sustain 
operations while maintaining safe distance. 
If after 14 days since starting the quarantine 
no one is exhibiting any symptoms 
indicating Covid-19 all measures are lifted 
and the vessel can operate as normal.  
As our understanding of the disease is 
constantly evolving, we are continuously 
working on adjusting our strict onboard 
mitigations and do utmost to keep our 
crews safe. 
In 2020, we had zero incidents of personnel 
with Covid-19 onboard our vessels during 
seismic surveys.// Social
// PGS ESG Report 2020
27Crew Change in the Covid-19 Era// Social // Case Study
Crew change is an important and challenging part 
of any marine seismic operation. It is particularly 
true for a highly diverse company like PGS that 
employs skilled professionals from all over the 
world on its vessels. Crew changes can be complex, 
however since March 2020, the differences in 
government response to the worldwide Covid-19 
pandemic have made crewing significantly more 
challenging and complicated. 
Before Covid-19, crew change dates for all vessels 
were known at least 12 months in advance. The 
duration of each trip was fixed. The core crew for 
each vessel was known. Since March 2020, crew 
changes have been among the highest risks to 
our vessel operations. Because PGS regards the 
safety of its crew as its highest priority, if that 
risk were not mitigated to an acceptable level, 
operations could be stopped or delayed. 
Throughout 2020, crew change dates were 
based on a compromise between operational 
needs, availability of air transportation, and 
preventing crew burnout. Trips were extended 
for up to 10 weeks, to limit the amount of travel 
and provide more time for crew change planning. Crewmembers that joined shifts in February for 
a five-week deployment were still at sea in May.  
At home, many crewmembers on break were 
not able to leave their country of residence.  This 
quickly developing situation created significant 
logistical challenges that the operations 
department had to overcome if we were to 
remain in production. 
Each vessel had specific guidelines and 
instructions for each crew change. Regular crew 
change planning meetings were held (at least 
weekly) prior to crew change, to determine 
crew availability, if they could leave their 
home country, if they could enter the country 
where the vessel was located, to get the crew 
safely to the vessel and the off-signers home. 
Teleconference meetings were held with the on-
signing crew prior to crew change, to explain the 
crew change plans and provide an opportunity 
for crewmembers to raise any concerns. With 
each crew change, the team has learned valuable 
lessons and made improvements for the next.

28Training and Education
We provide, promote, and encourage 
learning and development opportunities 
for all our employees. We make sure that 
employees understand their role and that 
performance and development goals are 
defined and followed-up through dialog 
and feedback. 
Our performance management process is 
designed to help people perform at their best 
by motivating them to achieve or surpass 
their goals. The process is designed to be 
fair, transparent, and consistent, clearly 
linking reward to individual performance.  
A formal performance discussion between 
the employee and their manager is held at 
least once a year, in which goals, execution, 
and development needs are reviewed. 
We identify talented employees by 
evaluating and discussing their potential  
at a senior level across business units.  
Our employee-survey results have highlighted that providing improved 
professional and personal development is 
important and we are concentrating our 
efforts to further improve our processes.  
To upgrade employee skills and enhance  
our talent development opportunities,  
we are taking the following actions:  
	Coaching managers and employees  
	Offering temporary assignments to 
stretch peoples’ capabilities, in their 
current location or another office 
	Focusing on internal recruitment to  
fill vacancies  
	In some cases, offering special services 
from external consultants to support 
individuals and groups and ensure 
development to meet individual and 
collective business needs. // Social

29Our Digital Transformation Progress// Social // Case Study
The digital transformation journey we had embarked on a few years 
back was sharply accelerated by the unplanned events of 2020. 
Digitalization will be crucial for our post-Covid recovery, including  
use of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  
We managed to achieve significant progress in 
areas such as: 
	A new cloud-native platform for seismic 
imaging – PGS Eos 
	Managing a cloud-enabled fleet – PGS 
Proteus - predictive maintenance, optimized 
vessel speeds, and productivity improvements

32PGS Eos — Imaging in the Cloud
Collaborative platform  
Managing finite resources  
Faster when it counts
Through our cloud-enabled PGS Eos platform, 
we look forward to fully utilizing the benefits of 
the cloud to deliver reliable and timely results to 
our clients. This initiative has potential to access 
unlimited compute capacity and application of 
the latest technology. We have begun our first 
commercial imaging project  in the cloud. 
We have also started leveraging machine 
learning and artificial intelligence in seismic imaging, to improve our velocity model building, 
allowing for faster convergence to the final 
velocity model. What used to take months, now 
takes weeks. Further, a proof-of-concept project 
by our Imaging teams to identify patterns 
in historic processing sequences shows that 
seismic processing parameter extraction may 
produce equivalent seismic quality by using 
historical trends, thereby minimizing testing  
and accelerating data delivery.

33Governance
PGS is committed to providing a positive, inclusive, 
and sustainable working environment. We are a 
contributing member to Transparency International 
Norway. We treat all individuals fairly. We adhere to the 
International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Core Conventions 
on Labor Standards, the United Nation’s (UN) Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and applicable labor 
standards. We do not tolerate any breaches of these 
principles and work towards ensuring employees feel 
confident in raising concerns to management without 
fear of retribution.  
The materiality assessment has resulted in 
the following key governance indicators: 
	Corporate governance  
	Anti-corruption 
	Tax 
	Anti-competitive behavior 
	Economic performance 
// PGS ESG Report 2020
34Corporate Governance
Our corporate governance model is based 
on the Norwegian Code of Practice for 
Corporate Governance. We operate on a 
regular basis in countries with elevated 
risk of corruption. We recognize that our 
future success depends on maintaining the 
highest standards of corporate governance 
for the way we conduct our business, 
deliver our services, and create value for  
our shareholders. 
PGS has built a value set that provides the 
foundation for all our goals, policies, and 
actions. These offer clear guidelines on how 
we expect everyone at PGS to interact with 
their colleagues, suppliers, customers, and 
the people we encounter in our day-to-day 
work. We are committed to living our core 
values and to conducting our business with 
the utmost integrity. We hold ourselves to 
high ethical standards in all our business 
dealings around the world. 
The PGS Board of Directors is responsible 
for establishing appropriate guidelines, 
monitoring, and ensuring that internal risk 
management systems are in place. We 
regularly review and update our governing 
documents to reflect changes in best 
practice and the evolving risks we face. 
Anti-corruption
Compliance with laws, rules, and 
regulations, including anti-corruption laws 
applicable to the conduct of our business 
activities, is a fundamental part of the 
PGS Code of Conduct. Our anti-corruption 
program reflects the Company’s promise 
to its shareholders, customers, and 
other stakeholders to operate legally and 
ethically. It is based on best practice and 
standards, including but not limited to 
Norwegian law and practice, the UK Bribery 
Act, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA),and the ISO Standard for Anti-
bribery Management Systems 37001. The 
program addresses the corruption risks in 
relation to PGS’ business, and monitors compliance. It is established on the 
following key principles:  
	Tone from the top 
	Policies and procedures 
	Risk assessments 
	Due diligence 
	Communication and training  
	Monitoring and review  
The program includes a clear, practical, 
accessible, effectively implemented and 
enforced system of controls to prevent, 
detect, and respond to corruption and bribery.  
Anti-corrutption Risk Assessments
We perform stakeholder analysis, context 
analyses, and a group risk-assessment that 
address all PGS locations and activities 
on an annual basis. In addition, each year 
we do a global likelihood-of-corruption-
exposure assessment, by country. In 
this assessment, the starting point is 
Transparency International’s CPI, which is 
adjusted for the likelihood of PGS business, 
activities, and presence in the respective 
countries. As such, all our operations are 
assessed for risks related to corruption. 
We are currently upgrading our measuring 
system to become even more effective. 
At activity or transaction level, we 
use several processes to conduct risks 
assessments in advance of conducting an 
activity. Corruption risks are an integrated 
part of these. In 2020, through our group 
corruption risk assessment, we identified 
four inherently significant or high risks to 
PGS linked to Interacting with government 
officials (two risks), use of agents (one risk) 
and joint ventures (one risk). 
We perform risk assessments or pre-
qualification assessments of our suppliers. 
Integrity due diligence is performed on 
business partners, to provide pre-defined 
‘exposing services’ and where the assessed 
inherent risk is greater than Low. Due // Governance
// PGS ESG Report 2020
35diligence on existing business partners is 
repeated at a frequency defined by the 
assessed risk level. 
Communicating and Trainin on Anti-corruption  
Policies and Procedures
We have a well-established system 
for communicating and training our 
stakeholders on our anti-corruption 
program.  The PGS Audit Committee receive 
regular information, updates, and training 
regarding the anti-corruption program. 
In addition, each year the full Board of 
Directors and all members of our executive 
management respond to questions about 
critical governance requirements, including 
anti-corruption. 
All PGS employees are also reminded of 
our policies and procedures, and regularly 
informed of any changes to our anti-
corruption program through intranet 
articles, e-learning, in-person training, emails from the CEO and their line 
managers. We also provide anti-corruption 
onboarding, to train all new employees. 
In 2020, 97 % of PGS onshore employees 
and maritime officers received e-learning0. 
In addition, vessel crew receive onboard 
training and office-based employees in 
exposed roles receive in-person training. 
Our key business partners are required to 
provide annual confirmations of compliance, 
which include elements about our anti-
corruption program. This applies to business 
partners with an inherent exposure level. 
Failure to file this confirmation means  
PGS will not use the supplier. PGS makes 
these requirements clear in contractual 
clauses and repeats them during audits  
and management meetings. // Governance

36Tax
PGS operates with a range of legal 
entities across several tax jurisdictions 
and regulatory schemes, in countries with 
varying regulatory schemes. The main 
objective of our tax strategy is to ensure 
PGS is a responsible corporate citizen by 
paying taxes when legally due, and to 
minimize tax expense based on strong 
professional integrity and in compliance 
with tax laws and regulations. We ensure 
timely and accurate reporting and filings 
of tax returns. All tax risks are carefully 
evaluated for tax planning and tax advisory. 
We ensure all tax planning has commercial 
and economic substance, and we have a 
pro-active approach to tax audits.  
Our tax department is responsible for 
planning, compliance, and controversies 
/ requests from tax authorities. Our tax 
strategy includes corporate income tax, 
withholding taxes, employee taxes including 
for crew and expats, indirect taxes such as 
VAT/GST, duties and import taxes. Explicit 
standards in our management system set 
requirements for proactive tax planning, 
compliance, accounting, and audit handling.Anti-competitive Behavior  
and Economic Performance
There is considerable focus on fair 
competition in the seismic industry, both 
from industry organizations such as IAGC, 
governments, and clients. PGS engages 
from time to time in joint-ventures and 
collaboration projects with other companies 
within the seismic industry. PGS has 
developed policies and guidelines to ensure 
that these projects are conducted well 
within the boundaries of applicable anti-
trust/competition law. The nature of such 
projects may differ. An example is joint 
seismic data production projects, which 
typically will yield more seismic data to the 
market at a lower cost to our customers. 
No legal actions have been pending or 
completed during 2020 regarding anti-
competitive behavior or violations of anti-
trust and monopoly legislation in which 
PGS has been identified as a participant. 
The economic value created for our 
stakeholders is communicated in our 
Annual Report, which also details the 
financial assistance received from the 
Norwegian government.// Governance
// PGS ESG Report 2020
37Our Data to Clients Faster and Easier// Governance // Case Study
PGS’ partnership with TGS and CGG on a 
shared MultiClient ecosystem for accessing 
subsurface data, is a new milestone in digital 
transformation for our industry. 
The independent cloud-based system will offer 
a single access point to all three companies’ 
MultiClient data libraries, allowing customers 
to find, visualize and download their subsurface 
assets and entitlements. This will also provide 
a shop window from which clients can identify 
surveys of interest. They will then be passed to 
each vendor’s environment for data visualization 
and further engagement. The MultiClient 
libraries will not be commercially combined. This partnership is complementary to the PGS 
Solis initiative, for cloud-enabled MultiClient 
data access. PGS is cooperating with Cognite and 
Cognizant to develop this PGS-specific platform 
that will allow clients to directly access and act 
on PGS Multiclient data in the cloud or download 
it to their own environment. 
Based on strong client interest, we expect to 
commercialize this initiative during the first half 
of 2021, by signing up customers for seismic 
data management as a service. 
// PGS ESG Report 2020
38Human Rights and Supplier Conduct
Everywhere it operates, PGS complies with 
applicable laws and regulations within 
the fields of human and workers’ rights. 
In addition, we also adhere to Principles 
1-6 of the UN Global Compact, the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, 
the International Bill of Rights, UN 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(1948), the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, and the ILO 
core conventions. PGS also adheres in its 
worldwide operations to the standards in 
the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015).  We are determined that our suppliers 
also should adhere to these standards. 
To ensure this, we regularly do perform 
diligence assessments and conduct audits 
on our supply chain. We ensure that our 
procurement and contracting processes 
adhere to PGS’ requirements in respect 
of ethics, anti-corruption, HSEQ, export 
control, and sanctions. We are currently 
developing a PGS Supplier Code of 
Conduct, which we plan to roll out in 2021. 
Our ambition is to reduce supply-chain 
risk, ensure the supply of goods at right 
quality, quantity, time and place, capture 
economies of scale, and ensure the best 
possible terms and conditions for PGS.
