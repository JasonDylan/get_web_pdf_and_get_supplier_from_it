2MESSAGE FROM 
THE PRESIDENT
Dear Readers,
The first quarter of 2020 was marked by a quite challeng-
ing global macroeconomic scenario, due to COVID-19 
pandemic, which led to a slowdown in the Brazilian econ-
omy and in the other countries where we operate, what 
resulted in a significant demand reduction for the most 
part of industries, affecting mainly durable goods seg-
ments, such as transportation, infrastructure and con-
struction. On the other side, since the beginning of sec -
ond quarter we have been observing a demand recovery 
in all sectors at the regions where operate.  
With regard to petrochemical sector, the challenges 
imposed by the pandemic smoothened the down cycle 
that has been affecting the industry since 2018 given 
the lower growth of global economy. Additionally, the 
fall in oil prices at the beginning of the year, caused by 
the increase in Saudi Arabia production, after tensions 
with Russia on the context of OPEP discussions, affect-
ed positively the petrochemical industry due to com-
petitive prices of raw material. In this respect, the most 
recent projections by external consulting firms have 
improved petrochemical spreads in relation of its initial 
expectations for 2020.
Within this scenario, we have reinforced our commitment 
to the society, by acting cooperatively  in the production 
of materials for combating the pandemic; to the com-
munities, by donating essential materials; to our clients, 
by attending their needs with timeliness, resiliency and 
quality; to our team members, by providing health and 
safety support; to our shareholders, by preserving our 
cash position and maintaining our financial robustness; and to the sustainable development, by advancing in the 
climate change and circular economy agendas. 
Cooperation and global 
coordination to face the pandemic
Due to the recent impacts of the pandemic on society 
as a whole, our central focus has been on the safety of 
people and reliability of our operations, since our busi-
ness is deemed essential to fight the pandemic, as we 
are part of the chain of supply of hospital, hygiene and 
packaging products. In this regard, we have reinforced 
our goal of improving people’s lives through chemistry 
and plastic, and adopted collaboration measures for 
such a delicate moment for our society. Said measures 
included (i) donating resins and other materials to the 
manufacture of 60 million masks, 750 thousand liters 
of gel hand sanitizer and hospital-grade protection 
masks; (ii) supporting the communities, donating gro-
cery hampers to 1.2 thousand families that work with 
recycling, and hygiene products to 50 thousand families 
that live in the areas surrounding our operations, and 
we have also supported the building of the field hospital 
in Alagoas; (iii) supporting clients, with a special credit 
facility for small- and medium-sized companies; and 
(iv) the safety of our members, with reduced teams for 
production, lock-in, reinforcement of HSE practices, re-
mote work for members that are part of the risk groups 
and for those who work at the offices, as well as medical 
support for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases.
3Our results’ resiliency
Despite the challenging scenario and the development of 
the geological phenomenon in Maceió, the strategy de-
fined by the Company, and which has been implemented 
since 2010, focusing on geographic and feedstock diver -
sification and on competitiveness and productivity, was 
crucial for the Company to have a free cash generation 
of R$ 3 billion in the year, influenced mainly by working 
capital optimizations, tax credits monetization (PIS/CO-
FINS), strengthening client’s loyalty thru advanced pay-
ments for future sale, and the reduction of payments of 
Brazilian IR/CSLL taxes. Such effects made up for the 
decrease of the Company’s recurrent EBITDA in Reais, 
mostly due to the smaller spreads in the international 
market, especially that of polyethylene.
In 2020, the challenges remain and our results reinforce our 
business resiliency, as a result of the strategy that we have 
been developing. The flexibility of our operation allowed us 
to keep producing and timeliness attending to our clients’ 
needs, by production optimization and capturing synergies 
among our global units. Besides that, due to the supplier’s 
diversification strategy, we have increased the crackers 
utilization rate in Mexico, thru the development of Fast 
Track solution to import ethane from United States. 
Furthermore, during this year, we concluded the con-
struction of our new polypropylene plant at La Porte, 
Texas, which has 450 thousand tons of production per 
year. The new plant is aligned with our strategy of feed-
stock diversification and geographical expansion in the 
Americas, reinforcing our leadership position on poly-
propylene production at United States.
Commitment to the  
environment, the society and 
corporate governance
In relation to the progress regarding the environment 
front, we were recognized as an A-List Company for 
the Water and Climate CDP indexes, for the 2018 man-
agement. We have also expanded our I’m green™ brand, 
which now includes recycled resins from our Circular 
Economy business, which sold over 1.6 thousand tons of 
items of recycled origin in 2019. In addition, in 2020 we 
reached a reduction of 19,3% on GHG emissions inten-
sity, scope 1 and 2, regarding 2008 baseline. With regard of Circular Economy, we have started stud-
ies in partnership with EngePol – Polymers Engineering 
Laboratory (EngePol) of the Alberto Luiz Coimbra Insti-
tute for Postgraduate Studies and Engineering Research 
of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (COPPE/
UFRJ) - and with the training institute SENAI CETIQT, 
through the SENAI Innovation in Biosynthetics and Fi-
bers Institute, to develop the technology needed for 
chemical recycling, that transforms post-consumption 
plastic into pyrolysis oil, used as feedstock to produce 
new polymers. In 2020, we have advanced in this topic, 
signing a new cooperation agreement to formalize next 
stages of the research, which target to develop cata-
lysts to improve the quality of products generated by 
the chemical recycling process.
Besides such advances, we also have signed one more 
agreement to purchase renewable energy, in alignment 
with our strategy to expand the use of clean energies in 
its industrial operations. This is the third agreement for 
the purchase of competitive renewable energy signed 
by Braskem, which is nearing the mark of 1 million tons 
of CO₂ emissions avoided through the use of solar and 
wind power purchase agreements. 
We have also made progress in our relationship with the 
communities. In 2019, our private social investments, 
along with the global volunteering program, have bene-
fited over 533 thousand people, which is more than twice 
the number of beneficiaries in relation to the previous 
year. Out of this number, 94 thousand people have bene-
fited only from the program, which had a record number 
of volunteers. All of these achievements are the fruit of 
our purpose, which is to improve people’s lives through 
sustainable solutions regarding chemistry and plastic.
Moreover, in order to get through all the challenges of 
the year, achieve our goals and move towards our stra-
tegic ambition, the central role played by our members 
has been and still is fundamental. By sharing respect, 
responsibility, and an ethical and transparent behavior, 
we delivered value to all our stakeholders, in a daily and 
committed work. For such, we have also worked on im-
plementing our BeUx proposal of value, to provide our 
members with significant experiences aligned with their 
goals and values. One of the highlights for the construc -
tion of said experience was the Diversity and Inclusion 
Program, which has completed 5 years and achieved 
4important acknowledgments, such as the Women in 
Leadership Latin America award, which recognized 
Braskem as the best Brazilian company in the devel-
opment of actions to increase representativeness and 
inclusion of women in leadership, and the bronze cate-
gory in the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) 
award of the United Nations, which acknowledges good 
practices to promote gender equality.
People’s safety is a non-negotiable value for us. In 2019, 
the total recordable injury rate was 1.31, an increase of 
20% compared to the previous year. Committed with 
this value, we have strengthened our human reliability 
program with initiatives that reinforce the importance 
of a culture of accident prevention. The enhancement 
of this culture it is already showing good results, and 
the total recordable injury rate was 0,92 as of the third 
quarter of 2020.
Also in 2020, DoJ (Department of Justice), SEC (Secu-
rities Exchange) and MPF (Federal Prosecution Office) 
certified our compliance system, after three years of 
evaluation and implementation of improvements ap-
pointed by the external and independent monitorship. 
The decision was based on a final report from the in-
dependent monitors, who certified that the Company 
implemented all the recommendations regarding the 
structure and execution of its compliance program.
During the independent monitoring process, we im-
plemented controls designed to comply with anti-cor -
ruption laws and mechanisms to ensure the adequacy 
and effectiveness of integrity practices, preventing 
the occurrence of new wrongdoings and giving utmost 
priority to ethics and transparency in conducting its 
business, all of which were evaluated in detail and test-
ed by the monitors. 
Safety and support to  
the families in Maceió
With regard to the geological phenomenon in the City 
of Maceió, State of Alagoas, we  reaffirmed our commit-
ment to the safety of people and the communities in 
its area of operation, by: (i) permanently shutting down 
salt mining activities in Maceió and creating protective 
areas around certain wells, which involves relocating 
people, vacating properties and adopting addition-al monitoring activities; (ii) signing an agreement with 
the Alagoas State Public Defender’s Office, the Federal 
Prosecution Office, the Federal Public Defender’s Office 
and the Alagoas State Prosecution Office for supporting 
the relocation and compensation of residents in the risk 
areas through the Financial Compensation and Support 
for Relocation Program; and (iii) signing an agreement 
with the Labor Prosecution Office for implementing the 
Program to Recover Business and Promote Education 
for residents and workers in the same four districts. 
In this sense, and to the best of its knowledge, the 
Company recognized, at the time, with a provision in 
the fourth quarter result, the total amount of approx -
imately R$ 3.4 billion related to the implementation of 
these actions, which will be spent over the next few 
years and may be changed due to the development 
of the topic. At the end of the third quarter of 2020, 
after updates to the studies regarding the region, the 
Company had approximately R$ 7 .9 billion in provisions. 
In relation to our actions in the community, around 2 
thousand families have already been added to the 
agreement and 6.5 thousand families had already been 
relocated by September of this same year. We contin-
ue to constantly collaborate with the authorities to 
deal with all the impacts of this event.
Looking to the future,  
acting in the present
We live in an increasingly globalized, integrated and 
dynamic world; thus, as the scenarios change and 
uncertainties increase, we undertook to use our ut-
most efforts to strengthen our strategy, adaptability 
and resilience capacity, striving to provide prosperous 
and consistent results to all our stakeholders. Thus, we 
stayed on track to achieve our ambition of leading sus -
tainable chemistry at a global level.
I would like to thank our Shareholders once again for 
trusting Braskem; our Clients, which are fundamental 
partners for us to continue seeking solutions through 
chemistry and plastic in order to improve people’s lives, 
and our Members, Partners and Suppliers, for their ded-
ication and competence, which are essential to our 
achievements and results, for an increasingly global and 
sustainable Braskem. Lastly, I would like to invite you to 
read the 2019 Braskem Integrated Report.

rochemical plants), we crack petroleum products and natural 
gas (naphtha, ethane, and propane), in addition to ethanol. 
This process is mainly aimed at the production of ethylene, 
propylene, butadiene, benzene, toluene, paraxylene, cumene, 
gasoline and caustic soda, among others.
In our second-generation plants in the chemical industry, we 
transform ethylene and propylene obtained in the first-gen-
eration, as well as those supplied by third parties, into ther -
moplastic resins: PE, PP and PVC. Our chemicals and thermo-
plastic resins are sold to Clients that transform them into final 
products that meet people’s needs, such as:Generation2stGeneration1nd

We have adopted a competitive and transparent com-
pensation strategy, which seeks to attract, develop 
and retain the best professionals and compensate our 
administrators based on market practices, according 
to their duties and responsibilities in the effective con-
duct of business. The practice of variable compensation 
allows to strengthen the alignment of interests of our 
shareholders with those of our administrators in ob-
taining and exceeding short- and long-term results.

21Between 2016 and 2020, our 
compliance system was subjected 
to the external and independent 
monitor’s evaluation. During this 
process, more than 80 corporate 
policies and directive guidelines 
were reviewed, as well as more 
than 40 process.COMPLIANCE
For us, compliance is more than simply complying with 
laws, standards and guidance documents and avoiding, 
detecting and treating any deviation or non-compli-
ance that may occur, but it means embracing the spirit 
of integrity, identifying ethical behavior as a competitive 
advantage and making what is right out of conviction.
Conducting our business with ethics, transparency, 
integrity and in compliance with applicable laws is 
one of our main values as a company, which must be 
reflected in all our actions and interactions with all 
our stakeholders.OUR COMPLIANCE SYSTEM
Since 2016, we have invested and strongly improved 
the construction of a system capable of leading our or -
ganization along a path of compliance with applicable 
standards, and worldwide best governance practices, in 
addition to ensuring conduct based on ethical principles 
and values that protect and strengthen the company 
and all of our stakeholders.
Our Compliance System is, therefore, a set of measures 
that aim to prevent, detect and remedy, in a systemic 
way, the occurrence of unethical, illegal and misaligned 
conduct with laws, rules and guidance documents, fa-
voring an environment of commitment with what is 
right, where incompatible attitudes are not tolerated. 
It is based on 10 measures, structured on three pillars: 
Prevention, Detection and Remediation.
We understand that governance and compliance prac -
tices must be constantly updated and improved. Thus, 
the search for best practices and the implementation 
of our global compliance system resulted in significant 
changes in our business management structure.
22In 2020, after the implementation of monitors’ recommendations, MPF 
(Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office), SEC (US Securities Exchange Comission) 
and DoJ (US Departament of Justice) certified our compliance system.1GOVERNANCE FOR

25RISK MANAGEMENT 
Our business is susceptible to risks that can prevent, or 
even destroy, the search for our purpose of “improv-
ing people’s lives by creating sustainable solutions from 
chemistry and plastic.” That is why we are committed to 
identifying, assessing and addressing risks so that we can 
extend our positive impact to all of our stakeholders.
OUR RISK  
MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Our global risk management methodology is cycli-
cal and identifies, understands and responds to risks 
based on international references (ISO 31000 and 
COSO ERM) with adaptations to specific situations, 
considering our culture. 
This methodology aims to ensure that our decisions 
are made based on timely and sufficient informa-
tion regarding the risks to which we are exposed, 
thus increasing the probability of reaching our ob-
jectives and reducing risks to acceptable levels. It 
also seeks to preserve our tangible and intangible 
assets, the safety of people and the integrity of the 
environment and communities.

Both require a priority action plan to manage the causes and risk factors. These plans are 
independently monitored and reported to our Board of Directors every four periodically.
High
MediumThey represent situations that are normally inherent to the operations or 
incorporated to our operating cost, but require close monitoring. Our Business 
Areas are responsible for prioritizing and monitoring these risks and reporting them 
every four months to the vice-president of the business unit involved.
Low They are considered acceptable, with no need for monitoring or mitigation actions.OUR RISK MATRIX
In the Risk Analysis and Assessment phase, our leaders are responsible for assessing the causes and sources of risks, 
their positive and negative consequences and the likelihood that they will materialize and cause an impact that is not 
in line with our expectations. In the next phase, we select the risks that require targeting and prioritizing the necessary 
initiatives to respond to the main threats to which we are exposed. The result of the risk impact assessment, its prob-
ability of occurrence and the prioritization allows the classification of risks as very high, high, medium and low, and the 
subsequent positioning thereof in our Priority Risk Matrix.
See more detail of our Risk Management on:  
https:/ /www.braskem.com/RI/detail-bylaws-and-policies/braskems-governance-and-compliance-policiesRISK DICTIONARY
Strategic RisksAssociated with strategic decisions to achieve our business objectives and/
or resulting from our lack of capacity or ability to protect ourselves or adapt to 
changes in the environment. Examples: Risks of market share losses (“Market Share”), 
commodity price conditions, purchases and acquisitions of companies, etc.
Operational 
RisksDue to the lack of consistency and adequacy of the information, processing and operational 
control systems, as well as failures in the management of resources, and in the internal 
controls or frauds that render improper the performance of our activities. Examples: producing 
and distributing products in disagreement with the established conditions and deadlines, 
exposure to labor claims in plants or lack of formalization of contracts with third parties.
Financial RisksAssociated with financial decisions arising from the financial market, credit and liquidity to honor 
commitments. Examples:
Market Risks: arise from the possibility of losses that may be caused by changes in the behavior of 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the prices of our shares and the prices of commodities.
Credit Risks: defined as the possibility of loss resulting from the uncertainty regarding the receipt of 
amounts agreed with borrowers, contract counterparties or issue of securities.
Liquidity Risks: possibilities of loss resulting from the inability to carry out a transaction in a 
reasonable time and without significant loss of value or the possibility of lack of resources to honor 
the commitments assumed due to the mismatch between our assets and liabilities.
Regulatory RisksThose risks associated with the regulatory environment that may result in legal or regulatory 
sanctions, financial or reputation losses due to failure to comply with laws, agreements, regulations, 
Code of Conduct and/or Braskem’s guidance documents. Example: Customers or suppliers that 
deviate from the laws and that may put the Company at Risk.
28MAIN RISK FACTORS 
IDENTIFIED
The risks described here are classified as strategic risks, 
with high probability of occurrence and priority action. 
Disposal of Plastic 
One of our mapped risks is the consumption trend that 
has been installed to avoid the use of plastic, due to the 
impacts that its improper disposal can cause to the en-
vironment. This trend has been supported by govern-
ments and law-makers, as well as guided investments 
in collection and recycling by petrochemical compa-
nies and other members of the plastic chain. Thus, the 
growing concern with the use of plastic brings poten-
tial risks of substituting the use of this product, which 
would directly impact Braskem’s results.
Our actions
With this in mind, in 2018, Braskem positioned itself 
in favor of the “Circular Economy” (reuse of resources 
within the economy), establishing 8 strategic pillars 
for its operations
See more details on:  
https:/ /www.braskem.com/principal/circulareconomyCyclicality in the  
Petrochemical sector
The petrochemical industry, including the global mar -
kets in which we operate, is cyclical and sensitive to 
global changes in supply and demand.
Historically, the international petrochemical product 
markets have undergone alternating periods of limit-
ed supply, which has led to increased prices and profit 
margins, followed by expansion in production capaci-
ty, resulting in excess supply and decreased prices and 
profit margins. Prices in the petrochemical sector follow 
the global petrochemical sector, and the prices of our 
products sold in Brazil, Latin America, the United States 
and around the world are set with reference to inter -
national market prices. Therefore, our net sales revenue 
and our gross margin are increasingly related to con-
ditions in the global industry, over which we have no 
control, which may have an impact on the Company’s 
operating results and financial condition.
Our actions 
Over the time and within our business strategy, we have 
been working in several actions that allowed us to mit-
igate risks arising from down cycles in the petrochem-
ical industry, mainly supported by three pillars of risk 
diversification: (i) feedstock diversification; (ii) suppliers 
diversification; and (iii) geographic diversification.
29Climate Change
The issue of climate change, which is related to the 
emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, 
is treated as a potential risk for Braskem, since it can 
cause possible situations of stress in relation to the 
natural resources used in our production, such as 
water resources, and also by increasingly demanding 
regulations regarding the intensity of emissions of 
carbon dioxide and the like. 
Our actions
However, the Company has been working on this front 
since 2008, when we launched our Climate Change Ad-
aptation and Mitigation plan, which consists of detect-Since 2008, we have reduced the 
intensity of scope 1 and 2 emissions in 
our operations by approximately 19.2%.ing potential risks and business opportunities related to 
climate changes. Since then, within the scope of miti-
gation, we carry out an annual inventory of greenhouse 
gas emissions, verifying scopes 1, 2 and 3, that are ap-
plicable to our business, which serves as a basis for im-
plementing initiatives to reduce the emission of these 
gases in our operation. In this sense, we have adopted 
reduction targets by 2030.
With regard to adaptation, we mapped all climate risks in the regions where we have operations and adopted action 
plans to mitigate and reduce the most significant ones. About 58 high risks have been identified, with a potential fi-
nancial impact of US$ 175 million by 2040. The plan is to reduce these high risks to zero by 2023.2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019-19.2

30EXTERNAL 
ENVIRONMENT
The year was marked by the deepening in trade tensions 
between China and the United States, the two largest eco-
nomic powers in the world, which began in the first half of 
2018. These tensions influenced world trade as a whole, 
due to uncertainties and challenges imposed by protec -
tionist measures in both countries - there was a negative 
impact on investment and demand for capital goods. Ad-
ditionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy, the con-
traction of the European automotive industry, the uncer -
tainties related to Brexit and the political instability in the 
main emerging markets, such as Brazil and Mexico, result-
ed in lower growth in the industrial sector and international 
trade in 2019.THE WORLD IN 2019

INDUSTRY IN 2019
The trade war between the United States and Chi-
na influenced the global demand for chemicals and 
thermoplastic resins, which affected said demand 
throughout the year, but below the initial expectation 
of players and consultants in the petrochemical sec -
tor for 2019. In this context, the spread of polyethylene 
and chemicals in the world was also pressured by the 
entry of new integrated capacities of shale gas, eth-
ane-based polyethylene in the United States and new 
refineries in Asia. On the other hand, the US PP market 
continued with healthy spreads, due to the growth of 
the US economy and the large availability of raw mate-
rial propylene in the region.
Since 2018, it was expected that the polyethylene 
market would enter a phase of low prices, due to the 
entry of new refineries in Asia and, mainly, by the 
entry of new capacities of shale gas, ethane-based 
polyethylene in the United States.
Since the beginning of 
2020, the expectations on 
petrochemical spreads for 
the year have increased, due 
to lower supply caused by 
the downturn in the global 
economy, which was affected 
by the pandemic scenario.

33Our way of being BeUx
In order for the people involved in our business to be 
motivated and inspired by our belief, our purpose and 
our ambition, and so that they can build innovative 
and sustainable chemical and plastic solutions with us 
from non-negotiable values, constant work is neces -
sary of immersion and development of the members 
and leaders in relation to our way of being Braskem.
It is our way of being that moves us forward. It is the 
key that establishes relationships based on trust and 
admiration; that creates a diverse, humane, inclusive 
and innovative environment that encourages protag-
onism in each one of us, while it makes us grow to-
gether; which strengthens and encourages ethical be-
havior, the zeal for safety and health, and the passion 
for transforming in all our actions, and that provokes 
us to think further, with technology as an ally of our 
transformations and our path to the future.
BeUx
The world is in transformation: more connected, 
informed, accessible and demanding more protag-
onism from people. Such changes have transformed 
the needs of Team Members in the work environ-
ment. At Braskem, we are aware of these changes 
because we want to be the company people choose 
today and in the future.Thus, in 2018, we unified our way of being in a Value 
Proposition, which permeates the entire journey of the 
member at Braskem: BeUx. With this, we aim to create a 
link between people and the organization, providing our 
Team Members with a workplace where they feel good, 
where they can build their own path, have meaningful 
experiences and access to new development tools.
We have worked in continuous improvements of our team 
members’ journey into our way of being. This journey in-
cludes Talent Attraction, Integration of new team members, 
Career Development, and their Exit from the Company.
For each stage, we obtained advances over 2019. We 
highlight the continuity of our Internship and Young 
Operators programs, and the advent of the new Re-
cruitment and Selection tool, Gupy, which has potential 
to expand diversity among our team members and to 
reduce the negative impact of unconscious bias in the 
selection of candidates.
Besides that, we worked in the layout transformation 
of our offices aiming to provide a more collaborative, 
creative and cozy environment to our team members. 
Other 2019’s highlight was Boomerang program, which 
offered team members at initial stage of their careers 
an opportunity to immerge in our global operation thru

35Commitment to ethical, upright 
and transparent performance
It is through ethical commitment, transparency, in-
tegrity and compliance with applicable laws that we 
strive to create sustainable chemical and plastic solu-
tions. These values permeate the conduct of our daily 
activities on behalf of Braskem in any location – each 
director, officer, member and third party. These are 
values that we consider non-negotiable in our way of 
being, as we understand governance and compliance 
as factors of competitiveness to achieve our ambition 
to be leaders in the sector. 
Code of conduct
We consider it essential that all our Members follow our 
Code of Conduct, doing the right thing and participating 
effectively in strengthening our organizational culture.
The Code was adopted by Braskem’s Board of Direc -
tors to establish a set of corporate conduct stan-
dards that we must adhere to in the exercise of our 
professional responsibilities and interaction with 
Braskem’s customers, shareholders, suppliers and 
business partners.
To preserve corporate security, we rely on each Mem-
ber to report in good faith any potential concerns or 
violations, the conduct of which they believe is not 
consistent with our Code.
The global Code of Conduct, therefore, presents the 
principles, values and practices that guide the corporate 
conduct of our Members both in internal and external 
relations, in an unrestricted manner, that is, without any 
room for concessions, exceptions or waivers. In 2019, all 
Members received training on the Code of Conduct, as 
did the members of the Board of Directors. Ethics Line Channel
Since 2017 , our Ethics Line Channel has been man-
aged by an outsourced and independent team, which 
receives, evaluates and forwards all complaints re-
ceived in a personalized and impartial manner. Inter -
nally, these complaints are evaluated by the specialized 
Compliance Investigation team. In addition to the on-
line channel, telephone service is available seven days 
a week, 24 hours a day, conducted in four languages 
(Portuguese, English, Spanish and German).

Improvement of our governance  
and compliance systems
Over the past few years, we have put in place new rou-
tines, new controls and reviewed various policies in or -
der to improve compliance processes and make them 
applicable globally for a diverse and multicultural team, 
with positive results for all our stakeholders.
External recognition
As a result of our efforts to seek continuous improve-
ment in our governance and compliance processes, 
we achieved a score above the market average in the 
evaluation of the Thematic Guide: Integrity, Preven-
tion and Fight against Corruption of the Ethos Insti-
tute. From the 13 selected integrity indicators, which 
assess the extent to which aspects of sustainability 
and social responsibility have been incorporated into 
the business, and helped define strategies, policies and 
processes, we have reached an overall score of 9.3.
In 2019, we saw an evolution in the 
assessment of the Ethos Institute’s 
integrity indicators, with an increase 
of approximately 7% in relation to the 
2018 score.

36Safety is our focus
The safety and health of everyone is a priority for us 
and requires continuous improvement. Thus, in 2019, 
we advanced in initiatives to improve our process 
management by continuing the implementation of In-
telius, our management system, which went through 
the process of auditing the most critical requirements 
and global standards of our plants, evaluated during 
the Gap Assessment of 2018. 
In addition, in the quest to achieve better results re-
lated to Health and Safety, we have carried out several 
actions aimed at reducing process safety risk scenar -
ios and others focusing on human reliability, such as: 
training sessions for the PUMA and ABC tools, applied 
methodologies such as root cause analysis in the in-
vestigation of incidents, focusing on human factors; development and application of games and videos, with 
the aim of disseminating the culture of human reliabili-
ty. We also developed a pilot for the analysis and identi-
fication of behavioral factors that can contribute to the 
accident profile in one of our regional offices in Brazil.
In 2019, the Accident Frequency Rate with and with-
out leave, considering members and third parties per 
million hours worked, was 1.31, above what was re-
corded in 2018.
Regarding the indicator of New or Aggravated Cases 
of Occupational Disease, 3 cases were registered in 
2019: being one in the USA and two in Brazil, all due 
to acute exposure, motivated by occasional emer -
gency situations.e emergência pontual.

Projects related to the mitigation of climatic risks, seek -
ing to develop products that contribute to capture CO₂ 
and reduce the dependence on fossil raw materials:
•  Advances in research on renewables in Campinas, fo-
cusing on proofs of concept of fermentative routes 
for production of solvents and plastics of green origin, 
in order to replace the petrochemicals used today. 
See  details of new products released on 2019 
Sustainability Report on: 
https:/ /www.braskem.com/RI/annual-reports•  Operation of a scale plant to demonstrate a cata-
lytic route for production of PET monomers from 
sugar, in Denmark;
•  6 new grades of recycled products added to the port-
folio in 2019.
39The roadmap outlined included opportunities to create 
value in critical areas such as production, supply chain, 
marketing and sales, purchasing, maintenance, corpo-
rate functions such as legal and financial, among oth-
ers. This plan aims to strengthen our position as a leader 
in the petrochemical sector and create added value for 
businesses, shareholders, customers and members.
Among the obtained results, we stand out the following: 
(i) strengthening quality control of our products and in-
dustrial process, using laser sensors and analytical tools 
and (ii) preventive maintenance of equipment, using 
digital apps, internet of things and other digital tools. 
Besides that, we implemented the processes “Push and 
Pull” which aims to identify potential improvements to 
Braskem and develop it thru several partnerships that 
boost innovation outside in.
Braskem 5.0
To support our digital transformation process, we re-
organized our Information Technology team and cre-
ated the Braskem 5.0 Program, an initiative that aims 
to align the main business challenges with opportu-
nities to adopt new technologies and processes in a 
sustainable and scalable way. The program includes 
seven pillars, namely Supply Chain and Logistics, Dig-
ital IT, New Business Models, People, Industry 4.0, En-
terprise 2.0 and Customer Experience. Among its main 
achievements, some stand out, as follows:Digital transformation

In line with our ambition to lead and be the best in 
what we do, we are always attentive to innovations 
and changes that can offer new opportunities to gen-
erate value for our stakeholders. Digital transforma-
tion is one of these opportunities to transform some 
of our processes and operations, thus increasing our 
performance and generating sustainable competitive 
advantages. We believe that our culture of agility, en-
trepreneurship, co-creation of ideas and of challenging 
and being challenged places us in a strong position to 
lead the digital evolution in the chemical industry. For 
this reason, in 2019, we launched an action plan that 
put us one step ahead of this digital transformation. . 
We have implemented a series of tools to transform stra-
tegic parts of our operations and processes in order to im-
prove business performance and reshape work practices. 
See more details in 2019  Sustainability Report on: https:/ /www.braskem.com/RI/annual-reports13 initiatives had their minimum 
viability tested and 10 of them proved 
their capacity to generate value and 
expand our leadership position in the 
digital transformation of the chemical 
industry. Starting in 2020, these 10 
initiatives may represent gains of more 
than R$ 40 million per year, a number 
that should grow exponentially as these 
solutions are scaled. 
40•  We made it possible for our Sales team to have greater 
mobility and productivity through the implementation of 
different tools, such as CRM, among others.
•  We increased our infrastructure to guarantee Members’ 
remote access to the entire Braskem network, from any-
where in the world, with quality and security.
•  We increased the productivity of our Supply Chain by 
automating transport functions, improving processes 
and providing valuable information about logistical data 
through visual panels.
•  We have evolved our back office operations through au-
tomated and intelligent processes.
•  We implemented the COBIT1 model of governance and 
change management in order to support the organiza-
tion in the areas of regulatory compliance and compli-
ance with audits.
Open innovation
The way companies innovate has changed globally and 
we are part of that change. As a way to complement 
the internal development of technological solutions, 
we form partnerships with technology institutes, uni-
versities, startups and partner companies. We believe 
that open innovation allows access to knowledge and 
technological resources that are not available inter -
nally, in addition to allowing greater agility with cost 
reduction in our technological development process. 
In 2019, we formed partnerships with 57 startups, 48 
universities and 61 partner companies.
Braskem labs
In order to contribute to the innovation ecosystem, 
generate a positive socio-environmental impact and 
solve the challenges of our business, we created the Braskem Labs platform, an entrepreneurship platform 
that accelerates ideas and business for people who 
believe in their potential to transform the world. The 
platform consists of 3 programs:
Braskem’s entrepreneurship platform focused on its 
acceleration programs, Scale and Ignition, both carried 
out in partnership with accelerator Quintessa. The 5th 
edition of the Braskem Labs Scale accelerated 12 ma-
ture startups with innovative and sustainable chemi-
cal and plastic solutions, while the Braskem Labs Igni-
tion program, aimed at initial startups, accelerated 10 
solutions with innovative and sustainable potential. In 
all, 22 startups received 4 months of acceleration with 
dozens of mentoring and business connections. Since 
2015, the Braskem Labs platform has accelerated a to-
tal of more than 70 startups that have a positive im-
pact through chemistry and plastic.
See more details in 2019 Sustainability Report on: https:/ /www.braskem.com/RI/annual-reportsThe Open Innovation and Braskem 
Labs programs maximize our ability 
to deliver sustainable and innovative 
solutions regarding chemistry and 
plastic by means of innovation and 
entrepreneurship. In 2019, US$ 459 
thousand were invested in start-up 
companies through Braskem Labs.

41As a raw material and part of the process of our man-
ufacturing, logistical and support operations, natu-
ral resources are essential to create innovative and 
sustainable solutions from chemistry and plastic. It is 
through the conscious and responsible use of these 
resources that we transform people’s lives for the bet-
ter. As a company in the chemical sector, we see our -
selves as part of the solution to address the challenges 
related to climate change and the inappropriate dis -
posal of plastic in the environment.
Circular Economy
So, our look to the future moves us today towards cir -
cular economy, so that the resources and processes 
that feed our operations are used and conducted in 
a circular and efficient manner, using more and more 
sources of renewable and recycled resources, commit-
ted to the reuse and adequate and sustainable return 
of the products of this transformation to nature.
Some of our commitments:
• Alliance to End the Plastic Waste;
• Operation Clean Sweep;
• PlasticsEurope;
• ABIQUIM;
• ANIQ;
• Plastvida;
• American Chemistry Council.CAPITAL NATURAL
Recycling Platform: includes the Company’s efforts 
in Chemical Recycling, which allows transforming 
post-consumer plastics into raw materials and chem-
icals, closing the circular economy cycle, and also in 
Mechanical Recycling, to improve the quality of recy-
cled resins, both in application properties as in organo-
leptics. It also aggregates carbon recycling efforts with 
emerging technologies to turn CO₂ into chemicals.
Development of technologies in chemical recycling:  
the Company entered into a partnership with EngePol 
- COPPE/UFRJ Polymer Engineering Laboratory (Al-
berto Luiz Coimbra Institute for Graduate Studies and 
Engineering Research at the Federal University of Rio 
de Janeiro), SENAI Institute for Innovation in Biosyn-
thetics (SENAI CETIQT) and Cetrel (an environmental 
service company that started operations in 1978, to-
gether with the Camaçari Petrochemical Complex in-
dustries), with tests at its petrochemical plant sched-
uled for the first quarter of 2020.
42Mitigation and Climate Adaptation
Also committed to the future, we seek to invest 
in projects, initiatives and partnerships that miti-
gate the adverse effects that contribute to climate 
change, that adapt our operations to potential fu-
ture risks arising from this issue and that promote 
efficiency in the use of natural resources in our 
plants and in all our processes, also in line with our 
commitment to circular economy.A strategy oriented towards 
human beings and the future 
requires the commitment 
to actions aimed at Circular 
Economy and Climate Change. 
Thus, we seek to constantly 
improve our use of natural 
resources, work towards 
mitigating potential risks arising 
from said matters, and focus 
on taking advantage of business 
opportunities that generate value 
to all our stakeholders.

44We have the ambition to be a reference in the global 
chemical industry in sustainable energy, focusing on en-
ergy efficiency and renewable energy in our operations. 
For this, we have a specialized team to conduct our ener -
gy consumption strategy, which is based on four pillars:•  Energy efficiency project for the ABC petrochemical 
complex: partnership between Braskem and Siemens for 
the modernization of the thermoelectric system at the 
ABC Complex unit reached a progress of approximate-
ly 11% with a total investment of US$ 13.3 million already 
made. With the combined co-generation of electricity and 
gas, the unit will consume less energy and emit less green-
house gases. The estimate is for a reduction of 11.4% in 
water consumption and 6.3% in CO₂ emissions of the unit. 
•  Solar-based distributed generation plant: investing 
in the diversification of the energy matrix, Braskem 
started the operation of this plant, in Bahia, which 
will work from distributed generation, a process that 
allows the customer to install renewable source 
generators, and will supply 35% of the energy used 
in Braskem’s office in Savior. The energy produced 
within a month is transformed into credit, providing a 
reduction in the amount due; 
•  Renewable Energy Purchase: a long-term agreement 
was signed with multinational Voltalia for the pur -
chase of solar energy, for a period of 20 years. This way, 
Braskem adds a competitive energy source to its port-
folio and invests in a clean and sustainable matrix. The 
Company will reduce the amount of CO₂ emissions by 
130 thousand tons over the period of the contract.Our Energy StrategyABOUT OUR BUSINESS

Thus, we have been working to acquire increasing-
ly sustainable and competitive energies. Throughout 
2019, the following fronts stood out:
45Some events that also influenced the performance of 
the indicators:
(i)  periods of more intense rain in some regions where 
the Company operates, which increased the gener -
ation of effluents; 
(ii)  higher temperatures and a worsening in the quality of 
the water acquired, which caused an increase in the 
evaporation rate of cooling towers and in the consump-
tion of fire water for cooling equipment in the summer; 
(iii)  equipment maintenance and cleaning procedures; 
(iv)  delays in scheduled shutdowns and occurrence of 
unplanned shutdowns in our plants, which impact-
ed all indicators; and 
(v)  loss of efficiency in units and equipment. These ef -
fects were partially offset by the lower generation 
of waste, due to the postponement or improve-
ment of maintenance and cleaning activities, and 
by the internal use of waste streams as fuel.Recognitions
•  For 6th consecutive year (2014-2019) we were se-
lected for the RobecoSAM Yearbook;
•  In March, Braskem was recognized as A List in the

BRASKEM WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS
In 2019, in partnership with Rede Mulher Empreendedora, we launched 
the “Braskem Women Entrepreneurs” program, which aims to train res -
idents in the region close to the Greater ABC Region (SP) and Duque de 
Caxias (RJ) Petrochemical Complexes to generate and increase income 
through employability, in addition to encouraging the promotion of busi-
nesses led by women. The program is aimed at women who wish to un-
dertake or are already in this process, formally or informally, and who have 
not had access to any type of training and are looking for professional and 
personal growth. In 2019, two classes were held that trained 57 women 
and five new businesses were created.See more details in 2019 Sustainability Report on: https:/ /www.braskem.com/RI/annual-reportsLocal Development

51Alagoas 
In the beginning of 2018, three neighborhoods in the city 
of Maceió - Pinheiro, Bebedouro and Mutange - registered 
cracks in buildings and sinking on public roads. In March of 
that year, there was an earthquake of 2.4 degrees on the 
Richter scale in these neighborhoods where Braskem has 
35 salt extraction wells, where it has been present for over 
40 years. In respect to this long relationship in the region 
and to our ethical principles, we have adopted, since the 
beginning, a responsible, transparent and active posture, 
collaborating with the authorities to understand the geo-
logical phenomenon and seeking to identify its causes.
Thus, the Company:
(i)  Definitively closed the salt extraction activities in 
Maceió, and created protection areas around certain 
wells, which involved the relocation of people, the 
eviction of properties and the adoption of additional 
monitoring measures;
(ii)  Signed an agreement and an amendment there-
to with the Public Defender’s Office of the State of 
Alagoas, the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office, the 
Federal Public Defender’s Office, and the Public Pros -
ecutor’s Office of the State of Alagoas to support the 
eviction and compensation of residents in risk areas, 
defined according to their criticality based on techni-
cal criteria of the Civil Defense, through the Financial 
Compensation and Relocation Support Program;
(iii)  Signature of an agreement with the Labor Prosecu-
tion Office for the implementation of the Program for 
Business Recovery and Promotion of Educational Ac -
tivities for residents and workers in these same areas.
See more details in 2019 Sustainability Report on: https:/ /www.braskem.com/RI/annual-reports  In 2019, we recognized, with a provision in the fourth 
quarter result, the total amount of approximately R$ 3.4 
billion related to the implementation of these actions, 
which will be spent over the next few years and may be 
changed due to the development of the topic, including:
(I)  Support in eviction and compensation for residents 
in risk areas: R$ 1.7 billion;
(II) Closure and monitoring of salt wells: R$ 1 billion;
(III)  Other measures not covered by the agreement:  
R$ 700 million.
In July 2020, the Company entered into an amend-
ment to said agreement with the authorities in order 
to include support measures to be adopted for the 
eviction in the new risk areas, according to the Map 
of Damage Sectorization and Priority Action Lines 
updated by the Civil Defense of Maceió, which in-
corporated about 2,000 properties into the agree-
ment signed in January this year. 
Thus, the total amount of the provision for the geo-
logical event in Alagoas was R$ 4.58 billion, of which 
R$ 2.61 billion was recorded in the short term and  
R$ 1.97 billion in the long term.
The Company continues to collaborate with the au-
thorities by hiring specialists and academic institu-
tions in the area of geology and seismology, from 
Brazil and abroad, to identify the causes of the geo-
logical phenomenon.
52Collaborative Actions
In order to better serve the families covered by the Fi-
nancial Compensation and Relocation Support Program, 
the Company set up the ‘Central do Morador’ [‘Resident 
Center’] with a team from Braskem and contracted spe-
cialists that includes: (i) banking service points; (ii) mov-
ing services; (iii) furniture storage; (iv) accommodation 
of pets; (v) psychological support; (vi) space for families 
to meet with their lawyers; (vii) single registration point 
of the Municipal Department for Social Assistance; and 
(viii) a Public Defender’s traveling truck.
Operations
In relation to our operations, they account for 3% of Ala-
goas’ GDP and involve more than 60 companies in the 
plastic and chemical chain in the state. For this reason, 
even with the interruption of important activities, we 
have assumed a commitment with the stakeholders and 
have not dismissed any members.
For more information access:
http:/ /www.braskem.com.br/alagoasIn addition, to honor the service to our Customers, we im-
port raw material from other states and abroad, with a fo-
cus on resuming operations at the Pontal da Barra plant in 
the future. We asked the Brazilian Mining Agency (ANM) for 
authorization to research salt reserves in rural areas of Ala-
goas to continue generating jobs and income in the region. 
On May 9, 2019, according to a material fact disclosed 
to the market, Braskem started the process of closing 
the salt extraction activity and the consequent stop-
page of the chlor-alkali and dichloroethane factories in 
Maceió/AL. In view of this scenario, and aiming to re-
sume the chlor-alkali operation, the Company started 
a project that aims to change the raw material base 
for the chlor-alkali factories through the acquisition of 
domestic and/or imported sea salt from third parties. 
The product will be stored, dissolved in water for brine 
production and then treated and sent for processing. 
The estimated cost for the project is R$ 60 million. The 
forecast for starting the chlor-alkali plant is in 4Q20.

https:/ /www.braskem.com/RI/annual-reportsCustomers 
It is through partnership and development together with 
our Customers that our products are transformed to 
make the lives of millions of people better. By establishing 
long-lasting and deep relationships with our Clients, we 
are able to grow together and boost our entire value chain.
In addition to our dedicated commercial, product engi-
neering and market development teams present in the 
4 countries where we operate, in addition to our com-
mercial offices, we have a specific channel for our Cus -
tomers available at https: /www.braskem.com.br/Cli-
ents on which we made available our product catalogs, 
quotation for these products, progress of purchase or -
ders, invoices, bank-issued invoices, consultations and 
requests for credit limit, and consultation to the quality 
certificate. In line with this commitment, we have un-
dertaken a series of initiatives to strengthen the rela-
tionship with our Customers.
Circular Economy: we have entered into partnerships 
with several customers to develop more sustainable 
products, such as the renewable ones, which expand 
and facilitate the recycling and reuse of plastic pack -
aging. In addition, we developed actions and solutions 
to enhance post-consumer plastic waste and the re-
cycling chain as a way to mitigate environmental and 
social risks. For this, we entered into partnerships with 
Customers, recyclers, cooperatives and companies 
that own consumer brands.
Through our partnership with the Brazilian Association 
of the Plastic Industry (ABIPLAST), we promote initia-
tives that encourage the export of processed products.
This family of products offers eco-efficient resins that 
help reduce energy consumption during the production 
process and the weight of the final product, in addition 
to increasing productivity, which contributes to reduc -
ing production costs and environmental impacts. Plastic transformation movement
With the purpose of contributing to the growth of plas -
tic transformation, we have worked since 2013 in part-
nership with Brazilian Association of the Plastic Industry 
(ABIPLAST) in the development of the Incentive Plan for 
the Plastic Chain (PICPlast). The initiative has two main 
fronts: (i) Competitiveness and Innovation, responsible 
for the training offered to transformation companies 
so that they can improve their products, processes and 
solutions, and (ii) Plastic Transformation Movement, 
which seeks to show the importance of plastic in peo-
ple’s daily lives in various projects. 
Novos modelos de negócio
Our Digital Center also explores new business oppor -
tunities and services for our Clients. Thus, in 2019, we 
started two internal startups that, together, operated 
more than 1,000 transactions.
•  Edge Portal: is a platform for customers in the 
chemical industry. Edge allows customers to con-
duct research and comparisons among available 
products, place orders and access their purchase 
history. They are also able to track shipments and 
access sales documents.
 
•  LoadShark: aims to improve the way the Company 
schedules deliveries by truck from factories to ware-
houses and to customers. In Brazil, about 1500 deliv-
eries leave Braskem’s factories every day. Scheduling 
deliveries is a largely manual process that involves 
different people, papers and spreadsheets. LoadShark 
uses algorithms to assess the impact of orders, truck 
locations, receipts, customers, destinations and deliv-
ery times. Thus, the platform uses this data to create 
the most efficient delivery schedule for freight costs 
and fleet productivity.
54Suppliers 
Our suppliers and service providers are an essential 
part of our production chain and they are fundamental 
to maintaining our ability to generate value for all our 
stakeholders. Aware of this importance and in line with 
our sustainable development strategy, we are commit-
ted to developing and using suppliers and service pro-
viders in the locations where we operate.
Our supplier management is decentralized, with areas 
responsible for analyzing expenses, evaluating the qual-
ity of products and services and adhering to the Code of 
Conduct for Third Parties. The Code is based on widely 
accepted documents such as the United Nations Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights, the procedures 
recommended by the International Labor Organiza-
tion (ILO) and the laws and regulations of the countries 
where we operate. In addition, 100% of contract sup-
pliers for our industrial areas must also respond to and 
meet our minimum HSE requirements.
In 2019, we completed the validation process for the 
Sustainable Procurement Tool, which improves the 
process of assessing socio-environmental risks during 
the technical analysis of bids, helping different pro-
curement teams to insert sustainability issues in the 
selection of Suppliers. % OF NATIONAL SUPPLIERS 2019 (A) 2018 (B) A-B

USA 97% 96% -1.0 p.p.
Germany 97% 98% 1.0 p.p.
Mexico 49% 71% 22.0 p.p.
In 2019, the Supply area was once 
again recognized by the CDP Supply 
Chain program, which highlights the 
companies that most encourage 
their Suppliers to join their business 
in terms of sustainability, such as 
reporting greenhouse gas emissions 
and water management.
In addition to teams dedicated to relationship with sup-
pliers in all countries where we operate, we also have a 
Supplier Portal available at https:/www.braskem.com.
br/fornecedores, where Suppliers have access to news 
about our company, results of their evaluations, sales 
information, among other features.
55Diversification
The diversification of suppliers is also part of our strategy so that the Company has the ability to guarantee the supply 
of feedstock in different circumstances.
Reduction of the reliance on brazilian naphtha 
In Brazil, the supplier of our plants is mainly Petro-
bras. However, since 2010, we have sought to in-
crease the reliability of naphtha supply by diversi-
fying suppliers and expanding imports. Accordingly, 
we increased the share of imported naphtha by 29 
percentage points of the total purchased naphtha, 
which mitigates the risk of dependence on a single 
supplier for our Brazilian operations.
Diversification
In the United States, we have propylene suppliers of 
various types, such as refineries, first generation pet-
rochemicals (crackers) and propane dehydrogenators. 
There are more than 15 suppliers in that region. In Europe, 
we have more than 5 propylene suppliers in Germany.Fast-track for ethane import
In Mexico, our main supplier is Pemex, contractually 
responsible for at least 70% of the supply of ethane - 
the raw material of our petrochemical plant. Thus, in 
line with the supplier diversification strategy, we in-
vested approximately US$ 2.4 million in a short-term 
solution for importing ethane from the United States, 
with logistics through trucks. This solution has been 
in operation since December 2019 and aims to supply 
12,800 barrels per day to 25,400 barrels per day, which 
represents a supply between 19% and 38% of this 
plant’s ethane requirement.
Government 
In order to exercise their activities, our Members and 
third parties acting on our behalf need to interact with 
Public Agents. We believe that any interaction with Pub-
lic Agents must be based on ethics, transparency and a 
legitimate dialogue: (i) originated by a lawful and ethical 
reason that is in accordance with our policies; (ii) car -
ried out with Public Agents who have functional com-
petence to conduct the dialogue; and (iii) conducted in 
an appropriate manner, with standard language, appro-
priate style and vocabulary and professional treatment.
To conduct this legitimate dialogue with the Govern-
ment, in addition to the institutional relations team, we 
also have a government relations team and the Public 
Agent Interaction Tool, so that our Members can record 
all information about any type of interaction.
In our relationship with the Government, we have tax 
and fiscal obligations, tax incentives, special tax re-
gimes, contingent liabilities, the Global Agreement and 
financing with government agencies and public banks.2010 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019

56Contingencies
As a result of the normal course of our activities, we 
may be a defendant in legal and administrative pro-
ceedings of a civil, corporate, fiscal-tax, labor and 
regulatory nature. Based on the opinion of our exter -
nal legal advisors, we classify these proceedings as 
probable loss, in which the likelihood of loss is greater 
than 50%, and possible loss, in which the likelihood 
of loss is between 25% and 50%. For lawsuits with a 
probable loss, we maintain an accounting provision 
in the amount corresponding to: (i) amount in con-
troversy, plus due charges, for tax and social security 
processes; and (ii) estimated disbursement amount, 
plus due charges, for labor and other claims. We do 
not maintain a provision for processes with possible 
loss, except for those arising from business combina-
tions, since the elements available are not sufficient or clear in such a way to allow us to conclude that the 
trend will be of loss or gain.
Alagoas
In view of the situation in Alagoas, we have registered 
civil contingencies within the scope of the Public Civil 
Action against Braskem and other defendants in which 
an award of approximately US$ 7 billion is being sought, 
relating to socio-environmental and property damage, 
in addition to several other remedial measures, including 
environmental compliance, safety plans and suspension 
of the Company’s government benefits.
The Company’s Management, supported by the 
opinion of external legal advisors, classifies the 
chances of loss as possible.

57Global Agreement
In the context of the unlawful acts performed by for -
mer Members and agents within the scope of Operation 
Car Wash (Operação Lava Jato) in Brazil, in December 
2016 we entered into a Global Agreement with the US 
Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), in the United States, with 
the Attorney General’s Office, in Switzerland, and with 
the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office (MPF), in Brazil. 
Under the terms of the Global Agreement, the Company 
agreed to pay the authorities of such jurisdictions the to-
tal amount of US$ 957 million (equivalent to R$ 3.1 billion). 
In May 2019, we entered into an Agreement with the Of -
fice of the Federal Controller General (CGU) and the Of -
fice of the General Counsel for the Federal Government

⁴ Balance will be paid in two annual installments in 2024 and 2025
Financing with public agencies
To finance our growth and strategic projects, we have 
contracted loans from public banks and government 
agencies in Brazil such as the Brazilian Bank for Econom-
ic and Social Development (BNDES) and Banco do Nor -
deste do Brasil. Abroad, we have operations with Credit 
and Export Agencies (ECAs), such as Nippon Export and 
Investment Insurance (NEXI), from Japan, Euler Hermes, 
from Germany, and SACE, from Italy. The relationship 
with these banks and government agencies is conducted 
by the Project and Investment Financing area.(AGU), in Brazil (AGU/CGU Agreement), on the same 
facts as the subject matter of the Global Agreement, 
resulting in an approximate additional disbursement of 
R$ 410 million.
Under this agreement, Braskem was also subject to 
monitoring required by the Brazilian Federal Pub-
lic Prosecutor’s Office, the US Department of Justice 
(DOJ) and the US Securities and Exchange Commis -
sion (SEC), in order to assess the company’s compliance 
practices and implement improvements. In the first 
quarter of 2020, monitoring was completed and our 
compliance system was certified by the three agents 
involved. Learn more in the Compliance Chapter.
58Risk Rating Agency
Our commitment to generating value today and in the future depends on maintaining our financial strength. We 
have a credit risk rating by the three largest agencies: Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s. 
In 2020, due to the uncertainties caused by the pandemic scenario of COVID-19, Braskem had its credit risk reas -
sessed, which led to a downgrade in both Fitch (BB+) and S&P (BB+), matching our credit risk with the credit risk of 
the Brazilian government by the two agencies. The relationship with the rating agencies is conducted by the Inves -
tor Relations area and we make available to the market most of the reports issued by the agencies about our credit 
profile at https:/ /www.braskem.com/RI/Ratings.
Shareholders
We conduct our business with ethics, transparen-
cy and integrity to ensure the best return for share-
holders, adding value to their equity and remunerating 
their invested capital.
With 6 Members, our Investor Relations area works daily 
to keep the communication channel open between our 
managers and shareholders in order to reduce the per -
ceived value of our company by the market and its effec -
tively fair value. To this end, we provide information that 
goes beyond the minimum required by regulatory agen-
cies of the capital market and, therefore, we promote 
spontaneous, frank, accurate and rapid communication.
Stock performance
Braskem’s class “A” preferred shares (BRKM5) depreciated 
35.2% compared to the end of 2018, quoted at R$ 29.85 per 
share. The devaluation of Braskem’s shares in the year was 
mainly influenced by the downturn in the petrochemical 
cycle and by the end of negotiations between Odebrecht 
and LyondellBasell for the sale of the stake in Braskem ac -
cording to the Material Fact released on June 4.
In 2019, ADRs representing class “A” preferred shares 
depreciated 39.17% in relation to year 2019.Dividend distribution
Our dividend distribution occurs after the assessment 
and approval by our governance bodies as established in 
the policy, which mainly take into account our ability to 
generate cash flow and long-term projections, including 
investment plans and other relevant factors, such as ob-
taining and/or maintaining the investment grade defined 
by the rating agencies. In all cases, our dividend distribu-
tion takes place with total transparency and respect for 
the law, the regulation of the securities market and our 
Financial and Dividend Policies, which determine that 
the proposal for dividends in addition to the minimum 
required by the applicable rules cannot raise Braskem’s 
leverage (Net Debt/EBITDA ratio), in the current year 
and in the subsequent 2 years, more than 2.5 times.Rating

were halted. In addition to that, we had a 
scheduled shutdown in one of the pro-
duction sites in our petrochemical com-
plex in Camaçari/BA and we reduced the 
utilization of our crackers’ capacities in 
general given the lower profitability of 
exports. Thus, the utilization rate of our 
crackers stood at 89% in 2019, a reduc -
tion of 2 percentage points compared

our chlor-alkali sites at Bahia, presenting 
a reduction in our production capacity of 
79 thousand tons of caustic soda and 64

Total of US$ 700 million, US$ 187 million, or 21% less than 
the amount estimated at the beginning of the year, and 
exceeding the US$ 100 million reduction target set at 
the end of the first half of 2019, as a result of our com-
mitment to financial strength in a petrochemical sce-
nario more challenging than what was anticipated.
US$ 470 million in operational projects: the largest in-
vestments were made at the scheduled shutdowns at 
the Bahia petrochemical complex, in Brazil, and at the 
La Porte plant, in the United States.
US$ 229 in strategic projects: the resources were di-
rected to the following projects: (i) construction of the 
new PP plant in the United States, which totaled R$ 678 
million (US$ 173 million), representing 75.1% of the total 
invested in strategic projects; (ii) upgrade of electrical in-
frastructure at the Neal plant, in the United States; (iii) 
modernization of the electrical system at the ABC pet-
rochemical complex; and (iv) resumption of chlor-alkali 
production in Maceió, through the acquisition of sea salt.
In 2020, 100% of the construction of the new PP plant 
was completed, which added another 450 thousand 
tons to Braskem’s production capacity. The con-struction of Delta was based on Braskem’s sustain-
able development assumptions, observing relevant 
eco-indicators, such as carbon emissions, water and 
energy efficiency, recycling and reduction of the 
waste volume. Delta’s commercial operation should 
start in 2020 and its production will strengthen the 
supply of domestic US demand, which currently im-
ports polypropylene to fill the deficit in its domestic 
market. The unit will also directly assist Braskem’s 
global export capacity for its customers in North 
America, South America, Europe and Asia.
Value Chain
The products we manufacture are transformed by our 
Clients into manufactured capital in various industries 
such as: automotive, civil construction, durable and 
non-durable consumer goods, agribusiness, hygiene, 
and pharmaceutical, among others.
In 2019, we launched 21 new products that are increas -
ingly sustainable and make people’s lives better:

61The main source of our financial capital is the cash 
generated by our operations - our equity - and 
third-party resources from financial institutions and 
the capital market.
The main applications of financial capital are in fixed 
assets - such as investments in subsidiaries, plants, 
equipment, warehouses, patents, use rights and intan-
gible rights; stocks of raw material and finished prod-
ucts and, finally, the Company’s cash.
Thus, in each fiscal year, we finance business through 
debt and equity, which together with the existing cash 
resources, added to the new funding and the cash gen-
erated by our operations, are applied in our business, and 
result in value added or distributed to all stakeholders.
Third-party resources
In 2019, the Company’s total indebtedness1 increased, 
due to the raising of:
•  US$ 2,250 million via bond issuance in the internation-
al capital market;
•  R$ 500 million of commercial promissory notes issued 
in the Brazilian capital market;
•  US$ 150 million in a credit facility with SACE, the Italian 
export credit agency;
•  Approximately R$ 270 million in a financing line with 
the BNDES, through transfers; FINANCIAL CAPITAL

The proceeds of new issuances were used in part to 
prepay short-term debts, in order to extend the Com-
pany’s debt amortization schedule.
Thus, at the end of 2019, we prepaid debts that would 
mature in the short term. Among the debts prepaid, the

14 years to 17 years, as well as the months of coverage 
of debt maturities by our cash from 40 months to 71 
months at the end of 2019 - this work reinforces our 
commitment with the Company’s financial strength, 
which brings comfort to our cash in the coming periods.We also had an improvement in the cost conditions 
of these new fundings, which resulted in a reduc -

63Free Cash Generation
Free cash generation in 2019 was US$ 771 million, due to 
the lower EBITDA and the payment of interest related 
to the full/partial prepayment of certain bonds (break -
fund costs), with these factors partially offset by: 
•  Decrease in accounts receivable, due to the lower sales 
volume and lower sales prices of products; 
•  Lower inventories of feedstock and finished goods; 
•  higher volume of naphtha imports with longer pay-
ment terms; 
Distributed value
We aim to distribute our financial capital in order to add value to all our stakeholders. Thus, any resource provided, 
whether by third parties or by the company’s cash, is applied and returns with added value for the entire society.CASH GENERATION

64OUTLOOK FOR 
THE FUTURE AND 
STRATEGY
At Braskem, we carry out in-depth assessments of the 
external and internal context in which we operate be-
fore defining our strategic actions. In the external con-
text, megatrends have the potential to create signifi-
cant implications and changes for the petrochemical 
industry. In this sense, Braskem is committed to par -
ticipating in the debate and understanding how mega-
trends are transforming the economic and commercial 
scenario, in addition to the implications for our custom-
ers, for us and for society.
Still in the external context, it is essential to understand 
the current and future panorama of the global petro-
chemical scenario. The fundamentals of the industry 
pose important challenges for petrochemical compa-
nies and must be constantly evaluated. Finally, in the 
internal context, we analyze aspects such as: internal 
competences and tangible or intangible assets that the 
company controls. Being the world leader in 
sustainable chemistry
MEGATRENDS
Currently, humanity is experiencing a unique and special 
moment in its history, in which factors of great impact 
on the environment, people, society and the economy 
are interacting in an accelerated way to create a future 
that is totally different from the past. 
At Braskem, we work together with several stakeholders 
to understand the major changes that are challenging or -
ganizations. These major changes are classified as meg-
atrends and can represent great opportunities or risks for 
the way companies interact with their customers.
Among all the global megatrends, we are committed to 
accompanying those that have the greatest disruptive 
potential in our industry in order to transform them into 
new opportunities for differentiation.
65Industry 4.0
The trend is related to the evolution of the connectivity among machines and digital technologies, 
which are integrated to human activities, by using data collection, typo storage and analyzing it quickly.
Our response to that trend, we have been working expand initiatives from the Digital Center, which the 
role is to promote digital transformation in our industrial and corporate process.
Circular Economy
This trend is a response to the linear economy, the economic model based on the linear production 
method: extract, produce and dispose of as waste, which is reaching its limit, considering its neg-
ative impacts to the environment. The circular economy, aims to keep resources in use for as long 
as possible, extracting the maximum value throughout their use, to then recover and regenerate 
products and materials at the end of each life cycle.
In response to that trend, we have positioned in 2018 in favor of the Circular Economy, an-
nouncing several initiatives, such as the development of chemical and mechanical recycling. 
Renewable Energy
Since the world is under constantly development, we have observing an increase of the energy ne-
cessity and, considering the negative impact of energy consumption from fossil fuels, the trend is 
that renewable energy will be even more produced and consumed, so the environmental impacts 
can be lower than that generated by the fossil fuel consumption. 
In response to that trend, we seek for diversify our energy matrix and energy efficiency of our op-
eration, thru power purchase agreements and partnerships for renewable energy consumption.
3D printing
The trend to increase adoption of products made from 3D printing, which reproduces physically an 
ideia developed digitally.
In response to that trend, we search for the development of products that can be used as raw 
material for 3D printing production.
Mobility Revolution
The trend for replace traditional vehicles to electric ones, that has been expanded in different coun-
tries, such as China, European Union and United States, mainly by the formulation of new regulations.
In response to that, we have been monitoring this trend and searching for the market develop-
ment, which can use plastics to make vehicles lighter and more efficient.

66GLOBAL 
PETROCHEMICAL 
LANDSCAPE
Despite the disruptive potential of megatrends in 
the petrochemical industry, investment decisions 
in the sector continue to be driven by expectations 
about the competitiveness and accessibility of raw 
materials and global economic growth, since the de-
mand for chemicals is highly correlated to the world 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this sense, the 
most consolidated and important risks for produc -
ers in the sector are still the imbalances between 
supply and demand for chemical products and vola-
tility in the prices of raw materials, which follow dif -
ferent dynamics and are commonly defined by other 
uses, such as for fuel and energy.
From the end of 2019 to the present, the world econo-
my has been impacted by the drop in demand caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2020, the IMF’s initial 
expectation was that the world economy would show 
a modest improvement. However, the spread of the 
coronavirus (COVID-19) changed this scenario for a 
significant drop in world GDP . In the short term, the 
recovery is expected to be gradual, with global growth 
projected for 2021 below what was expected in the 
pre-pandemic projections, but influenced mainly by 
China’s growth. 
Despite the gradual recovery of economies, this sce-
nario has led major players in the global petrochemi-
cal industry to postpone investment decisions in new 
capacities, as well as the start of new ethylene plants, 
mainly in the United States. Thus, in the short term, 
China and North America are expected to lead the 
addition of new ethylene production capacity. In the 
medium and long term, the new additions will still be 
concentrated in China, but also in other countries in 
Asia and the Middle East. 
According to data from an external consultancy spe-
cialized in the petrochemical sector, approximate-
ly 46.1 million tons of annual ethylene capacity are 
scheduled to be commissioned between 2020 and 
2024 worldwide. In China alone, it is expected that 
approximately 22.3 million tons will be commissioned. In North America, mainly in the United States, the 
forecast is that 9.9 million tons of ethylene capacity 
will start operating, with ethane as the main raw ma-
terial due to the great competitiveness of this prod-
uct in the cost curve. It is important to note that due 
to the intensity of capital required for construction of 
the plants and the complexity of the projects, these 
are often subject to delays and/or cancellations.
In relation to the price dynamics of the main raw ma-
terials, the beginning of 2020 was marked by the fall 
in the price of oil, due to the price reduction and pro-
duction increase announced by Saudi Arabia, after 
Russia’s opposition to limit world production in nego-
tiations with the Organization of the Petroleum Ex -
porting Countries (OPEC) - the negotiations took into 
account the drop in global demand due to COVID. 
After intermediation by the United States, Russia, 
Saudi Arabia and OPEC agreed on a historic 10% cut 
in production. Thus, the current scenario is a recov-
ery in oil prices, but still below the prices practiced in 
2019, which reflects in the price of naphtha, one of 
our main raw materials. 
OUR VALUE  
GENERATION STRATEGY
Once the external context (megatrends and the pet-
rochemical scenario) has been analyzed, we will begin 
to analyze our internal context. In the internal analy-
sis, relevant aspects for a petrochemical company are 
evaluated, such as production scale, global presence, 
raw material matrix, economic and financial metrics, 
and competency gaps, among others. 
Based on the process of analyzing the external and 
internal context, we define our strategy with the in-
tention of ensuring the construction of an increasingly 
competitive company, with a focus on operational ex -
cellence and resilience with respect to volatility. 
67Our strategy is focused on 5 pillars and their respective ambitions. Additionally, safe action is and will always be a focus on Braskem’s 
operations, being a perpetual and non-negotiable value in our strategy.
