CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016PGS strives to be a dedicated, reliable 
pioneer within its industry, and these 
are the values that we encourage 
our employees around the globe to embrace in all aspects of our business. As a company we strive 
to live up to our responsibilities, 
improve our performance and set 
goals and objectives that inspire us to innovate and 
deliver on our promises. We rely on our employees to 
do the same and support them in their endeavors. 
This report provides an overview of actions taken towards 
these goals. Underlying this is the drive to remain efficient and effective. Our industry is highly competitive. Recent years have been demanding for the oil industry and the oil services segment in particular. We have learned to scrutinize every penny spent, and use our resources wisely while carrying our responsibilities towards our people employed and the stakeholders around us. 
PGS has become leaner. Over the past couple of years 
we have reduced headcount and sharpened our focus on the most important objectives and requirements. Our commitment to safety remains firm and our vision that  all incidents can be avoided is unchanged. Strategically  and operationally, PGS has strengthened its relative position to peers while keeping its integrity intact.
As always, I am interested to hear your views on how we 
can improve our performance on responsibility.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016The ten principles of the UN Global Compact, 
together with the recommendations of the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) form the foundation 
of PGS’ corporate responsibility reporting. They provide us with a definition for responsible business as well as a code that guides the 
implementation of our reporting process.
Corporate responsibility is good for business. It challenges 
us to question how we interact with each other and our stakeholders, creating opportunities for improvement.In 2016, we revised our materiality analysis to identify the issues that are most relevant to PGS and its stakeholders. All corporate responsibility areas are important, but the analysis identified the following subjects as having a critical impact to PGS whilst being highly significant to stakeholders: 
Ensuring legal compliance and avoiding corruption
Protecting health, safety and security of our people 
Employee development
Managing impacts on the environment
Customer satisfaction
We continuously direct our efforts towards advancing these areas and aligning them with broader societal goals. Introduction

Adjusting to Market Challenges
Following a year of downsizing, 2016 was another challenging year for PGS. Continued focus on cost-reductions, including reductions in both onshore and offshore organizations, were made to adjust to current and anticipated supply and demand. Lower demand created lower volumes, excess capacity and lower prices. 
Many of the challenges centered on how to build and improve 
processes in a smaller organization. There were also initiatives to sustain the company during the downturn and to prepare for the upturn, such as:
Standardizing processes and eliminating those that do not create value. This initiative included improving the sharing of best practices across the fleet. 
Improving understanding of company decisions within our offshore organization. This was achieved by frequent and detailed communication from management, through regular face-to-face meetings to update our crew on the market, our operational goals, and by making management available for feedback.Reviewing organizational efficiency offshore and onshore. This resulted in the creation of a single unit for onboard geophysics combining two departments which previously reported to different business areas.
While the organization worked to implement these initiatives we emphasized that we would not accept compromises on safety. Maintaining good communication across the organization, especially between onshore and offshore, is important to both our safety and our success. Read more about HSEQ activities in the next section of this report.
These initiatives sustain us during the downturn and, together 
with regular communication to all employees, help position our organization to take advantage of the market upturn when it comes.People

PGS Career Framework
Early in 2016 PGS finalized a fully functional career framework for all employees in our management and technical career tracks. 
By defining a hierarchical structure and mapping how 
positions are related to each other, we have constructed a career framework that will make it easier to see what qualifications and competencies are required to advance between roles. 
In the second half of 2016 this system was implemented 
within our Imaging & Engineering business unit in an initial rollout covering around two thirds of all positions. Other business units have also begun implementing the system.
The PGS Career Framework will allow employees to take 
more ownership of their career development. It will also serve as a basis for identifying development needs and better targeted development activities.
Leading Others Program  
Management training has been a major initiative in 2016. With the “Leading Others Program” PGS sets a global corporate standard for good people management. 
Following an analysis of first-line managers’ needs by 
department managers, we derived a training concept to benefit the entire organization. The program lasts for approximately 6 months, with several training modules. Content is closely linked to the everyday work of a first- line manager, and the exercises are tied into real-life  PGS situations.
In 2016 we ran three programs in three different PGS office 
locations and around 60 line-managers participated. 
The “Leading Others Program” has been well received. 
Participant evaluation implies that the content of the program is useful and relevant, and that it develops the necessary competence and motivation for change. A high percentage replied positively to the question “I will change the way I work based on what I have learnt. ”
Looking Ahead 
This year we will carry out our periodic PeopleSurvey, and continue rolling out the PGS career framework to other business areas. We look forward to harvesting the benefits of the first-line leadership training.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016HSEQ
Key Activities — HSEQ
Implementation of Key Safety Risks 
Last year we introduced the concept of Key Safety Risks. Mitigating risk to our people is a key element of our HSEQ efforts and the Key Safety Risks reinforce this message  by focusing on employee risk-awareness and behavior.
Key Safety Risks describe our most significant risks, 
specifically defined for PGS, and how these are addressed  
by Key Safety Controls. Addressing and countering the specific risks, associated with our work is central to  
our collective responsibility to ensure the safety of  
our colleagues and ourselves.
The Key Safety Risks have now been implemented 
throughout PGS with presentations in offshore safety meetings on all vessels, and office HSEQ awareness sessions. In addition we have facilitated department  level workshops, with focus on how the specific risks  and controls apply to each person, position and role.Key Safety Risks, and how to manage them,  are summarized in six targeted areas:
Hazardous activities
Slips, trips and falls
Tools and manual handling 
Journey management
Drugs and alcohol 
Building and vessel safety 
Seven key controls are identified to mitigate these  and all other operational risks:
Follow HSEQ procedures
Conduct risk assessment 
Stop unsafe acts and intervene
Manage contractors 
Manage change 
Ensure good housekeeping
Permit to work

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016Competence in Emergency Response 
Professional crisis management can save lives during an emergency. It also enables us to take better care of the environment and our assets, and maintain our professional reputation.
The PGS response to a crisis situation is organized in three 
levels of responsibility, as described in the illustration above. Tactical 1st Line, Operational 2nd Line and Strategic 3rd Line have particular responsibilities for managing an emergency situation. Emergency response teams are established on all three levels.
To be capable of handling an emergency situation, an 
acceptable level of competence is required. An emergency response training plan is prepared and executed every  
year, which requires all PGS emergency response teams  to meet and train regularly. It is often said that practice makes perfect, and we regard this as vital for our teams  to perform well.
A competent leader will also improve team performance 
during a crisis. In 2016 we offered tailored training to our emergency response team leaders: 27 leaders completed the training on five courses held at various locations. The training was run by the PGS HSEQ Security Management & Emergency Response Group and feedback from participants was very positive.
Integrated Risk Management 
Reducing total risk exposure is a key long-term objective and an area of continuous improvement for our HSEQ performance. During 2016, we continued to integrate risk-thinking in everything we do. It is our offshore operations that face the greatest risks. PGS operational planning and decision-making are therefore based on risk-thinking, ensuring project risk assessments always link project risks to daily operational risks. In addition to embedding risk-thinking throughout Operations, we dedicated resources to improving the quality of our vessel risk profiles, and implemented a revised set of dynamic Job Safety Analysis (JSA) tools  
to ensure we capture best practices for all safety-critical jobs onboard our vessels.  JSA is an integral component  of our risk management process and a fundamental tool  for planning safe operations.
Risk Verification
In 2017 , we will further optimize our approach to risk by strengthening the quality of our risk management system, and verifying compliance for the most critical activities. We will continue assessing the effectiveness of our JSA and Project Risk Assessment systems and work towards implementation of a common PGS approach to risk.
Results from Certification Audits 
In 2011, PGS achieved the OHSAS 18001 certification and in 2012 – the ISO 14001. From the beginning, these certifications have helped guide our development of the integrated HSEQ management system that drives our industry-leading HSEQ performance. Certification pins our performance to a recognized international standard and helps us develop our environmental management system work towards minimizing our impact on the environment. 
In 2016, similarly to past years, the certifying body DNVGL 
audited our management system to assess compliance with regard to certifications. The main area of scrutiny in this year’s audit was the effectiveness of internal reporting. We achieved great results, with no non-conformities or observations. This is a good indication that despite the challenging times, we continue to focus on and achieve high-standards in HSEQ activities.HSEQ

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016HSEQ Strategy 2017-2021
In 2016, we re-defined our HSEQ strategy to make it clearer, consistent and easier to understand. The 2017-2021 HSEQ strategy defines our vision. The innermost circle of the graph above outlines our long-term objectives. They are supported by a detailed set of road-map programs and initiatives.  
In 2017 , we will start the company-wide implementation 
of the revised HSEQ strategy. Presentations will focus on describing how our strategy is linked to the day-to-day activities of each employee and seek to explain how the HSEQ management system operates. The goal is to raise general HSEQ awareness.  
Engaging a Global Medical Advisor 
Employee health is important to our company, and a strategic decision was taken in 2016 to strengthen our medical expertise. PGS entered into a cooperation with International SOS. The agreement covers medical and security assistance, information, forecasting and support. It also covers evacuation and repatriation services, and a medical examination program. In addition to enhanced medical and security programs, PGS has engaged a global medical advisor. 
The global medical advisor provides advice during survey 
planning, which includes reviewing and approving medical facilities in onshore locations adjacent to planned offshore operations. He is involved in all cases were injured and ill persons are required to leave PGS vessels for medical reasons. He follows up on treatment and fitness to work, and supports our Offshore HR team as required.Our health management system is benefiting from a review of existing manuals and procedures. Finally, with his advice, we are implementing a program that ensures consistency in offshore medicals.
Environmental Initiatives
Avoiding energy waste is a significant element in our support of the United Nations convention to combat climate change. This is an issue that is important to PGS stakeholders. Efficient use of energy was a key objective for PGS in 2016, and our Operations teams implemented a number of improvements related to survey and voyage planning, as well as fuel management. These resulted in material reductions in our fleet emissions, while also reducing costs.
We remain dedicated to protection of the marine 
environment, and compliance with applicable regulations is an area of constant focus. In recent years PGS has worked hard to ensure all risks to the environment are fully understood. Through significantly improved survey planning and execution, we aim to manage these risks with the same professionalism and commitment with which we address other risks inherent in our operations. Our objective is to minimize impact on marine life, and cooperate with other users of the oceans. In 2017 , we will focus on further improving operational environmental monitoring and mitigation by developing a long-term strategy to employ  
the best available technology on our surveys.
Looking Ahead 
Reliability and risk management will continue to be our theme in 2017 , with new initiatives in the year ahead targeting health and safety, environmental planning,  
and emergency response.HSEQ

Improved Prevention and Monitoring 
A big part of our anti-corruption efforts has been about raising awareness to help employees recognize risks and understand the portfolio of tools we have available to help them make the right decisions when a tricky situation occurs. In 2016, we achieved our highest rate ever for anti-corruption training. We identified a group of people, representing approximately 20% of our total work force, that are particularly exposed to corruption risk. All of them were trained in personal face-to-face courses consisting of tailored dilemma plots covering different scenarios. The courses were delivered by compliance specialists, line managers and legal personnel. In addition, all employees, onshore and offshore, completed several E-learning modules on anti-corruption and compliance. 
Compliance monitoring was also further improved, as 
was the consequent reporting frequency to the Board and Executive Management. Primary areas for monitoring include registration of gifts and entertainment, high risk payments to agents and others, local content support, and concerns raised through our compliance hotline. Principle decisions related to our anti-corruption program are made by our Compliance & Ethics Board
Intensified Monitoring of 3rd Parties
To manage our supply chain, we have clear due diligence procedures to assess corruption risk for all potential new suppliers with relevant exposure. This includes interviews, questionnaires, vigorous background and reference checks, and final sign off by an Executive Vice President before business can commence. These procedures have been tightened recently to mitigate corruption risk. All PGS agents have been assessed and a thorough re-qualification is ongoing. Agreements and certificates have been renewed where appropriate, and documentation is now significantly more comprehensive. 
Human rights and contractors
PGS has a well-established Human Rights policy, which is 
known and implemented throughout the company. The 
requirements in this policy are also valid for our contractors, and going forward we will further increase our focus on monitoring the human rights aspects for contractors. Core Values TrainingWe’ve developed a set of training materials to help our employees understand our revised Core Values. The training is aimed at providing guidelines for how to use the core values when interacting with colleagues, clients, and others we encounter in our day-to-day work. In 2016, we rolled out a specific Core Values training onboard our vessels for seismic and maritime crew which was attended by over 80% of crew during the year.

Contractor Relationships Through  
Performance ScorecardsProfessional relationships with our strategic partners continue to strengthen. We secure this by sharing our goals and objectives with key suppliers, as well as monitoring and giving feedback on selected key performance indicators.
A tailored supplier relationship management program 
ensures transparency regarding our longer-term requirements for capacity, quality and new technology.  
This is a risk mitigation factor for supplier-related risks.
Strategic Customer Relationships 
Our customers’ success is paramount to our success. This is a long-term relationship and it must be nurtured. Understanding the priorities and requirements of each customer can offer critical competitive advantages. To ensure PGS can best serve its customers' needs, our executive management team drives and supports a coordinated customer relations program. The Customer Strategic Relations team is responsible for managing various initiatives supported by tools and procedures to enable a consistent global approach. Key customers are assigned a dedicated resource within PGS who manages and develops all aspects of mutual interaction to maximize the business relationship. Within our MultiClient business, the Global Key Account Initiative also aims to cultivate long-term relationships with customers. Global key account networks link regional key account managers, creating teams that are able to evolve a deeper understanding of customers’ challenges, exploration drivers and strategy. This enables richer communication and closer dialog, improving our ability to deliver PGS’ value proposition.
By better maching customers' challenges with PGS 
strengths we can focus on where these meet, in order to provide solutions that offer long-term value, thereby ensuring mutual success.
PGS Support for Industry Foundation
PGS sponsorships prioritize education, relationships with local communities and ocean preservation. Our support of the SEG Foundation is a good example. Despite the challenging market, PGS continues to support the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) as it offers value not only to us, but to our entire industry. The SEG Foundation is a ‘not-for-profit’ organization that provides management, reporting, and stewardship services to inspire the geoscientists of tomorrow. The organization is widely supported by the geophysical industry. In 2008 PGS began sponsoring a SEG initative called, Advancing Geophysics Today, Inspiring Geoscientists for Tomorrow. This program aims to develop a comprehensive internet resource of geophysical knowledge and education.
In 2012, we signed up for a four year sponsorship of the 
Geoscientists Without Borders® program, registered by the SEG foundation. This initiative supports humanitarian applications of geoscience around the world and provides funding to projects that benefit communities in need.Stakeholders
Looking Ahead 
Going forward PGS will continue to reach out to its  stakeholders. We would like them to see us as a reliable and trusted partner. We will continue to monitor the performance of our contractors and review our requirements.2 930
