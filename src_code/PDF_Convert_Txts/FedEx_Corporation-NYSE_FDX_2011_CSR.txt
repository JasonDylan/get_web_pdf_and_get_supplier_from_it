IN RESPONSIBLE AND RESOURCEFUL WAYS 
By increasing access to the marketplace and innovation, FedEx promotes 
business opportunities that facilitate trade and economic growth. And in the 
process, we meet the needs of consumers the world over.
The goods we deliver across our networks move the global economy—from 
corporations that span the world to startups that want to compete in a new  
market. In fact, the largest economy in the world is no longer the economy  
of any one country, it’s the economy of global trade and services. 
Economics and Access is one of four specific areas where FedEx documents 
progress each year in our Global Citizenship Report. Along with Environment 
and Efficiency, Community and Disaster Relief, and People and Workplace, 
we offer data, information, and examples in our report of how we live up to 
our responsibilities. FedEx team members contribute to our progress in these 
four important areas, their actions speaking just as loudly as the numbers 
that mark our progress.
The more people, communities, businesses, and nations participate in the 
global economy, the more they prosper. Poverty rates drop, new markets 
emerge, and the global middle class expands.
In developing nations such as Brazil, China, and India, standards of living are 
rising, and the global middle class is growing fast—from 1.8 billion in 2010  
to an estimated 5 billion by 2030, according to The Brookings Institution.1 The 
opportunity to move up always comes when people have more connections to  
the global marketplace. It’s our job at FedEx to help create those connections  
and make them easier and faster to use. 
As people interact with others around the world, their diverse skills and 
perspectives mix, creating new opportunities—and greater prosperity. We 
know that the amazing diversity of our more than 300,000 team members 
improves our own business. And we believe that by opening the global 
marketplace to everyone, we help bring prosperity. 
The power of the global economy to cut poverty is clear. In 1981, 52 percent of 
the world’s population lived on less than $1.25 a day. This percentage is 
expected to fall to 15 percent by 2015, according to the World Bank.2Economics & Access
GLOBAL OPPORTUNITY
At FedEx, we believe promoting Access makes smart business sense not only 
for our shareholders but also for the communities and businesses we serve. 
We see the most dramatic changes in the multitude of small businesses going 
global from day one, like the recent meteoric growth of Cambridge Satchel. 
A U.K. mom who wanted to earn the money to send her daughter to a better 
school founded the company. She thought she could earn the money making 
new versions of classic British book satchels. Cambridge Satchel now employs 
more than 60 staff and has a pipeline of more than 30,000 orders for satchels 
headed to consumers in more than 140 countries.

FEDEX OPERATING COMPANIES
FedEx Corporation provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, 
and business services through companies competing collectively, operating 
independently, and managed collaboratively under the respected FedEx brand.  
These companies are included in four business segments:
FedEx Express:  Federal Express Corporation is the world’s largest express 
transportation company, offering time-definite delivery within 1 to 3 business 
days and serving markets that comprise more than 90 percent of the world’s 
gross domestic product. The FedEx Express segment also includes FedEx 
Trade Networks, Inc., which provides international trade services, specializing 
in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding, and FedEx 
SupplyChain Systems, Inc., which offers a range of supply chain solutions.
FedEx Ground:  FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. is a leading North American 
provider of small package ground delivery services. FedEx Ground provides 
low-cost, day-definite service to every business address in the United States

sales, marketing, information technology, communications, and back-office 
support. The FedEx Services segment also includes FedEx TechConnect, Inc., 
which is responsible for customer service, billings, and collections for our 
U.S. customers and offers technical support services, and FedEx Office and 
Print Services, Inc., which provides an array of document and business services 
and retail access to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services.
SUSTAINABLE ACCESS AND TRADE
We are committed to introducing new solutions that improve the efficiency  
and footprint of the Access we provide. In addition to environmental 
sustainability efforts that address our fleet, our facilities, and our workplaces 
(see csr.fedex.com ), we continue to promote the idea of sustainable trade 
lanes. Here are a few examples:
Our 777Fs can fly farther on less fuel while carrying more cargo than the 
MD-11s they replace. In fact, our 777Fs use 18 percent less fuel than the MD-11 
aircraft and provide greater payload capacity. The result? A steep reduction  
in cost and emissions per unit transported. 
We recently added seven more 777Fs, increasing our fleet to 19. Based on 
current commitments, we plan to have 43 777Fs in service by 2023.
FedEx Express launched one of these 777Fs for a U.S. to South Korea nonstop 
flight, providing service from the Memphis World Hub to Incheon International 
Airport, Seoul, South Korea. The new FedEx Express flight delivers documents 
and packages from the U.S., Canada, and select markets in Latin America to 
Seoul in 2 to 3 business days. The 777F gives FedEx a unique competitive 
advantage and is a growth driver for the business.
This is especially valuable since implementation of the U.S.-South Korea  
free-trade agreement is estimated to boost U.S. exports to South Korea by 
$10–$11 billion, and South Korean exports to the United States by nearly  
$7 billion.3 FedEx strongly supports free-trade agreements—such as the 
KORUS FTA—that create new commercial opportunities for our customers 
and additional demand for FedEx services. In the fall of 2011, the U.S. also 
signed free-trade agreements with Colombia and Panama. FedEx will 
continue to advocate for reduced barriers to trade and increased gateways  
to Access that spring from free-trade agreements.Economics & Access
Our customers value sound environmental practices. To help them save paper, 
time, and money, we have introduced FedEx® Electronic Trade Documents, 
one of our EarthSmart Innovations. Customers in 81 countries can now submit 
customs documents electronically using Electronic Trade Documents.

We want to connect the world responsibly and resourcefully. The commercial 
transportation industry has no single solution for reducing its environmental 
footprint. But FedEx is committed to operating and innovating in new ways 
that can help our business as well as our industry. 
Environment and Efficiency is one of four specific areas where we document 
our progress each year. Along with Economics and Access, Community and 
Disaster Relief, and People and Workplace, we offer data, information, and 
examples in our annual Global Citizenship Report of how we live up to our 
responsibilities. FedEx team members contribute to our progress in these four 
important areas, their actions speaking just as loudly as the numbers that  
mark our progress.
FedEx was the first U.S. transportation-logistics company to set long-term 
goals to reduce aircraft emissions. In 2005, we set goals to reduce aircraft 
emissions 20 percent by 2020, to increase FedEx Express vehicle efficiency 
by 20 percent by 2020, and to expand on-site renewable energy generation 
and the procurement of renewable energy credits. FedEx was the first company 
in the U.S. transportation-logistics industry to establish a Citizenship Blog,  
to report global Scope 1 (direct) greenhouse-gas emissions in 2008, and to 
disclose climate risks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. For more 
information on risks reported, see pages 19 and 71 of our Securities and 
Exchange Commission  Form 10-K 2012.
Our current emissions goals include:
•	Reducing aircraft emissions intensity 30 percent by 2020, on an emissions 
per available-ton-mile basis, from a baseline year of 2005— this represents 
an increase in our global aircraft emissions intensity goal by 50 percent 
from the original target established in 2005.
•	Increasing FedEx Express vehicle efficiency by 20 percent by 2020, including 
via support of new technology, from a baseline year of 2005.
•	Getting 30 percent of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by the year 2030.
•	Expanding on-site generation of and continuing procurement of renewable 
energy for our facilities.
•	Seeking LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certification 
on all new FedEx Express buildings in the U.S.
 
Our strategy for reaching these goals includes: 
•	Minimizing our environmental footprint while serving our customers  
and growing our business.
•	Maximizing efficiencies.
•	Supporting innovation for eco-technologies.
•	Providing leadership in responsible environmental stewardship.
•	Helping connect the world in responsible and resourceful ways.
 
We continue to look at and identify our areas of exposure with regard to 
greenhouse-gas emissions and other environmental factors. We then determine 
the level of potential impact and set appropriate plans and goals needed  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR APPROACH TO CARBON 
LEGISLATION, SEE THE FOLLOWING:

Frederick W. Smith addresses the carbon tax debate while 
speaking at the Global Green Initiative Conference—  
mediacenter.fedex.designcdt.com/node/347 .
FedEx has also participated in studies that advocated such 
legislation. See the Commission for Environmental Cooperation’s 
“Destination Sustainability: Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
from Freight Transportation in North America” report—

AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HOW THE WORLD  
IS CONNECTED
to shrink our environmental footprint. Finally, we continually monitor our 
progress toward minimizing our impact and achieving our goals. 
Many departments are involved in issues of environmental stewardship. Their 
collective efforts are led by Mitch Jackson, Vice President for Environmental 
Affairs and Sustainability. In 2011, we reconstituted our governance oversight 
with the FedEx Enterprise Sustainability Council (FESC), a senior officer-level 
council that develops and guides implementation of our sustainability strategy. 
Sustainability Impact Teams were also established under the FESC management 
structure to ensure that our various operating companies can discuss, plan, 
and act in harmony on our sustainability strategy.
We also actively work with government agencies, NGOs, manufacturers, 
suppliers, and other fleet operators to introduce fuel-efficient and low-carbon, 
alternative-fuel technologies, and to promote the transformation of transportation 
through our advocacy for electrification. 
FedEx has done more than any other U.S.-based logistics and transportation 
company in this regard. FedEx was the first company in the U.S. transportation-  
logistics industry to push for commercial-vehicle, fuel-economy legislation, 
which was enacted in the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007. And 
we helped create a set of principles to inform and support this first-ever 
national greenhouse-gas/fuel-efficiency program for medium- and heavy-duty 
vehicles—the only company in our industry to do so. 2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 4Environment & Efficiency
EARTHSMART®. FEDEX SOLUTIONS FOR A 
MORE SUSTAINABLE WORLD. 
FedEx works to achieve our ambitious goals through EarthSmart, the FedEx 
roadmap for operating in an increasingly sustainable way and engaging our 
team members, customers, suppliers, vendors, and the communities where 
we operate to help us reduce the environmental impact of our daily business 
operations. We introduced EarthSmart in 2009 as a way to underscore our 
commitment to minimize our impact on the environment. Our aim is to find  
or create new ways not only to improve our own company’s environmental 
performance, but also to point the way for other companies in our own 
industry and beyond.
EarthSmart includes three pillars:
•	EarthSmart Innovations: Customer and FedEx solutions related to 
services and assets.
•	EarthSmart @ Work: Workplace employee-engagement programs.
•	EarthSmart Outreach: Philanthropic and volunteer efforts.
 
INTRODUCING FEDEX CARBON-NEUTRAL ENVELOPE SHIPPING
In April 2012, FedEx introduced our latest EarthSmart innovation—FedEx 
carbon-neutral envelope shipping. For every FedEx Express® envelope shipped, 
FedEx will offset the carbon emissions related to its transport, no matter 
where it travels. The program helps improve the carbon footprint not only at 
FedEx, but also for our customers’ businesses. But unlike our competitors, we 
won’t charge customers a fee to offset the carbon produced when they ship 
an envelope.
We calculate the emissions it takes to transport an envelope to its destination, 
and we pay an offset provider to offset those emissions for every envelope 
we carry. The annual estimated carbon offset by this program is equivalent 
to planting 2,179,487 seedlings and letting them grow for 10 years.EARTHSMART INNOVATIONS: CUSTOMER AND FEDEX 
SOLUTIONS RELATED TO SERVICES AND ASSETS
FedEx carbon-neutral envelope shipping: 
FedEx seeks to transport documents around the world in a way 
that neutralizes carbon emissions—at no extra charge. FedEx 
Express works with BP Target Neutral, a not-for-profit offset 
provider that helps to reduce, replace, and neutralize carbon by 
investing in offsets for every envelope shipment.

EMBARQ: 
FedEx works with EMBARQ, the World Resources Institute’s 
Center for Sustainable Transport, to help eliminate congestion, 
air pollution, and unsafe roads for people living in Mexico, 
Brazil, and India.

FedEx supports the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in  
its efforts to preserve and restore U.S. native wildlife species  
and habitats.  
To learn more about our EarthSmart programs, go to  
earthsmart.fedex.com/ .We work with BP Target Neutral, a not-for-profit offset provider whose projects 
reduce, replace, and neutralize carbon. Currently, BP Target Neutral invests 
in six large carbon-offset projects, which will offset the carbon FedEx 
emits transporting envelopes. Projects are located in: China–micro hydro; 
The Netherlands–biogas; Tanzania–reforestation; Thailand–landfill-to-gas; 
Turkey–wind power; and U.S.–landfill-to-gas. For more information on this

ENTERPRISE CO2 EMISSIONS
Our Scope 1 and 3 CO2 emissions increased slightly in FY11 due to increased 
shipping volumes, which came with improved global economic conditions and 
strong demand for our services. However, we have made progress in decoupling 
economic growth from our direct greenhouse-gas emissions during that time 
period. Our average daily package volumes at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground 
increased by 5 percent, and our average daily LTL (less-than-truckload) shipments 
at FedEx Freight grew by 4.5 percent, while our Scope 1 CO2 absolute emissions 
increased by only 3 percent in FY11 compared with FY10. During that same 
time, we increased our total annual revenue by 13 percent. 
DEFINING SCOPE EMISSIONS
Our Scope 1 emissions include those generated by our company-operated 
aircraft and surface vehicle fleets, and on-site combustion of diesel, natural 
gas, and other fuels used at our hub, station, and office locations.
Our Scope 2 emissions are indirectly generated through our consumption  
of purchased electricity, heat, and steam at our facilities and FedEx Office 
Print and Ship Centers. In FY11, our Scope 2 emissions decreased slightly due 
to ongoing energy efficiency initiatives at our facilities (see “Greening Our 
Facilities” for more information).
Our Scope 3 emissions comprise other indirect emissions, including those from 
FedEx Express feeder aircraft contract operators and the fuel we sell to FedEx 
Ground independent contractors.
We compiled our greenhouse emissions inventory using data and emissions 
factors in accordance with World Resources Institute technical guidance. AIRCRAFT EMISSIONS
We calculate aircraft emissions intensity metrics by dividing the total CO2 
emissions of our company-operated aircraft by the available ton miles (ATM), 
or the tons of carrying capacity by miles traveled.
In previous years, we tracked and reported this data on a calendar-year basis. 
However, in order to be consistent with how we report on other data in this 
report, we are transitioning to a fiscal-year reporting basis for this metric 
going forward. 
Our previous goal by 2020 was to reduce our CO2 emissions intensity or 
emissions per available ton mile by 20 percent as compared with our 2005 
performance. We are pleased to announce that FedEx has increased our global 
aircraft emissions intensity goal by 50 percent to a 30 percent intensity 
reduction by 2020, still using FY05 as the baseline year. In FY11, we reduced 
aircraft CO2 emissions intensity by 4 percent, bringing our cumulative reduction 
to 13.8 percent compared with FY05. The majority of this reduction was due 
to replacement of older, more-inefficient aircraft.
 
By 2015, we will have replaced all our less-efficient 727s with more fuel-efficient 
and greater payload 757 aircraft. We are also introducing Boeing 777F aircraft, 
which use 18 percent less fuel than the MD-11 aircraft and provide greater 
payload capacity. In addition, we are planning to introduce the new Boeing 
767 aircraft to our fleet in FY13, which will further contribute to our ability to 
meet our newly revised aircraft emissions intensity reduction target.
Other operational activities play a significant role, and these advancements  
are managed under our Fuel Sense program. We have programs to optimize 
fuel usage from gate to gate, starting with preflight. For example, aircraft auxiliary 
power unit (APU) usage is managed by providing ground support equipment Aircraft Emissions

EMPLOYEE-ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS
Fuel Sense: 
Optimization of flight planning, aircraft weight reduction, and flight 
efficiencies are a few of the 30 different Fuel Sense programs. 
Fuel Sense helped cut our jet fuel consumption by 40.5 million 
gallons and CO2 emissions by nearly 388,000 metric tons in FY11. 
Reduce, Replace, and Revolutionize:
Includes restructuring FedEx Express routes to reduce  miles  
driven and vehicles needed, matching vehicles to routes by energy  
requirements, and using smart charging algorithms to control the  
impact on the electric grid. 
To learn more about our EarthSmart programs, go to  
earthsmart.fedex.com /. in parking positions. To supplement ground support equipment, gate stands 
provide power from either a power converter or a portable power unit, and 
portable air conditioning carts keep the aircraft cool in hot summer months. 
This equipment is monitored in real time and information is provided to all 
the stakeholders, from ground support teams that can track the portable units 
in real time and dispatch them to the required gate to the flight crewmembers 
so they can determine when to start the APU.
We also have gate-to-gate programs to facilitate taxiing with one less engine 
and for optimized profile descent (also known as continuous descent approach) 
prior to landing. These procedures provide a repeatable and predictable 
trajectory that both Air Traffic Control and crewmembers can use to minimize 
fuel usage. We also have a mechanism for crewmembers to share new ideas 
and provide feedback on their individual contributions to the program.
Whether on the ground or in the air, in every phase of the flight, preflight, taxi, 
takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, landing, and taxi, we look for programs to 
optimize fuel usage and reduce emissions. At FedEx, small changes through 
individual contributions amount to a big impact in emission reductions over 
many daily operations worldwide.
VEHICLE FUEL EFFICIENCY
Our goal for 2020 is to improve the fuel efficiency of the FedEx Express  
surface/delivery vehicle fleet by 20 percent, using 2005 as the baseline year.  
We are happy to announce that we are still on track to meet that target, having  
achieved a 16.6 percent improvement in the FedEx Express vehicle fleet between 
FY05 and FY11.  
The FedEx Express pickup and delivery vehicle fleet follows a three-tiered  
approach to improve vehicle fuel efficiency: Reduce, Replace, and Revolutionize.  
This means we develop vehicle technologies for the future while making the 
best use of the conventional vehicles we operate today. FedEx Express has 
increased the size of its alternative-fuel fleet by 18 percent in FY12, with a total  
of 364 hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) and 118 electric vehicles (EVs) in service 
by the end of FY12. These vehicles saved 345,000 gallons of fuel and logged 
12.1 million miles since being introduced to our fleet. We also continue to retrofit  
conventional internal-combustion-engine vehicles to make our local delivery  
vehicles more fuel efficient through our “Vehicle Refresh Plan.” Our engineers  Vehicle Fuel Efficiency

FedEx low-emission, hybrid-electric vehicles: 
Our fleet of FedEx Express vehicles has reduced fuel consumption 
in North America, Europe, and Asia by more than 25 percent from 
the vehicles they replace. 
FedEx zero-emission, all-electric vehicles: 
Our fleet of FedEx Express zero-emission, all-electric vehicles 
reduces emissions and pollution around the world. As a part  
of our effort to right-size our traditional fleet and restructure 
routes for more efficiency, these changes have helped us save  
75 million gallons of fuel.
To learn more about our EarthSmart programs, go to  
earthsmart.fedex.com /.FedEx Express also expanded its Eco-Drive program to 10 Asia-Pacific markets: 
Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, 
Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Experts from Isuzu Motors teach FedEx 
drivers how to operate vehicles more efficiently, increasing their awareness 
of energy conservation, environmental protection, and general road safety. 
FedEx Office has adopted technology from our other operating companies  
to help make routing of our local delivery vehicle fleet more efficient. This 
includes creating a national centralized dispatch facility and testing all-electric 
vans in Washington, D.C., and hybrid vehicles in other markets.
FedEx continues to be actively engaged in a variety of cross-sector and public-  
private collaborations to identify and pilot new technologies to improve the fuel 
efficiency of the global logistics industry’s vehicle fleet. This effort is reducing 
the entire industry’s greenhouse-gas emissions. These technological innovations 
include making hybrid and electric drivetrains more affordable and scalable, 
improving the fuel economy of conventional internal-combustion-engine vehicles, 
and developing an international infrastructure for vehicle electrification. 
FedEx works with the U.S. Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), vehicle component manufacturers, and other commercial-vehicle-
fleet owners through the CALSTART Hybrid Truck Users Forum to promote 
adoption of hybrid-electric and hydraulic commercial delivery trucks in the 
marketplace. Through these relationships, each FedEx operating company 
focuses on technologies that are specifically relevant to their operations and 
that will ultimately benefit our other operating companies—with FedEx Express 
exploring advancements in electric vehicle transmissions, FedEx Ground 
evaluating innovations in hydraulic hybrid technology, and FedEx Freight exploring 
the feasibility of using Liquefied Natural Gas for Class 8 long-haul trucks. 
FedEx operating companies are also active in the EPA’s SmartWay program 
and the Department of Energy’s newly established National Clean Fleets 
Partnership to foster cooperation around fuel-efficiency innovation across 
the entire commercial-vehicle value chain. The EPA SmartWay Transport 
Partnership creates a market mechanism that gives carriers and shippers 
incentive to improve the efficiency of their operations, increase environmental 
performance, and increase supply chain sustainability. SmartWay partners 
agree to benchmark and assess freight operations, calculate fuel consumption, 
and track fuel efficiency. EPA creates reporting tools, calculates emissions, 
and publicizes partners’ performance on the SmartWay Partner List. Four of the 
FedEx operating companies (Custom Critical, Express, Freight, and Ground) 
are currently members of the EPA SmartWay Transport Partnership. For more 
information on the SmartWay program, visit http://www.epa.gov/smartway/ .
In addition, FedEx Chairman and CEO Frederick W. Smith’s continued advocacy 
for commercial vehicle electrification through Securing America’s Future 
Energy (SAFE), where he serves as co-chair, is helping to drive a more strategic 
approach to ensuring that the U.S. is at the forefront of the alternative-fuel 
vehicle revolution.2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 8Environment & Efficiency
FedEx has generated over 18 gigawatt-hours of solar electricity since we built 
our first solar facility. We now have six solar-energy facilities, five in the U.S. 
and one in Europe. These six facilities alone have reduced CO2 emissions by 
an estimated 6,858 metric tons. This is roughly equivalent to 768,834 gallons 
of gasoline or 175,846 tree seedlings growing for 10 years, based on the EPA’s 
Greenhouse Gas Equivalence Calculator. 
The FedEx Express 350,000-square-foot solar-powered facility in Oakland, Calif., 
was the largest commercial solar rooftop installation at the time it was built 
in 2005. More than 5,700 solar-electric panels cover the 81,000 square feet 
of roof space, producing 904 kilowatts of power. In 2008, FedEx Freight 
introduced two solar-power installations at facilities in Whittier and Fontana, 
Calif., both systems providing a substantial portion of the facilities’ annual 
electricity needs. 
In late 2009, FedEx Ground installed the nation’s then-largest rooftop 
solar-electric system at its distribution hub in Woodbridge, N.J. Capable of 
producing approximately 2.6 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, the 
system provides up to 30 percent of the hub’s annual energy needs. The 
solar-electric system at the FedEx Express facility in Cologne, Germany, went 
online in 2010 and has produced nearly 1.8 gigawatt-hours of power to date.  
In May 2011, the 1.13-megawatt FedEx Ground Rialto, Calif., solar electricity 
system went online and meets approximately 30 percent of that facility’s 
annual electricity needs.
The FedEx Express Oakland, Calif., hub is also using Bloom Energy Fuel Cell 
technology for electric generation. FedEx installed five 100-kilowatt fuel cells 
at the hub, which can run on almost any hydrocarbon fuel—ethanol, biodiesel, 
methane, and natural gas. These fuel cells require no combustion, producing GREENING OUR FACILITIES
RENEWABLE AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
Solar Electricityvirtually no NOx, SOx, or other smog-forming particulates. Running on natural  
gas, the fuel cells provide each facility with 500 kilowatts of electricity by 
converting natural gas to electricity. They thereby reduce the strain and 
dependency on the local electrical distribution grid and further our strategic 
investment in innovative technologies.
RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS
In addition to the renewable energy generated on-site, FedEx Office purchased 
33,333 renewable energy credits (REC) to offset emissions associated with 
the electricity used in FY11 and to support efforts to generate electricity 
from renewable sources. Each REC purchased represents 1,000 kilowatt-hours 
of electricity produced by a renewable energy facility.
In addition, FedEx Ground recently purchased 1,855 Green E-certified, “NewMix” 
National Wind RECs, equating to an offset of 2,033,433 pounds of CO2 emissions 
for the associated indirect grid electricity emissions at seven hub and station 
locations in Pennsylvania. This initial purchase was part of a recent strategically 
designed energy procurement effort whose ultimate goal is to offset the 
Scope 2 emissions associated with electricity consumed at more than 500 FedEx 
Ground facilities in the U.S. and Canada.
LEED® CERTIFIED FACILITIES
All new, and some existing, FedEx Express U.S. buildings will seek LEED 
(Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certification. These certifications 
help FedEx to conserve energy, improve the environment, and create a better 
workplace. The FedEx Express Las Vegas facility was the first to earn LEED 
certification, reducing indoor water use by 49 percent compared with 
code-compliant plumbing, improving energy savings by 42 percent through 
design elements such as skylights and evaporative cooling, diverting 86 percent 
of all construction waste through recycling and reclamation of materials, and 
ensuring that more than 75 percent of regularly occupied spaces are sunlit  
to reduce the need for electric lights and provide better workspaces.
The FedEx Express World Headquarters in Memphis received LEED Gold 
certification in January 2011, under the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED  
for Existing Buildings Rating System. The FedEx Enterprise Data Center-West, 
in Colorado Springs, Colo., is now certified LEED Gold under the new rating 
system for new construction and is a winner of International Data Group’s 
InfoWorld Green 15 Award. Two additional FedEx stations in Houston, Texas, 
were certified as LEED Silver in the fall of 2011, and the certifications of five 
other facilities are pending.Renewable Energy Credits

When it comes to green roofs at airports, nothing in the country tops the FedEx 
Express cargo facility at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. The new 
O’Hare FedEx Express package-sorting center conducts operations under the 
largest continuous vegetated roof at an airport in the U.S.: It is the size of 
three football fields. FedEx and the Chicago Department of Aviation are also 
pursuing LEED Gold certification for the facility, extending the company’s

FACILITIES WITH ISO 14001 CERTIFICATION
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 provides a framework 
for a holistic, strategic approach to an organization’s environmental policy, 
plans, and actions. It outlines requirements for environmental management 
systems, and 51 of our facilities meet those requirements. In 1999, FedEx 
Express began implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS) 
to provide a formal process to improve environmental efficiency and performance. 
With the help of Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance, a gap analysis was 
completed, and FedEx Express instituted an EMS that is based upon ISO 14001 
requirements for its U.S. locations. Fifty FedEx facilities in the United Kingdom 
in September 2008 became the first FedEx locations to achieve ISO 14001 
certification. This was followed by certification of the FedEx international 
hub in Paris, France. 
We continue to deploy the EMS globally, and FedEx is evaluating the feasibility 
of obtaining ISO 14001 certification in other markets and at other facilities. 
In the interim, the FedEx corporate EMS will continue to be based upon elements 
in the ISO 14001 standard. It includes a corporate policy that guides decision 
making and procedure manuals that provide clear direction to site personnel. 
The EMS includes a website that educates team members on environmental 
responsibilities, contacts for assistance, environmental stewardship actions 
by FedEx, and programs in which team members can participate. In addition, 
the EMS contains extensive computer-based and classroom training for team 
members and the use of a regulatory tracking system to maintain awareness 
of changes in applicable laws. The EMS also includes an Environmental 
Management Information System to aid in retaining and analyzing key 
environmental data.EARTHSMART INNOVATIONS: CUSTOMER AND FEDEX

Waste Streams
WASTE STREAMS AND RECYCLING  
WASTE STREAMS
The majority of our waste is considered nonhazardous and municipal solid 
waste, much like regular household garbage. The remaining waste streams 
include: hazardous waste, which is dangerous or potentially harmful to human 
health or the environment; “universal waste,” which includes batteries, 
pesticides, mercury-containing equipment, and light bulbs; and e-waste, such 
as obsolete handheld scanners, computers, and peripheral devices. We are 
working toward a goal of reporting the total solid-waste generated at our 
global facilities across our enterprise in the near future. 2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 10customers in the field. Through its innovative designs, the RSC delivers fast 
and flexible quality solutions to satisfy customer needs. 
In 2007, the RSC relocated to a new 138,000-square-foot facility in Collierville, 
Tenn. To maintain our commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, the 
new facility features a highly automated sort system. This state-of-the-art 
electronic repair facility continues to provide our customers with our Best Cost 
Performance and Best in Class repair operations, while providing increased 
security for the equipment entrusted to us for repair. RECYCLING
In FY11, we recycled 6.4 million more pounds of the waste generated at our 
facilities than we did in FY10. Based on the waste generation we currently 
track, our recycling rose 10 points, to 36 percent in FY11.
At FedEx, we’ve found opportunities to extend the useful life of a number of 
materials we use at our business through recycling programs. These efforts 
help divert millions of pounds from landfills. For example, our in-store recycling 
program at FedEx Office allows us to recycle waste in a secure fashion, and in 
2011, FedEx Office locations recycled more than five million pounds of paper, 
saving almost 8,000 cubic yards of landfill space and over 44,000 trees through 
that program.
The EarthSmart @ Work programs—Ground Green, Freight Waste Watch, and 
FedEx Office Paper Recycling—are finding ways to responsibly recycle everything 
from paper to motor oil. And in some cases, we are even reselling our recycled 
packaging. EarthSmart @ Work will continue to challenge our team members 
to find new ways to recycle and/or reuse a significant percentage of waste, 
including nonhazardous, hazardous, universal, and e-waste. 
U.S. domestic e-waste generated by our operating companies is processed 
by the FedEx TechConnect Repair Service Center (RSC) and then sent to an 
external domestic e-waste recycler. FedEx has been a leader in using innovative 
technologies to power our global shipping and information networks. For 
more than 30 years, FedEx has put a high priority on keeping these technologies 
in top working order, and our team of highly trained FedEx technology-repair 
specialists has always met this unique challenge. The RSC provides repair

suppliers that have been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), 
which helps ensure responsible forest management. In FY11, we increased 
the percentage of FSC-certified paper used in our FedEx Office Print and Ship 
Centers to 80 percent. 
At our 1,800-plus FedEx Office locations in the U.S., Canada, and internationally, 
we provide consumers sustainable solutions to choose from through our diverse 
portfolio of paper-product offerings. More than 70 percent of our paper 
products contain recycled content. We also offer tree-free paper selections 
made from natural plant fibers such as cotton. Through FedEx Office, we 
provide services to efficiently transmit digitized information, so customers 
can have documents professionally printed and finished closer to where 
they are needed, reducing the resources required to physically transport 
shipments—and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
In addition, all of the FedEx operating companies are working to increase the 
amount of responsibly sourced paper used for internal operations. For instance, 
in FY11 we increased the percentage of paper produced from recycled content 
that we track to 16 percent from 6 percent, resulting in an overall increase 
of 141 percent for that type of paper consumed in our offices and facilities. 
This increase was due both to improved reporting of recycled paper usage by 
our key supplier as well as enhanced product offerings to meet the demand 
for recycled paper content across the enterprise. 
PACKAGING
For more than a decade, we have worked to minimize the environmental impact 
of our packaging wherever possible by using recycled content and maximizing 
recyclability. At the FedEx Packaging Lab, our engineers use the latest materials 
and tools to solve shipping challenges, including environmental ones, and 
today, most FedEx packaging is recyclable and contains recycled materials.
•	The iconic FedEx Express® overnight envelope is composed of 100 percent 
recycled paperboard. 
•	FedEx® 10-kilogram and 25-kilogram boxes contain a minimum  
of 70 percent recycled content and are recyclable. PAPER AND PACKAGING

With a continued focus on saving energy and reducing materials, we have 
made minor changes to our packaging with major results. For example, in 2001, 
we reduced the amount of plastic in the FedEx® envelope pouch by almost 
500,000 pounds per year. In 2003, we introduced a legal-size reusable envelope 
that uses dual tear-strips to extend the usefulness of the product while 
cutting waste. In 2004, we increased the recycled content of the FedEx Pak 
from 25 percent to 60 percent. And as recently as this year, we changed the 
material of the legal-size reusable FedEx Envelope, which resulted in an annual 
paperboard reduction of 100,000 pounds. 2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 12Environment & Efficiency

cardboard packaging into a flexible packing material called “cardboard shred.” 
This cardboard shred now replaces traditional packing materials such as 
Styrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap, and it diverts tons of used cardboard 
from landfills. These machines can also cut the cardboard shred into a variety 
of sizes, allowing for repacking of different size boxes, and are portable enough 
to fit easily in local sorting stations where space is limited. Since 2009, 
FedEx Ground has placed 40 of these machines at key hubs and stations so 
far, with an annual estimated rate of return of 13 percent on this investment  
by eliminating the need to purchase new packing materials.
In addition, the boxes used to send paper reams to FedEx Office locations  
are made of top-tier green materials. The paperboard utilized for these boxes 
is a chip paperboard that is 100 percent recycled, 100 percent recyclable, and  
100 percent made from post-consumer reclaimed fiber. And it is printed with 
water- and soy-based inks. This product is certified by the Forestry Stewardship 
Council, as are the facilities that manufacture the box.

to the Environment program has two main aims. First, it recognizes and rewards 
companies that are leading the way in understanding and addressing their 
environmental impact. Second, it establishes a standard for environmental 
responsibility, encouraging companies through example to make similar efforts 
and address their environmental impact in a realistic, forward-thinking, and 
sustainable way.
FedEx also earned the Corporate Balance Award from the Lindbergh Foundation 
in 2010, in recognition of the great strides we have taken to become an 
environmentally responsible corporation. And in 2012, the Lindbergh Foundation 
announced that FedEx has joined the Aviation Green Alliance as a Founding 
Member. The Aviation Green Alliance was established to create multiple 
platforms for members to share strategies, findings, progress, and ideas 
related to aviation’s environmental challenges. For more information, visit

four important areas, their actions speaking just as loudly as the numbers 
that mark our progress.
With Community and Disaster Relief, our investments work in important and 
meaningful ways within three core focus areas: 
Emergency and Disaster Relief
FedEx works with a number of international disaster response organizations 
that bring relief to victims of emergencies or natural disasters. Specifically, 
we direct our funds toward the quick and efficient transport of aid and disaster 
preparedness education initiatives.
Child Pedestrian Safety
FedEx is interested in supporting organizations that help keep child pedestrians  
safe through increasing awareness and knowledge of pedestrian safety as 
an issue, helping change unsafe child pedestrian behaviors, and/or creating 
environmental improvements to keep child pedestrians safe in local communities.
Environmental Sustainability
FedEx prioritizes philanthropic and volunteer efforts that benefit the environment 
and strategically align with our business goals. We focus our investments to 
create sustainable transportation solutions in the developing world to support 
healthy urban environments, preserve valuable ecosystems, and identify  
new ways to balance access to trade and investment with responsible 
environmental stewardship.

EMERGENCY AND DISASTER RELIEF
Recognizing that because of the nature of our business FedEx will continue 
to be at the forefront of relief efforts, our major focus for charitable shipping is 
emergency and disaster relief. FedEx primarily aligns with four nonprofit agencies 
to coordinate relief efforts:
•	American Red Cross
•	Direct Relief International
•	Heart to Heart International
•	The Salvation Army
 Overall, FedEx donated space for 5.2 million pounds of charitable shipping 
globally. Converting this donation, FedEx Express transported the equivalent of 
87 planes (Boeing 757Fs) in donated aid. A total of 142 truckloads and  
57 LTL (less-than-truckload) loads were transported through FedEx Custom 
Critical and FedEx Freight. 
AMERICAN RED CROSS
FedEx has provided in-kind shipping, financial support, and volunteers to the 
American Red Cross for 17 years. We are its largest transportation donor and 
are recognized as the backbone of its U.S. disaster logistics system. The 
majority of our charitable shipping was donated to the American Red Cross 
(1 million pounds). 
Beginning in April 2011, disaster response ramped up in the U.S. with an 
unprecedented 35 large-scale disasters in 24 states. During the month of May, 
FedEx supported the American Red Cross by providing 30 truckloads and 
$96,000 of in-kind shipping through FedEx Express. This included 4,871 shipments 
weighing 199,311 pounds, our largest disaster response in the U.S. since 
Hurricane Katrina.

In addition to vital relief supplies, FedEx also transports laptop computers, 
cell phones, and other vital communications equipment from the American 
Red Cross technology warehouse in Austin, Texas. The timely arrival of 
logistical support enables the American Red Cross to continue with every 
disaster response as efficiently as possible.
DIRECT RELIEF INTERNATIONAL
FedEx supported the delivery of 2,309 shipments to Direct Relief International’s 
healthcare partners—an increase of 204 percent from the previous project 
term. In total, these shipments weighed 366,453 pounds and contained 
$37.1 million (wholesale) worth of medicines, medical supplies, and equipment. 
Direct Relief supports more than 1,000 clinics and health centers every year, 
with shipping donated by FedEx.
HEART TO HEART INTERNATIONAL
We use our network to help Heart to Heart International ship donated medical  
supplies around the world. Additionally, a new Heart to Heart initiative called 
the “Ready Relief Box” is part of the donated medical shipment program. 
These sturdy containers, built to withstand travel and the elements, contain 
enough medicine to treat 400 people. FedEx transports them free of charge 
to medical teams worldwide. 
RELIEF EFFORTS IN HAITI
One year after the devastating earthquake in Haiti, FedEx continued to support 
the global relief efforts there through the American Red Cross, Heart to Heart 
International, Direct Relief International, and Water Missions International. 
To date, we have provided more than $2 million of in-kind and cash support 
for the earthquake relief efforts in Haiti. 
Within seven days after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, FedEx had shipped more 
than 500,000 pounds, and within the first month, FedEx shipped more than  
1 million pounds. With the cholera outbreak, emergency shipments expanded 
American Red Cross
Direct Relief International
to reach a total of 2 million pounds. FedEx delivered 1 million sachets of oral 
rehydration salts for cholera victims for the American Red Cross. Each packet 
mixes with one liter of water and helps replace water and electrolytes lost. 
Our Miami international agents donated time to prepare the paperwork and 
logistics for 33 tons on three shipments. About 450,000 people in Haiti now 
receive clean water following the shipment of 60 water purification units 
from Water Missions International. FedEx Trade Networks also donated the  
shipping to bring 5,000 cots, weighing 59 tons, to the American Red Cross  
for use by cholera victims in hospitals.
RELIEF EFFORTS IN JAPAN
After a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the northeast of Japan on  
March 11, 2011, Japanese Emergency NGOs (JEN), a local nonprofit organization  
with long-term support from FedEx in Japan, established a volunteer center  
in Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture, which suffered greatly in the devastating 
quake and tsunami. 
 
On April 12, 2011, JEN, together with other nonprofit organizations and individual  
volunteers, began a series of workshops called “Mud Busters” aimed at 
removing mud from the houses still habitable. FedEx volunteers were bused 
in from Tokyo, and through this effort, the harmful dust and health risks 
associated with dried mud were reduced. Overall, FedEx contributed $1 million 
to provide support for those affected by the disaster, and almost 100 FedEx 
employees volunteered for the effort. 
Volunteers from FedEx Express Japan and JEN also worked together to 
harvest rice in the Iketani and Iriyama villages, Niigata Prefecture. The rice 
harvest was the third phase in an agricultural volunteer program designed  
to help revitalize an area affected by the 2004 Niigata Chuetsu earthquake.
RELIEF EFFORTS IN AFRICA
In response to the 2011 famine in Somalia, FedEx Express delivered approximately 
182 metric tons (400,000 pounds) of high-nutrient food to Nairobi, Kenya. The 
charitable initiative was organized in collaboration with UNICEF with the aim 
of offering life-saving assistance to severely malnourished children in south 
and central Somalia. To complete the large-scale humanitarian mission, FedEx 
used a Boeing 777F aircraft for two relief flights. The in-kind donations currently 
make FedEx the single largest provider of philanthropic air lifts of aid for 
UNICEF in response to the famine in Somalia. Together, the loads helped 
treat over 6,000 severely malnourished children and provided fortified food 
for 4,000 families for two weeks.2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 5Community & Disaster Relief
WORLD RESOURCES INSTITUTE–EMBARQ
FedEx actively works with EMBARQ, the World Resources Institute’s  
Center for Sustainable Transport. EMBARQ helps cities design safe, efficient, 
and environmentally responsible transportation networks that deal with the 
challenges of traffic congestion and pollution. The collaboration between 
FedEx and EMBARQ provides the potential for a better environment, less 
congestion, increased safety, and enhanced competitiveness in cities where 
we do business. Given our extensive knowledge of vehicle technologies and 
traffic patterns in the world’s cities, we believe we have much to contribute.
In 2011, FedEx announced a two-year, $1.4 million collaboration with EMBARQ  
to optimize city bus operations in Mexico, Brazil, and India. The funds will 
enable EMBARQ to provide technical expertise on sustainable transportation 
projects that improve the quality of life in cities. The grant builds upon the 
successful collaboration between FedEx and EMBARQ’s Center for Sustainable 
Transport, which began in February 2010 with a $500,000 grant to help 
Mexico City’s Metrobus optimize its vehicle operations. FedEx will also work 
with EMBARQ’s Research and Practice team to create a decision support 
system for helping Brazilian cities choose, based on cost-effectiveness and 
environmental benefits, the best fuel and vehicle technologies for new 
transit systems. 
In 2011, EMBARQ and FedEx launched the EMBARQ–FedEx Fellowship,  
a two-year program that equips promising staff in EMBARQ’s Mexico,  
Brazil, and India offices to make an impact in their respective communities  
by completing a leadership and technical training curriculum at FedEx 
corporate headquarters and using that knowledge for their work in their 
respective countries. 
THE KEYSTONE CENTER: STUDENTS FOR SUSTAINABLE CITIES 
In 2011, FedEx support enabled The Keystone Center to launch a new program  
in Pittsburgh called Students for Sustainable Cities. The Students for 
Sustainable Cities curriculum enables teachers and students to explore the 
ways environmental health, social well-being, and economic vitality are 
interconnected while creating lasting change in their communities and schools. 
Teachers and students will share their plans with students in their schools 
and engage students in the community action projects they have chosen. The 
program started with a two-day workshop for teachers and students, and  
is now part of a larger curriculum unit that runs through 2012. 
NATIONAL FISH AND WILDLIFE FOUNDATION 
In 2010, FedEx supported urban conservation projects in six cities and 
expanded to 12 cities in 2011. FedEx team members in Seattle, San Francisco,  
Los Angeles, Dallas, Memphis, Chicago, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Boston, 
New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., participated in a variety  
of activities, including tree plantings, green roof installations, schoolyard 
greening, and waterway clean-ups. Results from 2011 include: CHILD PEDESTRIAN SAFETY: SAFE KIDS
Together with Safe Kids Worldwide, FedEx established the Safe Kids Walk 
This Way program to teach drivers and child pedestrians about safe 
behaviors and to create safer, more walkable communities. The goal of this 
joint initiative is to prevent pedestrian-related injury to children. Since the 
launch of the program in 2000, Safe Kids Walk This Way has enabled FedEx 
volunteers to reach families in thousands of communities around the world. 
Safe Kids Walk This Way programming includes annual events as well as 
year-round initiatives. With programs in nine countries—U.S., China, Brazil, 
India, Canada, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines—hundreds 
of thousands of children, teachers, and parents each year join FedEx 
volunteers to celebrate International Walk to School Day activities. These 
local celebrations include mass walks to school, educational programs, and 
opportunities for community leaders to shine a light on a particular pedestrian 
safety issue in their communities. Important local issues highlighted have 
included unsafe intersections, schools that lack crossing guards, and streets 
where there are no safe sidewalks.
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
EarthSmart is our commitment to connecting the world in responsible and 
resourceful ways. We designed the program to promote innovative solutions 
not only in our networks, our customer solutions, and our workplaces, but 
also in the communities where we operate. EarthSmart Outreach aligns global 
philanthropic and volunteer efforts with the company’s focus on environmental 
sustainability in three key areas:
Sustainable Transportation
Reduces emissions and congestion; enhances safety; expands accessibility.
Sustainable Cities 
Supports healthy, environmentally responsible urban environments.
Sustainable Ecosystems
Promotes ecosystem viability through sustainable forestry and habitat 
preservation before and after disasters.

OPERATION WARM
Operation Warm began with a simple focus: providing U.S. children with new 
winter coats. FedEx provided logistics expertise and created a distribution 
system that delivered 200,000 coats last year. FedEx volunteers in key 
markets receive the coats in shipments from China and assist Operation 
Warm with distribution to local agencies.
DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE HABITATS
FedEx has been involved in a number of efforts dedicated to helping the 
world’s animal population find sustainable habitats. 
•	Recently, two orphaned grizzly cubs were shipped by FedEx from Alaska  
to Indiana. The cubs were about 10 months old when Alaska Fish and 
Wildlife officials euthanized their mother. We worked with the 
Indianapolis Zoo on the rescue shipment.
•	Working with the Wild Animal Sanctuary outside of Denver, Colo., FedEx 
provided the transportation to rescue three ailing lionesses from Panama 
to their new home in the sanctuary. 
•	As winter approached, Topeka Zoo in Kansas found it had run out of  
indoor space for its growing hippopotamus family. FedEx helped relocate 
Tucker the hippo to San Francisco, giving Tucker a new warm home.
•	FedEx moved three rescued grizzly cubs from Anchorage, Alaska, to 
Detroit. The three brothers were orphaned by a poacher in Alaska and 
were given a permanent home in the Detroit Zoo.
•	When a Texas couple ended their marriage in divorce, the four hand-raised 
tigers used for supplemental income faced euthanasia. FedEx transported 
the cats to their new home in California’s Oakland Zoo.
•	FedEx made two separate shipments of two giant pandas each aboard  
a specially branded Boeing 777F, the “FedEx Panda Express.” The pandas 
traveled in custom-built enclosures and were professionally transported 
from China to their new homes in Scotland and France. The arrival of the 
pandas marks the first time in more than 17 years that giant pandas will 
reside in the U.K. and more than 10 years in France.
 
EDUCATION
Education is a strategic giving area at FedEx which invests charitable dollars, 
volunteer hours, and expertise to educational institutions and organizations 
preparing students to participate in the global economy. FedEx focuses  
on three areas:
Access
Engage students in the global economy.
Innovation
Support reform that closes the achievement gap.•	More than 15,510 trees and shrubs planted.
•	More than 200 acres of urban wildlife restored.
•	Reduced the amount of polluted storm water entering urban rivers  
by more than 570,000 gallons per year.
•	Mobilized more than 9,000 community members to engage in  
on-the-ground conservation.
 
OTHER CHARITABLE SHIPPING  
AND STRATEGIC GIVING
In addition to our three core focus areas of Emergency and Disaster Relief, 
Child Pedestrian Safety, and Environmental Sustainability, FedEx provides 
additional charitable shipping, education programs, strategic community 
investment, and other local efforts that support service initiatives of our 
team members.
FIRST ROBOTICS
FedEx celebrated our 10th year of providing shipping support for FIRST Robotics 
(For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) by donating 
team-built robot crates. Total shipments equaled 800,000 pounds of in-kind 
shipping in FY11, the second-largest recurring charitable shipping program  
we sponsor. Our collaboration with FIRST Robotics encourages students 
across the globe to embrace technology, innovation, and forward-thinking. 
For the past 10 years, FedEx has been supporting teams across the U.S. and 
world with donated shipping. In FY11, FedEx supported 3,000 teams with 
210,000 youth and more than 90,000 mentors, coaches, and volunteers from 
56 countries. Donated shipping provided support for student teams responsible 
for designing, building, and programming their robots to compete in an alliance 
format against other teams. Teams are required to develop strategy and build 
robots based on sound engineering principles. 
INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN’S HEART FOUNDATION
For the past 12 years, we have provided medical shipments for Memphis- based 
International Children’s Heart Foundation. A team of surgeons donates its 
time, and the foundation recently reached a life-saving milestone, providing 
3,000 children in 20 countries with free open-heart surgery.

Diversity
Advance opportunities for minorities through higher education.
Access
When global connections form, local economies flourish, jobs are created, 
and people prosper. At FedEx, we are passionate about expanding the reach 
of this force we call Access, and our work with Junior Achievement (JA) helps 
younger generations learn more about its potential.
FedEx has supported Junior Achievement for more than 20 years, through 
various funding opportunities and initiatives. Our team members also volunteer 
their time and expertise to educate students on business, trade, and economies 
around the world.
FedEx supports the Junior Achievement Company of the Year competitions in 
North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. 
The JA Company Program helps high school students appreciate and understand 
the role of business in our society by organizing and operating an actual 
enterprise. FedEx also supports Junior Achievement in multiple U.S. markets, 
providing FedEx strong local visibility and opportunities for team members 
to educate and mentor students. These markets include Memphis, Indianapolis, 
New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Colorado Springs, and Oakland.
Innovation and Diversity
FedEx has made increasing investments in helping to close the achievement 
gap. We support innovative organizations that create opportunities for 
students, such as New Leaders for New Schools and Teach For America (TFA). 
FedEx also provides support to Teach For All, the international organization,  
to expand similar programs in our Latin America-Caribbean region.
FedEx has invested more than $1.75 million since FY07 in Teach For America’s 
national and regional operations. The commitment supports TFA National 
Diversity and Inclusiveness programs, enabling TFA to:
•	Broaden the diversity of people applying to the program, with 34 percent 
of the 2011–2012 applicants identifying themselves as a person of color.
•	Engage thousands in the Community Speaker Series on educational inequity.
•	Bring more than 200 corps members to Memphis, helping nearly 
15,000 students.
•	Bring almost 200 Rising Leader undergraduates to Washington, D.C.,  
to become advocates for closing the achievement gap.
•	Engage more than 25 executives during Teach For America Week in Newark, 
Dallas, Memphis, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Miami, and Washington, D.C. 
FedEx executives visit TFA classrooms and share their knowledge and 
personal insights with students. 
•	Provide Teach For America corps members with FedEx Office discounts 
for print and copy services, lowering their out-of pocket expenses for 
classroom materials. Minority Scholarships and Programs 
FedEx is committed to increasing the number of minority students in the U.S. 
who can go to college and prepare to work in the global economy. We do this 
by providing scholarships and internships for minority students while also 
investing in programs that educate and prepare students and their families 
to apply for college.
FedEx supports minority scholarships with the following organizations:
American Indian College Fund (AICF), Asian & Pacific Islander American 
Scholarship Fund (APIASF), Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), INROADS, the United 
Negro College Fund (UNCF), plus endowment scholarships with the University 
of Mississippi, Jackson State University, and Tennessee State University. 
FedEx supports minority outreach events with various organizations:
•	Hispanic Scholarship Fund Town Hall Meetings , inspirational, bilingual 
sessions where students and their families receive information about  
the value and affordability of a college education. Hispanic Scholarship 
Fund Alumni Hall of Fame Gala , an annual event celebrating the 
accomplishments, contributions, and service of HSF alumni who inspire 
future generations of Latino college graduates on the power of education 
to overcome life’s challenges.
•	The UNCF Empower Me Tour  series, created to motivate middle and 
high school students to prepare for college and pursue academic 
excellence. FedEx also sponsors the UNCF National Alumni Conference , 
designed to provide networking, motivational, and educational workshops 
and events for alumni, college students, college presidents, and UNCF staff.
•	INROADS Southeast Summit inspires interns to be greater and provides 
interns valuable information on career development. INROADS works with 
underserved youth, preparing them for corporate and community leadership.
•	Memphis Challenge Leadership Training  programs for high school 
juniors and seniors.
•	Facing History and Ourselves  programs train teachers how to teach 
diversity in the classroom.
 
VOLUNTEERING AND THE UNITED WAY
FedEx plays an active role in improving life in the communities we serve. 
Thousands of our team members volunteer each year to make our local 
communities better places to live, work, and play.
Our team members support causes in their hometowns every day. Whether 
it’s 150 employees in South Florida participating in a beautification project  
at a local school or two volunteers staffing a clothing drive for Dress for Success 
in Washington, D.C., our team members are actively involved and committed 
to addressing the needs of the communities where they work and live.
The FedEx culture’s passion for volunteerism extends across borders and 
throughout the entire organization. In Korea, for example, volunteers have 2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 8Community & Disaster Relief
FEDEXFAMILYHOUSE
FedEx is the title sponsor and major supporter of FedExFamilyHouse,  
a cost-free “home away from home” for families with children in treatment 
at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis. FedExFamilyHouse, which 
opened in December 2010, is one of the first sustainable, green pediatric 
residence facilities in the U.S., and is Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design (LEED) certified. FedExFamilyHouse supports Le Bonheur’s long-term 
vision to become a top pediatric facility, built upon the concept of medical 
excellence and family-centered care. 
TEAM MEMBER COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
FedEx encourages team members to participate in local-market community 
efforts ranging from volunteer efforts to sponsorships and donations. A sampling 
of our global activities includes:
Helping Children Thrive
•	TEDxKids: Thinkers in education and technology offer students 
hands-on, practical workshops. FedEx sponsored an event in Brussels 
encouraging creative thinking, team building, and problem solving. 
•	More than 70,000 children’s books were collected throughout seven 
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as in South 
Florida, as part of an ongoing commitment to education through the 
annual FedEx Entrega campaign.
•	FedEx employees in various Asia-Pacific markets mentor youths aged 
14–17 during a day of job shadowing, helping students experience  
a work environment at a multinational corporation. FedEx reaffirmed 
its support for young entrepreneurs in Malaysia by sponsoring  
50 students, helping them gain practical understanding of basic 
economics and the business cycle.
•	FedEx supports programs at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Science Center 
that strive to inspire children’s interest in science, technology, 
engineering, and math. FedEx employees volunteer at week-long 
fairs for middle and high school students and on an ongoing basis  
at the Carnegie Science Center where students imagine, design, 
and build cities of the future.
•	FedEx works with Child Rights and You (CRY) to ensure basic 
fundamental rights for children in 40 villages in eastern India. The 
program focuses on healthcare, education, sustainable livelihood 
(community farming), and community mobilization for collective actions 
(watershed program). 
•	FedEx worked with the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh to sponsor  
a playroom in the hospital’s in-patient care department, and to support 
bi-weekly volunteer efforts with the “FedEx Ground Comfort Cart.” 
The Comfort Cart, modeled after a ground delivery van, travels through 
the hospital providing snacks, water, toiletry items, games, and books 
to doctors, patients, and their families. been in the field helping teach children about pedestrian safety while team 
members in Canada have participated in a Tower Climb to benefit local 
organizations. In Germany, our volunteers are involved with Die Tafel Frankfurt, 
a nonprofit organization that collects food from restaurants, supermarkets, 
and bakeries to donate to people in need. And, in Uruguay, one of our team 
members led a project that recruited more than 300 volunteers to deliver 
toys for 700 children. FedEx also champions the creation of a Latin American 
Advisory Council in support of the Center for Excellence in Early Education. 
Together with the United Way, we aim to improve quality early education  
in the region.
Each fall, FedEx team members around the world participate in FedEx Cares 
Week, a volunteer event that benefits local communities and the United Way. 
In FY11, each of 30 cities in the U.S., 4 in our Europe, Middle East, Indian 
Subcontinent and Africa region, 12 in our Asia-Pacific region and 26 in our 
Latin America-Caribbean region hosted a week of service, allowing more 
than 3,400 FedEx team members to volunteer their time. Projects range  
from refurbishing and beautifying local attractions, building playgrounds,  
and painting childcare centers to sorting and organizing food donations  
at local food banks.
ORBIS INTERNATIONAL 
Nearly three-quarters of all cases of blindness in the world could be prevented 
or treated with proper medical care. Through our 29-year involvement with 
ORBIS International, FedEx is proud to have helped deliver the gift of sight  
to the world. ORBIS operates the world’s only Flying Eye Hospital, a DC-10 aircraft 
that contains a teaching facility and ophthalmic surgery center. Volunteer 
pilots from FedEx fly the plane to remote locations across the globe, where 
medical teams perform surgeries, conduct training sessions, and educate 
communities about blindness prevention and treatment. 
FedEx volunteers play key roles throughout the ORBIS program. Last year, 
dozens of FedEx team members helped support Flying Eye Hospital medical 
programs in Peru, the Philippines, and Vietnam. We also provide aircraft 
maintenance and complimentary transportation for critical medical supplies 
headed to ORBIS hospital-based programs around the world.
In 2011, FedEx announced the renewal of a five-year, $5.5 million pledge of 
cash and in-kind support and donated an MD-10 airframe to ORBIS to serve 
as the basis for the next generation Flying Eye Hospital.

We call it the Purple Promise, and it is the credo that our more than 300,000 
team members pledge to uphold. It’s a critical concept for a company that 
serves more than 90 percent of the world’s gross domestic product in  
1 to 3 business days.
This commitment, which guides our actions with customers, has created  
a mindset of service among our people, not only in the experiences they 
create for customers, but also for their fellow team members. From the ways 
we communicate with each other to the level of engagement our people 
consistently show to how we create benefits that ensure we are driving 
employee satisfaction—everything we do is built on fostering and growing 
this service model.
People and Workplace is one of four specific areas where FedEx documents 
progress each year in our Global Citizenship Report. Along with Economics 
and Access, Environment and Efficiency, and Community and Disaster Relief, 
we offer data, information, and examples in our report of how we live up  
to our responsibilities. FedEx team members contribute to our progress  
in these four important areas, their actions speaking just as loudly as the 
numbers that mark our progress.
Our people are the foundation of our success and the key to our future. FedEx 
values the outstanding work of our team members, and we strive to consistently  
provide them with a safe, respectful, and rewarding environment—one where 
our people have opportunities to grow and succeed.
ENGAGEMENT AND TALENT DEVELOPMENT
Creating a culture whose actions reflect the Purple Promise depends on our 
ability to gauge how successfully we are nurturing our relationship with  
our people. We maintain open channels of dialogue so team members can 
tell us what’s working and what isn’t, and we can act on their feedback. 
Ultimately, our success depends on the ability of our people to deliver; 
knowing that, we take responsibility for helping to develop their talents 
so they can succeed.
FEEDBACK AND DIALOGUE
We have built a number of measures to track loyalty, engagement, and 
commitment among our customer-facing work force. The results help us 
identify clear actions we can adopt internally to ensure continued commitment 
and success. One of these tools is the Employee Loyalty Index at FedEx 
Express, which gauges employee satisfaction levels and loyalty. A majority 
of our team members feel a strong loyalty to the company. Strong personal 
job satisfaction, an ability to directly help customers, and the level of respect 
and individual consideration from their managers are cited as top factors 
driving positive relationships with their work and the company.
Employee surveys help us understand their attitudes, preferences, and opinions 
about working at FedEx, including their views of FedEx leadership. Surveys 
also measure engagement and morale among team members. The most 
recently completed surveys had participation rates of 89 percent. The survey WE STRIVE TO MAKE EVERY FEDEX  
EXPERIENCE OUTSTANDING
processes include a “feedback” session with each work group’s management, 
so employees have the opportunity to elaborate on the concerns they 
expressed in the survey.
Many changes and initiatives have resulted from feedback received from 
employees through these processes. This is a longstanding practice for some 
operating companies; the FedEx Express program is in its 34th year. 
TEAM MEMBER ENGAGEMENT AND RETENTION
Across FedEx operating companies, there are many avenues available for team 
members to communicate with management, including town hall-style 
meetings, brown-bag lunches, and skip-level meetings with executives.  
Our “open door” philosophy encourages our team to ask questions, make 
suggestions, or voice their concerns to management.
Engaging our team members and getting their input is crucial to our success. 
All of the FedEx operating companies reported survey participation in FY11. 
The results of feedback sessions result in new ideas and input on work 
processes, as well as solutions to workplace issues.
We work hard to ensure that FedEx is a great place to work. In fact, FedEx 
has been honored as one of the Fortune  “100 Best Companies to Work For”  
in 12 of the past 15 years. FedEx has also consistently ranked in Fortune’s  
“World’s Most Admired Companies” and Fortune’s  “America’s Most Admired 
Companies” lists since 2001.
TEAM MEMBER DEVELOPMENT AND ADVANCEMENT
At FedEx, we believe our success depends on the dedication of our people. 
We have developed recognition programs that celebrate their achievements 
and their commitment to living the values of the company. From the very 
beginning, FedEx has operated on the philosophy of putting people first.  
We have grown to become an industry-leading company with a truly global Team Member Engagement
2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 4People & Workplace
presence by understanding the unique needs of those we serve and by exceeding 
expectations as we meet those needs.
Full-Time U.S. Retention Rate
 
FedEx has a longstanding practice of developing talent from within. We have  
a practice of posting jobs, allowing employees to move up in the ranks  
or transfer from one location to another. FedEx believes the long tenure  
of our team members and excellent industry reputation are both strong 
indicators that our culture is an integral part of our corporate success. In fact, 
more than 80 percent of the managers at FedEx Express have been promoted 
from within.
We place a premium on helping our people pursue their passions and goals 
through internal self-development programs and tuition reimbursement. FedEx 
operating companies allow team members the flexibility of full-time, part-time, 
or independent contractor positions. In fact, in the U.S. alone, FedEx Ground 
contracts with nearly 9,000 incorporated business entities to provide pickup 
and delivery services, as well as a small number of temporary team members 
that we hire primarily on a seasonal basis. Since its founding in 1985, FedEx 
Ground has used an independent contractor business model based on the 
traditional owner-operator model commonly found in the trucking industry. 
Over the years, many of these small-business owners, who are required to be 
incorporated, have built successful operations through their contractual 
relationships with FedEx Ground, and we continue to support their ability to 
create and grow their own businesses. As of May 2012, approximately  
85 percent of FedEx Ground service areas nationwide were supported by 
multiwork area contractors. 
BENEFITS
Our company is committed to providing competitive wages and benefits.  
We are dedicated to delivering programs that foster a supportive work 
environment. Compensation at FedEx is built on three basic principles:  
(1) We ensure the programs are competitive with the external job market 
and align with the long-range financial outlook of the company. (2) The compensation and benefits we offer support a performance-based culture. 
(3) Programs are designed to maximize management flexibility while minimizing 
the resources required to manage programs. FedEx has a history of offering 
comprehensive total compensation packages. Our employee benefits are 
diverse, meeting a variety of needs, including health, retirement, disability, 
and survivor-security plans, as well as an extensive array of work/life and 
other voluntary benefit plans.
HEALTHCARE AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
The notable benefits we highlight below apply to at least 80 percent of the 
work force at FedEx, which is primarily based in the U.S. Because our company 
comprises several different operating companies, each with its own distinct 
structure and employee makeup, different benefits apply to different operating 
companies. We provide our international team members with competitive 
benefit programs, including those that are required under local laws. 
Health insurance is offered to all full-time U.S.-based employees at FedEx 
operating companies. The company and the employee share the cost of the 
health benefit. Part-time employees are eligible for healthcare benefits at 
most FedEx operating companies. Coverage types offered generally include 
medical, dental, prescription drug, mental health/substance abuse, vision, 
and chiropractic care. FedEx offers benefits to same-sex domestic partners 
at all operating companies. 
FedEx encourages financial planning, offering a comprehensive retirement 
plan program that gives eligible U.S.-based employees a solid base on which 
to build a comfortable retirement. A 401(k) plan with matching company 
contributions is offered to eligible employees, and most employees are 
eligible for participation in an employer-funded pension plan. We provide 
tools and resources—such as videos, websites, and webinars—to help our 
employees better understand financial planning, estimate future benefits, 
and develop personal plans for achieving retirement objectives.
QUALITY OF LIFE BENEFITS
FedEx is committed to providing employee programs that promote and encourage 
a supportive work environment while acknowledging the need for a balanced 
personal and professional life. The WorkLife Balance Program, which is 
offered to most U.S.-based employees and their household dependents, helps 
employees manage work and personal responsibilities with free practical 
advice, useful materials, and referrals to local and national resources through 
a toll-free number or via a website. Accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week 
via telephone and online, the benefits offer confidential counseling, free 
educational materials, and unlimited referrals to assist with issues such as 
childcare and parenting, pregnancy and adoption, mothers at work, successful 
aging, health and wellness education, legal and financial issues, daily life 
issues, and relocation services. FedEx also offers resources such as mental 
health and substance-abuse treatment services to individuals in need of these 
types of services in difficult times.

FedEx has a long history of preparing and implementing contingency plans. 
For large-scale disasters, FedEx has established toll-free numbers for affected 
employees to report on their welfare, as well as have questions answered 
and connect with local emergency agencies. Additionally, we support the 
efforts of fellow employees in providing assistance. Disaster relief funds are 
in place at many FedEx operating companies to provide money to employees 
and their families for food, clothing, or shelter in the event that a primary 
residence becomes uninhabitable in the wake of a flood, tornado, fire, or 
other natural disaster.
WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT
At FedEx, we are as diverse as the world we serve; yet we share a common 
belief that our varied backgrounds, skills, and experience combine to create  
a stronger enterprise. We strive for a workplace environment where all  
feel welcome, safe, and supported.
DIVERSITY
We understand how the definitions of “diversity” and “minority” can shift 
depending on cultural context, and we value the contributions and perspectives 
of all team members regardless of race, gender, culture, religion, age, 
nationality, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
or gender expression. The diversity of our work force is essential to our 
continued success in today’s ever-changing global marketplace.
AFFINITY GROUPS
We foster an environment where people can contribute and grow— where 
respect for all persons is a fundamental value and an everyday business 
practice. FedEx Express has a number of affinity groups that exist to promote 
cultural awareness, education, and information. DIVERSITY TRAINING
The values of diversity and inclusion are woven throughout our orientation 
and training programs, from front-line employees to management. Our 
diversity efforts focus on developing a spirit of belonging across our culture. 
In the U.S., diversity training is available for all employees via online, 
interactive, and classroom settings, and is required training for management. 
Classes are designed to help participants learn to recognize differences and 
how they can enhance communication and collaboration in their work group.
COUNCILS AND ALLIANCES
FedEx sponsors a Corporate Diversity Council that focuses on building a global 
culture of diversity and inclusion. The Diversity Council is composed of 
representatives from each FedEx operating company. The Diversity Council 
works to ensure greater employee awareness and positive perception of our 
diversity commitment, and supports multicultural programs within the company 
and the communities we serve. The Diversity Council meets regularly to discuss 
overall strategy and oversee diversity efforts at each FedEx operating 
company. We also support a number of organizations that promote human 
rights and equality, such as the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza. 
Women in the Work Force 
SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
Since its inception in 1992, the FedEx Supplier Diversity program has provided 
avenues for suppliers to access the FedEx supply chain. We are committed 
Minorities in U.S. Management

standards of behavior. Employees who violate the policy are subject to the 
appropriate level of discipline up to and including termination.
In addition to our policies, managers are required to review the definition  
of workplace violence with employees and explain measures that can  
be taken to avoid potentially violent situations. Managers are supplied with 
training materials, such as safety videos, online tutorials, meeting guides, 
and brochures, to help educate employees on the significance of violence 
prevention. Because a safe workplace environment is a priority for FedEx,  
all employees are required to acknowledge they have completed violence 
prevention training.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Our workplace policies are designed to promote a fair environment where  
all team members feel respected, satisfied, and appreciated. We hire, 
evaluate, and promote employees, and retain independent contractors, 
based on their skills and performance. With this in mind, we will not tolerate 
certain behaviors by our employees or independent contractors. These include 
harassment, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind involving 
race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, disability, veteran status, 
sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and, where applicable, 
marital status.
FedEx always seeks to comply with local, state, national, and international 
laws. We articulate our expectations beyond legal compliance in our Code  
of Business Conduct and Ethics and the FedEx Values. Our people across the 
globe are accountable for complying with these policies. The FedEx Code  
of Business Conduct and Ethics sets forth the legal and ethical standards 
with which our people are expected to comply and covers discrimination, 
bribery, corruption, and many other topics. For the FedEx Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics, go to  
investors.fedex.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=73289&p=irol-govconduct . 
The FedEx Values begin with people, because we value our people and 
promote diversity in our workplace and in our thinking. For the full list  
of FedEx Values, go to about.fedex.com/mission-strategy-values .
FedEx has a toll-free 24-hour whistleblower hotline, the FedEx Alert Line, 
established for the anonymous and confidential reporting of any known  
or suspected violation of law, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,  
or any other company policy or any unethical behavior. The Code prohibits 
retaliation for making such reports.
CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
With significant operations throughout both the developed world and emerging 
economies, we understand that our work force will continue to evolve and 
change. We realize that in markets where we currently operate or may operate 
in the future, certain communities are disproportionately impacted by 
catastrophic illnesses such as avian influenza or Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS), and chronic infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS. We are 
committed to the privacy, health, and well-being of our employees, such as to helping suppliers compete for FedEx business fairly and regularly. We contract 
directly with minority-owned, women-owned, and small businesses that are 
competitive in quality, service, and cost.
Supplier Diversity Spending
In addition, we encourage the inclusion of such businesses within the 
subcontracting plans of our entire supplier base. Corporate spending with 
these groups for the 2011 calendar year totaled $3.4 billion, or 24.2 percent  
of total procurement spending.
CREATING A SAFE WORKPLACE
A culture of safety is integral to everything we do. Comprehensive safe 
workplace education is an essential part of our operations’ training programs. 
A global network of safety professionals monitors our compliance with 
regulatory requirements, and works closely with team members on ways  
to avoid injuries and accidents. For the more than 75,000 drivers of FedEx 
vehicles on the road every day, accident prevention is imperative. Newly 
hired FedEx Express couriers must complete 95 hours of in-classroom and 
computer-based training before performing customer pickup-and-delivery 
services. Ramp transport drivers and long-haul drivers must complete  
139 hours of initial defensive-driver training prior to assuming the full-time 
responsibilities of the position. We also conduct exhaustive investigations  
to determine the root causes of accidents so that unsafe acts can be  
reduced or prevented.
The FedEx Express safety program, Safety Above All, has driven a nearly  
56 percent reduction in vehicle accidents and employee injuries over the past  
16 years. We are passionate about recognizing and rewarding our team members 
who consistently demonstrate safe practices. FedEx drivers are recognized 
for outstanding driving records through safety milestone awards, which are 
earned after driving accident-free for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 years.
VIOLENCE PREVENTION
Workplace violence prevention is an important part of ensuring that working 
conditions remain safe for our team members. Each operating company 
maintains a strict policy regarding workplace violence and acceptable 
2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 7People & Workplace
through providing educational information regarding these illnesses and 
diseases whenever possible and continuously evaluating our role in both health 
education and care. As an example, we have established a corporate-level 
team that—through close contact with leading health organizations and medical 
experts—monitors acute outbreaks of infectious diseases around the world. 
The team is responsible for developing and updating our pandemic contingency 
plans. These plans provide for, among other things, regular communication 
of the latest medical advice to our work force and operational adjustments 
to ensure continuing high levels of service to our customers when faced 
with such events. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW
We are committed to furthering our longstanding adherence to the highest 
standards of corporate governance. FedEx has an independent Board of Directors 
committed to the highest quality corporate governance. Reflecting this 
commitment, we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform 
rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth  
in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the New York Stock Exchange’s 
corporate governance listing standards.
We have implemented many governance enhancements that go well beyond 
those legal requirements. For example, in 2011, our Board of Directors and 
stockholders approved the addition of a stockholder special meeting right. 
In addition, within the past few years, we have: 
•	Added a number of highly qualified, independent directors to the Board, 
including: R. Brad Martin, the former CEO of Saks Incorporated; Joshua 
Cooper Ramo, Vice Chairman of Kissinger Associates, Inc.; Susan C. Schwab, 
Professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy; and 
David P. Steiner, the CEO of Waste Management, Inc.
•	Eliminated the classified structure of the Board to allow for the annual 
election of all directors.
•	Amended our charter and bylaws to eliminate all super-majority shareholder 
voting requirements.
•	Adopted a policy requiring stockholder approval for any future “poison pill” 
prior to or within 12 months after adoption of the poison pill.
•	Adopted a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections 
and a resignation requirement for directors who fail to receive the required 
majority vote. The Board is prohibited from changing back to a plurality-
voting standard without the approval of our stockholders.
•	Adopted a lead independent director corporate governance structure for 
our Board of Directors.
 
In addition, compliance with the reporting requirements of Section 404 of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act is one of our highest priorities, and we have leveraged 
this effort to further improve our already rigorous disclosure controls and 
procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting.DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
The Board’s standards for determining director independence, which are 
included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, are more stringent than 
applicable legal requirements, and all but one of our 12 directors qualify  
as independent under these standards. Under the Board’s standards of 
director independence, a director will be considered independent only if  
the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no direct or indirect 
material relationship with FedEx, other than as a director.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
The Board of Directors has adopted a Policy on Review and Preapproval  
of Related Person Transactions, which is included in our Corporate Governance 
Guidelines. The policy requires that all proposed related person transactions 
(as defined in the policy) and all proposed material changes to existing 
related person transactions be reviewed and preapproved by the Nominating 
& Governance Committee. To the extent the related person (as defined in the 
policy) is a director or immediate family member of a director, the transaction 
or change must also be reviewed and preapproved by the full Board. The policy 
provides that a related person transaction or a material change to an existing 
related person transaction may not be preapproved if it would:
•	Interfere with the objectivity and independence of any related person’s 
judgment or conduct in carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities 
to FedEx;
•	Not be fair as to FedEx; or 
•	Otherwise be opposed to the best interests of FedEx and  
its stockholders. 
 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH DIRECTORS
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate directly with 
any member or committee of the Board of Directors by writing to:
FedEx Corporation Board of Directors
c/o Corporate Secretary
942 South Shady Grove Road
Memphis, TN 38120
The Corporate Secretary of FedEx will review all such correspondence and 
regularly forward to the Board a summary of all such correspondence and 
copies of all correspondence that, in her opinion, deals with the functions  
of the Board or its committees or that she otherwise determines requires the 
attention of any member, group, or committee of the Board of Directors.2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 8People & Workplace
NOMINATION OF DIRECTOR CANDIDATES
The Nominating & Governance Committee will consider director nominees 
proposed by stockholders. To recommend a prospective director candidate 
for the Nominating & Governance Committee’s consideration, stockholders 
may submit the candidate’s name, qualifications, including whether the 
candidate satisfies the requirements set forth in our annual proxy statement, 
and other relevant biographical information in writing to:
FedEx Corporation Nominating & Governance Committee
c/o Corporate Secretary
942 South Shady Grove Road
Memphis, TN 38120
The FedEx Corporation Bylaws require stockholders to give advance notice  
of stockholder proposals, including nominations of director candidates.
The Board is responsible for recommending director candidates for election 
by the stockholders and for electing directors to fill vacancies or newly 
created directorships. The Board has delegated the screening and evaluation 
process for director candidates to the Nominating & Governance Committee, 
which identifies, evaluates, and recruits highly qualified director candidates 
and recommends them to the Board. The Nominating & Governance Committee 
considers potential candidates for director, who may come to the attention  
of the Nominating & Governance Committee through current directors, 
management, professional search firms, stockholders, or other persons. The 
Nominating & Governance Committee has engaged a third-party executive 
search firm to assist in identifying potential Board candidates. The Nominating 
& Governance Committee considers and evaluates a director candidate 
recommended by a stockholder in the same manner as a nominee recommended 
by a Board member, management, or other sources. A director must retire 
immediately before the annual meeting of our stockholders during the calendar 
year in which he or she attains age 72.
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF NONMANAGEMENT DIRECTORS
Nonmanagement Board members meet without management present at 
regularly scheduled executive sessions in conjunction with each in-person 
meeting of the Board of Directors. At least once a year, such meetings include 
only the independent members of the Board. The Lead Independent Director 
presides over these meetings of the nonemployee and independent directors 
and may call such meetings as he or she deems necessary or appropriate.
COMBINED CHAIRMAN AND CEO ROLES
Our Board of Directors believes that FedEx and its stockholders have been 
and continue to be well-served by having Frederick W. Smith, our founder, 
serve as both Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
Under Mr. Smith’s leadership, FedEx has become one of the most trusted  
and respected brands in the world and has experienced strong long-term 
financial growth and stockholder return. Separating the Chairman and CEO roles is not necessary to ensure that our Board provides independent and 
effective oversight of our business and affairs. Such oversight is maintained 
at FedEx through the composition of our Board, the strong leadership of our 
independent directors, Board committees and Lead Independent Director, 
and our highly effective corporate governance structures and processes 
already in place.
COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS
FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world.  
We have a longstanding commitment to complying with the law wherever  
we operate and striving to maintain a high standard of business and personal 
ethics. FedEx has long fostered a culture in which integrity and ethical 
conduct are recognized, valued, and exhibited by our employees and independent 
contractors. We developed two important tools to help our employees and 
independent contractors understand and maintain our high standard of 
business and personal ethics: the FedEx Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics; and the FedEx Alert Line, our company-wide whistleblower hotline.
The Code, which is available to all employees and independent contractors 
through our company intranet and our Investor Relations website, sets forth 
the legal, ethical, and professional standards with which our employees  
and independent contractors are expected to comply. Employees can review 
the Code in multiple foreign languages on the intranet.
The Code requires our employees and independent contractors to report 
immediately any suspected violation of those standards, and the Alert Line 
provides one mechanism for doing so. Using the Alert Line, employees and 
independent contractors are able to make anonymous, confidential reports, 
24 hours a day, of suspected legal and ethical violations within FedEx by 
making a toll-free phone call. The Code prohibits retaliation for making 
such a report.
We promote the Code and Alert Line to FedEx employees and independent 
contractors through a variety of means, which include various operating 
company-level communications, as well as framing and hanging our 12” x 18” 
Alert Line poster—translated into the appropriate local language—in  
a permanent, conspicuous spot at all FedEx locations.
In our annual code of conduct questionnaire, each senior manager and above 
must certify, among other things, that he or she has:
•	Discussed the FedEx Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and FedEx 
Alert Line with all his or her direct reports; and
•	Exercised appropriate supervision and oversight to ensure compliance 
with the Code within the area of his or her responsibility. 
In addition, the Code expressly imposes on officers, directors, and senior 
managers the additional responsibility of promoting the principles set forth 
in the Code and fostering a culture in which ethical conduct is recognized, 
valued, and exhibited by all employees.2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 9People & Workplace
We also provide appropriate training to our employees on a wide range  
of compliance and ethics topics.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY
Our executive compensation philosophy is to: (1) closely align the compensation 
paid to our executives with the performance of the company on both  
a short-term and long-term basis, and (2) set performance goals that do not 
promote excessive risk while supporting the company’s core long-term 
financial goals. We design our executive compensation program to further our 
mission of producing superior financial returns for our shareowners by pursuing 
the following objectives:
•	Retaining and attracting highly qualified and effective executive officers 
by paying them competitively; 
•	Motivating executive officers to contribute to our future success and  
to build long-term shareowner value and rewarding them accordingly  
by linking a significant part of their compensation to our financial and 
stock price performance, especially long-term performance; and
•	Further aligning executive officer and shareowner interests by encouraging 
and facilitating long-term shareowner returns and significant ownership 
of FedEx stock by executives.
We believe that there should be a strong relationship between pay and 
corporate performance (both financial results and stock price), and our 
executive compensation program reflects this belief. In particular, annual  
and long-term incentive compensation payments and stock options represent  
a significant portion of our executive compensation program, and this variable 
compensation is “at risk” and directly dependent upon the achievement  
of preestablished corporate goals or stock price appreciation.
STOCK OWNERSHIP GOAL FOR DIRECTORS AND SENIOR OFFICERS
In order to encourage significant stock ownership by our directors and 
senior officers, and to further align their interests with the interests of our 
stockholders, the Board of Directors has established a goal that:
•	Within three years after joining the Board, each nonmanagement director 
own FedEx shares valued at three times his or her annual retainer fee; and
•	Within four years after being appointed to his or her position, each 
member of senior management own FedEx shares valued at a multiple 
(that varies by position) of his or her annual base salary.
Each FedEx director (other than Mr. Ramo, who joined the Board in 2011) and 
executive officer owns sufficient shares to comply with this goal.
ANNUAL REVIEW
We review all aspects of our governance policies and practices (including our 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board committee charters, and Code  
of Business Conduct and Ethics) with the Board at least annually in light of best 
practices and make whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding 
commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information about our corporate governance, including copies  
of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board committee charters, and Code 
of Business Conduct and Ethics, can be found at investors.fedex.com .
STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE SYSTEMS
We encourage our shareowners and other stakeholders to communicate their 
views with management by contacting us at ir@fedex.com.
Similarly, for our team members, we have an Open Door Policy whereby each 
operating company encourages both formal and informal dialogue. Although 
specific feedback systems take different forms depending on the operating 
company, team members everywhere can provide honest feedback without 
fear of retribution.
FedEx firmly believes in maintaining a work environment that is inclusive and 
engaging. Accordingly, we rely on our team members to maintain our positive 
culture. As a result, we have developed policies and systems to ensure our 
team has every opportunity to elevate their issues of concern. 
Employee feedback systems range from annual employee opinion surveys  
in all operating companies around the world to the FedEx Alert Line. We take 
the opinions of our entire team very seriously, and the FedEx Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics expressly prohibits intimidation or retribution for reports 
of misconduct made in good faith.2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP GOALS & PROGRESS UPDATE  | 10People & Workplace
AWARDS AND RECOGNITION
In 2012, FedEx was included in the Glassdoor Top 50 Best Places to Work
