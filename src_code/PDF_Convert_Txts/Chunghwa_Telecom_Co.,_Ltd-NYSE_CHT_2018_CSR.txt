The Creation of
Sustainable 
Value 524In this 12th edition of our Corporate Social Responsibility Report, you shall see Chunghwa Telecom’s company 
tagline “Always Ahead” embodied in our devotion to corporate governance, environmental protection, and social 
responsibility. We’ve also actively sought to connect with the world through our endeavors toward achieving the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and utilizing our advantages in corporate capabilities, 
resources, and information & communications technology (ICT). Through this report, we hope to help the related 
industries in Taiwan achieve the SDGs and create more sources of positive influence in society.
Through the joint efforts of all our employees, Chunghwa Telecom has achieved excellence in sustainability in 2018, 
becoming the first  Taiwanese telecom company among our competitors to join the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 
Supply Chain Program. We have also incorporated the ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement Standard to drive supply 
chain sustainability and implement a sustainability rating system. As the  first  Taiwanese telecom company to have 
signed on as a supporter of the initiative led by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we 
shall remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability.
Chunghwa Telecom utilizes its advantage in bandwidth, coverage, and number of cell towers to garner customer loyalty 
in the highly-competitive telecom market. As such, the Company maintains a firm foothold as the leader in the mobile, 
broadband network, and streaming television markets through successful customer retention and development. 
Chunghwa Telecom has achieved outstanding results in the past year, with our streaming television service MOD passing 
2 million subscribers, our mobile network named Taiwan’s Speedtest Award’s winner, and continuing to hold the 
OpenSignal State of Mobile Networks Report title for 4G Download Speed and Overall Download Speed, thus maximizing 
profit for our shareholders.
In addition to our gradual implementation of sustainability measures, Chunghwa Telecom has actively followed the UN 
SDGs. The Company has utilized our collective core competencies as a telecom company in five important aspects: The 
Digital Economy Motivator, The Creative Industry Pilot, The Happiness Value Protector, the Green Corporation Pioneer, 
and the Social Value Guide. We are actively pursuing our goals to realize a digitally inclusive society and sustainable 
development in the hope of driving the cycle of sustainable development in the telecom industry.
Chunghwa Telecom is responding to the government’s “5+2” Industrial Innovation Plan for green energy with actual 
actions, actively promoting the use of renewable energy. Our solar panel system tops the industry in total capacity, no 
matter for our own use or agent constructions. The former were issued with 97 Taiwan Renewable Energy Certificate 
(T-REC) by the Bureau of Standards; the latter includes the Zhangbin Solar Power Plant, the country’s largest solar power 
plant with a total capacity of 100 MW and an annual output of 130 million  kWh, rivaling the carbon absorption capability 
of 180  Daan Forest Parks. We are making substantial contributions to the development of renewable energy in Taiwan.
In the face of the global major economic risk posed by climate change, Chunghwa Telecom strives towards its ultimate 
goal of becoming a green enterprise. We have taken various sustainable measures in 2018: (1) introducing  the ISO 
20400 Sustainable Procurement Standard, (2) collaborating with our supply chain to participate in the CDP by utilizing 
of corporate influence, (3) establishing a four-tier rating system (Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Participation) for sustainable 
products and services, and (4) incorporating a sustainable partner evaluation mechanism, making us the first  Taiwanese 
telecom company to implement a sustainable partner certification system. We also plan to apply for the Science-Based 
Targets (SBT) to fully implement carbon management in our supply chain, ensuring mutually beneficial partnerships that 
drive us to a low carbon future and sustainability in the ICT industry chain. 
With regards to social integration, Chunghwa Telecom aspires to realize its vision of bridging the digital divide and 
creating digital opportunities. We adopted the “5I SDGs” initiatives via collaboration with nonprofit/non-governmental 
organizations, implementation of corporate volunteering and utilization of our core competencies. Through these 
initiatives, we support diverse groups and implement our core beliefs in regions facing a shortage of resources, and have 
thus achieved a mutually beneficial relationship between digital rights and innovative economy. We have continued 
to provide educational resources to 12 rural regions including Matsu, Lanyu, Taitung, Hualien, Kaohsiung, and Tainan. 
These efforts have minimized the transportation risks for underprivileged schoolchildren by providing community 
access to online after-school tutoring services given by university students of the Fu Jen Catholic University’s Center 
of Care Services for Rural Area Education in Taiwan. By bringing individuals together, everyone, both young and old, 
are able to prosper. We have been committed to our “Read with You” community network tutoring service for  10 years, 
bringing together 4,035  university students and 2,577 rural schoolchildren in a one-on-one tutoring service totaling 
83,696 hours. This allows college students to experience personal growth and learn that “it is more blessed to give than 
to receive,” while helping rural schoolchildren to get ahead in life around through the positive influence provided by 
college students. A total of 85 “Digital Good Neighbors” were also established to deliver resources across the country, 
including offshore islands. Furthermore, our 10 year-long commitment to “Click Taiwan” has guided  500 university and 
college students from 80 departments of 40 schools into  73 rural communities, producing over 300 videos to record the 
stories of the local people, preserve local cultures, and provide marketing assistance to local industries.Message from the Chairman

Industry Value Chain and Critical Sustainability Performance
Due to technological advancements, boundaries of specialized markets that we used to know of are starting 
to shift, thus allowing industry participants to compete outside of their dominant markets. International Data 
Corporation has even combined ICT , e-Commerce, Electronics and Entertainment into a new segment called 
eICT to recognize the increasingly common cross-industry collaboration.
The wave of digital convergence brings new values to the telecom industry and opportunities to meet users’ 
needs by offering innovative eICT services, which makes content providers and integrators, application service 
providers, network equipment suppliers and terminal equipment suppliers the important value partners to a 
telecom carrier in the development of digital convergence services.

Corporate Governance
Chunghwa Telecom Board of Directors is the highest governing body. The Board of Directors is responsible 
for appointing and nominating high-level managers, as well as formulating and reviewing corporate social 
responsibility, and sustainable development strategies. The 9th Board has 13 directors. To date, there 
are 2 women and 11 men, including 4 independent male directors and 1 female independent director. 
Directors ’tenure is three years (June 21, 2019 to June 20, 2022). All of the independent directors are included 
in the Audit Committee to ensure the independence of governance and the perspectives of the stakeholders. 
Chunghwa Telecom ’s independent directors and outside directors provide expertise based on their respective 
areas of practice and professionalism to assist the Board of Directors in making decisions as to benefit the 
company and the shareholders. To prevent personal liability and financial losses due to third-party litigation, 
we have purchased indemnity insurance for Directors.
Chunghwa Telecom values diversity in Board of Directors and recruits talents primarily based on skill 
sets. Selection of directors is not limited to any particular gender, nationality or ethnicity. Directors are 
expected to have outstanding quality, industry experience and expertise to complement the board.
Board Diversity Policy
All Chunghwa Telecom directors are nominated by the Board of Directors and shareholders holding the 
legally required percentage of shares, they are then subsequently appointed by the Board of Directors. 
The compensation committee has implemented a soft incorporation of sustainable development 
strategies and targets into its review of director compensation in accordance with the Company ’s 
Articles of Incorporation so as to achieve the following: (1) evaluation of required core competencies 
in order to facilitate the connection between director performance and the Company ’s sustainability 
outlook and short-, medium, and long-term strategies and targets, (2) strengthening accountability and 
linking performance with compensation, recruitment and retention to attract key talent on the Board 
of Directors. The implementation of this measure coupled with the substantial effect of the variable 
compensation plan is a win-win for the Company and its directors.Linking Director Compensation to Sustainability Performance

15Avoidance of Conflict of Interest
Encourage Shareholders to Participate in Corporate GovernanceChunghwa Telecom ’s Chairman is concurrently the CEO. The elections of directors comply with relevant 
laws and regulations, which suggest the Board and shareholders with qualified shareholding ratio nominate 
the candidates, and director ’s nomination and review are conducted accordingly. In order to avoid conflicts 
of interest in the highest governance bodies, we conduct strict controls in accordance with the following 
procedures, including: 
• All the new directors shall sign the Consent to Appointment to announce that they will follow Section 23 of 
the Company Act, conduct faithful business and perform the duty of care as a bona fide manager.
• All directors have to sign the Statement to show that they clearly knew the content of Section 206 of the 
Company Act, which is about the content of avoidance of voting rights and the legal effect of violations.
Due to the directors ’ high ethical standards and self-disciple, in the operation of the mechanism, no conflict 
of interest has occurred since the Board of Directors was established. Moreover, the Board has resolved 
to approve a total of 50 articles of “Code of Corporate Governance for Chunghwa Telecom,” while all 
departments are required to implement the Code of Conduct, and the secretariat also evaluates on a regular 
basis.
Chunghwa Telecom has made changes and revisions to several systems and measures based on a corporate 
governance mindset. These include e-voting, voting by poll and the disclosure of meeting resolutions made on 
the Company official website. These diverse voting channels allow shareholders to exercise their rights easily 
and this has made corporate governance more effective.

In 2018, Chunghwa Telecom income tax was the equivalent of an effective tax rate of 18.95 %. The deviation 
from statutory 20% tax rate was mainly attributed to the provisions of Article 4 of Income Tax Act, in that 
net dividends or net earnings recognized from local invested businesses are exempt from income tax. The 
application can be made for tax preference pursuant to Article 10 of the Statute for Industrial Innovation.

17Highest Moral Standard
We have set up the “Code of Ethics of Chunghwa Telecom Co Ltd,” “Ethical Corporate Management Best 
Practice Principle,” and “Procedures for Ethical Management and Guidelines for Conduct.” These are 
formulated as basic ethical guidelines to ensure that all employees engage in all activities with the highest 
standard. In addition to these codes being included in the training program for new hires, all employees are 
required to log into the web, review the material and take a test annually. All employees participated in the 
test in 2018 except for those who were not available for a legitimate reason at the time of the test.
Chunghwa Telecom has prepared the “Employee Appraisal Guidelines” and “Employee Reward/Disciplinary 
Standards” for the evaluation of performance. Rewards and sanctions are applied according to these rules 
whenever employees exhibit conduct deserving of them. Information such as a grievance hotline has been 
made available on the Chunghwa Telecom intranet/employee portal. A total of 52 internal complaint cases 
(disciplinary and leak investigations) were accepted in 2018, 50 of which are closed and 2 of which are still 
under investigation; 14 were associated with violation of the code of conduct. All complaints were investigated 
and handled according to company internal policies and principles, and taught as case studies to strengthen 
employee esteem for the rules, discipline, corporate image, and shareholders ’ interests.
The corporate governance of Chunghwa Telecom places great emphasis 
on integrity, accountability, and trustworthiness. We are committed 
to reducing information asymmetry between the management and 
external stakeholders, and utilize a variety of means such as the corporate

Creating Sustainable Value
Our CSR issues and actions have created sound economic, environmental and social value. Although we 
have made serious efforts to adapt quantized data when setting-up and managing CSR plans, targets and 
performance, we have come to realize the difficulty of quantizing environmental and social values. There is 
still lots of true value that cannot be realized with the currency presently used as evaluation indicators of CSR 
performance.

We have used a “True Value” method of calculation. Positive (+) and negative (-) currency values have been 
assigned in an assessment of our influence on society and the environment. This gives a sound idea of the real 
environmental and social value (profit and cost) of our sustainability efforts in 2018. The economic, social and 
environmental currency value CHT created on operation has also been blended in.

We have always thought that “Chunghwa Telecom can do more.” As the leading brand in the telecom industry 
in Taiwan, CHT focuses on industry development and competition. In addition to good products, services 
and profits, we also give back to society. We also pay close attention to the voices of our internal and external 
stakeholders before making careful responses to the needs of society.
The identification of the stakeholders and their issues is a very important part of the practice of CSR. We have 
established a stakeholder identification and engagement process in accordance with AA 1000SES (2015), 
interacting and communicating with stakeholders through diverse channels.
In the initial meeting of CSR report preparation, we invite members from all departments to exchange the 
issues related to current key stakeholders and their concerns. Upon reaching mutual understanding, the result 
is incorporated into a table that is regarded as an essential reference for the disclosures in the report. In the 
process of promoting CSR activities and information disclosure, we consult the opinion of the internal and 
external stakeholders, important relevant mechanisms include:
• “Consultation meeting with external professionals” for CSR report
• Regular invitation of external professionals to the “CSR Conference” and relevant forums
• The “CSR Supplier Conference” is held every year
• CHT was the first to create “CSR videos” and the CHT official YouTube CSR program to record the 
implementation of CSR action on a regular basis, as well as the collection of internal and external feedback 
for further improvement.

37The 2018 Annual CSR Supplier Conference
The 2018 Annual CSR Service Provider Convention was hosted by CHT’s President Chi-Mau Sheih. At the convention, we 
formally introduced the Sustainable Procurement Standard (ISO 20400) to our procurement process. By establishing 
a “green supply chain” and evaluating suppliers based on sustainability, we are one step closer to achieving our 
sustainable goals in environmental protection, corporate governance, labor rights, and occupational health & safety.
CHT announced its participation in the Global Carbon Disclosure Project back in 2017. We were the first telecom company 
in Taiwan to do so, marking a milestone in sustainable value creation. Beginning in 2018, we went a step further and 
started to encourage our suppliers to fully disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and devise plans to reduce carbon 
footprint. The first “CDP Newcomer Award” was given to AcBel Polytech Inc. to applaud its efforts in carbon disclosure. 
Four other suppliers—SYSAGE Technology, Ta Ya Electric Wire & Cable, Hua Eng Wire & Cable, and Nokia Taiwan—were 
also commended for their efforts in performing “CSR second party audit” and “online information disclosure.”
The 2018 convention also included two keynote speeches. Prof. Hsin-Yu Shan from National Chiao Tung University 
discussed the importance of “Corporate Disaster Prevention”—establishing a corporate disaster management system 
based on forward-looking risk assessment to strengthen internal resilience to climate changes.  Dr. Tony Mo, the Deputy 
Secretary General of BCSD-Taiwan, addressed the emerging trend of “circular economy”—businesses can create “green 
opportunities” through innovation and resource integration, pioneering a unique path towards sustainable development.
The convention concluded with a promise by Ming-Fang Li, the Deputy Manager of Procurement, that further 
actions shall be taken to improve suppliers’ sustainability. Through the practical implementation of second party 
sustainability audits, we encourage our suppliers to strike a balance between economic benefits, environmental 
protection, and social welfare. We hope that CHT , together with its suppliers, can build a sustainable supply chain 
system from which all parties involved can benefit.

Our “ Risk Management Committee ” adopts Enterprise Risk Management  (ERM ) 
software and the “ Risk Analysis Matrix ” as our assessment tools, governing every 
business decision made by our employees.
The development of the Artificial Intelligence of Things  (AIoT ) will popularize 
edge computing, IoT phone numbers, drones, AR, VR, and smart homes. These 
emerging industries will propel the development of hardware and operating 
systems.
CHT is the first  telecom company in Taiwan to sign the support statement 
issued by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD ).
Adopting a risk-based approach, CHT established the“ Chunghwa Telecom 
Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection Framework .” Based on NIST ’s Cybersecurity 
Framework (CSF) and domestic and international standards and regulations, the 
framework includes five steps: identify, protect, detect, respond, and improve.CHT promises that it will submit its Science Based Targets  (SBT ) on carbon 
reduction for review within the next 2 years.
CHT is actively looking into the development of renewable energy. We have 
the largest capacity, self-built or otherwise, for solar energy among all telecom 
companies in Taiwan.
CHT places emphasis on the control of the corporate operation and sustainability risk. In 2016, 
the Company established a Risk Management Committee with the President as convener and 
high rank managers as members. The committee supervises risk management throughout 
the organization and is responsible for prioritizing identified risks, formulating response 
strategies to key risk issues, and reporting to the board of directors when deemed necessary. 
Through control of the mechanism at each level, potential risks and loss to the Company can 
be minimized.40

Identifying and analyzing climate related risks are important responsibilities of CHT ’s “Risk Management 
Committee.” Led by CHT ’s President in conjunction with committee members, the committee takes charge 
of risk management. Issues are prioritized based on the types of risks and urgency involved. Apart from 
formulating an action plan, climate-related issues are reported to the Board of Directors.
CHT ’s Environmental Sustainability Task Force systematically reviews climate change-related issues that could 
potentially impact day-to-day business operations and comes up with countermeasures based on its “Five 
Year Plan of Sustainable Development Strategies and Goals.”
The review process includes a scenario analysis of physical and transitional risks and how they could affect 
major business operations. It also evaluates the effectiveness of energy-saving practices and the adaptability 
of equipment, ensuring normal operation even in extreme weather conditions. The potentiality of natural 
disasters is considered in the construction of telecom equipment. In other words, we assess the risks of 
earthquakes, tsunamis, geological instability, and other weather-related risks to ensure our equipment 
operates correctly and to ensure the safety of our employees in the event of a natural disaster.
CHT ’s CSR Environmental Sustainability Task Force keeps track of climate change on a regular basis and 
submits a yearly assessment report to the Risk Management Committee, which, if necessary, takes measures 
to mitigate the level of risks.
Based on the task force ’s feedback, the Risk Management Committee will seek ways to improve the existing 
risk management model to ensure that the process is consistent with our business goals. Finally, the Chief 
Audit Executive, who performs the final review, reports the assessment results to the Board of Directors. Our 
goal is to incorporate climate change-related risks into our existing internal risk management framework.Identifying and Analyzing Climate Change Related Risks

advantages within the industry, stakeholder concerns, and impact the Company’s image and reputation.Impacts of Climate-related Risks on Chunghwa Telecom
1. The rising global temperature and intensifying extreme weather due to enhanced greenhouse effect 
have led to the threat of severe typhoons and flooding; the industrial and residential water usage in 
certain regions have also been affected by water shortage crises. Therefore, more resources need to 
be invested in natural disaster prevention, post-disaster facility maintenance, and operational energy 
access.
2. The government ’s implementation of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act shall 
result in the enforcement of greenhouse gas emission control and the liberalization of carbon rights 
& carbon emission trading. The corresponding increases to our operational costs, due to Chunghwa 
Telecom ’s significant reliance on energy in the maintenance of networks and computer facilities, will 
undoubtedly impact our finances.Potential Climate-related Risks on CHT’s Operations
Opportunities and Strategies
Chunghwa Telecom adopts a two-pronged strategy which is dedicated to the pursuit of a low-carbon 
transition and taking advantage of future business opportunities both internally and externally.
Chunghwa Telecom has utilized its long-established experience in the development of information & 
communication systems and environmental monitoring systems for electrical environments to integrate and 
monitor our clients’ energy-consuming equipment inside their buildings. We ’ve also adopted a cloud platform 
to provide clients with services such as energy-saving performance calculations, equipment operational status 
monitoring, and real-time notifications. These services help businesses lower carbon reduction threshold and 
reach their energy-saving and carbon reduction targets.
As for our development of renewable energy, Chunghwa Telecom has invested thousands of manpower to 
build the Changhua Coastal Solar Power Plant. This plant is the country’s  largest  solar power plant, with 
a total capacity of 100 MW and an annual output of 130 million  kWh. The power plant reduces annual CO 2 
emissions by 70,000  metric tons, creating revenues for the Company and thus is a mutually beneficial 
endeavor benefitting both the environment and our operations.47

In order to adapt to the potential changes in the environmental and climate change regulations & 
international accords, we have developed the following strategy:Carbon Reduction Practices and Measures
In addition to mitigating the environmental impact caused by our operations, products, and 
services, we have reduced our carbon footprint via green innovative services and revolutionary 
technologies such as video conference, digital receipt services, and cloud products. We’ve also 
utilized the technological advantage in our primary businesses to help build smart cities; an 
example of such low-carbon solutions is a smart taxi dispatch system that lowers the number of 
empty cabs on the road and reduces fuel consumption.
Development of Low-Carbon Products and ServicesIn 2017, we crossed into the solar photovoltaic field with the establishment of smart energy offices 
and office buildings, along with the development of Green ICT . By the end of 2018, Chunghwa 
Telecom had topped the industry  in the energy capacity of solar photovoltaic facilities, including 
those installed in our own facilities and those commissioned by other businesses. We have also 
installed solar panels on cell towers in remote mountainous areas to reduce energy consumption 
and carbon emission; these panels can also provide power to the cell towers in the case of a power 
outage to support emergency communications.
Development of Renewable Energy
In 2017, Chunghwa Telecom joined the CDP Supply Chain Program and became the first telecom 
company in Taiwan to participate in CDP’s international platform. The official implementation of our 
carbon management measures with our 100 suppliers prompted them to disclose complete greenhouse 
gas information in a positive and proactive manner and commence planning of carbon management 
measures and strategies.
We incorporated the ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement Standard in 2018 to implement our 
sustainable development beliefs in procurement practices, allowing us to evaluate our suppliers 
and establish graded management of a green supply chain. These measures helped us achieve our 
sustainable development goals in environmental protection, corporate management, labor rights, and 
health & safety.
Establishment of a Sustainable, Low-Carbon Supply ChainEstablishment of the “Five-year Plan of Strategy and Goal for Environmental Sustainability 
Development” through active engagement with the competent authorities, related organizations, 
and other stakeholders to expand environmental protection efforts through the pursuit of “green 
corporation,” “green sustainability,” and “green innovation” goals. We’ve also implemented 
hazard mitigation measures for computer facilities and climate adaptation plans to strengthen 
emergency response measures and reduce climate risks.
Close Observation of Regulatory Changes both Domestically and Abroad
In 2017, we have a wide range of service centers across Taiwan, linking environmental protection 
and online services to a green store. Chunghwa Telecom is the first  company in Taiwan to 
incorporate green stores in its employee convenience stores. To further plan for the promotion 
of environmental sustainability, in 2019 we plan to implement the management of the service 
centers’ carbon footprints. The program shall be assessed for its conformance to ISO 14067 and 
submitted for review to attain the Environmental Protection Administration Carbon Footprint 
Label, making Chunghwa Telecom the first  telecom company in Taiwan to acquire the label. This 
shall be beneficial for “green communication” between the customers and ourselves.

Chunghwa Telecom first introduced the concept of carbon pricing management in 2018 to enable stress 
testing from a risk management perspective. In 2019, we established the stress testing scenario evaluating 
voluntary carbon reduction targets. Although the current greenhouse gas emission reduction and 
management methodology has yet to establish the telecom industry ’s total greenhouse gas emissions, we at 
Chunghwa Telecom continue to follow our voluntary medium- and long-term carbon reduction targets, which 
serve as the basis for the calculation of internal carbon pricing and the evaluation of internal energy-saving 
and carbon reduction projects.Internal Carbon Pricing

Carbon management scenarios are based on voluntary medium- and long-term carbon emission reduction 
targets. With 2017 as the base year, the carbon emission reduction of the Company’s buildings should 
accumulate to a total of 10% by 2023. In other words, Chunghwa Telecom should reach an accumulated 
greenhouse gas emission reduction of 83,298.75 t-CO 2e in its buildings by 2023.
The numbers in the parentheses signify a decrease in carbon emissions compared to 2017; therefore, no

The total greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 were 834,513.3 t-CO 2e, consisting of six types of greenhouse 
gases, namely, CO 2, CH 4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF 6.
As the operations of Chunghwa Telecom primarily use electrical power, the greenhouse gas is mainly scope 2 
emissions (purchased electricity), accounting for a percentage of 96.35 %. Scope 1 emissions, which account 
for 3.65 %, are mostly generated by workplace emission sources. Closer investigation of the 2018 statistics 
reveals that although electricity consumption decreased, there was a slight increase in total carbon emissions 
due to the increase in national carbon emission factor.
To facilitate the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions, Chunghwa Telecom has actively built solar 
photovoltaic systems in recent years, reducing carbon emissions by 53,738  kg-CO 2e; we also acquired 97 
Taiwan Renewable Energy Certificates (T-REC) in 2018.Greenhouse Gas Emissions Management

StrategiesTo ensure the security of our “critical infrastructure” and “critical information infrastructure,” we established the 
“Chunghwa Telecom Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection Framework.” Based on the guidelines found in NIST’s 
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and domestic and international standards and regulations, the framework helps us 
evaluate our performance in cybersecurity management.
We have established a department dedicated to cybersecurity. It is responsible for coordinating cybersecurity 
strategies, formulating and revising regulations, and the centralized monitoring of information infrastructure 
security. Furthermore, we update our annual action plans and performance indicators based on external 
environment and internal risk assessments to reduce cybersecurity risks. These performance indicators are 
applicable in every employee’s performance review.
The Risk Management Committee keeps track of the risk monitoring process of cybersecurity and personal 
information protection. Any material risks identified will be reported to the audit committee of the Board of 
Directors, or in severe cases, directly to the Board of Directors. In 2018, there were no incidents of material risks 
arising from cybersecurity or personal information protection.

Innovative ICT Products and Services
We predict that 5G technology will urge the development of the IoT in the near future. Services of emerging new 
type such as AI, big data, drones, AR, VR, smart family and smart long-term care will bring about global economic 
growth. CHT is already actively investigating innovative products and applied ICT service development. We 
expect a substantial increase in the Company’s business power from expansion in the innovative field.
CHT leads in the development of an IoT application platform using innovative technology. Five main services 
have been combined, including Information Security, Big Data, the Cloud, AI and AR. There are now more than 
2,830  SMEs using our platform. We have recruited a new talent force of 926 for the development of AI. There are 
10 data scientists and 154 professionals engaged in AI research.
In AI development, we would keep on improving in five business areas in 2018, and 7 main AI application 
services have been developed:
In video streaming services, we launched a tier-based pricing and profit-sharing model on our MOD platform. We give customers 
the freedom to choose what and when to watch, revolutionizing the way people watch TV. Even in a highly competitive market, 
we are able to employ effective product and marketing strategies to promote MOD through various channels and increase the 
public’s awareness of the MOD brand and the content available on the platform. In 2018, we secured the broadcast rights of 
important sporting events including the World Cup, the Asian Games, the International Esports Tournament, and Badminton 
World Federation’s Taipei Open, which allowed us to bring our total subscribers to upwards of   2 million .
Tapping into the market associated with the aging population, we launched th “iHealth Smart Cloud” service, which 
includes health promotion videos for the elderly and a function that allows them to upload records of their blood sugar 
level and blood pressure onto the cloud. We plan to integrate this system with that of local hospitals to provide even 
more comprehensive healthcare information for our customers. Furthermore, we plan to improve the connectivity of 
the MOD set-top box so that it will be possible to control smart appliances (such as air-conditioners, dehumidifiers, 
CCTV cameras, etc.) with a single push of a button. In the future, MOD will be integrated into CHT’s IoT network, further 
increasing its connectivity to include many other internet-based devices. This “Smart Home Gateway” plan has the 
potential to bring about even more innovative applications and services.
In 2018, CHT and the Taipei City Government signed the Memorandum of Understanding for “5G Smart 
City Service Innovation and Application.” We plan to cooperate in the following three projects: “integration 
of smart street lights into the mobile network: conception and testing,” “smart city Innovation: on-site 
demonstration and experimentation,” and “5G innovation: on-site demonstration and experimentation.” 
With our IoT network developed in-house and the Intelligent Operations Center (IOC), we will introduce to 
the city five key 5G related technologies–AI, big data, cloud computing, information security, and AR.
Thanks to the blooming industrial momentum in the “Taiwan 5G Alliance—CHT Pilot Team,” we are 
focusing future research on smart energy saving, smart traffic control, smart security, and smart 
commerce, further incorporating 5G technology into smart cities and industrial development.MoU for 5G Smart City Service Innovation and ApplicationAI Face

Since its launch, CHT’s IoT network has been adopted by more than 500  businesses and startups. The 
number is projected to reach 2,000  by the end of 2019. The fields of its implementation include smart 
agriculture, smart manufacturing, and smart traffic control. Apart from domestic industries, we actively 
seek business opportunities abroad. Currently, we are working with several other Taiwanese businesses to 
transfer IoT technology to ASEAN countries by means of “whole factory export.”
As part of the Industrial Development Bureau’s “Smart City Taiwan” campaign in 2018, we collaborated 
with local governments to bring smart technologies into towns big or small. In total, 16 projects across 
more than 10 counties and cities have been executed: Hsinchu ’s 5G street lights, Yilan’s smart parking 
meters, THSRC’s Wi-Fi service improvement, narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) for agriculture, AI irrigation 
monitoring, Kaohsiung’s LOHAS smart community care program, the smart urban traffic solutions in 
southern Taiwan, Hualien’s primary health institutions and long-term care program, Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan 
cashless college towns, automated convenience stores, and the intelligent railway transportation system.
We will showcase these groundbreaking achievements in the 2019 Smart Cities Expo. With“Smart Cities 
& Sustainable Future” as the central theme; the exhibition will be divided into six fields, “IoT platform,” 
“traffic management,” “smart home,” “smart life,” “environmental protection,” and “cloud computing.” 
We hope that by incorporating the idea of sustainability into our smart systems, we can build smart and 
green cities that define a brand new generation.Exporting Smart City Technologies to ASEAN Countries
International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates that 20% of major cities in the world will have some form 
of “Internet of Vehicles” (IoV) by 2021 and that the total capital invested in IoV will amount to US$ 37.9 
billion by 2022. It is apparent that IoV will create considerable value for the global economy.
As the leading telecommunications company in Taiwan, CHT actively invests resources into emerging 
technologies across various fields. With our abundance of experience in AI development and big data analytics 
as a foundation, we are building the back end for our IoV and autonomous vehicle system with the assistance 
of several business partners. As 5G networks come into play, the extremely low latency and reliable real-
time data transmission can help us improve the management of self-driving vehicle network. The massive 
bandwidth also allows passengers to enjoy all kinds of onboard entertainment during their rides.
To further the development of domestic 5G network-based industries, CHT is working with the Taiwan 
5G Alliance to test the application and integration of 5G on our IoT platform. We have confidence that 
commercial 5G will be a reality by 2020.5G Technology and Autonomous VehiclesiEN is a voice recognition software capable of semantic mapping and a form of artificial intelligence. 
Developed in-house by the CHT Labs, the platform can accelerate the AI processing speed in robots, 
widening the fields of potential service application. It will be the underlying technology for our first smart 
speaker product line.
To develop a smart home system with the MOD platform at its core, we rolled out multiple new features 
on the MOD platform in early 2019, including multitasking and voice control. Our customers can now 
speak to the TV to switch the channel or search for video-on-demand content. When our AI smart 
speaker is launched in the near future, our dream of a smart home system with even greater voice control 
functionality will finally be realized.Semantic Mapping Technology—The iEN Platform60

The core business market of the telecom industry (fixed network, mobile service and voice service) has 
gradually reached saturation. This will have an impact on revenue in the mid-long term. There might be a 
reduction of revenue from voice services, overly high costs for basic telecom construction, or influence of the 
OTT suppliers. We predict that the overall output value of the telecom industry will continue to decline until 
2020. Our innovative strategies to cope with this situation include enhancing the current core business, active 
research into new product development, and generate more revenue from new and innovative ICT products 
and services.

After more than a year of joint efforts between CHT , the government, and research institutions, the “4G 
Smart City—Local Produce O2O Distribution Platform” was finally launched. Through physical distribution 
channels, “food trucks flash mob” events, and the “Eat Healthy” e-commerce mobile app, the platform has 
created a complete O2O distribution system for local produce.
At the “Local Farmers Stand Together” press conference, CHT invited local governmental information 
and agriculture departments of Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Keelung to “stand  together” with local 
farmers. By combining the government ’s administrative resources, local farmers ’ quality products, and 
CHT ’s smart technologies, we hope to safeguard national food safety and people ’s health.Using Technology to Support Local Farmers
The Bureau of Energy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted a bill that requires “the use of 
microcomputer-embedded natural gas meters that are equipped with telecom capabilities and occlusion 
valves that activate in the event of earthquakes or low pressure” to increase safety standards. The bill is 
expected to come into force in 2021. CHT ’s Natural Gas Cloud system comes with cutting-edge NB-IoT 
technology and with our IoT network; we are kicking off the “Gas IoT Era” with services like remote gas 
meter reading, remote activation and deactivation, and real-time usage alerts.
To comply with the government ’s policy of replacing traditional gas meters with microcomputer-
embedded ones, we have signed letters of intent with multiple natural gas companies since 2018. With 
our NB-IoT solutions, the Natural Gas Cloud system can drastically lower operating and maintenance 
overheads. In the future, we plan to incorporate more functions into the system as value-added services, 
such as carbon monoxide detection and leakage alerts.The Natural Gas Cloud
CHT helped Taiwan Fire & Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. introduce blockchain technology and smart 
contract services into the management process of travel insurance policies. For example, our 
blockchain network regularly checks flight arrival and departure information, so when a particular 
flight is delayed, insured customers are immediately notified through text messages. Our smart 
contract system then processes insurance claims automatically and, if verified, payments are made 
directly in digital currencies. This technology was awarded the gold medal  at the 2018 Taiwan 
InnoTech Expo by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In the future, we plan to apply the technology 
to weather insurance, natural disaster insurance, car insurance, health insurance, and residential 
fire insurance, further exploring the possibilities and opportunities of insurance technology while 
simultaneously benefiting CHT , the insurance industry, and customers.Smart InsuranceSocial Innovation
Hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia are becoming more and more prevalent in Taiwan due to high 
stress, lack of exercise, and irregular lifestyles.
By combining CHT’s proficiency in networking and information security with medical equipment manufacturers’ 
products and medical institutions’ services, we are revolutionizing the way technology is used in the health care 
industry. In 2018, We introduced “CHT PHR,” an intelligent healthcare management system, to the following 
hospitals: Taipei Tri-Service General Hospital, Taiwan Landseed Hospital, Tung’s Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital, 
Zuoying Branch of Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, and Hualien Tzu-Chi General Hospital.
“CHT PHR” allows patients to self-monitor their blood pressure, sugar, and cholesterol levels in the comfort of 
their own homes. Users can choose to share this information with a healthcare professional to receive timely CHT Personal Health Record (CHT PHR)63

CHT launched the iEN intelligent environmental service in 2008. We provide corporate clients 
with energy management technology that helps reduce operational cost. In 2017, the iEN service 
embarked on water resource management to provide a full-scale water resource solution through 
information security and IoT technology.
1. Smart operation and management technology at the Mudan Reservoir: The reservoir monitoring 
system continuously collects information about the climate, water quality, the valve settings, 
embankment and slope. The system also provides suggestions about water discharge based on 
rainfall over the catchment area and the reservoir water level. Stability of the water supply has 
increased and this allows much better management of resources. The system can be effectively 
used for three applications, the use of stored water, flood control and reservoir safety.
2. Improved irrigation and water conservation management technology: An intelligent decision-
making system on the cloud, along with environmental monitoring equipment, calculates and 
delivers the precise amount of water needed for the irrigation of crops to effectively improve the 
efficiency of irrigation water conservation.
3. Treatment of household and industrial wastewater: This service monitors household and industrial 
water supply, billing, leaks, pipeline bursts, and minimum night flow (MNF). It also monitors the 
treatment process and the discharge flows in water plants in order to provide real-time parameters 
such as pH value, temperature, electrical conductivity, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) to 
prevent and mitigate water plant failures.iEN Water Resource ManagementEnvironmental Innovation 
medical advice. They can also share it with their friends and family so that they can be cared for and reminded 
to take medication—even if they are far away. We offer a variety of ways for you to check on your loved ones. You 
can do so on our mobile app, our website, or even through the MOD platform.
In terms of future plans, we want to replicate this success in other medical institutions. We are also looking to

https://www.cht.com.tw/home/consumer/broadband/broadband-service/660Due to difficulties connecting the smart bus information system to the power grid, New Taipei 
City’s Traffic Department commissioned CHT to install e-ink information displays at bus stops. 
These displays run on solar power and can be installed fairly quickly as they do not have to worry 
about being connected to the power grid. They can continue to function for  14 days even in gloomy 
weather. The system is currently in a trial stage at the Shiding Old Street and around Shimen Wulong 
Temple and is expected to be expanded to other rural areas.Solar-Powered Smart Bus System
A Central computer communicates with these e-ink display 
terminals to remotely check their battery conditions and provide 
accurate bus arrival information through an intranet system. As 
its name suggests, the displays are built with e-ink technology; 
they are UV resistant, anti-glare, anti-fouling, and highly energy 
efficient—an e-ink display ( 63W) only requires one tenth of the 
power consumed by a regular smart display (600+W).64

IoT is at the forefront of emerging technology development. We are leading the way for Taiwan to 
enter the international IoT market by promoting IoT technology education and encouraging students 
to demonstrate their innovation through competitions. The “IoT Smart Platform” competition 
comprises two divisions, one for students and the other for industry professionals. The central theme 
for the competition is “integrating information technology and smart terminal devices into the IoT 
application and solutions.”
The first “IoT Smart Platform” competition was held in 2018, with a top prize of NT$ 1 million  to 
encourage IoT innovation. With “digital life” as the underlying concept, participants compete against 
one another to try and come up with the most innovative and practical IoT solutions that are also 
commercially viable. The winner of the professional division was Union U Inc., and the winner of the 
student division was National Formosa University (NFU).
The “WFduino IoT Educational App” developed by Union U Inc. transforms complicated programming 
language into simple block-based “Scratch” visual representations. Through creating and stacking 
“Scractch blocks,” students can develop their own software without any prior knowledge in 
programming. WFduino, dubbed the “IoT Education Accelerator” by the Company, allows students 
to channel their creativity into app design without having to worry about the incessant details of 
programming languages.
NFU ’s “Samrtify Your Home” project proposed a different approach to intelligent homes. Instead 
of replacing existing appliances with smart devices, the team installed modular electronic blocks 
onto traditional household appliances. These blocks can detect a variety of input signals, effectively 
“smartifying” traditional appliances with minimum expense required. NFU ’s design provides a quick 
and cost-effective route to IoT implementation.
Later that year, we organized an employee version of the “IoT Smart Platform” competition. Out of 
248  submissions,  10 projects received awards (three top prizes and seven honorable mentions). 
Winning proposals were sent to the appropriate CHT ’s subsidiaries as a reference for future product 
development. The competition both offered CHT a chance to discover talent that would have 
otherwise remained hidden in the corporate structure, while allowing employees to demonstrate 
their creativity. We hope that the positive energy of innovation created by healthy competition can 
further drive IoT development in the Company.IoT Smart Platform Competition

Ensuring Employees’Happiness
Chunghwa Telecom treats employees as their most important business partners. To ensure the best protection 
for the work rights of the employees, Chunghwa Telecom signs an “Employment Contract” with each 
employee and undertakes to notify them of any changes in terms of employment in compliance with the Labor 
Standards Act. Furthermore, CHT uses several different channels, including seminars and labor-management 
meetings, to maintain harmony and a mutually beneficial working relationship with employees.
We have a “Compensation Committee” in place to ensure that compensation for the best talent is competitive. In addition, 
the Company has a transparent system for sharing business performance with its employees. Compensation for executive 
management has been standardized and details are disclosed publicly in the annual reports. The Company offers equal 
compensation for all entry-level employees of the same grade. Those who possess relevant skills and work experience 
may have compensation evaluated based on educational background, career experience, expertise, and professional 
qualifications. Under no circumstances will compensation ever be determined by gender or racial differences.Protecting the Rights of Workers

Human Resources Structure at CHT 
CHT has more than 22 thousand employees with an average age of more than 51-year-old. There will be 
more than 5 thousand employees retiring over the next 5 years, and 50% of the employees will be eligible for 
retirement over the next 10 years. Current senior management is included in this retirement tide. To cope with 
this problem CHT is actively cultivating new talents to ensure that knowledge is passed down to foster the 
talents of a new generation.

Chunghwa Telecom understands that the industry competition we are facing now is not only the 
telecommunications industry, but the changing information and communication industry chain. In the future, 
the recruitment direction of talents will be based on the large-scale public recruitment method which focuses 
on various professional fields. We will adopt an external network approach to transform Chunghwa Telecom ’s 
talents into an important kinetic energy for the continuous improvement of the next stage.

Chunghwa Telecom places great value on human rights and gender equality. In 2018, female staff 
accounted for  28.5 % of the total, and 26.32 % of the managers were women. To conform to the essence 
of the Gender Equality in the Employment Act, the Company has outlined its sexual harassment 
prevention policy and established a “Complaint Investigation Committee” that specializes in the 
handling of employee complaints about work-related discrimination and improper behavior. The 
investigation committee has 5 members, 3 of whom are female. Our effective control has resulted in no 
incident of discrimination being reported  in 2018.
CHT has done more than comply with the quota required by Article 38 of the Persons with Disabilities 
Rights Protection Act and have hired more than the required number. In 2018, the number of persons 
with disabilities hired was 3.84  times more than the statutory quota. (quota: 208; actual hire: 799 ). 
Where a department or institution employs a seriously disabled person in accordance with the act, the 
disabled person shall be calculated as two. We had 46 aboriginal employees on board in 2018. We fully 
respect their cultures and no violation of work or human rights was reported  during the year.Gender Equality and Diversity
The Only Telecom Carrier in Taiwan with a Union
Chunghwa Telecom is the only  telecom carrier in Taiwan with a union established. We have signed a collective 
bargaining agreement with them which covers an extensive range of issues from redundancy, reward, 
discipline, promotion, to health and safety. This initiative not only complies with local laws and international 
human rights conventions, but is also a show of our commitment to the protection of employee interests. In 
addition to the union established by Chunghwa Telecom, employees have also assembled 11 other unions 
under the organization. In 2018, 99.86 % of employees were union members. A director ’s seat has also been 
reserved for a workers ’ representative, through whom workers can more freely express opinions.
Chunghwa Telecom complies with Article 16 of the 
group agreement about transfers. If there is a need 
to transfer a union member due to changes in the 
organization such as establishment, alteration, 
merger, and/or closure of a department, the Company 
will do so only if necessary and will respect the wishes 
of the member. In addition, all transfers must comply 
with the “Five Principles” of the Labor Standards Act.
Due to a spike in demand during the “NT$ 499 Unlimited Data Plan” campaign in 2018, employees 
were asked to work overtime. The Ministry of Labor determined CHT to be liable for 18 counts of 
labor law violations.
Immediately after the incident occurred, CHT complied with the Labor Standards Act and notified the 
labor union within 24 hours. Employees who worked overtime were compensated with double pay 
and additional paid leave. After the Ministry of Labor denied our appeal, CHT filed an administrative 
lawsuit in which the judge nullified the Ministry of Labor ’s original decision and issued new fines 
amounting to NT$ 5.44 million.The “Plan 499” Incident

Open Communication and Grievance Channels
We have open communication channels in place to ensure that employees ’needs or suggestions are heard. Any 
violation or misconduct in the workplace can be reported to the relevant department using the channels provided. 
There were 52 complaints in 2018. Of these, 50 were disciplinary investigations and included such behavior as 
disrespect of the CHT system, principles, administrative management, violation of the employee code of conduct or 
other misconduct, and two were leak investigations. There were no human rights related cases in 2018.
We hold regular labor-management meetings to maintain contact between employees and the employer. There 
are  9 representatives from each side, employer and employees. The chair is held by each side in turn. The Chairman 
and President of Chunghwa Telecom engage regularly with the Chairman of the Union, Directors, and Supervisors 
in meetings, in person and by telephone. The Chairman of the Chunghwa Telecom Workers Union is entitled to 
participate in disciplinary review meetings, performance appraisals, and business report meetings to ensure that 
workers are kept up to date on Company news. In 2018, the Company held  6 nationwide labor-management 
meetings and 2 extraordinary meeting during which employees and the employer were able to reach consensus on 
many issues. Meetings for the discussion of particular matters can be convened, or if any change to work conditions 
is necessary. Eight such meetings were held in 2018.
1. To ensure compliance with the law and to protect the rights of CHT and its employees, 
the Company requires all front-line business divisions to perform self-inspections of 
compliance with labor laws. In the event of a government labor inspection, front-line staff 
must immediately notify to the human resources department at the CHT headquarter.
2. Due to the increased frequency of government labor inspections, CHT has hired labor law 
attorneys to give a series of lectures on labor environment self-inspection to strengthen 
employees ’ practical knowledge in labor management. In total, 2,559  employees 
participated in the three sessions held in 2018, totaling 14 hours of training.Improvement

Focusing on Employee Training and Development
Our fundamental business focus is “core competitiveness, professionalism, efficiency, and service” and we 
seek to develop innovative talent through a combination of internal and external training.
We have a comprehensive training system to assist employee development in all dimensions. The system 
starts with the incorporation of “needs analysis” and “in-depth planning” and is followed by performance 
assessment and review after the program ends. This systematic approach enhances professional skill and 
work efficiency, and helps the Company improve its coordination of human resources.
The Chunghwa Telecom Telecom Training Institute has devised human resource development 
strategies based on business focus and talent requirements between 2017 and 2019.Human Resource Development Strategies

3. New business potentials
• The Company organized 23 courses for AI professional 
skills training to cultivate AI talent; there were 1,545 
enrollments.
• The Company organized 30 courses for the training 
of facilitators, promoters, planners, designers, and 
maintenance workers for photovoltaic technology; there 
were 833  enrollments.Digital Classroom
Chunghwa Telecom has introduced an online learning 
social network (the Digital Classroom) with an e-Learning 
approach quite unlike that of conventional classroom 
teaching. In this new learning social network where users 
may share and transfer knowledge at a lower cost, and 
with a far better yield of good results. The broadband 
installation college, for example, is a platform where 
information such as technical documents, cases, video 
tutorials, and technical discussions can be exchanged and 
learned.
Online Broadcast
Online broadcasts can be used to teach topics related 
to specific work. They are delivered over the internal 
UC platform, and offer employees a fast and convenient 
way to gain knowledge and observe new trends. Online 
broadcasts transmit the experiences of experts to all 
employees without limit and boost business growth. 
The topics in 2018 included core business, ICT extended 
business, business in the new field and new knowledge of 
management and health care. There were  216  classes with 
20,716 participants.Government-industry-university-institute platform

Diverse Learning ChannelsChunghwa Telecom has founded the “Telecom Training Institute” that specializes in training technical as well as 
managerial talent in the telecom field to gain more core competitive advantages. A “Talent Development Team” 
has also been established, with the President as convener, to conduct regular reviews of the planning and outcome 
of training. This is important to ensure that the training outcome is closely aligned with the operational policy to 
achieve a “seamless combination of training and practice.”
To meet the needs of the organization, and the personal interest and even the personality traits of employees, 
the Telecom Training Institute provides a diversity of learning channels. These help employees develop new in-
depth professional ability as well as a renewal of their management skills to bring about growth and proper career 
development. Employees can attend training at the Telecommunication Training Institute during regular hours, in 
the evening or on holidays. The institute can also dispatch tutors to relevant business units for organized training 
sessions. The institute offers 8 learning channels: class teaching, distance education, digital learning, direct-
broadcast courses, the Digital College, online broadcast, external programs, and the digital library.75

New Employee Orientation
Fair Evaluation
Nurturing of Professional TalentsOrientation provides new recruits with a general understanding of company vision, values and culture 
that helps them adapt to the new work environment and culture. “New Recruit Counseling Guidelines for 
Chunghwa Telecom and Subordinate Institutions” were introduced in 2014 as well as a counselor system and 
digital learning tools to reduce the steepness of the new employees’ learning curve.
Chunghwa Telecom now applies “Employees Performance Evaluation Guidelines” which are used in the appraisal 
of employee performance to develop the corporate culture where employees, customers, shareholders, and the 
Company will all be winners. Supervision will be provided for underperforming employees who will be guided until 
the appropriate improvement has been made and they are back on track.
CHT conducts performance appraisal at two levels: general staffs and senior managers. Performance appraisal 
involves a series of face-to-face discussions between employees and line managers at the beginning of a year to set 
personal goals, and also at mid-year and years end to evaluate the degree of employee contribution to Company 
performance. Performance bonuses and employee remuneration are tied to performance.
Chunghwa Telecom is dedicated to providing employees with a diverse learning environment. In 2018, 
Chunghwa Telecom training expenses exceeded NT$ 500 million  and employee training sessions totaled 
908  thousand hours. We encourage employees to commit themselves to long-term learning and we offer 
education subsidies as much as NT$ 30,000  per semester. Subsidies were given to 376  employees in 2018 and 
the Company compensation amounted to NT$ 6.3 million.
The Happiness at Work Survey 
Since 2011, we have been engaging outside agencies to carry out annual “Chunghwa Telecom Happiness at 
Work Surveys” on an anonymous basis. This helps us to understand how employees feel about their work 
and their working status, and are used as a reference for the improvement of management. The survey 
topics include individual opinions about the working environment, welfare and corporate transformation. 
By listening to the opinions of the employee, we get to understand their feelings and expectations. The 2018 
“Happiness at Work” survey graded at an average of 81.74  points out of 100. In total, 6,063  questionnaires 
were returned ( 28% recovery rate), 5,089  of which were determined to be valid ( 84%). We will continue these 
surveys and respond to employee opinions.Chunghwa Telecom will encounter a wave of senior management retirements. Therefore, in response to 
business expansion and the rapid development of emerging technologies, CHT is actively recruiting new 
employees—we plan to hire 1,600  new recruits in 2019. The following measures have been developed as a 
response to reduce disruption in the transfer of knowledge:
• Recruiting professional talent in ICT , AIoT , 5G application, technology innovation, and other new business opportunities.
• The nurturing of the next-generation talent: The Company introduces new talent-training programs on a yearly basis. It 
provides employees with professional and diverse training options, and certifies the development of skill.
• Emerging businesses: new ICT technologies are being infused with knowledge from other fields. The Company will focus 
on training professionals who can adapt and apply their knowledge across several different fields of expertise such as 
cloud computing, big data, and product packaging to actual practices.Recruitment and Development of the New-Generation Talents

Chunghwa Telecom was the first telecom service provider in Taiwan to adopt the OHSAS 18000 
Occupational Health and Safety Management System. By the end of 2018, 26 Company business groups 
and branches had already passed international certification. We use careful systematic management 
to ensure the health and safety of our employees. In addition to identifying hazards and assessing the 
risks associated with telecom operations, the Company has also applied restrictions and enhanced risk 
control for high-risk tasks, while taking effective precautions to reduce occupational hazards. In addition 
to complying with safety and health regulations, the Company has also been active in the improvement 
of the current work environment and takes regular action with regard to safety and health facilities and 
measures.
We take part in all government initiatives and actively promote a healthy workplace. 5 divisions within 
the Company have received awards under the “National Workplace Safety and Health Campaign” 
organized by the Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare.
The Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18000 was replaced with ISO 45001 in 2018. 
CHT plans to complete the certification process for all its business divisions by 2020.
The Dedicated Occupational Safety and Health Management Unit
We have a dedicated “Labor Safety and Health Department” responsible for the planning and implementation of 
labor safety and health matters. A “Labor Safety and Health Committee” has also been created that meets every 
quarter to deliberate, coordinate and make suggestions on labor safety and health issues.
The “Labor Safety and Health Committee” has 29 members, including representatives from each department unit 
and the labor union as well as several technicians and medical personnel. Among these, 10 members are from 
the labor union, accounting for 35%. 4 meetings were held in 2018 and 5 proposals were presented by the labor 
representatives. Three of these were related to the improvement of safety and health facilities, one to the refinement 
of safety and health management, and one was related to employee benefits.77

Full-Time Physicians and Nurses to Improve Employee’s Health Management
To better provide immediate medical assistance and attend to worker health, we engaged 20 full-time nurses and 
contracted 22 physicians in 2018 for this specific purpose. They were assigned to locations at Xinyi, Aiguo, the Da ’an 
Industrial Park, New Taipei City, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Central Taiwan, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung.
The Company has deployed 6 i-med Systems at local customer centers for employees involved in high-risk activities. 
Blood pressure is measured and employees are given careful health checks before they engage in any high-risk work. 
This reduces the risk of accidents in high-risk situations.In 2018, CHT ’s mobile business group (including its offices in Taipei, 
Taichung, and Kaohsiung) became the first cellular service provider in 
Taiwan to receive ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety) certification. 
The group was also the first  to receive OHSAS 18001 and TOSHMS 
certifications, including Mobile Business Group and Taipei, Taichung, and 
Kaohsiung Branch.
Since its establishment, CHT has always put great emphasis on 
occupational safety. We implement corporate level health & safety by 
providing adequate training, instituting control measures, performing 
internal audits, and conducting on-site inspections. Due to the withdrawal 
of the OHSAS 18000 standard, CHT ’s southern Taiwan business group is 
in the process of updating its safety management procedures to meet 
the ISO 45001 requirements. CHT plans to complete the ISO 45001 
certification process for all our business divisions by 2020.The First Telecom Carrier in Taiwan 
to Receive ISO 45001 Certification
A significant portion of Chunghwa Telecom employees are 50 years old or more. This is one reason 
why we consider health care an important issue, especially for senior employees. In 2018, we 
launched a series of health checkups and health management programs for senior employees. In 
addition to helping them develop physical capabilities, it was also part of our intention to create a 
support system among friends.
1. Health checkups： The Company provided checkup services specifically targeted at senior employees, including carotid duplex 
and echocardiography for the risk of ischemic stroke, coronary artery narrowing and incomplete heart valve closure, as well as 
fundus photography for checking macular degeneration, retinal vessels and glaucoma.
2. Health promotion lectures： The Company invited the head of Chinese Medicine at Taipei City Hospital Ren-Ai Branch to give a 
lecture on the idea of “preserving health and health maintenance.” The Company also invited a dietitian from Chi-Hsin Health 
Clinic to talk about “eating correctly to prevent cardiovascular diseases,” emphasizing the importance of health planning towards 
the maintenance of bodily functions.
3. Others： As a countermeasure to influenza outbreaks, Chunghwa Telecom subsidized influenza vaccination for 1,561  employees.Health Promotions for Senior Employees 
In 2018, the Sports Administration of the Ministry of Education cooperate withＧlobal Views Monthly 
to organize National Fitness Program, 156  employees from CHT Xinyi Park signed up to learn more 
about fitness.The program included body measurements (height, weight, waist line, hip line, muscle 
mass, body fat, protein/mineral levels, and degree of obesity), muscle strength training (grips), 
flexibility training (forward flexion exercise), and cardiorespiratory fitness (knee-ups), designed to 
help employees learn more about their health and absorb new knowledge about sports.National Fitness Program78

A Safe and Healthy WorkplaceThe Chunghwa Telecom “Work Accident Guidelines” contain detailed procedures for assessing occupational illness. Employees 
suspected of having become ill as a result of their occupation are assisted with an application for verification at the local 
municipal/county/city authority, in accordance with the “Protecting Workers from Occupational Accidents Act.” We manage 
risks at the source, by making sure that construction risks are under control from the early design stages of a project. The line 
construction management system has been amended with respect to highlighting high-risk operations as well as risk assessment 
information to ensure operators are able to identify potential risk in advance. All high-risk operations are subject to approval 
by the ICT . Workers are also required to take site pictures with handheld devices and upload them to the monitoring system so 
that precautionary measures can be identified and taken to prevent such accidents as falls, oxygen deprivation, etc. To promote 
employee awareness and safety and health skills, we organized 138 training sessions in 2018 and there were 6,949  enrollments.
The Company encountered 50 cases of occupational hazard in 2018; 27 of which had occurred during work (including 
14 traffic accidents and 2 fatalities—one in a car accident, and the other struck by falling objects when operating a 
stacker), during commuting, a work-related injury, a traffic accident while commuting, and a fall. To raise employee 
awareness of traffic safety and reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents, we organized the “Prevention and Handling 
of Traffic Accident” training. The instruction was given by members of the New Taipei City Traffic Accident Investigation 
Committee. Employees are constantly being reminded at the Occupational Safety and Health Committee meetings, 
work safety meetings, and training sessions to exercise greater attention to personal safety and safe driving. 
CHT considers its employees ’ health to be a valuable company asset. Providing a safe and healthy workplace 
is a basic requirement of good corporate social responsibility. In 2018, we spent NT$ 81,430 thousand on 
employee health care. Our contributions in relation to employee health included:

Flexible Working 
Hours• Chunghwa Telecom provides two flexible working hour sessions in the morning and afternoon: 8:00~9:00 and 
17:00~18:00. As part of our effort to mobilize management, the “eSafe Wizard” app allows employees and contractors to report 
safety violations and apply for operation permits. The app also allows us to remotely perform spot checks on safety 
compliance, moving the entire management process onto the cloud. It is completely paperless, instantaneous, and 
highly effective. In 2018, 90.8 % of operation permits (including hot work, lifting, scaffolding, electrical maintenance, 
and fire-safety shutdowns) were issued through the system, and 97% of safety violations were reported on the app.
The app received the “Innovation in Labor Safety Awards” presented by Taipei City Government ’s Department of Labor. We 
want to share this technology with others, which is why the app is currently in use not only across all CHT business divisions, 
but also by Taiwan Railway Administration and Taiwan Power Company.
App Functionality
1. Mobilization—the“eSafe Wizard”app includes the following functions: safety violation notification, automatic safety 
inspection, operation permit application, on-site inspection, remote spot checks, internal communication, and 
occupational health & safety quizzes.
2. Significant outcomes were achieved using“eSafe Wizard” as an operations management tool in 2018. It is completely 
paperless, mobile, instantaneous, effective, and convenient.
3. Significant outcomes were achieved promoting“eSafe Wizard”as a project management tool across all business divisions.
4. The notification function of the app is an effective channel for promoting occupational health & safety. The app also allows 
users to learn more about safety and take quizzes online. The “eSafe Wizard” AppCHT ’s northern branch contracted a trucking company 
to transport cables to its Neihu warehouse. During 
the unloading process, a worker did not clear the 
vehicle ’s operating zone and this wasn ’t noticed by 
the driver, resulting in his death. After the accident, 
we immediately notified the relevant government 
agencies in accordance with the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act and sat down with warehouse 
employees to review safety procedures.Contractor Accident at Neihu Warehouse
Improvement Measures

for Material Transporting in Warehouses.”
2. Convene with warehouse employees and 
contractors to reinforce safety training and 
awareness.
3. Organize an employee assistance program 
(EAP) to provide professional counseling

Building a Happy Business
CHT regard employees as important assets. We offer a commitment to “Peace of mind” to our employees, 
and refrain from making layoffs and salary reductions. This means employees can devote themselves 
fully to boosting performance at work to create more value for themselves and the Company. In response 
to the government ’s policy to boost birth rates in 2018, CHT is providing childcare and maternity benefits 
to young employees with children aged 0–6 years old.
We are committed to building through software and hardware resources, so that employees can be 
confident in their work, creating higher value for individuals and businesses, and create a healthy and 
secure business.
Welfare is provided for employees of Chunghwa Telecom, but not for those of subsidiaries.
The ever-rising housing prices in Taiwan make it difficult to retain highly skilled R&D workers. 
Therefore, CHT is building smart & green dormitories to attract technological talent to join 
the company, fostering our long-term ability to embrace and develop new technology while 
contributing towards environmental sustainability.
The Smart & Green Dormitory Project at Yangmei, costing NT$ 300 million, is estimated to be 
completed by 2021, providing a cozy, healthy, safe, and convenient environment for our staff to 
live in. Similar projects are under way at Wanhua and Sanchong.Building Smart & Green Company DormitoriesItem Activities and DescriptionNumber of

Monthly pension contributions were made in accordance with the “Monthly Contribution Wages Classification 
Scheme” published by the Ministry of Labor, subject to biannual adjustments.Better Maternity Benefits than the Legal Requisites
Retirement BenefitsWe have been implementing an unpaid childcare leave system since 2006 to help employees juggle their 
attention between work and family. Chunghwa Telecom is required, under the Employment Insurance Act, to 
pay a six months maternity allowance to employees who give birth. Female employees who have taken this 
leave are further entitled, under company policy, to receive an additional monthly allowance of half the sum 
assured under the Labor Insurance Scheme during child care leave, for a period up to two years. Employees of 
Chunghwa Telecom are also entitled to other privileges such as family care leave, paternity leave, menstrual 
leave, and a nursery room service.
In 2018, 102  employees applied for unpaid child care leave; 127  employees applied for child care leave 
allowances. NT$ 14,984 thousand was paid out as child care leave allowances, an increase of NT$ 160  
thousand over 2017.
Employee requests for retirement are processed in accordance with the “Chunghwa Telecom Employee Retirement 
Pension and Separation Guidelines,” the “Labor Standards Act,” and the “Labor Pensions Act.”
• The Labor Standards Act: The Company makes monthly pension contributions of up to 15% of an employees ’monthly salary to the pension fund. 
This fund is held under the auspices of the Labor Pension Supervisory Committee. The current balance of the pension fund account is 38.8  billion.
• The Labor Pension Act: The Company makes monthly contributions of no less than 6% of an employees ’monthly salary. These contributions are 
deposited in the employees ’pension account held by the Bureau of Labor Insurance of the Ministry of Labor, in accordance with the Contribution 
Rate Sheet approved by the Executive Yuan.
To help employees adapt to life after retirement, the Telecom Training Institute organized a series of “Retiree Adaptation 
Courses.” 10 sessions were held in 2018 for audiences totaling 466 . Furthermore, a donation of NT$ 4.5 million was made 
to the “Chunghwa Telecom Retirees Association” for various activities, and NT$ 1.5 million for the organization of travel 
events. A further NT$ 300,000  was donated for a Chinese New Year banquet held for volunteers.
To help facilitate the transfer of knowledge and experience, we have established a set of “Consultant Recruitment 
Guidelines” and retired employees engage in our endeavors to maintain continuous growth. Consultants can have a paid 
or honorary role. Executive vice presidents and above, and heads of first-grade institutions, may be hired by Chunghwa 
Telecom as paid consultants after retirement. Paid consultants shall serve a term of no more than one year, and assume 
honorary roles from the day after the one-year period has expired.1. The number of employees entitled to apply for a parental leave of absence in 2018 (A): calculated as employees who had

We proactively monitor human rights issues, and actively protect the value of human rights. We have 
responded to the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO Convention on the elimination of all forms of 
discrimination and the prohibition of forced and child labor. We have also responded to the UN International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural 
Rights. We are dedicated to the promotion of human rights awareness and to the assurance of respect and fair 
treatment to all stakeholders.
CHT is a member of the International Telecom Union and we fully comply with all the “International Radio 
Regulations” established with respect to equal rights to information. The regulation lays down rules 
concerning: freedom of communication, transparency in global roaming charges and competition, the support 
of Telecoms in developing nations, telecom services for persons with disabilities and the freedom of speech 
over telecom networks.
In addition, we support the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, for which a human rights 
due diligence investigation is presently being conducted. We also make sure that each human rights issue in 
the operational value chain is evaluated and we maintain all risk at a minimum level.Human Rights Value Protection
Human rights issues include anti-discrimination, gender equality, freedom of association, collective 
bargaining, child labor, forced or compulsory labor, and aboriginal rights.

Human Rights Material Risk Issues
After a study of the 2018 risk analysis and inspection of the human rights value chain, we have concluded 
the following material issues, including:
Local Human Rights
To fulfill the concept of anti-forced labor and appropriate working environment, we required the bidders to sign a 
“Declaration of Minerals as Conflict-Free” at the procurement phase. We evaluated the suppliers to determine if raw 
materials derived from human rights high-risk areas like the République Démocratique du Congo were being utilized 
to avoid further infringement of the basic human rights of local residents in places where we provided information 
communication services and products. We depend on demand and require the suppliers to provide certification of 
material resources, third-party verification or accepted auditing to confirm no related violations.
We also required that all suppliers complied with the “Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive” (RoHS) 
to prevent hazardous substances from the source endangering local employees, the environment or customers. 
Employment Human Rights.
Employment Human Rights
We use the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSAS 18000; ISO 45001) to avoid potential risk 
and have systematically fulfilled employee safety and health management. In addition to compliance with the 
safety and health-related regulations toward high-risk tasks, we have also enhanced risk control. We continue to 
improve the working environment and act in regards to safety and health facilities and measures to actively ensure 
employee protection.
Sometimes customer service personnel encounter irrational requests and even personal abuse from customers in 
the course of the provision of our services. We established an SOP for employee response and acted at a critical 
level in certain circumstances. Legal assistance can be authorized to aid in the event of serious offenses and to 
prevent illegal practices. CHT adopted the ISO 10002 quality management system in 2011 and have a certified and 
flawless customer service procedure and management mechanism in place. In addition, we regularly offer pertinent 
educational training courses in customer relations, the management of emotional stress, and occupational hazard 
prevention. While building up professional capability, we positively avoid pressure on customer service personnel 
to avoid mental and physical health problems. Customer service personnel were given 8 training courses during the 
year and training hours totaled 1,490 hours in 2018.
Customer Human Rights
Due to the nature of our industry, in addition to establishing information security management applicable to the 
enterprise operation, we also implement measures to safeguard our customer’s personal information. To improve 
our operational management, we implemented information security in compliance with the international standards 
ISO 27001 and BS 10012 and carried out regular supplier auditing and supervision through employees or a third 
party. We also carried out vulnerability scanning and the testing of all equipment and software from outside 
suppliers to ensure there were no back-doors or malware.
We take customer privacy protection very seriously and in addition to acquiring the customer’s agreement before 
the collection of any personal information, we established the internal “Security and Safety Principle of Customer 
Information Re-use.” This means that personnel need to make formal application and receive managerial approval 
before being granted the authority that allows access to the advanced information security system. The system 
itself not only supervises and records employee operations but also only reveals the number of customers under 
certain conditions without touching detailed information. Related information also complies with the principle of 
“no names are revealed” to prevent the downloading of personal information and avoid leakage or disclosure.
Information Equality
Chunghwa Telecom is creating a free and open information sharing environment without technological boundaries 
that can be shared by everyone. Such a system inherits culture, extends education, promotes industry, and 
upgrading art with a connection to the universe of the Internet. Digital technology can be beneficial to everyone 
irrespective of age, social standing, wealth, geographical location, or education. We base our approach on the 
characteristics of the ICT industry and the spirit of “value is where the responsibility lies,” in our work with the 
communities in Taiwan. Our main objective is to “minimize the digital divide and create digital opportunities,” 
Chunghwa Telecom watches the trends of this digital divide and offer solutions that facilitate social innovation and 
digital inclusion. We spare no effort in the advocacy of the “corporate volunteer,” participate in community services, 
and proactively assist communities in the creation of digital opportunities.84

and 268  franchised stores, a total of 737  service outlets that provide convenient service for all consumers in 
cities, or even in remote areas in Taiwan.Safeguarding Consumer Rights and Interests
Digital Transformation of Diverse Virtual and Physical Channel Services
We provide a handbook about products and services for consumers that details product characteristics and 
applications, consider the negative aspect of overuse, and has friendly reminders provided while marketing. 
In addition, Chunghwa Telecom has set up the “Channel Sale Support Items Management Guideline” and 
“Channel Sales Support Items Management Implementation Procedures” to make the display of sales support 
items and operation management consistent throughout all the service and business locations. This ensures a 
positive service environment for consumers. These are vital for maintaining a superior and professional image 
as well as the service quality at Chunghwa Telecom. No violations of health and safety and product labeling 
was reported in 2018.Ethical Marketing and Information Transparency
Following the establishment of the first  telecom combinative store in Taiwan in 2017, more stores were 
established in Zhongli, Miaoli and Hsinchu in 2018. The stores include a cafe, 3C and an experimental display. 
Green store capability was also developed and energy saving household appliances such as TV, refrigerators, air 
purifiers and even electric bicycles provide customers with new service experiences.Diverse Services －The CHT Combinative Store

In 2018, there were 12 complaints about alleged information leakage, 2 cases fewer than in 2017. Complaints 
of this type accounted for only 0.00003% of our customer service hotline. The cases were checked using all the 
available channels and none of them were proved to be the result of a violation of the relevant regulations.

Chunghwa Telecom provides services which are 
refined, thoughtful and professional to build warm 
atmosphere around customer relations. We use big 
data analysis to learn the true needs of customers so 
that we can offer thoughtful and customized services 
and products. In 2018, CHT was crowned the “Customer 
Service Excellence Award (CSEA)” by the Taiwan 
Contact Center Development Association (TCCDA), 
and our call center was given the “Best Telemarketing 
Team” award. We also ranked as the No. 1 “4G service 
provider” in Next Magazine’s 15th Annual Outstanding 
Service List in the same year.
CHT’s positive approach cultivates both favorable impressions and brand loyalty. We set high standards for our 
customer service hotline. To ensure quality service, we sought multiple international certifications, including 
ISO 9001, ISO 10002, BS 10012, and ISO/IEC 27001. In recent years, we have been using big data analytics to 
identify customers’ concerns and to improve the overall user experience. Through sincere communication and 
system improvements, we are able to create additional value for our customers.

Training
ResultWe use customer service training workshops to refine our customer-centric approach and devotion to the 
provision of the most thoughtful services. In 2018 5 such workshops were held in the Chunghwa Telecom 
training facilities in Banqiao, Taichung, and Kaohsiung. A total of 345  people participated in these training 
sessions which were also made available online for remote teaching. CHT holds a very high standard for 
customer representatives. Besides the basic requirement of tone and manners of speech, we place even more 
emphasis on professional knowledge and competence. In 2018 alone, 5,684  employees received 141,207 
hours of training combined.

We continue to bring innovation to the way customers communicate with us to improve user experience. In 
2017, we created the “AI Customer Service Chatbot,” which is 100 % in-house developed by CHT Labs. Customer 
representatives took on the role of “robot trainers,” transforming massive yet disorganized customer data 
into useful and systematic information in the AI knowledge base. Developers also designed various customer 
interaction scenarios to fine-tune the chatbot ’s machine learning process. The goal is to offer 24/7 real-time 
customer service, providing users with useful information and solving basic issues that might arise.
A preliminary version of the chatbot was launched in 2018 for our cellular service business division, 
and as of year-end 2018, 60,000  out of 100,000  calls ( 60%) were answered and resolved by the 
chatbot, with an AI recognition success rate of  96%. The overall outcomes were satisfactory.
We plan to include our ISDN and ADSL services in the chatbot in 2019, and ADSL would provide 
functions such as answering customer inquiries (e.g., data usage, unpaid bills, contract details, etc.) 
and purchasing international roaming services. AI Customer Service Chatbot87

To inspire passion and professionalism among customer service officers, we reward customer service 
personnel who receive praise from customers, and accept these credits as part of their performance appraisal 
as an excellent service quality. Meanwhile, a “Service Excellence” section has been created on the Intranet to 
publish cases of excellent service for personnel to share, learn and download.
In 2011, Chunghwa Telecom became the telecom carrier to have all its centers certified for the “ISO 10002:2004 
Customer Complaint Management System.” The Company views customer complaints as opportunities to make 
ongoing improvements. The resolution of customer complaints and dissatisfaction is rule-based and they must 
be settled within 3 working days. This approach ensures the continuous improvement of service quality. In 
addition to the customer service hotline, consumers may also use the corporate website or Representative Line 
authorized by the President (02-23446789) to raise complaints directly to the assistance of the senior executive.
We conduct a broad variety of satisfaction surveys to identify the issues of 
most concern to consumers and their expectations. We use these findings to 
guide future improvements. After each survey, the opinions and suggestions 
are conveyed promptly to product or business personnel (including Risk 
Management and the Public Relations Departments) using the consumer 
feedback system. Furthermore, consumers ’ opinions are brought to the 
attention of the senior manager of the product and customer service 
departments for discussion at monthly meetings to ensure that the consumers ’ 
expectations receive proper consideration.
Regarding the IPA (Importance-Performance Analysis) items belonging to the 
fourth quadrant (high importance and low performance) after a review of 
the results of the annual satisfaction survey, we will request that the relevant 
functional units conduct further analysis and propose measures for concrete 
improvement every year. There will also be a follow-up in the next quarter to 
keep track of the progress of any corrective action found necessary. Due to a 
spike in demand during the Mother ’s Day promotion, customer satisfaction 
decreased in 2018.

We have also supported the government initiative for the promotion of free wireless Internet services on a nationwide scale. By making 
a reasonable Wi-Fi rental package available, as well as a robust user authentication platform and a nationwide maintenance/monitoring 
system, we have helped the government deploy free Wi-Fi hotspots all over the country. By the end of 2018, we had installed more than 
57,000  public Wi-Fi hotspots, giving users access to stable high-bandwidth in a densely covered Wi-Fi service.
Our contributions to social events in 2018 included working with local county and city governments to provide Wi-Fi hotspots and enable 
Internet access at festive gatherings and international sports events. We installed 330 hotspots for the 2018 Flora Expo, 74 hotspots for 
New Year ’s Eve festivity, 197 for the Lantern Festival and about  64 for other activities. The Company participated in 23 festive occasions, 
built 665 hotspots in total, and spent more than NT$ 7.7 million.Expand Wireless HotspotsWe are constantly expanding our mobile network. We have the most 4G cell towers and the highest 4G signal coverage in Taiwan. 
According to test results published by the government, our network speed is the fastest across all 22 administrative districts in Taiwan. Our 
network quality has been unanimously commended by domestic and international mobile analytics organizations, including OpenSignal 
(“top 4G download speed” and “best overall download speed”) and Speedtest (“fastest mobile Internet speed in Taiwan”). As always, 
customer satisfaction is our top priority. We will continue to improve our mobile network to provide customers with top-notch services. To 
ensure the equal sharing of information, in addition to a positive strengthening of mobile Internet quality in populous metropolitan areas, 
we have paid more attention to signal coverage in remote areas. We have achieved 100% total 4G coverage in all towns, and continue to go 
deep into the mountain areas and off-shore islands. Of the 747 remote villages and areas in Taiwan, 736 have 4G L TE coverage.
To promote equal digital rights, we support the “DIGI+ Program” initiative introduced by the Executive Yuan. We plan to increase 1Gbps 
network coverage to 90% by 2020, 2Gbps network coverage to 90% by 2025. Providing ultra-broadband Internet in remote areas is a 
means to balance urban-rural development, encouraging innovation in the digital economy, creating added value in the industry, and, in 
turn, stimulating overall economic growth. In 2018, we invested NT$  200  million in 116 network improvement projects, and the following 
projects were successfully completed: 1Gbps network speed across all townships, 100 Mbps across all villages, increasing Wi-Fi hotspot 
bandwidths, improving 4G cell towers in rural areas, etc.Total Coverage of Free 4G Telecommunication in Remote Areas
In efforts to minimize the impact of disasters by prompt messaging, the Chunghwa Telecom self-developed “Emergency 
Response SMS System” sent out more than 140,000  SMS alerts in 2018. The role of this service in disaster prevention 
and notification was outstanding. In addition, a “Public Warning System” (PWS) has been established to support 
the national policy of emergency message dissemination about typhoons, earthquakes, thunderstorms, landslides, 
roadblocks, reservoir flooding or an outbreak of disease, fast and correctly to specific regions simultaneously. As long 
as a mobile phone is open to the PWS function all our 3G and 4G customers will receive messages about disasters. 
In 2018, we provided technological assistance for the government on multiple occasions: New Taipei City Government ’s 
and Hsinchu County Government’s “All-out Defense Mobilization Drills,” Directorate General of Highways” “Traffic 
Conditions Alert System,” and Atomic Energy Council’s periodic “Nuclear Safety Drills”—all using the “Wireless 
Emergency Alerts” system to notify citizens in designated areas, significantly improving the general public’s awareness 
of disasters and disaster response measures. In addition, we used the “PWS cell broadcast” system for the first time to 
help the government disseminate information on prevalent animal/plant diseases and hazardous air quality.Disaster Report and Upgraded Safety Chunghwa Telecom continues to install repeaters, backup wireless routers, and backup power supplies to increase reliable 
transmission capacity in remote areas. By increasing the capacity of backup batteries to more than  72 hours, the Company 
ensures that residents in remote locations can stay connected even when main power has been disrupted by a natural disaster.Enhanced Disaster Response and Communication Coverage
Item Description
Responses 
MeasureWe conduct annual emergency drills for a wide number of different events, from the coordination of network resources and equipment 
to emergency repairs. Our base stations have been deployed in a diversified manner and are covered by robust backup plans so that 
failure of circuitry, power or equipment at any base station will not disrupt the operation of other nearby base stations.
Occurrence of 
DisasterIf communication is severely disrupted in the unfortunate event of a natural disaster, we take contingency measures, that depends 
on the actual circumstances, to maintain communication between the disaster locations and the outside world. These can include 
microwave radio, satellite transmission, portable base stations, etc.
Special CasesAreas that are enclosed and accessible only through one road, such as on the Suhua Highway, are covered using multiple base stations 
so that even if one station were to be damaged in a natural disaster, other paired stations may still function to maintain contact with 
the area by phone.89

In compliance with regulations set forth by the National Communications Commission (NCC), CHT 
discloses major service interruptions and subsequent response measures on its website. In 2018, one 
major interruption occurred, which is summarized and analyzed below:
1. Description of the interruption: NGN equipment in Taipei S2 district malfunctioned, causing 
network congestion for 40,000 SIP users hosted on the IMS-1 system.
2. Reason for the interruption:
• Outdated IMS equipment led to poor performance.
• Core equipment malfunctioned, causing inability to respond to requests. This was accompanied by repeated 
reissuance of requests by the SVG module, eventually resulting in system overload.
3. Improvement measures: 
• Adjusting parameters of 200  SVG modules—reducing the limit of simultaneous requests from 30 to 10, and increasing 
the keepalive (KA) interval from 10 minutes to 60 minutes.
• Transferring SVG modules into the newly built Taoyuan Fuguo and Taichung Lixing NGN-IMS plants—Due to the large 
amount of enterprise clients using IP Centrex, the transfer was implemented in two stages.
• Taoyuan Fuguo and Taichung Lixing NGN-IMS plants can host more than 300,000 individual and enterprise clients. 
They are equipped with resource monitoring modules, system analytics logs, and bandwidth monitoring mechanisms, 
allowing us to closely monitor system performance.
4. Implementation status:
• Heterogeneous network redundancy—adjusting the routing of TS network switches, based on the demand of 
enterprise clients, to better utilize idle network resources.
• Establish a cross-departmental task force to review current system maintenance procedures and map out future 
improvement plans based on the development of NGN-IMS technology.
5. Outcomes:
• Average annual interruption frequency lowered from 0.0130 per user in 2017 to 0.0016  per user in 2018.
• Average annual interruption duration lowered from 1.5 minutes in 2017 to 0.63  minutes in 2018.Major Service Interruptions in 2018 and Countermeasures2018 Hualien Earthquake Relief Operations
The 2018 Hualien Earthquake brought massive destruction to the area, causing multiple buildings to collapse. 
After the earthquake, CHT immediately established an emergency response center, deploying a fleet of “Cell-
on-Wheels (COW)” trucks while diverting all our resources into restoring cellular service to the region so that 
earthquake victims can get in touch with their families.
CHT firmly believes in the power of “paying it forward.” Not only did we donate NT$ 10 million to the victims to 
help them through the darkest moments of their lives, we also worked with charitable organizations (Chinese 
Christian Relief Association and World Vision Taiwan) to accept donations by text message. All proceeds went into 
the earthquake relief mission.
Furthermore, we provided victims with three months of free 
cellular services. All outstanding bills were given a grace period 
of three months. Qualifying victims were also offered a NT$ 1,000 
discounts on new mobile devices. Affected households classified 
as victims by the government were exempt from any charges 
related to landline services, broadband services, and MOD 
services (including subscription fees and add-on purchases) from 
February 7 onwards until the household applies for reinstallation. 
Other affected households were exempt from all charges until 
regular service resumed.

According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and related scientific research, exposure to 
base stations and Wi-Fi signals does not affect human health. For this issue, Chunghwa Telecom ensures strict 
compliance with the authority ’s safety standards when constructing telecom infrastructure. The Specific 
Absorption Rate (SAR) of all mobile communication products we purchased have complied with the restrictions 
of the National Communications Commission (NCC). 
Given the scarcity of suitable base station locations and the need to assure consumer rights to quality 
communication, we will strive to comply with regulations by taking the approved precautions at all stages of 
installation. In 2018, Chunghwa Telecom incurred NT$ 6.5 million in fines and administrative penalties on 13 
counts of violations associated with base stations. These violations occurred as we sought to address consumer 
demand for “good reception” and concern towards “negative health impacts from base stations.”
The measurement of the electromagnetic radiation in the environment conforms to the standard of the International 
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), which must be lower than 0.45 μW/cm2 at 900MHz and 
less than 0.9μW/cm2 at 1,800MHz. Any resident who has concerns regarding base stations near their home can request 
a free complimentary measurement of the strength of the nearby electromagnetic waves by calling 0800-580-010.The Alleviation of Public Concern about Electromagnetic Waves
Chunghwa Telecom has been working closely with the 
Taiwan Telecom Industry Development Association 
to convey to the public the correct information about 
electromagnetic waves, by organizing conferences and 
issuing promotional materials.
• The Company joined NCC and 14 county/city governments 
nationwide in hosting 15 seminars on the topic of electromagnetic 
waves and 149 free complimentary electromagnetic wave 
measurements have been completed to date.
• Local government bodies were issued some promotional material 
and pamphlets about electromagnetic radiation, which were 
distributed to the public during various activities to promote 
proper understanding.Advocate the Accurate Understanding of

Chunghwa Telecom Banqiao IDC center is the  first  international IDC in the Greater China Region that 
acquired the “TIA-942 Rated 4” certification. It adopts our self-developed, integrative “Smart Home and 
Architecture Platform,” which includes the “Smart Architecture Platform,” “Smart Home Service,” and 
“Facility and Property Management.” The system, which interlocks with its subsystems, helps to create 
centralized monitoring and management of the sub-systems in this center. Managers on-site and users 
can therefore enjoy the convenience of a centralized automatic monitoring system, which keeps up 
with the current trends of smart architecture and helps to realize safety, health, convenience, comfort, 
energy-saving and sustainability goals.Chunghwa Telecom has actively responded to 
the government’s policy to promote renewable 
energy. Our solar power plant tops  the industry 
in capacity, with those installed in our own 
facilities further excelling in scale. The Banqiao 
IDC was awarded the Gold Prize in Systems and 
Silver Prize in Design at the 2018 APIGBA Awards. 
Being the only participant to win two prizes, we 
were recognized for our persistence and hard 
work in pursuing environmental sustainability.The Banqiao IDC Was Awarded Two Awards at the 2018 APIGBA Awards
Following the establishment of the Banqiao IDC, we plan to build a new IDC in Neihu, due to demand 
from international technology companies. The center is expected to accommodate 7,000  server 
cabinets; the total investment is expected to total NT$ 7-10  billion. This IDC will be our largest IDC in 
terms of server cabinet numbers as well as the largest individual IDC in Taiwan.

Green Operations1G
Chunghwa Telecom has set themselves a goal to become a sustainable “Green enterprise,” and has made 
environmental issues an incorporated part of business operation and management. We hope to play a more 
proactive role in issues such as energy and climate change. By improving energy efficiency and exploring 
eco-friendly products and services, we are confident of our potential to inspire a new generation of low-
carbon industries.
We developed the Environment ARtificer THeurgy (EARTH) system in 2008 to manage resources and protect 
the environment more efficiently as well as to reduce spending on energy consumption.EARTH system features 
include:
Chunghwa Telecom Hostels provide accommodation for employee business or leisure travel. In response to 
environmental protection and personal hygiene, the hostels do not provide disposable, or consumable items 
or towels. They also take energy-saving measures such as solar water heating, air conditioning using heat 
pumps and LED lighting.  19 hostels had been certified as Environmentally Friendly Accommodation by 2018.
Chunghwa Telecom hopes to provide eco-tours that are both educational and entertaining for our employees, 
so that they understand concepts of extreme weather, responsible tourism, respect for nature and the rights of 
local residents. We hold regular company eco-tours with the hopes of incorporating environmental education 
into traveling and daily life. We held 93 tours in 2018, costing a total of NT$ 86,015  thousand with  17,959  
participants.Environment ARtificer THeurgy (EARTH)

Chunghwa Telecom has sought to take advantage of the business opportunities in green energy and won the contracts 
for the construction of solar power plants for Taiwan Power Company, Taiwan Cement Corporation, as well as many 
other private companies; with said power plants reaching 150 MW in total capacity and are expected to contribute NT$ 7-
8 billion to Chunghwa Telecom ’s solar power revenue. In 2017, we undertook Taiwan Power Company ’s solar power 
plant construction project in Changhua Coastal Park, which saw full power supply commencing at the beginning of 2019 
– this has become a milestone in Chunghwa Telecom ’s foray in the solar power field.
We currently have two construction projects: one is commissioned by a subsidiary of Taiwan Cement Corporation and 
the other by Taiwan Power Company. The former entails the construction of a ground-mounted solar station with a 
capacity of 12 MW, and this is currently the biggest contracting project for a solar power plant taken on by a private 
company. The latter outsourced the first stage of the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to us.
The smart energy service used in conjunction with the Internet of things can both save and store energy by storing wind or 
solar power generated during the off-peak period.  Big data analytics and billing services allow customers to use energy saved 
from the off-peak period during the peak period, a method that effectively allocates and saves energy, thus reducing cost.Seizing the Opportunities of Green Energy Business
Renewable energy usage in IDC in BanqiaoEnergy Savings for Data CentersGreen Energy 2G
Chunghwa Telecom has been positively supporting the government policy and applying its extensive ICT 
background knowledge in the construction of solar power stations. By the end of 2018, the Company had 70 
solar power stations around Taiwan with a total capacity of  672  kWp.
Chunghwa Telecom places great emphasis on the energy efficiency of our data centers, and is currently 
implementing energy conservation measures for telecom data centers (including IDCs). The efficient 
application of our proprietary iEN smart energy management system is our scientific approach to reducing 
energy, carbon emission and protection of the environment.Electricity Consumption Analysis

Water usage at Chunghwa Telecom is mostly domestic. Apart from bathroom use, air conditioner cooling accounts 
for another major water use. Given the ongoing increase in business activities and manpower, there is limited room 
for water reduction besides the recovery of rainwater and cooling water.
We benchmarked the 2012 water usage as the standard, and now control the annual growth of water usage to no 
more than 2%. In addition to a new water leakage detection feature in products, we have also included Company 
water consumption in the EARTH system. Centralized water bill payment is done through the EARTH “water bill 
management” function to reduce the printing of water bills. Managers can use the system to search, generate trend 
charts and report forms, and provide exception reports to avoid mistakes in billing and meter reading. Managers 
can also review the situation of water usage according to trend charts and reports, reduce expenses in water, and 
improve the efficiency of management.
The management and analysis information interface can be used to promote water conservation measures and set 
concrete management goals. We also promote water-saving measures to increase efficiency in water use:
1. Install sink faucet sprayers to reduce waste
2. Install dual flush toilets to reduce waste
3. Use collected rainwater for watering office plants
4. Encourage the installation of water reclamation equipment in new buildings, so that physically 
separated and treated sewage water can be reused for non-potable purposes after it has reached a 
certain quality standard
To enhance the effectiveness of water recycling and reuse, we have set up raft foundation water 
collection systems underground to collect clean rainwater from rooftops and the ground surface. 
We have also initiated the recycling of cooled and condensed water from office air-conditioners 
and promoted a recycling and reuse plan for rainwater, bathwater and air conditioner water. The 
recycled water is reused for watering plants and cleaning sidewalks.
To keep track of water risks at Chunghwa Telecom and to respond to Goal 6 “Clean 
water and sanitation” of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we’ve 
implemented the Water Footprint Project, and plan to exam the water footprint in 
Banqiao IDC machine rooms in 2019, becoming certified for SGS-Taiwan ISO 14046. 
Expected benefits include:
1. Established strategies for water management: effectively manage water 
resources through establishing a standard operating procedure concerning 
our water footprint.
2. Strengthened water consumption management: through the implementation 
of a water footprint inventory, we can effectively keep track of the virtual 
water distribution inside our company, which allows us to establish a sound 
water management system as well as come up with appropriate measures to 
achieve the goal of water conservation.Water Resource Management

Chunghwa Telecom understands the importance of resources reduction, recycling and reuse and has 
combined a five-year environmental sustainability development plan with the EARTH system. This is used 
to manage the use of resources and control energy efficiency, as well as to conduct systematic management 
of recyclables and waste treatment. We contracted a professional waste treatment company to transport 
our daily waste to landfills or incinerators for disposal. Recyclable waste is handled by a contracted cleaning 
company that is responsible for classification, treatment and proper disposal.Waste Management
Scrapped lead-acid batteries are recyclable industrial waste regulated by the EPA. Business organizations are 
responsible for the reduction of pollution, disposal of toxic substances and simple waste disposal. All recycling 
and disposal operations are outsourced by joint contract based on the public auction. The contractor must 
be a qualified service provider listed on the website of the Recycling Fund Management Board of the EPA to 
ensure legitimate management and disposal and to reduce environmental impact.
Scrapped lead-acid batteries from each business unit are auctioned on site, and the “Announcement and 
Delivery Slip for Removal and Disposal of Waste Lead-Acid Batteries” is retained for reference. The gradual 
rise in raw material prices has also caused the recycling and reuse value of scrapped lead-acid batteries 
to increase. A total of 50,963  lead-acid batteries with a total weight of  3,294,691  kg were scrapped and 
sold for NT$ 58,816 thousand in 2018. In fulfilling our responsibility for environmental protection, we also 
increased Company revenue. The public and private waste clearance and disposal companies recognized by 
environmental institutions are designated to handle the treatment of other industrial waste such as cables 
and miscellaneous hardware.Industrial WasteYear 2016 2017 2018

Green Stores3G
Chunghwa Telecom is a highly-localized telecom carrier, a generous contributor to community development, and one of the 
most important partners to other telecom carriers around the world. As technologies progressed and improved, we began 
some operations that were outside the conventional telecom boundaries, “corporate social responsibility” concepts were 
introduced into products and services research, development, applications, and into the Company management strategies.
In addition to developing products that are friendly to the environment, we have been promoting Green 
Stores and were the first  telecom carrier in Taiwan to fully turn service centers into Green Stores. Customers 
are encouraged to purchase green products from our “Chunghwa Telecom Green Stores.” In 2018, green 
revenue was NT$ 803.9 million, which was 0.48 % of the total revenue.Green Revenue
The Company has had a cross-industry alliance with China Motors since 2016 to promote the “e-Moving 
electric vehicle/bicycle” preferential plan at all branches. All Chunghwa Telecom indoor phone or 
broadband customers can select and purchase e-moving products at the direct branches. By 2018 we 
had sold 1,371  e-moving vehicles and sales performance in cross-industry marketing was good.Good Results in Cross-Industry Marketing
Since the second half of 2018, we’ve implemented the SMS billing system, where customers can pay or view their 
bills anywhere and at any time by verifying their identity through the use of one-time passwords (OTP) or their ID 
cards; this convenient and eco-friendly service has garnered praise from almost 2 million users.
The verifying process through use of an ID card can be done by verifying their ID number, which allows users to 
easily acquire a barcode for the account they’d like to pay for; having acquired the barcode, they can pay at any 
of our service locations, and also include Senao International, 7-11, FamilyMart, Hi-Life, and OK Mart, simply by 
presenting the barcode. If it isn’t convenient for a user to visit such a location, he or she can tap on “Amount Due” 
on the barcode page and proceed with the payment online. Chunghwa Telecom’s Text BillingWe have been promoting the use of electronic billing since 2001 to conserve energy, and reduce carbon 
emission by eliminating the use of paper for bills. In 2017, we offered the “paperless receipt service” to satisfy 
customer need and also contribute to a reduction of global warming. As of the end of 2018, the percentage 
of paperless receipts exceeded 68%. The service saved 568  million sheets of paper and an estimated 50,973  
trees, it had also reduced carbon emission by 10,093 metric tons by the end of 2018.Paperless Receipt Service

1. From 2017 onwards, the calculation is based on the quantity of paper saved and reduction of carbon emission by the 
use of e-bills, combined bills and paperless receipts.
2. The elimination of each bill saves 2.5 sheets of printed A4 paper and an envelope. Total amount of paper saved: the 
quantity of paper saved (thousand)×2.5×12 (month)
3. One sheet of A4 paper generates 18 grams of CO 2; the amount of carbon emission reduced: the quantity of paper 
saved (1,000 sheets)×18 grams
4. The number of trees saved: For each ton of paper pulp produced, 20 trees are felled; one ton of paper pulp produces 
220 thousand sheets of A4 paper. Therefore, the number of trees saved = the quantity of paper saved÷22×20.100

Chunghwa Telecom supports government policy and prepares annual budgets for the purchase of green 
products that are either environmental-certified (less polluting, recyclable, resource-saving or green building 
material) or self-declared to be of less environmental impact throughout the product lifecycle (from raw material 
to disposal). The Company also actively participates in green procurement programs and activities to inspire 
green purchases amongst others in the industry and the public.
Our goals and policies concerning green procurement have been explained in detail in the five-year plan 
mentioned above. We hope to maintain green purchases at more than 5% of the total purchases per year over 
the mid-term, and increase this percentage to more than 50% over the long term. To achieve this goal, we 
incorporated the ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement Standard at the end of 2018. The implementation of the 
ISO management system helped reinforce the idea of green procurement.Green Supply Chain4G
Green Procurement5GThe responsibilities and mission of Chunghwa Telecom, as the leader of the telecom industry are “Green of 
ICT and Green by ICT .” This implies facilitation of the greenness of the ICT industry (Green of ICT) and overall 
greenness of society through ICT (Green by ICT). From 2008 onwards, Chunghwa Telecom developed measures 
year by year to improve the sustainability of the supply chain, and in 2018 we accomplished two pioneering 
achievements:
Future green supply chains will entail more than just supplier commitment to environmental protection and the 
life cycle of green products. Chunghwa Telecom will continue to explore value-added applications of ICT , and 
introduce robust systems to facilitate better coordination and management, as well as complete monitoring of 
the supply chain.

We were the  first  telecom company to propose the “Sustainable Supply Chain Initiative,”
effectively connecting with internationally prominent sustainability organizations and partners, also connecting the supply 
chain to respond to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
We were first  in the industry to join the “CDP Supply Chain Project”
to strengthen, integrate and analyze greenhouse gas emission by suppliers using the CDP platform to ensure carbon 
management information transparency in the Chunghwa Telecom supply chain. We invited 100 suppliers to participate 
in an international platform to submit carbon management information and improve their ability in managing carbon 
emissions with scientific and quantification mechanisms.101

Every year Chunghwa Telecom purchases the software, hardware and services necessary for operations from 
international and domestic suppliers. This includes networking and data equipment, cables, marketing, 
design and waste disposal services. Our enormous purchasing power gives us a profound influence over the 
supply chain, hence the responsibility to guide our suppliers in the fulfillment of their CSR. This is achieved 
by implementing conduct that complies with the international ESG supply chain regulations to guide the ICT 
industry towards sustainability.
We were the  first  telecom enterprise in Taiwan to join the CDP Supply Chain Project in 2017 when the industry was 
confronted by the critical issues of global climate change and its effect on corporate development. In 2018, we again 
became the first  telecom company to incorporate the ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement Standard. We strive to 
establish a better connection to the world on our path towards the development of sustainability.
From earlier on we have encouraged suppliers to disclose their carbon emissions and reduce them gradually. 
We plan to incorporate “low-carbon emissions” into our tender regulations: only groups with carbon 
emissions under a certain level can participate in our tendering process. Through sustainable planning, 
supplier evaluation and a green supply chain constructed on a hierarchical management system, we hope to 
achieve the following goals of sustainability: environmental protection, effective operations and management, 
robust labor rights, as well as safety and sanitation.Sustainable Supply Chain
Chunghwa Telecom upholds its company motto and its mission 
as a Digital Economy Motivator and a Creative Industry Pilot, 
formally adopting the ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement 
Standard to evaluate our suppliers’ performance in sustainability.
We’ve finished planning for the “Sustainable Partner 
Certification,” which consists of 4 tiers, “Gold, Silver, Bronze 
and Participation.” We examine suppliers’ SGS second party 
audit results based on their type and level of importance, and 
rate them accordingly. If a supplier fails to pass the certification 
process, it is granted a limited period of time to implement 
corrective measures. Rated suppliers shall receive a mark 
that corresponds to their rating, and this mark will be seen as 
favorable when submitting a tender.
We hope to compile a “Chunghwa Telecom Sustainable Supply 
Chain” list through evaluation, training, audit and certification; 
we’ d also like to lead our suppliers toward a sustainable future, 
improve the sustainability of telecom companies, business, and 
society as a whole, as well as keep abreast with the international 
trends of low-carbon economy.CHT’s Sustainable Supply Chain Initiative—Sustainable Partner Certification

The Chunghwa Telecom suppliers fall into three categories: property, labor and engineering. Apart from 
professional network communications equipment which is mainly purchased overseas, we buy as much from 
local suppliers as possible to promote local economic development. The domestic procurement percentage was 
90% in 2018. Our target is to reach 95% by 2023.
Suppliers AnalysisWe promote corporate social responsibilities on two levels. (1) For new suppliers just starting to learn about 
corporate social responsibilities, we offer encouragement, education and support during their development of 
the proper awareness for CSR. (2) For established suppliers who are fully aware of the need for CSR, we conduct 
third-party audits, issue online CSR questionnaires, organize conferences, and launch sustainability campaigns 
as means to engage them in a winning relationship.ESG Management Supply Chain Strategy

We published “Code of Corporate Social Responsibility for Suppliers of Chunghwa Telecom Co Ltd” in 2011, 
and it clearly outlines the Company’s expectations in terms of “business, ethics, labor, environment, safety, 
and health.” The guidelines apply to all suppliers that provide products or services to Chunghwa Telecom or 
its subsidiaries or joint ventures, and extend to other participants of the supply chain to which the supplier is 
directly or indirectly related. We hope that suppliers will commit to our values and take more proactive steps 
towards maintaining a sustainable business relationship.
CHT shares resources with suppliers to help them develop R&D capabilities and future technologies. We 
also devote ourselves to the creation of a friendly and innovative environment. We engage suppliers in R&D 
projects, reward their contributions, and make arrangements for the transfer of acquired technology and 
licenses fairly. Regarding hardware, we continue to support the development of telecom facilities and testing 
environments; in terms of software, we utilize open platforms to share our benefits with suppliers.Mutual Benefits with Business Partners
Type Description
Rewards top-
performing suppliersTo reward top-performing suppliers, Chunghwa Telecom conducted a trial in southern 
Taiwan, offering qualified suppliers the privilege of “tender bond waiver when 
submitting tenders, as well as a reduction of the performance bond to 5% of the value of 
the contract won.” This was an attempt to exert influence as an industry leader and bring 
more attention to corporate social responsibility.
Training of 
professional skillsOur Telecom Training Institute has been providing suppliers with relevant training and 
certification courses to satisfy their requirements. Some of the popular courses include: 
cabling contractor certification, telecom line construction quality assurance certification, 
and fiber optic contractor training. In 2018, the institute organized 34 classes and trained 
738  workers; 318  of whom had obtained certification.

CSR On-Site Audits and Capacity Promotion
After “The Paris Agreement” took effect, we entered an age of low-carbon economy. Chunghwa Telecom is a carrier in the 
information and communications industry, and this is a crucial issue of great urgency. We need to understand and respond 
to the impact of climate change and plan appropriate response strategies and actions at once.
We made Climate Change the main theme of our supplier CSR Interchange Meeting in 2017. We invited a CDP representative 
and people from advanced domestic enterprises with forward-looking carbon management to share how to identify risks 
and opportunities brought by the climate change issue. We also formally activated and announced our membership of the 
“Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Project.” We are promoting an understanding of climate change among our 
suppliers and will make every effort to increase their efficiency in carbon management. CHT is putting an encouragement 
mechanism in place that will help suppliers with the research and development of products and services that have less 
impact on climate and the environment. Our three goals for the supply chain carbon management are:
1. Increase supplier awareness and knowledge of climate change
2. Collect greenhouse gas emission information
3. Communicate and encourage changes in the behavior of suppliersThe Guidance of Supply Chain Partners in a Response to Climate ChangeCHT Management Indicator Method Ratio

1 supplier on-site audits since 2010 in accordance with ESG supply chain principles drafted by Chunghwa Telecom. 
Their existing occupational safety and health provisions resulted in an on-site audit rate of 97.26 % in 2018.
We have planned to increase the number of suppliers that receive the SGS-Taiwan on-site audit to 20 and to add 
a review session.We have undertaken to insist on an audit rate of 100 % in our critical tier 1 supplier ESG on-site 
audits so that all our supply chain partners will be in compliance with ESG management requirements before 2023. 
Our goal is to complete the sustainability classification of 170  suppliers and issue the certification mark by 2025.

Chunghwa Telecom “5I SDGs” Initiative
As the pilot of CSR, Chunghwa Telecom has developed its core competence to 
positively minimize the digital divide and devote itself to the creation of digital 
opportunities. Since 2015, we have chosen to connect with the 2030 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Through real action we have 
demonstrated our determination to develop and implement global sustainability.
In 2017, we promoted the “5I SDGs” initiative: “I Helping, I Sharing, I Learning, I 
Technology and I Protecting,” as the  first real initiative in Taiwan that connects 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the “Digital Country Innovative 
Economy Development Program” (DIGI＋) from the Executive Yuan. Expanding 
partnerships in collaboration with NPO/NGO, helped us support the sharing of 
knowledge and technology resources. This enabled us to create a connection 
between the underprivileged and other diverse groups in this digital era. 
Technology allows us to link to the good cycle and realize a win-win situation 
for digital human rights and an innovative economy at the same time.Win-win-win is beneficial to the implementation 
of CSR; beneficial to the digital economy and 
beneficial to global sustainability development 
by connection with SDGs.Spirit
To construct a digital inclusion society, we use ICT 
technology as an instrument and corporate volunteers 
as the point to go deep into Taiwan communities to 
promote and popularize establishments. We also 
increase social innovation and information equality 
through R&D innovation and actual practices as well.Vision
Using service popularization, ICT technology R&D 
and corporate volunteers, we will complete the 
following goals:
• To promote and popularize service establishments 
and provide accessible and sufficient service support
• Cultivate digital information literacy in all groups
• R&D or purchase information assistance measures 
for the underprivilegedGoal
The CHT Eco-Service Group was established in 2018. Their volunteer members are specialized in 
fields such as electrical engineering, air conditioning, and illumination; moreover, they’re equipped 
with innovation and integration capabilities in information and communications technology. They 
not only share their experiences in voluntary energy conservation and emission reduction with the 
public, but also provide government agencies and communities in need with free electricity and air 
conditioning evaluation and inspection services so as to improve the efficiency of energy use and 
extend the service life of related equipment. In 2018, the Eco-Service Group was mobilized twice to 
perform energy efficiency diagnostics at Kung Nan San Village in Taipei and Tien Chiao Community in 
Keelung. In addition to echoing the Environmental Protection Administration’s policy of “Low-Carbon 
Communities and Energy-Saving Services” these highly efficient energy-saving measures also reduce 
electricity bills, thus aiding in reaching the “I Protecting” goals contained in the “5I SDGs” initiative!I Protecting—Eco-Service Group in Local Communities

360 Degree of digital Inclusion Actions
Chunghwa Telecom focuses its social investment in “minimizing the digital divide” and the “creating of digital 
opportunities,” given the specific nature and the core competence of information and communication in the 
ICT industry. We also spare no effort in the advocacy of “corporate volunteers” to participate in local community 
services, and proactively assist the communities in creating digital opportunities. We promote all aspects of 
digital inclusion using 360-degree vision.
In 2018 Chunghwa Telecom established 35 sites for accessibility to telecom services in long-term support of a 
government initiative to protect fundamental rights to communications.
Chunghwa Telecom refers to the community 
investment evaluation mechanism of the LBG 
(London Benchmark Group), to conduct evaluations 
on the possible community social benefits and 
business opportunities before an investment is made.
The quantification of the contribution of social 
investment allows us to make reasonable resources 
allocation, while avoiding repetition. It helps the 
decision-making and promotion of charities as well 
as future sponsorship.Social Investment Management

To minimize the digital divide between cities and counties, the Chunghwa Telecom Foundation started the “Digital Good 
Neighbors” program 12 years ago. CHT combines the core profession, help building a digital learning environment, and 
bring broadband to the end of the pipeline, thus creating digital popularity and benefits for the communities.  
The Chunghwa Telecom Foundation as a resource platform goes into the community tribes and promote digital 
applications with local organizations. We also provides program resources according to local need, these include digital 
training courses, youth volunteer events, art and reading activities, CHT Women’s Basketball, industrial assistance, 
recorded video learning and more. Up to the end of 2018, we were cooperating with 85 different NGOs and our tracks 
were all over Taiwan, including northern, central , southern Taiwan and the surrounding islands.
In October 2018, the Chunghwa Telecom Foundation collaborated with Pintung County Government in holding the 
“Digital Good Neighbor Information Session” and invited 10 communities to join, with the farthest one from the 
Hengchun Peninsula. This joint effort of private institutions and the government has helped to produce the best possible 
results utilizing limited resources and aided in bridging the urban-rural divide in digital exposure and resources.Chunghwa Telecom Foundation was founded in 2006. Starting with implementing corporate social responsibility, and 
through long-term cultivation of our core competence to communities, tribes, urban fringe, and areas with relatively 
lack of resources, the Foundation is a resource platform for connecting and arranging the “good” material, and further 
share to needed locations. It has become the strength that supports and assists the advancement of these local areas.Minimizing the Digital Divide
The Chunghwa Telecom Foundation－The Digital Good Neighbors
To encourage the usage of digital tools, Chunghwa Telecom Foundation held 
the “Little Environmental Directors” video-making course at Little Liuqiu (Liuqiu 
Island), a day before the World Earth Day; the participants were 36 local students 
with an average age of under 13. In addition to learning about environmental 
issues such as protection, they produced 6 videos on tablets after being taught a 
range of skills including video filming, editing and post-processing. Using imagery 
in this way, to speak on behalf of the environment, has helped the concept of 
environmental protection take root in young students.
The student-produced videos were played in the passenger waiting room in 
Donggang, the Visitor Center, and onboard the ferries; the hope is to amplify the 
effect of the event so that tourists and residents of Little Liuqiu can better address 
issues regarding local environmental protections. These videos promoted the idea 
of “reducing plastic waste while traveling, leading an eco-friendly life” to locals 
and tourists alike. The Foundation also drew on the experience of this successful 
event and continued taking steps to amplify its influence.1. We helped the Environmental Protection 
Bureau of Pingtung County to hold 
the course at Linbian Elementary 
School (Linbian Township) and Shengli 
Elementary School (Pingtung City), 
tutoring 108  students in total and thus 
expanding the effect of the course in 
Little Liuqiu.

By utilizing our expertise in telecom technology, we will ensure that everyone shares the advantage of 
technology despite financial or social standing, or geographical location. In this way we hope to quickly 
achieve the objective of minimizing the digital divide and creating digital opportunity. In addition to previously 
described action plans and subsidy, different from those of other enterprises, we also contributed resources to 
developing related products and services to meet the needs of the disabled and allow them to realize their right 
of access to the digital technology universe.
The 2018 “Click Taiwan” program received 310  applications from 147  departments in 61 universities 
nationwide. 56 students were selected to perform services and capture stories at 26 Digital Good Neighbors in 
remote areas. These students came from different backgrounds, schools and departments, and had devoted 
themselves to community services by contributing their own specialties. This included the creation of stories, 
games designed for grandparent-grandchild interaction, production assistance with video material advertising 
tribal tours, the promotion of oral hygiene, event recording, graffiti art and photography courses. They 
captured real motivating stories with their cameras. To encourage more youth participation and get a better 
effect, we held photography exhibition excursions through the campuses of different colleges nationwide to 
share theme videos within school courses.The Creation of Digital Opportunities

The foundation cooperated with the Department of Radio & Television of National Chengchi University 
in 2009 in “Click Taiwan.” During the summer vacation, college students spent 15-20 days as a 
“Digital Good Neighbor” to “provide and document services” ; they would use their skills to help the 
local community and record videos of local stories. This project encourages young people to make 
changes, challenge the norm, gain new experiences, and get to know themselves and the land through 
participating in different activities. The program entered its tenth year in 2018.
To get a more precise analysis of the benefits, which could be used as reference for future improvement, 
we used the Social Return on Invest (SROI) to examine the project by looking at its effects and further 
calculated and analyzed the real social impact of 2018 “Click Taiwan.”
Through a comprehensive analysis, we’ve found that an investment of just NT$ 1 can return NT$ 3.04  
worth of social benefits. This calculation included expenses such as the cost of the 2018 project to the 
Foundation and the college students’ service hours. According to our calculations, this project had a 
measurable impact on the participating students and the communities.
Through SROI calculations, we hope to understand the benefits of the “Click Taiwan” program, collect 
its data and the assess the impact it’s brought to Taiwan. We also hope to refine the direction and 
implementation of the project based on this analysis. In the future, we will introduce SROI to other 
projects so that when we implement relevant projects and events, we will have a more comprehensive 
understanding of the impact brought to society as well as the value and benefits of the CSR project; and 
in so doing create a more harmonious Taiwanese society.The Social Return on Investment (SROI) of “Click Taiwan”
The program entered its tenth year in 2018, and through a long process of hard work, we saw how college 
students and communities interacted with each other and grew together; we also observed an increasing 
number of new immigrants bringing new energy to Taiwan. At this 10-year milestone, we hoped to extend 
the spirit of “Click Taiwan” to this group of new immigrants. Through participating in this program, second 
generation immigrants were able to gain a deeper understanding of their mothers’ native cultures and 
would understand the advantage of having two different cultural backgrounds, which we hope will help new 
immigrants and their children to integrate into the Taiwanese society.
Vietnamese immigrants are the majority among Southeast Asian immigrants, and therefore, “Vietnam” was the 
theme for the first “Click Taiwan, Hearty Southbound.” We selected five groups from the ones recommended by 
academic circles and private organizations. Their members included new immigrants, their college-age children, 
and two Taiwanese students. We first launched the program during the winter break of 2018. “Click Taiwan, Hearty Southbound” — Discovering the Value of Your Culture

Having held the program “Click Taiwan” for ten consecutive years, we have 
accumulated many stories from the participants. To spread the word about 
this project, we interviewed 12 previous participants and invited them to share 
how their experiences from this project affected them in terms of their thinking 
and participation in relevant social activities. Through these interviews, we 
hope to outline the value of this project to the younger generation.
To invigorate the economy of communities, the Chunghwa Telecom Foundation continues to help 
communities develop sales channels. In 2018, in addition to utilizing industry expert mentoring, the Chunghwa 
Telecom Foundation collaborated with community residents nationwide, the foundation of community 
businesses, to learn how to develop a green economy through eco-friendly means and increase professional 
expertise. This resulted in the quality of farm produce improving; we also hope it will have the further effect of 
bringing young people back to their communities and create more employment opportunities.
The “Festive Gift” fair is our long-term promotional project for community businesses. We place many orders 
from these businesses every year, which help them to not only expand their brands, but also develop more 
sales channels. At the end of 2018, we helped communities develop 12 businesses, 24 new products and 12 
routes for community trips as ways to support quality local businesses and enhance the visibility of Taiwan.“Youth, Grand Tour”—Reflections from Program Participants

very conscious about bridging the rural-urban divide.”
-Kevin Chen, CEO of ELIV“I believe that programs like “Click Taiwan,” where we learn 
from doing and enjoy the company of our fellow participants’ 
company, can guide us in building confidence, pursuing dreams, 
and believing in ourselves.” -Wei-Wen Li, Writer,

“This learning experience reminded me of my home in the countryside of Thailand. Through 
observation, one could see how nature changed and how trees grew. I learned to document my 
observations and got to know diversity in how one should go about planting, the importance of just 
distribution, as well as organizations that pass on such culture. I’ll apply what I learned here to our 
farmland at home” -Lily, new immigrant in Pingtung“It's a pity if organic farming ends up becoming profit-oriented. I hope that through our persistence 
in practicing the idea of “caring for the Earth, the people, and sharing the surplus,” more people 
will adopt this way of farming and duplicate it in other places. The end of this learning experience 
is the start of taking action” -Shao-Hsing Lin, Yunlin118

We believe “humanity to be the foundation of technology innovation.” In 2013, we launched a 
“Voice-based Personal Assistance App” that was specifically designed for the visually impaired. 
The App incorporates image, voice, reading, and lifestyle functions to assist both visually impaired 
and elders to face some of their difficulties. By the end of 2018, the App had been downloaded 
51,360  times. It is one of the most convenient and useful personal assistants available.
“Senior Citizens App” was the first application developed by Chunghwa Telecom and the Institute 
for Information Industry that addresses the needs of the elderly. The App has several useful features 
including: phone assistance, a contact list, caller announcement, weather inquiry, health reminder, 
emergency contact, photo sharing, and video streaming. This App will make Smartphones and 
Tablets more user-friendly for older people and further minimize the digital divide. In the future, 
there would be an iOS version and push notifications for the latest health information.We take advantage of corporate information and communication 
resources to support the visually impaired. In 2017, we 
collaborated with the Taiwan Telecom Industry Development 
Association to respond to the Suang Lien Foundation promotion 
of “Secondhand iPhones For the Visually Impaired Assistance 
Plan.” In addition to a donation of 50 used phones with Senao 
International, we also provided a free Wi-Fi training classroom for 
the “iPhone Course for the Visually Impaired” to ensure them the 
same opportunities and basic communications rights as others. 
The Chunghwa Telecom corporate volunteer assistance plan 
entered its fifth stage in 2018. The corporate volunteers reset all 
the collected iPhones to “factory setting” status, each visually 
impaired persons who had completed the training was given an 
iPhone.
Chunghwa Telecom has engaged in long-term cooperation with the Resource Center for the Visually Impaired 
at Tamkang University for more than 30 years and the EYE Social Innovative Call Center was set up in 2011. This 
joint effort led to the unveiling of the first “Total Solution” in Taiwan. This includes research and development 
of a computer-assisted telephone system, the improvement and the training and supervision of talent and the 
development of skill in customer phone service personnel who respond to the needs of the visually impaired.
• In 2015, the Company completed an upgrade to the Taipei City 1999 hotline, making it user-friendly to the visually impaired. This upgrade 
included: a real-time notification system, a three-way call feature with voice recording, English/ Japanese services, a verbal abuse referral 
feature, a call duration reminder, a health regulation inquiry feature, and a quick link to service sub-categories. These upgrades greatly 
improved the scope and efficiency of the service.
• By the end of 2018, the “Total Solution” had provided 8 working opportunities for the satisfaction surveyors of Chunghwa Telecom 
(including one visually impaired manager), who are responsible for the production of about 5,000 valid questionnaires each month. There 
were another  15 customer service personnel ( 12 visually impaired and 3 supervisors) for the Taipei City 1999 hotline. 
• We initiated new employment opportunities for persons with spinal injuries. 2 with severe injury serve as 4G visual assistance service 
persons. They assist with image identification for the visually impaired through the 4G cloud services. This helps promote their quality of 
daily life and independence while providing employment opportunities for the severely disabled.
The automated voice system for donations developed by Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories has proved to be helpful 
for charities, social welfare, cultural, educational, and environmental protection institutions. It gives donors a more 
convenient means of donation. A donor simply needs to pick up their cell phones, dial the number, and follow the 
voice prompts to contribute care to those in need. In 2018, there were 6,201 donations, totaling NT$ 3,305,150 .I Helping- Corporate Volunteers Training
