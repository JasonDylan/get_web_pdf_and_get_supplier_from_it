2019 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
THE FUTURE  
IS BRIGHT
1About EQT
CEO Letter
Dear Stakeholders,
On July 10, 2019, EQT’s shareholders voted to elect a new slate of directors — and in turn, appoint a
new leadership team — with a mandate of transforming EQT into a modern, technology-driven and
efficient natural gas producer. Our new board and leadership team have embraced this mandate.
As the largest producer of natural gas in the United States, it is incumbent on EQT to be a leader in the
industry, and as such, we are now embarking on a journey to ensure that we are not just the biggest, but
also the best. EQT has long been a leader in the Appalachian Basin in terms of its dedication to safety ,
preservation of the environment and corporate responsibility. This represents a strong foundation from
which we can evolve towards even more lofty goals.
I am pleased to share EQT’s eighth annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report produced under the
Global Reporting Initiative guidelines. This year’s report theme, The Future is Bright, is a recognition that
the new board and leadership have brought with them a renewed commitment to our shareholders,
landowners, communities and the environment. 
The report outlines our 2018 operational data, environmental disclosures and outreach ef forts. I am proud that our employees were able to
deliver another strong year in these areas, and look forward to building on this foundation in the coming years.
On behalf of EQT, thank you for the opportunity to share our commitment to the responsible development of natural gas and I look forward to
sharing our progress.
Sincerely,
Toby Z. Rice
President and CEO102-14
2ABOUT EQT
Corporate Profile
About EQT
EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) is a Standard and Poor’s 400 investor-owned upstream energy corporation operating in the United States of
America. Founded in the Appalachian Basin and headquartered in Pittsburgh, EQT is proud to be the largest natural gas producer in North
America. Our company’s history demonstrates a longstanding record of integrity, experience, innovation and sustainability in our operations; it
also illustrates that our future is bright.
As a leader in the use of advanced horizontal drilling technology , EQT is committed to minimizing the impact of drilling-related activities and
reducing our overall environmental footprint. By operating safely and responsibly , EQT is helping to meet our nation’s demand for clean-
burning energy, while simultaneously offering a rewarding workplace and support for activities that enrich the communities where our
employees live and work.
With 965 employees as of December 31, 2018, the company generated 2018 total operating revenues of approximately $4.6 billion. EQT
completed the separation of our upstream and midstream businesses on November 12, 2018, with the spinof f of the standalone midstream
company, newly minted Equitrans Midstream Corporation (NYSE: ETRN) (the spin-off). Following the spin-off, EQT became a premier pure
play production company with a renewed focus on upstream operations. At December 31, 2018, EQT held a retained 19.9% equity stake in
ETRN. All discussions in this report reference EQT upstream activities and operations only , collectively disclosed as EQT or EQT Corporation,
unless otherwise specified. For more information about our products (as defined by the Global Reporting Initiative), see Markets and Products.
Significant events for EQT in 2018:
Achieved annual sales volumes of 1,488 Bcfe and average daily sales volumes of 4,076 MMcfe/d (adjusted for the impact of the 2018
divestitures, as explained below: 1,447 Bcfe, or 3,964 MMcfe/d).
Sold non-core Permian Basin assets located in Texas for net proceeds of $56.9 million (the Permian Divestiture) on June 19, 2018. At the
time of sale, assets sold in the Permian Divestiture included approximately 970 productive wells with net production of approximately 20
MMcfe per day, approximately 350 miles of low-pressure gathering lines, and 26 compressors.
Sold approximately 2.5 million non-core, net acres in the Huron play for net proceeds of $523.6 million (the Huron Divestiture and together
with the Permian Divestiture, the 2018 Divestitures) on July 18, 2018. The assets sold in the Huron Divestiture included approximately
12,000 productive wells with current net production of approximately 200 MMcfe per day , approximately 6,400 miles of low-pressure
gathering lines, and 59 compressor stations. EQT retained the deep drilling rights across the divested acreage.
Completed the separation and distribution of Equitrans Midstream Corporation on November 12, 2018.

3ABOUT EQT
Markets and Products
Markets Served
As of December 31, 2018, EQT Corporation was the largest producer of natural gas in North America, with natural gas production operations
focused in the Appalachian Basin. EQT produces natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) sold as a commodity to marketers, utilities, power
generators and industrial customers in the Appalachian Basin and markets that are accessible through the company’ s current transportation
portfolio, which includes markets in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast. As a technology-driven leader in advanced horizontal drilling, our
ability to drill long laterals from large pads in some of the most productive areas in the world gives us one of the lowest cost structures in the
natural gas industry, while consistently working safely and responsibly to minimize impacts to the environment.
The natural gas supply chain, from discovery to market delivery, is a complex series of activities. For end-users to receive natural gas or
natural gas-derived products, the resource must first be identified and produced. EQT Corporation has investments within this phase of the
supply chain, including drilling, completion, pumping and gas field service providers, casings for drilling and information technology products.
In 2018, EQT spent approximately $2.99 billion with more than 2,500 suppliers. Of our total spend, nearly 82.5% was spent inside of EQT’ s
operational footprint while the remaining 17.5% went to suppliers outside of our operating area. According to PowerAdvocate’ s Oil and Gas
Upstream model, the upstream oil and gas industry is approximately 30% labor intensive. See Indirect Economic Impacts for additional
information.102-2, 102-6

6ABOUT EQT
Ethics and Integrity
Doing the Right Thing
At EQT, we believe each of us has a responsibility for maintaining and enhancing our reputation. Our daily decision-making is guided by our
values; in mid-2019, we introduced new company values — Trust, Teamwork, Heart and Evolution. We communicate our expectations for
responsible and ethical conduct to all those performing business on behalf of the company through our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
(code). Our code acts as a guide and resource related to personal responsibilities, compliance with law and the use of good judgement while
working on behalf of the company. It covers such topics as environment, health and safety, avoiding conflicts of interest, communicating and
cooperating with regulators, political involvement, diversity and inclusion, and honest and ethical dealing. W e regularly update our code in
collaboration with subject matter experts to ensure it reflects the ever-changing work environment and legal and regulatory landscape. Any
changes to the code are approved in advance by EQT's senior management.
We require all new employees to receive in-person compliance and ethics training, in addition to an online code training. Employees are also
trained on other compliance and ethics topics relevant to their work responsibilities. All employees must annually confirm their continued
understanding and compliance with our code and related policies.
EQT’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics also applies to our suppliers, vendors, agents, contractors and consultants (collectively, our
business partners). We expect our business partners to provide services or goods in compliance with our code or their own written code of
conduct, if it complies with the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines and all applicable laws and regulations. W e annually remind the majority of
our business partners of their obligation to comply with our code and, specifically , their responsibilities related to conflicts of interest. We
publicize our compliance hotline number at all work locations and provide it to our business partners so they may anonymously report
suspected misconduct or ask questions.102-16, SASB 510a.2
7Communicating Concerns 
Although our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics provides strong guidance for our employees and business partners, it cannot be all-
inclusive. We annually provide a combination of in-person and online training to reinforce the message that employees are encouraged to
communicate concerns of misconduct to their supervisors, the Compliance Network or the compliance hotline.
The EQT Compliance Network, a group of senior-level employees from Internal Audit, Human Resources, Compliance and Ethics, Legal,
Safety and Environmental, is another resource available to employees to seek guidance regarding ethical and lawful behavior and report
misconduct. EQT’s compliance hotline offers employees and stakeholders an anonymous way to ask questions and report misconduct. The
compliance hotline is operated by a nationally recognized, independent service provider and is available 24 hours a day , seven days a week.
Misconduct can also be reported directly to the board of directors via the EQT website. W e do not currently track the number of requests for
advice, the request descriptions or level of satisfaction for those using the advice mechanisms.102-17
8ABOUT EQT
Governance
EQT’s Governance Structure
EQT’s board of directors is the highest governance body at the company and is responsible for overseeing the management of EQT’s
business. Our board leadership philosophy is outlined in paragraph 5(g) of our Corporate Governance Guidelines.  EQT completed the
separation of our upstream and midstream businesses on November 12, 2018, with the spinof f of the standalone midstream company,
Equitrans Midstream Corporation (NYSE: ETRN) (the spin-off). On July 10, 2019, Toby Z. Rice was named EQT’s president and CEO, and
John F. McCartney was elected chairman of the board of directors.
Board Committees
As of November 2019, EQT has four standing board committees:
Audit 
Management Development and Compensation
Corporate Governance
Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility
The Corporate Governance Committee identifies and recommends requisite skills and characteristics for individuals to serve as directors. The
committee identifies potential director candidates through many sources, including third-party search firms and unsolicited shareholder
submissions. All EQT Directors annually stand for election by shareholders. For additional information on board member qualifications, please
see the board of directors page on EQT’s website. For more information on EQT’s nomination and selection process, see pages 36-39 of
EQT’s 2019 Proxy Statement.
Upon selection, EQT Directors participate in an initial orientation to board service and routinely receive information from management to inform
them about company business, including related economic, environmental and social topics. EQT encourages directors to participate in outside
educational programs, for which EQT funds or reimburses participation.102-18, 102-23
102-24
102-27
9EQT discloses conflicts of interest to stakeholders as required by law . EQT’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  outlines our policy to avoid
conflicts of interest (we also have an internal Conflicts of Interest Policy). EQT maintains a majority of independent directors and our Corporate
Governance Committee monitors related-person transactions. For more information, see pages 40-42 of EQT’s 2019 Proxy Statement.
The board and its committees use performance assessments to evaluate how well they are fulfilling their governance responsibilities. The
board and its committees conduct annual self-assessments and each director — in a discussion with the chairman of the board — provides
feedback on individual director performance. Although the board does not publicly disclose any actions taken in response to its annual self-
assessments, it takes the assessment process seriously and responds appropriately to the results to improve overall governance performance.

10Additionally, the Audit Committee of the board reviews the company’s major risk exposures and key processes implemented to monitor and
control such exposures. When making decisions on behalf of EQT, the board considers the feedback provided by its respective stakeholders.
The assessment and management of environmental, safety and social impacts, risks and opportunities is embedded within EQT’ s day-to-day
operations and is the responsibility of all EQT employees. The board of directors has broad oversight of the company’ s sustainability efforts,
and regularly receives reports from senior management regarding sustainability . In addition, the board has delegated, to certain committees,
specific oversight of topics that fall within the scope of that committee’ s charter. For example, the Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility
Committee is charged with providing oversight for a variety of topics, including (but not limited to) matters of public policy and the company’ s
safety and environmental performance. For more information about the board’ s role in risk oversight, see pages 35-36 of EQT’s 2019 Proxy
Statement.
EQT’s board delegates authority for select economic, environmental and social topics to the CEO, who reports directly to the board. The CEO
delegates some of these authorities to senior management based upon their established roles and responsibilities within the company . These
senior managers report to the CEO and often present updates to the board regarding the economic, environmental and social risks and
opportunities facing the company. Management, in collaboration with the board, also reviews the company’s performance in managing the
impacts of these activities.
2018 Board Meetings
At committee meetings, the board reviews, economic, environmental and social impacts, risks and opportunities facing EQT , as warranted.
*The Executive Committee only meets and/or acts in extraordinary circumstances. In 2018, the board acted as a whole on all matters and did not delegate any tasks to the
Executive Committee.
The Vice President of Communications at EQT Corporation is accountable for compiling and verifying the information set forth in the company’s
corporate social responsibility report.
Communicating with the Board
To achieve sustainable performance for shareholders, employees, landowners, customers and communities, the board is committed to
overseeing EQT with integrity, accountability and transparency. The board welcomes input on how it is doing and provides stakeholders
multiple ways to communicate with EQT’s governing body.
The chairman of the board is a key point of contact within the board for concerns or inquiries. Other avenues for contacting the EQT board
include:
Corporate Secretary, investor relations, the executive team and respective websites
The EQT Compliance Hotline

11While EQT does not have systems in place to track the concerns communicated to the board of directors, EQT has conducted a formal
shareholder engagement program since 2010, and we maintain active dialogue with our shareholders year-round. Through our investor
relations program, senior executives hold meetings with EQT investors or potential investors to discuss operations, strategy and other critical
items as outlined on pages 5-6 of EQT’s 2019 Proxy Statement. In 2018, we held more than 460 meetings with EQT investors. Executives from
the Compensation and Governance functions also meet with interested shareholders to discuss the company’ s pay structure and governance
with time devoted to answering shareholder questions and taking suggestions for changes. Our management team uses the annual corporate
social responsibility report to help guide conversations with investors regarding economic, environmental and social topics. When investors
pose specific questions, the team schedules calls and/or meetings to address their inquiries accordingly .
As described in Stakeholder Engagement,  the board values and regularly considers the input and feedback of all stakeholders in its oversight
of the company’s sustainability efforts.
Director and Executive Compensation
EQT independent director compensation — including descriptions of cash, equity-based and other compensation — as well as related
processes, are outlined on pages 43-46 of EQT’s 2019 Proxy Statement. Annually, the Corporate Governance Committee reviews and the EQT
board approves the compensation.
The Management Development and Compensation Committee of the EQT board establishes the target total direct compensation for executive
officers by establishing base salaries, setting long-term and annual incentive targets, and approving perquisites. The committee approves
annual and long-term incentive programs on a yearly basis with recommendations from management and an independent compensation
consultant. For more information regarding our executive compensation process, see pages 32-34 of EQT’s 2019 Proxy Statement;
additionally, pages 51-113 describe the executive compensation program and performance.
EQT has a compensation recoupment or “clawback” policy applicable to executive of ficers if the company is required to prepare an accounting
restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting mandate under U.S. securities law . The policy authorizes the company
to recoup certain compensation from covered executives who received equity or non-equity incentive compensation.
This year marked the ninth consecutive year of shareholder outreach ef forts targeting the company’s compensation and governance practices.
The results of these meetings are reviewed with the CEO, Corporate Governance Committee and the Management Development and
Compensation Committee. In 2018, we requested governance and compensation targeted meetings with investors representing approximately
58% of our outstanding shares, met with holders of 16.5% of our outstanding shares, and were told by holders representing another 10% that
meetings were unnecessary, as they were content with our practices. In response to the feedback recorded in these meetings, EQT:
The Management Development and Compensation Committee also considers investor feedback during the design of our long-term incentive
programs. SAY-ON-PAY VOTING RESULTS 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019*

*The company believes that the 2019 say-on-pay results are primarily a byproduct of the contested nature of the 2019 annual shareholder ’s meeting, which resulted in leadership
turnover. The recently reconstituted EQT board of directors is re-evaluating the company’s executive compensation practices.
For the 2018 calendar year, our CEO’s annualized total compensation was $5,676,154, and the median annual total compensation of all
company employees (other than our CEO) was $114,490. Based on this information, the ratio of the annualized total compensation of our CEO
to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 49.6 to 1. Please see page 1 13 of EQT’s 2019 Proxy Statement for
more information regarding our annual total compensation ratio.

12Environment and Climate
EQT strives to operate safely, protect the environment and continuously improve our practices in support of responsible natural gas
production. We carefully monitor our air emissions, water, waste and energy use as well as our operational impact on biodiversity and
ecosystems. Our Environment, Health and Safety Policy (shown below) outlines our internal processes and guidelines for all employees to
follow to avoid harm to the environment.
In 2018, EQT joined the ONE Future Coalition, a group of natural gas companies working together to use a science-based approach to reduce
methane emissions across the industry’s supply chain. We believe that such targets should be meaningful to our investors and other
stakeholders and align with EQT's long-term strategy. EQT also participates in The Environmental Partnership,  a group of U.S. oil and gas
companies committed to improving the industry’s environmental performance, and is a founding partner of the Center for Responsible Shale
Development  (CRSD), a nonprofit organization consisting of environmental organizations and energy companies. The members of CRSD
collaborate to develop realistic performance standards for shale development that incorporate community needs and environmental protection.
Environment, Health and Safety Policy
Safety is a top priority for our organization. EQT will provide a safe and healthful workplace for its employees and contractors and through
continuous improvement, we will work to create and maintain a zero-injury culture. W e will not compromise safety to gain a business
advantage.
EQT also has a steadfast commitment to the protection of our environment. EQT will conduct its business operations in a sustainable and
environmentally responsible manner at all times – striving to preserve and protect the land, air and water where we live and do business.
The following principles will guide us toward superior Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) performance. EQT and its employees will:
Provide and foster leadership to ensure all employees and contractors understand their responsibilities and that all employees are provided
with the training and support necessary to integrate EHS principles into their work.
Manage our business to prevent incidents that could result in harm to people, communities, property or the environment.
Seek public input regarding our operations in order to facilitate continuous improvement in our EHS performance.
Integrate EHS considerations into planning, design, construction and operation of all our processes, programs and facilities.
Optimize conservation of natural resources.
Commit the resources necessary for successful implementation of this EHS Policy .
Provide an effective EHS management system that drives innovation and continuous improvement, as well as employee and contractor
adherence to EQT processes and requirements.
Foster business relationships with companies committed to superior EHS performance.
Operate in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations; and contribute to the development of responsible EHS legislation,
regulation and industry best practices.TOPICS COVERED

Climate and GHG Emissions
Why Managing It Matters
As the effects of climate change on our planet become more apparent, and the potential for regulation and the demand for lower-carbon
energy sources increase, EQT remains informed and committed to being proactive about climate change science. Quantifying and managing
our GHG emissions not only protects the environment, it also reduces regulatory risk. EQT’ s ability to find ways to reduce energy consumption
and emissions in the office, on the job site and on the road has a positive impact on the environment, our employees and our bottom line.
It is our responsibility to provide cleaner energy alternatives. While natural gas produces significantly less carbon dioxide when compared with
other fossil fuels — up to 50% less than coal and 20-30% less than oil, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists — methane leakage
from natural gas infrastructure across the industry remains a contributor to climate change. Methane is 84 times more potent than CO2 as a
GHG, and is therefore a management priority for EQT. We maintain and monitor best management practices to minimize GHG emissions
while making improvements to reduce our climate impact.
Management Approach
EQT’s energy consumption and GHG emissions originate from three sources — facilities, operations and fleet transportation. We drive
continuous improvement and seek innovative ways to conserve energy , reduce emissions and minimize our environmental footprint. Direct
(Scope 1) GHG emissions result from sources owned or controlled by EQT . The majority of Scope 1 emissions originate from fuel combustion
and natural gas-driven pneumatic equipment. EQT does not track energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions. W e report GHG emissions and
reduction initiatives to the Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility Committee of the board of directors. The committee provides commentsCLIMATE AND GHG EMISSIONS
TOPIC DESCRIPTION
Carefully managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including methane, from operations; promoting energy conservation; and addressing current and potential

Committee discusses environmental, health and safety issues — which can include air and climate — on a regular basis.
Climate Management
Current legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and GHG emissions are in various phases of discussion or
implementation. EQT keeps abreast of these measures to remain compliant and understand how they may af fect our operations.
In 2018, the company began to develop a climate change policy to articulate EQT’ s position regarding climate change and to memorialize
EQT’s philosophy with respect to mitigating operational impact. The policy will also be used as a lens against which we will evaluate proposed
and pending climate regulation. Development of the policy has been put on hold to allow the current management team the opportunity to
provide input. For more information about climate-related risks, see page 29 in our 2018 Form 10-K.
Facilities
We regularly track energy consumption in EQT’s owned and leased facilities. More than half of EQT’s total energy consumption is derived
from the use of purchased electricity, which powers lighting, cooling, computers, audio/video and other support equipment. EQT’s facilities use
electricity primarily generated by coal, natural gas and nuclear power . We compared the 2017 and 2018 usage totals for offices that remained
with EQT post-separation in November 2018. In 2018, our total energy consumption across facilities was 26,391 GJ, as compared to 24,825 in
2017. Our energy usage in 2018 totaled 17,156 GJ and was primarily generated by natural gas. The occupancy levels of our EQT facilities
increased from 2017 to 2018 as buildings became more occupied. The heating/cooling degree days also increased in our operating regions
with the heating degree days rising an average of 12% and the cooling degree days rising an average of 18%. Despite the higher occupancy
levels in 2018 and the increase in degree days, our energy usage only increased by 6% from 2017 to 2018.
We work to improve energy efficiency at our leased facilities through preventive maintenance and equipment upgrades, such as motion
sensor lighting, energy-efficiency fixtures, temperature controls and daily power down of phone displays. At owned facilities, we seek to
increase efficiencies by making capital improvements to permanent building controls, such as boilers, thermostats and lighting systems.

15Methane and Other GHG Emissions Reduction
EQT’s operational GHG air emissions depend greatly on the type and amount of field activity being conducted at any given time and vary on
an annual basis. According to a National Academy of Sciences 2012 study, natural gas would be the most effective fossil fuel for reducing
GHG emissions when compared to gasoline, diesel and coal, if less than 1% of gross production of methane was lost between production and
distribution. EQT is active in a number of partnerships seeking to reduce emissions in the oil and gas industry .
For instance, in 2018, EQT joined the ONE Future Coalition (ONE Future), a group of natural gas companies working together to use a
science-based approach to reduce methane emissions across the industry’ s supply chain.
In connection with ONE Future, EQT is working to reduce methane emissions and learn how we might improve our own processes. Among
other things, ONE Future focuses on bringing industry emissions below the 1% leakage rate. EQT is currently meeting the sector-level target
and, as a whole, ONE Future has shown that the industry can achieve leakage rates below 1%.EQT METHANE INTENSITY * ONE FUTURE INTENSITY PRODUCTION SECTOR TARGET
2017 0.15%
0.28%
2018 0.06%
* Methane intensity is a calculation of methane emissions over natural gas throughput.
EQT is also a participant in The Environmental Partnership,  a group of U.S. oil and gas companies committed to continuously improving the  
industry’s environmental performance. The Environmental Partnership provides programs designed to reduce emissions of methane and  
volatile organic compounds using proven cost-effective technologies. Specific to shale development in the Appalachian Basin, EQT leverages  
the Center for Responsible Shale Development’s performance standards related to air and climate performance. For more information, see  
the 2018 ONE Future report.
Wellpad Design
EQT uses pneumatic level switches and liquid level controllers to set thresholds and control motor valves for managing fluid in vessels such  
as separators, scrubbers and contact towers. For example, EQT operates thousands of pneumatic controllers and level switches that regulate
gas/liquid separation volumes or activate shutdowns when high or low liquid levels occur.

electricity are difficult to obtain at most production facilities, natural gas is typically used to power the pneumatic devices. The EPA classifies 
natural gas pneumatic controllers and level switches into three categories: continuous high-bleed, continuous low-bleed and intermittent bleed.  
High-bleed pneumatic controllers are significant sources of methane emissions when compared to low or intermittent bleed controllers 1 .
According to the Code of Federal Regulations, replacement of a high-bleed controller with a low-bleed or intermittent bleed controller results in  
a GHG emissions reduction of 96% and 64% respectively 2 . EQT currently does not operate any high bleed pneumatic controllers. Consistent  
with the theme of continuous operational improvement, EQT is now evaluating the potential to replace its intermittent and low-bleed pneumatic  
controllers with electric or air-driven controllers.
OG3
EQT also utilizes solar and fuel cell technologies, which further reduce our overall GHG emissions. W e use solar technology to generate  
power on some wellpads and capture natural gas from the field to power fuel cells at a few sites, generating on-site energy . We do not 
currently track the amount of energy produced by these means.
Leak Detection and Repair Program
EQT's facilities operate in compliance with federal standards and permit requirements in each state where we operate. EQT’ s primary 
operations are in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, where robust air emission regulations cover the oil and gas sector. EQT uses an 
internal team of certified camera operators to perform Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) surveys utilizing optical gas imaging (OGI)  
technology at all compressor stations, dehydration facilities and unconventional wellpads.
A small team of EQT employees has been trained by OGI experts and certified to operate gas detection cameras. EQT uses three types of  
OGI cameras, which are all verified by the manufacturer to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's (EP A) LDAR requirements under the  
EPA's New Source Performance Standards for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry. The training consists of a three-day course that includes both  
classroom and onsite experience. The course objectives are to explain the regulatory framework for OGI, demonstrate proper operation of the  
cameras, explain the basics of thermal science and illustrate the nuances of using the specialized technology . At the end of 2018, nine EQT 
employees had been trained and certified in optical gas imaging. 
Depending on the facility, the frequency of EQT’s LDAR surveys can range from monthly to annually. Our well operators perform auditory, 
visual and olfactory (AVO) inspections annually for each of our conventional wells. Additionally, we perform quarterly mechanical integrity  
inspections (MIAs) for our conventional wells in Pennsylvania, during which leaks can be identified.
In West Virginia, we visit conventional wells with storage vessels at least quarterly. At that time, well operators perform inspections for gas  
leaks.
As an additional leak detection measure on our unconventional wells, EQT has remote gas detection monitors inside the gas processing units  
(GPU) that monitor for leaks in real time. If a leak is detected by the remote gas detection monitors, an alert is sent to EQT's gas control  
center, which then assigns a specialist to conduct an inspection. Any confirmed leak is repaired as soon as practical. If a safety concern is  
present, repairs are completed as quickly as possible after the conditions are deemed safe. All leak repairs are re-surveyed with an OGI  
camera to confirm that the repair was successful. Unless deemed an emergency or hazardous situation, EQT’ s standard practice is to repair  
all minor leaks immediately and all other leaks within 15 days. EQT's standard practice exceeds state and federal requirements related to leak  
repair procedures, and we are upgrading our management system to track leak repairs at our wellpads.
In 2018, no repairs were delayed beyond the applicable regulatory limits, and more than 90% of all leaks detected in production operations  
were repaired immediately.

17Venting/Flaring Practices
EQT operates conventional wells, unconventional wellpads, compressor stations, dehydration facilities and meter sites. Since 2015, EQT has
used a green completions program  to reduce the volume of flared-gas. Green completions technology transfers the natural gas at the
wellhead to a separator immediately after well completion as opposed to flaring or venting the gas. During 2018, all wells completed utilized
green completions technology. To minimize flaring at condensate wells, we utilize varying methods of emissions minimization options including
the design of closed-vent systems with low-pressure separators, vapor recovery systems and vapor destruction systems.2016 2017 2018
TOTAL AMOUNT OF GAS FLARED AND VENTED BY THE
COMPANY DURING COMPLETIONS ACTIVITIES (THOUSANDS
OF METRIC TONS)0 0 0
During the production phase of a well, EQT’s flaring and venting practices differ based on the amount of condensate and oil produced.
Generally, the industry considers a “dry gas” site as a site that produces water, methane and ethane but not significant natural gas liquids,
condensate or oils. A site that consistently produces natural gas in addition to condensate and/or oil is considered a “wet gas” site. Dry gas
sites generally have significantly less emissions when compared to wet gas sites and require less control.
Since 2016, EQT has implemented best management practices for the installation of pilot-operated valves and latch-down hatches on closed-
vent systems, necessitating the installation of low-pressure separators with vapor recovery systems during periods of high production. EQT
has 22 low pressure separators and vapor recovery systems and has installed 253 pilot-operated valves and latch-down hatches. The valves,
hatches and additional separators have significantly improved sealing and reduced leaks. EQT conducts monthly LDAR inspections on these
closed vent systems and condensate wellpads.
Well Unloading
As a natural gas well ages, “liquid loading” occurs as liquids — primarily water — accumulate in the wellbores of the wells. These liquids
create back pressure that restricts or stops the flow of gas. To restore productivity, multiple approaches can unload the fluid from the wellbore;
the most simplistic is to flow the well to a lower pressure environment, such as an atmospheric tank. As part of our ongoing ef forts to minimize
emissions, EQT follows guidance from The Environmental Partnership  to reduce methane emissions from well unloading.
If a well only produces through production casing, EQT installs tubing to reduce flow area to allow the gas to ef ficiently unload the fluid. EQT
installs well tubing on an accelerated schedule to limit the amount of venting that occurs from well unloading activities, reducing the amount of
methane emissions. We are further able to minimize tank venting by using automated plunger lift equipment in wells with tubing. Where this is
not possible, it may be necessary to utilize a swab rig to mechanically remove fluids from a well to restore flow . For unconventional wells, EQT
has personnel on site while unloading wells and will continue to do so. Additionally , EQT follows industry best practice to install plunger lifts
one to three years into a well’s life. Each of these methods achieve liquid removal without releasing emissions directly to the atmosphere 3.
Dehydration Units
To reduce methane emissions, EQT uses glycol pumps rather than natural gas pneumatics pumps on existing dehydration systems to transfer
bulk glycol. These pumps only emit gas embedded within the glycol and do not need to be powered by natural gas pressure resulting in lower
methane emissions. Additionally, to further minimize emissions, it is our standard protocol to install condensers on new dehydration
regenerator still columns. These units condense volatile liquid organics out of the gas and vapor streams collecting marketable natural gas
liquids, minimizing odors and emissions, and sending the resulting emissions to a vapor destruction unit.
Transportation
EQT has operations in multiple states requiring us to rely upon trucks and other fleet vehicles for the transportation of workers and materials to
job sites. EQT vehicles drive millions of miles annually, and we actively pursue efficient, cleaner-burning alternatives to carbon rich fuels, such
as compressed natural gas (CNG). During the fourth quarter of 2018, we also began to evaluate the possibility of reducing the size of our fleet.
Evaluating Our Approach
We monitor and report on air emissions from our operations as required by state and federal regulations. We gather operational data and
calculate emissions annually to comply with each state’s emissions inventory requirements where we have operations. For sources subject to
the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, we submit reports to the EPA, where they are validated electronically. EQT is not subject to
any GHG emissions-limiting regulations. We seek continuous improvement capabilities in areas that provide the most opportunity for GHG
reductions.OG6

response to our 2018 GHG inventory. The previous methodology utilized an operating time for our intermittent pneumatic controllers of 500 hours per year, and the new
methodology uses 8,760 hours per year. The 2018 inventory reflects a refined inventory of intermittent natural gas controllers and a more accurate count of those controllers.
2017 GHG and methane emissions intensities do not include emissions from facilities acquired from Rice Energy for the period November 13, 2017 to December 31, 2017.
As EQT strives to continuously improve our operating systems and equipment to reduce GHG emissions and increase overall ef ficiency, we
will continue collaborating with ONE Future, CRSD and the Environmental Partnership. As part of these ef forts, we will continue sharing best
practices with other ONE Future program participants and, where appropriate, use this information to improve performance.305-1

While EQT is confident in our current climate strategy, we understand we must continue to anticipate potential climate change impacts and  
new regulations, and prepare for future compliance challenges. EQT utilizes both internal inspections and third-party audits for compliance  
with regulatory and voluntary programs. We voluntarily conducted a leak detection and repair audit in 2018, the results of which informed  
improvements to our operations.

19ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE
Water
Why Managing It Matters
Today’s sophisticated natural gas production process relies on water for its innovative procedures. EQT must meet stringent regulatory
safeguards to protect water resources in the communities where we operate and ensure that production activities have no lasting negative
effects. EQT understands and appreciates the importance of maintaining water quality and quantity standards in maintaining human and
ecological health, and we utilize best management practices to adhere to strict environmental standards. W e have a vested interest in our
communities, as the majority of our employees and contractors live and work in our operating areas.
Management Approach
EQT recognizes that natural gas development activities are water intensive, and we are dedicated to protecting fresh water by operating
responsibly. In our operations, we strive to minimize the quantity of fresh water used and mindfully select and carefully manage the quality of
water sources. EQT’s developed practices for effective water management include identifying and evaluating water sources, permitting
locations and operating withdrawal sites. We identify potential risks in each relevant category as well as appropriate mitigation, should the
need arise.WATER
TOPIC DESCRIPTION
Minimizing water use, increasing use of recycled water and protecting local water sources.
103-1
103-2
20EQT only operates within the Appalachian Basin 4 , which has a richer water supply than other basins where water is scarcer. That said, EQT  
takes our conservation responsibility seriously and cooperates with state agencies to permit each water withdrawal site, which includes a full  
evaluation of watersheds and a recommended maximum flow rate. We adhere to agency recommendations on flow rates and do not exceed  
the maximum daily allowance to protect the quality and quantity of each source. Surface water withdrawals are taken in accordance with a  
state-approved water management plan ensuring that we will not withdraw water from a stream during low flow conditions and that adequate  
water remains in the water body for aquatic species and downstream users. In addition to surface water withdrawal, we obtain water from  
municipalities in accordance with a contract from local or regional municipal water suppliers.
Governance
EQT’s Environmental Department, led by our Corporate Director, Environmental Affairs, is responsible for the oversight and management of  
all aspects of our environmental footprint. This department reports to the V ice President of Environment, Health and Safety. Each quarter, we 
share environmental progress, including violations, with the Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our board of directors.  
Additionally, regulatory agencies in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio receive reports pursuant to water withdrawal permits regarding  
EQT’s water usage.
Hydraulic Fracturing
SASB 140a.3 ,SASB 140a.4
To increase the productivity of shale formations, natural gas extraction relies on the process of hydraulic fracturing — the use of fluid to create  
pressure to crack shale formations underground that release the natural gas. This fracturing fluid is composed of water mixed with sand and a  
small percentage of chemical additives. To reduce the likelihood of groundwater or aquifer contamination, our wells have multiple layers of  
steel and cement — a process known as triple casing.
Further demonstrating our commitment to protecting water resources, EQT is proud to be a charter participant of FracFocus.org, an 
independent educational website created by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. EQT  
discloses chemicals used down hole through FracFocus, which uses the systems approach to decouple trade names from individual  
ingredients on the chemical disclosure form by listing all the ingredients without the specific recipe. T o that end, EQT regularly updates our  
public disclosure of all chemicals added to 100% of our hydraulically fractured wells. Additionally , we continuously explore more  
environmentally friendly alternatives for our fluids. We do not use diesel additives in our fracturing fluid and have continuously worked to  
optimize and reduce the amount of other chemicals used. Our fracturing fluids are limited to bactericide, scale inhibitor (with minimum  
concentrations only when needed) and friction reducer.
In 2018, we determined that none (0%) of our hydraulic fracturing sites deteriorated the surrounding ground or surface water quality compared  
to baseline testing.
Monitoring Water Impacts
SASB 140a.2
Our primary method to reduce water usage is recycling wastewater generated from drilling, completions and well operations. This approach  
minimizes fresh water withdrawals, primarily through the recycling of water produced in our hydraulic fracturing process and from our  
production process. EQT recycles more than 90% of the wastewater (flowback and produced water) that we generate. We also have  
evaluated other water sources, including coal mine wastewater, but the water chemistry characteristics of the coal mine water sources  
available in our operating areas have not been suitable for hydraulic fracturing operations.
Further, we strive to protect the fresh water in our communities by investing in new technology, leveraging industry best practices, reusing  
water whenever possible and disclosing the chemical makeup of our fracturing fluids. Well integrity is critical in preventing impacts on water  
supplies typically found within a few hundred feet of the surface. T o protect these shallow aquifers, EQT drills the section of a well that could  
potentially contain any freshwater using freshwater, soap and air. The drilling is “under-balanced,” which prevents the freshwater, soap and air  
from flowing into the formation. After drilling the freshwater section of the well, steel pipes — or casings — are cemented in the borehole to  
protect groundwater and allow production of gas. EQT performs casing pressure tests and runs cement bond logs as required by individual  
state regulations, and in turn, submits reports on these tests and logs to the applicable state agency when required. EQT has not had a well  
integrity failure that resulted in an impact to the environment.
Our mature water-well protection program includes conducting both pre- and post-drill sampling at nearby landowners’ private water  supplies. 
We analyze water supplies — including water wells, springs, ponds and streams — for general water quality constituents as well as  metals, 
dissolved gas, petroleum constituents and, if warranted, bacteriological parameters. We conduct pre-drill sampling once for all water  
sources within 3,000 feet of the well pad and post-drill sampling for sources within 1,500 feet of the well pad at six and twelve months after  
completing the last gas well on the pad.
4 Water Risk Filter: EQT operates primarily within areas with very low to low Baseline Water Stress (<20%) and very low risk to Water Depletion. There are some wells operated  
by EQT within Tioga County, Pa., with a medium Baseline Water Stress.
21We compile and track pre- and post-drill results within the EQT geographic information system (GIS) mapping application and submit records
to the property owner as well as the relevant state environmental agency . EQT examines every landowner quality or quantity concern. If there
are any perceived issues, EQT immediately conducts a thorough hydrogeologic review and coordinates with the appropriate internal and
external stakeholders to address and resolve the issue.
EQT stores both fresh and impaired water in double wall tanks and open impoundments. Our impaired water impoundments are inspected
weekly, have leak detection systems and are only found in West Virginia. In our other operating areas, we use tanks protected by containment
that meets Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure best practices to store water produced during production. Containment at all
unconventional wellpads is inspected monthly for adequacy. EQT does not currently use any wastewater for purposes other than hydraulic
fracturing.
Water Sources
EQT uses the following definitions: WATER WITHDRAWN NORMALIZED FRESHWATER WITHDRAWAL RECYCLED WATER
The water obtained from sources such as lakes, rivers,
reservoirs or municipal spigots/hydrants. EQT obtains
permits for its fresh water sources and adheres to all
applicable local, state and federal guidelines.The ratio of water withdrawn (in cubic meters or m 3) to
barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe) produced by the
company.The water that is recycled for reuse by EQT’s
operations. This includes flowback, drilling water and
produced water collected from drilling operations.
As described above, our primary sources of fresh water are surface and municipal water . Rainwater continues to have a minimal effect on
EQT’s water usage. Many of our water storage facilities and pits passively collect rainwater for use in our operations. However, accurately
measuring total usage is difficult due to low volume and other variables.
Our fresh water withdrawal varies annually for the following reasons:
The location and seasonal availability of fresh water may not match the location and timing of drilling and completions activity .
The completion of more hydraulically fractured wells results in greater total water usage.
The use of longer laterals — the horizontal portion of the well — requires more water for each completion while at the same time reducing
the number of drilling pads and minimizing surface disturbance.For the past several years, EQT has increased our utilization of recycled water , lessening our environmental footprint. We have sourced  
wastewater from recycling facilities and a third-party producer for the past five years.
Evaluating Our Approach
103-3 ,307-1
EQT tracks water withdrawals by source, whether or not any water sources are significantly af fected by our operations and the quantity of  
water recycled. We maintain a set of best management practices for water, including digital dashboards for monitoring performance against  
our operational Key Performance Indicators — such as environmental incidents — and a Production Control Center to optimize schedules and  
monitor our assets in real time. We also leverage annual third-party environmental audits for a selection of operating facilities and sites. In  
2018, we implemented a new procedure for EQT contractors to ensure compliance with water withdrawal requirements, which includes a daily  
review and approval process prior to water withdrawal.
303-2
EQT complies with individual state regulations and water withdrawal and wastewater limits (see Effluents and Waste for additional  
information). Our water withdrawal in 2018 did not significantly af fect any water sources. We carefully monitor the availability of fresh water to  
ensure we avoid overuse when supply is limited. EQT did not use any water sourced from water-stressed areas in 2018.

23ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE
Effluents and Waste
Why Managing It Matters
Wastewater and solid waste, such as drill mud and cuttings, are both by-products of the drilling process in our operations. Careful
management of this waste, including the minimization and appropriate disposal of wastes, prevents spills and protects people and the
environment.
Management Approach, Performance and Evaluation
EQT’s most prevalent by-products from the drilling process are wastewater from hydraulic fracturing and solid wastes, such as drill mud and
cuttings. We pursue various strategies to recycle water (see Water for recycled water data) and are committed to identifying and employing
safe waste disposal methods that reduce ecological impact and organizational costs. Additionally , to ensure the safety and health of our
workers and communities and to preserve the environment, we abide by policies and procedures designed to minimize and mitigate liquid
spills and releases. EQT enters into master service agreements with all contracted landfills to track disposed waste and periodically performs
compliance inspections at those facilities.
Governance
EQT’s Corporate Director of Environmental Affairs leads our Environmental Department, which oversees and manages all aspects of our
environmental footprint. This department reports to the Vice President of Environment, Health and Safety and is ultimately guided by the
Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility Committee of the board of directors. Each quarter , we share environmental progress with the
committee. Additionally, regulatory agencies in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio receive quarterly reports on EQT’s water usage, as
required. We submit Chemical Analysis of Residual Waste reports to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection annually to
satisfy regulatory waste reporting requirements for the state.EFFLUENTS AND WASTE

24Wastewater
For our Appalachian Basin operations, EQT follows the Center for Responsible Shale Development (CRSD)  performance standards, including
maximizing water recycling to decrease wastewater volume, safe wastewater disposal and ef fluent monitoring. We recycle wastewater after
the completion of a well by collecting flowback, drilling and produced water to reuse when fracturing new wells. In 2018, more than 90% of the
wastewater we generated was recycled.
Any wastewater that cannot be recycled is disposed of at permitted commercial disposal facilities — typically underground injection facilities in
Ohio — where formations are most suitable for injection. EQT conducts annual inspections of these facilities to ensure they are operating in
compliance with their permit. While increased seismic activity due to wastewater disposal can be a concern, EQT believes Ohio’ s recent
upgrades to its injection and permitting program address potential seismicity problems. Further , the volumes injected are relatively small
compared to other states that have experienced seismicity, such as Oklahoma, where the injection is roughly 50 times more than Ohio. For
example, in 2014, 1.54 billion gallons were injected in Oklahoma compared to 28.5 million gallons injected in Ohio.
We frequently evaluate wastewater treatment technologies that could further reduce disposal amounts. For instance, in 2017, we piloted an
evaporation-based treatment technology to treat wastewater, and in 2018, we installed evaporator technology at a well pad in Tioga County,
Pa. These technologies concentrate the waste stream and reduce the amount of wastewater needing disposal.
We do not intentionally discharge any wastewater and did not hold any permits to discharge wastewater in 2018. We are the fourth of the
founding members to meet or exceed all 15 CRSD Performance Standards of environmental stewardship and continuous improvement for air
and water protection.
EQT does not discharge any produced water to surface water; therefore, no strategies or criteria are necessary for disposal and treatment; no
report standards for produced water quality are required; and EQT has no volume of hydrocarbon discharged in produced water to report.

OG5
25To reduce the likelihood and impact of significant spills, we maintain Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans for every
worksite that stores fluid. These comprehensive plans, based on regulation established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), guide our employees and contractors to minimize the chance for a release and dictate the actions required should a spill occur. The
plans define training programs, inspection protocols, secondary containment monitoring and repair programs required at each of our natural
gas wells and compressor stations.
Our emergency response and preparedness program requires the following actions in the event an incident occurs:
Determine the source and type of spill, and begin taking corrective action.
Evacuate any employees requiring medical attention.
Isolate the area, and stop the spill as soon as possible using appropriate methods.
Contain the spill with available resources, including containment ditches, diking and spill kits complete with absorbent booms, pads, pillows
and personal protective equipment (EQT does not use chemical dispersants).
Notify the immediate supervisor or area manager and the environmental coordinator of all spills and complete an environmental incident
investigation form.
Perform, or observe, proper clean-up measures as directed by the environmental coordinator .In the event of a spill, EQT uses appropriate clean-up techniques to mitigate the spill’ s effects, including removal of effluents from soil. We 
promptly remove and dispose of clean-up materials according to prevailing federal, state and local regulatory requirements, minimizing impact  
on the environment and local community. We then evaluate the cause of the spill to identify and implement corrective action. We work to 
prevent repeat accidents by integrating improved techniques and protocols into design standards, operations and future spill prevention plans.  
We share these with employees and contractors to continuously improve our operations.
306-3, SASB 160a.2
In August 2018, EQT had an unintentional release of 10 barrels of produced water from a temporary storage tank. The access hatch on a tank  
was not fully bolted shut, providing a pathway for the produced water to be released. The secondary containment around the tank leaked and  
the water flowed downhill to a small pond. The company remediated the site by removing the affected soil, gravel and water.Spill Prevention and Management
26Additionally, in 2018, EQT experienced 63 reportable events. These were related to any spill, release or discharge to the environment that 
triggered a permit or regulatory reporting requirement to a state or federal agency. It should be noted that Pennsylvania reporting 
requirements are the most stringent of the states in which we operate with any spill of 5 gallons or more to soil being reportable. EQT did 
not use any chemical dispersants in our cleanup measures, which entailed a complete recovery — removal and disposal — of 
contaminated gravel and  soil where required. Only one spill reached a waterway, as described above. Please refer to the below chart for 
more information.

EQT does not operate in the Arctic and, therefore, did not have any spills impact the Arctic or shorelines with Environmentally Sensitive Index
(ESI) rankings 8-10.
Solid Waste
EQT’s drill mud and cuttings are processed using solids control equipment that efficiently separate drilling fluids from solids. Drying agents
then remove any residual moisture, and the dried cuttings are containerized and trucked to landfills that are pre-approved to accept these
solids in their permitted disposal cells. EQT continues to improve the ef ficiency of its solids management program by using higher efficiency
systems that create better separation of drilling fluid and drill cuttings, reducing the overall weight of the disposed product. Using more
effective drying agents decreases the amount of agents needed, which also decreases the weight of the disposed product.
In 2018, we landfilled 337,403 tons of drill mud and cuttings from our operations. As per 40 CFR 261.4(b)(5), oil and gas wastes are excluded
from the definition of Hazardous Waste. As such, we do not have hazardous waste associated with our production activities and therefore did
not create or transport hazardous waste in 2018.

Disposal methods for 2016, 2017 and 2018 were determined by the company based on the availability and proximity of pre-approved waste
facilities. While disposal methods for our solid waste vary, we seek the most efficient, responsible and cost-effective methods possible. Our
priority is to reuse or recycle, but we also use landfills, deep well injection or other approved methods when appropriate. In doing so, we
comply with all regulatory requirements for the state or region.OG7, 306-2, 306-4
27ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Health
Why Managing It Matters
At year-end 2018, EQT owned or leased approximately 1.4 million gross acres primarily in Pennsylvania, W est Virginia and Ohio;
consequently, land plays a huge role in EQT’s daily activities. Exploration and production activity have the potential to impact the surrounding
landscape, including areas with high biodiversity value.
Management Approach, Performance and Evaluation
EQT actively works to minimize our impact on the land and wildlife where we operate, both because it is the right thing to do and because we
understand that our reputation depends on it. Our daily exploration and production of natural gas activities inevitably alter the land to some
degree; therefore, we strive to make careful decisions to limit our impact. As a member of the Marcellus Shale Coalition,  we participate in
working groups that focus on site planning, development, restoration and other topics that foster land protection.
Once operations are complete at a site, we work with property owners to restore their land — as closely as possible — to its original condition.
We reestablish contours and revegetate with state-approved seed mixes, native seed mixes and/or vegetation requested by landowners. We
also commonly accommodate agency requests to use specialized seed mixes (e.g., pollinator mixes) and landowner requests for topsoil
segregation. These techniques support local flora and fauna by allowing wildlife movement, restoration of pre-existing habitat and prevention
of invasive species. EQT works with landowners to successfully accommodate their preference for returning their land to its pre-construction
condition all while meeting the regulatory requirements set forth by state and federal agencies. This enables us to maintain positive
relationships with landowners and communities and support biodiversity and habitat protection.BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM HEALTH

EQT’s Environmental Department, led by our Corporate Director, Environmental Affairs, is responsible for the oversight and management of
all aspects of our environmental footprint. This department reports to the V ice President of Environment, Health and Safety, and is ultimately
guided by the Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility Committee of the board of directors.
Biodiversity and Land Management
We assess and monitor 100% of our business segment operations for biodiversity risks. EQT follows federal, state and local regulations
regarding species and habitat protection during operational activity near protected land or areas of high biodiversity .
We do not directly drill for natural gas production purposes on legally protected lands in our owned or leased properties; these include
wetlands, federal lands and national parks. When drilling on land adjacent to protected areas, we leverage our horizontal drilling expertise to
extract natural gas from underground without disturbing the surface or native species. Additionally , our horizontal drilling techniques enable us
to drill multiple gas wells from a single pad — which, in turn, helps to preserve the environment by minimizing surface impact. At the end of a
well’s life cycle, EQT carefully plugs each well and restores the land to as near its original condition as possible before exiting the area.

*EQT uses U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and USGS data to identify protected wetlands and land areas of high biodiversity .
In 2018, EQT owned or leased approximately 1,238 square kilometers of active acreage in legally protected areas. EQT did not directly drill
any wells in these protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value but rather leveraged our horizontal drilling technology to extract
resources from these areas; therefore, no habitats required protection or restoration in 2018.
Fifth-Grade Class Helps Save
Playground from Erosion
When McGuffey School District elementary students in Washington County,
Pa., noticed their playground and walking trail were shrinking into a nearby
stream within the Chartiers Creek watershed, they decided to take action. In
May 2018, 38 fifth-grade students from Joe Walker Elementary School wrote
letters to multiple groups, including the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy
(WPC), asking for help to save their playground. Their efforts paid off, and
the EQT Foundation awarded WPC a $55,000 grant to restore the
streambanks that run alongside the playground. Armed with maps and
markers, students helped WPC watershed staff design the future planting ofnative trees and shrubs, which occurred in the fall after the streambank had 
been re-graded.OG4

29Bats, snakes, mussels and plants are the most common endangered species found within EQT’ s operating areas. Prior to commencing
operations in any area, we conduct studies to determine whether threatened or endangered species exist in that region. In consideration of
species protection, EQT consults with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and state wildlife resource agencies to ensure
operations do not adversely affect threatened or endangered species within proposed project locations. Throughout the past several years,
EQT and nine other oil and gas companies collaborated with the USFWS to continue developing a multi-state Habitat Conservation Plan to
avoid, minimize and offset the effects of our operations on five native bat species in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio during the next 50
years. EQT participated in this program in 2018 and the initiative continued into 2019.
We also use various domestic environmental registries to identify potential impacts to threatened, endangered and special concern species or
resources near possible areas of operation. We make it a priority to avoid disturbing these species and habitats, but if this is not possible, we
work with appropriate federal and state agencies to prevent any permanent impacts and to develop and execute protection plans, including
implementation of artificial structures, such as bat boxes and artificial bark. These features replace potential roosting trees removed for project
development.
Eleven endangered species and five threatened species occupy habitat within EQT’ s operating area, covering Pennsylvania, West Virginia
and Ohio. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects at least 25 different species that use EQT’s core operating area as either breeding grounds
or seasonal habitat. Additionally, the Eagle Act protects the Bald and Golden Eagles, which nest in the area. The following table summarizes
the species of concern located within EQT’s core operating area.

30ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE
Air Quality
AIR QUALITY
TOPIC DESCRIPTION
Managing and minimizing air emissions (volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, etc.) across EQT’ s value chain.
Why Managing It Matters
103-1
Our operational emissions can affect local air quality in the areas where we operate. By carefully tracking and inspecting our local air  
emissions and sources, we are better positioned to identify tools and processes to improve our systems. As we work to reduce local air  
emissions, we contribute to a healthier environment, lessening our impact on local communities. Further , a compliant emissions program  
enables EQT to protect air quality and maintain a positive reputation with local communities and regulators, which can streamline permitting  
for new facilities.
Management Approach
103-2
EQT monitors our operational air emissions to comply with relevant regulations. Our Environmental Management System (EMS) collects data  
for every station, calculates emissions based on monthly data and informs the continuous improvement of our processes and procedures.  
Generally, each individual permit requires inventories of such data tracking; and in some cases, we have actively tracked inventories dating  
back to 1991.
Governance
EQT’s Environmental Department, led by our Corporate Director, Environmental Affairs, is responsible for the oversight and management of  
all aspects of our environmental footprint. This department reports to the Vice President of Environment, Health and Safety and is ultimately  
guided by the Corporate Responsibility Committee of the board of directors. Within the Environmental Department, the air quality team is
responsible for air quality permitting, compliance and reporting. We report environmental progress — including emissions reports, notices of 
violations and obtained permits — to the EQT Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility Committee quarterly.
31SIGNIFICANT AIR EMISSIONS (KILOGRAMS)*
*All data exclude midstream operations. Data does not include emissions from facilities acquired from Rice Energy for the period of November 13, 2017 – December 31, 2017.
We do not track persistent organic pollutants (POP)
†NOx, SO x, PM, CO and Formaldehyde increases in 2018 were due to increased diesel fuel used on drilling and completions and more combustors installed. VOC/HAP
decreases were due to reductions in pneumatic devices and increased use of combustors to destroy VOC emissions.Permits and Monitoring
EQT must obtain operational permits, including air quality permits, prior to construction and operation in new locations. A strong air quality  
compliance record can streamline this process. Once obtained, our operations group reviews the permit and notes any future compliance  
responsibilities. We communicate the requirements to our field workers to ensure appropriate data is collected and uploaded into our EMS,  
which tracks our emissions, obligations, limits and air quality requirements. Our Environmental Department reviews the system monthly and  
identifies improvement processes for tracking and inputting information on an ongoing basis. 
Evaluating Our Approach
103-3
Audits and Reporting
EQT utilizes inspections and audits to review compliance obligations and improve our operations. Third-party audits occur annually for a  
selection of operating facilities. Our environmental group also conducts internal inspections on our facilities and sites. Our corporate auditing  
group periodically selects internal programs or processes to audit as well. In reviewing findings, lessons learned can be applied to similar  
facilities via a Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle of continuous improvement.
Additionally, emissions reporting obligations vary by state. Where required, EQT submits emissions reports and, in some cases, permit  
compliance certifications. We also send overview reports to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as report de minimis thresholds  
for relevant emissions.
Inspections and Benchmarking
EQT’s compliance personnel in each state inspect our work site locations regularly — including compressor stations, well pads and drilling  
sites — to evaluate air quality compliance. They also meet with state regulators to ensure we are aligned with state air quality regulations and  
we conduct periodic leak detection and repair. We benchmark our air emissions against our peers to identify potential improvement areas and  
evaluate what drives internal emissions across our operating regions.
305-7, SASB 120a.1
We strive to maintain 100% facility compliance with all permit requirements and emissions limitations, and we review any operational incidents  
and notices of violation. We utilize stack test data, manufacturers’ data and published emissions factors to calculate our significant air  
emissions.

Occupational Health and Safety
Why Managing It Matters
EQT places the highest priority on the safety of our workforce — both employees and contractors — as well as the communities where we
operate. We believe our operational excellence begins with our unwavering dedication to safety. We also believe safeguarding the health and
safety of EQT’s workers contributes to the success and longevity of our company. Further, investors and other stakeholders often view
occupational health and safety performance as a leading indicator of overall management performance.
Management Approach
EQT is committed to achieving superior safety performance every day . Through continuous improvement efforts, we provide a safe and
healthy workplace for our workers and strive to create and maintain a zero-injury culture. EQT does not prioritize business objectives above
safety objectives.  
EQT conducts our active business operations in accordance with the applicable health and safety requirements established by the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and other regulatory bodies. W e closely monitor our health and safety risks,
operations and statistics to ensure safe worksites, proper training and motivation to work safely . We work to continuously identify and evaluate
opportunities for improvement and believe that all EQT workers are accountable for ensuring a safe working environment and culture.
Governance
EQT’s Safety Department, led by our Vice President of Environment, Health and Safety, is ultimately guided by the Public Policy and
Corporate Responsibility Committee of the board of directors. EQT personnel conduct regular meetings with the company’ s senior leadership
team to review and analyze issues and provide direction to enhance overall safety performance.OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

35Employees are personally accountable for their individual safety and play a critical role in ensuring the safety of colleagues, contractors and
service providers. As part of the company’s overall corporate social responsibility performance objective, which is an annual metric, all EQT
employees have an individual “workplace safety” performance objective. In addition, safety is embedded in our employee short-term incentive
plan.
Environment, Health and Safety Policy
To emphasize the importance of occupational health and safety, EQT’s Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy underscores the
principles that guide us toward superior EHS performance. Health and safety highlights from our policy include:
EQT will provide and foster leadership to ensure all employees and contractors understand their responsibilities and that we provide all
employees with the training and support necessary to integrate EHS principles into their work.
We will manage our business to prevent incidents that could result in harm to people, communities, property or the environment.
We will commit the resources necessary for successful implementation of our EHS Policy.
Safety Management System and Risk Identification
EQT’s safety management system (SMS) enables the company to systematically identify and properly manage our workforce safety risk. It
covers all aspects of the company, our employees and contractors, and all locations — from drilling rigs to offices. The EQT SMS includes the
company’s Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy,  workforce safety information, awareness and training, safety procedures,
performance monitoring, safety verification processes and qualified safety experts to lead the process.
The core of EQT’s SMS is the identification, prioritization and management of our safety risk. Through EQT’s detailed risk and hazard analysis
(RHA) process, our objective is to relentlessly pursue, establish and sustain proper safeguards using a hierarchy of safety controls. Before any
fieldwork begins, the RHA requires a systematic safety review of the site construction plan and all daily onsite workforce activities. If a task is
deemed unsafe, everyone has the obligation and authority to stop such work without fear of retribution or discipline. T o ensure the RHA
functions properly, the company uses a multi-layered verification process — a qualified team of internal and external safety experts oversee
observation, testing, inspections and audits. Verification results are shared with EQT’s leadership team, and, if potential weaknesses are
identified, actions are taken to strengthen them. 
EQT encourages employees to communicate with management about issues or initiatives that could help improve overall performance.
Although this format does not require the establishment of formal joint management-employee committees, EQT has found the development
of these teams to be beneficial. For example, joint committees collaborated to update upstream equipment gas hazard spacing requirements,
enhance the risk quantification processes at operating well pads, and to install permanent lockout-tagout equipment stations on operating well
pads.
We set annual targets to reduce injury and vehicle accident rates. In addition, EQT prioritizes the reporting of near-miss incidents to help
identify common issues and prevent future incidents. In 2018, key near-miss lessons learned included prevention of dropped objects (potential
struck-by incidents), vehicle safety (potential for slow-moving vehicles to lose traction), and slips/falls during winter months. Our analysis also
revealed opportunities to prevent hand/finger injuries through the use of push/pull sticks and pipe rolling tools. Opportunities to prevent truck
rollovers on EQT lease/access roads were identified and include reducing vehicle speed, implementing unidirectional traf fic flow patterns and
requiring vehicles to avoid potential soft shoulders that may have been af fected by inclement weather.
As a responsible corporate citizen, EQT shares our best safety practices with our peers to help improve overall industry safety performance.
One example is EQT’s active membership in the ISNetworld ® Appalachian Working Group (AWG). The AWG constitutes a group of natural
gas producers that share safety-related best practices and innovations to improve safety performance within the Appalachian Basin.
ZiP Today
In June 2018, we launched a new safety culture program for our workers called ZiP T oday, an acronym for
“Zero is Possible – Today.” This program is emblematic of a safety culture wherein the EQT workforce
believes that each day presents a new opportunity for them to take an active role in living and working
safely — in the field, in the office and at home — with zero safety incidents.
The ZiP Today platform includes positive worker safety recognition, sharing of lessons learned and take-
home ZiP Today safety kits. In 2018, EQT sent two safety kits, including items such as safety glasses,
gloves, lip balms and hardhat stickers, directly to employee office mailboxes.
Through the ZiP Today platform, EQT employees are asked to commit to always making our safety, and
that of everyone around us, a top priority. In one instance, an employee took her ZiP Safety Kit home with
her and gave the safety glasses to her son to wear while doing yard work. A short while later , the sonreturned with a sizeable chip in his glasses; while weed whacking, a stone was launched toward his face 
and the glasses helped to protect his  eyes from that particular hazard.403-1, 403-2, 403-7

36Safety Training
Training, risk mitigation and performance monitoring form the core of EQT’s workplace safety initiatives. Every EQT employee — including
short-service employees — receives core safety training annually , along with more frequent specialized training tailored to the work performed
and the types of issues faced. EQT customizes specialized training subjects and delivery methods as needed. For example, monthly safety
meetings held with field employees cover issues such as:
On average, full-time EQT employees received approximately seven hours of safety training during 2018.
Training, risk mitigation and performance monitoring form the core of EQT’s
workplace safety initiatives.
Contractor Safety
With contractors making up approximately 90% of EQT’s total work hours, we recognize the importance of working with companies committed
to superior safety performance. A contractor expecting to perform services in drilling, construction, maintenance or other operations-related
activities at EQT must pass a qualification process (described below) and must agree to adhere to EQT’ s Contractor Safety Standard and
Contractor Safe Work Rules. These safety requirements, updated regularly to reflect best practices, apply to all work performed by a
contractor’s employees and the employees of their subcontractors.
EQT uses ISNETWorld ® — an industry-recognized platform for monitoring safety metrics and performance — to qualify contractors before
they obtain authorization to begin work for EQT. ISNETWorld ® provides vital information regarding a contractor’s performance in the following
key areas:
Within our Procurement Department, EQT’s Contract Administration group collaborates with the Safety Department to oversee all new
contractors' compliance with our standards and to carry out safety directives relative to contract status for existing suppliers. If a contractor
does not meet our expectations, Procurement collaborates with ISNetworld ® and the Safety Department to work with them to seek
improvement. If they do not improve, EQT terminates the contractor or places the contract on hold — and, in turn, Procurement recommends
a safer service provider. Existing contractors who fail to meet the rules and standards cannot continue to work on an EQT work site.
EQT remains engaged with our contractors as work evolves to ensure we achieve our joint commitment to safety . We track contractor safety
incident rates (injury and vehicle accidents) provided by contractors via ISNETW orld®, and our contractor safety auditing process is
incorporated in EQT’s contractor safety qualification program.
As part of EQT’s continuous improvement of our contractor safety management program, the company performed the following in 2018:
Traffic Safety
Through incident data and root cause analysis, we identify our most significant areas for improvement. Safe driving is an area of particular
concern for EQT. Our wellpad activities result in heavy truck traffic causing several-fold increases in truck traffic for surrounding communities.
EQT continued many fleet safety initiatives in 2018 to improve traf fic safety, including employee behind-the-wheel driver training, safe driver
initiatives, speed restrictions and vehicle curfews for contractor traf fic and enhanced enforcement.

For additional information regarding our road safety initiatives, see Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.
Occupational Health Services
Healthy employees are more adept at performing their roles safely . To this objective, our Medical Services team plays a key role ensuring the
occupational health of company employees, providing advice and teaming with the EQT Safety Department on repetitive motion hazards,
industrial hygiene results and the potential for elevated noise exposure. The Medical Services team is accessible to all EQT employees 24/7
each day of the year.
Evaluating Our Approach
Tracking and Reporting Accidents 
If a safety incident does occur, EQT records the nature of the event as prescribed by the OSHA injury/illness recordkeeping requirements in a
safety incident management database. After each incident, the company conducts a thorough incident review to clarify possible causes,
identify options to prevent recurrences and highlight opportunities to improve training, processes and procedures using the hierarchy of safety
controls. EQT personnel also conduct regular incident review meetings with senior management.403-3
103-3
38By tracking and analyzing safety incidents, we can assess the ef fectiveness of our approach to safety management and strive for continuous
improvement. We supplement our OSHA metrics with a Serious Injury and Fatality (SIF) metric. SIF incidents tracking allows us to better
assess our safety program’s progress and to detect increases in high potential consequence risk.
EQT develops safety bulletins to address safety incidents and to share lessons learned within our workforce. These bulletins describe the
incident and its impact to help inform, educate and prevent a future occurrence. They are distributed to appropriate functional groups based on
the topic of each bulletin.
Although the tracking of lagging indicators is important, we believe tracking leading indicators — such as near-miss incidents — is an equally
important way to improve safety performance. We require information concerning near-miss incidents to be reported and recorded in our
safety incident management database. Tracking and reporting near-miss incidents enables us to take actions to address at-risk behaviors and
workplace hazards.
In addition to the use of safety incident metrics, the company also uses several safety management verification processes to evaluate our
safety program:
Safety team inspection program
Safety team contractor safety auditing program
External (third-party experts) Safety Management System and worksite auditing program
We analyze all results from our safety verification programs for potential systemic causes. As a result, we establish actions to ensure
continuous and sustainable program improvement.
In 2018, EQT revised our Safety Incident Reporting and Investigation Program requirements. This standard provides tools and procedures for
classifying incidents and near misses; standardizes notification requirements and action timelines for incidents and near misses; and ensures
an appropriate investigation is conducted based on the severity of each incident. Additionally , EQT updated its suite of safety management
programs to ensure ongoing continuous improvement.
With expanded training, risk assessment and other preventive measures, EQT worker injuries — OSHA recordable incidents — declined in
2018. As part of EQT’s data analysis process, we identified that approximately 35% of EQT’s combined worker 2018 OSHA recordable
incidents were hand/finger injuries. To address this risk, EQT issued a mandatory workforce glove policy during the fourth quarter of 2018 and
initiated a hand/finger injury awareness program. In 2018, EQT experienced one employee ill health case. An employee working in the field
39experienced hearing loss and, as a result, we have increased awareness and education on noise hazards and the proper use of hearing
protection.
We establish contractor injury rates using hours recorded in ISNetworld ® by our contractors. The contractor rates are companywide, not
regionally based. EQT does not track contractor absentee rates or injury rates by gender . Three contractor ill health cases occurred in 2018:
two outdoor weather exposures (cold, heat) and one skin irritation case. Immediate actions were taken to address identified causes.

In the past two years, lost-time accidents have primarily been caused by moving objects (rig blocks, hose, cribbing) striking workers, finger
injuries from caught in/between equipment, or slip and fall incidents. In response, EQT issued a mandatory workforce glove policy during the
fourth quarter of 2018 and initiated a hand/finger injury awareness program. In 2019, we will update EQT workforce safety procedures and
training programs to further drive awareness and responsibility.

Exposure to outdoor weather (cold, heat) and skin irritation (e.g., poison ivy) pose the biggest risk of ill health for employees and contractors.
We have increased awareness and education on how to safely and effectively conduct outdoor activities and taken immediate action to
identify and address causes.
We were devastated by the deaths of two contractors in the company’s upstream operations in 2018. Both incidents occurred during water
truck hauling operations, and have spurred conversations to increase driver safety and awareness across the company . The number of
incidents related to our water hauler trucks declined steadily in 2018, in large part due to an increased focus on and investment in safe driving.403-9

In addition to the formal benefits package, we offer the EQT Take Charge wellness program, sponsored by one of the company's health
service providers as well as an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). T ake Charge offers personal health coaching, wellness information,
health management programs, newsletters and employee educational sessions conducted by medical professionals during work hours. The
program is designed to aid employees and their families in managing personal health and wellness issues. In addition, employees are eligible
to receive cash incentives from EQT by participating in approved online or telephone-based health coaching programs, smoking cessation
programs and pregnancy education.
Complementing Take Charge is our EAP, which offers additional wellness and lifestyle services, including confidential short-term counseling
and treatment programs and referrals to providers with expertise in family and relationship counseling, elder care, money management and
legal problems. EQT pays in full for up to five in-person counselor visits. Any employee, including those who waive our medical coverage, plus
anyone living in their household, can take advantage of the EAP and its additional resources.
At no cost to our employees, we offer annual on-site health screening, which enables employees to ask health-related questions during
consultation with a medical professional. We protect our employees’ privacy by ensuring that individual results remain confidential and third-
party providers supply only aggregated information for analysis purposes.
Training and Performance Reviews
Enhancing the skills and knowledge of our current workforce through trainings, degree programs and detailed performance reviews provides
our employees with the foundation they need to remain successful in their careers with EQT . All new employees complete an orientation
session where they learn about EQT’s culture, organization, benefits, leadership competencies, performance expectations and other available
resources to help them succeed from day one. Orientation also reinforces our commitment to workplace safety , ethical conduct and
environmental stewardship. Following orientation, employees receive additional training as needed to develop the skills necessary to perform
their job tasks safely and effectively.
We conduct mandatory and work-specific training and offer optional participation in seminars, workshops and certification programs to ensure
that employees are continually prepared for their job tasks. These training opportunities also bolster employee professional development to
ensure that core and technical skills remain current. Additionally , we conduct performance reviews for employees at all levels to understand
areas in which they can grow.
Employees continually work with their managers or supervisors to identify other appropriate training opportunities as they grow their careers
with EQT. We provide cross-functional rotational assignments, individual development plans and coaching, and in-house training to serve our
employees’ growth. Some employees may seek to expand their formal education, and our Education Assistance Program provides financial
assistance to those who enroll in degree programs and satisfy established grade requirements.
As EQT employees near the end of their careers, we also provide training and additional resources to aid them in the transition from active
employment. Our independent 401(k) plan administrator offers online courses, one-on-one meetings and telephone advice about retirement
options while our EAP offers courses and individual counseling sessions for those retiring or involuntarily terminating from the company. We
also help retiring employees navigate the digital health insurance marketplace as they seek to transition their health insurance providers.404-2
43Diversity, Inclusion and Employee Resource Groups
At EQT, we believe that employee diversity enhances the recruitment and retention of talented individuals as well as EQT’s overall success
and performance. We believe in recruiting the best available talent, including qualified racial and ethnic minorities, women, veterans, disabled
persons and LGBTQ candidates. Additionally, every employee has an annual performance objective to reinforce the importance of diversity
and to recognize that employee differences bring advantages to the workplace.
Since 2013, company sponsored Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) have provided support to employees with shared characteristics or life
experiences. ERGs are voluntary employee groups that advance the interests of their members and those of their common af filiation. They
provide additional opportunities for professional development by increasing access to senior management, allowing employees to work in
teams other than their own work group and promoting networking. As of December 31, 2018, there were five active ERGs: Multi-Ethnic,
Parents, Women in Energy, Developing Professionals and PRIDE.
Evaluating Our Approach
We review and evaluate our employment and diversity and inclusion programs on a regular basis. During these evaluations, we ensure
compliance with applicable laws and regulations and assess whether our programs remain competitive with the external labor market. When
reviewing our programs, we consider:
Our management team reviews these evaluations and may adjust existing programs or develop plans to address any areas of concern that
arise.

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
TOPIC DESCRIPTION
Incorporating innovation into EQT’s business strategy to increase operational efficiencies and reduce costs in a safer and more environmentally conscious manner.
Why Managing It Matters
103-1
EQT’s commitment to innovation allows us to reduce resource use and maintain cost- and time-saving efficiencies across our business, from  
construction to production and water management. With the integration of Rice Energy assets and operations in 2018, combined with the  
separation of our midstream business that created a premier pure play upstream corporation, we are even better positioned to leverage and  
expand the reach of new production-focused technologies and ideas.
Management Approach
103-2
Our commitment to innovation enables EQT to adapt to the fluctuating commodity price of natural gas, changes in the regulatory environment  
and advances in technology. Innovation creates efficient, cost-effective processes that increase production and improve the safety and  
environmental impact of our operations. Our dedication to technological innovation will help us maintain our status as the largest natural gas  
producer in the United States.
We strongly encourage innovation throughout the organization as it is fundamental to every aspect of our business.
48In 2018, EQT continued to analyze the use of data in our processes to determine where we can enhance ef ficiencies through technological
innovation. Throughout the past two years, our investments in Real-T ime Operations Centers (RTOCs) have built upon our existing systems
that transmit data from field locations to office personnel to optimize our operations. Centralized teams and in-house, real-time data review
have enabled teams to realize efficiencies by focusing on proactive decisions and preventative maintenance while minimizing the need for
costly reactive measures.
During 2018, our operational teams made substantial progress in the development of three centers: drilling, completions and production/water
operations.
Drilling RTOC
The Drilling RTOC began as a two-rig pilot program in 2017 and transitioned to a fully implemented operation by mid-year 2018. At this time,
100% of bottom-hole (horizontal) rigs were operated out of the center , meaning all lateral portions of EQT’s wells were remotely drilled in the
latter half of 2018. EQT is one of the first land-based operators to remotely drill 100% of our wells and, in total, EQT remotely drilled 2.1 million
lateral feet during 2018. By allowing the directional drilling and real-time data review to take place side-by-side, we are fostering increased
collaboration and enhanced oversight to guide responsible decision-making.
The Drilling RTOC has transformed the way we maximize asset value by providing:
Quality data to drive decisions
Optimized resource allocation
Enhanced collaboration
Reduced inefficiencies and failures
Minimized development and production costs103-3Real-Time Operating Centers
49Completions RTOC
Around the time that the Drilling RTOC became fully operational, EQT launched a proof of concept pilot for our Completions RTOC. This
program enables our teams to see completions data instantly, communicate transparently and make real-time decisions based on available
data. Throughout this pilot, we identified a significant degree of deviation in our completions design, which was not previously visible due to
lack of real-time completions information. While we still have substantial work ahead to develop a fully operational Completions R TOC, this
pilot allowed us to recognize the need for standardization across our well completions and helped identify best utilization practices for
chemical/material usage as well as improved horsepower.
Production Control Center
We implemented the Production Control Center (PCC) in 2018 as a result of the Work Management Optimization (WMO) program. During
2017, we identified the opportunity to enhance efficiencies in the way we operated our producing wells and, in 2018, implemented software to
better leverage our available workforce and equipment. In the past, our well operators worked within a specific, assigned daily route to perform
well maintenance and other pertinent duties. In 2018, we utilized a software system to issue work orders on an as-needed, prioritized basis,
streamlining where and when work was completed. Throughout the year , we tracked approximately 67,000 hours via work orders, which
provided an accountable, trackable method of work assignment.
To reduce the amount of downtime a well with operational issues may experience at any given time, the PCC and well operators focused on
providing immediate maintenance to those wells in a more efficient manner. This method reduced the average well downtime by more than
75%, ultimately allowing the well to return to production.
The PCC also manages our water operations. Natural gas development is water intensive (see Water ), and the PCC schedules the delivery of
water for completions activities and the pickup of produced water from well sites. Additionally , we are beginning to cross-train our employees
to be fluent in both production and water operations. Through the PCC, we have been able to reduce our cost per barrel, non-productive time
and staging time. This has led to 30% fewer EQT trucks on the road hauling the exact same amount of water .
Innovation Processes
In 2018, EQT’s internal innovation group piloted a new idea-sharing platform during a targeted campaign focused on artificial intelligence. This
group also launched an internal digital collaboration tool to collect general ideas. Several of the ideas submitted were explored and shared
with the business units for further assessment and implementation. In 2018, EQT focused on the shift from idea generation and submission to
an operational excellence model, wherein innovation is encompassed in our daily evaluation and thought process for each project. 
Throughout 2018, the internal innovation group focused on supporting groups across the company through facilitation rather than the
implementation of specific ideas. With a specific focus on helping teams capture costs, ef ficiencies, process improvements and other proactive
solutions, the group led more than 75 sessions across the business. Eventually , members of this group became absorbed into the asset
performance and data governance teams where they have continued to focus on finding both capital and operational ef ficiencies. Additionally,
the internal innovation group facilitated 77 creative problem-solving sessions across the company (in conjunction with the above-mentioned
sessions).
In 2018, EQT’s external innovation group evaluated 151 new technologies mainly focused on: completions, production operations, drilling,
water management, construction and design engineering. During this time, they initiated 1 1 pilot projects and ultimately incorporated three
new technologies into our operations. Subsequently, the members of the external innovation team have also been integrated into business
unit teams for information technology, asset optimization and the Drilling RTOC.
50In the Community
At EQT, we strive to work in harmony with the communities where we operate through our values of trust, teamwork, heart and evolution. We
understand that our license to operate is rooted in our relationships with communities, especially when it comes to safety and other concerns.
To safeguard local communities’ well-being in alignment with our operational needs, we have established channels to discuss and address
concerns, engage in political activity, donate funding and resources, and educate community members on various aspects of our business.
Through these engagements, we develop strong relationships that benefit both EQT and our communities.TOPICS COVERED

Local Communities
Why Managing It Matters
Local communities continue to be essential to the success and long-term growth of EQT’ s business operations. Our operations affect nearby
communities, so it is important that EQT conducts business and performs related operations with the support, trust, alignment and cooperation
of our local communities.
Management Approach, Performance and Evaluation
EQT values the communities where we operate, and we focus on three areas to support and engage with them: managing our impacts,
various forms of investment and being a good community citizen. As EQT strives to operate responsibly , we work to build trust by sharing
information associated with our current, planned and proposed operations. Through public engagement, education, corporate giving and
volunteering, we are better able to continue operating as a responsible natural gas producer .
Addressing Local Community Concerns and Public Perceptions
Increased truck traffic, road impacts, noise, dust, lights and 24/7 operations associated with the construction of wellpads, active drilling and the
completion of wells are examples of concerns among local communities in our operating area. The size of a wellpad dictates the amount of
time required to prepare and build the site but at minimum construction takes 120 days before drilling operations commence.LOCAL COMMUNITIES
TOPIC DESCRIPTION
Managing impacts on and relations with the communities in which EQT operates. This includes the impacts of the transportation of materials, impacts on roads, noise
pollution and specific community complaints or concerns. Our financial, educational and other support of communities is also addressed by this topic.

52Prior to construction, EQT’s Land Department engages with surface owners 5 where a site is planned to ensure mutual agreement on its  
location. Access to wellpads can be located near or shared with community neighbors and can lead to temporary heavy traf fic and operations  
near local residences. The construction phase and increased truck traf fic may produce noise from engine brakes, dust from dirt roads, lights  
from night operations and road impacts from high traffic volumes.
To better understand these concerns, our Local Government and Community Af fairs Specialists — regionally based EQT employees — are  
responsible for establishing and maintaining relationships with civic organizations, elected of ficials, emergency response personnel, business  
owners, residents and other local stakeholders. In 2018, these specialists worked closely with EQT’ s Land, Permitting, Construction and Legal  
Departments, among others, to report concerns and engagement outcomes.
We use our awareness of community concerns to establish policies and procedures designed to minimize or eliminate many operational  
issues before they become disputes. For example, during the past several years, we have evaluated issues related to how our operations  
might affect nearby residents and businesses in more densely populated areas and worked to proactively mitigate any potential concerns. We 
also collaborate with counties and municipalities affected by truck traffic and associated road impacts from our operations to mitigate the  
burden on local economies. See 203-1: Infrastructure investments and services supported below .
As most o f EQT’s visible workforce is contractor-based, the  contracted company holds responsibility for worker behavior. That said, EQT will 
only contract with companies that share our values and commitment to the community .
The majority of our contractors hold daily safety meetings to address appropriate behaviors and minimize impacts on the local community . 
EQT works closely with our contractors to ensure removal or discipline of a worker on a case-by-case basis if recurring issues arise.
Our conscious efforts to understand and collaborate with local communities support our desire to become our industry’s operator of choice.  
We strive to communicate with all impacted community members and provide education of issues related to the natural gas industry. Our 
Local Government and Community Affairs Specialists demonstrate EQT’s commitment by:
Gathering information to help EQT identify local concerns before they inconvenience neighbors
Advocating for the community by ensuring that issues or concerns are addressed at the appropriate level within the company and ultimately
achieve resolution
Acting as a conduit for suggesting ways to strengthen EQT’s processes and procedures
Providing an accessible local point of contact for residents to learn about current or future projects and how they may af fect their
communities
Building relationships prior to the start of activity in new areas
Giving Back in Big Ways on
#GivingTuesday
#GivingTuesday, celebrated the Tuesday after Thanksgiving in the U.S., is a
global day of giving fueled by the power of social media and collaboration. In
2018, EQT and the EQT Foundation joined the movement by creating a full-
day of service and philanthropic activities in our communities. EQT
volunteered in the office and community, hand delivered checks to local
nonprofits and municipalities, and donated a repurposed ice cream truck to a
local food bank. The EQT Foundation matched qualifying charitable
contributions made by EQT employees on a two-for-one basis. The company
took to social media (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) using the hashtags#EQTGivesBack and #GivingTuesday to generate interest and encouraged 
employees to do the same.
In total, EQT Foundation granted more than $269,000 to nonprofits through  
its two-for-one matching contributions.  Additionally, EQT donated $25,500 to  
local nonprofits and municipalities. Nearly 50 employees participated in  
volunteer  programs.
5 Although EQT’s operations currently do not impact Native American/Indigenous communities, EQT is committed to working with these groups if/when applicable.
53EQT maintains an internal database to track all concerns raised to the Local Government and Community Af fairs Specialists and includes
elements from identification through resolution. The database enables EQT to avoid issue recurrence by assessing lessons learned. Annually ,
we analyze the results to identify trends in performance, benchmark against previous data and help determine any required procedural
changes. We also conduct an annual survey targeted to local elected officials and community leaders to gauge performance and reputation.
We utilize this information for internal review and improvement opportunities.
All regions within EQT’s Marcellus and Utica operations participated in organization-wide local community engagement, impact assessment
and development programs in 2018.

54Public Relations and/or Government Affairs leaders approve the majority of corporate donations to local communities. We follow a routine
review and pre-approval process to avoid support of illegal or otherwise inappropriate activities. EQT donations support a variety of
organizations ranging from small local nonprofits to municipalities seeking additional support for community projects that exceed their budgets.
Other types of corporate support include sponsorships of county fairs, community festivals and other local events. Our support enables EQT to
bond with our neighbors, enhance the quality of life for residents, educate residents about our company and industry , and provide an
opportunity for our fellow community members to meet EQT employees.
Highlights from our 2018 local giving and corporate sponsorship initiatives included:
$30,000 to Greene County, Pennsylvania, for the extension of the Greene River Trail along the Monongahela River
$15,000 to sponsor the Washington and Greene County Covered Bridge Festival in Pennsylvania, a festival that brings the communities in
the core of our operations together to celebrate local heritage
$10,000 to Waynesburg Borough, Pa., to support the purchase of a new police vehicle
$10,000 to Give Belmont County, a community enrichment fund in our newly acquired operating area in Ohio
$7,000 to the Village of Bethesda, Ohio, Police Department for body and vehicle cameras
The EQT Foundation also provides funding for communities in and near EQT’ s operating areas. The EQT Foundation’s board reviews all grant
applications submitted by a qualifying nonprofit organization; all applications must comply with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to
corporate foundations. In line with corporate support, foundation grants help to build relationships throughout EQT’ s operational footprint. In
2018, the EQT Foundation supported local programming in five main funding priority areas:
Arts and Culture
Community and Economic Development
Diversity
Education
Environment
55The Foundation periodically adjusts its funding priorities to ensure that its funding strategy matches the evolving needs of the communities
where EQT operates. The EQT Foundation gave more than $7.7 million in 2018 to support local communities. Examples of the 2018 EQT
Foundation grant recipients include:
EQT’s corporate giving, sponsorships and road and infrastructure improvements for communities totaled more than $11 million in 2018, while
EQT Foundation provided nearly $8 million in grants and contributions.

Public Safety and Emergency
Preparedness
Why Managing It Matters
The safety of the communities where we operate, and that of EQT’ s employee and contractor workforce, is a top priority for the company .
Natural gas is a safe and reliable energy form; however, as with the extraction of any form of energy, precautions must be taken in the design
of wells, extraction processes and driving to and from sites. We set precautionary standards and work closely with our communities to prevent
and prepare for all possible emergencies. Our communities rely on safe, responsible operation of wellpads, employee safety training and
regular communications to minimize safety incidents.
Management Approach
Beyond EQT’s commitment to provide a safe and healthy workplace for our employees and contractors (see Occupational Health and Safety
for information), we maintain and operate equipment responsibly to create a safe environment in the communities where we operate. EQT’ s
emergency management efforts focus on prevention, preparedness and response.
We provide safety awareness and emergency response protocols for communities, establish well designs and processes that prioritize safety,
manage traffic and provide safe driver training. Our formal Environment, Health and Safety Policy  outlines our safety commitment and
expectations for our employees and contractors.PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
TOPIC DESCRIPTION
Ensuring the health and safety of the communities in which EQT operates through careful wellpad construction, production activity and lifecycle impact assessments;
anticipating and having programs in place for crisis or emergency situations.
103-1
103-2
58Emergency Response Preparation
Operating units develop site-specific emergency action and response plans to prepare for significant risks. Before daily field operations begin,
each team must focus on hazard prevention and prepare for an emergency situation by leading a tailgate safety meeting. The Crisis
Management team — in conjunction with the Environmental and Safety Departments — provides guidance and expertise in emergency
response and crisis management. These functions also develop and maintain emergency notification procedures, training and support.
EQT’s Crisis Management team conducts annual drills to prepare for a range of scenarios that may affect the company. EQT also contracts
with experts to provide immediate support in such areas as well control, firefighting and spill response. W e investigate and learn from all
emergency situations to continuously improve our processes, preparedness and response.
Public Safety Awareness
EQT recognizes that our operations can affect the communities in which we operate. We uphold safety as our number one priority by regularly
communicating with our communities to increase awareness of our activities and address potential safety concerns. W e work closely with
emergency response personnel, public works employees, elected of ficials, school districts and other key community members to engage them
in the process, provide factual information, learn from them and build relationships.
Most often, the awareness and subsequent conversations surround:
Identification of the activity occurring at a local job site
The types of equipment being used
The most appropriate response for various scenarios
EQT’s emergency or crisis response planThrough these interactions, EQT and our communities are better prepared to jointly respond in the event safety-related incidents occur . Local 
officials and first responders become familiar with EQT’s operations and feel more comfortable contacting EQT should an incident or issue  
arise. Our conversations educate them on what they should and should not do to help EQT resolve an incident quickly and safely . In addition 
to streamlining the response process to a potential safety incident, these engagements build trust and establish lasting relationships.
Road Safety
A common local community concern is the impact of increased vehicle traf fic on municipal roads from our operations vehicles. Over the years,  
we established routines and trainings to mitigate these concerns and reduce safety incidents. When designing construction routes to job sites,  
we carefully consider the locations of schools, recreation areas and local population. W e base our initial route considerations on safety, which 
can necessitate longer drives on local roads used by residents. Often, route options are limited to reach a site, so we work with local  
governments and school districts to maximize the community’s safety and protection. We curtail traffic on roads traveled by school buses and  
place custom signs along our active truck routes, alerting our drivers and contractors that truck travel is prohibited during school bus pick-up  
and drop-off times. These signs also alert the community to slow down and watch for children.
Vehicle safety is included in both our employee and contractor safety expectations, and our Contractor Safe Work Rules include a section on  
safe vehicle operation. At established Marcellus and Utica job sites, we develop a mandated T raffic Control Plan, which we distribute to  
employees, contractors and subcontractors. These plans outline our specified speed limits, curfews and route restrictions. W e actively monitor  
compliance with our Traffic Control Plans and take prompt action to address reported violations. We utilize private road monitors with law  
enforcement backgrounds to continuously surveil our truck traffic once construction begins. The road monitors use radar-equipped vehicles  
and take necessary corrective action if EQT-related traffic creates unsafe driving conditions. They also investigate community complaints  
regarding any employee or contractor violations. To ensure contractor accountability, we may require contractor vehicles to have GPS systems  
in their vehicles so we can access their data.
Our Safe Driving Leadership Team, consisting of representatives from Safety, Legal, Human Resources and relevant business unit leaders,  
develops and updates policies, such as Fleet Safety Procedures, that uphold the safety of our employees and local communities. EQT acts to  
limit vehicle-related accidents by requiring employees assigned to a company vehicle to complete a comprehensive set of driver training  
programs and procedures regarding potential hazards and how to avoid them. During orientation, employees learn how to operate a vehicle  
safely, to be aware of common road hazards, and the best methods to avoid the most common types of accidents.
We work closely with driving safety and industry experts to reduce risk when operating an EQT vehicle. Both new and experienced drivers  
must demonstrate their safe driving skills through a periodic supervisor-observation session. New employees undergo a series of computer-
based training programs and behind-the-wheel training, including a defensive driving module. W e provide additional instruction for those  
employees operating specialty vehicles or haul trailers, performing of f-road travel or driving construction vehicles on public roads. One such  
course is a U.S. Department of Transportation training, which enables drivers to cross state lines and remain in compliance.
We require contractors to record miles driven for EQT in ISNETWorld ® to establish contractor preventable vehicle accident rates. EQT’s  
employees and contractors drove a combined distance of nearly 100 million miles in 2018 6. For more information regarding our initiatives to  
enhance vehicle safety for our contractors and employees, see Occupational Health and Safety.SASB 540a.2
6 Includes Midstream business unit contractor miles driven.
59Traffic Control Plan
EQT’s Traffic Control Plan is designed to protect the people in the communities we serve and ensure that our workforce has the proper  
directions to each of our locations. The plan requires EQT traffic — both employees and contractors — to follow designated routes, EQT  
speed limits and school bus curfew times throughout our operating area. Speed limit signs apply to all EQT traf fic, including pickups, SUVs,  
construction vehicles and tractor-trailers. Our school bus curfews apply to vehicles with three or more axles and prohibit them from driving on  
routes during the times of day when schoolchildren are being picked up or dropped of f. Additionally, we use road monitors to ensure that the  
plan is being followed as they monitor for proper route usage, speed and curfews.
Several collaborating parties developed the information in the plan. First, our Construction group determines the best routes to locations and  
our Land group obtains the required bonding and permitting of the roadways. Our Safety team then works with the thirty-six school districts in  
our operating area to determine the best bus curfew times for each route. The plan is sent to employees and contractors who work in the field  
so they can reference it as they travel to and from each site. EQT has received compliments from the school districts who very much  
appreciate the fact that we work hard to keep the roads safe for the children (and all drivers). One of the transportation directors told us that he  
calls EQT the “poster company” for how companies should operate in his school district.
Evaluating Our Approach

Safety Incidents
419-1, OG13
We track safety incidents to determine the effectiveness of our management approach. EQT experienced one Tier 1 Process Safety event in  
2018 when an unexpected pocket of natural gas was encountered during drilling activities that caused a release and site evacuation. No  
injuries were sustained. EQT received a notice of violation from the Pennsylvania Department of Environment for the Tier 1 natural gas  
release. Corrective actions taken included equipment modification, procedure updates and an expanded verification process check.

Indirect Economic Impacts
Why Managing It Matters
EQT's operations have a significant influence on the local economies where we operate by supporting economic growth via job creation and
tax revenue generation. Intentional management of our positive impacts enables us to build strong relationships with our communities and
lessen the United States’ reliance on foreign energy.
Management Approach, Performance and Evaluation
EQT tracks the indirect economic impacts of our business operations to better understand and communicate how our operations contribute to
the economy. We annually commission an independent analysis of the direct and indirect economic impacts of our activities on both local and
U.S. economies. Sustainability consulting firm ERM analyzed our year-end 2018 data and compiled the results into a study entitled, “EQT
Corporation 2018 Economic Impact Analysis.”
Supporting National and Local Economies
As a domestic energy company, EQT provides abundant, easily accessible, affordable natural gas to the United States, lessening the
country’s reliance on other nations for energy. This reduces overall energy prices and helps to increase national security.INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS

61According to ERM’s analysis, we provided $4.66 billion in value-added contributions to the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Of this $4.66
billion in economic benefits:
82.5%of contributions occurred in six states where EQT operates
17.5% of contributions related to out-of-state suppliers that provided goods and services for operational activities in EQT’ s operating area
EQT GDP CONTRIBUTIONS (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
Our direct activities produced approximately $2 billion of GDP, and the indirect GDP impact through our suppliers was $643 million. Our total
induced impact — that is, the impact of spending by EQT employees, contractors and suppliers — was approximately $2 billion.
EQT ECONOMIC IMPACT (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
Labor Impacts
We also generate revenue for the communities and states where we live and work through job and wealth creation. Our operations — all in
the U.S. — support local economies via taxes paid, road infrastructure improvements, local hiring of personnel and through use and support of
local service establishments. We provide millions of dollars in royalty payments to our mineral owners and sustain local jobs for employees,
direct contractors and suppliers to support our daily operational activities.
In addition to EQT’s direct employees, we supported approximately 23,000 ancillary jobs across our operations in 2018 — a 58% decrease
over our 2017 operations; however, the 2018 analysis excluded data from our midstream business unit, whereas the 2017 report included
operations across both upstream and midstream operations. This in cludes direct contractors — who make up most of EQT’s visible workforce
— suppliers and supply chain employees who support our production, gathering and transmission activities.203-2

Supporting Local and Diverse Suppliers
Our board of directors and management team support a strategic sourcing approach in which we seek out small and diverse local suppliers
whenever possible to strengthen EQT’s ability to deliver high performance to our customers and communities. We consider diverse suppliers
as those that are Minority Business Enterprises (MBE), Women’s Business Enterprises (WBE) and/or Veteran Owned Businesses (VOB). We
identify these suppliers through collaboration with regional and national councils such as the African American Chamber of Commerce of
Western Pennsylvania and the National Minority Supplier Development Council.  We also work with coalitions such as the Women’s Business
Enterprise National Council and the American Association of Blacks in Energy.
Further, we encourage our top vendors to consider diverse subcontractors as it helps these businesses develop relevant experience and
expand business opportunities that may not be directly possible with EQT . Our targeted procurement initiatives include:
Encouraging top suppliers to seek out and include diverse businesses in their bids and as part of their proposed solution
Giving greater consideration to vendors who complete and submit a subcontracting document with their proposal identifying where and how
they will utilize diverse vendors as part of the bidding process50000

In 2018, we spent 82.5% of our procurement budget on suppliers physically located within EQT’ s operational footprint. We sponsored or
participated in outreach events to target local and diverse suppliers including:
Regional Matchmaker Events: designed to connect diverse suppliers with corporations and EQT’ s majority-owned top suppliers for
potential business opportunities, in its seventh consecutive year , EQT successfully encouraged 62 of its majority-owned top suppliers to
attend and participate in over four hundred one-on-one meetings with diverse vendors

64IN THE COMMUNITY
Political Involvement and Public Policy
Why Managing It Matters
EQT serves as an informed resource to U.S. policymakers on issues directly af fecting the activities of EQT and those of the natural gas
industry in general. This engagement supports fair and balanced laws and regulations that benefit all EQT stakeholders. Our political
involvement and public policy activities are limited to the United States.
Management Approach
To benefit local communities and protect the interests of EQT, we engage with state and local politicians regarding issues that affect our
operations and communities. Our expertise in natural gas production enables us to have meaningful discussions around energy policy .
Governance
EQT conducts our public policy activities in compliance with applicable local, state and federal laws. Additionally , the EQT Public Policy and
Corporate Responsibility (PPCR) Committee of the EQT board of directors periodically evaluates these activities. The PPCR Committee
reviews and receives reports regarding EQT’s approach to public policy matters, including corporate political spending, diversity, environment,
health and safety, and energy policy.
Policies
EQT has internal policies that help manage our interactions with regulatory agencies and elected of ficials. We require, among other things,
that no employee engage in lobbying activity on behalf of EQT nor use corporate treasury dollars for political purposes without permission
from our General Counsel. The PPCR Committee annually reviews all contributions made to political candidates and discusses public policy
issues that affect the company.POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY
TOPIC DESCRIPTION

65Political Spending and Policy Issues
We comply with laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we are active politically. This includes federal and state campaign finance laws
regarding political spending in support of political parties, politicians and related institutions.
We do not engage in political activity or make financial or in-kind contributions to political parties, politicians or related institutions outside the
United States. We fund our political spending through:
EQT Employees Federal Political Action Committee (PAC), sourced solely from the voluntary contributions of EQT employees
EQT Employees Pennsylvania State PAC, sourced from voluntary employee contributions and transfers from the EQT Employees Federal
PAC
EQT corporate treasury dollars
We also work to support federal, state and local policies that promote stable investment climates for natural gas exploration, production,
storage and transportation. These may include policies governing environmental protection, taxes, natural gas production, transportation and
expanding the use of natural gas in sectors such as transportation, manufacturing and electricity generation. When engaging with
policymakers, we consider the impacts to EQT, our stakeholders, communities and the environment.
Evaluating Our Approach
EQT continues to work with legislators and regulators to help create policies and regulations that further natural gas development. EQT’ s
political engagement in local municipal, township and county elections continues to grow as our business operations expand into new areas.
In 2018, EQT provided guidance to legislators regarding the following legislative issues:
Post-production deductions — Pennsylvania and West Virginia
Joint development and co-tenancy — West Virginia
Severance tax — Pennsylvania
Energy infrastructure
To this end, the EQT Employees Federal PAC, EQT Employees Pennsylvania State PAC and EQT treasury dollars contributed $609,400 to
political spending, as shown below.

67About This Report
Corporate Responsibility at EQT
With a rich history in the Appalachian Basin, EQT Corporation has built a solid foundation within the energy industry — and we have a bright
future ahead of us. EQT strives to operate with our values at the forefront of all we do, and we are dedicated to producing natural gas in a
safe, environmentally responsible manner, operating ethically, supporting our workers and deepening our relationships with the communities in
which we live and work. By focusing on trust, teamwork, heart and evolution, we empower our employees to live our values each day .
This year’s report, The Future is Bright , is a testament to our focus on safety and operational accountability — all captured within the lens of
our strategically implemented mission, vision and values.  The Future is Bright is EQT’s eighth annual corporate social responsibility report.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards – Core option. T o demonstrate our
commitment to communicate transparently, it also covers numerous additional GRI disclosures, as well as some Disclosing the Facts (DtF)
and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)  disclosures for Oil and Gas – Exploration and Production.
Informing this Report
EQT conducted a materiality assessment in early 2017 to strategically guide our sustainability reporting. This assessment used the GRI steps
of Identification, Prioritization and Validation to rank the environmental, social and governance topics most critical to the company and our
external stakeholders. To first identify a universe of relevant topics, we benchmarked peer reports, regulatory and industry trends, reporting
frameworks and other stakeholder- related sources. We prioritized these topics by conducting interviews with leaders of EQT’s business units
and functional groups, as well as analyzing internal financial documents and peer , investor, community, regulatory, industry association and
media documents for evidence to support the relative importance of each topic. A customized weighting process demonstrated the importance
of each source. Our Corporate Communications team validated the customized weighting and topics most critical for EQT to manage and
report. This process further defined the boundary of each topic. T o learn more about our materiality assessment process, see our 2017
Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
While we will continue to monitor and manage all topics raised through the assessment, this report focuses on the 1 1 highest ranking or
“material” topics shown below plus the topics of Climate Strategy and T echnological Innovation, which we believe are also important to our
stakeholders. Throughout this report, EQT uses the GRI definition of “material” to reference topics that reflect the company’ s significant
economic, environmental and social impacts or that substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders. EQT did not use
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s concept of materiality within the context of this report.
We completed the separation of our upstream and midstream businesses on November 12, 2018, with the spinoff of the standalone company,
Equitrans Midstream Corporation (NYSE: ETRN). Following the spin-of f, EQT became a premier pure play production company with a
renewed focus on its upstream operations. EQT plans to refresh our materiality assessment in the near future to reflect the company’ s sole
focus on upstream operations for the report that will disclose activities from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.102-46
68Key Topics and Boundary
The table below lists the topics that ranked highest through our 2017 materiality assessment. Each topic
provides EQT’s description and interested or affected stakeholder groups. We anticipate refreshing our

Stakeholder Engagement
Reaching Out to Our Stakeholders
EQT’s stakeholders — those most interested in, and affected by, the company’s operations — provide valuable feedback from a variety of
perspectives. As an organization committed to operating responsibly , EQT monitors stakeholder interests specific to the company and to the
broader natural gas industry. We engage with stakeholders, not for reporting purposes, but as part of our effort to continuously improve.
Many of EQT’s stakeholders share similar, broad-based concerns about the natural gas industry overall; however, select individual groups
may have specific concerns about the manner in which we conduct our business operations. Although stakeholder areas of interest or concern
vary widely, EQT believes in maintaining an open and honest dialogue with our stakeholders as we have for decades.
Based upon our experience over time and our ongoing connections with stakeholders, EQT has developed specific methods of response that
are designed to meet our stakeholders’ diverse expectations and engagement preferences. The table below sets forth EQT’ s integrated
engagement strategies and frequencies for each of the named stakeholder groups — and provides links to our Management Approach and
Performance for each topic covered in this report.
