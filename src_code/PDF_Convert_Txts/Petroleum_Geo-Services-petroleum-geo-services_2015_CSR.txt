CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015This 4th PGS responsibility report is written in a period of change for our 
industry. A significant and continued slide in the price of oil has put pressure  
on companies at all levels of the oil and gas value chain to cut the costs  
of exploration and production. Our clients have delayed or dropped many projects, and competition has been fierce for the work that remains.  
As a result, we have put a very challenging year behind us. 
We believe that PGS has taken the right measures to adapt to a future that 
has already started, and is ready to survive and win in this new environment. Achieving that has required us to take tough decisions, prioritize and focus. In times such as these it is important that we continue to act responsibly, with regard to our people and society, our environment and our stakeholders. Although we have streamlined our operations to increase their efficiency,  safety and security remain in focus. 
Our business is about more than goals, numbers and technology. It depends  
on people. If you are one of them, then I would be very interested to hear  your views on how we can stay responsible and sustainable in tough times,  and even improve.

is faced with a clear imperative to eliminate unessential expenses, standards must be maintained in key areas. Responsibility is one of these.3
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015People
Dedicated, reliable, pioneer: these are our 
core values. They describe many aspects of our business, including how we relate to our employees and what we expect in return.
In a tough market some people might question the commitment 
to such laudable goals. Sticking to our standards, delivering as promised and creative thinking remain central to our culture.  
These values drive our processes, management style, and attitude. Proof of commitment is visible in the results of employee surveys,  
and our quarter-on-quarter HSEQ performance.

PGS strives to improve gender diversity in our recruiting and training programs. For office personnel 
the gender percentage largely reflects the recruiting sources. For offshore personnel some departments have up to 14 % women, but the five or six week work schedule proves unsustainable for many women.5

Revision of Core Values
The PGS Core Values provide the foundation for all our goals, policies and actions. The values offer clear guidelines on how we expect everyone at PGS to interact with their colleagues, suppliers, customers and the people we encounter in our day-to-day work.
During 2015 we revitalized words we use to describe our 
values, to make the basic tenets clearer. We involved senior and middle management, as well as employees from all regions and business areas to check that the key messages still reflected who we are and what we stand for as a company.
Dedicated
We care for our employees, our environment,  
our customers' success
We are leaders in HSEQ
We work as a team to get the best results
We act in the best interest of PGS
Reliable
We behave with integrity and honesty in all aspects  of our business
We deliver on our promises
We are best in class
We execute on time and on budget
Pioneer
Our technologies set the pace and standard in our industry
We innovate to compete and stay ahead
We dare to be proactive – even at the risk  of some failures
Looking ahead, in 2016 we intend to cement this process by recognizing and celebrating good examples of individuals, teams and projects that demonstrate PGS core values.
Reducing staff and costs with the human perspective  
in mind Since late 2014 the number of vessels in the PGS fleet was reduced, primarily driven by a strongly deteriorating market. 
After years of planned and actual growth, last year we 
found ourselves in a situation where we had too many crew and office staff for the number of active vessels. We had to downsize to stay competitive. 
Any downsizing process has severe consequences for the 
people involved, and uncertainty increases that burden. Knowing this, PGS committed to managing a fair, structured and timely process while adhering to our core values. 
Management deemed it essential that all crew and office 
staff understood why the changes were required. This was done through consistent and frequent information using various means of communications. Unions were also kept informed and involved before all major decisions were taken.
The selection criteria were based on a mix of employment 
seniority, performance, critical competencies and process risk.
The primary learnings from the process include: 
Even when employees were worried about their jobs, 
they delivered reliable services with high quality, and maintained the best safety statistics in the industry
Plans and time-lines need to be constantly re-evaluated to maintain coordination with domestic labor laws and special personnel issues in a truly international process
Seeing the results of the 2014 People SurveyThe most recent Global People Survey was conducted in 2014. It showed good results in most areas compared to benchmarks. Several actions for further improvement were initiated during 2015.
One Culture is a continuing initiative within Operations,  
to streamline how we manage operational risk and strengthen cross-functional cooperation. In 2015 we aligned and clarified roles and responsibilities for offshore employees. You can read more about One Culture on p.10.
In 2015 Imaging & Engineering strengthened the focus 
on training and development by introducing mandatory training hours for geophysical staff at all levels. They have also been one of the main drivers in developing the PGS Career Framework.
During 2015 we evolved a PGS Career Framework to 
enhance opportunities for professional and personal development across the organization. By mapping how 
positions are related to each other in a hierarchical 
structure, we have constructed a career framework that will make it easier to see what is required to move between roles. This should facilitate career moves within and between business areas. An initial rollout will begin in 2016.
Duty of care – travel risk program revitalized 
PGS has taken a significant step towards a comprehensive travel risk management program, to ensure proper mitigation of risk for travelers. We have established a travel 8
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015risk management team coordinating the approval process 
for high-risk destinations and monitoring travelers. 
These subject matter experts focus on travel risks and 
mitigation, supporting management and travelers during the planning stage and the journey. All travelers to high risk destinations undergo a comprehensive preparation and approval process. A range of tools are used to monitor and manage travelers. This checklist is designed to raise awareness of potential risks and possible actions to  
avoid them.
Regional travel trackers in different time zones contribute 
to risk mitigation, business continuity, and agile emergency response.
Additionally, targeted risk-awareness training is delivered 
by HSEQ staff.Travel to high risk areastold by Martin Melhus, Regional Manager PGS signed an agreement in June 2015, which required frequent travel to a high risk country. In response to the elevated overall risk rating, business unit managers met with the risk management team to review the situation and agree on appropriate measures to mitigate potential hazards. Liaising with local PGS representatives and a security consultant, specific procedures and a journey management system were established.
Upon arrival and before departure I had to check 
in with a local PGS contact. I stayed at the recommended hotel, and all land transportation was carried out using PGS cars and drivers. In addition, I had a tracking app installed on my phone, and an agreement to call my line manager daily for the duration of the stay.
A mitigation and recovery plan was in place to 
ensure deviations from the travel plan were properly managed. The plan included finding a safe location, ensuring everyone is accounted for, and routines for notification to relevant parties.Case Example:9
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015HSEQ leadership 
Through explicit management commitment and leading by example, PGS aims to be best-in-class in health, safety, environment and quality. Our goals are zero injuries to people, including employees, contractors and visitors; and minimum impact on the environment. Risk management is at the heart of how we manage our business and how we manage HSEQ. We embed risk thinking – awareness and mitigation – in all our operations from the boardroom to the back deck. 
It is not possible or practical to make procedures for 
everything. Empowering our people to think for themselves and to act according to the risks that they are faced with is an important aspect of  our approach to HSEQ.
Key Safety Risks
We rely on our safety management systems to control  the whole spectrum of risks we face at our work sites.  The areas where we encounter the highest potential for injuries require our greatest attention. Key Safety Risks supported by Key Safety Controls target PGS’ most significant focus areas. Together these form the foundation for effective management of safety in all our workplaces.
In 2015 PGS developed its “Key Safety Risks” building 
on and revitalizing our Golden Rules of Safety. Feedback indicated that the content was too comprehensive, and did not fully reflect our most important challenges. By changing the focus from rules to risks, we encourage people to be aware, plan ahead and think. This risk-based approach resonates well with our employees. 
By recognizing the importance of PGS Key Safety Risks, 
employees are encouraged to take responsibility for their own safety and that of their colleagues.
Long-term improvement 
We aim to be frontrunners in health, safety, environment and quality (HSEQ) and we work continuously towards this goal. This ambition drives various long-term improvement initiatives, including.
Embedding risk thinking – Our work with risk management contributes to improved HSEQ performance. In 2015, we saw the lowest Total Recordable Case Frequency (TRCF) in ten years and achieved a record five months without a recordable injury in the company. Embedding risk thinking in all parts of our operations, improving the quality of toolbox meetings, project risk assessment, and ensuring that the job safety analyses capture best practice, is all part of this. We believe identifying, mitigating and managing risk to our employees and anyone we encounter in our operations is essential for our long term success.One Culture – First introduced in 2013, the PGS One Culture initiative continues to strengthen our organization: establishing close cooperation between offshore personnel and onshore vessel management teams. In 2015, we expanded the focus on vessel risk and strengthened  the vessel management team. The Field Support Program. By including Party Chiefs and Captains in a one year mentoring program in HSEQ, we generate more effective knowledge transfer and improve monitoring  of operational and technical risks across the fleet.
Contractor management – Our focus on contractors and their integration in PGS operations has increased. This is an area with further scope for improvement. Dedicated HSEQ resources have been allocated to follow up our suppliers of support vessels and we are continually making efforts  on further embedding  the support vessel in our daily operations .
Looking Ahead 
In the coming year, our work on core values will center on exemplification and recognition of good examples by individuals and teams.
Technical and managerial levels in our Imaging & Engineering 
(I&E) business area will be the first to adopt the PGS Career Framework. From early 2016 we will conduct a field test in I&E that will lay the foundation for further implementation. 
Year-on-year improvements in our HSEQ performance 
statistics are certainly related to HSEQ improvement initiatives focused on risk management. In 2016 we will continue to embed risk thinking, by focusing on linking project risks to daily operational risks, identifying and managing combined risks that elevate the total risk picture. We will also further be adapting the OneCulture principles. Increased daily communication with our main contractors during operations offshore will be another of our main goals during 2016.   10
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015Environment
The oceans of the world are our work place. 
Our job consists of efficiently generating high quality seismic data, with the least amount of environmental impact and interference with the activities of other users of the oceans. ISO 14001 certification is evidence of our commitment to preventing harm to the environment. We comply with applicable legal requirements and we continuously improve our environmental performance.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015Key Activities in 2015
In 2015, we have been working to improve our energy 
efficiency with the aim of reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of seismic data acquired compared to 2014. Our Operations business area has implemented three key initiatives to achieve this:
Improve voyage and survey fuel-efficiency planning
Drag reduction on seismic equipment
Improved ship energy efficiency management plans (SEEMP)
We made tangible improvements on these long-term initiatives in 2015, and we hope to see even further improvements in our energy efficiency from 2016  and onwards.
Additionally, efforts to improve our environmental risk 
management across the company include:
A new process for managing the use of chemicals  – includes risk assessment of large scale use of  chemicals and a substitution plan for hazardous  and environmentally damaging substances.A dynamic assessment of environmental risk throughout the project life-cycle for all surveys – revised project risk management process.
A database for collating marine mammal observations and detections during PGS surveys – this will inform our risk assessments and offers an opportunity to share these data with the research community.
PGS is currently chairing the International Association of Geophysical Contractors (IAGC) environment committee. We have been working closely with peers, clients and regulatory bodies across the world to build a science-based and collaborative approach to managing the environmental impact of seismic surveys.13
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015Looking Ahead 
Last year we defined our environmental strategy for 2015 
to 2020. We have now embarked on implementing it across the company. PGS shall endeavor to be a responsible user of the oceans and ensure that we take due caution in managing our environmental impact by implementing mitigating measures that are effective (have a proven effect) and efficient (feasible to implement).
It is in our interest and our duty to promote and support 
scientific advances on the ocean environment. Sharing relevant data we collect with scientists has become an integral part of our strategy. This may include marine mammal observations and detections. We are exploring opportunities to leverage our fleet of seismic vessels as research platforms, through academic partnerships with the oceanographic research community.
If you have suggestions or ideas for similar projects and 
collaboration please contact us at environment@pgs.com.Bio-acoustic monitoring on Ramform Sovereign In 2015, the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and PGS collaborated to collect bio-acoustic data during the Ramform Sovereign’s survey in the Great Australian Bight.
Acoustic data from the vessel’s echo sounder was 
collected for the duration of the survey and sent onshore for analysis. CSIRO scientists will use the data to characterize and monitor mid-trophic organisms (plankton, fish, crustaceans, squid) in  the water column.
“This study is a perfect example of how 
PGS and the research community can collaborate to advance our knowledge of the oceans” – says Magnus Christiansen, PGS Environment ManagerCase Example:

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015Key Activities in 2015
Status on anti-corruption initiatives 
In 2015, we intensified our anti-corruption training and performed a number of face-to-face courses tailored for various groups of employees exposed to corruption risk.  We also enabled line managers to deliver this type of training by preparing them through specific ‘train the trainer’ sessions.
All anti-corruption policies and procedures were revised 
and updated during 2015. In addition, a new ‘Charity and Sponsorship’ procedure was rolled-out, and a Charity & Sponsorship Committee was appointed to assess all applications for benefits to external organizations and causes. Although we believe in supporting good causes,  we wish to avoid providing funds to unethical projects,  or recipients. To avoid this we have strengthened our internal controls through a centralized evaluation before providing funds. Read more about this on p 18.
Anti-corruption survey 2015 – results 
PGS performed a comprehensive anti-corruption survey in 2015 which included all PGS employees. The objective was to assess and increase awareness and knowledge, get a picture of the company’s “tone” about anti-corruption, assess effectiveness of training, collect input for improvement and evaluate whether any critical issues exist which needed special focus or action.
The results were largely positive and encouraging with 
regard to current initiatives.
High training satisfaction – positive perception of the company's focus and a high awareness around the topic in general
“Tone at the top” generally perceived as credible and trustworthy
In-person trained employees have best knowledge
Employees do not always realize their own exposure  – therefore awareness training is essential
Remote location governanceIn order to improve a structured and documented process for compliance monitoring of the company’s smaller  entities between on-site audits, a number of changes  were implemented. Several measures were taken relating  to clarifying the roles and responsibilities for line management  
and corporate support functions. In addition, a more comprehensive PGS policy for Governance of Legal Entity Statutory Compliance was launched and has already shown first results.Human rights implemented in the value chain PGS standard contracts now include specific contractor requirements. Suppliers and sub-suppliers shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to ethical and responsible standards of behavior, including, without limitation, those dealing with human rights (such as human trafficking and slavery), and sustainable development.
Regular updates of the supplier risk register will determine 
the requirement for audits and supplier follow-up.
Going forward, the procurement department will review 
and consider how to further implement this in the supplier pre-qualification process. 
Looking Ahead 
In 2016 we will further develop and strengthen our existing compliance training program for PGS agents. We will also continue to improve the quality of the existing internal due-diligence on our representatives.Employees Who Have Completed

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015Key Activities in 2015
Building trust with communities 
PGS aims to be a good corporate citizen wherever we operate. We understand that our presence may have have an impact, both short-term and long-term. This is why our interaction with communities is a key consideration when we plan and carry out our surveys. We often operate in areas where there is limited infrastructure and communities are not used to dealing with large businesses. Where we establish a more permanent presence, we systematically work with communities through partnerships and programs to create long-term value for them. Education is one of the areas we focus on – reaching out to schools in an attempt to promote learning. In cases where we have a shorter-term presence, we strive for open communication and collaboration with the local communities to manage the potential impact of our work. By understanding their concerns and informing them about our operations we find solutions that are acceptable to everyone. Community engagement starts at the very beginning of the project management process to ensure local voices are heard and their safety and well-being are secured. Our interaction is transparent, providing them with information every step of the way and considering their needs and concerns. 
We come into contact with various communities, big and 
small, but due to the nature of our business, we interact most commonly with fishing communities. Our process  of handing our collaboration is always the same: 
First we evaluate the potential for conflicting priorities with fishing communities
Then we check if responsibility for this relationship  is assigned to a specific part by the contract or  relevant regulations
If there is no clear responsibility for engaging with the fishing communities, we step in to ensure their needs are managed and protected
In some parts of the world regulatory framework exists to cover interaction with local communities, however, PGS always maintains a consistent approach to supporting local communities through a unified set of procedures and processes. An example of this is the development of an integrated PGS approach to charity contributions and sponsorships. Promoting positive change in local communities has been a key motivational factor behind this initiative. We believe that encouraging knowledge development through our sponsorship can drive innovation and economic development in the local communities whilst promoting trust and partnership with them. You can read more about this initiative in the next section.The Jetty at ThandweOur support vessel in Myanmar is used to transport crew to and from shore. The final stretch is shallow and a workboat is used to get alongside the jetty.  
The jetty at Thandwe is congested by local fishing vessels and was not up to PGS safety standards. Initially our shore supervisors made some minor structural changes, which proved very popular in the local community. They then arranged to build an entirely new jetty. The result significantly improves safety for all users. 
The new jetty was built by hand, by local workers, using 
boulders and concrete; construction work was limited to three to four hours a day, due to tides. PGS provided raw materials and personal protective equipment, with the support of our oil company clients. 
The new jetty at Thandwe will benefit the local 
community for many years to come, for fishing and transport, as well as any future offshore operations. Case Example:
Centralization of sponsoring and charity management Sponsorship and charity contributions by PGS have traditionally been handled locally. This has resulted  in a lack of vision, and little consistency and direction  in what we support and communicate. 
To improve our overview and increase the value of our 
contributions, we have established a Sponsor Application tool to manage sponsorships. A charity and sponsorship committee has been created, tasked with logging and evaluating all sponsor applications. The committee, which consists of members from Compliance, HSEQ, Communications and Legal approves or rejects all applications. 
Requests for sponsorship or charitable support are registered 
using a web tool that is available to all employees. We have communicated our corporate sponsorship aims, with three focus areas: 
Ocean preservation and research
Mathematics – students and education
Improving PGS visibility and relations in the  local community 
Applications for other purposes may be submitted. However, a defined strategic direction for sponsorship and charity initiatives will help us develop a clearer sponsor profile. We believe this will have a positive impact on PGS’ reputation and brand identity for our employees, and also among our other stakeholders.18
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015Interaction with Investors
PGS has an investor relations function to ensure that requests for information from shareholders, analysts, potential investors  
and other interested parties are handled in a satisfactory manner. 
PGS has an active investor communication program which 
includes senior management roadshows in connection with reporting of quarterly results, presentations and investor meetings at relevant investor conferences, and availability for one-on-one meetings at our offices, as well as conference calls. 
Each year we host a Capital Markets Day in order to give 
the capital market an in depth tutorial of PGS' different business areas and senior management perspectives of the seismic market outlook. We compile consensus numbers and publishes them on the PGS webpage and conduct frequent dialog with the sell-side analysts having research coverage of the Company.

Identification of strategic key suppliers  
Managing our supply chain is an important discipline in the operational and strategic development of PGS. Suppliers contribute significant value to PGS and to our customers.  We will only use suppliers who adhere to our standards of  ethics, anti-corruption, health, safety environment and quality. Shore Power Case StudyIn 2015, we signed a contract with SEC AS for the delivery of Shore Power Connection Systems. The project, which involved installing shore-side electrical power facilities at our vessel base in Bergen, will considerably reduce our NO
x emissions and noise 
pollution. We worked in close cooperation with the supplier SEC AS throughout the entire project cycle and were involved in every stage – from planning and development on to installation and operation. Such close working relations are important for us to ensure the suppliers understand and meet our high standards of conduct, safety and quality. 
As a result of the close collaboration, our Bergen 
facilities are now equipped with the best technology in power electronics – a solution which helps reduce environmental impact, brings economic benefits for PGS.Case Example:
All suppliers must warrant that they do not violate any anti-corruption laws in connection with their work for PGS. Suppliers of critical services or contract value above USD 1 million are required to complete a supplier qualification process (implemented in 2014) including assessment of their health and safety standards and quality system.  On a risk-based approach, suppliers are also subject to  a more extensive anti-corruption due diligence review.
In 2015 we have developed and began to implement a supplier 
relationship management procedure. This defines high-risk and strategic suppliers, with a detailed supplier follow-up strategy. It also includes monitoring key performance indicators and a method for closer collaboration. We also perform monitoring activities such as audits and verifications to manage identified risks. The roll out of this procedure will continue in 2016. 
Looking Ahead 
In 2016 we will continue to build and maintain trusted-partner relationships with suppliers, customers, and communities, as we believe that these can generate more value both short-term and long-term. As the market priorities are dynamic, we will continue to monitor change through relationships established with key customer groups and adjust our agreements with key suppliers accordingly.
We expect our contractors to deliver agreed quality and 
reliable performance. In the coming year we will continue  to monitor performance and review requirements.3 222
