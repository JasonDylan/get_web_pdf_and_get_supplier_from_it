Company Overview
102-14 - S tatement f rom S enior De cision-Maker
I am proud of the fact that ABM is the 44th larg est employer in the Fortune 500. 
With that comes great res ponsibility to our people a nd the c ommunities we serve. After 
all, ABM is a people b usiness with more than 130, 000 employees and 350 branch 
locations throughout the Unite d States and various internati onal locations.  This fact 
permeates everything we do  at ABM and uniquely link s our business commitments to 
sustainability and Corpor ate Social Responsibility  (CSR). 
In this report, you will find the sustainability milest ones we have achieved in  2017. I want 
to highlight a few items.  We were able to surpass  our lo ng-term emissions reduc tion 
goal by achieving an 18% intensity reduction (met ric to nnes CO2e per FTE). Our  goal 
was a 15% reduction of ou r 2011-year Scope 1+2 emissions by 2020. We also initiated 
our ABMCares program whic h allows for matching of chari table donations made 
by employe es. Through ABMCares and  our associated programs , we donated more 
than $1.3 million to cha rities in FY2017. Finally, in 2017, we focused on imple menting 
technology solutions and  standard operating practi ces that reduce waste. For ex ample,  
through our new online talent platform we have elimina ted more than 3 million pi eces of 
physical paper from the h iring process. 
Looking Back
Overall, FY2017 was a mome ntous year for ABM. We ope rated for the first time und er 
our new 2020 Vision industr y group organizational structure, and successfully g rew our  
business organically. We comp leted the largest transacti on in ABM’s history thr ough o ur 
acquisition of GCA Serv ices Group, a leading provide r of facilities services in 
the education and commerci al industries. And we em brace d our Pu rpose, Vision and 
Mission, which are shown on the previous page. A s our 2017  performance reflects, we 
were undeterred by the co mplexities of our 2020 Vision business transf orma tion. We 
navigated change and manag ed our business steadily  while focusing on giving back and 
driving sustainability. An Unprecedented Year 
Corporate Social Responsib ility is at the heart of ABM eve ry da y, whether we’re 
creating efficiencies for cl ients or keeping a keen eye on how our operations impa ct 
our shared environment  and support our communitie s. It is also a shared respon sibil ity. 
No single company or organ ization can meet and solve a ll the social responsibility  and 
sustainability challenges we face. 
2017 was a prime example of that as the United State s was impacted by several 
natural disasters. Hurric anes Harvey, Irma, and Mari a displaced thousands of people . 
ABM and many companies prov ided safety and suppor t for their communities. 
Organizations also provide d resources so those co mm unities could rebuild. During 
times like these, I am con founded by the power of what w e often cannot control a nd 
equally inspired by the  strength of character in people.  These natural disa sters hit 
home for many of our employ ees and has only stren gthened our resolve and focus o n 
CSR. 
Looking Ahead
The importance of social re sponsibility will only inc rease in the coming years. T he 
world’s approach to changing  demographics, climate change , inequality, energy 
diversity, privacy, da ta protection, and more will have a lasting impact on o ur society 
as we advance forward. For  our part, we are committe d to providing value for all o ur 
stakeholders: our employ ees, our clients, our inves tors, and our communiti es.

Sustainability in ABM Services 
We’ve built our strong reputation in part by continually striving to improve 
upon our client service offerings through the ABM GreenCare® program.  As 
part of the program, we actively work with our clients on a wide range of these 
efforts, from energy reduction to green cleaning and Leadership in Energy & 
Environmental Design (LEED) certification. 
ABM GreenCare® 
ABM GreenCare®   helps clients make improvements in four key areas:  
environmental and social responsibility, employee productivity and retention, 
property protection, and fiscal responsibility.  This program’s offerings span 
our businesses and the key industries we serve.  As a member of the U.S. Green 
Building Council (USGBC), we also continue to offer specific products and 
procedures for buildings to maintain certification through the LEED Rating system.
ABM’s commitment to measuring its own performance has led to some statistics 
relating to its clients’ sustainability efforts, including:
• ABM GreenCare has been implemented at over 1,000 buildings, totaling more 
than 460 million square feet across the United States.  
• ABM’s Energy Solutions program reduced clients’ energy use by over 23 
percent on average.
• ABM has installed over 8,000 EV charging ports across the United States with 
many more expected in 2018.
• ABM has assisted more than 480 million square feet worth of client buildings 
with products and procedures to maintain certification through the LEED rating 
system. We service over 469 USGBC LEED-certified and registered sitesSum of Gross Square Footage (in millions)
LEED® Certified 236,901,000
Initial Phase 171,913,000
LEED® Registered 77,715,000
Grand Total 486,529,000
Number of LEED® Certified Buildings T otal 469
Total in Program 1,093
Some of the key value-adds that ABM GreenCare® offers to clients include:
• Green cleaning programs with Green Seal certified or environmentally 
preferable products and certified equipment improve indoor environmental 
quality for building occupants. We also provide recycling, touch-free water 
conservation, and LEED certification assistance for clients. 
• Just as with our entire line of services, ABM is utilizing technology to upgrade 
our sustainable offerings.  This includes electrically activated water systems 
that produce general cleaning and sanitizing solutions from water, salt 
and electricity.  These allow ABM to produce safe, non-toxic daily cleaning 
solutions onsite and reduce packaging, transportation, and storage issues 
associated with traditional chemicals.    
• ABM continues to identify new products and methods to operate more 
efficiently for our clients and stay on the forefront of sustainable practices 
and new innovations in cleaning methods and equipment. Through our strong, 
established relationships with industry-leading supply, chemical, and raw 
material manufacturers we are actively implementing new solutions. 
Energy
ABM understands that clients face tremendous financial pressures as a result of 
increasing demand. Our expertise in energy savings performance contracts and 
Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing provides us with the unique 
ability to collaboratively work with clients to help them address facility upgrade 
needs, sustainability goals, and financing options. Through the implementation ABM Corporate Sustainability Report 2017   |  July 2018  |  7
of the ABM program, clients benefit from improved facilities that are paid 
for through their existing budget and from the savings incurred by the 
improvements. In addition to traditional facility upgrades that help clients lower 
costs — HV AC, mechanical, electrical and lighting — we also offer a number of 
other energy conservation measures, including EV charging and solar solutions.
Energy Performance Contracting Program
As an accredited member of the National Association of Energy Companies, 
ABM achieves cost reductions and sustainability goals for our partners by using 
future savings to enable projects. Our energy performance contracting program 
has helped public and private sector clients save an average of 23% on their 
energy costs and millions of dollars over the course of their contracts.
EV Charging
As one of the leading installers of EV charging stations, ABM has installed more 
than 8,000+ EV charging ports. ABM’s partnership with multiple market leaders 
of EV hardware and network providers brings us the first all-inclusive, affordable 
charging service plan. There’s no need to choose either DC or Level 2 Fast Charging 
Stations, which creates a value-added amenity for all of a clients’ customers.
Solar
We help clients understand that solar has become a viable financial solution for 
companies. ABM enables facilities to receive the financial and environmental 
benefits of adopting a solar power solution and assists with the design, 
installation, financing and management of these systems.
Parking
For parking facilities, ABM provides LEED certification support, such as EV 
charging ports, solar panel installation, green cleaning, and energy-efficient 
lighting. Our customized mobile app helps drivers save time, money, and gas 
through online payments, a parking locator, a frequent parker program, and 
online reservations. We were one of the founding members of ParkSmart and 
service two ParkSmart Green Certified garages, in addition to our sustainable 
practices at other locations. ABM parking also provides the incentive of discounted parking for people 
who share rides or participate in van pools. One of our clients’ rideshare 
program consists of 34 leased vehicles and has more than 3,000 participants. 
We install bicycle parking and offer shuttle services to assist our clients’ customers 
to safely and sustainably move from parking lots to facilities, or from public transit 
centers to client facilities. For riders’ convenience, we sell public transit passes 
(bus or train), and we help clients by doing SCAQMD emissions reporting.  More 
than half of our shuttles use natural gas or propane, running 11 million miles a year. 
We wash our vehicles according to local environmental regulations. 
Landscape & Grounds
ABM uses alternative fuel and water-efficient, “smart” irrigation systems 
with timers and flow sensors to help keep clients’ properties sustainable. Our 
services include draught tolerant plantings, integrated pest management, and 
LEED certification support. 
Air Travel
ABM’s GreenCare Program is an integral part of our services at several airport 
locations. We are committed to reducing our clients’ impact on the environment 
by providing a full range of services, from environmentally friendly janitorial and 
maintenance to energy efficiency improvements. In 2017 ABM helped JFK T erminal 
4 take steps toward LEED Gold certification (which it obtained in early 2018).

102-9 - Supply Chain
ABM uses strategic supplier partnerships, providing a capable, modern supply 
chain allowing ABM employees to order and receive the products used to 
service our clients in the most efficient manner.  Having strategic suppliers 
implementing modern supply chain practices allows ABM to asses and minimize

between work sites.   ABM Corporate Sustainability Report 2017   |  July 2018  |  10
ABM’s suppliers fall into several 
categories.  These include suppliers

supplies, information technology, 
communications, utilities, 
etc.), suppliers for products 
used in our services (cleaning 
chemicals, cleaning equipment, 
paper and plastic liner products, 
engineering HV AC, alternative 
energy components, fleet vehicles, 
landscape materials),  service providers (pest control, landscaping, engineering, 
waste removal) and suppliers for external marketing and communications 
(consultants, printing, materials). 
102-10 - Significant Changes to the Organization and Its Supply Chain
Organizational Realignment
In 2017, we operated for the first time under our new 2020 Vision industry group 
organizational structure, and successfully grew our business organically. We also 
completed the largest transaction in ABM’s history through our acquisition of 
GCA Services Group, a leading provider of facilities services in the education and 
commercial industries, while also divesting our non-core Government Services 
business. 
In Phase 2, which started in 2017 and is continuing, we are focused on 
improvements to our operational framework to promote efficiencies and 
process enhancements.
Best Practices
In 2017, we conducted a thorough evaluation of our field operations across 
the country to identify best practices (the “ ABMWay”) in account planning, 
labor management, manager development, and safety and risk management. 
As a result of this site-by-site review, we began to codify best practices, and throughout our company we are piloting ABM Way procedures, including 
initiating team cleaning and instituting a daily moment of safety. We also 
continue to make investments in technology platforms to help drive and 
sustain our 2020 Vision strategy. 
Cost Optimization
We are migrating more of our back-office functions to our Enterprise Services 
Center in Sugar Land, T exas and are continuing to consolidate our procurement 
activities. Our procurement initiatives resulted in savings of $10.0 million during 
2017. See also our Supply Chain discussion in the previous section of this report. 
Talent Development
One of the key underpinnings of our 2020 Vision is the investment in people and 
the development of key personnel. Our T alent Development Group improved 
front-line leadership training initiatives, began the centralization of talent 
acquisition for staff and management, and completed a full talent assessment 
program identifying emerging leaders throughout the company. By prioritizing 
these initiatives, we believe we are building a stronger organization that will 
enable us to be a leader in industry-based facility solutions.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
On May 31, 2017, we sold our Government Services business.  
Effective December 1, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of 
Mechanical Solutions, Inc. (“MSI”), a mechanical service operator that 
specializes in HV AC, plumbing, building automation and mechanical retrofits.  
This acquisition bolsters our T echnical Solutions and coverage in the Dallas/
Fort Worth metro market with chiller expertise, expanded service and retrofit 
capability, controls for building automation, and commercial plumbing service. 
Also, effective December 1, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of 
OFJ Connections Ltd (“OFJ”), which provides ground transportation at Gatwick 
Airport for both the airport and all airlines, as well as similar services at London 
City Airport. The addition of OFJ helps solidify Omniserv’s strength in the U.K.  
ABM Corporate Sustainability Report 2017   |  July 2018  |  11
We completed the acquisition of GCA Services Group on September 1, 2017. 
GCA Services is a provider of integrated facility services to educational 
institutions and commercial facilities. We expect this acquisition to be 
transformative and to accelerate our 2020 Vision as GCA ’s client-centric 
goals and philosophies align closely with those of ABM. We also believe this 
acquisition will strengthen all of our industry groups and, in particular, position 
our Education industry group as a leader in this market segment.
102-11 - Precautionary Principle or Approach
Enterprise risks are reviewed by ABM’s Enterprise Risk Management Committee 
on a periodic basis. This committee includes Industry Group and Functional 
leadership.  The Enterprise Risk Management Committee identifies key 
enterprise risks. The company’s Board of Directors receives regular reports from 
the Enterprise Risk Management Committee. ABM continues to move forward 
with the integration of sustainability into our business strategy following the 
four key principles:
• Responsibility in the workplace relates to a broad range of items including 
labor standards, talent management, diversity and inclusion, discrimination 
and harassment, employee training and safety, and employee health;
• Responsibility in the marketplace revolves around client safety, service 
quality, responsible sourcing and supply chain management, and proper and 
responsible marketing practices;
• Responsibility in the environment is centered on our energy and resource 
efficiency, reducing or eliminating drains on the environments we share and 
reusing or repurposing products we use and distribute to maximize their 
lifecycle; and
• Responsibility in the community is the culmination of the first three principles 
as well as our focus on philanthropy and community involvement through our 
ABMCares program. All of the above feed directly into how we affect the public at large within our 
circle of influence.
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and/or local laws regulating 
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the 
protection of the environment, such as discharge into soil, water, and air, and 
the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and 
hazardous substances. These laws can have the effect of increasing costs and 
potential liabilities associated with the conduct of our operations.
In addition, from time to time, we are involved in environmental matters at 
certain of our locations or in connection with our operations. Historically, the 
cost of complying with environmental laws or resolving environmental issues 
relating to United States locations or operations has not had a material adverse 
effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
ABM holds its suppliers and contractors to a high standard. ABM is committed to 
complying with all laws prohibiting child labor, including adherence to minimum 
age provisions of applicable laws and regulations. This includes ABM’s internal 
workforce and our suppliers. ABM also expects its subcontractors to commit 
to proper treatment of their workers, specifically including human rights and 
freedom of association.

ABM key stakeholders are identified as audiences who have some interest or 
impact on the business both through direct and indirect means. The stakeholders 
selected for this report included ABM executives, ABM employees, clients, and 
vendor partners.
102-43 - Approach to Stakeholder Engagement
ABM’s services are generally provided at our clients’ locations and are often 
an integral part of our clients’ sustainability integration (e.g., cleaning, facility 
maintenance, energy conservation, safety, etc.).  Therefore, our approach to 
sustainability begins within ABM’s service offerings and solutions.  
Our next known need was identified as ABM’s portion within our clients’ supply 
chain.  While not a carbon intensive company, the decision to identify and track 
our emission levels using Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol toolsets and thinking 
of our company’s role, risks and potential gains in relation to climate change 
brought sustainability integration out of merely a service element and into a 
business component. 
Our employees continue to be the driving force behind everything we do at 
ABM, and we seek to deliver value for our shareholders each day.  Finally, ABM 
feels a keen sense of responsibility to operate responsibly both for and within 
the communities in which we operate and serve. ABM reaches out to our key

Corporate Sustainability Reporting
Our approach to sustainability is based upon addressing known and perceived 
stakeholder needs.  With ABM’s primary stakeholders being clients, employees, 
vendor partners, shareholders and the communities in which we serve, people 
drive our strategy, and understanding the varied and sometimes intertwined needs 
of these groups is paramount to the success of ABM’s sustainability program.  
Readers can send feedback, comments or questions regarding our 
sustainability plans and progress to ABM’s Corporate Communications team at

assessment following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework. The 
materiality assessment covers GRI indicators in Economic, Environmental 
and Social categories which stakeholders rate for ABM activities and its 
impact.  An index of the GRI indicators and metrics is provided here, linking 
the applicable topics with the corresponding page(s). For the seventh year in 
a row, we submitted our report to the Centre for Sustainability and Excellence

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and/or local laws regulating 
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection 
of the environment, such as discharge into soil, water, and air, and the generation, 
handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous substances.  
These laws generally have the effect of increasing costs and potential liabilities 
associated with the conduct of our operations.  In addition, from time to time, we 
are involved in environmental matters at certain of our locations or in connection 
with our operations.  Historicall y, the cost of complying with environmental 
laws or resolving environmental issues relating to United States locations or 
operations has not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, results 
of operations, or cash fl ows.ABM Corporate Sustainability Report 2017    |  July 2018  |  19

Data of natural gas use in leased offices was gathered through our annual survey. 
Office locations in which the utilities are included in common area maintenance 
(CAM) were estimated based upon similarity to other known offices of that size 
and region of the country. Fleet data of gallons of fuel used by vehicle, by model 
year were analyzed. Fuel purchases not directly assigned to a specific vehicle 
were calculated as a Light-Duty Vehicle (small truck/van) as that is our primary 
vehicle type within the ABM fleet.Actual data was gathered through our online survey when available. For 
offices that did not have readily available data or the electricity is included 
within CAM charges, estimations were made based upon similar sized offices 
of the same region or previous year data (if available).

405-2 - Ratio of Basic Salary and Remuneration of Women to Men
ABM is an Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer 
operating in compliance with Executive Order 11246, as amended, Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act, as amended, and The Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended. Our 
Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, which states ABM’s zero tolerance policy 
toward discrimination, is signed and supported by Chief Executive Officer Scott 
Salmirs and applies to “all employment practices, including recruitment, hiring, 
promotion, layoff or termination, compensation  and training programs. ”  We 
are committed to providing a workplace free of discrimination based on race, 
gender, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, and status as 
a protected veteran, among other characteristics.
ABM is fully committed to equality. However, circumstances prevent us from 
providing our report at this time. Specifically, ABM has just completed Phase 
I of a multi-phase reorganization that, given the size of our organization, is 
anticipated to take several years to complete. (We have approximately 135,000 
employees and operations in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of 
Columbia, as well as in England and the Middle East.) Under our current structure, 
we have more than 20 “employee categories” and at least 460 “significant 
locations of operation. ” Much of this is in flux due to the reorganization. 406-1 - Incidents of Discriminiation and Corrective Actions Taken
Professional behavior is expected and required of all ABM employees. The 
company’s intent is to provide all employees with a workplace environment 
consistent with ABM’s core values of Respect, Integrity, Collaboration, 
Innovation and Excellence. Accordingly, ABM does not tolerate workplace 
discrimination or harassment based on age, ancestry, color, religious creed, 
request for / use of family and medical care leave, disability (mental or physical) 
including HIV and AIDS, marital status, medical, genetic information, military 
and veteran status, national origin, race, sex, gender, gender identity, gender 
expression, sexual orientation, or any other status protected by law.  T o 
ensure that all employees have a confidential channel for reporting incidents 
of misconduct and unlawful business practices, ABM provides a Compliance 
Hotline (“Hotline”), a reporting system that allows employees to report a 
variety of concerns, including but not limited to: harassment, discrimination, 
retaliation, wage and hour issues (such as not being paid properly for all 
hours worked, not being paid properly for overtime, paycheck problems, etc.), 
accounting irregularities, corporate abuse and fraud, theft, safety concerns, 
workers’ compensation fraud, or other suspected violations of law or company 
policy, that they observe or encounter in the workplace. The Hotline is staffed 
by professional, trained specialists 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Reports 
may be made in any language and callers may remain anonymous if they wish. 
All completed reports to the Hotline will be assigned to an investigator. ABM 
conducts a prompt, objective, thorough and confidential investigation of the 
reported concern.  The investigation process will reach reasonable conclusions 
based on the evidence collected. If ABM determines that conduct violating its 
policies has occurred, it will take prompt and appropriate remedial action which 
can include termination of the individual who engaged in inappropriate conduct 
and/or other measures designed to prevent future discrimination or harassment.  
In order to encourage employees to utilize the Hotline and report concerns, 
ABM does not publicly disclose information about complaints, the status of the 
investigations related thereto, or the specific remedial measures taken.  ABM Corporate Sustainability Report 2017    |  July 2018  |  29
413-1 -   Operations with Local Community Engagement, Impact Assessments 
and Devleopment Programs
Foremost,  all ABM HR recruiting for site level employees starts in the local 
communities in which that site is located.  We want our people who work at client 
locations to be members of that community, if at all possible.
ABM in the Community 
ABM is committed to operating under a core set of fundamental values:
• Respect
• Integrity
• Collaboration
• Innovation
• Trust
• Excellence
These values intertwine to provide a baseline mentality for how we operate, and 
nowhere is that more evident than in how we take responsibility for our activities 
which impact stakeholders and the environment.
This year, more than 25,000 ABM employees were impacted by the devastating 
impact of natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes and wild 
fires. During these times, our employees banded together to care for their 
communities, clients, and each other, even as they faced their own personal 
losses. This illustrated the strength and character of our organization and our 
ability to drive results through resilience.
How We Give Back 
We’ve launched our ABMCares program to ensure that every staff and 
management employee can take a day to do community work, if they choose. 
We have also formalized a charitable donation matching policy to help our management and staff employees continue to give back to the communities 
in which they work, play, and live. An ABMCares web portal makes it simple 
for our employees to find charities, donate their time and resources, and 
electronically enable donations with company matching. 
 In 2017, employees in each of our industry groups and supporting business 
functions engaged in philanthropic projects in their own communities throughout 
the enterprise. Click here  to read more about ABM’s commitment to our local 
communities. 
We also celebrate these activities on our Facebook page  and other social 
media sites. 
Individuals, ABM service teams, and clients have received international and 
local recognition for their contributions to sustainability, service excellence, and 
community.
