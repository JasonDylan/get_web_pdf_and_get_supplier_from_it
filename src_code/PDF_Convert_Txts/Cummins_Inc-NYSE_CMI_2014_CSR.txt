  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2014-2015THE POWER 
OF CUMMINS
ABOUT THE COVER
One of the most visible signs of the 
“Power of Cummins” is the Company’s 
QSK95, the largest high-speed diesel engine Cummins has ever built.  
The engine was chosen by Siemens  
to power its Charger locomotive in  the United States. Siemens won a 
multi-state, $225 million contract to 
build 35 diesel-electric locomotives.
Cummins employees are shown 
pushing the QSK95 into a test cell at 
the Company’s Seymour Engine Plant in Seymour, Indiana (U.S.A.). You can 
learn more about the Company’s big 
year in passenger rail on page 18.
The QSK95, by the way, is also 
powering a new line of generators.  
You can learn more about that  on page 40.THE POWER

INTRODUCTION
A NOTE FROM  
THE CHAIRMAN
I sometimes surprise people when I tell them  
Cummins is a high-tech company, rivaling anything  
they might find in Silicon Valley.
The outside of our engines look much 
as they did when our founder Clessie 
Cummins first experimented with 
diesels more than 95 years ago.  But the cutting-edge technology on  
the inside enables our customers to 
get the power they need with near  zero emissions to do business in  
some of the most competitive, 
demanding applications in the world.
Our fuel injectors, for example, must 
be in a near perfect cylindrical form 
to precisely apply fuel at more than 30,000 pounds per square inch (psi) 
to enhance combustion while reducing 
emissions. They can’t do their job if there is an error as small as the 
diameter of a single strand of hair.
 Cummins’ turbochargers, spinning at 
120,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), 
boost engine power while providing  
the heat necessary for chemical reactions in our aftertreatment 
systems. The aftertreatment converts 
oxides of nitrogen, a key contributor to smog, into nitrogen and water that can 
be safely emitted into the atmosphere. 
These advances have helped reduce 
diesel engine emissions in North 
America by nearly 100 percent over 
the past 20 years. You can put a handkerchief over the exhaust pipe of 
a diesel engine today with the proper 
aftertreatment and it will remain white even after the driver revs the engine. 
Our technology has to work in extreme 
heat and cold, at high altitudes and deep underground. And it must be 
reliable. Cummins’ on-highway truck 
engines regularly travel a million  miles if properly maintained – almost  
10 times what most people expect 
from their cars. Cummins’ generators can power hospitals, data centers  
and other critical buildings for tens  
of thousands of hours.
Like many Silicon Valley companies, 
Cummins has engineers developing 
smart and predictive technology for onboard diagnostics. They also help 
ensure our fuel systems and other 
components work well together. 
But we also have chemists exploring 
reactions to remove pollutants 
from emissions. And our experts in computational fluid dynamics and 
thermal management use advanced 
computer modeling to simulate the harsh environment inside an engine. 
They can test an almost limitless number of variables before an engine  is ever placed in a test cell. 
Cummins is probably best known for 
diesel engines, but we also design and 
build engines that run on natural gas, 
biofuels and diesel-electric hybrids.  We are experimenting with everything 
from 3-D printing to electrification and 
start-stop technology (page 70).
Our mission demands that 
“everything we do leads to a cleaner, 
healthier, safer environment” and 
in 2014 Cummins adopted its first 
comprehensive environmental 
sustainability plan. This plan introduced goals to further reduce our use of 
water, energy and our greenhouse gas 
emissions while increasing recycling at the Company. We made significant 
progress on these goals (page 27) and 
have established new goals starting in 2015 for our products in use and 
internal logistics (page 24).

INTERNSHIP – ASSISTANT TO PLANT MANAGER  
Columbus MidRange Engine Plant, 1992For all of these reasons, technical 
innovation is critical to Cummins  
when it comes to sustainability.  
That’s as true for a very large engine like the QSK95 powering a locomotive  
(page 18), as it is for the Company’s new 5.0L V8 Turbo Diesel for pickup trucks (page 68). 
We operate in a unique business 
environment. A significant portion  of Cummins’ customers build their  
own engines. When they buy ours,  
it is usually because the innovation  and quality we provide gives them  
a competitive advantage.
The Company invested a record  
$754 million in research and 
development in 2014, up more than 
7 percent from the year before, and launched more than one new or 
improved product each week to  
ensure we continue to provide a competitive advantage for our 
customers wherever they operate.Cummins’ global reach positions 
us to take advantage of an exciting 
opportunity that exists in our industry 
today. A growing number of countries are adopting more stringent emissions 
regulations to protect their natural 
resources. We believe Cummins’ technical expertise, and a proven 
record for providing the right solution  
at the right time and place, will help  us continue to expand globally.
Clessie might not recognize all of the 
high-tech features added to Cummins engines today, but I think he’d be 
pleased to see that innovation and 
quality continue to be integral to everything we do.

OUR KEY TOOLS
Cummins is a company with operations across the globe.  
To help ensure the Company operates smoothly, Cummins relies on three primary tools:
 SIX SIGMA
Cummins is a major proponent 
of Six Sigma, using the business 
improvement tool to save the 
Company and its customers  billions of dollars.
Since it was initiated at Cummins 
in 2000, Six Sigma has provided a common process and language for 
employees to solve problems and 
develop new products and processes. 
Six Sigma uses data-based analysis to 
identify defects and variation in a wide 
range of manufacturing and business situations. Here’s a quick look at what  
Six Sigma has meant to Cummins:
 »As of the end of 2014,  
approximately 21,000 people  
had been trained how to use  
Six Sigma tools at the Company since the process was introduced. 
  »An estimated $5.78 billion in savings 
have been identified at the Company 
since Six Sigma started at Cummins 
15 years ago. 
 »Cummins customers have saved  
an estimated $1.15 billion through 
Six Sigma since it was first offered  to them in 2005.
Cummins also uses Six Sigma in  its community involvement work, helping its community partners  
improve their efficiency and address 
major problems. In 2014, Cummins employees completed 156 Community 
Impact Six Sigma projects. 
 
 
 
  
 
  CUMMINS OPERATING SYSTEM
The Cummins Operating System helps develop common practices 
and approaches to improve customer

The Cummins Business Model is a 
simplified view of how the Company  
is organized that starts and ends  
with customers and the business. 
The business model was updated  
in 2013 to more accurately reflect  
how Cummins delivers products  and services to our customers  
around the world through an  
integrated supply chain. The new model more clearly represents how  
we work together to meet or exceed 
customer expectations. SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // INTRODUCTION16Cummins has a rich history, replete with examples  
of innovation, entrepreneurship and vision. 
Here’s a look at some highlights over the last 95 years:
OUR HISTORYJ. Irwin Miller, great-nephew  
of W.G. Irwin, becomes  general manager of  Cummins at the age of 24.Clessie Cummins leaves Cummins and moves to California where he continues inventing until his death in 1968.Cummins earns  its first profit.
Clessie Cummins creates the Cummins Engine Company  based in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.). William G. Irwin,  who employed Cummins as  a driver, supplies nearly all of the $50,000 in startup capital.
Cummins barnstorms across the  country, demonstrating the power  and fuel efficiency of the diesel engine in his Coast to Coast Cummins Diesel Test Bus.
Miller is commissioned as a lieutenant in the Navy Air Corps, where he served aboard the carrier Langley during World War II. He saw action in the Marshall Islands and New Guinea.Miller becomes Chairman  of the Cummins Board.Miller becomes Executive  Vice President of Cummins.
Cummins takes Irwin for a ride in a used Packard limousine that he equipped with a diesel engine on Christmas Day, convincing Irwin of the engine’s potential. Irwin invests a much-needed infusion of cash.1937

Miller helps Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with some of the organizing behind the 1963 March on Washington.  Miller was acting as leader of the National Council of Churches.Cummins establishes  
its Mission and Values  
around its Vision of 
“Making people’s  
lives better by  
unleashing the  
Power of Cummins.”Cummins enters  China as part of a deal involving  heavy construction equipment  with Cummins engines.Cummins begins operations  in India, first as a joint venture  with one plant in Pune. Today,  the Company owns all or part of  20 manufacturing facilities in the country  and employs nearly 14,000 people.
Cummins names Rich Freeland 
President and Chief Operating 
Officer in July 2014. Freeland had 
been the Engine Business Unit 
President since 2010.
President and Chief Operating Officer Tom Linebarger succeeds Tim Solso as Chairman and  CEO on Jan. 1, 2012. During Solso’s 10 years leading  Cummins the Company experienced record growth.
Cummins purchases 86 percent of the Onan Corporation in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota (U.S.A.),  which would become the basis  for its Power Generation Business.
Miller lays out his thinking on Corporate Responsibility 
in Cummins’ 1972 Annual Report. “While some still 
argue that business has no social responsibility, 
we believe that our survival in the very long run is 
as dependent upon responsible citizenship in our 
communities and in the society as it is on responsible 
technological, financial and production performance.”20121962

CUMMINS HELPS 
PASSENGER RAIL PICK UP SPEED IN NORTH AMERICA
From its Ontario-inspired shades of green to 
its custom seats, handy power outlets and 
Wi-Fi, the UP Express will have plenty to 
keep passengers talking about as it whisks visitors from Toronto’s Pearson International 
Airport to Union Station downtown for the 
Pan American Games in 2015.
Few people, however, will likely notice over the 25-minute 
trip what’s beneath Nippon Sharyo’s state-of-the art railcars. 
Cummins’ underfloor QSK19-R diesel engine will power the 
new service, but Company leaders say they’ll understand if riders focus instead on the new train’s passenger amenities 
and eye-catching exterior.
Toronto’s new rail service, when fully implemented,  
is expected to remove more than one million cars annually in and around Canada’s largest city. (Photo courtesy of METROLINX.)
COVER STORYCOVER STORY19
The Cummins QSK19-R powers more  
than 1,700 railcars currently in use in  
intercity operations in Germany, the United 
Kingdom, Australia, China and elsewhere.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINS
“At Cummins, we are all about 
partnering in our customers’ success,” 
said Melina Kennedy, the Company’s 
General Manager – Global Rail and Defense Business. “We’re very pleased 
that our ultra-clean diesel technology 
is seen as a way to help move people more efficiently while significantly 
reducing emissions and improving  
the environment.”
Powering the 18 railcars included in 
Toronto’s UP Express is merely one 
example of how Cummins is playing  an increasingly important role today  
in passenger rail in North America. 
Other projects in the works include:
 »Cummins’ QSK19-R will power  
14 Nippon Sharyo railcars headed 
to the Sonoma Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) system north of San 
Francisco, California (U.S.A.), as part 
of a more than $200 million project to expand rail service between Santa 
Rosa and San Rafael, California.
 »Cummins’ QSK95 engine, the 
largest high-speed diesel engine 
the Company has ever built, is the preferred engine for Siemens’  
new Charger locomotive.  
Siemens won a multi-state,  
$225 million contract in 2014 to build 35 diesel-electric locomotives 
now in development for intercity 
projects in the United States. 
 »Siemens’ Charger locomotive  
with the QSK95 will also power  
All Aboard Florida, the first privately owned, operated and maintained 
passenger-rail system in the United 
States. The service, which will eventually connect Miami and 
Orlando, Florida (U.S.A.), is  
expected to begin operations  in late 2016 from Miami to Fort 
Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.
Cummins is following a familiar  
path in each of these endeavors.  
The Company is combining more 
than 90 years of diesel engine know-how with a rich tradition of innovation 
and a deep technical knowledge of 
the fuel systems, aftertreatment and other components critical to meeting 
demanding emissions regulations in 
North America.When these passenger rail initiatives 
started looking for a fuel-efficient 
engine meeting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) stringent 
Tier 4 Final regulations that went into 
effect Jan. 1, 2015, Cummins had  the right product at the right time to 
deliver the power and torque they 
needed to succeed. 
“With over 100 Tier 4 locomotive, 
switcher, and railcar installations already on order, this means that 
Cummins will power almost every  
Tier 4 passenger rail project underway in North America and we have 
hundreds of additional installation 
options under consideration,” said Randy Nelson, Manager – Cummins 
Rail Business Development. BUILDING ON PROVEN SUCCESS
For the QSK19-R, Cummins is  
building on a platform with a long history of success. 
The engine powers more than  
1,700 railcars currently in use in intercity operations in Germany,  
the United Kingdom, Australia,  
China and elsewhere. The cars are 
self-propelled, with the engine typically 
installed under the car. They usually  run in pairs with the ability to add  
non-powered cars in between to 
increase passenger capacity.
The QSK19-R was the first railcar 
engine produced in North America 
certified to meet EPA’s Tier 4 Final emissions standards, the toughest  The QSK19-RSUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // COVER STORY20
in the world. The underfloor QSK19-R 
is the latest generation of the 19-liter, 
6-cylinder engine manufactured at  
the Cummins Seymour Engine Plant  in Seymour, Indiana (U.S.A.).
To meet Tier 4 Final regulations,  
and the equivalent Stage IIIB  standards for railcars in Europe, 
the engine is fully integrated with 
Cummins’ Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) aftertreatment  
system that reduces exhaust  
emissions to extremely low levels. 
SCR-based systems convert oxides 
of nitrogen (NOx), which can cause 
smog, into nitrogen and water that  can be safely emitted into the 
atmosphere. With the use of SCR 
aftertreatment, engine combustion  can be optimized to improve fuel 
efficiency. Engines with Cummins’  
SCR package have delivered up  to 6 percent better fuel economy.
The QSK19-R also has very fast  
torque response. This allows railcars  to achieve rapid acceleration from  
idle – an important advantage in 
reducing trip times on routes with  short distances between stations.Smart electronic engine controls and advanced combustion techniques 
result in a smooth delivery of power, 
providing a comfortable travel experience for passengers even when 
a railcar is running at its top speed of 
90 mph (145 km/h). The engine runs quietly with minimal vibration due to 
an upgraded common-rail fuel system 
that can precisely balance fueling across the engine’s six cylinders. 
When the service is fully implemented 
in Toronto, the UP Express is expected to remove the equivalent of more than  
a million vehicles annually in and 
around Canada’s largest city.
The 18 railcars that are part of the 
service will have a flexible seating 
capacity of 173 for a three-car configuration. Additional space for 
standing passengers is also available 
during busy periods. Air conditioning  is generated from the QSK19-R  
by means of a high-efficiency drive 
shaft, eliminating the need for an additional engine.
A very similar configuration will also 
power the railcars for the Sonoma   Ed Pence, Vice President and General Manager – Cummins High-Horsepower Engine 
Business, speaks at the ground breaking for the technical center offices at Seymour, Indiana (U.S.A.) in June 2014.
RENOVATION AND EXPANSION AIMS TO SAVE ENERGY
Cummins doesn’t want to just build clean, efficient engines.  
It wants to build those engines in ways that are clean and efficient.
The Company is finishing up a more than $250 million renovation 
and expansion of its Seymour Engine Plant in Indiana (U.S.A.) where 
both the QSK95 and QSK19-R engines are produced. The work was 
announced in 2012 and is expected to wrap up in 2015. 
In addition to energy efficient lighting and other features in the 
renovation, the work includes two state-of-the-art test cells where  
the power generated by the QSK95 engines being tested can  be captured using what’s called regenerative dynamometers to  
either help power the facility or be sold to the local power utility.  
The dynamometers are among the largest in the world.
Even before the engines make their way to the test cells, design 
changes can be tested using the latest computer technology in  
a new technical center that will adjoin the plant. That can reduce  the time engines have to run in test cells.
It’s all part of the Company’s mission that “everything we do leads  
to a cleaner, healthier, safer environment.”

Marin Area Rapid Transit system. 
SMART wants to build a line serving 
Sonoma and Marin counties, north 
of San Francisco. Eventually leaders want to link the project to Larkspur, 
California, with ferry connections 
between Larkspur and San Francisco. The project also includes an extensive 
bicycle and pedestrian path.
The initial operating segment between 
Santa Rosa and San Rafael is slated  
to open in late 2016.
 INNOVATION IN A BIG WAY
While relatively new, the QSK95 has 
been quickly making a name for itself. 
Introduced in November of 2011, the engine is eight feet tall, 14 feet long 
and capable of producing up to  
4,400 horsepower (2,983 kW) –  the largest high speed diesel  
Cummins has ever built.
Dubbed the “Hedgehog,” the engine 
was developed after Company 
leaders saw potential markets for 
a bigger engine in the Company’s

portfolio for rail, marine, mining and 
other industries. The QSK95 is also 
powering the largest generator ever 
built by Cummins Power Generation, which was introduced in the final 
quarter of 2014 (page 40).
Working from a “clean sheet,” with 
lots of flexibility to innovate, engineers 
designed the QSK95 not only to meet 
EPA Tier 4 emissions regulations, but with remanufacturing in mind to ensure a long life. Advanced electronics enable custom calibration for specific 
duty cycles. The engine also features 
SCR technology and includes all of the fuel economy benefits associated with 
Selective Catalytic Reduction.
The engine is ideal for passenger rail, 
providing clean power in a relatively 
small footprint compared with heavy, 
medium-speed diesels traditionally used in locomotive applications.It was the perfect fit when Siemens, known for its precision engineering, 
decided to enter the passenger rail 
industry in North America. Siemens chose the QSK95 when it needed an 
American-made engine to complete a 
new locomotive it planned to build at its solar-powered rail manufacturing 
hub in Sacramento, California (U.S.A.). 
Siemens’ new diesel-electric Charger 
locomotive is technically based on the 
company’s Eurosprinter, Eurorunner 
and Vectron locomotive platforms,  and will be capable of reaching  
speeds up to 125 miles per hour. 
When officials from Illinois, California 
and Washington (state) jointly bid 
a contract for 35 diesel-electric 
locomotives with an option for  another 222 locomotives for regional 
and mainline trains, Siemens was  
the winner. The trains will also serve parts of Missouri and Michigan.  
The 35 locomotives are scheduled  
to be delivered starting in 2016.WHY PASSENGER  TRAINS ARE GOOD  
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
Passenger trains are generally 
considered more efficient than  
cars because of their relatively  
high occupancy. A car may  have only a single occupant. 
According to U.S. Bureau  
of Transportation Statistics, a  passenger train in 2012, the most 
recent numbers available, used 
about 1,561 Btu’s per passenger mile compared with around  
3,861 Btu’s per passenger  
mile for cars.
When a new passenger rail service 
begins, supporters expect a certain 
number of drivers will give up  their cars and switch to the train, 
resulting in an environmental benefit.
The QSK95 engine, which will be used in 
Siemens’ Charger locomotive, is prepared  for testing at Cummins’ engine plant in  Seymour, Indiana (U.S.A.).SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // COVER STORY23
The $225 million, multi-state contract 
isn’t the only big development in 
Siemens’ rail efforts in the United 
States. The company’s Charger locomotive with the QSK95 will also 
power a ground-breaking initiative 
called All Aboard Florida.
The privately owned, operated and 
maintained passenger rail service will 
eventually connect Miami and Orlando, making intermediate stops in Fort 
Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. 
Service from Miami to West Palm Beach is scheduled to begin in late 
2016 and from West Palm Beach  
to Orlando in 2017.
The initial five trainset purchase to 
serve the Miami to Fort Lauderdale  
and West Palm Beach segment will consist of two diesel-electric 
locomotives, one on each end  
of four passenger coaches.
All Aboard Florida’s leaders expect, 
when fully implemented, the passenger 
rail service will remove 3 million cars from the road annually.LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
Even with all of these developments 
taking place, passenger rail will still  
be relatively limited in North America – especially when compared with Europe 
and other parts of the world. Skeptics 
question whether North Americans will ever be willing to give up their cars in 
large numbers to travel by train.
But advocates say as traffic  
congestion grows on North American 
highways and concern increases  
about managing natural resources wisely, the climate improves 
significantly for passenger rail.
“This is a very exciting and important 
time for passenger rail,” Cummins’ 
Kennedy said. “Our hope is the high 
technology we’re developing coupled with our deep knowledge of engines 
will help Cummins customers develop 
successful solutions to moving  people quickly and efficiently, with  
as little impact on the environment  
as possible.”RAIL BUSINESS WINS GOLDEN SPANNER AWARDS
Cummins’ rail business in 2014 celebrated achievements in powering 
customers in the United Kingdom, winning several prestigious Spanner 
Awards in London.
The awards, hosted annually by industry magazine Modern Railways, 
recognize the work of the U.K. Rail Maintenance Depots located  
throughout the country in maintaining the vehicles that transport  thousands of passengers every day in the United Kingdom. 
The awards divide train fleets into categories and award the best  
operators from each category: Golden Spanners for the most reliable  fleet, Silver Spanners for the most improved fleet and Bronze Spanners  
for the fleet with the fastest incident recovery. The assessment is based  
on performance data for reliability and engineering performance in the  rail industry.
Cummins-powered train fleets scored big in the 2014 awards  
ceremony with a total of three Gold Spanners, two Silver Spanners  and two Bronze Spanners. 
“The team at Cummins provides innovative and reliable power and support 
to our award-winning customers so they can be successful in their business goals as they serve thousands of passengers every day,” said Cummins  
Rail and Defense Business General Manager Melina Kennedy. 
“These awards are due to the successful collaboration, hard work  
and partnerships among many people and organizations and exemplify 
Cummins’ promise of dependability to our customers,” she added.24

OF CUMMINSSUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // 
ENVIRONMENT
CUMMINS ESTABLISHES  
NEW SUSTAINABILITY GOALS
Cummins is establishing new goals to address two of the 
Company’s biggest environmental opportunities, improved 
efficiency of its products in use and more efficient logistics 
within Cummins’ own operations.
“Going forward, Cummins will continue 
to be a catalyst for environmental 
action,” said Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer Tom Linebarger. “Our vision and mission demand it, 
our business success depends on it, 
and the ingenuity and energy of our employees can make it happen.”
The new goals are in addition to  
the goals the Company set publicly  for waste, water and energy in  
2014 (page 27). 
Cummins’ Action Committee for 
Environmental Sustainability (ACES) 
has been working on the new goals  
for the past year, which, like the  2014 goals, are timed to 2020.  Here’s a look at the new goals:
 
 PRODUCTS  IN-USE GOAL
Partner with customers to 
improve the efficiency of our 
products in use, reaching by 
2020 an annual reduction of  
3.5 million metric tons (MMT) 
of carbon dioxide (CO2), saving 
350 million gallons of fuel. 
Cummins produced 1.1 million engines 
in 2014 (including joint ventures), and  
carbon dioxide emissions from these 
engines in use represent 99 percent  of its CO
2 footprint. The Company knows it can make  a difference in this area, having  
done more than 100 fuel-economy 
projects with Cummins customers using Six Sigma tools since 2004. 
Those projects saved customers  
more than 100 million gallons of  fuel and prevented the release of  
more than 1 million tons of CO
2  
into the atmosphere. 
The projects included optimizing 
vehicle specifications and engine operating parameters, fleet and  
driver training and advanced  
engine integration with the vehicle.
Market research studies show  
fuel efficiency is one of the most 
significant factors when a customer buys equipment that uses fuel.  
Fuel efficiency projects with customers 
not only saves them money while reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs), 
it also upholds Cummins’ promise of 
dependability and customer support. It is not uncommon for the Company’s 
engines to run one million miles or 
more over their lifetime, so there is plenty of opportunity to help customers 
keep their engines running longer and 
more efficiently. 
Cummins defines products in-use 
engines as those that are currently in 
operation or a new original equipment manufacturer (OEM) installation that 
incorporates new approaches for fuel 
efficiency. These new approaches can be applied at the OEM, with customers 
at their location after they purchase 
the product from an OEM, or at a distributor branch. 
In 2014 alone, the 
Company’s fuel-efficiency 
work reduced CO2 
emissions from products in use equal to the CO
2 
footprint of Cummins’ global facilities.Environmental Icons

LOGISTICS GOAL
Use the most efficient method 
and mode to move goods 
across the Cummins network 
to reduce CO2 per kilogram of 
goods moved by 10 percent  
by 2020. 
Transportation is a key element of 
the logistics process that impacts 
the supply chain from suppliers 
to customers. Transforming how Cummins moves raw materials  
and finished goods across the supply 
chain is at the core of the Company’s transportation, logistics and warehouse 
strategy as well as an important priority  
 
 area for its global environmental sustainability plan. 
Cummins spends close to  
$442 million in transporting goods 
across the Cummins network. In 2014, the Company adopted a transportation 
network optimization initiative to get 
the most out of its transportation system as part of Cummins’ larger 
supply chain transformation. 
The Company is now using a global 
transportation management system 
to improve the speed and visibility 
of goods moved and have better analytics to manage the process. 
Adding a goal for CO
2 reduction not 
only will quantify the environmental benefit that Cummins expects  
to achieve through this system,  but accelerates and expands its  
efforts globally. The main focus of the Company’s 
goal is on shipments from suppliers 
to Cummins facilities and shipments 
between Cummins own facilities, as  its business units supply each other. 
The transportation management 
system will help Cummins reduce  the total number of miles goods travel 
by combining shipments of different 
products going to common locations. The Company will also be able to 
reduce the number of less-than-full 
truckload shipments. 
The management system will also 
help Cummins’ logistics professionals 
choose the most efficient way – whether by road, rail or sea – to ship 
them. As a result of these efforts, the 
Company expects to save $40 million to $64 million annually. 
Cummins is taking a phased-in 
implementation approach, which began as a pilot in North America in 
2014 followed by a European launch 
in January 2015, with India integration occurring in the third quarter of 2015. 
The logistics team is working with the 
Company’s many internal business unit and external stakeholders to achieve 
this goal as Cummins transitions from 
third-party providers to a self-managed process. Working with carriers in India, 
Brazil and Asia-Pacific is a priority, as 
those are regions where Cummins can achieve the biggest CO
2 reductions. 
The Company’s new Southern Indiana Logistics 
Center is expected to help the Company move products much more efficiently (page 128).Environmental Icons

THE POWER  
OF CUMMINSSUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // GOALS
CUMMINS MAKES PROGRESS  
ON ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS 
Cummins made significant progress on all of the goals it 
established in 2014 to reduce its use of water and energy 
and the waste it produces in its facilities.
The Company is close to its energy 
goal, which is tied to 2015, and is 
already close to its overall target  
for water consumption by 2020.  But officials say it remains to be seen  
if the Company can reach its water 
goal over an extended period of time.
“We want to show we can consistently 
meet these goals before we develop 
new ones,” said Mark Dhennin, Cummins Director of Energy Efficiency 
and Environment. “We’re off to a good 
start and there’s been some great work done, but there is still a lot of work 
ahead before we can say we met  
our 2020 goals.” 
Here’s a 12-month progress  
report on each of the six goals 
Cummins established: WATER 
GOALS
Reduce direct water  
use across Cummins  
by 33 percent by 2020,  
adjusted for hours worked.
Achieve water neutrality at  
15 Cummins manufacturing 
sites where water is in short supply, also by 2020.
BASELINE YEAR: 2010
Cummins used 972 million gallons of 
water in 2014. While this is an increase  
of 14 million gallons from 2013,  
the number represents a 9 percent 
decrease in water use intensity since  
last year. Since the goal’s baseline year  
 of 2010, direct water use is down by 14 percent, while water use adjusted for 
hours worked is down by 36 percent. 
As the Company prepared to 
establish its water goals, some sites 
began their efforts even ahead of 
the announcement. In fact, four sites including three engine plants in China 
and the Technical Center in Columbus, 
Indiana (U.S.A.), saved more than  67 million gallons, about 7 percent  
of the Company’s total water use  
in 2014. These achievements  have placed Cummins ahead of its  
33 percent goal, but the Company  
is not yet ready to claim success. 
With several new facilities open  
that are continuing to ramp up 
production, Cummins must  ensure it continues producing  
results through the next phase of 
growth and production demands. 
 
 The Company’s water neutrality  
work is progressing as expected. 
Working toward achieving this goal 
is promoting awareness about the connection between water use in  
the Company’s plants and the  
needs in its communities. 
Cummins defines water neutrality  
as off-setting the Company’s own 
water use at a particular location through conservation and with 
community improvements that  
either conserve water or make  new water sources available.
Because the Company is still validating 
its calculations, Cummins is not yet prepared to confirm sites as water 
neutral, but has approximately six 
sites, primarily in India, that have implemented significant projects 
toward achieving water neutrality. 
The Company’s efforts already 
underway range from expanding water 
reservoirs in Pune, India; to creating Environmental Icons

on its public waste management  
goals. In fact, the Company’s sites in the United Kingdom have already 
achieved a collective 99 percent 
recycling rate. The Company all together recycled 90.4 percent  
of its total waste generated in  
2014, equivalent to approximately  165,000 metric tons of waste.Since the baseline year of 2010, 
Cummins’ total waste disposed 
decreased by about 22 percent in absolute terms, while experiencing 
a 41 percent reduction in disposal 
adjusted for hours worked.  Compared with 2013, Cummins’  
total waste disposed in 2014 
decreased by 2,000 metric tons  on an absolute basis or 20 percent, 
adjusted for hours worked. 
Facilities and operations staff have 
updated some waste management 
processes to ensure goal success.  
The team is conducting “deep dive” waste evaluations at the 10 sites 
that account for 50 percent of the 
Company’s waste disposal. A waste reduction toolkit will be included in the 
formal waste reduction plan at those 
sites. Concurrent quarterly waste reviews by business unit and region  
are expected to provide greater  
insight into progress and facilities  best-practice sharing. 
As with the Company’s water neutrality 
goal, Cummins has formalized its definition of “zero disposal.” Four sites 
have been validated as zero disposal 
under this criteria. There is currently   one site awaiting validation as  
zero disposal.
Under Cummins’ definition of zero 
disposal, waste can only be burned 
for energy recovery after reasonable 
efforts have been made to reduce, reuse or recycle, and then only if  
there is a net energy gain, creating 
more energy than is needed merely  to sustain combustion. 
ENERGY  
AND GHG GOALS
Reduce energy use and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by 25 percent  
and 27 percent, respectively, compared to a 2005 baseline 
and adjusted to sales, by 2015. 
BASELINE YEAR: 2005
The focus on energy and greenhouse 
gas was the first company-wide 
initiative of its kind at Cummins, targeting a specific set of 
environmental impacts around the 
globe. An initial goal was set for 2010.  
 
 Achieving the second goal by 2015  will require the Company to double  
its energy efficiency reductions at  the same time Cummins’ business  
is changing. 
The Company is adding several new 
buildings that will use energy but not 
produce revenue, engage in more 
joint ventures in the engine business, and produce more high-horsepower 
engines, which require a lot of fuel  
to test. 
These changes have been challenging, 
but Cummins is on track to meet  
both its energy and GHG goals.  The Company is leveraging lessons 
from programs such as the ISO50001 
energy management system and the Department of Energy’s Superior 
Energy Performance program. 
In 2014, the Company’s GHG 
emissions both increased on an 
absolute basis (up 8.6 percent) and 
decreased when adjusted for sales (down 2 percent) from the prior year. 
Compared with the energy / GHG goal 
baseline year of 2005, emissions have decreased 35 percent, while increasing 
by 10 percent on an absolute basis. Environmental Icons

SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
CUMMINS PRODUCTS ALWAYS  
HAVE THE ENVIRONMENT IN MIND
Products are at the center of the Company’s vision to make 
people’s lives better by unleashing the power of Cummins.
From powering fire trucks that keep 
communities safe, to heavy-duty  
trucks that deliver goods, to generators 
supporting hospitals, Cummins makes a difference around the world by 
working to meet the needs of all  
of its stakeholders.
The Company’s technology leadership 
and innovation enable Cummins to 
meet increasingly more stringent 
emissions regulations across the 
globe. The Company’s customers  
have come to depend on Cummins’ clean technology for the power and 
reliability they need to succeed, 
whatever the job.
Product stewardship means the 
Company has an environmental 
mindset about its products as employees think about their design, 
use, remanufacture and end of life. Here is Cummins’ view of  
product stewardship: 
ENVIRONMENTAL  
IMPACT ANALYSIS 
After an intensive study and analysis, 
Cummins adopted its first-ever 
comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 that builds on the good work the Company has 
previously done in this area. 
This new plan prioritizes actions 
by Cummins to address its biggest 
environmental opportunities, from the materials the Company buys to the 
emissions of its products. Cummins 
examined its entire environmental footprint, focusing on the key areas  
of water, waste, energy and 
greenhouse gases (GHGs). 
 It was clear from this analysis that 
the Company’s top priority must be 
products, both in design and in use. The analysis led Cummins to establish 
its products in-use goal (page 24)  
and design for environment initiative.
PRODUCT DESIGN
There will always be a need for moving 
goods and providing power for the world to do important work, and it 
is critical to develop technologies 
that will do those in the cleanest and most efficient way possible. Cummins 
engineers are thinking about ways  
to make the Company’s products  even more environmentally friendly  
in the future. 
Seventy percent of a product’s 
environmental footprint is determined 
during the earliest phases of the  
design process, according to the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA). So Cummins has tremendous potential to reduce both the resources used to make a product as well as how 
much fuel is burned when that product is put to use. 
After the Company completed a 
lifecycle analysis (LCA) on its flagship ISX15L engine in 2013, Cummins 
continued to approach product 
stewardship with a lifecycle mindset. Since the material-embodied energy-
to-weight ratio is consistent across 
all engine sizes, the Company is using this comprehensive information 
to develop Cummins’ design for 
environment strategy. The Company will continue to perform LCAs on other 
Cummins products as necessary.
The Company’s design for environment 
strategy will focus on materials and 
fuel efficiency. Improving fuel efficiency 
not only means reducing the fuel consumption of Cummins products, 
but also includes designing for 
alternative energy sources as well as PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT31
reducing the amount of fuel burned in 
the Company’s development testing.
Material efficiency includes designing 
with less material and designing with circular material flow in mind, 
such as recycled material use and 
remanufacturing.
Cummins is beginning to integrate 
tools and training programs into its 
new product development process to take into account the environmental 
impacts of all phases of the product 
lifecycle, including raw material extraction, manufacturing, product 
use and end of life. Cummins expects 
to report more on its design for environment strategy in 2016. PRODUCTS IN USE
While Cummins products can change 
the world for the better, the Company 
must also ensure it minimizes the environmental impact of its products  
in use, helping customers reduce  
their own environmental footprints. 
On-highway transportation  
represents approximately 20 percent  
to 30 percent of the world’s GHG emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions 
from Cummins products in use are 
the Company’s largest environmental impact and represent 99 percent  
of Cummins’ greenhouse footprint  
due to fossil fuel use, which emits carbon dioxide (CO
2).
 Cummins biggest opportunity to expand its product stewardship beyond the upfront design will be 
working with customers to improve the 
efficiency of its products in use. This is a win-win as it saves customers money 
for fuel and it reduces greenhouse gas 
emissions. And through the Company’s products in-use goal, Cummins can 
make a difference right now (page 24). 
The Company has partnered with 
customers on fuel-efficiency projects 
for many years. As part of Cummins’ 
Environmental Sustainability plan,  the Company has added more people 
and tools to accelerate and expand 
this important work. High-horsepower engines in use are a priority given the 
large amount of fuel they burn and  
the corresponding CO
2 emissions.  Based on previous Cummins fuel-efficiency projects, the Company expects that a 3 to 5 percent reduction 
in fuel usage can be achieved for many 
customers through optimization tools, system-level expertise and various  
fuel-economy engine features. 
REMANUFACTURING
Cummins’ remanufacturing is  
the Company’s “green business.” 
Remanufacturing maximizes benefits for customers and the environment 
by planning and designing Cummins 
products to have a long and increasingly more fuel-efficient life.
In 2014, some 50 million pounds 
of Cummins product was put back into use thanks to remanufacturing. 
Remanufacturing requires about 
85 percent less energy than manufacturing the same product with 
new parts. Water is saved since new 
metal does not need to be extracted.
Remanufacturing at Cummins had 
sales of about $595 million in 2014. 
The Company’s remanufacturing   
 
Cummins puts millions of pounds of product 
back to useful life through the Company’s remanufacturing operations.
On-highway and mining 
engines account for  
74 percent of Cummins 
product CO2 emissions. 
Eighty percent of product 
CO2 emissions come  
from engines fewer  than 10 years old.32
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
operations include nine global facilities 
and offer about 4,500 part numbers.
Through the common application 
of salvage technology, component re-use guidelines and remanufacturing-
specific policies and procedures, the 
Company has become increasingly sophisticated in what it can  
remanufacture and for how long  
it can extend a product’s life. 
In many cases, remanufactured 
products today are “upcycled”  
to include design, emissions, fuel  economy and quality upgrades. 
Lighter, more compact engine designs 
combined with new materials (compact graphite and aluminum) and special 
coatings are changing Cummins’ 
approach to remanufacturing and making engines more fuel efficient.  
The Company is also developing 
specific rebuild kits to improve fuel economy at time of rebuild. The old methods of grinding and machining are gradually being replaced 
with additive technologies, specialized 
coating technologies and more.  The emerging field of mechatronics, 
which combines mechanical and 
electrical engineering and computer science, is creating new systems such 
as robotics and digitally controlled 
combustion engines. 
The Company is also investing in 
technologies to assess remaining 
useful life. The expanding number  of emissions control components,  
such as diesel particulate filters,  
also present business opportunities  for remanufacturing.
REGULATORY INTEGRITY
Cummins’ product stewardship 
is underpinned by the Company’s 
commitment to regulatory integrity, 
advocating now for cleaner and  more efficient products for the  
future, and ensuring improvements 
intended by regulation are delivered  in the real world. 
Cummins has a long history of 
supporting regulatory actions to make the environment cleaner, going back  
to the 1970s as a strong advocate for 
the Clean Air Act in the United States.  The Company continues to advocate  globally for sound public policy and regulations that are tough, clear  
and enforceable.
There is growing public demand for 
better environmental regulations of 
all kinds by governments in almost 
every country. Customers increasingly need Cummins’ products to meet new 
environmental regulations and provide 
the power and reliability that helps them compete and win. By getting out 
in front of regulations and participating 
in the rule-making process, the Company is in a very good position  
to not only comply but excel.As more regions around the world 
consider regulating greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHGs) and fuel 
consumption, Cummins sees an opportunity for technological innovation 
that can benefit vehicle owners and  
the environment. The Company supports a separate engine standard 
in these regulations to provide a clear 
direction for innovation, addressing  the component that burns all the fuel  
and emits the carbon dioxide (CO
2).  
It ensures enforceable requirements.
A regulatory framework that includes 
a combination of engine and vehicle standards is also the most cost-
effective way for customers to realize 
fuel savings and retain their ability to choose the right powertrain and 
vehicle to purchase in order to do  
their work. 
MATERIAL COMPLIANCE
Material compliance is a key 
component of Cummins’ product stewardship. The Company maintains 
a comprehensive corporate policy 
regarding the use of prohibited and restricted substances in its products. 
Cummins’ policies take into account 
key global environmental regulations  as well as very specific ones driven  
 In 2014, Cummins 
remanufactured  
15,673 engines;  
6 percent of them were originally manufactured  
in 2010 or later.This report includes a lot of statistics 
about carbon dioxide (CO2 ), a colorless 
gas that contributes to global warming.  In many instances, statistics are based on metric tons of CO
2 . 
So, how much is a metric ton of CO2?

by the European Union such as 
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 
and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), and End of Life Vehicle for 
automotive products. 
REACH addresses the production 
and use of chemical substances 
and their potential impacts on both 
human health and the environment, while RoHS restricts the use of certain 
hazardous substances in electrical  
and electronic products. 
Compliance with the Company’s 
policies is designed into the materials 
it uses and Cummins partners with its suppliers to ensure the Company’s 
global compliance requirements are met.
Responsible sourcing of  
minerals is important to Cummins.  
The Company maintains global  
policies to carry out key processes such as the Reasonable Country of 
Origin Inquiry process, consistent  
with the Organization for Economic  Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) due diligence framework.
 Cummins’ efforts resulted in a process 
both compliant to Section 1502 of the 
Dodd Frank Act in the United States 
on conflict minerals, and one that sets the expectation of responsible sourcing 
practices throughout the Company’s 
supply base. Conflict minerals are mined in conditions of armed conflict 
and human rights abuses in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo and adjacent countries.
U.S. laws require companies that are 
publicly traded on U.S. exchanges to disclose whether they use specified 
minerals from those countries such  
as tungsten, tantalum and gold in  their products (page 117).
PRODUCT SAFETY
Cummins’ Mission demands that 
everything the Company does 
leads to a “cleaner, healthier, safer 
environment.” That makes product safety a top priority. Cummins  
Product Safety Policy says:
 »Cummins will design, manufacture, 
sell, distribute and service all 
products so that they are safe  
to use for the described and  intended purpose. »Cummins will provide its customers, partners, employees and society 
with products that are safe to 
operate, maintain, adjust and  repair when used as intended.
 »Each Cummins employee  will regard product safety  as a top priority.
 »Each Cummins employee is responsible for applying the  policy in his or her individual  
and collective work activity.
 »Each Cummins employee  
is expected to adhere to the  
spirit as well as the letter of  
the Product Safety Policy.
Cummins has a set of standardized 
corporate and local policies and 
procedures in order to meet the Corporate Product Safety Policy. 
Each Cummins Business Unit has  a Product Safety Committee that  
is accountable for applying the  
policies and procedures in its area. 
These Product Safety Committees 
integrate into the Corporate Product 
Safety Council, which is managed 
by the corporate Director of Product Safety. This network allows for 
collaboration and rapid communication 
on safety-related matters. 
In compliance with the Company’s 
Product Safety Policy in 2014, 
Cummins voluntarily initiated five product safety campaigns impacting 
approximately 91,000 Cummins 
engines and/or Cummins components. These campaigns were reported to the 
relevant public agencies as required 
by applicable laws and improvements were made on each of the products  
at issue. 
Cummins Power Generation employees conduct 
a product safety review on a generator at the business unit’s test facility at Manston, Kent, United Kingdom. 
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT34
BEST PRACTICES
The ongoing work Cummins does  
with customers for on-highway truck  
and bus, construction equipment  
and mine vehicles helps the Company incorporate best-practice improvements 
in subsequent installations. 
POWERSPEC
Cummins’ PowerSpec is a powerful electronic tool that supports customer 
fuel efficiency beginning at the ordering process and continuing through 
the life of the vehicle. The tool can optimize equipment set-up during the 
order, tailor operation of the engine by customizing electronic parameters and provide real-time data and information for optimal in-use performance.
CUSTOMER SPECIFIC PROJECTS
Cummins and its distributors work with end-
user customers, often including their partners 
and suppliers, on projects that are tailored 
to each customer application and operation. 
Project scope includes data collection, analysis 
and specific improvement recommendations.
DRIVETRAIN AND  
EQUIPMENT OPTIMIZATION
Cummins collaborates extensively with vehicle  
and equipment manufacturers and suppliers,  
such as Eaton and Allison Transmission,  
to design products that meet customer  
needs while improving efficiency. This work  
also includes hybrid and start/stop technology.
ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS AND FEATURES
Cummins continually improves engine calibrations  
and increases the options available to customers such  
as recent additions ADEPT (idle cruise management,  
page 38), naturally aspirated air compressors  
and Connected Diagnostics (page 38).
PARTNERING WITH CUSTOMERS 
FOR BETTER FUEL EFFICIENCY
Cummins provides a complete set of collaborative solutions 
to help customers maximize their fuel efficiency and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. From the development of 
products that are optimized for specific market segments,  to the use of software to assist in the truck specification 
process, to the ability to customize electronic engine settings 
and parameters, Cummins helps customers reduce their carbon footprint throughout the life of the truck. 35
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PRODUCTSENGINE BUSINESS
Cummins produces engines for on-highway use, off-highway use and 
high-horsepower engines for mining, rail, marine, oil and gas, and power 
generation applications. On-highway engines range from engines for pickup 
trucks to the engines for large tractor-trailers hauling freight. Off-highway engines include engines for construction, agriculture and industrial uses.
Tremendous strides have been made in engine emissions in North America 
since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began regulating them in the 1970s. On-highway diesel engine emissions, for instance, are down 
more than 95 percent for particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx), 
reaching near-zero emission levels. 
Advances in fuel economy, meanwhile, have greatly reduced the output  
of carbon dioxide (CO
2), a key contributor to global warming. 
Cummins has been a pioneer in clean diesel technology, advances in combustion, electronic controls, fuel systems, filtration, air handling, exhaust aftertreatment 
and more to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. It has achieved  
these advances both working on its own and in partnership with others. 
For example, in the highly competitive North American Heavy-Duty Truck 
engine market, Cummins and Eaton introduced a new powertrain package for the ISX15 on-highway engine in 2013 that produced industry-leading 
fuel economy. Through hardware and software enhancements, the package 
integrated power and fuel-shifting strategies to provide an estimated  3 percent to 6 percent improvement in fuel economy.
The two companies announced in 2014 that the SmartAdvantage  
Powertrain package (page 44) was being expanded to include  applications for the ISX12, a smaller engine ideal for regional hauling. 
In addition to diesel, the Company has also been a leader in the  
development of engines that run on biodiesel, natural gas and other alternative fuels to provide customers with the option that best works  
for them to meet their own sustainability goals.
All this knowledge comes together in the Company’s Engine  
Business Unit. Some of the most significant environmental sustainability  
developments in the business in 2014 and early 2015 start on the next page.NEW PRODUCTS  
REFLECT CUMMINS’  COMMITMENT  TO ENVIRONMENT
Cummins had another good year bringing new products  
to market in 2014. The Company introduced more than  
60 products or product updates, many addressing 
emissions, fuel efficiency or both.
The Company has a distinct advantage 
when it comes to designing and 
building clean, fuel-efficient engines 
and generators that provide the power customers need to succeed while 
meeting the regulations applicable  
in any particular market.
Cummins is the only independent 
engine manufacturer with the in-
house capability to produce all of the critical subsystems required to build 
an engine or generator. The Company 
believes its technical expertise gives it a competitive advantage as more countries enact stricter regulations  to protect their air, land and water.
The Company recognizes that its 
products must deliver real economic benefits to Cummins’ customers, 
including not just the performance 
customers have come to depend  upon but also reliability, durability  
and low cost of ownership, too.
Here’s a look at some of the 
major environmental sustainability 
developments in Cummins products 
over the past year, organized by business segment.PRODUCTS36SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PRODUCTS

Cummins has more than  
doubled the number of engines  
10 liters and above that it has 
remanufactured since 2008.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINS
ISB6.7  
AND ISL9
Allison Transmission Holdings and Cummins 
announced in March 2015 that they had  
received certification from the California Air 
Resources Board (CARB) to sell the model  year 2015 Allison H 40/50 EP hybrid propulsion  
system paired with the Cummins ISB6.7 and  
ISL9 diesel-electric hybrid engines for transit buses and coaches. The pairing was first 
announced in November 2014.
NOTABLE:  
Allison’s H 40/50 EP hybrid propulsion system is used 
for both straight and articulated transit buses. It has 
improved fuel economy up to 25 percent over similar diesel buses. Additionally, its regenerative braking 
capability can significantly extend the brake change 
interval by as much as 350 percent.
QUOTABLE:  
“Cummins is pleased the hybrid system has received 
2015 certification from the ARB as it will provide transit customers another viable solution designed to meet 
their business needs,” said Laura Chasse, general 
manager of the North American Bus Business.NOTABLE:  Cummins is applying its experience in diesel electric  
to introduce optimized ratings for variable speed diesel- 
electric technology that is ideal for low-load applications such as offshore support vessels, ferry boats, passenger  
vessels and fishing boats. Early reports show significantly  
reduced fuel consumption, reduced carbon dioxide (CO
2) 
emissions and lower system weight compared to fixed 
speed diesel applications.
QUOTABLE:  
“Cummins will play a critical role in the advancement of 
this more efficient technology, supplying engines to system 
integrators for packaging into complete variable speed diesel electric packages,” said Waldemar Marchetti,  
Director of Strategic Growth – Offshore.NOTABLE:  
The QSX15 features more horsepower and industry-leading hydraulic capacity in a durable platform. The QSX15 is 
manufactured at Cummins’ Jamestown Engine Plant in 
Jamestown, New York (U.S.A.), the heart of heavy-duty engine manufacturing at Cummins. Typically, more than  
400 engines are built per day at the plant.
QUOTABLE:  
“The Jamestown Engine Plant plays an important role  
in our Company’s ability to produce a broad range of 
engines for different customers around the world serving a wide variety of markets,” said Hugh Foden, Executive 
Director – Off-Highway Business. QSX15
Cummins announced in February 
2015 the start of production of 
the QSX15 for John Deere 9R/9RT

Cummins announced in August 2014 that its 
6.7L Turbo Diesel was the first diesel engine  
in a medium-duty vehicle certified to meet  
Low Emission Vehicle III standards from  the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
NOTABLE:  
The new standard applies to all vehicles under 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating.  
The Cummins 6.7L Turbo Diesel powers the  
Ram Heavy-Duty lineup.
QUOTABLE:  
“Being the first in this segment to certify to these 
new standards demonstrates our commitment to the environment and meeting more stringent 
requirements without hardware changes allows us to 
maintain the proven capability and reliability that our customers have grown to expect,” said Jeff Caldwell, 
General Manager – Global Pickup and Van Business.CONNECTED 
DIAGNOSTICS
Cummins announced in February 2015 details 
surrounding Connected Diagnostics, the first 
application within the Connected Solutions suite  
that has been designed to work with leading 
telematics providers. Cummins Connected 
Solutions is a group of products that utilize the 
connection of a Cummins electronic engine to  a vehicle’s on-board telematics system.
NOTABLE:  
Connected Diagnostics gathers engine data to provide customers with immediate expert 
recommendations in response to engine fault 
information. Connected Diagnostics utilizes Cummins’ expert guidance to provide thorough 
recommendations so customers can make  
the most informed decision at the time of the notification. This will help maintain productivity  
and maximize uptime for customers.

Cummins in March 2015 introduced ADEPT technology (Advanced Dynamic Efficient 
Powertrain), a new suite of electronic features 
that will deliver fuel-economy gains of up to  3 percent initially for ISX15 customers operating 
with automated manual transmissions.
NOTABLE:  
ADEPT utilizes load-, speed- and grade-sensing 
technology to initiate adjustments to speed, power 
and transmission gear to take advantage of vehicle momentum for better fuel economy. The technology 
also eliminates unnecessary downshifting to keep 
the engine operating in the most fuel-efficient “sweet spot.” The first ADEPT package will be available in 
the third quarter of 2015, and customers will be  
able to upgrade as future packages are released.
QUOTABLE:  
“The release of ADEPT in 2015 signifies Cummins’ 
commitment to deliver customer-focused innovation  as soon as it is ready for market,” said Amy Boerger,

REMANUFACTURING 
Remanufacturing of engines and parts  
provides customers with a high-quality, 
sustainable option that’s good for the 
environment and good for their bottom line.
Instead of sending tons of metal to landfills and  
the scrap heap, remanufacturing recycles and  
reuses resources, providing customers with significant savings while greatly reducing the  
need to mine new materials.
This conserves natural resources and minimizes 
the greenhouse gas emissions associated with 
excavating, refining and machining materials used 
for new parts. A Cummins remanufactured engine or part requires about 85 percent less energy than manufacturing a new engine or part. Cummins reclaims about 50 million pounds of product  annually, avoiding 200 million pounds of  
greenhouse gas emissions per year.
Every remanufactured engine or part is completely 
disassembled, cleaned, inspected, fully restored  
and tested to meet original specifications or better.  If an upgrade has been made from the original  design or material of a particular part or engine,  
it will be added as it is remanufactured.

GAS ENGINES
Cummins’ goal is to provide customers with 
the engine that makes sense for their particular 
sustainability needs. That’s why the Company 
makes engines that run on a variety of fuels, including natural gas.
Cummins has been developing a full line of natural 
gas engines both through its Engine Business and through Cummins Westport Inc. The joint 
venture partnership was established with Westport 
Innovations Inc. of Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada), in 2001.
Cummins Westport’s natural gas engines are 
available as factory-installed options from more  than 50 truck and bus manufacturers, establishing 
the joint venture as the leading North American 
provider of natural gas engines for on-highway commercial vehicles.
Independent of the joint venture, Cummins Engine 
Business has been building natural gas engines  for many years, especially in the Company’s  
High-Horsepower business, primarily for power 
generation and gas compression customers. 
Every remanufactured engine or part at Cummins  
is disassembled, cleaned, inspected, fully restored  and tested to meet original specifications or better.REMANUFACTURED ENGINES

QSK95 SERIES
Cummins Power Generation in November 2014 introduced the  
QSK95 Series, a new line of high-performance generator sets  
engineered with the highest kilowatt per square-foot ratio in its  
class, resulting in a smaller footprint that achieves a 20 percent improvement in power density. 
NOTABLE:  
The new series uses Cummins’ most powerful engine to offer best-in-class 
fuel economy. Over the course of 
8,000 hours of operation, the QSK95 can achieve fuel savings of more 
than $400,000. Fewer maintenance 
requirements, longer service intervals and 25,000 hours to major overhaul 
make these generator sets ideal as 
primary sources of power, but they  are also excellent for standby power 
with their smaller footprint and higher 
power density. QUOTABLE:  “The QSK95 Series produces up to  3.5 megawatts of power, occupying 
less floor space than lower-rated 
generator sets. They are designed to lower the total cost of ownership by 
reducing installation expenses, fuel 
costs and maintenance requirements—  
all while maintaining Cummins’ high 
standards of reliability,” said Tony 
Satterthwaite, then president of Cummins Power Generation. (He has 
since taken a new position leading the 
Company’s Distribution Business Unit.)POWER GENERATION
Cummins Power Generation is committed to providing products that minimize their impact on the environment. The business unit is developing 
cleaner combustion techniques with natural gas and diesel reciprocating 
engine generators, plus factory-integrated exhaust aftertreatment that  allows these products to meet stringent global emissions standards.
As part of its global emissions strategy, Cummins Power Generation  
focuses on meeting or exceeding U.S. EPA and European Union  emissions standards, as these standards are the world’s most  
stringent and all-encompassing. This strategy assures end-users  
of the best power generation solution for their application,  regardless of country or continent.
Cummins Power Generation has been in the forefront of the move to  
cleaner, quieter and more efficient diesel engine-powered generator  sets, improving the fuel efficiency of all its engines because less fuel 
consumed means fewer emissions overall.
Sophisticated electronic engine controls have virtually eliminated  
visible smoke, and better engine design has reduced lubricating oil 
consumption to only 0.15 percent of fuel consumed – the best in  
the industry. Power Gen’s lean-burn gas engine generators used  in combined heat and power applications significantly reduce  
wasted energy and overall emissions.
Here’s a look at some of the key sustainability developments at  
Cummins Power Generation over the past year.41

GRID CODES
Cummins Power Generation announced in January 
2015 that certified Grid Code Compliant generator  
sets had been delivered successfully to a customer  
in Germany. Grid Codes have been introduced in Europe to help improve the stability of today’s  
power grids that have become increasingly  
reliant on numerous renewable energy sources.
NOTABLE:  
Transmission and distribution system operators in Europe 
are defining sets of rules that specify how grid-connected power sources must perform, including generator sets  
and their associated components. These rules, known  
as Grid Codes, require embedded generation schemes  to stay connected to the grid during certain grid faults,  
unlike the traditional approach where generator sets  
could come off the grid at such times.
QUOTABLE:  
“With the growing demand to meet Grid Code  
requirements in Europe, the introduction of Cummins  Grid Code Compliant products means power providers  
can continue to rely on one manufacturer for their  
generator set needs,” said Andrew Stone, Cummins  Director of Global Project Companies. 
 
 GRID CODE  ALTERNATOR RANGE
Cummins Generator Technologies (CGT),  
a division of Cummins Power Generation,  
announced in July 2014 the availability of  
a range of “Grid Code Ready” STAMFORD  and AvK alternators. Customers will benefit  
from exclusive access to a certification  
modelling tool, which can be used with any  prime mover when used in conjunction with  
real-time practical data.
NOTABLE:  
The new Grid Code Ready line of alternators was  
engineered to meet global Grid Code regulations  
ahead of the German certification deadline.  Ranging between 25-10,000 kVA, the Grid Code  
Ready alternators are designed to help generator set 
manufacturers meet the global Grid Code legislation  roll out that started in Germany on Jan. 1, 2015,  
before progressing to the rest of Europe and beyond.

GENERATOR SET 
Cummins Power Generation in 
December 2014 announced it had 
extended its range of gas-fueled 
generator set capabilities with  a natural gas version that has  
U.S. EPA Mobile Off-Highway 
(MOH) emissions certification.  The introduction of the certified 
model means that the generator 
set is now deployable across a wider variety of applications.
NOTABLE:  
Natural gas represents an attractive energy source at sites where the 
resilience of a fuel supply is critical. 
In adverse weather conditions or in the aftermath of a natural disaster, 
the diesel fuel needed to maintain a 
vital service may run out before fuel deliveries to the affected area can be 
re-established. Generator sets that 
run on natural gas offer a significant advantage in that the gas they utilize 
can be supplied continuously even 
when other infrastructure, such as roads, are out of service.42
CUMMINS EMISSION SOLUTIONS
Cummins Emission Solutions (CES) designs, manufactures and integrates  
exhaust aftertreatment systems. It has grown into a more than $2 billion  
operation since it was created in 2002, propelled in part by the growing  
regulation of engine emissions around the world.
ECOFIT  
SINGLE MODULE 
Cummins Emission Solutions announced in March 2015 that  
it was introducing the first of its next generation of ultra-high  
efficiency aftertreatment systems, the EcoFit Single Module.  
The EcoFit Single Module is up to 60 percent smaller and  40 percent lighter than the EPA 2013 solution it supersedes,  
while improving emissions reduction performance.
NOTABLE:  
The smaller size enables better heat 
management and retention for improved  
fuel economy capability, while the 
simple single-pass exhaust flow design 
meets customer requests for a simpler, 
easier-to-integrate solution. QUOTABLE:  “We’ve achieved incredible results  
with this product through an entirely 
new engineering approach to aftertreatment systems,” said  
John Carroll, General Manager –  
CES’ Global On-Highway Business.

Modern diesel engines require extremely clean fuel and lubrications to support the very precise equipment that helps engines run efficiently and reduces engine 
emissions and noise. Cummins Filtration has been an industry leader in both fuel 
and lube filters. 
FLEETGUARD 
LF14000NN
Cummins Filtration announced in 
February 2015 the release of the 
Fleetguard LF14000NN lube filter 
for Cummins ISX15 diesel engines. It is the Company’s first lube filter 
with NanoNet media, a patented 
polymeric nanotechnology-based synthetic media originally 
developed for Fleetguard fuel  
filter applications.NOTABLE:  
NanoNet filtration media removes  
and retains 98.7 percent of all  particles as small as 4 microns  
(12 times smaller than the smallest 
particle visible to the human eye).  That process is critical to keeping 
engines running cleanly and efficiently.
QUOTABLE:  
“Many of the characteristics that 
make NanoNet media so successful 
in fuel filter applications translate well to lube filters,” said Brad Long, 
Senior Engineering Technical Advisor, 
Cummins Filtration. “By pairing NanoNet with our proven StrataPore 
synthetic media, we can offer a lube 
filter that’s suited to meet the needs of today’s advanced engine platforms 
and lubricants.”

HEAVY-DUTY FUEL PUMP
At a trade show in Germany in September 2014, Cummins revealed  
a selection of next generation innovations capable of improving the  
fuel efficiency of modern diesel engines. The selection included a  
new Heavy-Duty Fuel Pump.
NOTABLE:  
The new high-pressure oil-lubricated 
pump for heavy-duty engines, which complements the Company’s robust 
injectors, offers industry-leading 
injection pressure of 2600 bar and a leak-free system design that reduces 
parasitic loss, increasing fuel economy. 
The pump offers a highly modular and adaptable design which is lighter than 
previous pumps, allowing for flexibility 
in customer integration. QUOTABLE:  
“Over the last few years we have seen 
continued demand for smaller, lighter, high-quality components to drive

CUMMINS’ SMARTADVANTAGE PROVIDES  
FUEL ECONOMY FOR CUSTOMERS  
One of the Company’s most recent fuel-efficiency successes 
has been focused on engine and transmission integration. 
The SmartAdvantage Powertrain takes 
the power of Cummins ISX15 and 
ISX12 engines with SmartTorque2 
and combines it with the smooth shifting of the Eaton Fuller Advantage 
10-speed automated transmission for 
improved fuel economy. The engine and transmission share critical data, determining the torque required to 
deliver the power level that drivers 
need without wasting fuel. 
Customer feedback on fuel-economy 
savings and overall performance has been excellent and there have been 
numerous media accolades, including 
“top product” lists by publications  such as the Commercial Carrier 
Journal, Heavy Duty Trucking and 
Today’s Trucking. 
The SmartAdvantage Powertrain was 
named an Automotive News PACE 
Award Finalist for 2014, recognizing the innovation it has provided  to the marketplace.
Customer fuel-efficiency improvements 
using SmartAdvantage count toward meeting Cummins’ products in-use 
environmental sustainability goal  
(page 24). Average customer fuel-efficiency improvement was 3.3 percent in 2014, which in 2015 will translate 
into savings of about 2.3 million gallons 
of fuel, 23,400 metric tons of carbon 
dioxide avoidance and $9.4 million. 
CalArk is a 650-truck fleet based  
in Little Rock, Arkansas (U.S.A.), 
whose trucks deliver goods in the  
48 contiguous United States and Canada. The fleet has 100 International 
trucks equipped with SmartAdvantage 
and 50 more on order.
“We chose SmartAdvantage for the 
miles per gallon savings, plain and simple,” said Vernon Nance, who 
oversees CalArk truck purchasing as President of Arkansas Equipment 
Leasing, Inc. “Our drivers like the 
trucks overall and with help from Cummins we are still making changes 
in the settings that should help our 
drivers even more.”
CalArk saw a 5 percent total 
increase in fuel economy from using 
SmartAdvantage with a late 2013 ISX15 engine. Nearly half came from 
drive fuel economy from the engine and the rest from the benefits of the 
total SmartAdvantage package. The improvement is based on comparisons 
with trucks in the fleet that have an 
early 2013 ISX15 engine with Eaton’s Ultrashift Plus transmission. 
Cummins made improvements to 
CalArk’s earlier 2013 ISX15 engines using lessons it learned from the 
SmartAdvantage package. 
Mark Stanton is Maintenance Director for CalArk  
Trucking, which has seen a significant increase in  fuel economy using the SmartAdvantage Powertrain.

CUMMINS’ PRACTICES 
HELP PROTECT  ENVIRONMENT
Cummins is constantly working to shrink the Company’s 
environmental footprint with a special focus on the waste, 
water and energy Cummins uses in the production process.
The Company’s Enterprise 
Environmental Management System 
(EMS), created in 2003, plays a critical 
role in Cummins’ global environmental footprint reductions and other 
improvements. The Company  
adopted a model that includes a common framework to ensure a  
similar look, feel and fundamental 
approach throughout the organization.
The EMS has the flexibility to allow 
individual sites and businesses to 
address risks and opportunities most important to them. Cummins has 
integrated health and safety processes 
and procedures with the environment since 2007, in accordance with 
the international standard OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health & Safety 
Management System, to create 
the Enterprise Health, Safety and 
Management System (HSEMS)  (page 49). 
Here’s a look at some of the 
Company’s key practices and strategies in this important area:
WATER STRATEGY
Cummins’ global water strategy  
goes beyond conservation to  
address water as a business risk  
and a key consideration in building stronger communities, a central 
goal of the Company’s Corporate 
Responsibility initiative.The water strategy, adopted in 2011, establishes four priority areas:
 »Water conservation.
 »Water risk management in  business operations.
 »Water and community engagement. 
 »Water in the supply chain.
The Company recognizes that 
water is vital to food production, 
sanitation, power generation and more. So conservation is a goal at all 
Cummins sites. But the Company also 
recognizes water as an operational risk, especially in parts of the world 
where water is scarce. Cummins’  
environmental leaders provide scorecards, expert advice and more  to help sites manage that risk.
The Company’s strategy also takes into 
account the important role water plays 
outside of Cummins’ operations in water-scarce communities. Cummins 
works with community leaders in those 
locations to help them establish their own conservation initiatives. 
Finally, Cummins’ strategy  
identifies the critical role water  plays in the Company’s supply chain.  Cummins sites in water-scarce areas like  
San Luis Potosí use low-water vegetation  for site landscaping.
PRACTICES46Almost 90 percent of Cummins’  
water footprint exists in the supply 
chain, mostly associated with the 
extraction and production of metals. The Company is beginning to address 
this challenge by considering water  
in its material selection practices  and promoting awareness of  
water management techniques  
with its supply base and in its  purchasing processes.
As part of its strategy, Cummins has 
developed tools to help the Company better understand and prioritize its 
water management opportunities. 
Perhaps the most important tool is the water balance. By thoroughly 
understanding everywhere water goes 
in a facility, Cummins facility leaders   can often spot prime opportunities  for improvement.
For more detailed analysis, Cummins 
has developed true cost and risk analysis tools. Each of these tools  
help provide more insight into the  
often hidden costs of water. On-site costs include factors such as pumping, 
heating and chemical usage, which are 
often not considered when evaluating a project.
However, the most significant 
consideration can be the risk of  impacting production. By understanding  
this exposure, Cummins is working to promote equipment selection and management choices that mitigate 
risks where Cummins operates in 
water-scarce environments.WASTE STRATEGY
Cummins global waste strategy is  
built around the belief that through 
waste reduction, reuse and recycling, the Company can drive improvements 
in processes and procedures. It was 
developed after an in-depth study  of the Company’s waste footprint  
in 2011. Cummins has a robust 
database that contains waste  metrics as far back as 2005.
The Company uses a waste  
hierarchy consistent with current industry standards:
 »Cummins’ first priority is to  avoid the generation of waste.
 »The Company’s next priority  
is the reuse of waste.  »Recycling of waste is Cummins  
next priority.
 »Finally, waste to energy through incineration is only considered  after reasonable efforts have been 
made to reduce, reuse or recycle. 
Reducing packaging or “right-sizing” 
incoming parts are examples of ways 
Cummins tries to avoid the generation 
of waste. Reusing waste might involve reusing pallets or finding an alternative 
use without any reprocessing. 
Recovery and reuse of solvents is another example. The recycling of 
metals, paper or wood also reduce  
the amount of waste that has to  be disposed.
The Company’s ultimate goal is  
“Zero Disposal” at Cummins’ facilities. 
Cummins operations in water-stressed areas
Here are the four areas where 
Cummins facilities face the biggest 
water risk. Each of these locations 
also falls within the Company’s priority regions for achieving  
water neutrality (see page 27).

SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PRACTICES
The Company defines Zero Disposal  
as completely avoiding the disposal  
of waste according to Cummins’  
waste hierarchy. Waste to energy is only considered if there is no other 
option and it produces a net energy 
gain, creating more energy than needed to merely sustain combustion.
Cummins is also committed to 
avoiding the production of hazardous waste and properly handling hazardous 
materials in the workplace.
The definition for what constitutes 
hazardous waste varies widely  
by country. For U.S. sites that do  
produce hazardous waste, however,  Cummins has a formal pre- 
qualification process to ensure  
the waste is handled properly.ENERGY STRATEGY
Saving energy has bottom-line 
benefits. Cummins also recognizes the 
link between energy conservation and reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs). 
Reducing energy use is both a win 
for the Company and a win for the environment, too.
The Company’s strategy focuses  
on four key areas:
 »Saving and conserving energy  
by improving existing facilities
 »Building energy conservation  
into new construction
 »Optimizing manufacturing and product testing processes
 »Enhancing energy management
 Cummins is improving its existing facilities by installing high-efficiency 
“smart” lighting and energy-efficient 
windows, doors, walls and roofs  to reduce heat gain or loss.  
High-efficiency heating, cooling  
and recirculation systems also  create significant savings as well as 
energy-efficient boilers and burners.
Cummins has also been working to  
recover energy generated by engines 
and generators in its test cells by 
installing equipment that can capture that power for use by the plant or for 
sale to a local utility.The Company has established 
ASHRAE 189.1 international  
standards developed by the U.S. 
Green Building Council and others  as Cummins’ minimum standard  
for global construction. 
Cummins is also committed to 
obtaining certification for the 
ISO 50001 international energy 
management standard at 15 key facilities by 2016. Three of the  
15 have been certified. 
The Company will partner with the 
government under its strategy to

experiment with alternative forms  
of energy. For example, Cummins 
has significant solar installations at  
its facilities in Jamestown, New York  (U.S.A.), and Huddersfield in the  
United Kingdom.
Cummins is a partner in the U.S. 
Department of Energy’s Better 
Buildings Challenge, which includes 
the Jamestown facility (page 58).  The Company committed to a  
25 percent reduction in U.S. energy 
efficiency intensity by the end of 2015, and achieved a 42 percent reduction 
by the end of 2014. GLOBAL BUILDING STANDARD
Cummins has nearly 550 facilities 
encompassing more than 34 million 
square feet across the globe. As of  the first quarter of 2015, 47 major  
new projects were under way  
at the Company with a planned  capital expense of $800 million  
over multiple years.
Having efficient buildings is not only a 
good return on investment, it is critical 
to reaching Cummins’ energy and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) goals. 
 
 Cummins’ global building standard 
is based on the international standard 
established by the American Society 
of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 
189.1 to ensure implementation of 
energy and water efficiency.
While the Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) Silver 
standard is an industry-respected norm, Cummins is a market leader  
with the adoption of ASHRAE 189.1.
Both the ASHRAE and LEED 
standards have been recognized  
 by the U.S. Green Building Council. Cummins expects ASHRAE 189.1  
to provide better realized returns and  allow the Company to consider the 
total cost of ownership in its buildings. 
ASHRAE 189.1, with its more international scope, is also a better  
fit for Cummins buildings. 
Cummins’ global building standard applies  
not only to new construction, but to renovations of older buildings as well, incorporating green features such as efficient lighting and water 
fixtures. The former Irwin Bank headquarters in 
Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.) underwent a major renovation in 2014 when Cummins took over  the property for office and conference space.49
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PRACTICES
At a minimum, all new buildings will 
be ASHRAE 189.1 compliant or LEED 
Silver equivalent unless business cases  
prove otherwise. In most instances,  
Cummins’ ASHRAE 189.1 compliant 
buildings would fall between the silver 
and gold LEED standard.
As part of Cummins’ 2015 investment 
plan to reduce GHGs, the Company  
will lessen its footprint in new buildings by making four considerations when 
choosing a building site: 
 »The region’s climate 
 »The carbon intensity of the  building and site 
 »The cost of the energy source 
 »The carbon intensity of the  energy source
Taking these four factors into  
account with the ASHRAE  
189.1 standard, Cummins expects  
its buildings will yield about a  21 percent emissions reduction.
 
  HEALTH, SAFETY  AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Cummins Health, Safety and 
Environmental Management System 
(HSEMS) ensures a common approach 
to implementing the Company’s  environmental standards at its sites 
worldwide. The system has served 
as the framework for driving continual improvement and efforts beyond 
compliance at Cummins operations  
around the world. Cummins expects  all sites to comply with policy, 
procedures and initiatives. 
Cummins’ HSEMS model deploys a 
common framework to ensure a similar 
look, feel and fundamental approach 
throughout the organization, with flexibility to allow individual sites and 
businesses to address opportunities 
and risks most important to them. Broad objectives and targets are set 
at the corporate level to establish 
direction for critical corporate initiatives. Cummins’ business units  
and sites then build upon them to  
 EMPLOYEES CELEBRATE JUNE ENVIRONMENTAL MONTH
Carpooling in San Louis Potosí, Mexico; a facility-wide dumpster dive 
(pictured below) in Charleston, South Carolina (U.S.A.); community  
water conservation in Dewas, India; more than 12,000 “Find it. Fix it.”  reports in engine plant sites — these are just a few of the actions  
10,000 employees took at home, work and in the community  
during Cummins’ 2014 Global June Environment Month.
The Company celebrated the announcement of its Global Environmental 
Sustainability Plan by dedicating an entire month to environmental 
education and action. Cummins asked employees during the month of June to engage in environmental stewardship at work, at home and in  
the community by reducing personal water and energy consumption  
and minimizing waste. 
These actions are not only consistent with the Company’s environmental 
mission and vision, but mirrored the goals set forth in the plan. Weekly 
education materials and project models helped site leaders spread the  word and provide guidance.
In 2015, Cummins will add a “personal tracker” tool, which will allow 
employees to commit to specific environmental conservation actions.  The monetary savings and environmental benefits, customized by region,  
can be communicated back to employees so they can understand the  
positive environmental impact they are making.

establish site-specific objectives  
that align with Company priorities  
but address site-specific needs  
and challenges.
Cummins policies apply to more than 
just its employees, also extending 
to contingent workers, suppliers, contractors and even clients working  
at Company facilities. Cummins’ 
expectations extend beyond the Company’s physical boundaries, 
encompassing maintenance and  
support services that often occur at customers’ locations or even remote 
areas where its products are used.
Cummins strategically drives 
certification to recognized  
standards. Since 2003, the  
Company has focused on its manufacturing locations with  
90 percent of manufacturing  
sites certified to ISO14001 and  OHSAS 18001. By 2015, Cummins 
expects the HSEMS Enterprise 
to consist of dual-certified sites, representing 100 percent of the 
Company’s manufacturing and  
distribution locations. By the end of 2014, the Company’s independent auditor certified  
104 entities, representing 347 sites 
and corporate offices as part of the HSEMS. Cummins’ HSEMS scope 
has been extended to encompass 
manufacturing joint ventures and distributors. They are committed  
to registering their sites by the  
end of 2015. 
By incorporating practices and 
procedures into the HSEMS to 
meet the new ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard, Cummins has 
delivered a common global approach 
to make energy efficiency a standard practice across the Company. 
Broad objectives and targets are set 
at the corporate level to establish direction for critical corporate initiatives. 
Cummins’ business units and sites 
then build upon them to establish site-specific objectives that align with 
Company priorities but address site-
specific needs and challenges. At the Global level, three sites obtained the 
ISO 50001 certification in 2013 and 
eight sites worked toward their ISO 50001 implementation in 2014,  
with a certification target for 2015.AUDITOR CERTIFICATION 
PROGRAM
Environmental goals are measured 
through a structured audit process. A third party auditor, Bureau Veritas 
Certification (BVC), certifies the  
health, safety and environment  (HSE) management enterprise  
system and the environmental  
metrics Cummins collects. 
Two of Cummins’ key sustainability 
stakeholders, the Carbon Disclosure 
Project and Dow Jones Sustainability Index, consider independent data 
verification an important factor in 
their evaluation of environmental performance and transparency. 
Cummins believes the audit validates 
its considerable efforts at data quality, placing the Company among a 
relatively small number that pursue this 
level of performance and validation.
Since 2011, BVC has also audited 
Cummins’ environmental footprint and 
the Company’s data collection and verification processes. BVC’s audit 
included greenhouse gases (GHGs),  
water used, landfilled waste and   recycled materials. They provided  an audit report with “limited 
independent assurance,” which  
the Company included as part  of its external reporting. 
Cummins supplements the audit 
sampling conducted by BVC by conducting its own annual audits using 
internally trained HSE auditors. Every 
site is audited on an annual basis.
The Company has developed 
an internal environmental auditor 
certification process, where employees complete a training course and then  
a series of audit levels. In 2014,  
more than 60 people have been trained and there is a pool of 96 HSE 
leaders certified as HSE Lead Auditors. 
This structured audit program  
validates performance and provides  
a mechanism for HSE auditors  
to share best practices. Through  these practices, Cummins is not  
only improving sites – it is building  
the Company’s next generation  of HSE leaders.51

CUMMINS EMPLOYEES IN THE  
U.K. ARE DETERMINED RECYCLERS
Employees at Cummins Turbo Technologies (CTT) in 
Huddersfield, United Kingdom, don’t have one or two 
recycling bins to choose from when they separate their  
waste – they have nine color-coded receptacles. 
The plant also has a special waste 
segregation yard to make sure 
recycling remains are properly  
sorted before they are hauled away. And a leaderboard in the plant reports 
not only on the facility’s progress in 
recycling, but also encourages some healthy competition among employee 
groups at the site.“We continually strive to improve our  
waste management operations here 
at Huddersfield,” said Jennifer Hirst, 
Facilities Energy Engineer at the plant.  “We conduct waste dives and welcome  
overall waste reduction ideas and  suggestions. Through positive integration, CTT continues to push the boundaries 
within sustainable operations.”It’s perhaps no wonder that the plant won the Campbell Institute’s 
prestigious Innovation Challenge  for the Environment award for 2014.
To say Cummins facilities in the U.K. 
take recycling very seriously might be something of an understatement. 
In addition to the Campbell Institute 
award, Company facilities won two national recycling awards for their 
waste minimization and recycling 
efforts – Corporate Recycler of the Year and the Waste Prevention  
Award – from Materials Recycling 
World in the U.K.
The group recognizes best practices 
inside and outside the waste industry 
in the United Kingdom, including both the public and private sector.
Cummins facilities in the country 
reduced their total waste generated  by 30.76 percent or 8,729 metric  
tons between 2012 and 2013 and  
 increased their recycling rate from  
96.4 percent to 98 percent. These results 
cover Cummins sites in Cumbernauld, Darlington, Daventry, Huddersfield, 
Kent and Stamford, as well as offices 
and regional distribution centers.
Achieving these kind of results are 
critical if Cummins is to meet its 
environmental sustainability goals for waste. Those goals call for the 
Company to increase its recycling  
rate to 95 percent by 2020 and achieve “zero disposal” status at  
30 Cummins’ sites by that same year.
“This recognition is the result of the 
hard work and commitment exhibited 
by the many people involved in the 
region’s waste reduction efforts,” said Ernie Smith, Environmental Affairs 
Manager and leader of Cummins’ 
waste efforts. “Congratulations to all.”
Cummins Turbo Technologies employees in 
Huddersfield make multiple sorts in their waste for recycling before trash leaves the plant. HUDDERSFIELD’S ADVICE
Here’s some advice from CTT 
Huddersfield on how to put together an effective recycling program:
 »Do the research.  Employees like to see the business case and review data.
 »Keep working even when roadblocks or resistance occur.
 »Work with individual areas  within the site to see what  works for them.
 »Effective communication is extremely important. 52

EMPLOYEE TEAMS RECOGNIZED 
THROUGH FACILITIES  ENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS
Cummins has challenged employee teams since 2005 to complete improvement  
projects that reduce the Company’s environmental footprint in the more than  
200 Cummins facilities and operations globally. 
In appreciation of their efforts, the 
Chairman’s Environmental Award 
recognizes employees and teams 
that implemented outstanding environmental improvements at their 
sites. Winning projects were chosen 
based on the greatest environmental impact, economic efficiency, employee 
and leadership engagement, innovation 
and replicability. 
Of the 30 projects submitted, the New 
and ReCon Parts project from San 
Luis Potosí, Mexico, was named the Top Environmental Project. The project 
saved water by installing water-free 
urinals, reduced water demand from cooling towers, and saved water, 
energy and chemicals used during  
the cylinder head salvage process. In recognition of their achievement, a team representative presented the 
project to the Cummins Board of 
Directors. In addition, representatives from the top three winning projects 
shared their work during the Six  
Sigma Expo along with leading Six Sigma and Health and Safety projects.
The winners of the Chairman’s 
Environmental Award are often viewed as best practices for other facilities 
to implement because they have 
been proven effective. As Cummins continues to set environmental 
performance goals, the Chairman’s 
Environmental Award-winning projects  
are important to help the Company  
find innovative, bottom-up solutions  
to minimize waste, water and energy. “A major reason that Cummins has been able to confidently put forth 
new and ambitious environmental 
sustainability goals is because of  the excellent work that teams like 
these have been doing in Cummins 
facilities and operations for years,”  said Alan Resnik, Director of  
Facilities and Operations  
Environmental Management. 
“I congratulate all of the teams for 
their outstanding results, creativity 
and continued enthusiasm for the environment,” Resnik said.

By various means, Cummins helped 
provide an additional 20 million gallons  
of water to village residents living near 
the Company’s Megasite in India.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINSSUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PRACTICES
MAKING CONSERVATION WORK  
AT CUMMINS’ MEGASITE
Water is a precious resource in much of India. So when 
Cummins employees at the Company’s Megasite in Phaltan 
looked at sustainable water management techniques to meet 
their water goals, they wanted to make a difference not only at the site but in nearby communities, too.
“Our employees working at the 
Megasite are going beyond the good 
they are doing at work to conserve 
and preserve the water supply for the villagers who live near our site,” said S. Ravichandran, Head of Corporate 
Responsibility for Cummins India.  “Not only is it one of our environmental 
sustainability goals, but it’s also the 
right thing to do to help our local 
farmers enhance their living by making water available for drinking as well as agricultural purposes. Our work has 
helped bring an additional 80 acres  of land under cultivation, resulting  
in increased agricultural output and better incomes to the farmers.” 
The site has made significant progress 
toward water neutrality, which at Cummins means consistently reaching 
the equivalent of what the Company 
uses at any particular site either through water conservation at the 
site, water conservation within nearby 
communities, developing other sources of water or by some combination of 
the three. But it’s too early to declare 
complete success.
The Megasite currently has eight plants 
in operation in addition to a general 
administration building housing a health center, childcare center and 
a gymnasium. The site consumed 
14 million gallons of water in 2014. Cummins is working to accomplish 
water neutrality through a three-fold approach: water conservation within 
its own operations, within the nearby community and by developing public 
water bodies. 
REACHING OUT
Water conservation at the Megasite 
itself is being accomplished by limiting 
the use of treated water, stopping water leaks at the site, using drip 
irrigation for landscaping so water is 
released slowly, harvesting rainwater, using low-flow water fixtures and by 
other steps. 
Outside the Company’s property, 
Cummins employees met and spoke 
to many villagers, farmers and rural 
government leaders in order to fully understand their water needs and 
water availability. 
Rainfall alone isn’t enough to meet 
everyone’s needs. Villages lack proper 
water management techniques and 
had no initiatives to improve ground 
Cummins helped build two storage areas capable 
of holding 10 million gallons of water for use by  the villages near the Megasite in Phaltan, India.55
water percolation; so what rain the 
area received often washed quickly 
away. Farmers who had land but 
not enough water were left with no choice but to do other work, impacting 
agriculture in a significant way. 
In Nandal village, de-silting the 
retention area behind a dam increased 
the capacity of the tank, resulting in  
an estimated 10.5 million gallons  of water being made available. 
Cummins helped build two more  dams of 38,600 metric cubic feet, 
which could store another 10 million 
gallons of water. Teaching villagers  
how to maintain the improvements  was also an important part of making 
these improvements sustainable.  
The outreach effort at the village won one of the Company’s 19 
Environmental Challenge grants.  
The Challenge is a competition sponsored by Cummins’ Corporate 
Responsibility team (see page 77). 
ENERGY MANAGEMENT
Cummins looks at plant improvements 
holistically, and while it is ideal to 
have solutions that save both energy and water, sometimes one must take 
precedence over another. For example, 
in the Phaltan high-horsepower plant, non-evaporative coolers were installed to help control the temperature. While not ideal from an energy perspective, 
they are critical in water-scarce areas 
because evaporative coolers use a lot of water to achieve their cooling effect. 
By installing regenerative 
dynamometers to capture the energy produced in engine test cells, the 
plant was able to save both energy 
and reduce cooling load. This allows cooling systems to be smaller. With 
the reduced cooling demand and the 
recovered power, the Phaltan location was able to implement air cooling 
systems that, while less efficient by 
themselves, give an integrated solution that improves energy and water 
positions for the site as a whole across 
both media. High-horsepower engines require of a lot of testing fuel because 
of their large size. In traditional testing, energy from the 
engine is dissipated, and therefore 
wasted, through evaporative cooling 
towers. Cummins uses the AC regenerative dynamometer to capture 
the mechanical energy of the motor 
and return (or regenerate) it to the  AC power source. Through this 
project, the Company saved  
$35,036, 1.2 million liters of water  and achieved a 12 percent reduction  
in greenhouse gases. 
It’s steps like those, Megasite 
leaders say, that will help them 
reach the Company’s Environmental 
Sustainability goals.THE POWER OF THE SUN
At the India Parts Distribution 
Center at the Megasite, the 
team reduced GHG emissions by 27 percent by opening the 
building up to more natural light. 
The plant also installed solar 
panels to provide hot water for 
the cafeteria and for washing 
utensils. In addition, the plant installed solar streetlights, and 
motion-sensing lights in the 
manufacturing and office areas.Village residents join Cummins employees in 
marking the start of work to store more water  for residents living near the Megasite.

SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PARTNERSHIPS & POLICY
CUMMINS’  
PARTNERSHIPS PRODUCE GREEN RESULTS
Cummins’ partnerships have helped the Company meet  
its product emissions goals, use energy more efficiently  
and much more. Cummins’ policy advocacy has helped  
bring environmental solutions to the marketplace. 
Four of the Company’s  
10 environmental sustainability 
principles focus on partnerships  
with legislative and regulatory entities to develop sound public policy to 
reduce Cummins’ impact on the 
environment. They are:
 »Help develop responsible regulations
 »Promote technology development
 »Advocate for incentives to  accelerate progress
 »Support a balanced global approach
Cummins worked closely with the U.S. government and a variety of 
stakeholders to develop the Phase 
1 rule, the first-ever greenhouse gas (GHG) and fuel-efficiency standards in the U.S. for medium- and heavy-duty 
commercial vehicles. The Company is 
now working with regulators to build on the success of Phase 1 and help 
shape the next stage of GHG and fuel-
efficiency standards known as Phase 2. A key aspect for Phase 2 is to 
maintain the same regulatory structure 
with separate standards for the engine and the rest of the vehicle. Separate 
standards are critical for the regulation 
to achieve environmental and user benefits while recognizing the diversity 
and complexity of the commercial 
vehicle sector. 
 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION 
Cummins longstanding partnerships 
with the U.S. Department of Energy 
(DOE) and other federal and state 
agencies directly support the United States’ goal of reducing greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions and net oil 
imports. The partnerships also help the U.S. achieve further improvements in 
energy productivity while sustaining a 
steady reduction in criteria emissions from the nation’s transportation and 
distributed power generation fleet.
The Company’s current and recently 
completed public-private projects  
involving DOE, except where  
noted, include:
 »The SuperTruck Project team 
significantly exceeded its engine and vehicle freight efficiency targets and completed its 55 percent brake 
thermal efficiency (BTE) technology scoping and demonstration efforts. 
The team identified two clear BTE 
pathways, one using diesel fuel  and another using alternative fuels.
 »The ATLAS (Advanced Technology Light Automotive Systems) project team significantly exceeded its  
40 percent fuel economy 
improvement target, at Tier 2 / Bin 2 criteria emission levels, by 
delivering a 60 percent improvement 
in Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Maria Vargas  
talks with Randy Myers, Jamestown Engine  Plant (JEP) Director of Machining and Facilities, about the plant’s energy efficiency efforts.

(CAFE) compared to the program’s 
gasoline engine powered baseline 
½ ton pickup truck. Numerous 
innovative engine features delivered outstanding performance and 
emissions while weighing  
80 pounds less than the all-aluminum gasoline baseline  
engine, including aftertreatment.
 »The SLTNR (Sustained Low 
Temperature NOx Reduction)  
project was launched in early 2015 
to develop and demonstrate catalyst and reductant delivery technologies 
capable of improving the robustness 
of high-performance NOx (oxides of nitrogen) aftertreatment over 
temperature-challenged real- 
world-duty cycles.
 »The EDPCI (E85/Diesel Premixed 
Compression Ignition) project was 
also launched about the same time, building on learning from SuperTruck 
(see page 72), to develop and 
demonstrate high-efficiency dual- fuel engine operation in Class 8 
trucks that commonly haul freight  
on North American highways.
 »The Ultra-Low Carbon Powertrain 
program (also known as ETHOS, see page 70), a partnership with 
the California Energy Commission, 
significantly exceeded its  
50 percent greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target through 
a downsized medium-duty engine/
powertrain optimized for E85 ethanol. Vehicle tests completed 
in Sacramento, California (U.S.A.), 
showed a 50 percent to 80 percent GHG reduction, depending on  
the drive cycle and type of  
ethanol feedstock.
 »The HD Ultra-Low NOx Natural 
Gas program, a partnership with 
California’s South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) 
and other California entities, is 
developing 0.02 gram/bhp-hr NOx technologies, while maximizing 
engine efficiency. This technology 
addresses the needs of regions in California and other places 
worldwide where significant  
ambient air-quality issues persist.
Underlying Cummins’ system-
integration programs is a valuable 
portfolio of collaborative research and development agreements that team, 
and fund, world-class researchers at the DOE’s system of national 
laboratories with their counterparts  
at Cummins. They jointly work on  
such things as combustion modeling  and diagnostics, materials science, 
catalysis fundamentals, hybridization 
and more.
ENVIRONMENTAL  
DEFENSE FUND 
Cummins continues to collaborate 
with the Environmental Defense Fund 
(EDF) to learn more about fugitive 
methane emissions from natural gas vehicles and the fuel supply chain. 
Through the sponsorship of a series 
of 16 independent studies, EDF is coordinating the work of close to  
100 universities, research facilities  
and industry partners that are contributing to this research  
including Cummins and the joint 
venture Cummins Westport. 
Information is being collected in  
several core areas: production, 
gathering lines and processing facilities, long-distance pipelines  
and storage, local distribution  
and commercial trucks and  refueling stations.As producers of natural gas engines, Cummins and Cummins Westport  
are contributing to the study of  
fugitive methane emissions related  to evaporative losses and incomplete  
combustion from vehicles, and fugitive 
emissions associated with fueling infrastructure. The study is led by  
West Virginia University. The results  
of the study will be submitted for  peer-review in 2015.
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS 
The Company’s Government  
Relations staff continues to advocate 
globally for policies, legislation, 
government research funding and regulatory guidelines that promote 
products and technologies that  
benefit the environment. 
Cummins’ Government Relations 
efforts in the United States include 
working with Congress, the White House, state governments, trade 
associations and industry to support 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in developing greenhouse  
gas regulations in the U.S. for  
heavy-duty vehicles, and to broadly  educate policy makers about how SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT58
regulations, economic development 
and competitiveness can co-exist if 
developed properly. 
In India, Cummins pushed for  
new generator emission standards 
recently released by the federal 
government for generator engines below 800 kW. Cummins strongly 
supported the adoption of these  
new standards, which will help  improve India’s air quality.
In the transportation area, the 
Company is pushing for stronger emissions and fuel-economy 
rules, along with low sulfur diesel 
requirements across the country. Cummins also worked with the Society 
of Indian Automobile Manufacturers 
(SIAM) to organize the “Emissions Roadmap for the Future” roundtable in 
Delhi, which was attended by industry 
and government representatives who discussed the importance of diesel fuel 
efficiency as well as a clear emissions 
roadmap for India.
In China, Cummins is advocating  
for an overall effective enforcement  
 environment for emissions regulations and a non-discriminatory certification/
testing mechanism for engines 
and vehicles. The Company also supports a broad consensus on fuel-
economy regulations by working with 
government, trade associations and industry partners. 
Cummins is encouraging the U.S. 
government to provide technical assistance and share best practices 
based on its leadership in this area 
of regulation. The Company is also working with the Chinese government 
to identify opportunities to promote 
combined heat and power solutions, telematics, natural gas engine 
applications and hybrid technology. 
In Colombia, Cummins worked with 
the U.S. and Colombian governments 
to eliminate barriers for the 
importation of remanufactured goods. Remanufacturing provides benefits  
for the environment by using about  
85 percent less energy compared to the mining, refining, melting and 
machining of new material.
 CUMMINS’ JAMESTOWN ENGINE PLANT  
RECOGNIZED FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Cummins’ Jamestown Engine Plant showed off its energy-efficiency efforts in 2014, 
earning a “top visit” accolade from U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) officials.
When the Company joined the Better Buildings, Better Plants program as  
a Challenge Partner in 2011, it was required to share a Showcase Project,  
one that models leading energy-efficiency practices, involves significant  
investment and results in substantial energy savings. 
Cummins’ plant in Jamestown, close to the famed Lake Chautauqua in New  
York state (U.S.A.), was undergoing a deep retrofit upgrade that made it the  
perfect choice. Critical equipment had been updated, leading to increased  
energy efficiency, as well as greater reliability and operational stability.
The Company initiated a phased, whole-building energy and infrastructure 
improvement project, setting aside $5.1 million specifically for energy-efficiency 
projects. Leaders say the plant is on track to achieve a 30 percent reduction in 
energy use and cost.
Maria Vargas, Senior Program Advisor in the DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency  
and Renewable Energy and Andre deFontaine, Program Manager in the  
Advanced Manufacturing Office, came to tour the plant in late 2014,  
joined by several members of the media. Plant leadership updated them on heating, air conditioning and air handling 
upgrades; LED lighting on the shop floor; compressed air and roofing improvements and the 2 megawatt solar array on the roof. It is capable of generating about a third 
of the plant’s power on the sunniest days. There are more than 7,000 solar panels 
covering about half a million square feet on the roof.

reporting initiative, supported by  an institutional investor consortium  
that seeks to encourage greater  
public environmental reporting  among companies. 
CDP asks companies to provide  
details on their carbon emissions,  their response to the impact of  
climate change on their markets and 
regulatory environment, their use of energy and planning for the future. 
Cummins has participated in the  
CDP Water Disclosure Project for  the past two years and was one of  
a handful of companies to agree  
to have its responses scored. Cummins’ water program was  
rated in the “leadership” category.60
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PARTNERSHIPS & POLICY
RESEARCH PARTNERSHIP ON EMISSIONS  
HELPS PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH
Cummins’ partnerships to address emissions  
regulations go back many years. 
In 1977, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) amended  
the Clean Air Act to place new controls 
on diesel emissions and the industry was challenged to adapt to the 
unprecedented regulation. 
At the time, very little was known  
about the effects of diesel emissions on health. In response to the EPA’s 
new regulation, then Cummins 
Chairman and CEO Henry Schacht 
decided to form a consortium of 
experts and interested parties to objectively and independently study 
the health effects of diesel emissions. 
Guided by the belief that all of society 
benefits from objective and rigorous science, Schacht brought the engine and vehicle industries together with 
then EPA Administrator Doug Costle 
in 1980 to form the Health Effects Institute (HEI). Funded jointly by  
the EPA and industry, HEI is a  
non-partisan and not-for-profit organization committed to providing high-quality, impartial, and relevant 
science regarding the effects of air 
pollution on health. 
HEI has funded more than  
250 studies in North America,  Europe, and Asia, producing important 
research on carbon monoxide, air 
toxics, nitrogen oxides, diesel exhaust, ozone, particulate matter, and other 
pollutants. The institute’s work has 
been published in over 200 research and special reports. 
 
Cummins and health effects experts discuss  
the future of diesel emissions during a panel hosted by Cummins in Columbus, Indiana  (U.S.A.), in February 2015. 61
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // ENVIRONMENT // PARTNERSHIPS & POLICY
Thirty-five years after the creation of 
the institute, Cummins’ partnership 
with HEI is just as strong as it was  
at the institute’s creation. As it has grown, HEI’s work has continued  
to investigate health effects in 
anticipation of regulation. Cummins relies on the institute as a trusted 
source of information when  
working with regulators worldwide  to create clear, responsible and 
enforceable emission standards.
“In the inimitable words of Henry 
Schacht, ‘facts are friendly,’” said  
Brian Mormino, Cummins Executive 
Director of Worldwide Environmental Strategy and Compliance. “We aren’t 
afraid to ask the tough questions. 
 Our currency is credibility and credible health effects science is the bedrock  
of good regulations.”
The institute posed some tough 
questions in a recent study that was 
the first to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of lifetime exposure  
to exhaust from new technology  
diesel engines (NTDE). It found no 
evidence of carcinogenic lung tumors. The Advanced Collaborative Emissions 
Study (ACES) also confirmed that the 
concentrations of particulate matter and toxic air pollutants emitted from 
NTDE are more than 90 percent lower 
than emissions from traditional older diesel engines (TDE). 
“This study is significant because 
it is the culmination of 30 years of technology development to clean 
diesel exhaust,” said Cummins’  
Rich Wagner, Director of Global Product Certification and Compliance. 
Cummins’ relationship with HEI is 
mutually beneficial; the Company often provides technical consultation 
and guidance to HEI studies. For 
example, Cummins served on the working group for the lifetime exposure 
study and helped identify the study’s measurement techniques of emissions 
levels that are also used in Cummins’  
own research and development of 
emissions technology. 
“The lung tissue samples that showed 
clean results are really a credit to the 
engineers who were able to bring emissions levels down so low,”  
said Dan Greenbaum, HEI President,  
during a health effects panel discussion hosted by Cummins in February 2015.
Even as improvements have been 
made to diesel emissions, air quality continues to be a serious challenge in 
many parts of the world. According to 
the World Health Organization, urban outdoor air pollution is estimated to 
cause 3.1 million premature deaths  
per year worldwide. 
To reflect this reality, HEI has expanded 
its research in India and China where 
ambient particulate matter pollution is the fourth largest disease burden 
causing premature death and in  large cities like Beijing where vehicle 
emissions are the largest source of 
dangerous particulate matter. 
Other strategic topics for HEI include 
studying the health effects of biofuels, 
the toxicity of gas direct injection in 
passenger vehicles (GDI), and  examining the impact of traffic  
and port emissions on health.

INNOVATION
INNOVATION’S KEY  
ROLE AT CUMMINS
At Cummins, innovation is one of the Company’s six core 
values, calling on employees to “apply the creative ingenuity 
necessary to make us better, faster, first.” That value is 
almost tangible at any of Cummins’ global network of technical centers.
The Company’s Advanced Engineering 
and Technology organization looks out 
six to 10 years and sometimes longer, 
well upstream of product development. The engineers and scientists who make up this group are discovering, 
inventing and applying the  
most advanced technologies  
in engines, power generation and 
related products. Their work is vital  to Cummins’ sustainability.
It’s a critical time for research and 
technology. For years, increasingly stringent North American emissions 
regulations have driven innovation at 
the Company. Now that engines have reached near zero emissions levels, 
that’s not as true.Asked about the future of innovation 
at Cummins, Dr. John Wall, Vice 
President – Chief Technical Officer, 
puts it this way:
“We need to know our markets  
better than anyone else. We need  
to know our technologies better  than anyone else. And we need  
to be able to combine these so  
we can differentiate our products  in the eyes of our customers.”
THE CUMMINS COMMITMENT
In just the past five years, Cummins 
has more than doubled its investment 
into research and development, 
increasing its contribution from $362 million in 2009 to $754 million in 2014.The Company uses very powerful computer models to simulate  the harsh environment inside an  
engine and how an engine works 
in real-world applications. To get the computing power it needs, 
the Cummins Technical Center in 
Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.), regularly works with Indiana University’s Big Red II super computer, one of the fastest research computers in the world. 
Cummins researchers can study many 
design variables using these computer models before an engine is ever put 
in a test cell. That saves money on 
Aleksey Yezerets, Cummins Director of Catalyst 
Technology at the Tech Center in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.), says there is a chemical plant behind every Cummins engine.
INNOVATIONINNOVATIONSUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // INNOVATION63
fuel and other related expenses while 
also making it possible to develop 
much more robust designs that simply 
weren’t possible when the majority of testing was conducted in a test cell.
Computers today can simulate the 
interaction between the engine and the vehicle while running a specific 
route almost anywhere in the world, 
according to Tara Hemami, Director –  Systems Performance Analysis.  The simulations can even account  for different driving styles – fast,  
slow, or a driver who is more erratic.
Cummins is always studying design 
advances. For example, it has virtual 
reality available in technical centers in 
Columbus, Indiana; São Paulo, Brazil, and at its newest global tech center 
scheduled to be completed in India  
by the end of 2015 (see page 73). 
CUMMINS PEOPLE 
The most powerful computer models, 
of course, won’t get a company far if it doesn’t have the right people using 
them. The Cummins research and 
technology team is smart, diverse  and dedicated to finding solutions  
for customers.
Today, most of the new hires in research 
and technology for salaried positions 
have doctorates or master’s degrees. 
The work is so complicated that Wayne Eckerle, Cummins Vice President 
of Research & Technology, likes to say “You have to love it.” Otherwise, 
an employee wouldn’t stay with it. 
Eckerle, by the way, has a Ph.D.  
in fluid mechanics.
Cummins not only has mechanical and 
electrical engineers working in research 
and technology but also chemists who are exploring the chemical reactions 
necessary to convert pollutants into 
something that can be safely emitted into the atmosphere.
“There is a chemical plant behind 
every engine,” said Aleksey Yezerets, Cummins Director of Catalyst 
Technology who works at the  
Tech Center in Columbus.
THE CUMMINS WAY
With fuel efficiency now getting more 
attention, Cummins is researching all kinds of alternative fuels as well as 
electrification. It’s also testing new 
processes such as 3-D printing and its potential to produce lighter, more 
complex components.Over time, Cummins has developed 
an effective way to conduct its product research. To help ensure general 
research continues into areas such 
as combustion and alternative fuels, that work is covered by corporate 
funds. As an idea becomes ripe for 
product development, Eckerle says its funding is taken over by the applicable 
business unit at the Company.
This is true not only in the United 
States, but for Advanced Technology 
Teams in India and China.
“We are a global team,” Wall said.  
“We benefit from the insights and 
talents of engineers all around the 
world who work together to deliver innovative technologies and products 
to our customers.”Wayne Eckerle, Cummins Vice President  
of Research & Technology, talks to a reporter from The Star in Indianapolis, Indiana (U.S.A.) about technology at the Company.

JULIUS PERR AWARDS
Fifteen years ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) mandated that beginning with the 2007 model year, 
pollution from heavy-duty highway vehicles would have to  
be reduced by more than 90 percent.
That requirement meant Cummins’ 
engineers and scientists had to cut 
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in diesel 
exhaust without compromising  power or price. 
The result of their hard work:  
13 patents that redefined the industry, put cleaner trucks on the road years 
before they were required, and earned 
every member of the Cummins team  that worked on the effort the prestigious Dr. Julius Perr  
Innovation Award.
“It was the experience of a career,” 
said chemist Neal Currier, a 22-year 
veteran of the Company. 
Currier was one of 13 Cummins 
scientists and engineers who received 
the Perr Award, given annually to the  inventors of Cummins’ technologies  that provide great value to  
the Company. 
The team, which was recognized at 
Cummins’ 2014 Technical Leaders 
Conference, received a total of  13 patents for NOx reduction 
technologies and the fundamental 
know-how developed during this project has since been used in all 
Cummins products for emissions- 
critical engine applications.
“We got cleaner trucks on the road  
years before they were required,  
 and that was beneficial for everybody,” 
Currier said.
The Perr award is named for Dr. Julius 
Perr, a Hungarian refugee who made 
his home in Indiana and spent 41 years 
as a mechanical engineer at Cummins. Dr. Perr submitted more than  
300 U.S. patents to improve engine 
technology and was named as inventor or co-inventor on 80 patents.
“These 13 individuals have carried on 
Dr. Perr’s legacy by making Cummins stronger through innovation,” said 
John Wall, Vice President and Chief 
Technical Officer.
Here are the Perr award winners and how  
many of the 13 NOx reduction patents  their names are listed on: 
Mike Cunningham (7), Neal Currier (3),  
Jim Fier (1), Sam Geckler (4), Lyle Kocher (2),  Wei Lu (1), Paul Miller (1), Sriram Popuri (5), Mike Ruth (4), Brad Stroia (3), Stewart Sullivan (1), Joan Wills (3), Alex Yezerets (2).65

CUMMINS GOES  
VIRTUAL IN LAUNCH  OF QSK95 SERIES
When it came time to introduce the largest generator set 
Cummins has ever built, the Company opted for a more 
environmentally friendly approach in keeping with the  
product’s fuel-saving capabilities.
Rather than invite potential customers, 
media and Company leaders to travel 
to the launch of the QSK95 generator 
series, Cummins brought the launch to anyone interested in the form of a 
digital trade show.
In early November 2014, Cummins 
President and Chief Operating Officer 
Rich Freeland and other senior leaders 
unveiled the generator sets via three web presentations scheduled during 
convenient business hours around  
the world. 
Visitors could check out the generator 
in the virtual Exhibit Hall or talk with 
Cummins employees and other visitors in the digital Networking Lounge.  
They could also watch presentations in 
adjoining rooms about the generator or hear from the Company’s top leaders.The only thing missing from the typical trade show experience? Tired feet – 
and who misses that?
Cummins worked with the international 
company ON24 Virtual Environments 
to build the online launch for the 
QSK95 Series. 
More than 2,000 participants attended 
the event, which was followed by more 
than 500 expert-led group chats and more than 400 private chats about  
the generator set.
During planning, Cummins  
estimated the cost of transporting  
150 participants and executing  
an in-person launch at more than $750,000. By comparison, the virtual 
launch cost less than $100,000 and 
saved a significant amount of jet fuel  with more than 10 times the number  of attendees. 
“We realized that we could  
showcase this powerful product  and all of its attributes in a way that 
saved the Company money and  
made it easier for people to be part  of the announcement,” said Craig 
Wilkins, who worked closely on  
the launch and now serves as  Director of Corporate & Global 
Strategic Accounts for Cummins 
Power Generation. 
The generator sets are engineered to 
deliver reliable, mission-critical power 
protection without interruption. Over the course of 8,000 hours of operation, 
the QSK95 Series can achieve fuel  
savings of more than $400,000.FEATURES OF THE  QSK95 SERIES
The QSK95 Series generator sets 
are engineered with the highest kilowatt per square foot ratio in 
their class, resulting in a smaller 
footprint that achieves a 20 percent improvement in power density. 
This means customers will need 
less space in their facilities, which lowers installed costs. And, in 
multiple-generator applications, 
fewer generators are required to achieve the desired power output, 
resulting in substantial cost savings.
The virtual launch for the QSK95 generator  
series saved both money and jet fuel to get  
people to the event.

IN MYANMAR, CUMMINS 
POWER GENERATION IS CONNECTING A NATION TO THE WORLD 
Imagine a nation where only 25 percent of the population has 
electricity and less than 10 percent have a mobile telephone.
Then, the government begins to shift 
to a more democratic system, and 
a nation with an extremely limited 
infrastructure and no global reach  is suddenly open for business.
Welcome to Myanmar, where 
Cummins Power Generation has been working with Irrawaddy Green Towers 
(IGT) since September 2014 to supply 
battery hybrid and diesel generator solutions sized from 8 kVA to 80 kVA 
with extra-large fuel tanks to power 
hundreds of new cell phone tower sites. Two-thirds of those sites are off 
the country’s insufficient power grid 
and located in remote locations.
 The end result will be a nation  
with open, accessible lines  
of communication. 
“With Cummins equipment  
working on these cell towers, we are 
empowering people in Myanmar to  
get connected to the rest of the world,” said J.P . Singh, marketing manager 
for the project. “Cummins has been 
developing this hybrid technology for years and is now working in close 
partnership with our customer in 
Myanmar to deploy it in a way  that will help millions of people.”
 
  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // INNOVATION67
Myanmar represents one of the 
few remaining telecommunications 
frontiers, but the new government 
wants to move quickly to expand access, pushing to grow from  
10 percent penetration earlier this 
decade to 80 percent by 2016. 
IGT contracted with Cummins to 
supply and install a power package 
that includes a generator, hybrid control and renewable battery pack. 
The Company is also working with 
IGT to potentially deploy additional renewable technologies.
Cummins’ advanced hybrid power 
systems are engineered to optimize capital expenditure while lowering  total cost of ownership and ensuring uninterrupted operations. 
The battery-hybrid model can cut the 
time the generator must run by more than half, extending its life by as much 
as two-thirds and significantly lowering 
diesel fuel usage and carbon dioxide (CO
2) emissions. These attributes are 
especially critical in a nation with a 
nascent and unpredictable power grid. 
“Leveraging our proven experience in 
hybrid power, we designed a hybrid 
product specifically for the telecom 
industry to provide the best value to our customers,” said Alan Zhao, 
director of the telecom business  
at Cummins.Not only is Cummins technology playing a key role in transforming communications for the 60 million 
people who live in Myanmar, but the 
conditions surrounding the installation of these power packages have forced 
Cummins to adapt in ways that will 
benefit the Company as it enters other markets with underdeveloped 
infrastructures.
Small changes can make an installation 
much faster as the components travel 
from a central warehouse to a remote 
project site where local residents must sometimes be enlisted to clear a path 
just to ensure a truck can access the 
installation site.
Cummins after-market engineer 
Kyle Anderson, who has overseen 
a number of Myanmar installations in country, described the logistics of 
deploying materials for hundreds of 
sites as “a little bit overwhelming.” 
Anderson recalled one installation 
where a generator set couldn’t be 
transported over a bridge because the truck weighed too much. The team ultimately found an alternative. Anderson said teamwork is key to 
getting through such challenges, and 
small changes that can speed up the process are enormously helpful. 
That’s why engineers working on the 
Myanmar project added forklift slots and eye bolts to the generators and 
cabinets to make transportation more 
uniform and efficient. These design changes have since been used for  
a rollout in Ethiopia and will be 
deployed in other challenging  territories in the future.
“We worked hard to develop 
technologies that are helping to  open up the telecommunication  
market and connect a nation to  
the world,” Zhao said. 
“Through that process, we’re also 
learning on a continuous journey 
how to make our product better and prepare for future projects,” he added. 
“Every challenge is an opportunity 
to develop solutions that make us stronger as a company, enable our 
customers to grow and help make  
the world a greener place.”
Cummins learned many lessons working  
to power cell phone towers in remote  parts of Myanmar.The battery-hybrid model supplied by  
Cummins can cut the time a generator  
must run by more than half, extending  
its life by as much as two-thirds.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINSSUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // INNOVATION68NEW NISSAN TRUCK INCLUDES CUMMINS’ 
INNOVATION, COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE
When you turn the key on the all-new 2016 Nissan  
TITAN XD powered by the Cummins 5.0L V8  
Turbo Diesel, it almost purrs to life.
Don’t be fooled. The TITAN XD is all 
tiger, no housecat. 
The powerful engine, a clean sheet 
design, was also developed to meet the latest emissions regulations using 
Cummins’ most recent innovations: 
sophisticated turbocharger technology, state-of-the-art filters and Selective 
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology 
that reduces emissions.
The result: a strong, fuel-conscious 
diesel engine to power Nissan’s light-
duty pickup truck line.
“There is no question that the new 
TITAN will turn heads, and with the 
available Cummins 5.0L V8 Turbo Diesel we expect to win new fans and 
attract buyers looking for this unique 
configuration,” said Fred Diaz,  Divisional Vice President,  Nissan Sales & Marketing,  Service & Parts, Nissan U.S.A.
The new pickup made its much-
anticipated debut at the 2015 North American International Auto Show in 
Detroit, Michigan (U.S.A.), followed by 
a celebratory event at the Columbus Engine Plant in January 2015, where 
the engines will be made.
Bringing the TITAN XD to life, though, 
has been a decade-long journey and  
a lesson in perseverance.
First, some background.  
The Columbus Engine Plant  
(CEP) was originally built around  
a two-story Civil War-era house purchased by Cummins co-founders 
Clessie Cummins and W.G. Irwin in 
Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.). It served as the Company’s 
headquarters in the 1920s and has 
been expanded 26 times, including extensive work in the 1940s during 
World War II. The building has been at 
the center of some of the Company’s most important developments.
 
President and COO Rich Freeland praises 
the dedication of Cummins employees in the development of the 5.0L V8 Turbo Diesel engine.69
“It’s difficult to walk from one end of 
this plant to the other without feeling 
a little nostalgic,” said Jeff Caldwell, 
General Manager of Cummins Global Pickup and Van business. 
About 15 years ago, however, 
Cummins stopped making engines  at the plant for a variety of reasons. 
“It was, quite frankly, a sad day for 
me,” said Cummins President and Chief Operating Officer Rich Freeland, 
a 35-year Cummins employee, 
speaking at the January ceremony.  “I always felt it left a hole in the heart  
of this company.”
Until the TITAN XD, that is.In 2006, the Company announced 
plans to build a light-duty diesel 
engine, but then the global economic downturn stalled the project. 
 
 “We were faced with the recession in 2009, and we came out of that with 
a great engine, a great plant, great 
people,” Freeland said. “We were missing one thing: the customer.” 
Enter Nissan and the TITAN. 
Discussions actually began in 2007, but it wasn’t until August 2013 before 
the partnership became official.
“This is an exciting announcement 
for our Cummins team,” Cummins 
Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger 
said at the time. “We are bringing our innovation and latest technology in 
engines and aftertreatment products  
to a new segment of customers.” 
Eighteen months and 150 new jobs 
later, hundreds of Columbus Engine 
Plant workers looked on as the truck they’d worked so hard to bring to life 
finally rolled onto the shop floor. 
 The 5.0L V8 Turbo Diesel success 
story would not have been possible 
without a Southern Indiana workforce 
and leadership that never gave up.
Freeland highlighted Cummins’ 
commitment to its employees at  
the TITAN XD launch in Columbus. 
“We are committed to winning and 
growing in Southern Indiana, and we’re 
committed to do it with our two unions. Other companies are running away 
from that, we’re running to it because 
we have terrific leadership and a terrific workforce here,” Freeland said.
Caldwell, the pickup and van general 
manager, lauded employees for sticking with the project and seeing  
it through to fruition.
“We’ve looked back. We’ve looked 
forward. Here we are today, and this  
is another big day in the history of  
the CEP ,” Caldwell said.ABOUT THE ENGINE
Cummins 5.0L V8 Turbo Diesel 
engine has been optimized for 
the next generation TITAN XD. Cummins also is developing 
a version of the engine for 
commercial vehicle customers.
This new engine will offer the right 
balance of power, performance 
and fuel economy while delivering the dependability Cummins 
customers expect. With a torque 
rating of 555 (lb-ft) and more than 310 horsepower, the Cummins 
5.0L V8 Turbo Diesel will provide 
light-truck customers the combination of towing capacity 
and mileage that is expected  
in the highly competitive  North American truck market.
The Cummins 5.0L V8 Turbo 
Diesel will be built at the Columbus Engine Plant in 
Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.).  
This plant has the latest technological innovations  
to continue the 90-plus-year  
tradition of building the highest quality Cummins engines.

CUMMINS’ ETHOS ENGINE  
SCORES BIG REDUCTIONS  
IN CARBON DIOXIDE
It may lack a sleek, aerodynamic design, but Cummins’  
ETHOS 2.8L Demonstration Vehicle still turned heads like  
a sports car as it cruised around California’s capital during  
the summer of 2014.
Built in partnership with the California 
Energy Commission (CEC), the test 
vehicle’s engine and powertrain 
reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions by as much as 80 percent 
during testing compared to a baseline, 
gasoline-powered, medium-duty truck.
CO2 is the primary greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emitted through human 
activities, accounting for the vast 
majority of GHG emissions in the United States. The ETHOS 2.8L  
engine is designed to use E-85,  
a clean-burning blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline,  
at diesel-like cylinder pressures to  
take full advantage of the favorable  combustion attributes of the biofuel.“The Cummins ETHOS engine, developed through a research partnership with CEC, clearly 
demonstrates that by combining 
innovative engine design and combustion approaches with low-
carbon alternative fuels, we can 
determine a path to significant reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions,” said Wayne Eckerle, 
Cummins Vice President –  Research and Technology.
The engine also delivered the power 
(up to 250 horsepower) and peak torque (up to 450 lb.-ft.) of gasoline 
and diesel engines nearly twice its 
2.8-liter displacement.Using corn derived E-85, the high-thermal efficiency and power-to-weight ratio of the engine resulted in 50 to 
58 percent lower well-to-wheels CO
2 
emissions compared with the gasoline engine baseline. Using second-
generation, cellulosic derived E-85, the powertrain’s efficiency features 
delivered 75 percent to 80 percent 
lower well-to-wheels CO
2 emissions, 
depending on the drive cycle.
Cellulosic E-85 uses non-edible 
plant sources so it is less intensive to produce in terms of land use, tilling, 
fertilizing and harvesting than corn-
based E-85. While not available in high volumes today, cellulosic ethanol 
represents a promising production pathway for future fuels because 
non-food feed stocks are dramatically 
more abundant. Two cellulosic plants 
started up in 2014 in North America and another was nearing completion 
in 2015.
The Cummins ETHOS 2.8L engine  
also incorporates an integrated stop-
start system, which further reduces  
fuel consumption and emissions.  In stop-start mode, the engine shuts 
down after the vehicle comes to a 
complete stop and the brake pedal remains depressed. As the driver’s  
foot is lifted from the brake, the  
system automatically starts the  engine to seamlessly allow  
acceleration from a stop.
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // INNOVATION71
Cummins’ system controls, along  
with a robust starter, smart alternator 
and sensors, handle the additional 
stop-start duty cycle and maintain reliable operation over the life of the 
engine. Cummins worked closely with 
Allison Transmission to integrate the 2000 Series transmission for smooth 
and efficient stop-start operation.  
The transmission is equipped with hydraulic circulation features to ensure 
smooth operation and quick vehicle 
launch during stop-start driving.Additional partners in the project included Valvoline, which provided NextGen engine oils specifically 
designed for lower CO
2 emissions,  
and Freightliner Custom Chassis, which provided a prototype MT45 
Class 5 step-van vehicle.
A final, on-road validation test phase 
took place in July 2014 in Sacramento, 
California (U.S.A.), managed by Cummins Pacific, the California  
and Hawaii distributor for Cummins. 
The project team made a final report to the California Energy Board in August 
of 2014 and prepared an academic 
paper on ETHOS in October of 2014.While the ETHOS project is over, it is still generating a lot of inquiries despite 
relatively low prices for diesel which 
has removed much of the cost benefits of ethanol. Meanwhile, product 
developers are looking for ways to 
incorporate the many lessons from ETHOS into future product designs.
Samuel Geckler, Director – Advanced 
Systems Integration at the Cummins Technical Center in Columbus,  
Indiana (U.S.A.), calls the ETHOS 
project “just outstanding.” But he says it can take some time for 
commercialization to take place  
on any initiative of this nature.There are many factors involved such as the availability of ethanol in general 
and the availability of the fuel from  
non-edible sources. That’s the nature of Cummins’s Strategic Principle  
to “Lead in Critical Technologies.”  
It requires looking 5 to 10 years ahead.
“It’s not unusual for a project like  
this to be done and for people to  
be working on this technology for  the next 10 years,” Geckler said.  
“But I think we have learned a 
tremendous amount from ETHOS.”

UPDATE: SUPERTRUCK’S NEW TRIP
After meeting the president and hosting dignitaries at the 
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Cummins-Peterbilt 
SuperTruck is finally getting a rest. 
But the most significant part of its 
more than four-year journey could  
just be starting.
“We learned a tremendous amount  
not just about features like waste  
heat recovery but about the base 
engine itself,” said David Koeberlein,  Cummins Principal Investigator  for SuperTruck. “This has been  
an extremely valuable project.” 
Done in partnership with the DOE, 
SuperTruck started in 2012 to spur 
innovation in the industry. Cummins 
partnered with the Peterbilt Motors Company, a division of PACCAR, to 
lead one of several SuperTruck teams. 
Their team had several objectives as part of the public-private partnership, 
including demonstration of a clean 
and highly efficient engine with an advanced waste heat recovery system 
and an aerodynamic tractor and trailer.
The Cummins-Peterbilt SuperTruck 
made headlines in February of 2014 
when the companies announced it 
achieved 10.7 miles per gallon (mpg) under real-world driving conditions. 
At one time, that would have been 
considered impossible. Most trucks today get between about 5.5 and  
6.5 mpg.
Using the industry leading Peterbilt 
Model 579 tractor, the Cummins-
Peterbilt SuperTruck was powered by 
an engine based on the Company’s ISX15. It converted exhaust heat into 
power delivered to the crankshaft, 
used route information to optimize fuel use, and included many other features.When U.S. President Barack 
Obama called for new fuel-efficiency 
standards for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles in 2014, he did it 
in front of the SuperTruck developed 
by Cummins and Peterbilt.
Work on SuperTruck wrapped up  
in a test cell. The final objective  
was developing a way for the engine to reach 55 percent Brake Thermal 
Efficiency (BTE), a key measure of 
engine efficiency. The engine went from 42 to 50 percent BTE during on-road 
testing. The Cummins team reached 
the 55 percent goal and work was completed in June 2014.
It remains to be seen how many of 
the SuperTruck’s features become commercially available, but Koeberlein 
says elements are already working  
their way into product development.
While it may no longer be on the road, 
he says SuperTruck’s influence could 
be around for years to come.

NEW INDIA TECH CENTER 
NEARS COMPLETION 
In Cummins’ journey to becoming a global company from  
a multinational, there is an increased focus on developing  
India as a global engineering hub for undertaking  
research and development for the Company worldwide. 
Against this backdrop, the Cummins 
Technical Center India (CTCI), is being 
established in Pune, Maharashtra, India. 
This new building will co-locate 
laboratories, engineering facilities and engineers from across India. Geared 
toward strengthening the Company’s 
capabilities to design technologies for 
the future, this Center will house over 
2,500 engineers and is expected to become fully operational in 2016.A global, cross business unit  technical center, CTCI will provide 
shared engineering services as well 
as business unit specific development capabilities and resources. A three-
level building, CTCI, once completed, 
will include 36 engine test cells and various labs along with engine-build 
and tear-down space and other areas 
essential to technology and product development, verification and  
validation work. Some of the unique architectural features of the design, which  
also strongly promote the  green building concept, are: 
 »Integration of test cells, labs and office space to create synergy and smoothen interaction and 
collaboration between all entities. 
Offices and social areas are well integrated with labs and test cells. 
 »Large atria with green spines introduced to allow natural light within the building, thus reducing  
energy consumption.
 »The combination of glass and clay 
tiles for the external façade, which  
insulates the building from external 
heat. Reflective surface for flat roofs to reduce heat gain.
 »Use of recycled material (e.g. bricks made of fly ash) and use of solar energy for hot water at cafeteria, 
street lights, etc. 
  »Energy-efficient  air-conditioning system.
 »Conducive design allowing easy accessibility to the differently-abled. 
 »Collaborative work spaces  
resulting in optimization of space.
 »Rain water harvesting.
 »Recycled STP (Sewage  Treatment Plant) water for  
gardening and flushing. 
Engineers will work together in 
leveraging their talent to bring  
about accelerated growth while improving productivity, profitability  
and maximizing customer 
responsiveness. 
With a vision to be a globally integrated 
technical organization that serves the 
needs of all business, both in India  and worldwide, the CTCI will be  
an extension of the Company’s  
One Cummins approach.
The Cummins Technical Center India is  
scheduled to become fully operational in 2016.74SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
EMPLOYEES  
TAKE CORPORATE  RESPONSIBILITY  VALUE TO HEART
Cummins employees continued to leverage engagement 
to build stronger communities in many ways in 2014, from 
recycling tires in Mexico to empowering students to speak 
out on environmental policy in Dubai, to helping women develop technical skills in Turkey. 
Cummins’ Corporate Responsibility 
value calls on the Company and its 
employees to “serve and improve  
the communities in which we live.”
Cummins has more than 200 
employee-led Community Involvement 
Teams (CITs) around the world that organize most of the Company’s 
community service work. Cummins 
encourages employees to focus on three global priority areas where they 
can add knowledge, skills and passion:
 »Education
 »Environment
 »Social justice / equality  
of opportunityThe Company believes building stronger communities ultimately builds 
stronger markets for its products. This 
philosophy dates back to visionary CEO J. Irwin Miller, who helped 
organize Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 
1963 March on Washington, D.C. (see Cummins history timeline, page 17).
The Every Employee Every Community 
(EEEC) program provides employees with at least four hours of Company  
time to engage in community service 
work. Established in 2005, EEEC continues to serve as a foundational 
building block for Cummins to  
achieve community impact. In 2014, more than 50,000 Company employees, joint-venture employees 
and Cummins contractors reported 
devoting some 364,000 hours to community involvement work as  
part of the EEEC program.
Participation in the EEEC program 
increased from 68 percent of eligible  
employees and contractors in 2013  
to 73 percent in 2014. Meanwhile, engagement in another of the 
Company’s major community 
involvement programs, the Environmental Challenge,  
increased by 18 percent in 2014 
compared to the previous year.The Company is keeping its EEEC 2015 goal at 70 percent participation 
so it can put more focus on improving  
the quality of that engagement. 
The Environmental Challenge was 
created in 2009 as part of the 
celebration of the Company’s 90th birthday. The Challenge is a friendly, 
global competition among community 
service projects with an environmental component. Project teams can win 
up to $10,000 from the Cummins 
Foundation for the charitable entity  or non-governmental organization  
of their choice.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY75
Education efforts connected to 
Cummins’ Environmental Challenge  
projects in 2014 reached  
250,000 adults and children.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINS
In addition to the increases in 
participation, the amount of greenhouse  
gas (GHG) removed as a result of the Environmental Challenge also rose from an estimated 19,000 metric tons 
in 2013, the previous record, to about 
23,700 metric tons in 2014 (page 77). 
“Community service initiatives, like  
the Environmental Challenge, create  
a global footprint that allows Cummins employees to use their skills to achieve 
impact and results,” said Gwen 
Langley, Cummins Director of Global Community Engagement. “These 
programs help us build stronger 
communities, and attract and retain  the kind of employees we need to 
succeed as a company.”Although Cummins’ current metrics 
focus on employee engagement 
through EEEC, the Company has 
challenged its leaders to establish more impactful goals and metrics by 
region that will both help focus and 
achieve greater impact from Cummins’ community involvement efforts.
“At Cummins, leaders can be one of 
the strongest enablers for encouraging employee engagement and driving 
impact in our communities,” said Mark 
Levett, Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and CEO of the 
Cummins Foundation. “In 2014,  
we saw an increase in leaders who were meaningfully engaged in policy  
 
 development, coalition building and  mobilizing their teams to address 
tough community issues.”
Overall, Levett said 2014 was a very 
successful year. 
“I think these (participation) numbers 
illustrate the value we put on growing employee engagement to help solve 
problems in our communities,” Levett 
said. “Our employees take our core value very seriously and understand 
that their work is never truly done.”

Donations from Cummins  
employees to the United Way in  North America also increased from 
about $2.8 million in 2013 to nearly 
$3.12 million in 2014.
The United Way’s mission is to improve 
lives by mobilizing communities to 
address their key concerns. The organization raises money to support 
community organizations and launches 
its own initiatives in areas such as education and social services.
Because Cummins matches the gifts 
made by its employees to the United Way, more than $6 million was donated 
to help communities in North America. 
Nearly 6,000 of the 12,000 eligible employees participated. Employees in 
Clovis, New Mexico; Elkhart, Indiana; 
and Miramar, Florida, had 100 percent participation rates.
Cummins has also launched matching-
gift programs over the past five years in China, India and parts of Asia-Pacific. 
These initiatives allow employees 
outside North America to also support local non-profits whose causes are 
meaningful to them.SIGNIFICANT PARTNERSHIPS
Cummins continued financial support 
for several significant partnerships in 2014-2015, addressing a range of 
community needs.
The Company, for example, supports 
the Cummins College of Engineering 
for Women in Pune and Nagpur, India, 
which serves women who have long been underrepresented in the field of 
engineering. Cummins also continues 
to support EARTH University in  Costa Rica, which teaches sustainable 
agriculture to students from around  
the world.

receive major grants from the 
Company or its foundations,  please go to page 89.
Looking ahead, Levett says while he 
was pleased with 2014, Cummins will continue to challenge its leaders and 
employees in 2015.
“Last year (2014) was a very good year 
for helping our Cummins communities 
grow stronger,” Levett said. “We feel 
that our continued focus on defining impact and related metrics will improve 
our communities that much more.”77
ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE  
ENJOYS ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL YEAR
For the sixth year in a row, Cummins employees 
demonstrated their passion for the environment through the 
Company’s Environmental Challenge. The numbers say it all.
More than 13,600 employees  
working on 62 teams in 17 countries 
removed an estimated 22,370 tons  
of greenhouse gases (GHGs), a  record amount equivalent to taking  
4,709 vehicles off the road each year 
or planting or saving 573,584 trees.Employees donated more than  63,000 hours, planted more than 
82,000 trees and diverted more than 
8,000 tons of garbage from landfills. About 55 percent of the Challenge 
projects had at least some educational 
component, reaching more than 250,000 children and adults. About 16 percent of the 2014 
Challenge projects involved water 
conservation or protection. Projects in the Challenge conserved or made 
fit for use about 3.6 billion gallons of 
water, enough to fill 5,500 Olympic- size swimming pools.
The Environmental Challenge is a 
friendly, global competition where Cummins employees take their 
skills into the community to address 
environmental problems. Community service projects are evaluated based 
on their level of employee engagement, 
environmental impact and ingenuity.
The winning projects, selected by a panel  
of experts, receive up to $10,000 each 
for the charitable or non-governmental organization of their choice. But the 
real winner is the environment.

component in their cook stove project in China to warn people about the dangers of indoor air pollution from inefficient cook stoves.PROJECTS BY REGION
In 2014, 62 teams from 17 countries  developed projects to improve the environment in their communities, including first-time entries from new participating locations, including 
Singapore and Dubai. Here’s a look at a

Here’s a closer look at three of the  
19 global project winners, each with  
a different focus either on waste,  
water or energy.
WASTE: 
BECOMING RESPONSIBLE  FOR THEIR TRASH
In La Pila, Mexico, it’s not uncommon 
to find trash littering the street, 
sidewalks and parks. On average, 
each resident of La Pila generates  800 grams of waste per day, of which 
at least 500 grams could be recycled. 
The Community Involvement 
Team (CIT) at Cummins Generator 
Technologies (CGT) in San Luis Potosí, 
Mexico, decided to use the 2014 Environmental Challenge as a way  to raise awareness about the benefits  of waste management and recycling  in nearby La Pila. 
CGT’s project, “Zero Waste Management,” 
established a framework for a public waste collection service and promoted 
waste responsibility through a public 
campaign called “I am responsible  for my waste.” 
“Many of La Pila’s residents weren’t 
committed to maintaining the health of their community, which is why our 
public campaign centered on individual 
responsibility,” said Cristina Nava, Corporate Responsibility Leader for 
Mexico and Cummins’ Central America 
Area Business Organization (ABO).
The project used a phased approach 
to address La Pila’s trash problem. 
First, an employee team established an educational model called  “Green Schools” in six schools in  La Pila. Shop-floor employees taught 
more than 2,000 students about the 
environment and helped them develop a system for separating waste into 
recycling stations at their school. 
Next, employees held an environmental 
fair and neighborhood cleanup to 
promote recycling in the community. 
Finally, employees helped set up a 
recycling program to reduce trash in 
La Pila. When the system is entirely in 
place, an estimated 74.7 tons of waste will be recycled each year. Because 
recycling reduces the demand for  
raw materials, the project will also  save an estimated 54,000 gallons  
of water and 130 metric tons of  
carbon dioxide (CO
2) per year. That’s 
the equivalent of removing 28 cars 
from the road or planting 3,367 trees.
The project’s community partner, 
SEGAM, the Department of Ecology 
and Environmental Management in  
San Luis Potosí, will maintain the recycling process to ensure the 
initiative is sustainable.The “Zero Waste Management”  
team has lofty goals for the program.  In 2015, it hopes to increase the 
number of families involved in the 
Green Schools program from 688  to 860 and spread the program from  
La Pila to surrounding communities.
WATER:  
EVERY DROP COUNTS IN NANDAL VILLAGE
Water is fundamental for health, 
sanitation, agriculture and economic 
prosperity, but just a few years ago, 
the people of Nandal village near the Cummins’ Megasite in Phaltan, India, 
did not have a reliable supply to live 
healthy, productive lives.
“Nandal is a drought-prone area and 
its people faced severe water scarcity,” 
The Cummins team takes a break from 
their efforts to help La Pila, Mexico, better manage its waste.
A new reservoir is helping India’s Nandal  village address its water scarcities.SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY79
said Soujanya Veguru, Corporate 
Responsibility Senior Specialist 
at Cummins India. “Villagers were 
dependent on regular water deliveries to meet day-to-day water needs.”
The dire community problem required 
an ambitious response. Three years later, a team of Cummins employees 
succeeded not only in improving 
access to water for the village, but also in completely off-setting the amount 
of water used by the Company’s own 
operations in the area (page 54).  The Megasite is home to several 
Cummins plants. 
More than 800 Cummins employees 
went to work installing rain harvesting 
systems, fixing leaks, implementing 
drip irrigation and building two dams to manage water for nine villages 
surrounding the Megasite. 
More than 30,000 students were 
educated about water pollution  
and water conservation practices, 
creating a ripple effect moving  beyond the classroom into homes  
and neighborhoods.
In partnership with community schools, 
local leaders and non-governmental organizations, the project conserved more than 21 million gallons of water, 
the equivalent of nearly 32 Olympic-
size pools. Tankers are no longer needed to supply water, reducing  
fuel and greenhouse gas emissions 
from the weekly truck deliveries.
For villagers, these improvements 
mean their basic drinking water 
and sanitation needs are now being addressed and water is available to 
support agriculture and livestock.
ENERGY:  
THE PERILS  OF INDOOR  AIR POLLUTION
Some 500,000 people die every year 
in rural China as a result of indoor air 
pollution. Many Chinese families burn 
coal inside their homes while cooking. The lack of ventilation has a significant 
impact on the air quality inside and 
outside of their kitchens.
Cummins employees leading an 
Environmental Challenge project in 
Yangquan, China, have worked for  two years to alleviate this problem by  
 installing cleaner, more efficient  cook stoves in 200 homes. 
“A cook stove not only improves the 
livelihoods of villagers, it also reduces 
carbon dioxide (CO
2) and particulate 
matter emissions that result from traditional cooking methods,” said 
Queenie Wang, the Project Leader  
for this Environmental Challenge 
winning project.
Modern cook stoves produce 
environmental benefits and families can 
save money, too. By using cornstalks 
instead of coal for cooking fuel in new, more efficient stoves, two metric tons 
of CO
2 are saved per family each year. 
Each family can also expect to save around 400 Renminbi (about $64). 
This project began in 2012 and 
leverages the technical knowledge  
 
 of Cummins employees and multiple community partners. The Global 
Environmental Institute (GEI), the  
China Alliance for Clean Stoves  (CACS) and the Beijing University 
School of Chemical Technology  
have been critical to ensuring the project’s success and sustainability.
The 120 Cummins Emission Solutions 
Community Involvement Team (CIT) members who worked on this effort 
don’t plan to stop. In 2015, Wang and 
her team have already initiated steps to install an additional 2,000 cook stoves 
in the neighboring county of Ruicheng.
Along with this planned expansion,  
CIT members are adding environmental 
education classes in 10 schools to  
the cook stove project. More than  500 students have already  
participated in these classes.

TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM INCREASES  
OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN IN TURKEY
There’s a growing gap between the increasingly technical 
jobs available at companies like Cummins and the number  
of people who have the skills to succeed in those jobs. 
Schools across the globe simply aren’t teaching the  skills employers need.
That’s why Cummins and the 
Cummins Foundation are investing 
in communities around the world 
through TEC: Technical Education for Communities, which targets the technical skills gap through local 
vocational education programs. 
TEC is built on a five-point educational 
framework. The standardized 
education program includes resources, processes and tools to help schools 
identify and supplement gaps in 
their existing programs, ensuring a global approach and allowing the 
implementation of TEC at any site. 
There are multiple successful pathways from technical education to good jobs.
 In 2014, a new TEC program 
focused on mechatronics launched 
in Izmir, Turkey. Mechatronics is a 
multidisciplinary field that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, telecommunications 
engineering, control engineering  
and computer engineering.
In TEC, Cummins seeks to partner  
in each school location with business, government and community 
organizations to increase access  
to good jobs and build a stronger and growing employment base in 
communities across the globe.
“The key to this program is 
collaboration at local schools  
 among employers that need a  
skilled workforce,” said Mary Titsworth Chandler, who leads Global Strategic 
Corporate Responsibility Programs  
for Cummins. 
“Education that addresses the skills 
gap certainly helps employers, but also 
improves the quality of life in Cummins communities because more people 
can access quality jobs with good 
wages,” Chandler said. “Ultimately, we are helping build stronger communities 
by building a locally capable and 
knowledgeable workforce.”
At each TEC school, students are 
taught skills that are needed in the 
local labor market. There are also opportunities for workplace learning 
such as apprenticeships, internships 
and job shadowing. The TEC program uses Cummins and local employer 
talent to teach classes, train teachers 
on new technology and mentor students during their studies. “Pairing students with experts working in their field of study makes the end result of this program more tangible,” 
Chandler said. 
The global TEC initiative has  
roots in Indiana (U.S.A.), where 
Cummins is headquartered.
“Cummins has invested for many years 
in community education programs 
where our employees live and work, 
including in Indiana, working on high-quality early childhood education, 
improved high school graduation 
rates and education leading to jobs,” Chandler said. “Education creates 
opportunity and that is really  
important to Cummins.” 
The work that Cummins has done 
close to home has allowed the 
Company to expand education programs to its communities  
around the world. One important  
part of the Turkey TEC program  has been recruiting women students.SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY83
“The number of female students  
in technical education is very low,”  
said Semih Gunes, the Higher 
Education Vocational School Manager at Ege University, a program partner 
and one of the oldest colleges in 
Turkey. “Through TEC, we can  support the development and 
employment of female students.”
With Cummins’ assistance, the Ege 
University TEC Mechatronics program 
was awarded a quota from the government stating that 50 percent of 
its students must be qualified females, 
the first of its kind in Turkey. 
“TEC holds great importance in  
training female students in Turkey  
to become qualified technical staff,” 
said Dr. Candeger Yilmaz, Ege University Rector. “Development of 
such cooperation is very important  
to improve the collaboration between the university and industry.”In Turkey, Cummins, Schneider Electric and local Turkish business 
partners support Ege University with 
scholarships for students, curriculum, teacher training, guidance counseling 
and equipment purchases.
“It’s great to see a coalition like this 
come together to address a critical 
need,” said Gilles Vermot Desroches, 
Senior VP Sustainability, Schneider Electric, and General Delegate of  
the Schneider Electric Foundation. “Global companies and organizations 
who understand that need have a  
key role to play in finding solutions –  
it helps our communities and our businesses to be successful.”
In addition to Turkey, TEC has  
school programs around the world. The coalition in Nigeria, which began 
in 2013, marked the first agreement 
between Cummins and other organizations to support the program, 
a model that has gained momentum  
at other global sites, including in  China and most recently in Turkey. 
TEC also has programs in India, 
Morocco and Saudi Arabia with plans to expand in 2015 into Australia and 
parts of South America. 
“Industry, government and civil society 
have a stake in global education,”  
said Mark Levett, Vice President  
of Corporate Responsibility and  CEO of the Cummins Foundation. 
“The coalition in Turkey provides skills 
training and access to good jobs for students, including underrepresented 
groups such as women.”

waste reduction has reached more than 
14,500 households, resulting in a 66 percent 
increase in waste segregation at the source.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINS
CUMMINS HELPS CITY GET WISE ABOUT WASTE
Civic authorities in Pune, India, are looking to a Cummins Corporate Responsibility  
initiative for help as they work to get the city’s trash problems under control. 
A rapidly growing industrial and 
educational hub that includes  
several Cummins facilities, Pune  
has a population of more than  3 million people that is straining  
the city’s infrastructure. Among its 
many challenges, the city is finding it difficult to keep pace with the 
increasing volume of trash.
 
 Until mid-2014, Pune collected and disposed garbage in a landfill close to 
the city. Then, with garbage volumes 
growing quickly, producing alarming levels of environmental pollution, 
residents near the landfill began  
to protest. 
Civic authorities are taking another  
look at their waste management 
model, evaluating the possibility  of no longer collecting wet garbage from households. That would leave  Pune residents with no option but to 
segregate their waste and build pits 
to convert wet garbage into compost. With over 1,600 tons of solid waste 
generated each day, the city has to  
do something. 
Cummins India’s “Zero Garbage 
Project” is one model being  
considered for reducing the  amount of trash in the city. The Company has been working on 
waste management issues in Pune 
since 2011. Employees won Cummins’ Environmental Challenge competition 
for extension of their Zero Garbage 
Project in 2013.
The Company has been partnering 
with the NGO (non-governmental 
organization) Janwani, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and 
a cooperative (SWaCH) made up 
Cummins employees raise awareness  
about the need to reduce the amount  of waste sent to a landfill outside Pune.SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY85
of low-income residents of the city 
who collect trash (wet and dry) from 
doorsteps for recycling. 
The Zero Garbage Project converts 
biodegradable waste into energy 
and facilitates the recycling of non-
biodegradable material. With the successful implementation of the 
project in the Katraj Ward and then  
the Baner-Balewadi Ward, which is near the Company’s India campus, 
civic authorities believe Cummins  
has a sustainable model that can  be replicated across the remaining  
46 wards of the city. 
The model has worked regardless 
of a ward’s demographics. The 
composition of income groups in the 
Katraj and Baner-Balewadi wards, for example, are diametrically opposed. 
The program engages Cummins 
employees in organized rallies and door-to-door campaigns to create 
a basic awareness about waste 
segregation. It also sets up meetings with various housing societies, 
encouraging households to restart 
existing pits available for decomposing wet waste so it can be safely used  
 as organic material. The initiative also 
provides training to the society staff on 
operating compost pits and converting 
wet waste into organic matter. 
Having gauged that the weakest  
link in the solid waste management 
process was unreliable push carts used by trash collectors, Cummins 
engineers designed a cost-effective, 
durable, user-friendly push cart  through a Community Impact Six 
Sigma project. Six Sigma is the  
data-based business problem- solving tool popular at Cummins.
They developed a low-cost push- 
cart using analysis led design, the same tool that product designers  
work with at Cummins. The cart 
is better ergonomically, improving conditions for the waste-collectors  
and simplifying the process.  
The design has been shared with officials at the PMC for replication 
across various wards in the city.
The program has reached out to  
over 14,500 households, leading  
to a 66 percent increase in waste 
segregation (separating dry and wet waste at the source). The treatment 
 of wet waste in local composting pits  
has increased by 400 percent to over 2.5 tons per day in the two wards. 
Meanwhile, 6.5 tons per day  
of garbage are being processed at a local biogas plant, which can then 
be converted into electricity using a 
Cummins generator set. The electricity is being used to power street lights.
Additionally, Cummins has sponsored 
the Nirmalya project, which uses an annual festival as a key opportunity 
to promote recycling. In continuation 
of the project in 2014, Cummins employees successfully prevented  
river pollution from the traditional 
immersion of idols and other offerings such as flowers, fruits, spices,  
honey, coconuts, etc. By immersing 
these offerings into tanks instead,  the material was collected and 
converted into 156 tons of compost. With the success of the Katraj and 
Baner-Balewadi models, Cummins is now ready with a holistically developed 
model that can be replicated across 
different demographics within the city. During 2014, 980 Cummins employees 
logged 4,388 hours completing this 
project, using their skills and passion  to make their communities better 
places to live. 
“In addressing a significant challenge 
plaguing the city of Pune, that of waste 
management, it is a tremendously 
rewarding experience to see how the skills of our employees can be 
leveraged in developing a change 
model for different demographics  of the city,” said S. Ravichandran, 
Head of Corporate Responsibility  
for Cummins India.
Cummins employees have worked with trash 
collectors who gather waste looking for recyclable items in the wards where the Company program has been implemented. SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY86
A project by two Cummins engineers  
found a way to modify school bus 
powertrain specifications to improve  
fuel efficiency by more than 10 percent.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINS
BUS PROJECT LOOKS  
TO HELP SCHOOLS  LOWER COSTS
Editor’s Note: Some of the best Corporate Responsibility  
projects come about when Cummins employees put their  
job skills to work to address a need. Here are two examples:
A community service project by two 
Cummins engineers to reduce an 
Indiana school district’s fuel costs 
could potentially help schools across the United States save money on 
transportation.
The project involved finding cost-
effective ways to modify the powertrain 
in buses operated by the school 
system in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.), to maximize fuel mileage without 
compromising performance or safety.
Research conducted at the Company’s 
test facilities and under real world 
driving conditions found certain 
modifications to the powertrain improved bus fuel efficiency by  
more than 10 percent.
“Our hope is that this project will allow 
the Bartholomew Consolidated School Corporation (BCSC) and potentially many other school systems throughout 
the country to decide if establishing 
a new bus spec or upfitting existing buses is right for them,” said Steve 
Bellinger, a Vehicle Integration Engineer 
at the Columbus Engine Plant (CEP) who worked on the initiative.
In buses, and most other vehicles, 
engine torque is transferred through the  
transmission and drive axle or axles to 
move the vehicle. Optimization  
of these components is critical to  maximizing the performance and  
fuel efficiency of any vehicle. 
The Community Impact Six Sigma 
project led by Bellinger and Mark 
Slaton, an Environmental Engineer 
at CEP , was some three years in the making and ultimately led to hardware and software changes on bus powertrains. Six Sigma is a data- based business problem-solving  
tool widely used at Cummins. 
The project included changes in 
the transmission shift schedule, the 
number of forward speeds and the  
rear axle ratio, which taken together enable a bus to operate more 
efficiently. The project also reduced  
the load on the engine when a bus  is at a full stop to save fuel.
The Six Sigma project was sponsored 
by Jeff Caldwell, who leads Cummins’ global van and pickup truck business 
and also serves as the Bartholomew 
Consolidated School Corporation’s Board President.Slaton and Bellinger also worked  with Allison Transmission and  chassis engineers from the school  
bus companies. BCSC officials  
have adopted the recommended changes on all new bus purchases.
“Cummins and BCSC have been 
working for a long time to make things better and this is just another example 
of that,” Steve Forster, BCSC fleet 
services manager, told The Columbus Republic newspaper.In Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.), Cummins’  
Steven Bellinger, second from left, and Mark Slaton, center, led a Six Sigma project to help school districts save money on transportation.  
They are joined by Jim Parker, Dixie Harris 
and Karen Wetherald with the Bartholomew Consolidated School Corporation. SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY87
SCHOOL CHILDREN IN INDIA BECOME  
‘SUPER HEROES’ FOR THE ENVIRONMENT  THROUGH EDUCATION PROJECT
To commemorate Cummins India’s 50th anniversary in 2012, 
Company employees launched a nationwide environmental 
education campaign called “Coach Them Young.” 
Some 75,000 children at 200 schools 
in 51 cities watched a video and 
pledged to be a “True Super Hero”  
by protecting their environment  from waste and pollution. 
In 2013, the team expanded the 
project and used the vast network  of the Distribution Business Unit to 
reach more than 200,000 students  
in 71 cities. It was an Environmental Challenge winner both years.But this initial impact was not enough. In fact, it was only the beginning.
“Coach Them Young,” the India Area 
Business Organization and Distribution Business Unit used new strategies and 
partners to reach 400,000 students  
in 80 cities with 518 employees contributing 2,400 hours. The project 
won Cummins’ Environmental  
Challenge again in 2014.
 The project team worked with iVolunteer, 
a social enterprise that promotes 
India’s social development by bringing volunteers and organizations together, 
to coordinate the 1,600 educational 
sessions at 700 schools. Active leadership engagement and partnering 
with joint ventures, dealers, suppliers 
and customers also led to the project’s expanded outreach.
In addition to gaining new partners,  
the program turned in a new direction. The focus in 2014 was on conservation 
of natural resources. Students were 
shown practical ways to do this, such as closing the tap while brushing their 
teeth. Even if just one in 10 children 
takes these simple steps, it results in an annual savings of 3.65 million liters  
 
  
 
 of water and 3.65 million kilowatt  
hours (kWh) of electricity.
Employees not only put their 
organizational and time management 
skills to work, but also leveraged 
principles more commonly associated with the business world.
“The first step in change management 
is always to educate,” said Karan  Madan, project leader. “School children  
are the ideal propagators as they are future torchbearers of the world and have significant capability to learn, 
adapt and implement.”
The hope is that students will not only 
take personal actions, but become 
brand ambassadors – super heroes –  
inspiring their families, friends and neighbors to join them. This is where 
the project team plans to take the 
project next. They also plan to focus on empowering teachers and principals.

CUMMINS’ ENGINE FOR GIVING BACK
For Cummins, the fuel for philanthropy is its people.  
Through their skills and passions, they drive the  
Company’s financial support to programs, partners  
and projects in our communities.
Since 2007, the catalyst for Cummins 
Corporate Responsibility—a Company 
core value—has been its Every 
Employee Every Community (EEEC) program. By encouraging employees 
to volunteer four or more of their work 
hours, Cummins enables its teams to leverage their interests and abilities in 
their local communities. And employees are acting on  
that opportunity. 
In 2014, Cummins’ global priority 
areas—education, the environment and social justice/equality of 
opportunity—received record-setting 
engagement from its employees.  EEEC reached 73 percent in 2014, 
compared with 67 percent in 2013. 
And in response to that growth  came increased financial support  
from the Company.
Last year, Cummins invested 
some $18.1 million in its Corporate 
Responsibility efforts, compared with 
$15.3 million in 2013. That support was prompted, and granted, based on 
where and how Cummins employees 
chose to engage through EEEC. 
 
 For example, winners of the Company’s 2014 Environmental Challenge each 
received a $10,000 grant to give to the non-profit or non-governmental 
organization (NGO) of their choice. 
In North Carolina (U.S.A.),  
employees worked to improve third-
grade reading levels and were granted 
$245,000 to further that initiative. And, in India, more than $39,000 was 
devoted to a team-led project with 
an area NGO focused on educating underserved tribal women.
Such financial support is made 
possible by the Cummins Foundation, one of the oldest corporate 
foundations in the United States. 
Combined with Cummins employees’ EEEC engagement, both comprise the 
engine that creates lasting impact in 
communities around the world. 
Just as Cummins employees dedicate 
themselves to producing only the 
best for their customers, so, too, do they commit their best to giving back 
to their communities. They are the 
philanthropic Power of Cummins.
Cummins employees clean a river bank  
along the Luojiagou, a stream running  through Chongqing, China.

CUMMINS REDOUBLES ITS HEALTH  
AND SAFETY EFFORTS IN 2015
Cummins recorded 
improvements in three key 
health and safety metrics 
in 2014, expanded critical programs and won one  
of the world’s most  
prestigious health, safety  and environmental awards.
The Company, though, also recorded 
an increase in its Major Injuries and 
Dangerous Occurrences (MIDO)  
Rate in 2014 and missed aggressive goals in two other focus areas.
“We made real progress in 
implementing our vision that all employees are responsible for  
health and safety, not just on the  
job but in all facets of their lives,”  said Stan Woszczynski, Cummins 
Chief Manufacturing Officer and

Cummins won the National Safety 
Council’s prestigious Robert W. 
Campbell award in 2014 for its health, 
safety and the environment initiatives.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINS
the Company leader who oversees 
health and safety. “However, we  
know when it comes to health and 
safety, our work is never done.”
Cummins won the prestigious Robert 
W. Campbell Award from the National 
Safety Council in 2014 (page 99). In a video message to Company 
employees, Chairman and CEO Tom 
Linebarger said he felt tremendous pride about winning the award and  
at the same time a sense of urgency  
to do even more about safety.
“I came away thinking to myself since 
safety is the primary duty of a leader… 
(a goal of) zero incidents is really the only ethically responsible position to 
take,” Linebarger said. 
The Company is using the Campbell 
Award as a starting point to redouble 
its health and safety efforts.
“In 2015, Cummins is raising the 
expectations for health and safety,” 
said Michelle Garner-Janna, Executive 
Director – Corporate Health and Safety. “Each of us must be actively engaged  
 in preventing injuries and promoting 
safe behavior.”
2014 RESULTS
In 2014, Cummins saw improvements 
in three key health and safety 
performance indicators:
 »A 5 percent reduction compared to 
2013 in the Company’s Incidence 
Rate, the relative number of 
recordable injuries and illnesses  per 100 employees.
 »A 5 percent reduction in Cummins’ Severity Case Rate, which is based on the number of injuries and 
illnesses resulting in lost work  
days per 100 employees.
 »A 13 percent drop in the Company’s 
Ergonomics Incidence Rate. 
Ergonomics has been a leading cause of injury at Cummins.
But while the ergonomic rate of 0.149 (ergonomic injuries per 100 employees) was significantly under the Company’s 
goal (0.160), results for the Incidence 
Rate (0.610) and Severity Case Rate (0.190) were over Cummins’ goals  
(0.580 and 0.160, respectively). Nevertheless, the 2014 results for 
Incidence Rate and Severity Case  
Rate were better than in 2013.
Meanwhile, the MIDO Rate in  
2014 was well above Cummins’  
goal (0.057 compared to 0.020). 
Dangerous occurrences included  a technician getting struck by a  
wind-blown door, another falling  
off the top step of a truck and an engine dropping when a lifting sling 
broke. The door and fall resulted in  
fractured wrists. Thankfully, no one was hurt by the falling engine.
“That underscores why you have  
to think about safety every time,”  said Cummins Occupational Safety 
Director Pramod Palat. “Sometimes 
the seemingly safest activities are  the ones that result in significant 
injuries. Safety has to be top of  
mind, all the time.” 
There were 279 lost work days in 
2014, 162 First Aid Incidents and sadly 
one work-related fatality at one of the Company’s joint ventures in China.
 KEY INITIATIVES
Health and Safety leaders expanded 
two initiatives in 2014 – the Driver 
Safety program and a program  called “Live It. Lead It.”
“Live It. Lead It.” is designed  
to strengthen leaders’ personal commitment to health and safety by 
asking them to share their personal 
experiences with workplace injuries. Participants shared incidents involving 
people they were supervising,  
family members and former colleagues.
Leaders in the “Live It. Lead It.” 
program are asked to consider every 
work station in their facilities and whether they would let their mother, 
father, daughter or son work at those 
stations. They are also asked to  create an action plan detailing how 
they will personally lead health and 
safety going forward.
The program has been very effective 
and safety leaders are working to 
expand it in 2015 to non-supervisors. Woszczynski, for example, makes it a 
point to discuss with employees the SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // HEALTH & SAFETYneed to get actively engaged in health 
and safety through “Live It. Lead It.” 
when he speaks before groups  
around the Company.
“We want everyone to make  
safety personal,” said Garner-Janna.  
“That’s why we believe many of the principles in ‘Live It. Lead It.’ apply  
to every employee.”
The program has been customized  
for all employees and is being 
deployed in 2015.
The health and safety team also 
expanded its global driver safety 
initiative, sponsoring a special Driver 
Safety Expo in addition to Driver  Safety Week in October 2014.  
The week includes a focus each day 
on key topics such as driver fatigue, rural driving, motorcycle driving, safety 
at intersections and driver attitude.
The Road Safety Expo was a new 
event held at the end of the week  
in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.),  
where attendees safely experienced  first-hand the dangers inherent in 
conditions such as distracted driving.A phased-in effort to identify and work 
with drivers considered to be most 
at risk of getting injured driving was 
expanded and the Company started driver safety initiatives with several joint 
ventures in South America and Nigeria, 
said Clint Wernimont, Corporate Road  
and Safety Project Leader. 
The health and safety team also 
continued its successful Ergonomics Cup, a competition encouraging 
employees to identify and fix 
ergonomic problems at Cummins sites around the world. And the Company 
re-introduced Cummins’ toolbox to 
prevent slips, trips and falls, another leading cause of injury at the Company.
Garner-Janna believes Cummins has 
laid a great foundation for a safe 2015.
“We must look out for the safety and 
well-being of not only ourselves, but 
every Cummins employee,” she said. “Every injury is preventable, and it’s  
up to each of us to lead by example.”

CUMMINS WINS PRESTIGIOUS  
HEALTH AND SAFETY AWARD
Health and safety is a job never done, but for a few hours  
on a September night in San Diego, California (U.S.A.),  
in 2014, Cummins’ health and safety team took a  
moment to celebrate its accomplishments.
The Company was named the  
winner of the 2014 Robert W. 
Campbell Award by the U.S.-based 
National Safety Council. The award was presented at the Council’s 
international Congress and Expo,  
the world’s largest gathering of  health and safety professionals.The prestigious honor goes to companies that have successfully 
integrated environmental, health 
and safety management with their business operations as a cornerstone 
of corporate excellence. Past winners 
include Dupont (2013), Firmenich  (2012), UTC Fire & Security (2011),   The Dow Chemical Co. (2010) and 
Schneider Electric North America (2009).
According to the Campbell Award’s 
executive review committee, two of 
the primary reasons Cummins scored 
highly is because its leaders commit  to safety through the Company’s  
“Live It. Lead It.” program and 
Cummins actively engages employees in meaningful and impactful projects  
in the places they live and work.
“Cummins is a true learning 
organization that continues to  
seek opportunities to strengthen its 
outstanding approach to safety, health and sustainability,” said Deborah A.P . 
Hersman, President and CEO of the 
National Safety Council. 
The Campbell Award is underwritten 
by the Exxon Mobil Corporation and  
 named for Robert W. Campbell, a safety pioneer and the first president  of the National Safety Council.
“The Campbell Award is terrific 
recognition for the Cummins employees who have made 
tremendous progress in health, safety 
and the environment at our Company,” said Michelle Garner-Janna, Executive 
Director – Corporate Health & Safety. 
Cummins Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer Tom Linebarger said 
he would like to see the Company use 
the award as a starting point to raise the bar on its initiatives in health,  
safety and the environment. 
“Our work in safety is about caring for 
our people who work every day to help 
our Company succeed,” Linebarger 
said. “…There is much more to do and we will continue to be guided by our 
Company’s mission to demand that 
everything we do leads to a cleaner, healthier and safer environment.”Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger 
accepts the Robert W. Campbell Award at  the National Safety Council’s international Congress and Expo in San Diego.
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // HEALTH & SAFETY100SAFETY AT CUMMINS IS  
PART OF EVERYONE’S JOB
Cummins Director of Global Manufacturing Engineering  
Jim Schoeberl remembers vividly the day he walked on  
a shop floor and an employee stopped him, pointing out  
he was violating safety rules by wearing a ring.
Schoeberl wasn’t embarrassed. In fact, 
he couldn’t have been more pleased.
“I told him how much I appreciated 
what he had done,” Schoeberl said.  “I had just forgotten to take my ring off. We all have to look out for each other.”
When Schoeberl was asked to lead  
the global roll out of a new toolkit 
devoted to machine guarding safety, 
he didn’t hesitate. He’s the first Cummins leader outside the safety 
organization to take ownership of a 
global safety initiative, but he sees it  as a logical extension of his work.
“I’m not doing anything special,” said 
the 28-year veteran of the Company. “This is all of our jobs. Many of our  manufacturing leaders have  taken a very active role in safety  
initiatives within their businesses.  
This is just following their lead.”
Machine guards are anything that 
protects an employee from a hazard  
while operating a machine. They 
can range from a transparent shield 
protecting a worker from a lathe to 
“presence-sensing devices” that automatically shut down machines 
when any part of a worker strays  
into dangerous space.
Schoeberl was the sponsor of a  
Six Sigma project led by Guillermo 
Castillo, the then Corporate Safety Project Manager, looking at what 
seemed like a high number of injuries   
Cummins Director of Global Manufacturing 
Engineering Jim Schoeberl is leading Cummins’ efforts to improve machine guarding safety.
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // HEALTH & SAFETY101
related to machine guarding or the  
lack of adequate guards. Six Sigma  
is the data-driven problem-solving  
tool widely used at Cummins. 
When Castillo moved to another 
position within the Company, 
Schoeberl said it made sense  for him to take over responsibility  
for the initiative.
“When you think about it, machine 
guarding safety is something that  
my function owns,” he said.  
“It just makes sense.”
Schoeberl leads a global team 
of manufacturing engineers with 
representatives in every business unit and sub-business unit. He was ideally 
positioned to roll out the toolkit and 
make sure the work got done.
Machine guarding safety covers  
a very broad area and there wasn’t  
a single factor driving the problem.  In a few cases, guards were pushed 
aside to make work easier; in others,  
  the guards were forgotten after maintenance was performed.  
The problem also stemmed from 
the use of older equipment with inadequate guarding.
Tremendous strides have been made 
in modern equipment including safety features like “presence-sensing” 
technology or “light curtains” capable  
of shutting a machine down when it determines potentially dangerous 
behavior is taking place.
Cummins had sent out directives 
on machine guarding safety, but 
leaders decided to go the next step 
by developing a policy on the topic, drawing on national and international 
standards. Then, the Company 
developed the toolkit, including:
 »A risk assessment tool
 »A checklist to determine  proper machine guarding
 »An implementation plan to  
improve machine safeguarding
 »Training on the topicSchoeberl said some fixes are as 
simple as installing some sheet metal 
while others are more complicated,  
involving movable or fixed barriers  and the presence-sensing technology.  
Most new equipment includes the  latest safety devices but there are retrofits available, too.
The machine guarding toolkit calls 
for implementing improvements over three phases starting in 2015 through 
installation of new safeguards in 2017. 
Schoeberl has been pleased that many Cummins locations are implementing 
additional safeguards right away after 
determining their risks.
Pramod Palat, Cummins Occupational 
Safety Director, says Schoeberl’s 
involvement is consistent with the Company’s “Live It. Lead It.” initiative. 
Launched in 2013, the program is  
  designed to strengthen leaders’  personal commitment to health and 
safety to help drive employee behavior.
“Jim’s role in leading this initiative 
globally drives home the message that 
safety is a value for Cummins at every 
level of the Company,” Palat said.
Safety is something Schoeberl  
takes very personally. He started  
as a maintenance engineer at the  Rocky Mount Engine Plant in Rocky 
Mount, North Carolina (U.S.A.), in 
1987. As far as he’s concerned, he’s seen too many injuries over his career.
“I’ve taken more than one maintenance 
technician to the hospital, personally,” Schoeberl said. “It’s very heartrending 
to see someone get hurt. You become 
very aware, very conscious of safety. You never look the other way.”“I’ve taken more than one maintenance technician to the

‘KNIGHT KNUCKLE’ INVENTOR  
CREATES A SAFER CUMMINS 
When Jamestown Engine Plant tool builder Kendrick Knight 
came up with the idea for a device to improve ergonomics 
at his workplace, he did not foresee the impact his torque-
reducing invention would have.In the past year, his creation has gone 
from blueprint to patent-pending 
reality. Dubbed the “Knight Knuckle,” 
it has improved ergonomics for engine assembly workers, earned international 
recognition and has garnered interest 
from Cummins sites and outside companies alike.
“I can’t believe how well this project 
has been received,” said Knight, who has worked at the Cummins plant in Jamestown, New York (U.S.A.), for the 
past two years. “The level of press and 
enthusiasm is really exciting, and it’s 
great to think of this tool being used at 
Cummins manufacturing sites all over the world.”
Knight worked in a manufacturing tool 
room for five years prior to joining the Company. He realized the need for a 
new tool when he saw his colleagues 
at Cummins working on jobs that   
 had a “kick” of torque due to their 
use of high-torque tools. Any time a 
bolt or screw is tightened, the tool 
creates torque once the screw reaches full tightness. The torque is then 
transferred directly to the operator. 
Imagine a hand-held power drill for 
home use. The drill is easy to hold 
when the task begins, but starts to 
push back against the operator’s arm as the screw becomes tighter – or fully torqued – in the wall. High-torque tools 
are similar, but on a much larger scale 
and with a much larger impact on the 
operator’s body.
“We have a lot of applications  
with high-torque tools,” Knight said.  
“These tools take a significant amount 
of time to use, and the process is  hard on the employee. I saw the  
idea of the Knuckle as a way to solve 
multiple problems with one new tool.” 
 
Cummins tool builder Kendrick Knight  
displays his invention, the “Knight Knuckle.”
103
The Knight Knuckle took first place in the  
engineering category at the International Ergo Cup 
competition in Nashville, Tennessee (U.S.A.).
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINS
Kendrick’s invention replaces a  
typical torque arm tool and allows  
the operator to work from any angle.  
In contrast to older torque arm tools that have very limited positioning,  
the possibilities for usage are  
greatly increased. Once positioned, the tool locks in place, so when the 
“kick” occurs, the Knuckle absorbs 
it, virtually eliminating the transfer of torque to the employee. The tool 
was conceptualized, designed and 
fabricated in Jamestown.
The implementation of the Knight 
Knuckle has significantly reduced ergonomic risk to the operator during 
high-torque jobs. In addition to 
reduced strain, the Knight Knuckle 
shaved eight seconds off the time it takes to complete the job; over the 
course of a full day, the tool saves 
approximately 45 minutes. The tool is also durable, having been run through 
thousands of test cycles without 
breaking down or failing. 
The Knight Knuckle won top honors  
in the Company’s third annual Ergo 
Cup competition. Previous first  place honors went to a part installation 
improvement process from Jamestown in 2013 and a power generation 
hoist improvement from one of the 
Company’s joint ventures in China. 
Out of a record 90 project submissions 
in 2014 – all dedicated to making 
ergonomic improvements in the 
workplace – the Knight Knuckle earned the right to compete in the International 
Ergo Cup competition at the Applied 
Ergonomics Conference in Nashville, Tennessee (U.S.A.). Other companies 
participating in the 2015 International 
Ergo Cup competition included Volkswagen, Ford, Honda,  
Gulfstream, Boeing and Caterpillar.
The Knight Knuckle took first place in 
the engineering category and garnered 
interest from outside manufacturing 
companies. The tool will be deployed at multiple Cummins sites in 2015. 
 
 “Kendrick’s project reinforces that Cummins has incredibly innovative 
employees,” said Chris Shieldsmith, 
the Company’s Corporate Ergonomics Specialist. “He devised a simple 
solution to a problem that has plagued 
manufacturing for decades and we’re very proud of his accomplishment.”
In the face of so much acclaim,  
Knight is still focused on one thing:  the improvements his tool has  
made in the lives of other 
manufacturing employees.
“This has increased tool mobility, 
improved their level of comfort  
and generated a lot of excitement,” he said. “People have started asking 
me to think of new solutions to their 
work problems. It’s exciting to think of creating more tools and the potential 
they have to help employees.”
“I’m very pleased to see projects that have a  
real, positive impact on our employees’ lives.  
This innovation from our manufacturing  
employees deserves to be recognized.”

CUMMINS STRENGTHENS  
DIVERSITY VALUE IN 2014
Diversity is a core value at Cummins, which calls for its 
employees to embrace the diverse perspectives of all  
people, honoring them with dignity and respect.
In 2014, the Company took steps to deepen its commitment to that  
value, while at the same time re-examining many of its diversity initiatives  
to ensure they remain relevant at a growing company where more than  
60 percent of its employees live outside the United States.
“We really want to see how we can better work with Cummins Area Business 
Organizations (ABOs) around the world to ensure the power of diversity is  
part of everything we do,” said Kelley Bertoux Creveling, the Company’s  Executive Director of Global Diversity and Right Environment. “In addition  
to helping us create innovative products, diversity and inclusion are critical  
to establishing a solid foundation for future growth and success that will  better serve our customers.”
  RENEWING OUR COMMITMENT
Cummins’ commitment to diversity 
could be seen in many ways during 2014 and early 2015. The Indiana 
Women’s Affinity Group at the 
Company, for example, sponsored a special session for managers to talk 
about the Company’s diversity value 
and the issue of gender diversity in the workplace (to learn more about Cummins’ efforts on gender diversity, 
go to page 106). 
The event, which featured many top 
leaders in the Company, was streamed 
live to managers at Cummins facilities 
in the United States, Mexico and the United Kingdom.
“We’re here to get better,” said 
Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger at the event. “None of us  are perfect at managing diversity.  None of us are perfect at really any 
element of leadership and the first 
minute we acknowledge that and  say we want to get better, we’re  
on the road to greatness.”
The Company also continued  
posting personal statements from its 
leaders regarding their own diversity 
journeys on the Company’s internal website. In 2014, Rich Freeland, 
Cummins President and Chief 
Operating Officer; John Wall, the Company’s Vice President – Chief 
Technical Officer and Mark Osowick, 
the Company’s Vice President – Human Resources Operations,  
all posted personal statements.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom 
Linebarger holds his annual diversity town  hall meeting at the Columbus Engine Plant  in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.).
RIGHT ENVIRONMENT105
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // RIGHT ENVIRONMENT // DIVERSITY
A dozen leaders have now posted 
diversity statements since Linebarger 
kicked off the initiative in January 2013.
“I can’t think of a single time when 
diversity didn’t contribute to the  
success of a project I’ve been involved  
with in my more than 28 years at 
Cummins,” Wall said in his statement. 
“Different life experiences and unique 
sets of knowledge all add up to team members who can best understand 
our customers’ experiences and see 
different angles on how to target our innovation more effectively.”
The Company built on the diversity 
statements by leaders in 2014 by  also asking for diversity statements 
from employees on their personal 
diversity journeys at work (see more  
on page 109).
“Through diversity, we can succeed and reach the topmost level,” said Sagarika Dash, Account Specialist – 
Telecom, in Pune, India. “Look at  
your present environment and you  will definitely find one instance of 
diversity enhancing our path to 
success. Every employee should  get a chance to work in such a  
 collaborative place as Cummins and 
get a chance to explore their ideas.”
The Company also continued 
developing its employee resource groups. Cummins has more than  
100 employee groups organized 
around diversity. Affinity groups are employee formed and led, organized 
around specific demographic traits 
such as women, African-Americans  or LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual  
and transgender). Local Diversity 
Councils are site-based groups that are Company formed and leader led, 
promoting diversity and inclusion in 
general and working on diversity-related issues at particular sites.
Finally, Linebarger held a focus group 
with Muslim employees early in 2015 to better understand their experiences 
and hear their views on how Muslims 
are portrayed in the news and other public media. Linebarger also 
reiterated that Cummins is a safe and 
welcoming place for all employees  in keeping with the Company’s  
core values. Linebarger’s discussion 
was prompted by his concern over growing anti-Muslim rhetoric in the  
 
 media and public debate amid  growing tensions in the Middle East.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
While Cummins took many steps to 
increase its commitment to diversity 
and inclusion, Creveling and her staff 
also spent time in 2014 and early  2015 looking to the future.
The group wanted to make sure  
the Company’s five-year-old diversity video and its diversity literature still 
resonated with employees. The group 
also embarked on a project to update and expand diversity training from its 
current status as a one-time training at 
the start of an employee’s career to a layered approach that stretches across 
an employee’s time at Cummins. 
“We recognize the approach to 
diversity and inclusion may need to 
change from country to country,” 
Creveling said. “I want to be sure we’re building strategies and plans 
around diversity and inclusion in ways 
that support our common value but allow us to flex around the world and 
leverage the full, creative power of 
all our employees to the benefit of our customers looking for innovative 
solutions to their power problems.”INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS
A key part of any company’s efforts 
to create the right environment for 
success is the ability to investigate complaints made about employees’ 
treatment of each other.
Cummins’ diversity value is 
included in the Company’s Code 
of Conduct. The Company has 
Master Investigators stationed around the world to investigate 
reported abuses of the Code. 
Employees can file complaints anonymously where allowed by law.
As a growing Company, Cummins 
saw an increase in complaints in 2014. The Company investigated 
1,559 reported Code violations,  
up from 1,367 in 2013. About  45 percent of those reports  
came from outside the United 
States and 32 percent were reported anonymously.
About 48 percent of the  
total reports were ultimately 
substantiated in 2014, compared 
to 50 percent in 2013. Around 
29 percent of the substantiated reports resulted in terminations 
compared to 33 percent in 2013.
The average time to close  
a case was 13 work days,  
down one day from 2013.106
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // RIGHT ENVIRONMENT // DIVERSITY
DIVERSITY HELPS  
SOLVE HARD PROBLEMS
Opening doors for women begins with an open dialogue  
and a commitment to workforce inclusion.
“When we do something that helps 
us create the right environment 
for women, everybody benefits,” 
Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger told more than 1,000 managers at 
Cummins attending a panel discussion 
on gender diversity in October 2014. 
“It’s not an us vs. them thing,” he said. 
“It’s us and us.”
Cummins is making progress in its efforts 
to attract and develop women, but 
leaders say more can and must be done.
In 2014, women made up about 
26 percent of the Company’s total 
workforce and about 20 percent of the 
Company’s leadership ranks. In 2009, women made up about 24 percent  
of the total workforce and about  
16 percent of its leadership ranks.
Evidence of the Company’s progress 
could be seen at that same panel discussion where Linebarger  
spoke. Joining him on the panel  
were three senior women leaders:  
Jill Cook, Cummins Vice President of Human Resources; Tracy Embree, 
Vice President and President of the 
Components Business Unit and  Kelley Bertoux Creveling, Executive Director of Global Diversity and  
Right Environment.
The panel discussion was sponsored 
by the Women’s Affinity Group of 
Indiana, one of the Company’s more than 100 employee groups organized 
around different facets of diversity.
Affinity Groups provide support and 
networking opportunities for their 
members in addition to representing 
the group’s views to senior leaders and helping solve business problems. 
Local Diversity Councils are site-
based groups that promote diversity in general and identify diversity-related issues at particular sites.
The Women’s Affinity Group of Indiana 
has long offered career development programming to its members, such 
as mentoring circles, seminars by 
Cummins leaders and other career enhancement activities. It is one of 
more than 30 women’s affinity groups 
at the Company based at locations around the world.
Cummins has also initiated  
recruiting programs, especially in areas like engineering where women 
have long been under-represented. 
For example, the Company has been a major contributor to the Cummins 
College of Engineering for Women  
in Pune and Nagpur, India. Cummins India also sponsors a week of activities 
dedicated to women in recognition  
of International Women’s Day on  March 8. This year’s theme was  
“Make It Happen.”
In 2014, the Company launched the 
Technical Women Initiative to help hire, 
develop and retain women in technical 
fields as part of a broader corporate commitment to diversity.WORKING FOR A WELCOMING STATE
For a second consecutive year, Cummins 
found itself lobbying against legislation that 
sent a less than welcoming message about  its home state of Indiana (U.S.A.).
Senate Bill 101 in the Indiana Legislature was 
intended to increase legal protections for those  
with strongly held religious beliefs, but several  
businesses and advocacy groups were 
concerned the bill could be used to refuse services to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and 
transgender (LGBT) individuals.
Cummins, the Indianapolis Chamber of 
Commerce and other businesses opposed the  
bill because they said it sent an unwelcoming message and could expose businesses to lawsuits over religious belief claims that existing 
law already protects. The bill was amended to 
prevent business litigation concerns, but still did not expressly state it could not be used  
to deny services.
A media firestorm ensued throughout  
the United States. Cummins, along with 
several members of the business and LGBT 
communities, worked to include language that expressly disallows the use of the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act to discriminate on the 
basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
The previous year, Cummins opposed a bill that 
would have banned gay marriage in Indiana’s 
constitution. The Company maintained it would make it harder to recruit the best employees 
who often look for diverse places to live. 
That bill was not brought up for a final vote.107
As part of the Technical Women’s 
Initiative, Cummins has been active 
in the Clean Energy Education & 
Empowerment (C3E) initiative.  C3E was launched by the 
23-government Clean Energy 
Ministerial in 2010. The Initiative  was born out of recognition that  
the ideas and talents of all members  
of society are essential to meeting future clean energy challenges.
Since then, the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology (MIT) has been the leading institution backing 
the group in the United States and 
Cummins has been a corporate sponsor. Starting in 2012, annual 
symposiums at MIT have provided 
women working in clean energy  with a range of perspectives  
and expertise on clean energy  
challenges and opportunities,  as well as a chance to network.Jennifer Rumsey, Cummins Vice President – Engineering, Engine 
Business, and Joan Wills, the 
Company’s High-Horsepower Chief Engineer and Program Leader for 
Tier 4, represented Cummins at the 
inaugural symposium, where Rumsey spoke as part of a panel discussion 
on the topic of “Mobilizing Change in 
the Private Sector.” Hélène Cornils, Engineering Director of Global Lab 
Operations, has also represented 
Cummins at C3E events.
Wills currently serves as one of  
37 international C3E Ambassadors, 
executive-level leaders who work together to advance women’s 
participation and leadership in  
the sector.
“The group has a variety of educational 
backgrounds but share a common link 
of being female leaders working in   their area of expertise to both  expand the role of clean energy in our 
collective future as well as increase 
the representation of women in the field,” Wills said. “As an ambassador, 
I’m responsible for leading and 
participating locally, nationally and globally in efforts to increase the 
representation of women in the  
field of clean energy.” 
Dr. John Wall, Cummins Vice  
President and Chief Technical Officer, 
said the Technical Women’s Initiative and groups like C3E are important  
for several reasons.
“Cummins supports and engages  
in the C3E Symposium because  
it’s important to endorse women  
in the area of clean energy and in  the technical function,” Wall said.
 
 “Participation in and our support of  the conference promotes our diversity 
core value and helps us create an 
inclusive environment by allowing our technical women to share their 
knowledge and learn from other 
women in the same field,” he said.
Linebarger says a successful 
workplace depends on a pipeline  
of female leaders who are ready  and encouraged to move up  
within the Company.
“Diversity, rather than sameness, 
is what helps us solve complex 
problems,” Linebarger said.  
“There’s a lot of research about this that’s pretty compelling. My personal 
experience agrees with it. Sameness 
drives harmony, especially at the front, and diversity solves hard problems.”

DEVELOPING A TRULY GLOBAL WORKFORCE
Diversity at Cummins has long been about more than representation. But as a truly  
global company, Cummins wants to develop a workforce that closely resembles the  
demographics in the countries and markets where it does business.
Company leaders pay special attention to some key metrics of under-represented  
groups at Cummins, such as women. An employee’s country of birth is another  
key metric to ensure leadership isn’t limited to one country or group of countries.  
Here’s a look at what’s been happening in these areas from 2008 to 2014.

“Approximately two years ago, my team and I were 
working on the delivery of our first machine to a key 
customer. We were at risk to deliver late and we had 
only one chance to make a good first impression. 
I went down to the workshop to see how things 
were progressing. I witnessed Rauf from Pakistan, 
Tanmay from India and Dhanushka from Sri Lanka 
all working together, helping each other to make 
sure we could deliver on time to our customer. 
We were a small team and everybody worked well 
together across functional boundaries – there was 
no direct managerial direction. A job had to be  
done and the team just got on and did it.
…Looking back in history, their countries have  
been fraught with political and diplomatic issues; 
yet, these three individuals put their respective 
strengths together to make sure we, and our 
customer, were successful.”“When I was assigned to the Power Electronics 
organization within PGBU-India, my teammates 
included people from all over India – North, South 
and West. The more I worked with them, the  
more I came to know their nature, their work 
approach, the different mindsets of each  
person and the diversity in perceptions. 
All of these experiences taught me the  
quality of the meaning of diversity. It made  
me believe that, through diversity, we can  
succeed and reach the topmost level. Look at  
your present environment and you will definitely  
find one instance of diversity enhancing our  
path to success. Every employee should get a 
chance to work in such a collaborative place as 
Cummins and get a chance to explore their ideas.”DIVERSITY AT WORK
To help promote Cummins’ diversity value, the Company collected personal  
diversity stories from employees around the world. Here are excerpts from three:
SAGARIKA DASH
Accounts Specialist – Telecom

“Working for Cummins I had to expand my 
knowledge, understand that change was inevitable 
and that I could grow from it rather than fear it. I 
needed to depend on the strengths and support of 
co-workers to accomplish the goal. 
In 2005, I took a role in the engineering function 
where the window was opened even wider. 
Although I haven’t had the opportunity to travel 
outside the U.S. for work, I have had the pleasure  
of working with many people throughout the world –  
through the phone, email and video conferencing. 
Many of my co-workers grew up in other countries, 
and through conversation and pictures I’m able to 
hear about and see their life experiences to better 
understand diverse views and beliefs. 
When I think back to my younger days on the farm, 
my view of the world was so narrow and I felt that 
most of the world lived like me. 
Today, I have a connection to 
many parts of the world 
through my co-workers 
and I find strength in 
being part of a  
global team.”

DIVERSITY PROCUREMENT  
CELEBRATES OUTSTANDING YEAR
Cummins’ diversity procurement initiative reached its  
long-standing goal of $1 billion in spending with diverse 
suppliers across eight categories in 2014, and laid the 
foundation for future growth.
Spending with diverse suppliers  
in 2014 reached $1.2 billion in the 
U.S., up about 21 percent over the 
$990 million spent in 2013. Looking just at minority-owned and women-
owned businesses, the Company 
spent about $926 million in 2014.
Meanwhile, Cummins’ efforts continued 
to show promise outside the United 
States. Diverse spend connected to Cummins Area Business Organizations 
(ABOs) reached $291.3 million, 
sending global spend with diverse suppliers to nearly $1.5 billion. 
“We had a very good year in  
terms of raising the visibility of diversity procurement at Cummins,” 
said Michelle Taylor, the Company’s 
Diversity Procurement Director.  “Now we need to leverage diverse suppliers in areas where historically 
Cummins has not had diverse supplier 
exposure. This effort will lead to sustainability within the initiative  
and further supply chain excellence.”
Cummins has long had a robust  
focus on diversity procurement.  
By working with diverse suppliers,  
the Company increases competition for its business, which ultimately 
decreases costs and improves 
service. At the same time, diversity procurement develops economic 
growth in all of the communities where 
Cummins employees live and work.
 
 
 COMMUNICATIONS
The Company made communicating 
with diverse suppliers a top priority in 2014, launching several different 
initiatives to address that over the 
course of the year.
A new website is designed to make 
it easier for diverse suppliers to learn 
about the opportunities at Cummins. It includes a video featuring Taylor and Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger discussing Cummins’ desire to promote diversity procurement.
“The need for diversity is really a 
priority at every level of the company,” Linebarger says on the video, 
Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger 
talks to Cathy Langham, President and CEO of Langham Logistics, at a symposium on diversity procurement sponsored by the Company.111
Cummins’ spending with  
diverse suppliers has more  
than doubled since 2009.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINS
adding that diversity brings different 
perspectives, which can contribute  
to creative solutions that are good  
for the Company and its customers.
Taylor said having Linebarger part 
of the video sends an important 
message, showing suppliers that  the Company’s top leadership is 
serious about diversity procurement.
The website also tells prospective 
diverse businesses how to work with 
Cummins. The Company works with 
diverse suppliers in eight categories – minority business enterprises, women 
business enterprises, service disabled 
veteran owned small businesses, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender 
owned businesses; historically under-
utilized business zone businesses; small disadvantaged businesses  
and philanthropic enterprises.
The website includes the stories 
behind diverse suppliers Cummins  
is already working with to give  
visitors examples they can study. And a newsletter keeps the supplier 
diversity community informed about 
the latest happenings at the Company.SYMPOSIUM
Cummins in 2014 also sponsored its 
first diversity procurement symposium 
since 2006. The event drew some  400 participants including many people 
in the Company’s purchasing function 
who got a chance to meet and talk to diverse suppliers.
Linebarger spoke at the event as well 
as Lisa Yoder, Vice President – Global Supply Chain and Manufacturing, and 
Timothy Millwood, Vice President – 
Purchasing. More than 70 potential suppliers who were not doing  
business with Cummins then  
had booths as part of the event.
“Our leaders talked about the 
importance of supplier diversity and 
then many of our purchasing staff had a chance to meet diverse suppliers 
so it was a great day for diversity 
procurement,” Taylor said.
Several Cummins supply chain leaders 
also showed their commitment to 
diversity procurement by attending the National Minority Supplier Development 
Council’s National Conference in 2014 in Orlando, Florida, and Millwood 
serves on the Board of the Mid-States 
Minority Supplier Development Council 
(MSDC), which covers Central Illinois, Indiana and Eastern Missouri.
ACHIEVEMENTS
The diversity procurement team made 
progress on its goal of taking diversity 
procurement outside the United States.
In addition to seeing diverse spending 
connected with the Area Business 
Organizations increase to nearly 
$300,000, Cummins was named Minority Supplier Development 
Council for the U.K.’s Corporation of 
the Year for its leadership in diversity procurement in the United Kingdom.
That was not the only award Cummins 
won in 2014. The Company was also named 2014 Mid-States MSDC 
Corporation of the Year for its diversity 
procurement efforts in the United States. It was the second year in  
a row that Cummins won that honor. Spending on diverse suppliers

CUMMINS ‘HIRE TO DEVELOP’ 
PHILOSOPHY
Employee development at Cummins starts with Global 
OnBoarding and continues through a host of learning 
opportunities with a special emphasis on leadership.
The Company believes leadership  
is critical to Cummins’ future and 
works to develop leadership skills  
at every level of the Company. Cummins believes all employees 
provide leadership whether or  
not they have employees  reporting to them.
This approach to employee 
development is a key part of  the Company’s efforts to make 
Cummins a great place to work.
A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT
Most employees get a full week of  
onboarding to learn about Cummins’ 
culture and foundational initiatives  such as the Company’s Code of 
Conduct; Vision, Mission and  
Values and key initiatives such  as Customer Support Excellence.After that, there are a host of development opportunities for 
employees not only so they can  
master their current jobs but look ahead to their next positions  
at the Company.
These opportunities range from 
courses on managing direct reports for 
a population of 5,000 leaders globally 
to master’s in business administration (MBA) classes for annual cohorts of  
30 people offered in collaboration 
with the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University in the United States.
Cummins also offers ex-patriate 
assignments so high-performing employees can get experience in 
different countries and rotational 
assignments so they can gain experience in different operations 
within the Company.In addition, Cummins Learning  Center offers numerous online  
learning opportunities in multiple languages both in and out of an 
employee’s particular area of expertise. 
These range from courses within engineering to courses on the  
business problem-solving tool Six 
Sigma and courses in leadership.
CRITICAL FEEDBACK
New office and professional Cummins 
employees are introduced to the Company’s Performance Management 
System during onboarding classes. 
The program was created to ensure employees know their managers’ 
expectations, including both what  
they need to accomplish and how  they should accomplish it. 
It uses a web-based tool to facilitate 
and document the most important part of performance management – 
meaningful one-on-one conversations 
between a manager and his or her direct reports. Employees also get EMPLOYMENT BY THE NUMBERS
Here’s a quick look at Cummins’  
workforce in 2014.

feedback from a wide range of 
stakeholders including peers, which 
becomes increasingly important  
as they advance and their work environment becomes more complex.
With more than half of Cummins’ 
employees living outside the United States, the Company takes a global 
view of workforce development.  
The Performance Management  system is available in multiple 
languages for about 25,000 office  
and professional employees.
LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
Cummins believes nothing is  
as career limiting as a bad boss  and work that is without meaning.  
Leaders and managers learn early  
on that they must master five skill  areas that Cummins believes are 
essential to great leadership:
 »How to coach and develop
 »Fostering open communications
 »Managing diversity
 »Talent management
 »Thinking strategically /  Setting the aimOne of Cummins’ most successful programs has been the “Building 
Success in Others” initiative. Launched in 2011, this multi-component program 
includes web-based courses, live 
webinars and an intensive, three-and-a-half day course focused primarily on helping leaders of professional 
employees better understand the 
Company’s expectations for them as leaders and how to develop the skills 
necessary to fulfill those expectations.
The program has now been 
implemented in China, India, 
Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, 
the United Kingdom and the United States and the Company is looking for 
ways to extend its concepts to others. 
The Global Leadership Development 
Program is another important 
leadership development initiative.  The 18-month program prepares  
about 20 high-potential employees 
from within one specific Area  
Business Organization at the  Company for global leadership roles.
This program plays a major role in 
developing future leaders from outside the United States. It wrapped up in 
South America and Africa in 2014  
and is moving back to India and  China in 2015.
In all these ways and others, Cummins 
promotes a culture of career-long learning and development so all 
employees can achieve satisfaction in 
their work and reach their career goals.COMPENSATION / BENEFITS
Providing a competitive 
compensation and benefits 
package is important at Cummins.
The health and well-being of the 
Company’s employees is a priority 
at all global locations and Cummins has developed programs tailored  
to meet the needs of employees 
and their families.
Compensation, health and 
retirement benefits vary by  
location and are designed to be competitive within the local markets 
and countries where the Company 
does business. Cummins complies with the law everywhere and 
establishes market-based wages 
independent of a person’s gender or any other demographic trait. 
Cummins takes an innovative 
approach in its benefits programs. In healthcare, the Company has 
hired a chief medical officer to help 
Cummins build a culture of health and well-being (page 127).
Cummins believes all employees provide 
leadership whether or not they have  employees reporting to them.114
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // 
GOVERNANCE
Cummins guides employees and suppliers toward ethical 
behavior through its codes of conduct and related training.  
But the Company also strives to hold everyone who  
does business on Cummins’ behalf to the same high  ethical standards.
The Cummins Code of Business Conduct outlines 10 Ethical Principles  
that help make Cummins a sustainable company and a great place to work.
01 We follow the law everywhere.
02 We will embrace diverse 
perspectives and backgrounds, and treat all people with dignity  
and respect.
03 We will compete fairly  and honestly.
04 We will avoid conflicts  of interest.
05 We will demand that  everything we do leads  to a cleaner, healthier  and safer environment.   06 We will protect our technology,  
our information and our intellectual property.
07 We will demand that our financial records are accurate and that our reporting processes are clear  and understandable.
08 We will strive to improve  our communities.
09 We will communicate  honestly and with integrity.
10 We will create a culture  where employees take  responsibility for ethical behavior.CUMMINS ENCOURAGES BROADER 
ADOPTION OF ETHICAL PRINCIPLES

Mark Sifferlen discusses creating a culture  of ethics with Customer Care Manager  Marcya Carter in Nashville, Tennessee (U.S.A.).
GOVERNANCE115
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // GOVERNANCE
The Code of Business Conduct  
is translated into 16 languages and 
posted globally on the Company’s 
internal website and also on cummins.com, the Company’s external website.  
The Code of Business Conduct includes scenarios regarding each principle to provide real-world context. 
All Cummins employees are held 
to these high standards and have an obligation to report suspected 
violations. They have multiple ways 
to report their concerns, including speaking to a manager, a Human 
Resources representative or a 
member of the Cummins Ethics and Compliance team. Employees 
can also report concerns on the 
Company’s ethics website or on the Cummins Ethics Help Line, a hotline 
accessible around the world. Phone 
numbers are available on the ethics website. Employees reporting  
 concerns can remain anonymous 
where allowed by law.
As a global company, Cummins relies 
on a number of external companies and vendors to sell and service its 
products, bid on business, obtain 
licenses and permits, and interact  with officials to move products  
across borders. This group  
includes independent distributors  and dealers, sales agents,  
consultants, customs brokers,  
and a number of other people.
Cummins employees in the  
Company’s Ethics and Compliance 
organization are actively working to strengthen compliance in this area 
by improving due diligence around 
compliance processes, enhancing contract language and delivering 
compliance training to high-risk  
third parties who conduct business  on the Company’s behalf. An area of focus has been  working to strengthen compliance  
in the Company’s distribution  
channel, especially in emerging markets. Cummins is working  
with these partners to implement 
written anti-bribery and export  control policies. Ethics and 
Compliance staff review policies  
and identify possible gaps.  To date, the Company has helped 
approximately 75 distributors  
or dealers finalize anti-bribery  and export control policies. 
Cummins is also helping its  
distributor partners in emerging markets communicate the policies 
to their employees and provide them 
access to the Company’s online  anti-bribery training course.  
More than 500 employees from 
Cummins’ independent distributors have successfully completed training  
 and the Company plans to share 
additional training with them in 2015.  
In 2014, Cummins acquired seven 
North American distributors and has offered several in-person trainings.
“We’ve been able to visit many of 
the newly acquired North American Distributorships in person to 
help ensure they understand key 
compliance areas like our Code of Business Conduct and the Treatment 
of Each Other at Work policy,” said 
Mark Sifferlen, Vice President of  Ethics and Compliance.
Cummins’ long-term goal is to 
develop a plan to ensure each  and every entity that works with the 
Company abides by the 10 Ethical 
Principles that make up Cummins’ Code of Business Conduct. 
 116
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // GOVERNANCE
SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT
Cummins’ Supplier Code of Conduct, last updated in 2013, applies to all 
businesses that provide products or services to Cummins and its subsidiaries, 
joint ventures, divisions or affiliates. Available in 15 languages, the Supplier Code of Conduct helps Cummins ensure that it’s doing business with other companies 
around the world that share Cummins’ values for sustainable practices.
All new suppliers receive a copy of the Supplier Code of Conduct and Cummins 
encourages them to adopt it. If the supplier already has another code that meets 
the Company’s minimum requirements, Cummins sometimes agrees to let them 
use their existing code. The Company’s top suppliers, who collectively receive  80 percent of Cummins’ total spending, are required to certify their intent to 
comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct.
The Supplier Code of Conduct is built around seven principles:
01 Suppliers must follow the law.
02 Suppliers must treat all people with dignity and respect.
03 Suppliers must do business fairly and honestly and  
avoid conflicts of interest.
04 Suppliers must protect the environment.
05 Suppliers must provide a safe and healthy working environment.
06 Suppliers must protect Cummins technology, information and intellectual property.
07 Suppliers must assist Cummins in enforcing this Code.TRAINING 
To ensure Cummins employees 
understand the Code of Business 
Conduct, its underlying Company policies, and their role in adhering to 
both, Cummins uses a comprehensive 
compliance training program to  target appropriate employee groups. 
In 2014, Cummins released two new 
mandatory online training courses –  Careful Communications at Work  
and Doing Business Ethically – on the 
Cummins Learning Center, Cummins’ in-house learning management 
system. Doing Business Ethically 
combined separate courses on conflicts of interest, export controls 
and fair competition, while Careful 
Communications addressed social media usage for the first time, as well 
as document retention policies and 
safe handling of intellectual property. 
“This consolidated course on doing 
business ethically gives employees 
exposure to a number of significant topic areas and drives home 
important policies in a more  
cohesive way,” Sifferlen said.
 Almost 25,000 employees received 
these two training courses in 2014. 
As of March 1, 2015, completion 
rates were 91 percent for Careful Communications and 86 percent  
for Doing Business Ethically.
ENFORCEMENT AND 
CERTIFICATION
The Code of Business Conduct is 
only effective when it is enforced. Employees understand their 
obligations to report concerns  
thanks to regular training and an annual certification process 
that requires them to certify their 
compliance with the Code of Conduct and related policies, and report any 
exceptions to Company policy. 
In 2014, 18,979 employees and 
officers, including all members of  
the Board of Directors, completed  
the annual Ethics Certification.  That compares to 18,034 completed 
certifications in 2013. Internal Audit 
and the Cummins legal staff reviewed any exceptions to ensure they were 
documented and investigated.
(See page 105 for more on the 
investigation process.)117
COMPLIANCE TRAINING
Thousands of employees receive compliance training every year at Cummins.  
These figures are accumulated enrollments for active Cummins employees  
going back to when the training courses were first implemented.  
The oldest courses extend back to 2005.

Another important part of the Ethics 
and Compliance organization’s job 
is to monitor any new compliance laws and determine how those laws 
affect Cummins. In 2014, Cummins 
complied with a U.S. law requiring publicly traded companies to disclose 
whether or not they use tin, tungsten, 
tantalum and gold in their products. These minerals, also known as 
conflict minerals, sometimes originate 
from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjacent country and 
may help fund armed groups that are 
responsible for violence and human rights violations in that region.
A specialized disclosure report is 
available at cummins.com under Investors and Media > Code of 
Business Conduct > Conflict Minerals.
Cummins developed and implemented  
a conflict minerals program, including 
a policy and related processes to 
evaluate the use and source of  these minerals in Company products. 
Cummins’ policy is to strive to ensure 
that minerals in its products come from conflict-free sources.

SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // GOVERNANCE // RISK MANAGEMENT
STRESS TESTS PUT CUMMINS PLANTS  
IN THE MIDDLE OF SIMULATED DISASTERS
The best way to mitigate risk is to understand it, and 
Cummins Enterprise Risk Management is working hard  
with leaders throughout the Company to identify, assess, 
prioritize and mitigate risks that could harm Cummins.
In 2014, Enterprise Risk  
Management refreshed its enterprise 
risk assessment process; updated the 
risk management vision and mission; identified collaboration opportunities 
across multiple risk and assurance 
groups and continued developing and rolling out business continuity plans 
around the world.
With hundreds of locations globally, 
Cummins wants each of its sites 
to have a business continuity plan 
in place to speed resumption of normal operations in case the site is impacted by a critical event such as 
an information technology or power 
outage, labor strike, natural disaster or other significant event.
Last year, as part of Cummins’ 
efforts to assess the effectiveness 
of business continuity plans in a 
real-world test, the Cummins Risk 
Insurance group identified business continuity consultants who partnered 
with the Company to do just that.  
Leadership at two manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom were  
put through a stress test simulating  
a critical event at those sites.
Five experts from areas including 
business continuity, command  
and control, communications, information technology and 
emergency response simulated  
a significant event impacting  each site, putting the sites  
through a realistic, high-impact, 
high-stress situation. Various risk-related corporate groups from within 
Cummins also participated in and 
observed the stress tests.
The consultants played important 
roles throughout the exercise,  
both role-playing the situations and  also coaching the site leadership 
teams throughout the exercise to 
strengthen their ability to respond  to these events.
During the exercise, the consultants 
had the leadership group split into   two teams. One team was responsible 
for immediate responses such as 
accounting for employees and working with outside emergency 
responders, while the other team 
focused immediately on longer-term goals such as business continuity, 
rerouting incoming shipments and 
rebuilding infrastructure. 
“The stress test is an excellent 
simulation that puts you in the  
middle of a real life scenario in a safe environment,” said Gareth Hopkinson, 
Plant Manager at the Cummins 
Generator Technology plant in Stamford, U.K. “The lessons you learn  
are extremely valuable as we all look to build our business resilience.” 
Cummins plans to conduct additional 
stress tests at other facilities globally 
as part of the implementation of a broader long-term strategy to 
consistently apply risk management 
practices across the global enterprise.
“The stress test is an excellent simulation that puts 
you in the middle of a real life scenario in a safe 
environment. The lessons you learn are extremely

CUMMINS FOCUSING ON  
EMPOWERING EMPLOYEES TO  REDUCE CYBER SECURITY THREATS
Data breaches have become major corporate headaches  
and headlines over the past year.
In response to these high-profile 
breaches, Cummins Global Security, 
working together with Corporate 
Information Technology (IT), is proactively engaging employees to  
be on the lookout for potential attacks.
Whether it’s the disclosure of internal 
communications, personal identifying 
information or customer email 
addresses, Cummins IT Security group and Global Security are incorporating 
cyber security threats into a broader 
corporate security strategy.
Cummins IT Security group ensures 
that Cummins’ information is protected 
by a strong network and properly hosted applications while Cummins 
Global Security team focuses on 
establishing the right behaviors and  tools for employees to properly handle 
and store Company information.“In the past, protecting our data fell 
mostly to those with cyber security in 
their job descriptions,” said Shelley 
Stewart, Executive Director of Security and Facilities at Cummins. “We now 
realize that we need to support our 
IT Security team by empowering employees to identify and report 
security threats.”
Over the past year, Cummins has 
launched a two-pronged internal  
plan to help employees prevent 
security breaches and ensure a quick  response in the event of an attack.
Prevention efforts include additional 
training on data classification and handling, ongoing security updates 
and refresher courses, moving away 
from the use of USB drives and CD-ROMs and monitoring the use of  
 sensitive databases. All of this work coincides with a strong partnership 
with the IT Security team. 
Employees who believe fraud or  
theft has occurred are urged to  
quickly report their concerns to  the Cummins Response Center,  
a 24/7 virtual operations center,  
which also investigates high-risk  fraud attempts and unusual activity. 
“We are focusing on building a 
security culture so that employees feel empowered to properly handle 
information and report concerns,”  said Andrew Lamm, Corporate Security’s Information Asset  
Protection Program Director.
Looking ahead to 2015 and beyond, 
the Global Security team will continue 
focusing on educating employees  on key security behaviors that best 
protect the needs of Cummins 
customers and shareholders. 
The team will also continue working 
to ensure Company employees and 
information assets are part of an environment consistent with its  
motto, “Safe. Sure. Secure.”
“In the past, protecting our data fell mostly to  
those with cyber security in their job descriptions.  
We now realize that we need to support our  
IT Security team by empowering employees  
to identify and report security threats.”

SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // GOVERNANCE // GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS  
AND POLITICAL ACTIVITY
Cummins’ government relations employees are working 
around the world on issues that have a significant impact 
on the Company, such as energy policy, environmental 
standards and enforcement, taxes, trade, transportation, education and more.
The Company maintains an office  
in Washington, D.C., but with half  
of Cummins’ sales coming from 
outside the United States, the Company also has government relations employees in China,  
India, Russia and South America.
The Cummins government relations 
team works to ensure that Cummins’ 
voice is heard by government policymakers across the globe. 
For example, the Company works 
extensively in multiple countries and regions to promote and protect 
global emissions standards from 
delay or modification and supports government efforts to establish  
 greenhouse gas and fuel consumption 
standards for commercial vehicles. 
The Cummins government relations 
staff also works to foster greater international cooperation and 
understanding between the various 
countries in which the Company operates. Cummins has hosted 
international visitors at the  
Company’s headquarters in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.), and  
other sites. The Company also hosted 
U.S. and other government visits at its international sites to encourage 
best practice sharing on issues like 
emissions enforcement, development of fuel-economy standards and 
combined heat and power projects.  The Company is also working to 
improve communities in the U.S. and globally by supporting efforts to 
expand access to quality education 
and training as well as opposing legislation that threatens Cummins’ 
commitment to diversity and  
fair treatment for all employees. 
Cummins belongs to a number 
of trade organizations to further 
its business interests. These organizations help the Company  
by leveraging Cummins’ resources 
with other companies on issues  where they share similar positions. 
While Cummins might not agree with 
the positions these associations take on every issue, the Company believes 
participating in these groups helps 
ensure government officials know where Cummins stands on matters 
critical to the Company.
 CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS
Cummins bans contributions using 
corporate funds to candidates, 
political parties and independent 
political expenditures, including advertisements that support or 
oppose individual candidates.
The Company also will not use 
corporate funds to contribute to  
501 (c) (4) and 527 tax-exempt 
groups in the United States that  are engaged in political activity or 
make payments to influence ballot 
issues unless the contribution or payment advances an issue directly 
tied to the Company’s core values  
and business interests.
In those cases, Cummins is 
committed to publicly disclosing  
any payments including recipient names and amounts.
In June 2014, the Company 
contributed an additional $22,000 to Freedom Indiana, the principal 123

Joint Resolution 3, a proposed 
amendment to the Indiana 
constitution banning gay marriage.  In 2013, Cummins contributed 
$100,000 to the group, which was 
disclosed in the 2013-2014 report.
CIPAC
In the United States, political 
contributions are made by the Cummins Inc. Political Action 
Committee (CIPAC), and the 
committee is funded solely by voluntary employee contributions.
CIPAC makes contributions to federal 
and state candidates on a bipartisan basis after review and approval by 
CIPAC’s Executive Committee and

Cummins reported record  
revenues in 2014 despite weaker 
demand in Brazil and India.
THE POWER  
OF CUMMINSSUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // 
FINANCIAL & OPERATIONS
Cummins reported record financial results 
in 2014 driven by higher revenues in North 
America, which more than offset lower 
demand in Brazil and Europe.
Revenues over the year increased 11 percent to  
$19.2 billion. Meanwhile, revenues in North America 
increased 20 percent over the same time period while 
international sales went up 2 percent as growth in  China offset weaker demand in Brazil and India. 
Net income attributable to Cummins for the full year was 
$1.65 billion ($9.02 per diluted share), or $1.67 billion  ($9.13 per diluted share) excluding one-time items,  
up from $1.48 billion ($7.91 per diluted share) in 2013.
EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) was $2.5 billion 
or 13 percent of sales for 2014. Excluding one-time items, 
EBIT was $2.53 billion or 13.2 percent compared to  
$2.16 billion or 12.5 percent of sales in 2013. 
Production started in 2014 on the G Series  
platform in China, a new global heavy-duty  engine designed to meet a broad variety of  on-highway and off-highway uses in the region.CUMMINS ACHIEVES  
RECORD FINANCIAL 
YEAR IN 2014
FINANCIAL & OPERATIONSFINANCIAL & OPERATIONSSUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // FINANCIAL & OPERATIONS125
“We reported record revenues  
in 2014 despite weak economic 
conditions in several of our most 
important international markets,”  said Cummins Chairman and CEO 
Tom Linebarger. “Revenues grew  
11 percent as demand in on-highway markets in North America improved, 
we continued executing our distributor 
acquisition strategy and we delivered strong growth in China driven by  
new products.”
The 2014 numbers returned the 
Company to its previous growth history 
after sales were flat between 2012 and 
2013. Since 2010, external sales have grown about 45 percent.
Cummins improvement in profitability 
was driven in 2014 by record performance in the Components  and Distribution businesses and higher earnings in the Engine Business. 
Full-year sales in Components  
were up 18 percent compared  to the year before while overall  
sales in Distribution were up  
about 38 percent compared to 2013.  The Engine Business Unit, meanwhile,  
was up about 9 percent for overall sales compared to the year before.
The Company also benefited from 
its decision to acquire the remaining 
equity in its North American distributors to leverage their expertise and provide 
the best support to customers. 
Acquisitions contributed about 3 percent to revenue growth in 2014.
Cummins also invested a record 
$754 million back into the Company, primarily into research and development (page 63). 
“We continued to invest in future 
growth, reflecting our commitment to technology and product leadership, 
while growing EBIT faster than sales,” 
Linebarger said.
The Company also increased 
its dividend by 25 percent and 
repurchased 4.8 million shares  of stock. In addition, Cummins 
received credit ratings upgrades  
from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.
The Company’s financial performance 
in 2014 also included some challenges. 
Cummins Power Generation fell short of expectations, with external revenues 
down about $300 million. The Company 
is making cost reductions it expects  
will improve earnings going forward. 
“We are committed to improving the 
quality and service for our customers, closely managing costs and further 
improving financial performance in 
2015,” Linebarger said. “The Company delivered on its commitment to return 
50 percent of cash from operations to 
shareholders in 2014.”PUSHING FOR  TRADE LEGISLATION
Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger  
is working with other business leaders through the U.S.-based 
Business Roundtable to push for 
Trade Promotion Authority for the president of the United States.
The legislation would allow  
President Obama to pursue trade agreements that open more markets 
for American goods and services.
For the better part of 75 years  
until 2007, Congress authorized  
every president to pursue trade 
agreements that open markets  for U.S. goods and services.  
The Obama Administration  
has not had this authority. 
“International trade has been the 
most important driver of growth 
and hiring at Cummins for more than a decade,” said Linebarger, 
who is Chairman of International 
Engagement for the Roundtable. “Cummins exported approximately 
$3 billion in U.S.-made engines, 
generators and related products in 2014, and nearly half of our sales 
were to customers outside the U.S. 
…And, like most other companies with international business, as we 
grow globally, we add more high- 
quality jobs at home.”

CENTER’S GOAL IS A HEALTHIER EMPLOYEE
Cummins is committed to helping its employees live fuller, 
healthier lives both at home and at work. That’s why the 
Company is exploring a different way to deliver health care  
to its employees and their families.
The Cummins LiveWell Center under 
construction just north of Cummins’ 
Corporate Office Building in downtown 
Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.), is the Company’s first health and well-being 
facility. When it opens in 2016, the 
center will be home to a number of health-related services, ranging from 
routine health and optometry exams  
to acupuncture, chiropractic, and physical therapy services.“The center will be an entirely new way to experience healthcare, with 
everything focused on the patient,” 
said Dr. Dexter Shurney, Cummins Chief Medical Director and Executive 
Director of Global Health and Wellness. 
“That includes everything from wait times, to the design of the center,  
to how patients communicate with 
their healthcare team.” 
 While employees and their families will 
not be required to utilize the center, 
Shurney believes they will want to come to improve their health and 
wellbeing. The Company’s goal is to 
give employees and their families the tools they need to achieve optimal 
health on their own terms.
The center is designed to take a team 
approach to a person’s health. Exam 
rooms at the center, for example,  
are designed to encourage a dialogue between physicians and their patients 
about healthy lifestyle choices. 
Employees and their families then have access to the services that can help 
them maintain that lifestyle including health and wellness coaching, educational seminars and live  
cooking demonstrations. 
Other features and services  
at the center include:
 »A pediatric care suite with exam 
rooms specially designed for children
 »Physical therapy
 »Radiology/Lab services
 »On-staff pharmacist for medication 
consultations and limited dispensing 
 »Visiting specialists in a variety  
of disciplines 
 »A multi-purpose space for health seminars and other events
 »Nutritional and exercise advice
 »A teaching kitchen for cooking demonstrations
The LiveWell initiative is starting in 
Columbus. If successful, the intent  
is to expand the concept nationally  and potentially globally over time. 
Cummins’ LiveWell Center is designed to give 
employees and their families the tools they need to obtain optimal health on their own terms.SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // FINANCIAL & OPERATIONS128
CUMMINS’ SOUTHERN INDIANA LOGISTICS CENTER 
SETS NEW STANDARD FOR CUMMINS’ SUPPLY CHAIN  
In years past, it was a logistical reality that Cummins products 
in North America could head north out of Indiana for customer 
pickup in Wisconsin, only to be loaded up and transported 
back south through Indiana to Kentucky for final delivery.
The duplication cost both the customer 
and the Company extra time and 
money, and required using additional 
fuel, as well.
Enter the Southern Indiana Logistics 
Center (SILC), a new 428,000 square 
foot regional warehouse located next to the Cummins MidRange Engine 
Plant in Walesboro, Indiana (U.S.A.). 
The facility, which came online in 
January 2015, is the first of its kind  
 for Cummins and represents the latest 
step in the Company’s long-range 
supply chain transformation strategy.
“The Southern Indiana Logistics Center 
is a game changer for Cummins and 
our supply chain,” said Lisa Yoder, Vice 
President – Global Supply Chain and Manufacturing. “It’s a big, tangible step 
toward transforming our supply chain 
so we can continue to improve how we meet our customers’ needs through 
reduced lead times and lower costs.”Cummins began to transform its supply chain in 2010, focusing on 
ways to increase efficiency, lower costs, and reduce its environmental 
footprint. Developing supply chain 
excellence is one of the Company’s Five Growth Accelerators.
By working to coordinate the 
production, shipment, and delivery of its goods, Cummins better serves 
its customers. Effective supply chain 
management can solve many of  the problems encountered by 
businesses today.
A more efficient supply chain is also 
better for the environment. Cummins 
has established four Green Supply  
 Chain Principles for suppliers as part  
of its transformation: 
 »Collaborate with Cummins to  
create environmental improvements.
 »Reduce the environmental  impact of all products,  processes and materials.
 »Minimize adverse environmental impacts on air, land and water.
 »Minimize the consumption of  
natural resources, raw materials  
and fossil fuel input.
Consider the example of transporting 
goods from Indiana to Wisconsin  
to Kentucky.

SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // FINANCIAL & OPERATIONS
SILC, which is owned but not 
operated by Cummins, eliminates 
the need to use several Southern 
Indiana warehouses and consolidates materials under one roof, making it 
easier to manage and track inventory. 
It also helps improve freight routes  and delivery schedules.
Inserting SILC into the equation will 
mean Cummins has the capability to store an order until the customer can 
get to Columbus to pick it up rather 
than ship it to Wisconsin to make room in those smaller Indiana facilities for 
additional products.
Eliminating that extra leg of 
transportation will mean more  
than $500,000 in annual savings  
for Cummins and more than  $425,000 in savings for the customer, 
not to mention a reduction in time 
required to transport the materials. 
The new warehouse also puts  
a premium on ensuring a safe  
and secure work environment.  For example, forklift operators must 
swipe their security badges before  
 starting equipment. If they  aren’t properly trained to use  
it, the equipment won’t start. 
SILC operates almost like an airport. 
Upon arrival, delivery drivers are 
directed to a specific dock where 
warehouse staff are ready to meet them. Efficiency is a top priority.
The facility also has state-of-the-art 
lighting designed to improve safety and reduce energy consumption. Overall, 
the new facility is expected to reduce 
carbon dioxide (CO
2) emissions by  
25 percent over previous operations.
The Southern Indiana facility is just  
the beginning of a global supply  chain evolution that puts a focus  
on the synchronized warehousing  
of raw materials to provide scale and improve efficiency. A second regional 
warehouse is planned for San Luis 
Potosí, Mexico, in 2015.
“We will be able to better serve  
our customer by changing the way  
we store and transport materials,”  said Theodosia Rush, Cummins 
Supply Chain Planning and Logistics Executive Director. “SILC is the  
result of Cummins taking a hard look

CHAIN HONORED
Cummins was again recognized by 
Gartner in its annual list of the Top 25 Supply Chain Companies in 2015.
In Gartner’s 11th year of ranking 
company supply chains, Cummins joined the likes of Apple, Amazon, 
Unilever and Proctor & Gamble for 
supply chain excellence. The ranking is based on financial performance 
and an evaluation of supply chain 
performance by Gartner analysts  
and industry peers.  
“Our efforts in supply chain continue 
to focus on bringing value to our customers and shareholders, and  
I am very pleased with our progress,” 
said Lisa Yoder, Vice President of Global Supply Chain. “There is 
outstanding supply chain work being 
done at all levels of our company.” 
Gartner has been researching  
and writing about demand- 
driven practices since 2003. Cummins ranked 23rd on the list.  
It was the fourth consecutive year  
the Company was on the list.SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // FINANCIAL & OPERATIONS130CUMMINS TEAMS UP TO DELIVER  
FOR CUSTOMERS IN MADAGASCAR
Many residents of Toamasina, one of the most densely 
populated areas of Madagascar, were facing a gloomy 
holiday, literally, in December of 2014. 
The country’s limited power grid 
couldn’t adequately support the city  
of 200,000 on the east coast of the 
island nation and fearing a possible blackout, the government was  
looking for an answer, fast. 
Not only was Christmas just weeks 
away, but so was the harvest for litchi (also frequently spelled lychee), the strawberry-red fruit that provides a lot 
of jobs for the residents of Toamasina.
The country’s power utility, JIRAMA, 
contacted Cummins’ regional dealer  
in the country, Madagascar Automobile 
(Madauto), in November of 2014 asking for 6 megawatts of power by mid-December. Madauto, in turn, 
reached out to Cummins Power 
Generation in Johannesburg,  South Africa.
“We were all very excited about trying 
to do something so quickly,” said Darryn Scheepers, Cummins General 
Manager for Dealer Development in 
Southern Africa. “Turning around a request like this would normally take  
14 or 15 weeks. We were being asked 
to do it in less than half that time.”Following in-depth talks on how  
best to meet Toamasina’s needs,  
an order was placed on Nov. 25,  2014, for a fully-integrated solution 
consisting of six individual generator 
sets with a target delivery date of  mid-December 2014.
Scheepers said the Cummins team 
was fortunate that one unit was already in Madagascar that was not being 
used. So now it was merely a matter  
of getting five units into the country 
and then to Toamasina. 
The generators upon landing in Madagascar  
still faced an eight-hour trip to Toamasina.SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT // FINANCIAL & OPERATIONS131
The five units were immediately 
available from the Cummins Dubai 
Distribution facility. But the equipment 
needed to be modified so the generators could withstand the  
high humidity of Madagascar’s east. 
The major modifications were available 
from Cummins Power Generation in 
Kent in the United Kingdom. The plant 
met its deadline and the material was soon on its way to Dubai. After the 
proper alterations were made, the 
generators were ready for shipment. 
Air travel was the only viable way to 
get the generators to Madagascar on 
time, but each of the generators had a dry weight of over 16 tons each. All 
fluids had to be drained and batteries 
disconnected to reduce any hazardous risks related to leakages and sparks.
The generators were eventually packed in  
special containers that were transported  
from Dubai to Antananarivo, the capital 
and largest city in Madagascar, by 
a specialist French aviation charter company, Air Partner. 
Once again, the team cleared the 
hurdle and the project remained  on schedule.After landing in Antananarivo, the cargo was directly loaded onto flatbed 
trucks for the final 500 kilometer leg  
of the journey. Each of the five generator sets was transported  
on its own truck. It took about  
eight hours to reach Toamasina.
A competitor had also been invited  
to bid on the project, but was  
unable meet the strict deadlines.  The Cummins team successfully  
met all the urgent deadlines and 
product specifications without compromising on quality or integrity.
“This project was immensely 
challenging,” Scheepers said. “Conference calls were held daily 
between Cummins South Africa, 
Cummins United Kingdom and Cummins Dubai in order to ensure 
that nothing was lost in translation and 
that everything ran according to plan. We couldn’t have done it without a 
tremendous amount of cooperation 
and collaboration among all of the parties involved.”
The generators, by the way, started 
producing power on Dec. 24 – Christmas Eve.CUSTOMER SUPPORT EXCELLENCE AT CUMMINS
Customer Support Excellence (CSE) at Cummins means our  
customers’ success is the Company’s number one priority.  
Every facet of the business forms a chain to the customer  and one broken link can be the difference between a great  
customer experience and a terrible one.
CSE asks that every employee demonstrate the four CSE  
behaviors of Safe, Caring, Dependable and Responsive  
to ensure they’re properly supporting the next link:
SAFE 
We value the safety of our customers, employees  
and their families above all else. 
CARING 
Everything we do demonstrates to our customers  and co-workers that we are committed to their success.
DEPENDABLE 
We do what we say we will do, right the first time,  on time, in everything we do.
RESPONSIVE 
We are easily accessible to our customers and co-workers  and act with the sense of urgency they expect.

CUMMINS HELPS PATIENTS TAKE  
FLIGHT IN FIGHT AGAINST CANCER
Cummins Director of Corporate Aviation Chris Raskob says 
helping cancer patients and their families access the care 
they need can be an emotional experience for his team. 
“Sometimes we fly the same person 
to and from multiple treatments so 
you get to know what they are going 
through,” Raskob said. “Helping someone in a difficult situation like 
that can be tremendously rewarding, 
but you feel for the patients and their families, too.”
CAN – the Corporate Angel Network –  
reduces the emotional stress and  
 the physical and financial burden on families with a loved one fighting 
cancer by arranging for free travel  
to health care using empty seats  on corporate aircraft.
By working with 560 of America’s  
top corporations including Cummins, the White Plains, New York (U.S.A.) 
group has coordinated more than 
46,000 flights since CAN was  founded in 1981. CAN awarded Cummins its Corporate 
Angel Network Award for Excellence 
in 2014, citing the Company’s work ferrying cancer patients and their 
families. Cummins conducted more 
than 30 patient flights in the past  five years, ranking it among the top  
5 percent of CAN flight providers.
“Corporate flight departments like 
Cummins are the life blood of CAN’s 
world,” said Dick Koenig, Executive 
Director of the network. 
Raskob said Cummins has been 
using its aircraft to make humanitarian 
flights dating back to the 1950s and 1960s when the Company was led by 
visionary Chairman and CEO, the late 
J. Irwin Miller.
The Corporate Angel award was merely 
one highlight in 2014 for Cummins’ 
Corporate Aviation team. It was also honored for 50 years of safe flying, 
having completed 88,651 hours  
without an accident on Dec. 31, 2013.
The aviation department will  
celebrate its 60th anniversary in  
2015. The Company didn’t receive  its safe flying award earlier because  
of a record-keeping gap.
Today, Cummins has four aircraft,  
a team of five individuals maintaining 
those aircraft, two schedulers and  
15 pilots. The team, which is based  in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.), 
averages 2,000 to 2,500 hours 
per year in the air flying Company employees to Cummins’ plants  
and facilities in North America.
