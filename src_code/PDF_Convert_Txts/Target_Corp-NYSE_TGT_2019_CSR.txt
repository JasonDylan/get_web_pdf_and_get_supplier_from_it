Table of Contents� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report4A Message to Our Stakeholders
Two years ago, we started a journey to transform our company. 
Inspired by our purpose, we set in motion a multibillion-dollar investment 
agenda designed to reimagine our stores, supply chain and fulfillment 
capabilities; reposition our owned brands; and most importantly, invest 
in our team. 
At the same time, we decided to reinvent our approach to corporate 
responsibility, moving from a portfolio of philanthropic priorities to a new 
philosophy that shifts corporate responsibility to the core of our overall 
business. 
Last summer, we introduced this new framework and called it Future 
at Heart. Six months later, we closed out our fiscal year with our best 
financial performance in well over a decade. That was not a coincidence. 
We achieved these record results, in part because of the investments we 
made in corporate responsibility—not in spite of them. Future at Heart 
was designed to fuel growth and create lasting value for our guests, our 
team members, our stakeholders and our planet. 
Every action outlined in this report ties back to our ultimate aspiration—
helping all families discover the joy of everyday life—and building a 
company that strengthens the communities we serve for generations 
to come. And we have aligned our efforts around four key themes that 
connect to our company’s overall strategic priorities:  
• Empower Our Teams:  We believe the most important investment 
we can make at Target is an investment in our team. Our team 
members take care of our guests. They are our brand’s greatest 
ambassadors and advocates. So whether it is through our industry-
leading wage commitment, the meaningful investments we are making 
in training and career development or the enhancements we made 
to our benefits this spring, we are aggressively investing in our team 
members to ensure Target is a place where they can grow their skills 
and careers, take care of themselves and their families and make a 
difference for our communities.  • Serve Our Guests:  During the last three years, we have introduced 
more than 30 new brands, offering guests outstanding value without 
ever asking them to compromise on quality, safety, raw materials or 
great design. 
• Foster Communities:  As we open dozens of new stores in cities  
and on college campuses around the country, it is important to let 
these communities know Target will be a good neighbor. We do that 
in a variety of ways, from the more than one million hours our Target 
team members volunteer each year, to the more than $200 million 
we give each year to community programs, including the in-kind 
donations and aid we provide in times of crisis. 
• Design Tomorrow:  In reimagining our more than 1,800 stores and 
global supply chain, we built in aggressive climate and energy goals 
and set new policies to improve the way we operate, manage water 
consumption, recycle and reduce waste. 
While I am proud of all that our team and our partners have 
accomplished in this past year, I am humbled by all the work that is 
still left to do. This is a journey, indeed. The challenges we face as a 
company and a society will continue to evolve, but we will keep moving. 
We will keep making progress. And we will get better every step of the 
way.

Strategy
Our Corporate Responsibility Strategy� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report8Our Corporate Responsibility Strategy
In 2018, we took a big step in our corporate responsibility 
journey by unveiling our Future at Heart strategy. Over 
the last year, we have seen the impact of embedding this 
strategy across the organization through our four areas of 
focus: Empower Teams, Serve Guests, Foster Communities 
and Design Tomorrow.
At its core, Future at Heart represents our ambition 
to deliver on Target’s purpose of helping all families 
discover the joy of everyday life. It builds on our heritage as a responsible business and connects to our strategic 
priorities. Future at Heart is a road map for how we can 
leverage our core strengths and lean into our competitive 
advantages, including our scale and size as one of the 
country’s largest retailers. With stores in more than 1,800 
communities, a supply chain that spans 49 countries and 
more than 30 million guest visits every week, we create 
value for the people, communities and planet that we serve, 
today and tomorrow.As we continue building on our efforts, our work is also 
informed by our commitment to the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and the action 
needed to address the urgent problems facing our world 
today. We do not have all the answers and cannot achieve 
our goals alone. But we are committed to working together 
in a collaborative way to achieve continuous improvement 
and to be transparent about what we learn. We are eager 
to continue on this path and are inspired to join our guests 
and other important stakeholders on this journey.

Our Corporate Responsibility Strategy� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report9Materiality
In an ever-changing world, we regularly evaluate and 
align our strategy and reporting against the most material 
corporate responsibility topics for our business and 
stakeholders. The materiality process drives how we 
engage internally and externally; invest our resources; and 
adapt our strategy on environmental, social, economic and 
governance topics across our value chain.
Since the release of our last report, we refreshed our 
materiality process to incorporate external stakeholder 
perspectives more robustly. We also incorporated enterprise 
strategy and risk perspectives, expanded the data inputs 
from across the business and engaged executives in the 
process.
For the purposes of this report, we use the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards’  definition of materiality, 
which is different than the definition used for filings with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Issues 
deemed material for purposes of this report may not be 
considered material for SEC reporting purposes.
Our materiality analysis followed three steps: 
1. Identification
2. Stakeholder Analysis
3. Collation, Prioritization and Validation
Identification
We used trends research, global risk reports, retail 
and competitor analysis, stakeholder perspectives and environmental and social impact reports to build a list of 
relevant corporate responsibility topics and subtopics for 
evaluation. We then compared this list to three primary 
standards and frameworks— the GRI , the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB)  and the UN SDGs . 
In partnership with BSR, a global nonprofit sustainability 
consultancy, we further refined the identified topics 
alongside our internal strategy and risk documents to 
develop our initial list of potential material topics across our 
value chain.
Stakeholder Analysis 
We engaged internal and external stakeholders to 
understand their perspectives on how Target can lead in 
corporate responsibility and where we have opportunity to 
engage and drive impact across our value chain. 
To understand Target’s business priorities as they 
relate to sustainability, we interviewed a broad set of 
internal business leaders, reviewed team surveys and 
scanned internal policies and strategies. To understand 
the perspectives of our external stakeholders, including 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), investors, 
competitors, vendors, think tanks and subject matter 
experts, we conducted interviews and held a stakeholder 
engagement session. In addition, we conducted an external 
media scan to expand our understanding of stakeholder  
perspectives of Target and leadership in corporate 
responsibility.Collation, Prioritization and Validation
Following the Identification and Stakeholder Analysis 
phases, we collated material topics into high-level topics, 
subtopics and individual topics. Topics and their definitions 
were further evaluated by BSR to reduce bias and produce 
a draft materiality map prioritizing the topics across axes as 
follows: 
• Our ability to create value as a business through a topic's 
influence on our business success, including both risks 
and opportunities,
• Each topic's importance, including urgency, to our broad 
universe of sustainability-focused stakeholders.
Next, we validated prioritization of topics through internal 
and external workshops and individual discussions. Based 
on these insights we amended our materiality map, which is 
on the following page. 
We then mapped the potential impact of long-term trends 
and enterprise risks to develop an understanding of how the 
topics may evolve over time.
The results of this process are being integrated into our 
strategy, engagements and assessments of risk and 
opportunity for the business.

Engagement
We value the voices of our internal and external 
stakeholders. Keeping our finger on the pulse of their 
concerns helps our business address the right issues today 
and tomorrow in a timely, effective and targeted way. Here 
are some of the ways we engage with our key stakeholders:
• Create a great place to work for our team members 
through learning events, seminars and leadership 
roundtables that help us drive our diversity and inclusion 
strategy.
• Work with investors on a regular basis to address their 
questions and feedback on material topics.
• Enhance our impact by collaborating with diverse 
stakeholders in communities where we do business.
• Engage partners to continually improve our sustainable 
sourcing practices, elevate worker well-being and help 
hold ourselves and our vendors to high ethical standards.
• Collaborate with organizations and their issue experts 
in programs aligned with our environmental and social 
commitments.

Our Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Stakeholder Engagement� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report12ESG Governance
Corporate responsibility is an enterprise-wide commitment 
informed by, and integrated into our business strategy. 
Structure 
Target's board of directors has delegated corporate 
responsibility oversight to the Nominating and Governance 
Committee. The vice president of Corporate Responsibility 
and the Corporate Responsibility team work with functional 
leaders across the company to determine strategies, 
policies and goals related to corporate responsibility and 
sustainability. They regularly report to and seek input 
from the Nominating and Governance Committee on 
those matters, including review of our annual Corporate 
Responsibility Report. The vice president of Corporate 
Responsibility presents to the Nominating and Governance 
Committee semiannually on corporate responsibility-related 
topics. Additionally, new board members participate in an 
orientation program that includes corporate responsibility 
priorities and progress.
In addition, we launched our Future at Heart Internal Council 
in 2018, comprised of leadership from across the enterprise 
responsible for delivering on our enterprise corporate 
responsibility strategy.Ethics 
Ethics is at the heart of all we do at Target. Ethical decision-
making, critical to guest trust, is demonstrated in every 
choice we make. Our Code of Ethics , which applies to all 
Target team members, is our guide to ethical decision-
making and how we conduct business each day, including 
through each of our choices and actions. The code 
addresses a variety of topics, including putting ethics into 
action, working together, maintaining trust, conducting 
business fairly, safeguarding what is ours and caring for 
the world. Included with those topics is how we address 
conflicts of interest; fair dealing; required information 
disclosures; compliance with laws, rules and regulations; 
and prompt reporting.
Our Code of Ethics also describes the means by which any 
employee can provide an anonymous report of an actual 
or apparent violation of our Code of Ethics. Similarly, our 
board members are subject to a separate Code of Ethics 
contained within our Corporate Governance Guidelines , 
which is tailored to their unique role and addresses 
conflicts of interest, corporate opportunities, maintaining 
confidentiality, compliance with laws, fair dealing and 
compliance procedures.Privacy & Data Protection 
We understand the critical obligation we have to collect, 
use and share personal information in an appropriate way 
and follow the laws that prevent improper disclosure or 
use. As part of our day-to-day operations, we come into 
contact with the personal information of our guests, team 
members and business partners. We protect the privacy 
of guests, team members and business partners, and take 
precautions to keep personal information safe, following 
all applicable data-privacy laws and company policies for 
collecting, storing, using, sharing and disposing of  
personal information. 
Any Target nonpublic information is also a critical business 
asset. Our top priority is keeping this information protected 
and safe for our guests and team members. If nonpublic 
information is mishandled or disclosed, it can compromise 
that trust and negatively impact our business and damage 
our reputation. Everyone, at every level of Target, has 
a responsibility to protect our nonpublic information by 
following our Acceptable Use of Information Resources 
Policy and the Information Security Policy. Team members 
also must complete mandatory training to understand 
the behaviors and technical requirements necessary to 
safeguard information resources at Target.
Our Corporate Responsibility Strategy: ESG Governance� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report13Standards & Frameworks  
We align our efforts to a number of industry-recognized 
standards and frameworks.
• GRI Standards:  We publish our annual Corporate 
Responsibility Report in accordance with the GRI 
Standards, a globally recognized framework for 
disclosures on environmental, social and governance 
performance issues most important to our business and 
stakeholders. 
• SASB Standards:  We include certain investor-focused 
disclosures identified by the SASB standards. 
• CDP:  We disclose our management of Climate, Water 
and Forests annually to the CDP and on our website. 
We have also conducted a climate-scenario analysis 
using the framework recommended by the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), the results of 
which are incorporated into our 2019 CDP responses.
• UN SDGs:  Our work is aligned to the UN SDGs in which 
we have identified where we can make the greatest 
impact.
UN SDGs
The UN SDGs  call on governments, business and civil 
society organizations to take action to address the urgent 
problems facing our world today. Target values the 
important role these goals play in equitable, sustainable 
development, and we have explored how our Future at 
Heart strategy can support the UN SDGs. Our current focus 
is on six goals where we believe we can have the greatest 
impact.
Gender Equality
Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

Our Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Key CollaborationsFuture at Heart Pillars
� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report 15Future at Heart  
Pillars� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report16Empower Teams
For many, retail is a place to start their careers.  
Wherever one starts at Target, there are endless paths  
and bright futures. 
Early career team members find their first opportunities 
to learn and grow, as retail can be a great first job. 
Experienced workers, who join us later in their careers, 
are able to hone their leadership and expand their impact 
through a team that brings a vast array of talents and 
disciplines together to do one very special thing: Help all 
families discover the joy of everyday life. 
This work has meaning, both for our business and the 
broader world—starting with the communities where our 
team members live and work. And our team will tell you that 
the best part for all of us is doing this work together, with 
a spirit of optimism, inclusivity, connection, inspiration and 
drive. 
So much goes into our guest experience. When people say 
they love Target, they are usually talking about visiting one 
of our stores or our website. That positive and welcoming 
experience, especially in stores, is made possible by our 
store team members who create amazing moments for 
our guests every day. It also takes our distribution center 
teams to ensure that products arrive at our stores—and our 
guests’ doorsteps—on time, every time. Additionally, there 
are teams focused on everything from product design, data 
science and fabric formulation to food science, responsible 
sourcing, global logistics and technology development. This 
is just some of what makes Target, Target—in addition to 
traditionally sought-after retail tracks like store operations, merchandising, marketing and digital commerce.        
With so many options for skill-building, new experiences 
and leadership-development opportunities, Target offers 
a dynamic environment where hundreds of thousands of 
individuals from various backgrounds can grow into their 
fullest personal and professional potential.
For instance, nearly 90 percent of our store directors 
were promoted into their roles from other areas within 
Target. Store directors typically oversee multimillion-dollar 
businesses and lead teams of 100-200 people within their 
stores, earning on average $182,000 last year. 
Importantly, we are focused on nurturing a diverse 
workforce with equitable access to hiring, development and 
advancement. Diverse team members comprise nearly 50 
percent of our U.S. workforce. Target also stands tall on 
advancing women in the workforce. Women comprise more 
than 50 percent of our U.S. management and lead almost 
half of our 1,800 stores. We also have a deep focus on 
bringing more women into business areas like technology 
and supply chain. And the gender diversity within our 
leadership team and board of directors is something we are 
proud of and work hard to protect and advance.
Our industry-leading 2017 commitment to pay a minimum 
hourly wage of $15 by the end of 2020 was important. But 
that is just one facet of our team members' experience in 
a company where they find so much support to grow their 
skills and careers, take care of themselves and their families 
and make a difference for communities across the globe.

Team member:  As of February 2, 2019, we 
employed approximately 360,000 full-time, part-  
time and seasonal employees, referred toas “team 
members.” Team members include store employees, 
but do not include subsidiary employees.
Manufacturing supply chain:  All vendors, 
suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, 
subcontractors and their agents involved in the 
production of Target owned-brand, Target- exclusive 
or national-brand products for which Target is the 
importer of record.
� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report Future at Heart Pillars: Empower Teams� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report17Economic Attainment & Well-Being 
Across the board —for team members at our stores, 
distribution centers and headquarters —we have always 
offered market-competitive wages. And at Target, prosperity 
is shared by a diverse and inclusive cross-section of team 
members. Our total workforce is 58 percent female and 48 
percent racially or ethnically diverse.
Our team is our differentiator, bringing our purpose to life for 
our guests through our shopping experience and our deep 
connection to communities. As the marketplace becomes 
more competitive, the significant investment we are making 
in our team is setting Target apart.
We took a leadership position in 2017 with our commitment 
to pay all U.S. team members a minimum hourly wage of 
at least $15 by the end of 2020. In 2018, we advanced to 
a $12 minimum starting hourly rate, and in June 2019, we 
increased that rate again to $13 as we steadily rise to $15.
In a very tight U.S. labor market, the response to our wage 
commitments has been telling. This past holiday season, 
we set out to hire 120,000 seasonal team members to help 
serve our guests during the big shopping rush. By starting 
them at $12 an hour or more, we were able to reach our 
hiring goal ahead of schedule, which gave our teams more 
time to train and prepare for our busiest season of the year.
Target strives to ensure that our team members benefit from 
equitable experiences and compensation, providing on-site 
training and tools to help hiring managers reduce the risk of 
bias in their day-to-day work and compensation decisions. 
In addition, we do not ask questions about prior salary  
when recruiting new employees to avoid perpetuating 
previous pay gaps, even where not required by law.
To make sure that pay is fair and equitable for all team 
members, we regularly conduct pay audits. Our latest audit of the U.S. team confirmed that we pay our team 
members equitably, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity 
when relevant factors such as position, tenure and location 
are considered. We are committed to our ongoing efforts 
across hiring, promotion, pay and other talent programs 
that are required to achieve these results.
Benefits for All Kinds of Families 
Our industry-leading commitment to higher minimum hourly 
wages is important, but it is just one facet of our team 
members' experience at Target, where supporting what 
is near and dear to their hearts —their families —is of the 
utmost importance.
In June, we enhanced several of the benefits  we offer 
team members at our stores, distribution centers and 
U.S. headquarters. Retail is unique in its mix of hourly and 
salaried workers, and one of our guiding principles is to 
offer the same family focused benefits to both, including 
part-time team members.† Enhancements include:
• As part of our investment in helping team members take 
care of themselves and their families, Target offers Paid 
Family Leave to eligible part-time, full-time and salaried 
team members. Paid Family Leave encourages team 
members to take much-needed time off in support 
of their and their families’ well-being. Eligible team 
members are able to take double the amount of paid 
leave previously offered to team members welcoming a 
new child to their family. In addition, we now have four 
weeks of paid, job-protected Family Leave for reasons 
that include birth or adoption of a child, their own serious 
health condition or to care for an immediate family 
member with a serious health condition.• We have extended affordable backup-care solutions to 
team members at our stores and distribution centers, 
something we initially rolled out at headquarters. Our 
market-leading program will include 20 days of in-center 
child care or in-home child care or elder care.
• We increased reimbursement twofold to $10,000 for 
adoption or surrogacy fees.
Well-Being 
For our team, caring is the essence of our business. The 
care we show for guests begins with the care we show for 
each other, which is why our team members can access 
a variety of programs to assist in their overall well-being, 
including education assistance, credit union memberships 
and 401(k) options. In addition, our health and wellness 
programs include fitness discounts, 24/7 access to trained 
clinicians through Team Member LifeResources, well-
being webinars, tobacco-cessation programs and extra 
merchandise discounts with which our team saves millions 
of dollars on healthier food options and fitness gear.
Recognizing the need to support the mental well-being 
of our colleagues, our team members have access to 
programs focused on raising awareness about mental 
health. Leaders in our stores and distribution centers 
have been through a suicide-prevention training, which 
equips them to feel more comfortable supporting team 
members who may be experiencing more severe mental 
health issues. As we continue to expand our initiatives to 
address these important health issues, we are introducing 
a peer-support program to help increase team members' 
understanding of the mental health resources available to 
them, so that we can further reduce the stigma around 
mental health. 
†Our benefits strategy applies to our global team members. Global team members' benefit offerings (health, financial, training & development, well-being) are tailored to their specific geographic 
locations. 
Future at Heart Pillars: Empower Teams� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report18Health Literacy Campaign
Our team members are encouraged to take full 
advantage of all their benefits at Target. Health literacy 
is low among the general U.S. population, and by 
improving the understanding among our team members, 
we can have a broad positive impact. In 2018, we 
engaged our medical plan-enrolled team members 
through our health literacy campaign and will continue 
these efforts in 2019. The goal is to empower team 
members with basic information on health insurance, so 
they can be better-informed health care users. Medical 
plan-enrolled team members who take the course earn 
dollars for their Health Reimbursement Account Plan or 
Health Savings Account Plan. 
Crisis & Disaster Support
Our connection as a team lives beyond the four walls 
of our workplace. In 2018, as some of our team felt 
the force of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and the 
wildfires in California, Target’s Team Member Giving Fund 
was there to help. The fund supports team members 
dealing with difficult times, such as unexpected illness, 
injury, house fire or natural disaster. Team members 
raised $1.2 million for the fund in 2018, and Target 
contributed an additional $2.5 million. The fund assisted 
more than 770 team members with $500,000 in 
immediate support.My toddler and I had to vacate  
the home we had been renting  
for years because a mold problem 
was making us sick. The mold  
also forced us to throw out the 
furniture that could not be cleaned. 
With security deposits and moving  
expenses, I had to hold off on  
purchasing new beds and a sofa. 
Then my HR executive team leader 
suggested I try the Team Member 
Giving Fund. Thanks to the fund, I 
was able to give my son a  
comfortable place to play and 
grow, with furniture! Some of the 
best memories are made in a living 
room, and thanks to fellow team 
members and this fund, I can start 
making those memories again 
much sooner than I anticipated.Competitive Benefits
Our benefits  take care of our team members and 
their families and support their health and financial 
well-being.
• Wellness discount:  In addition to a 10 percent 
discount on merchandise, we offer team 
members an additional 20 percent off on a 
selection of wellness products such as fruits and 
vegetables, active wear and tobacco-cessation 
products. Since the wellness discount was first 
offered in 2015, team members have saved 
more than $30 million on healthier options for 
themselves and their families.
• Team Member LifeResources:  Team 
members and their entire household have free, 
24/7 access to trained clinicians; receive free 
in-person counseling sessions; and can get help 
with things like day care, elder care, budgeting 
advice or access to community resources. In 
2018, we helped more than 110,000 team 
members get the support they needed.
• Tuition reimbursement:  We support 
continuous education by offering tuition 
reimbursement to team members pursuing  
their GED, undergraduate and graduate degrees. 
Over the past five years, we have invested nearly 
$40 million in our team members’ education.
• Flexible scheduling:  We know team members 
have different scheduling needs, and we work to 
accommodate them. We post store schedules 
no later than 10 days in advance and allow team 
members to trade or pick up shifts at the store 
location. -  Jessica, Target team member
Future at Heart Pillars: Empower Teams� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report19Meaningful Work & Opportunities
Training & Development
Our investments in our employees extend beyond fair and 
equitable pay. We provide team members with meaningful 
work and opportunities to build and develop skills for their 
career.
We invested $10 million of additional payroll into team 
member development in 2018. The funds supported 
programs to enhance area-specific expertise and selling 
behaviors. For example, we provided 70,000 in-store team 
members with Active Selling Training to help them deliver a 
differentiated shopping experience for our guests.
We also tested a peer-learning program, Leader Lab, 
designed to build leadership capabilities. This work focused 
on helping managers conduct more effective performance 
and goal-setting conversations with team members, and we 
plan to scale it to support and enhance leader capabilities 
globally.
Additionally, we are in the third year of our Officer 
Development Program (ODP). More than 200 of our 
most senior leaders have participated in an immersive 
development experience aimed at equipping them with 
strategies to more effectively navigate and drive change  
and build and strengthen cross-functional relationships.
All team members also participate in a formal performance 
review process once a year, and receive annual training on 
critical issues, such as safety and security, compliance, 
ethics and integrity, and information security. 
Inclusion Acumen 
We integrate bias training into business training moments 
that are relevant for our team and impact our guests. In 
2018, we provided approximately 170,000 hours of training 
to help mitigate bias. 
Recognizing that being able to listen to various perspectives 
is critical to delivering the products and services our guests 
want and need, we also hosted listening sessions on 
inclusivity and belonging to create a culture of psychological safety where team members can live and work together 
authentically. The organic open forum sessions focused on 
encouraging team members to share individual experiences 
in the workplace and world on topics such as personal 
safety, immigration, officer-involved shootings, mental 
health stigma and others, while listening courageously to 
the perspectives of others. The conversations were rooted 
in our unique guardrails of inclusion and empathy. These 
are behaviors that help to guide and encourage our team 
members to ask questions in order to understand points 
of view that differ from their own, be comfortable with 
being uncomfortable, and accept and expect nonclosure, 
knowing they do not have to agree to be heard or to listen.
Skills-Based/Pro Bono 
Volunteerism
Every year, our team members apply their unique expertise 
to a variety of nonprofit programs across the U.S. Target’s 
skills-based, pro bono community service efforts not 
only help our partners reach their goals, but they give our 
team members a chance to stretch and strengthen their 
leadership skills.
• We shared human resources (HR) and digital expertise 
with Catalyst , a nonprofit that works to advance women 
in the workplace, at its New York headquarters. During 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 the six-month assignment, Target team members helped 
establish anew performance management and onboarding 
strategy, as well as led Catalyst’s digital team through a 
website redesign. 
• Team members in Minneapolis applied their know-how to 
help the Kids in Need Foundation  improve its warehouse 
recycling practices. Our team made several site visits to 
audit the warehouse waste system and recommended 
practical changes to increase efficiencies. 
• In a neighboring suburb of Minneapolis, our Guest 
Insights and Store Design teams helped create a new 
volunteer center and food storage flow and logistics for 
Second Harvest Heartland .
• To support the city of Roseville, Minnesota, team 
members partnered with Roseville HR specialists to build 
a comprehensive onboarding plan for new hires at the 
city. 
• Target's Dallas Visual Merchandising team outfitted 
and styled children of different abilities with Cat & Jack 
adaptive apparel as a part of the Bryan's House  2019 
Spring Luncheon Awards & Children's Fashion Show. 
The annual event supports the the organization's mission 
to provide underserved children in North Texas with 
specialized medical, educational and therapeutic care 
and holistic support services.
19 Future at Heart Pillars: Empower Teams� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report20Championing an Inclusive Society
Seventy-five percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 
miles of a Target —and in order to win in retail, we need to 
reflect that population in our team to ensure we deliver the 
products, services, experiences and messages our guests 
want and need. 
We embrace diversity and strive to give everyone access 
to the same opportunities. We believe that everyone has 
something to contribute and deserves to take on new 
opportunities. When we practice being inclusive and do our 
best to create opportunities for everyone to feel welcome, 
respected and valued, we all benefit from the richness of 
different perspectives. We then are able to understand and 
fulfill the needs of the guests we serve, influence and be 
influenced by the communities we support and enhance 
points of view across our team.  
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion  is timeless and 
comes to life at Target through a broad strategy anchored 
in four foundational areas of focus: 
• An Inclusive Guest Experience , where all dimensions of 
difference are valued and represented and guests feel a 
sense of belonging at Target ( Spotlight: Delivering Value 
to the Bottom Line )
• Safe and Inclusive Work Environments , where all 
dimensions of difference are valued and represented and 
where all team members feel welcome and able to bring 
their authenticity to deliver results ( Inclusion Acumen )
• A Diverse Workforce , with equitable access to hiring, 
development, and advancement regardless of a team 
member’s dimensions of difference
• To leverage our influence to reduce disparities and 
champion Societal Impact in order to help communities 
thrive ( Spotlight: The African Awards: Celebrating 
Community Contributions in Minneapolis )Measurement Matters

Future at Heart Pillars: Empower Teams� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report22Global Livelihoods
Just as we support the health and livelihood of our team 
members, we continue to invest in improving the lives of 
those who create our products. Our goal is to elevate the 
lives of at least three million people in the factories and 
communities where our goods are produced by 2020. 
By the end of 2018, our programs impacted the lives of 
more than 435,000 people.
We advanced our global livelihood efforts through 
strategic partnerships and programs designed to engage 
manufacturing supply chain workers and communities, 
so they can help support their families. Here are a 
few examples of programs that focus on empowering 
women:
CARE Dignified Work Initiative:  Target’s three-
year, $4.5 million commitment to CARE’s Dignified 
Work Initiative supports women’s empowerment and 
well-being in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam. A 
foundational component of this work was the creation of 
Empowerment, Knowledge and Transformative Action (EKATA) groups. Comprised of female factory workers, 
the groups provide training, facilitate access to social 
services and act as an information resource for other 
workers. Through the EKATA trainings, workers also are 
able to identify barriers to their rights and well-being and 
then act to address them through awareness campaigns 
and worker-management forums.  
HERproject:  We have partnered with BSR’s HERproject , 
an initiative to empower women working in global supply 
chains via workplace-based interventions on health, 
financial inclusion, and gender equality. Our engagement 
focused on providing workers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, 
China and Indonesia access to HERhealth, HERfinance 
and HERrespect —three programs that empower 
women in global supply chains by providing better 
access to information and services. Using a well-proven 
peer education model, more than 48,500 people have 
benefited from Target's partnership with HERproject 
since 2017.
Future at Heart Pillars: Empower Teams� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report23Family Friendly Spaces:  Following a pilot program 
with the ICTI Ethical Toy Program  and the Center for 
Child-Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility , 
Target expanded the implementation of summer Family 
Friendly Spaces in 10 new factories in China with a grant 
administered by CAF America. The creation of safe 
spaces allows children of migrant workers to visit during 
the summer months. With millions of children being left 
behind when their parents leave to find work, Target’s 
investment in Family Friendly Spaces is strengthening 
family connections in our supply chain. 
Nirapon:  Target was a founding member of the Alliance 
for Bangladesh Worker Safety in 2013, and we have 
continued our focus on elevating safety conditions 
for garment factory workers across Bangladesh 
and elsewhere. When the Alliance wound down its 
operations at the end of 2018, several former Alliance 
members and other brands launched Nirapon , a locally 
managed organization tasked with overseeing the 
ongoing safety, training and help-line efforts of the 
factories from which Nirapon members source. 
Life and Building Safety (LABS) Initiative:  Target is a 
founding participant and steering committee member 
in the LABS , a collaboration between global apparel 
and footwear brands and retailers with a goal to prevent 
structural, electrical and fire-safety issues through a 
shared standard.
According to a landmark study published in The 
Lancet, eyeglasses have the potential to dramatically 
boost worker productivity, and reduce poverty 
worldwide, by 20 percent or more. Through our 
partnership with VisionSpring , we are providing eye 
care screenings and eyeglasses to workers in our 
manufacturing supply chain so they can earn, learn 
and be safe. In 2018, our investment resulted in 
11,390 people in India and the Philippines receiving 
eye care screenings, and those that needed glasses 
received them.
The benefits of vision correction for 
workers extends well beyond the 
workplace. After getting eyeglasses 
for the first time, workers reported 
significant reductions in headaches 
and feelings of frustration. They also 
saw dramatic increases in reading 
newspapers and holy books, helping 
their children with homework and 
preparing food and deciphering text 
messages—an asset that makes it 
possible to participate in things like 
mobile banking. With clear vision, 
the future is brighter for individuals, 
their families and local economies.
-  Ella Gudwin, President of VisionSpring
Future at Heart Pillars: Empower Teams� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report24Human Rights
Target respects the rights of workers who create our 
products. Our Labor and Human Rights policies  provide 
clear direction to our manufacturing suppliers regarding 
hiring practices, forced labor, discrimination and other 
critical labor rights.
Suppliers must also comply with our Code of Ethics , 
Vendor Code of Conduct  and Standards of Vendor 
Engagement ; conduct their business with a high level of 
integrity; and maintain transparent and accurate records. 
Through our responsible sourcing audit program , 
we assess working conditions, labor practices, 
environmental management and compliance with local 
laws. 
Underpinning our policies and practices is our 
commitment to transparency. Target was the first major 
retailer to go public with a list of tier 1 factories and the 
first U.S. retailer to publish a list of our apparel tier 2 wet-
processing facilities. These include fabric dyeing, printing 
and finishing mills as well as garment laundries. As part 
of our efforts to improve transparency and visibility into 
our supply chain, we continue to engage and collaborate 
with external stakeholders and vendor partners. 
In early 2019, we completed a Human Rights Impact 
Assessment (HRIA) that helped identify the salient 
human rights issues in our business and operations. In 
2018, we were also assessed by the Corporate Human 
Rights Benchmark (CHRB) , which looks at 101 of the 
largest publicly traded companies in the world on a set 
of human rights indicators. We are continuing to leverage 
this data and the results of our HRIA to evolve our 
enterprise human rights work.
Target is included in the Fashion Transparency Index 
(FTI), a project of nonprofit Fashion Revolution , which 
reviews and ranks 200 of the largest global fashion 
and apparel brands and retailers in governance and 
transparency practices. Target scored 36 percent, which  
was an increase of 1.6 percent over 2018, and above 
the 22 percent average for all 200 brands.Eliminating Forced Labor
We are committed to working with our supply chain 
partners and industry experts to help prevent, identify and 
swiftly eradicate forced labor in our global supply chains.  
We believe that workers have the right to engage in work 
willfully, maintain their economic and physical freedom, 
be paid for their work and terminate employment without 
penalty. We also believe that conditions should be 
equitable and all workers should feel safe at work. 
We will not work with suppliers who violate these rights. 
We recognize that eliminating forced labor requires 
preventative measures, sophisticated identification 
techniques and collaborative remediation. To do this 
work successfully, we have enhanced our processes 
and established key partnerships with experts like the 
International Justice Mission (IJM) , Verité, ELEVATE  and 
Impactt .
We believe in responsible recruitment. This is an issue 
that is particularly important for foreign migrant workers. 
Target is a proud member of the Leadership Group for 
Responsible Recruitment (LGRR) , an initiative of the 
Institute for Human Rights and Business (IHRB). Launched 
in May 2016, the LGRR is a collaboration between leading 
companies and expert organizations committed to driving 
positive change in the way migrant workers are recruited. 
Recruiting migrant workers into global supply chains 
involves a range of fees and costs. Charging these 
expenses to workers can create situations of debt 
bondage and leave them vulnerable to exploitation. The 
aim of the LGRR is to move the industry to eradicate the 
practice of worker-borne fees. Members are committed 
to improving global recruitment practices based on the 
Employer Pays Principle: No worker should pay for a 
job. The costs of recruitment should be borne not by the 
worker, but by the employer.The Open Apparel Registry (OAR)  is an open source 
tool that maps garment facilities worldwide. It creates 
a unique ID for all apparel and footwear factories, 
with the aim of facilitating collaboration and data 
sharing. This work will also directly benefit Target 
as we continue to move toward industry-aligned 
protocols and equivalencies. On a quarterly basis, 
Target publishes apparel and accessories tier 1 
factories and apparel tier 2 factories that produce 
owned-brand products to the OAR platform. OAR 
not only aligns with our commitment to supply chain 
transparency, but helps build on it.

Future at Heart Pillars: Empower Teams� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report25Serve Guests
The retail landscape continues to be defined by shifting 
consumer demographics preferences and global 
digitization that are changing the way people shop.
Driven by generational shifts and our vibrantly diverse 
communities, consumers increasingly want their 
purchases to reflect their values and worldviews. While 
price and quality remain priorities, shoppers also want 
products with purpose that support social causes and 
do not harm the planet. And they are turning to retailers 
to offer curated assortments that enable healthy and 
sustainable lifestyles.  Consumers are also shopping differently. They still 
expect a shop-and-socialize experience in stores, while 
also increasingly looking for the convenience of delivery 
and pickup on their terms, including same-day service.
These changes make for exciting times at Target. We are 
innovating across our portfolio of owned and national 
brands to improve the environmental and social impacts 
of the products we sell. We are also working so that all 
families can find products that reflect their diverse needs, 
and the shopping experiences to match whenever they 
walk through our doors, all while providing the great 
value they have come to expect from us.

Relevant UN SDG:
� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report Future at Heart Pillars: Serve Guests� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report26Managing Chemicals  
Across Our Business
Our guests want the best for themselves and their 
families, and they trust us to deliver products that are 
better for people and better for the planet. We prioritize 
the areas guests tell us are most important to them—
such as products that go in, on and around their bodies. 
Increasingly, they want to understand what ingredients 
are in the products they use, where these ingredients are 
sourced and the potential impacts on human health and 
the planet.
Through our chemicals strategy , we are committed to 
using our size, scale and expertise to drive transparency; 
proactive and progressive chemical management ; and 
innovation across our entire value chain, operations and 
product assortments. We hope that our robust approach 
will continue to accelerate similar efforts across the 
industry.
Our progress on the strategy has evolved over the past 
year. For example, we continue to gain insights into the 
ingredients used in the products we offer to our guests, 
achieving full business-to-business ingredient disclosure 
in our owned-brand beauty, baby care, personal 
care and household cleaning formulated products. 
As a result, over the course of 2018, we doubled the 
number of products for which we can report data. 
We have access to screen 76 percent of our in-scope 
assortment, and we know from that screening that at 
least 22 percent meet our transparency goal and at least 
44 percent meet our chemical management goal as of 
2018. That is up from at least 6 percent meeting the 
transparency goal and at least 7 percent meeting the 
chemical management goal in 2017.
With the launch of our Smartly  brand of essentials and 
personal care products in October 2018, we are working 
toward our ambitious transparency and chemical management requirements. Smartly was made possible 
through our team’s engagement and collaboration with 
select fragrance houses. We were able to develop a 
process that allows screening of ingredients without 
revealing the intellectual property behind formulations, 
something that has been a roadblock to full transparency 
in the industry until now. We are evolving the full line of 
Smartly products to meet our requirements by the end 
of 2020.
We also are actively pursuing and promoting new, 
innovative approaches to chemical development and the 
commercialization of better alternatives. Since 2017, we 
awarded nearly $2.5 million in green chemistry grants  
to nine organizations, putting us well on our way to our 
$5 million investment by 2022 goal. The grantees' work 
will focus on four key areas: awareness, transparency, 
chemical assessment and safer alternatives. Stacy 
Glass, executive director of MaterialWise  and one of our 
grant recipients, notes, “Without robust, high-quality 
data, the question of what constitutes safer alternatives 
cannot be answered, and everyone in the value chain is 
vulnerable to regrettable substitutions. Reliable chemical 
data underpins the entire pathway to safer, healthier 
products. Target's early stage investment in MaterialWise 
is transforming how industry accesses and uses trusted, 
scientific data to make informed decisions about the 
chemicals they use in their products.”In March 2019, Target hosted a hackathon to bring 
the industry together to spark innovation on the 
removal of undesirable flame retardant chemicals 
from children’s loose-fit sleepwear. Together with 
brands, other industry partners and students, 
innovative proposals were developed that would 
meet regulatory requirements (e.g., flammability), 
guest preferences and sustainability goals. Target 
provided a stipend to the winning team and is 
working with the team to test the viability of its 
idea.

have a two-year guarantee and can be returned to 
the company to be remade into new footwear . 
We also stopped selling Styrofoam coolers 
beginning with our Summer 2019 assortment. 
Instead, we are offering our guests another 
convenient option that is biodegradable: Igloo’s 
new foam-free RECOOL cooler , which is made 
from tree pulp and is sturdy, reusable and 
functional. 
Future at Heart Pillars: Serve Guests� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report28Designing for All
We are at our best when all guests see themselves in 
our offerings. We want them to feel welcomed, included 
and joyful when they shop with us, so it is important 
that they are reflected, in every dimension, across our 
entire business. This comes to life in a number of ways. 
We created ongoing training for teams on how to stay 
connected to the varied needs of our guests and to give 
them the autonomy to design and promote new products. 
As we continue to talk to our guests, we are designing and 
introducing new products, such as the sensory-friendly and 
adaptive items within our Cat & Jack , Universal Threa d, A 
New Day  and Pillowfort  brands. And when it comes to our 
advertising, our swimwear  campaigns celebrate women of 
all sizes, body types and skin tone, free of airbrushing. Our 
new intimates and sleepwear  brands, like Auden, are also 
focused on body positivity, inclusiveness and celebrating all 
body types. And for more than 25 years, we have included 
people with all different abilities in our advertising as a 
reflection of our guests and the communities that we serve. 
Beauty for All
We believe our guests should be able to walk into Target 
and see their needs reflected in our offerings. With more 
than 1,000 products that meet the unique beauty needs 
of our guests, there is something for a wide variety of skin 
tones, skin care need and hair type. One specific example 
is Girl + Hair , a natural protective hair care line that is 
about empowering women to embrace their natural hair. 
Created by Dr. Camille Howard-
Verovic and Josef Verovic, the 
brand participated in our Target 
Takeoff retail accelerator in 2018. 
As a direct result of participation 
in the five-week retail boot camp 
and pitch day, Girl + Hair is now 
available on Target.com and on the 
shelves at more than 400 Target 
stores. Supporting Emerging  
Beauty Brands  
Knowing we can do more to serve our guests, the focus  
of our first 2019 Target Takeoff retail accelerator program is 
on emerging beauty brand categories. From all-natural skin 
care to wellness remedies and beauty supplements, it was 
designed to bring evolving guests' needs to the forefront. 
Participants’ new products include woman-owned, natural 
brands like Terra Origin , a beauty supplements and 
powders brand, and Olive + M , an all-natural skin care 
brand. 
SPOTLIGHT:  
For All Kids:  
Providing Affordable  
& Inclusive Products
Early in 2019, Pillowfort, our affordable and stylish line of 
kids’ products, launched its latest assortment designed for 
families seeking sensory-friendly products . Taking a page 
from the approach we took for our Cat & Jack adaptive 
apparel line, our design team spent lots of time soaking up 
guests’ stories and feedback. Then they designed every 
single item in the nearly 20-piece assortment to help meet 
kids’ and parents’ unique needs and blend beautifully into 
their homes. A few of the sensory-friendly items and design 
details that will help kids feel comfortable and confident as 
they take on their day include a rocking desk and activity 
chairs that enable increased motion; an indoor sensory 
tent that is great for quiet time, homework or reading; and 
a blanket that applies weighted pressure for relaxation and 
calmness.    
Future at Heart Pillars: Serve Guests� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report29
Serving Guests Through  
Our Team & Suppliers  
To continue to serve the needs of our evolving guests, 
we need diverse suppliers. In 2018, we hosted a Black-
Owned Vendor Fair at our Minneapolis headquarters.
Designed to let merchants and vendors connect and
get to know one another, the event attracted
approximately 30 local and national vendors. The fair 
was part of Black History Month engagement by the 
African American Business Council (AABC), a Target 
employee resource group (ERG). As a direct result of 
the fair, several brands were given line reviews and 
consideration, including the Black Card Revoked  game, 
which was introduced across our stores in early 2019.
In celebration of Asian Heritage Month 2019, we 
highlighted several Asian American-owned business 
partners that help us bring guest-favorite items to Target. 
One was Cocokind. Founded by CEO Priscilla Tsai, it 
is a San Francisco-based natural and organic beauty 
brand. The products are in nearly all of our stores and on 
Target.com and meet our Target Clean standards.SPOTLIGHT:  
Delivering Value  
to the Bottom Line
We offered our largest and most comprehensive Black 
History Month assortment  in 2019 to date— all designed, 
developed and curated by Target team members   
under the leadership of Target Senior Product Designer 
Le-Spencer Walker. Using his authenticity and a 
consultative approach—drawing insights from our 
African American team members, his team and Target 
guests—Walker created an exceptional experience that 
was shared by all contributors. "Great product design 
only comes from great collaboration,” Walker explains. 
“We developed a mood for the collection, and I engaged 
in conversations with our guests to understand what is 
valued and what creates a good collection." Clearly, a 
combination for success.incubato r
Multiple generations coexist in the world today, 
with different needs and values. When looking 
at ways to support the youngest of them, we 
launched our Target Incubator , the latest addition 
to our accelerator portfolio. It is a program aimed at 
helping Gen-Z entrepreneurs with their aspirations 
to make the world a better place with “better 
for people” or “better for the planet” ideas. This 
summer, eight selected companies joined us at our 
Minneapolis headquarters for an eight-week course 
to learn all about the world of retail. Throughout the 
program, participants networked with like-minded 
entrepreneurs and developed skills in negotiations, 
branding, pitching and more. They also had access 
to Target’s resources and mentors to help them as 
they continue to grow their business, and showcased 
their final pitches in front of Target and industry 
business leaders at Demo Day.
Future at Heart Pillars: Serve Guests� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report30Foster Communities
The communities where we live and work sustain 
businesses, employees and families. We recognize that 
our success is intrinsically linked to their health and 
vitality, and so our intent is to accelerate opportunities 
across our business to contribute to communities’ 
resilience and prosperity.
We apply our assets, capabilities and resources that 
make us successful as a business to our investments 
in our communities to ensure opportunities for all. Our 
investments will be in transformational and catalytic 
programs and partners that reshape economic and 
social systems in our hometown, throughout the U.S. 
and around the globe. 
Target's philanthropic efforts are rooted in our 
company's purpose of helping all families discover the 
joy of everyday life and our values of optimism, inclusivity 
and connection. Community has always been at the core 
of who we are. Indeed, since 1946, Target has given 5 percent of profit to communities. It is a commitment 
we are proud to uphold today, equating to millions of 
dollars a week. Philanthropy is one way we can address 
some of the world's toughest social and environmental 
challenges in our communities. It allows us to draw on 
Target's strengths, including team members, stores 
footprint, global reach, products and partners, and 
deliver an even greater impact. We have three primary 
ways we philanthropically support our communities: 
• The Target Foundation
• Corporate and local giving
• Team member engagement
By investing in the places where we live and work, we 
hope to help create more sustainable communities 
for future generations of guests, team members and 
broader society.

� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report Future at Heart Pillars: Foster Communities� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report31Accelerating Opportunity for All
Target provides economic opportunities across the U.S. and 
globally, including in communities that historically have not 
had equal prospects. 
Diversifying Our Pipeline
By harnessing our role to accelerate economic development 
everywhere we operate, we create jobs and entrepreneurial 
opportunities for an increasingly diverse and inclusive local 
supply chain. We believe the next generation of innovators, 
change makers and leaders see the world differently and 
recognize different solutions in a way that can both grow 
business and strengthen society.
We are focused on promoting women- and minority-owned 
businesses, which represent a sizeable opportunity for 
community resiliency and prosperity in order to address 
21st-century challenges. Over the last 10 years, minority 
business enterprises accounted for more than 50 percent 
of the two million new businesses started in the U.S. and 
created 4.7 million jobs. These companies already play 
a critical role in product development, service delivery 
and other areas across our operations. Through our 
entrepreneurial accelerator programs, supplier diversity 
mentoring, and diversity-focused vendor fairs, we are 
providing access to resources, knowledge and markets to 
help grow their capacity and amplify their contributions to 
our business and communities. 
We are also investing in our communities through job 
creation, not only for team members in our stores and 
distribution centers, but through indirect sourcing. Our store 
remodeling program, for example, has invested billions of 
dollars into communities through its distribution of wages 
to locally hired contractors and the multiplier effect of their 
local spending on the products and services they need.Jobs & Skills
Target's strategy acknowledges our opportunity and 
responsibility to leverage our influence to reduce disparities 
and champion societal impact in order to help communities  
thrive. One way we do this is connecting underserved and 
under-resourced community members to skills training  
and jobs.
Target joined the Dougherty Family College  team in 2018, 
along with other corporate partners, to help students 
with financial need kick-start their college education and 
land their first professional job. Launched in 2017 at the 
University of St. Thomas’ Minneapolis campus, Dougherty 
offers students a two-year associate degree, putting them 
on the path to a bachelor's degree. Annual tuition and 
other costs are offset through grants and scholarships, and 
the support of corporate partners who bring students on 
through paid intern positions. Target’s partnership, a cross-
functional effort between our Corporate Responsibility, 
Talent Acquisition, HR and several other internal business 
areas, welcomed several interns to positions in our stores 
and on our Strategy & Innovation team. We anticipate that 
additional interns will join us in the fall of 2019. In addition, 
our talent acquisition team has participated in skills-based 
volunteering with staff and students at the college.
As part of our commitment to hire North Minneapolis 
residents into Target jobs, we also continued our 
partnership with Twin Cities R!SE (TCR) , a nonprofit 
dedicated to transforming lives through personal 
empowerment, career training and meaningful employment. 
Our partnership focuses on training and hiring TCR 
participants into roles in the Target Service Center and, new 
in 2018, in our distribution centers. By the end of 2018, we 
hired 30 TCR participants, including 20 Financial and Retail 
Services call center team members and six distribution 
center team members.
In addition, for the last nine years, we have partnered with 
Genesys Works , a nonprofit helping underserved high school and college students secure technology internships. 
Target has hosted hundreds of students and, over the last 
few years, hired a number of former interns as full-time 
team members.
Going Into Communities:  
Bringing Target to Miami
Target Lab is a new immersive professional development 
experience we created to inspire the workforce of the future 
through meaningful interactions, speakers, workshops, 
activities, product showcases and networking, while 
highlighting Target as a great place to work. In May 
2019, we hosted a Target Lab in Miami that featured 
several professional-development, career-connection 
and community-building activities. The at-capacity 
experience brought together diverse professionals from the 
Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility (HACR), 
Prospanica and Management Leadership for Tomorrow 
(MLT), students, local team members and Target’s top 
Hispanic leaders, to attend the Target Lab. 
Future at Heart Pillars: Foster Communities� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report32Caring for Our Communities
With more than 1,800 stores across the U.S. and 
approximately 360,000 team members, we have an 
extraordinary opportunity to support and strengthen our 
neighborhoods through action when disaster strikes and 
year-round volunteerism.
Disaster Response 
Given the breadth of our operations in the U.S., every 
disaster—whether natural or man-made—has the potential 
to impact us locally. We are committed to responding to 
disasters  in our communities so that we can keep our 
Target team safe, reopen our stores quickly to expedite 
recovery and help get those communities back on their feet.  
In September 2018, after the catastrophic floods caused 
by Hurricane Florence  in North and South Carolina, we 
committed $1 million to help with local cleanup and 
recovery. We also matched donations made through our 
Team Member Giving Fund, up to $500,000, to support 
team members directly affected by the disaster. 
In October, as communities in Florida braced for Hurricane 
Michael , our local teams secured the nearly 330 Target 
properties in the path of the storm. Some of our stores 
close to the coast are built with hurricane-resistant glass. 
We shuttered the windows and entrances of other stores to 
protect them from the elements. We also sent generators 
to many of our facilities to help prepare in case they lost 
power. At the same time, our distribution teams shipped 
extra trailers of essential products—bottled water, flashlights 
and food—to make sure guests had what they needed to 
weather the storm. We also committed to supporting our local partners. We made funding available to our stores to 
provide GiftCard assistance to local nonprofits supporting 
those in immediate need and donated $1 million to help 
with recovery efforts. In addition, 168 team members 
received financial support through Target’s Team Member 
Giving Fund.
Disaster struck again in November, as the deadliest 
wildfires in California  history burned across the state. 
Local teams worked quickly to secure nearly 30 Target 
properties located nearest to the fire zones. The Target 
store in Westlake Village closed for a few days but opened 
once it was safe for team members and guests. Our 
$750,000 donation helped national and local partners with 
emergency assistance and recovery efforts, as well as our 
team members. Our local stores also distributed Target 
GiftCards to firefighters, evacuation shelters, animal rescue 
organizations and other local partners.
Volunteerism
Across all 50 states and globally, Target volunteers 
continued our long tradition of contributing to efforts to 
foster resilient communities. For the fifth consecutive 
year, Target volunteers contributed more than one million 
hours of service at more than 14,500 organizations in the 
communities where they live and work in support of causes 
they are passionate about.
Supporting Operation Gratitude:  Since 2005, Target 
has supported Operation Gratitude with grants and 
volunteerism. In 2018, we assembled and delivered 
15,000 first responder kits across the U.S., held eight 
team member volunteer events at Operation Gratitude headquarters, distributed 1,500 Target GiftCards to World 
War II and Korean War Honor Flight Veterans in Operation 
Gratitude Care Packages and served on the Operation 
Gratitude Bridge Council.  
Regional Days of Service:  Regional Days of Service is 
a week of service in May that mobilizes our store team 
members to demonstrate our company commitment to 
community through volunteer projects. The week leads up 
to our annual giving campaign and concentrates the impact 
our team members make in communities across the entire 
country on issues that matter to them. On average, during 
this week, we contribute nearly 250,000 hours of service. 
One of this year's project highlights included partnering 
with Arbor Day Foundation on its Time for Trees TM initiative. 
We had nearly 1,000 team members helping to plant trees 
across eight sites.
Building bridges to the homeless:  Homelessness is an 
issue felt deeply by our team members in the Los Angeles 
area. In October 2018, team members joined with the 
YWCA of Greater Los Angeles and other community 
partners to open a 64-bed shelter for homeless women. 
Applying the visual merchandising skills they had learned 
on the job at Target, our team members transformed the 
shelter into a welcoming space for new residents. We 
also provided residents with Target GiftCards for essential 
purchases and welcome baskets, which were personally 
assembled by Target volunteers and delivered to each 
room. 
Celebrating the Contributions of  
African American Women
In June 2018, Target supported the Women’s E3 Summit 
—a discussion of Empowerment, Entrepreneurship and 
Engagement—presented by the Smithsonian’s National 
Museum of African American History and Culture. The 
daylong women’s initiative brought together women of all 
ages, industries and businesses to explore and celebrate 
the contributions African American women have made to 
American history and culture.

SPOTLIGHT:  
The African Awards:  
Celebrating Community  
Contributions in Minneapolis
To be successful in our local community of Minneapolis,
which has one of the largest African immigrant
communities in the U.S., we recognize the importance of 
investingin this community.
Target had the honor of hosting the seventh annual 
African Awards Gala  at our Minneapolis headquarters
in October 2018. Our sponsorship investment in the 
awards was one way we use our influence to support 
the approximately 200,000 African immigrants who 
are important to Target, as both our guests and team 
members.
Organized by Mshale: The African Community 
Newspaper, the awards honor individuals and 
organizations that have exemplified excellence and 
distinction in serving the community. All finalists 
were nominated and voted on by their community. 
The festivities included a pre-gala red carpet walk; 
a warm welcome from Caroline Wanga, Target VP 
of Culture, Diversity & Inclusion; inspiring speeches; 
and entertainment from Soweto Street Beat, the only 
professional South African world dance and music 
company in the U.S.
SPOTLIGHT:  
Celebrating 20 Years of Care 
Target House at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital 
in Memphis, Tennessee, has been providing families with free, long-term housing and care since it opened in 
1999. Target’s dedication to children and families at St. 
Jude began in 1996 with a commitment to design and 
build Target House, the hospital’s long-term housing 
facility that gives patients and families a home away from 
home while undergoing treatment. Thanks to hundreds 
of team member volunteer hours over the years, Target 
House has been a welcoming place for more than 4,500 
families from 45 states and 47 countries and territories. 
It accommodates up to 98 families at a time, and each 
apartment is fully furnished with products donated by 
Target and vendor partners. Target Properties team 
members support St. Jude with their time and talent 
as we continue to update and refresh common room 
spaces in Target House, with support from our celebrity 
friends and vendors.
Target hosts special events throughout the year for 
St. Jude patients and their families to bring unique 
experiences to them. A quilting network of team 
members provides hundreds of homemade quilts given 
to each new family who moves into Target House . Target 
is also proud to be the National Sponsor of the 2019 
St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer . Target’s 
sponsorship allows team members and their immediate 
family to register for free for the event in September. 
Team members are also encouraged to engage with 
their local St. Jude affiliate by helping to plan and 
volunteer at the event.
For one day in September 2018, Target helped 
Los Angeles celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
the LA Phil. Celebrate LA! opened eight miles 
of traffic-free downtown streets for cyclists and 
pedestrians to enjoy events featuring hundreds of 
musicians, artists, dancers, family activities and 
more. Target volunteers manned a bike station in 
the MacArthur Park activity hub, offering free water 
bottles, bicycle bells and sunglasses. That evening, 
Target sponsored a free concert at the Hollywood 
Bowl for families to attend a once-in-a-lifetime 
event featuring the LA Phil and fireworks. This is 
just one of the ways Target creates welcoming 
spaces and experiences for our teams, guests and 
communities.
Future at Heart Pillars: Foster Communities� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report34Welcoming Places
Our guests are at the center of everything we do, and 
we know we are successful when we create places 
and experiences that make them feel welcomed. As 
an organization with brick-and-mortar stores, we are 
members of the communities in which we operate. How 
we “show up”—not just physically, but also experientially 
and visually inside our stores and out—contributes to 
the sense of belonging and inclusiveness within those 
communities and helps us create a deeper connection 
with guests.
One way we do this is by working with partners and 
organizations to bring family fun to communities across 
the country. We celebrate the openings of our newest 
stores with activities for the whole neighborhood to 
enjoy, and annually host Target-sponsored community 
concerts and pop-up events, such as the family concert 
and festival  to celebrate the pre-launch of the Hunter for 
Target collection in Pasadena, California, or our holiday 
flash-mob event  in New York City featuring dozens of 
dancers, twinkling lights and snow.
We also want our stores to be welcoming and inviting 
spaces. Back in 2017, we laid out our plan to invest  
$7 billion in our business. This included reimagining and remodeling more than 1,000 stores around the country 
and opening small-format stores that allow us to serve 
dense, urban and more diverse neighborhoods. And we 
are well on our way.
One example is our unique small-format Target store 
in Portland, Oregon. It was recently named Store of 
the Year at the annual Shop! Awards  for being uniquely 
tailored to fit into a former 1950s-era bowling alley. It 
showcases our adaptive reuse approach by merging 
seamlessly with, and paying homage to, the important 
neighborhood landmark.
In addition, our aim is to not just build or remodel a 
store in a neighborhood, but with the neighborhood, 
by listening, learning and co-creating to better respond 
to the needs of the local community. This deliberate 
approach was instrumental as we opened our first 
Vermont location  at University Mall in South Burlington 
in fall 2018. We engaged with community leaders, 
nonprofits and the local university to understand what 
they wanted most from their Target store and tailored 
the experiences to serve those local guests’ needs. We 
added a nursing mothers' room, worked with an area 
artist to create a striking Vermont mural and incorporated 
several sustainability best practices, including 
composting our waste—all decisions we made were 
based on community input. 
Through our first store in Vermont, we are making 
meaningful economic contributions to the area because 
most of the team members are both area residents and 
new hires. By adapting and reusing an existing retail 
space, we helped revitalize the mall, attracting other 
retailers and encouraging existing shops to expand and 
renovate. Additionally, we celebrated the milestone with 
Vermont-based partners and national vendors, like Ben 
& Jerry’s and Seventh Generation.Target partners with organizations that support 
the LGBTQ+ community, including financial 
contributions and team member volunteerism, 
throughout the year. And in celebration of Pride 
Month 2019, Target contributed $100,000 to 
support GLSEN  and its mission to create safe 
and affirming schools for all, regardless of sexual 
orientation, gender identity or gender expression. 
Our annual Heroes & Helpers events pair public 
safety officials with underserved youth to shop for 
their families during the holidays. In 2018, teams 
from more than 300 stores participated, helping 
bring joy to the season for thousands of children 
and their families nationwide.
Youth Soccer Grants
In 2018, we kicked off the second round of our 
youth soccer grants  program and provided nearly 
2,000 grants on behalf of Target stores and 
distribution centers. The $1,000 grants help with 
player registration fees, equipment and training 
for volunteer coaches, benefiting thousands 
of kids across the country. We are also on our 
way to creating 100 new soccer play spaces in 
underserved communities by 2020, in partnership 
with the U.S. Soccer Foundation. At the end of 
2018, we completed 29 play spaces in six cities: 
Tampa, Miami, Orlando, Houston, Atlanta  
and Chicago.
Future at Heart Pillars: Foster Communities� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report35Target Foundation
Serving Our Community  
for 100+ Years
More than a century ago, we established the Target 
Foundation (originally the Dayton Foundation) with the 
goal of investing in our hometown community and 
upholding the idea that the prosperity of business is 
dependent on the prosperity of the communities in 
which it operates. It is an important part of our history 
and our commitment to serve and support our neighbors 
in our hometown community. As we evolved our 
corporate responsibility efforts over the last year, we also 
reevaluated the role and impact of our Foundation in an 
effort to drive meaningful commitments and, ultimately, 
more significant outcomes.  
In 2019, the Foundation expanded its support to 
help address the growing urgency of widening socio-
economic gaps in our hometown, nationally and globally.
• Hometown : At Target, we believe that the health of 
our business depends on the vitality of our hometown 
community and that a vibrant and growing economy 
is only possible when economic opportunities are available to all of our neighbors. The Target Foundation 
is committed to promoting equity for underserved 
and under-resourced communities that enables 
shared prosperity and opportunity for all. Through 
our hometown program, The Target Foundation will 
concentrate its investment in organizations working to 
address the specific systemic and structural barriers 
facing these communities. We do this in four priority 
areas: entrepreneurship, workforce development, 
housing and asset building.
• Nationally : Our national efforts will focus on building 
financial stability and security, prioritizing programs 
and initiatives that explore new tools and services that 
enable individuals to adapt to the changing nature of 
work.
• Globally : Our global efforts will focus on improving 
economic opportunities for families around the 
world, helping them to sustain themselves and their 
communities long term.

For more than 50 years, Target’s success has been 
built on our passion for innovation and creating great 
shopping experiences. Today, more than ever, that 
passion is focused on delivering better products, 
services and experiences for our guests—and for the 
planet. 
We are committed to addressing the environmental 
impacts of our business within our operations and 
across our value chain because we believe operating a 
sustainable business and using resources responsibly 
will allow us to serve our guests for generations to come. 
We are using our size and influence to help tackle two 
of the biggest issues facing the planet today: climate 
change and waste, including plastics.  
With more than 1,800 stores operating in every state, we 
have a tremendous opportunity, and obligation, to  
 address our own carbon footprint. That is why, this 
spring, we announced new 2030 goals to reduce our 
carbon emissions, and we are engaging our entire 
supply chain to help us achieve them. 
As part of our commitment to make the best use of the 
earth’s resources, we are focused on finding new ways 
to accelerate a circular economy. We believe a circular 
economy is one of our biggest opportunities to design 
a sustainable future, and is an essential part of our 
corporate responsibility strategy and our commitment to 
Design Tomorrow.
As a brand with a heritage in democratizing design, we 
are intent on putting our passion to work to bring the 
greatest number of sustainable choices to our guests 
so they can feel great about their Target shopping 
experience every time they visit.

Climate change is one of the most pressing and most 
complex issues we face. To combat the impacts and run 
our business more sustainably, we are implementing bold 
measures that aim to reduce our GHG emissions and 
increase the energy efficiency of our operations and supply 
chain. Through ambitious climate and energy programs 
and partnerships, we are advancing our Future at Heart 
strategy to create sustainable value and joy for our guests, 
communities and planet.
Climate
This spring, we announced an ambitious new set of climate 
goals . As part of our broader climate policy efforts, we 
partnered with industry expert Anthesis to validate our new 
targets and ensure they meet the rigorous requirements 
of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) . The SBTi’s 
guidelines help companies align their corporate efforts with 
climate science to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon 
economy.
Our aim is to reduce our absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 
GHG emissions by 30 percent below 2017 baseline 
levels by 2030. We are also committing 80 percent 
of our suppliers by spend to set science-based 
reduction targets on their Scope 1 and 2 emissions  
by 2023.
As a company, we have a responsibility to our guests and 
the environment to set high expectations and encourage 
ambitious reductions in GHG emissions. We are engaging 
with our suppliers to unify around these same goals. 
Whether we are working with them to reduce the impacts 
from the raw materials used to create our products, or 
are generated through manufacturing and transporting 
those products to our shelves, we know we can drive even 
greater change that will support a healthy planet. 
As the majority of our GHG emissions are in the supply chain (96 percent), we intend to partner with our suppliers 
to help them to implement emissions-reduction projects in 
their operations, which should help to reduce our Scope 
3 emissions. An example of an in-progress initiative is 
our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute’s  Clean 
by Design  program, which is reducing the environmental 
impact of textile mills. In addition, we plan to leverage the 
Vietnam Improvement Program  in partnership with the 
International Finance Corporation as it increases factories’ 
energy and water efficiency.
Through completing our analysis of our Scope 3 footprint, 
we learned that approximately 64 percent of emissions 
come from the products we sell. Looking further at 
our product categories, just over one-third of Scope 3 
emissions are generated by apparel and footwear. We are 
prioritizing work in this area, and we have recently signed 
onto the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action.
Tracking and accountability measures against our goals 
will be disclosed annually through the CDP Supply Chain  
program, which will assess both owned- and national-brand 
vendors that fall within the top 80 percent of spend, as well as the Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM)  for owned-
brand factories. Looking toward 2020, we will provide 
additional support to our suppliers to help them set their 
own targets, implement projects that reduce their emissions 
and streamline reporting internally and with Target.
Adding the Scope 3 reduction goal places Target among 
a growing number of U.S. companies that have SBTi-
approved goals focused on carbon-reduction initiatives 
throughout their supply chains. We hope our ambitions 
accelerate positive change throughout the industry and lead 
to an even greater impact for generations to come.Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our value chain

Sustainable Operations
We aim to build, remodel and operate efficient buildings and 
spaces that are designed with our long-term impact on the 
environment in mind. 
Resource-Efficient Buildings
LED Lights  
Back in 2015, Target kicked off a test at about 100 of our 
stores replacing old fluorescent light fixtures with LEDs. 
Today, more than two million smart LED ceiling fixtures 
are in place across nearly all 1,800-plus Target stores 
nationwide. And they will be added to new stores we open. 
They are already reducing the electricity required to power 
our stores by 10 percent annually compared to the prior fixtures. That is an average of 470 million kilowatts (kWh) of 
energy each year, enough to power nearly 40,000 homes 
or to reduce our GHG emissions by an amount equal to 
removing 70,000 cars from the road annually. 
Electric Vehicle Program  
We have accelerated the rollout of our electric vehicle (EV)  
program  to provide charging stations to better meet our 
guests' needs. At the end of 2018, our program spanned 
26 sites in seven states with 200 parking spaces.
Renewable Energy  
To reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we will continue 
to ramp up investments in renewable energy  and energy-
saving initiatives across our business. We are committed to 
sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for our domestic operations by 2030 and 60 percent by 2025.
We are also committed to increasing the use of renewables 
in communities where we operate: in our facilities, 
distribution centers and supply chains.
• On-site solar: We have substantially expanded our solar 
program . Over the course of 2018, we added just over 
25 megawatts (MW) of rooftop solar at 34 new sites. This 
increased our total capacity to more than 229 MW across 
more than 470 completed projects, putting us well on 
our way to our goal of 500 buildings with rooftop solar 
panels by 2020. In some cases, Target may generate the 
solar energy in support of broader clean energy programs 
and policies, and in those cases, we do not retain the 
renewable energy credits.
Future at Heart Pillars: Design Tomorrow� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report39
• Off-site wind and solar: In pursuit of our commitment 
to source 100 percent of our electricity from 
renewable sources, we signed two new power 
purchase agreements: 89 MW of solar energy from 
the Sand Fork Solar Project  in Texas and 79 MW 
of wind energy from the Lone Tree Wind Project  in 
Illinois. By 2021, we expect to be generating clean 
energy from both of these projects at full capacity. 
Our investment in Texas wind (40 MW) continues to 
provide us with clean energy annually—enough to 
power 60 stores, and our Solomon Forks Wind Project 
in Kansas (100 MW) is on track to generate clean 
energy beginning in summer 2019. 
• Renewable*Connect Program: Our participation in 
green tariff programs expanded in 2018, adding Xcel 
Energy’s Colorado Renewable*Connect program to 
our ongoing contracts with the Puget Sound Energy  
and Georgia Power  utilities. Green tariff programs, also 
known as renewable energy purchasing programs, let 
us finance and purchase green energy through local 
utilities. Through the Renewable*Connect program, 
Target joined other customers to construct 50 MW 
of solar panels in Colorado, which started producing 
energy in 2019. SPOTLIGHT:  
Remodeling Sustainably
Our internal Sustainable Building Council is developing 
model stores to showcase innovations in sustainable 
design, materials and technologies. The first prototype, 
where we apply sustainable site-design options to a 
store remodel, will be complete in 2019. Our aim is to 
show what is possible and practical in both remodels 
and new builds.  
Noteworthy Awards
• Target was named a 2018 ENERGY STAR 
Partner of the Year – Sustained Excellence , 
the fourth consecutive year we have been 
recognized for our continued energy-efficiency 
efforts.
• In 2018, Target received the U.S. Department 
of Energy (DOE) Better Building Alliance 
Advanced Rooftop Unit (RTU) Campaign Award  
for our continued commitment to using  
high-efficiency RTUs, which resulted in more 
than 12 million kWh annual energy saving over 
the past five years. 
• The DOE also recognized Target in its 
Better Buildings Interior Lighting Campaign , 
highlighting the more than 1,600 projects 
across the portfolio—one standout project 
resulted in 47 percent annual energy savings 
compared to the average new construction. 
• The Alliance to Save Energy has awarded 
Target the Built Environment Star of Energy 
Efficiency Award  for its continued commitment 
to reducing energy consumption and improving 
efficiency. 
Future at Heart Pillars: Design Tomorrow� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report40Responsible Resource Use
We aim to do our part to source raw materials in a way  
that helps protect the planet and the communities that 
source them.
Water
We believe clean, drinkable water and sanitation are human 
rights and should be accessible for all. Yet, around the 
world, clean water sources are disappearing at an alarming 
rate. Sustainable water management is a necessary 
function of normal business operations, as it maintains 
healthy ecosystems and ensures access to clean water. 
We recognize the tension between protecting this critical 
natural resource and needing it to operate our business. 
Through our freshwater stewardship commitment , we 
are taking steps to improve water quality, optimize water 
efficiency and increase access to clean water. 
Our framework takes a holistic approach by incorporating 
our existing water management aspirations as well as 
our work in climate change, chemicals management and 
sustainable resource use. This allows us to make thoughtful enterprise-wide decisions in resource allocation and to 
measure progress across our business. 
We made progress in 2018 toward our freshwater 
commitment in a number of areas, including:
Manufacturing:  Target owned-brand products are 
produced in more than 2,900 global manufacturing facilities. 
Water challenges vary by region, and we are focusing our 
efforts on those within priority watersheds where we can 
have the greatest impact. 
• We joined the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals 
(ZDHC) Roadmap to Zero Programme  and applied its 
wastewater guidelines as we set our 2025 manufacturing 
water goals . The guidelines are helping us reduce 
hazardous chemicals in tier 1 and tier 2 wet-processing 
locations and prevent them from being discharged in 
wastewater and impacting surrounding communities. 
• As a partner in the Vietnam Improvement Program , we 
worked with 23 factories in 2018 and were able to help 
them reduce water usage an average of 16 percent 
annually. As a result of all of our efforts, we have already achieved our 2022 goal of improving water efficiency in 
textile dyeing and finishing factories located in priority 
watersheds by 15 percent.
Direct operations:  Across our stores, distribution centers 
and headquarters, we are addressing water scarcity, 
water quality and stormwater flows as part of our overall 
commitment to make our business and operations more 
sustainable. In 2018, we scaled up our irrigation efficiency 
program, optimizing irrigation systems at an additional 100 
stores. With 270 total stores in the program at year-end, 
we saved 40 million gallons of water in 2018. Our efforts, 
in partnership with Conserva Irrigation , were recognized in 
2018 with the Irrigation Association Vanguard Award  for the 
innovative landscape project.
Beyond the fence line:  We are working with others 
around the world to encourage progress in areas above 
and beyond our own business and operations, through 
cross-sector partnerships, team member engagement, 
philanthropic investments and more.
• We were the first retailer to join Ceres and World Wildlife 
Fund's (WWF's) AgWater Challenge , which is working to 
advance water stewardship in global agricultural supply 
chains.
• Identified as a high-risk geography, we are investing in 
sustainable water management in California by joining 
the California Water Action Collaborative , a cross-sector 
collaborative committed to building a more water-resilient 
state, and participating in Ceres’ Connect the Drops 
campaign, which is an advocacy platform connecting 
legislators and corporations on pressing water issues.
• We collaborate with suppliers through the Field to 
Market® Fieldprint® Platform  to address soil health 
issues; develop time-bound, measurable goals to 
improve soil health across corn and soy acres; and help 
improve water quality by reducing agricultural runoff 
in the Mississippi River Basin. We also support future 
Future at Heart Pillars: Design Tomorrow� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report41development of small grains and cover crops grown in 
rotation with corn and soybeans as part of a collaboration 
with Practical Farmers of Iowa  and Sustainable Food Lab . 
• Through our ongoing work with Water.org , we committed 
$3 million last year to help families in India, Bangladesh 
and Indonesia have more affordable access to clean, 
drinkable water and sanitation in their homes.
• We continue our partnership with WWF  to engage the 
textile sector located in the Taihu basin to reduce water 
risks in our supply chain and local communities. This 
work is done by raising awareness and introducing water- 
stewardship practices through training and education 
forums. A water-stewardship app facilitates a broader 
reach to textile suppliers outside the Taihu basin.
Raw Materials
The earth’s natural resources provide us with essential 
raw materials for our products. To help us source raw 
materials in a manner that protects the planet and supports 
the communities that supply them, we have developed 
sustainable sourcing policies and programs for cotton, 
forest products (including paper-based packaging) and 
palm oil. We also have committed to more sustainable 
practices in recycled polyester, animal welfare and seafood.
Cotton  
Cotton, both virgin and recycled, is a vital and staple raw 
material for Target. Cotton farming is also critical to the 
economic well-being of communities around the world. 
We are focused on leveraging our scale to drive positive 
change within the cotton industry by sourcing 100 percent 
sustainable cotton for our owned-brand and exclusive 
national-brand products.
One such effort is our strategic partnership with the Better 
Cotton Initiative (BCI) . BCI Farmers are trained to use 
water efficiently and reduce their use of the most harmful chemicals. They are committed to respecting the rights and 
well-being of workers. That makes Better Cotton better for 
the people who produce it and better for the environment, 
while also meeting the expectations of our guests, who are 
looking for more sustainable options. Our membership with 
BCI resulted in a fivefold increase in sustainably sourced 
cotton in 2018 compared to 2017, with 22,592 metric 
tonnes sourced as Better Cotton. We will continue using 
a combination of programs that support our definition of 
sustainable cotton—primarily BCI, organic and Cotton 
LEADSSM—that best suit the varied geographies, supply 
chains and practices that Target relies upon.
In another effort, Target took part in a collaboration with the 
International Space Station (ISS) U.S. National Laboratory. 
Through our membership with the ISS National Lab, 
we sponsored the ISS Cotton Sustainability Challenge  
providing researchers with grants to test their ideas for 
improving crop production and water sustainability on Earth 
using ISS' technology. The project was recognized among 
Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas of 2019  and was 
honored with the Space Pioneer Award  at the Kennedy 
Space Center. Our hope is that the research will lead to 
breakthroughs and collaborations that enhance overall 
cotton sustainability. See our Cotton Policy here.
Forest Products  
Forests host irreplaceable ecosystems that mitigate climate 
change, foster habitat biodiversity and offer livelihoods for 
communities. They also provide essential raw materials for 
many of the owned-brand products and packaging that 
bring joy to our guests. We are committed to aiding in the 
global effort to end deforestation and forest degradation . 
We are working with vendors, suppliers and other 
stakeholders to implement our Responsible Sourcing Policy 
on Forest Products . Our hope is to increase the amount of 
responsibly sourced forest fiber we use on an annual basis. With operations in nearly 50  
countries, Target shares the  
responsibility of tackling  
environmental issues in the  
communities where we do  
business. Our freshwater  
approach is one way we are  
putting the needs of people,  
communities and the planet at  
the heart of how we work today  
to help build a better tomorrow.
-  John Mulligan, Executive Vice President 
and Chief Operating Officer
Future at Heart Pillars: Design Tomorrow� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report42As a first step in our transition to responsibly sourced 
forest fibers, we are working in three areas: paper-based 
materials, furniture and décor, and rayon used in apparel. 
A shift to sustainable packaging for our owned brands is 
also underway. In 2018, we: 
• Nearly completed the transition of our party supplies 
brand, Spritz , to 100 percent Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC) Chain-of-Custody  certification. Due 
to challenges with raw material availability, we are 
currently at 99 percent. We are working to achieve our 
100 percent goal in the near future. Now, guests are 
able to choose paper plates, napkins, décor and other 
products that are sustainably sourced. Spritz is our 
first owned brand that will be fully compliant with our 
forest products policy.• Introduced an FSC-certified wood nightstand, the first 
item in our Pillowfort furniture collection for kids. 
• Signed on to the CanopyStyle  initiative, joining more 
than 170 clothing designers, retailers and brands 
to certify viscose-apparel supply chains are free of 
ancient and endangered forests, endangered species 
and controversial sources. We are acting on our 
pledge by sourcing deforestation-free rayon through 
Canopy-approved fiber manufacturers.
• Incorporated post-consumer recycled content in our 
new Everspring brand tissue products .
Sustainable Palm Oil  
In 2015, Target established an ambitious goal for the 
palm oil used in its owned-brand food (Market Pantry, 
Archer Farms, Simply Balanced), personal care (up&up) 
and household cleaning products (up&up). We aimed for 
the palm oil used in these products to be traceable and 
sustainably sourced by the end of 2018. 
At the end of 2018, 38 percent of palm oil in products 
covered by our commitment was physically certified 
through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil’s 
(RSPO’s)  mass balance and segregated supply chain 
models, and the remaining 62 percent was covered by 
RSPO’s PalmTrace  credits. Additionally, 84 percent of 
the palm volume was traced to the importer.
Beyond work with our direct suppliers, we have been 
actively engaged in multistakeholder initiatives focused 
on sustainable palm oil. Since launching our goal in 
2015, Target has collaborated with Proforest , The 
Consumer Goods Forum  (CGF)  and the RSPO with 
aspirations of eliminating deforestation and improving the 
livelihoods of those in the palm oil sector.
Looking ahead, we will increase the number of product 
categories covered in our commitment. We will also seek 
to source physically certified sustainable palm oil rather 
than using credits where feasible. For further details on 
Target's Palm Oil Commitment, click here.CREATED AT: 100%

Future at Heart Pillars: Design Tomorrow� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report43Recycled Polyester  
As part of our focus to source raw materials more 
sustainably, we are committed to replacing conventional 
polyester with polyester made from recycled plastic in 
Target owned-brand apparel, accessories and home 
products. In 2018, we launched Made By Design  home 
furnishings using recycled polyester. This adds another 
brand to our recycled polyester product assortment that 
already includes brands like Cat & Jack  and Universal 
Thread .
Our commitment earned us a spot in REPREVE’s Billion 
Bottle Circle , one of only three companies to reach the 
milestone of using the equivalent of one billion bottles of 
recycled polyester over the years. 
Animal Welfare  
Our Food Animal Welfare & Antibiotic Policies  set out the 
standards and principles that we expect our meat, dairy 
and deli vendors to follow when sourcing and producing 
products for sale at Target. They are grounded in our 
belief that every animal deserves humane treatment 
throughout its life. We do not support the use of routine, 
nontherapeutic antimicrobials—including antibiotics—
to promote growth. We expect our suppliers and the 
producers they work with to phase out this practice and 
only use antimicrobials when medically necessary. Target has committed to transition to sell only cage-free 
shell eggs by 2025, pending available supply. As of 
2018, 40 percent of the assortment of shell eggs sold 
were cage free. We continue to work with our supply 
base to make progress toward this target. We are also 
working with our pork supply chain to reach our 2022 
goal to eliminate the use of sow gestation crates.
Sustainable Seafood  
We want our guests to be confident that the seafood 
they buy at Target was wild caught or farmed using 
sustainable practices. We have worked hand in hand 
with our partner FishWise , trusted vendors and other 
stakeholders to confirm 100 percent of our fresh and 
frozen seafood is Seafood Watch  green or yellow 
rated, certified to an environmental standard deemed 
equivalent to Seafood Watch yellow rating or better, 
or sourced from a credible time-bound improvement 
process. We will continue to seek opportunities to 
leverage our size, scale and reach in ways that we 
believe will lead to positive social, economic and 
environmental outcomes in fisheries and aquaculture 
production. See our Sustainable Seafood Policy here. 
43 Future at Heart Pillars: Design Tomorrow� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report44Circular Behavior & Innovation
Global environmental issues like climate change, drought, 
deforestation, waste (including plastic) and resource 
scarcity are bringing into focus the risks associated with 
a linear take-make-waste business model. Plastic waste 
is overwhelming our oceans and harming sea life. Raw 
material prices are volatile and unpredictable. In response, 
leading businesses are adopting a circular mindset.
These companies aim to embed sustainability into their 
business models by looking at consumption behaviors 
and capitalizing on opportunities that include attracting 
environmentally minded customers and answering the 
demand for new products and experiences. 
Finding new ways to support a more circular business 
model is an essential part of our commitment to Design 
Tomorrow. We want to be the mass retailer that offers 
our guests the greatest number of options for sustainable 
products, services and experiences, including circular 
products. Our goal is to incorporate circularity into our 
owned brands and partner with national brands through our 
assortment.  
In imagining the role circularity can play throughout our 
business, we set foundational internal priorities that 
include a set of design principles that integrate circularity 
into our business—from product innovation to packaging 
considerations and store design. By training our team 
members on these principles and the thought process 
behind them, we have been able to test, learn and move 
forward toward establishing a culture and mindset of zero-
waste living and design thinking throughout our business 
and value chain. 
We recognize that circular solutions do not currently exist 
for everything. However, we believe the circular economy 
is one of the biggest opportunities we have to design a sustainable future. We are working with a number of 
consortiums and industry partners, such as the Ellen 
MacArthur Foundation , the Global Fashion Agenda and 
Fashion for Good , to promote circular design, behavior and 
innovation.
Circular Design 
Enterprise-wide circular design principles are helping 
us reimagine the way products, processes, buildings, 
properties and experiences are designed. We focused the 
initial application of the principles on our primary goods and 
services: retail goods, indirect goods, properties and our 
events and experiences.
• Material choice:  Design products, processes and 
properties to utilize renewable, recycled, nontoxic 
sustainable materials that can be continuously looped 
back into the system.
• Durability:  Design products, processes and properties 
for the expected lifespan of both retail and nonretail 
goods.
• Repairability:  Design products, processes and 
properties to be easily repaired and/or have modular 
component parts that facilitate replacement or 
disassembly.
• Recyclability:  Design products, processes and 
properties with the ability to be recyclable and/or 
biodegradable.
As a first step to institutionalize these principles across our 
organization, we trained more than 250 of our designers in 
2018. By late 2019, we will have trained nearly 2,000 team 
members in 11 different business areas across Target,  
 including Marketing, Merchandising, Owned Brand Product 
Design & Management and Store Design.
Circular Fashion
It takes the fashion industry large amounts of energy and 
water to deliver pieces on pace with consumer fashion 
trends. At the same time, discarded clothing is piling up in 
landfills, to the tune of 92 million tons a year. A recent study 
by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that one garbage 
truck of textiles is wasted every second. Designing and 
creating fashion in a circular manner is a priority at Target. 
We are working with industry partners to develop new 
solutions and sustainable systems.
• We recently joined dozens of leading brands and industry 
organizations signing on to the Fashion Industry Charter 
for Climate Action . The new initiative is designed to 
mobilize the fashion industry to create solutions to 
combat climate change. 
• Through our strategic partnership with the Global Fashion 
Agenda, we are changing the way fashion is designed 
across the industry. We are investing in textile recycling 
technologies and have committed to increase the 
functional durability of our owned-brand apparel.
• Our work with Fashion for Good aims to overcome the 
fashion industry’s barriers to sustainable fashion. We 
provide mentorship, guidance and access to our subject 
matter experts to help Fashion for Good early stage 
innovators scale unique circular solutions.  
• We are a founding member of Connect Fashion , a pre-
competitive collaboration that is using the "internet of 
things" solutions to unlock the connected and circular 
future of fashion, apparel and retail.

events simplify families’ lives by helping them repurpose 
their belongings. Since we first invited guests to bring used 
car seats to their local Target store, we have collected more 
than half a million. We teamed up with Waste Management , 
a company that focuses on finding solutions for hard-to-
recycle waste, to find new uses or end markets for the 
more than 7.4 million pounds of recycled materials we have 
collected. Sustainable Packaging  
& Single-Use Plastics
Packaging offers one of the biggest opportunities and 
challenges in circular systems. We are committed to 
eliminating, reducing and finding alternatives for plastics 
in our products, packaging and operations. This is 
one important way our teams design for circularity. We 
approach this work with a value-chain mindset. By working 
with industry partners and supporting collaborative efforts, 
we aim to make significant advances in addressing the 
volume of single-use plastics and deliver more sustainable 
packaging options for our guests.
In 2017, we were the first retailer to join The Recycling 
Partnership . Through this initiative, we aim to help 
improve how more than 25 percent of the U.S. population 
recycles. At the beginning of 2019, we made a $2 million 
commitment to support its new Leadership Summit: 50 
Cities Driving the Circular Economy . We also provide 
ongoing infrastructure grants to communities in need, 
assisting households with the infrastructure, tools and 
resources they need to make recycling easy and accessible. 
In addition, as part of our work with the Sustainable 
Packaging Coalition , we are continuing to look for ways to 
add the How2Recycle ® label to our owned-brand product 
packages. We are already compliant and use it where 
space allows, with more than 5,000 owned-brand product 
packages.
These industry efforts align with Target’s aspiration to make 
recycling easier and more accessible for our guests, who 
believe recycling is a key activity to live more sustainable 
lifestyles. The How2Recycle label helps our guests recycle 
through education. The Recycling Partnership provides 
better access to recycling through public and private 
partnerships. We are intent on driving positive change 
through these and other collaborations.Partnerships are particularly critical as we aim for true 
system change and work to enable circularity needed to 
address the issue of single-use plastic waste.
• We signed the New Plastics Economy Global 
Commitment , led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 
collaboration with UN Environment , alongside more than 
400 brands, NGOs and other partners to eliminate plastic 
waste and pollution, by seeking to:
• Eliminate all problematic and unnecessary plastic 
items
• Innovate so that the plastics we do need are 
reusable, recyclable or compostable
• Circulate all the plastic items we use to keep them  
in the economy and out of the environment
• We are working with P&G, Dow, PepsiCo and others as 
part of the Materials Recovery for the Future collaborative. 
Together, we are working to shift to a future in which all 
flexible packaging, even hard-to-recycle chip and snack 
bags, can be recycled.
• We also continue to work to increase the demand for 
recycled plastics by creating three new end markets for 
recycled plastics and committing to advance market 
demand for recycled resin through The Association 
of Plastic Recyclers’ Recycling Demand Champions 
program .  
• We continue to explore environmentally preferable 
solutions to single-use plastic bags. In October 2018, 
we opened our Vermont store without single-use plastic 
bags at the point of sale. This store is an opportunity for 
us to test and learn. Throughout 2018 and early 2019, 
we also engaged with academic institutions and our own 
team members to hold design challenges to reimagine 
solutions that give our guests a plastic-free way to bring 
their products from our stores to their final destinations. 
Future at Heart Pillars: Design Tomorrow� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report46Operations
Our aspiration to develop a comprehensive circular 
strategy builds on extensive work Target has undertaken 
to address the environmental impacts of our business, 
including our efforts to reduce waste and establish a 
zero-waste mindset. 
Our progress is a result of our efforts and commitment 
to manage our programs across our U.S. headquarters, 
distribution centers and stores. In 2018, Target 
successfully rolled out two programs to better track and 
reduce waste. Cardboard radio-frequency identification 
(RFID) allowed us to track store-level data for recycling 
volumes and report on metrics not previously possible. 
In addition, a system-led disposition tool for food 
donations provided greater clarity to team members of 
what can and cannot be donated.
Food Waste  
As a member of CGF, we committed to reducing 
food waste within our own retail and manufacturing 
operations by 50 percent by 2025. Over the last year, 
we continued our investments in in-store food-waste 
reduction by introducing process improvements. 
In 2018, Target launched a new Food Donations 
dashboard that provides store team members with 
store-level donations data and compares locations to 
their sales volume and store prototype peers. In addition, 
our system-led disposition tool provides guidance to 
team members on what can and cannot be donated. 
The combination of reporting and new technology led 
to a 16 percent increase in food donations from 2017 
to 2018. Target donated more than 89 million pounds 
of food—equal to 74 million meals—through our 
partnership with Feeding America .We also expanded our organics (compost) recycling  
program, adding 266 additional stores and distribution 
and fulfillment facilities for a total of 328 locations.
In 2018, we also established a cross-functional, 
company-wide team to accelerate sell-through of 
food and reduce food waste by improving inventory 
accuracy through forecasting, ordering tools, improved 
merchandising, fixtures and offering guests discounts on 
food close to expiration. We implemented a standardized 
date-label initiative across our owned-brand products, 
added guest-facing store signage and continued to 
provide our team members and guests with tools to help 
them reduce waste.
In addition, work is underway to develop baseline 
reporting, so that we can measure, improve and report 
against the CGF commitment. We recognize that we will 
need to take many partners and use a variety of internal 
and external data sources to develop a complete food-
waste inventory. 
Zero Waste  
Tracking trash, donations, recycling and organics 
programs at the store level continues to be a focus for 
us in driving execution for waste minimization. In 2018, 
we conducted 25 waste-stream audits. This was a larger 
sample of stores than previous years, as we seek to gain 
greater understanding of what is being sent to landfill. 
• Our Waste Minimization team is continuing to test and 
track a Zero Waste model in our Highland Park store 
in St. Paul, Minnesota, and using the lessons learned 
to implement and track new programs. We are also 
exploring opportunities at different properties and 
prototypes to test the feasibility of expansion.
• In 2018, we used approximately 500 million plastic 
hangers in our store. To reduce waste, we have had 
a sustainable, closed-loop hanger reuse program in 
operation since 1994. This program reused enough 
hangers in 2018 to circle the globe five times (130,241 
miles, to be exact).In 2018, we diverted 75.7 percent of our retail 
waste from landfills through salvage, donations, 
organics (compost), reuse or recycling, surpassing 
our goal of 75 percent diversion by 2018.
For years, we have made it easy for guests to 
recycle materials like plastic bags and bottles (as 
well as cans, glass, ink cartridges and electronics) 
at recycling stations at their local Target store. 
The goal of the program is to extend our company 
recycling efforts, and so far, the program has kept 
thousands of tons of recyclable materials out of 
landfills.
In 2018, we donated 89 million pounds of food, the 
equivalent of 74 million meals.

Waste
Divert 75 percent of retail waste from landfills by 
the end of 2018
Baseline (2016): 72.3%74.0% 75.7% Exceeded.  After surpassing the 2020 goal of diverting 70 percent of retail waste from  
landfills in 2016 and 2017, Target updated its goal to accomplish 75 percent diversion by  
the end of 2018.
Add the How2Recycle label to all owned-brand  
packaging by 2020 (where space allows)
Baseline (2013): 0 SKUs3,843 SKUs 5,074 SKUs In Progress.  Target continues to make progress on this goal, as we added the label to an 
additional 1,231 SKUs in 2018. In total, to date we have the How2Recycle label on more

Goals� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report58Goals
Goals & Commitments 2017 2018 Update
Reduce food waste within our own retail and  
manufacturing operations by 50 percent by 2025 
in accordance with commitments as a member of 
The C GFIn Progress.  We are developing baseline reporting and measurement systems. We  
recognize that we will need to take many partners and use a variety of internal and external 
data sources to develop a complete food-waste inventory.
In the meantime, our work to reduce food waste is underway. We established a cross-  
functional company-wide team to accelerate sell-through of food and reduce food waste by 
improving inventory position through forecasting, ordering tools, improved merchandising, 
fixtures and offering guests discounts on food close to expiration.
In 2018, we launched a Food Donations dashboard that provides store team members with 
store-level donations data and comparisons to their sales volume/store prototype peers. We 
also introduced a tool that guides team members on what can and cannot be donated. The 
combination of reporting and new technology led to a 16 percent increase in food donations 
from 2017 to 2018.
We also expanded our organics recovery program, adding 266 additional stores and  
distribution and fulfillment facilities for a total of 328 locations (325 stores and three  
headquarters locations).  
We have implemented a standardized date-label initiative across all owned-brand products 
and have added community board communications (team member- and guest-facing),  
huddle topics for store team members, Earth Month engagement and internal  
communication vehicles to give team members and guests tools to reduce waste.
Product Design
Design all Target owned-brand apparel for  
functional durability to last the life cycle of the  
product by 2020Ongoing.  As part of our commitment to quality, we launched a one-year return policy in  
2015 for all our owned-brand general merchandise—a promise to guests that we do not 
compromise quality to sell products at a value.
Create more demand for recycled packaging by  
creating three new end markets for recycled  
materials by 2020In Progress.  Target continues to explore potential end markets that use recycled  
packaging materials.  
We included recycled plastic in packaging for our new Everspring brand that launched in 
April 2019. We are using 100 percent post-consumer recycled content for Everspring room 
spray, foaming hand soap, liquid hand soap, dish soap and spray cleaning products and 
50 percent post-consumer recycled content in laundry bottles. All of the post-consumer 
recycled plastic is sourced domestically. In total, we estimate we will use almost 700,000 
pounds of recycled plastic annually.
Goals� 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report59Goals
Goals & Commitments 2017 2018 Update
Replace conventional polyester with polyester  
made from recycled plastic in Target owned-brand 
apparel, accessories and home products  Ongoing.  We continue to expand our use of recycled polyethylene terephtalate  
(rPET)/recycled polyester across multiple products and categories. The majority is used  
in Apparel & Accessories and Home & Hardlines. Data for recycled polyester content is  
available in GRI 301-2  of this report.
Work to eliminate expanded polystyrene from our 
owned-brand packaging by 2022In Progress.  In 2018, we developed an approach that we plan to roll out in 2020 to build 
momentum toward our 2022 goal.  
Pursue the New Plastics Economy commitment by 
2025New Commitment.  Target announced its support of the New Plastics Economy  
commitment in October 2018. The New Plastics Economy introduces shared aspirations for 
its members, including: 
• Elimination of problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging through redesign, innovation 
and new delivery models
• Establishing reuse models where relevant, reducing the need for single-use packaging
• Use of 100 percent reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging
• Plastic packaging free of hazardous chemicals and respecting the health, safety and rights 
of all people involved
• Plastic packaging that is reused, recycled or composted in practice
• Fully decoupled use of plastics from the consumption of finite resources
Target is working to align our internal goals to help achieve this shared vision of a circular 
economy.  
Procurement Practices
Transition to only cage-free shell eggs, pending  
available supply, by 202540% In Progress.  Target has committed to transition to selling only cage-free shell eggs by 2025, 
pending available supply. We continue to work with our suppliers to make progress toward 
meeting this commitment. As of 2018, 40 percent of the assortment of shell eggs sold was 
cage free.  
Eliminate the use of sow gestation crates by 2022 In Progress.  Target has committed to partner only with pork suppliers who do not use sow  
gestation crates by 2022. We continue to work with our pork suppliers to make progress 
toward this commitment.

delegate any of its responsibilities to subcommittees of one or more persons, including persons who are not directors. The  
vice president of Corporate Responsibility and the Corporate Responsibility team work with functional leaders across the  
company to determine strategies, policies and goals related to corporate responsibility and sustainability and regularly report  
to and seek input from the Nominating and Governance Committee on those matters, including the review of the annual

Role of highest governance body in setting 
purpose, values and strategy102-26 Target recognizes that environmental, social and governance issues are of increasing importance to many investors. Corporate 
responsibility is an enterprise-wide commitment informed by and integrated into our business strategy. The board retains  
oversight responsibility over the corporation’s overall risks, with an emphasis on strategic risks. The board has delegated 
oversight responsibility over the corporation's corporate responsibility matters to the Nominating and Governance Committee 
of the board of directors. The vice president of Corporate Responsibility and the Corporate Responsibility team work with  
functional leaders across the company to determine strategies, policies and goals related to corporate responsibility and  
sustainability and regularly report to and seek input from the Nominating and Governance Committee on those matters,  
including review of the annual Corporate Responsibility Report.

Collective knowledge of highest  
governance body102-27   Typically, Target’s vice president of Corporate Responsibility presents to the Nominating and Governance Committee  
semiannually on corporate responsibility-related topics. Additionally, new directors participate in an orientation program that  
includes discussions with senior management; background materials on the corporation’s plans; and organization and  
financial statements, including corporate responsibility priorities and progress. 
Evaluating the highest governance  
body's performance102-28 The Nominating and Governance Committee, in consultation with the lead independent director, annually leads the  
performance review of the corporation's board of directors and its committees. In 2018, the board of directors  
self-evaluation involved a survey completed by each director about the board of directors and the committees on which the  
director served, followed by individual interviews seeking each director's candid feedback. Following completion of the  
interviews, the results were discussed by the full board of directors and each committee. In 2018, the board of directors 
self-evaluation was administered by the corporate secretary’s office. The annual self-evaluation has periodically been  
conducted by a third-party consultant, as appropriate.
The self-evaluation process seeks to obtain each director’s assessment of the effectiveness of the board of directors, the 
committees and their leadership, board of directors and committee composition and board of directors/management  
dynamics. In addition, as part of the self-evaluation process, the board of directors evaluates individual director performance 
through questions in the survey focused on obtaining candid feedback on individual directors and through the individual  
interview process.
The Nominating and Governance Committee regularly reviews the corporation's core corporate governance practices and 
prevailing best practices, emerging practices and evolving topics as indicated by shareholder outreach, current literature and 
corporate governance organizations.

Review of economic, environmental

Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews environmental and social  
topics at least semiannually. This happens independently of our financial reporting process, which includes economic topics, 
and is overseen throughout the year by the Audit and Finance Committee, which provides regular reports to the board of 
directors.
Highest governance body’s role  
in sustainability reporting102-32 The vice president of Corporate Responsibility at Target is responsible for monitoring and managing the organization’s  
sustainability performance, providing final review of the sustainability report with the support of key executives across the  
company and ensuring that all appropriate topics are covered. Prior to publication, the Nominating and Governance  
Committee of the board of directors reviews the annual Corporate Responsibility Report.
Communicating critical concerns 102-33 There are multiple methods for communicating critical concerns to the board of directors, including through Target’s CEO, who 
also serves as chairman of the board. Shareholders and other interested parties can also communicate critical concerns with 
any individual director or group of directors via mail or email, a process managed by the board's Corporate Secretary.

Palm Oil  
Palm plantations are a significant source of deforestation. Together with our partner, Proforest, Target engaged with vendors  
to trace and sustainably source palm oil used in our owned-brand food, personal care, and household cleaning products 
covered by our 2018 commitment .
By the end of 2018, 38 percent of palm oil used in these product categories was certified sustainable via RSPO physical  
certification (mass balance or segregated), and the remaining 62 percent was covered by RSPO PalmTrace credits.  
Additionally, 84 percent of the palm volume was traced to the importer.

Chemicals  
Target seeks to identify and remove specific chemicals from priority-category products and manufacturing and encourage  
all supporting industries to incorporate green chemistry principles. As part of this effort, we leverage strategies seeking  
industry-leading transparency, chemicals selection and management processes and investments in green chemistry  
innovation. We prioritize the areas guests tell us are most important to them—such as products that go in, on and around  
their bodies. 
In formulated essentials and beauty products, we are working toward greater transparency to ingredients every day and have 
doubled the number of products for which we can report data over the course of 2018. Our introduction of Target Clean in 2019 
helps our guests find the products without chemical ingredients they may be seeking to avoid for themselves and their families.
In textiles, we continue to work with our supply chain partners to drive to better chemical selection for products and  
processes. Our published RSL is a starting point for this journey and will help us iterate, learn and advance our efforts in our 
complex supply chain.
To help move the industry forward, we also collaborate with key partners and through external initiatives, such as the Chemical 
Footprint Project, MaterialWise’s Safer Alternatives program, the Beauty and Personal Care Product Sustainability Rating 
System (launched in collaboration with Forum for the Future and The Sustainability Consortium), the ZDHC Roadmap to Zero 
Programme and Apparel Impact Institute’s Clean by Design program.

Recycled input materials used 301-2 Through our increased sourcing of recycled polyester, we are contributing to an increased demand for recycled plastic. In 
2018, we consumed the following amount of recycled polyester:
• Apparel & Accessories: 7,000 tons
• Home & Hardlines: 13,000 tons
• Total: 20,000 tons
Target’s stated recycled polyester consumption is calculated using product-level fiber-consumption data and  
merchandise-purchase data current at the time of this report’s compilation. In the process of aggregating data to the  
corporate level, calculations (e.g., average sizing dimensions, average unit retail, finished product consumption, etc.) were 
used to closely reflect dynamic business factors and represent recycled polyester consumption as accurately as possible with 
available business data.
Please note: Reporting on recycled polyester shifted from GRI 301-1 to GRI 301-2 to better align with the standards.

• Renewable electricity includes renewable energy credits from Target’s on-site and off-site projects as well as electricity that we  
receive from renewable energy generation serving the electric grids where Target facilities are located. Data sources include: 
Target’s 2018 fiscal year electricity consumption data, Target’s 2018 renewable energy credits, and the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook (February 2019) data on renewable electricity generation in the U.S.
• Solar is for total 2018 production where renewable energy certificates (RECs) have been held or retained.
• Off-site wind is for total 2018 production.
*Data has been independently assured.
Off-Site Renewable Electricity Efforts  
In pursuit of our commitment to sourcing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable sources, our latest renewable power  
purchase agreements will help enable the construction of important sources like the Lone Tree Wind Project in Illinois with Leeward 
Renewable Energy, LLC, and Sand Fork Solar in Texas with ENGIE. Together, they are estimated to generate approximately 556,000 
MWh of renewable electricity—the equivalent of 280 Target stores annually throughout the U.S. Both projects will begin generating 
clean energy in 2021. These projects come three years after we kicked off our first wind power partnership in Lubbock, Texas. And 
in summer 2019, we expect another project to come online—the Solomon Forks Wind Project near Colby, Kansas, which we  
contracted in 2017 for approximately 420,000 MWh of wind energy.
Our participation in green tariff programs expanded in 2018, adding Xcel Energy’s Colorado Renewable*Connect program to  
our ongoing contracts with Puget Sound Energy and Georgia Power. Green tariff programs, also known as renewable energy  
purchasing programs, let us finance and purchase green energy through local utilities. Through the Renewable*Connect program,  
Target joined other customers to construct 50 MW of solar panels in Colorado, which started producing energy in 2019. 
GreenChill Partnership Results
• This resulted in 14.2 percent corporate emissions rate for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-applicable refrigeration systems 
containing greater than 50 pounds.
• A total of 62,825 pounds of ODS R-22 refrigerant was removed via gas conversions in 2018 and replaced with lower global  
warming potential (GWP) HFO-blend alternatives.
• Natural R-290 hydrocarbon refrigerant was named as the new standard for all stand-alone systems under 2,200 British thermal 
units per hour (BTUH).
• Natural CO2 cascade systems are the primary new market solution for prototypical large-format stores.
• Target also installed two HFC-free transcritical CO2 systems in California and Minnesota, evaluating overall efficiency,  
reliability and total cost of ownership for each asset.

Interactions with water as  
a shared resource303-1 For our U.S. direct operations, including stores, distribution centers and headquarters locations, we are taking action to reduce 
water scarcity, improve water quality outcomes and manage stormwater flows. 
All of our buildings’ water is supplied via municipal systems, and a small percentage of our buildings (less than 1 percent) 
directly withdraw water via water wells for irrigation. Our water is discharged to municipal systems. We are not aware of any 
water sources significantly impacted by our withdrawal of water. Our approach is to achieve milestones in our business by 
minimizing our water withdrawals. Also, in 2018, Target became a member of Ceres' Connect the Drops campaign and the 
California Water Action Collaborative.
We are currently working to understand Target’s position on water quality within our U.S. building operations.

Target values the richness of our natural world and seeks to protect biodiversity impacted by our operations, primarily  
through responsibly sourcing materials for our owned-brand products. To date, our work related to biodiversity has focused  
on reducing deforestation in our supply chain for palm oil and wood-based materials. We will evaluate other high-risk  
commodities as relevant, including soy, leather and rubber. 
We recognize as well that forests are not the only ecosystem under threat from commodity production and are working to 
identify how and where conversion of other types of natural habitat, like grasslands and savannahs, touches our supply chain. 
We have joined the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (USRSB) , and when the USRSB’s Sustainability Assessment  
Guidelines are finalized in 2019, we will begin reporting on our performance across indicators in four categories: animals, 
people, planet and profit. 
Other aspects of our work on protecting biodiversity include collaborations with Field to Market ®, Practical Farmers of Iowa  
and Sustainable Food Lab  on soil health, sourcing sustainably farmed or caught seafood in partnership with FishWise  and 
managing the use of neonicotinoid pesticides in landscaping on Target properties to protect pollinators. In 2018, we set out to 
understand where neonicotinoid insecticides are used on our grounds and landscaping. As of 2019, we require vendors that 
use neonics on Target’s properties to document the specific neonic used, reason for use, type of application and the Target 
location. We look to these data as the basis for ongoing work to develop best practices to manage neonic use.

Waste Minimization in Operations  
We conducted 25 waste-stream audits in 2018—19 stores, three regional distributions centers, two food distributions centers 
and one fulfillment center. This was a larger sample of stores than previous years, as we seek to better understand what is 
being sent to landfills. Stores were selected based on store type, volume, geography and trash volumes to try to obtain a 
representative sample of the full Target chain. Waste audit and other data combine to inform ongoing efforts to reduce waste. 
In 2018, Target successfully rolled out two programs to better track and reduce waste: 
• Cardboard RFID allows us to track store-level data for recycling volumes and report on metrics not previously possible. 
• A system-led disposition tool for food donations provides greater clarity to team members of what can and cannot be 
donated. 
Food Waste  
As we continue to expand our offerings in fresh food, we are also expanding programs to minimize food waste. We are getting 
perishables onto the sales floor sooner, extending their shelf life for our guests. We donated more than 89 million pounds  
of food (74 million meals) to Feeding America partners in 2018. We launched two data tools for store teams to help drive  
donations: A new Food Donations dashboard provides store-level donations data and compares locations to similar peers, 
and a system-led disposition tool provides guidance to team members of what can and cannot be donated. The combination 
of reporting and new technology led to a 16 percent increase in food donations from 2017 to 2018. 
For what cannot be donated, Target launched organics (compost) recycling programs at an additional 266 Target locations in

Product Collection & Recycling  
We want to make it easier for guests to sustainably dispose of items they no longer need and to adopt a circular economy 
mindset. Since we first invited guests to bring used car seats to their local Target store, we have collected more than half a  
million, generating 7.4 million pounds of recyclable car seat materials to date for transformation into new products. We also 
offer an electronic trade-in program  that is active all yearlong. And we are exploring options for other trade-in events for 
hard-to-recycle products. We continue to offer in-store recycling for plastic bags. And we are contributing to the demand for  
recycled materials in our sourcing of polyester and plastic packaging.

Effluents & Waste
Waste by type and disposal method 306-2 Retail Operations (Stores and Distribution Centers)  
We quantified the disposal method at the Target waste program level (i.e., landfill is assumed for all trash disposals, hazardous 
waste is generalized under the Environmentally Sensitive Item Management [ESIM] program, similarly with recycle and reuse). 
The ESIM program is designed to help identify, handle, manage and store environmentally sensitive items that require special 
handling based on federal and state laws.
Where our waste goes (U.S., in tons):
• Recycle: 553,294 
• Reuse: 173,027 
• ESIM Diverted: 2,578
• Landfills: 233,750 
In 2018, we:
• Supported the recycling of more than 9,000 tons of plastic (shrink, plastic bags, etc.)
• Recycled and diverted more than two million pounds of electronic waste was from landfills
• Helped guests trade in more than 7.4 million pounds of car seats through our trade-in program
Electronics Recycling—Five-Year History
• 2018: 1,475 tons
• 2017: 2,038 tons
• 2016: 3,168 tons
• 2015: 3,347 tons
• 2014: 4,427 tons
The above numbers are a consolidated total weight of electronic waste recycled through our operational and guest-facing  
recycling programs. To lower costs and increase salvage recovery, Target improved training for store operations team  
members to shift some materials that were going to electronics recycling into our salvage programs. 
Our long-standing diversion programs continue to show success: Since 1994, we have collected and reused over 8.1 billion 
plastic hangers used in our stores, saving them from landfills and saving millions in expense each year. In total, in 2018, we 
diverted 75.7 percent of our retail waste from landfills through salvage, donations, organics, reuse or recycling, up from 74.0 
percent in 2017. 
Diversion (U.S. stores) in tons: 
• Cardboard: 492,547
• Plastic Bags and Shrink Wrap: 9,921
• Plastic, Glass and Aluminum Cans and Bottles: 4,063
• Electronics Recycling: 1,475

Please note: We have changed the calculation of this figure from last year to better align with the GRI Standards and the

suppliers that were new; we are now reporting the percentage of new suppliers that are screened.
Negative environmental impacts in the 
supply chain and actions taken308-2 Target’s Standards of Vendor Engagement establishes standards to ensure our suppliers are compliant with environmental 
regulations. An example of this is our no tolerance standards for improperly managed wastewater treatment systems. In 2018, 
80 percent of violations found were remediated (four out of five total violations). One factory was removed from our supply 
chain by the vendor. In addition to our standards, we also have commitments for wastewater testing, efficient water use and 
energy efficiency where we are working directly with our manufacturing supply chain on performance-improvement programs 
such as the Vietnam Improvement Project and Clean by Design. Additionally, through our partnership with WWF, we engage 
the textile sector located in China's Taihu basin region  to reduce water risks in our supply chain and local communities.  
Collectively, these programs have trained more than 240 participants at 73 factories and 23 mills in 2018.

invested in our team members by giving them opportunities to grow professionally; to take care of themselves, each other and 
their families; and to make a difference for our guests and our communities. We offer industry-leading resources to our team  
members and their families to support them in their times of need.
We recognize the impact increased wages have on our team members’ ability to sustain financial stability and look after  
themselves and the people they love. That is why we have committed to a minimum hourly wage of $15 by the end of 2020.  
In 2019, we took the next step by moving to a $13 minimum hourly wage.

Labor Practices  
Target respects individual human rights in every aspect of our business globally, from our supply chain to our stores,  
headquarters, operations and business partnerships, because we believe every person deserves to be treated with dignity and 
respect. We expect every team member and every business partner that works with us to show respect for human rights and 
follow all laws that protect human rights, including those that prohibit forced or compulsory labor, child labor and human  
trafficking. We ensure safe working conditions, the freedom to choose whether or not to work and legal wage compensation 
for hours worked. Additionally, our Open Door Communications Policy encourages team members who have a job-related 
idea or concern to share with their leader. If a satisfactory resolution is not reached, team members can go to another  
higher-level leader within the organization or report their concerns to our Integrity Hotline.
Talent Recruitment  
We know that our talent is one of our greatest assets, and we continue to invest in our current and future team members. By 
providing a compelling work environment and meaningful experiences for our team members, we contribute to the growth of 
existing talent and the successful recruitment of future talent. Our recruiters and hiring managers work together to plan for  
talent needs and growth, connect in our communities and create robust talent pipelines. We leverage a wide variety of 
recruiting resources and source from diverse talent pools. Our teams study the market and workforce trends to understand, 
anticipate and plan for recruitment needs and actions.

At Target, we are committed to the safety of our team members, guests, vendors, visitors and contractors. We have specific 
safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce hazards at all of our locations. This includes administering a comprehensive 
and continuous occupational injury and illness prevention program for all team members. Target’s goal is to prevent  
occupational incidents, injuries and illnesses and to comply with all safety and health standards.
Going beyond safety, Target invests in our team members’ well-being in a number of innovative ways. Outside of our regular 
10 percent team member merchandise discount, we offer our team members 20 percent off all fresh and frozen fruits and  
vegetables, a selection of better-for-you food, athletic apparel and goods and tobacco-cessation products. Since the  
Wellness Discount began in 2015, our team members have saved more than $30 million on healthier options for themselves 
and their families. 
We continue to offer education assistance, flu shots, membership to our credit union and many other benefits to our team 
members, supporting their overall well-being. 
For team members enrolled in our medical benefits, we are focused on closing the health literacy gap that is prevalent across 
our country. We are supporting team members with new ways to help them understand benefits, insurance and how making 
healthy choices can contribute to slowing the increase in health expenses.

households. They can also receive free in-person counseling sessions and get help with things like day care, elder care,  
budgeting advice or access to community resources. And in some stores and distribution centers, we also offer on-site  
counselors to support team members' needs. In 2018 alone, we helped more than 110,000 team members get the support 
they needed.

There is a Target store within 10 miles of 75 percent of the U.S. population—and in order to win in retail, we need to reflect 
that population in our team to ensure we deliver the product, services, experiences and messages our guests need and want. 
At Target, we embrace diversity and inclusion and strive to give everyone access to the same opportunities. By creating equal 
opportunities for all, we can better understand and serve our guests, connect to the communities we serve and build a  
stronger team. Diversity & Inclusion is reflected in Target’s Strategic Road Map as one of five values: Inclusivity—embracing 
diversity and striving to give everyone access to the same opportunities.
We champion a more inclusive society through activating a broad ecosystem focused on:
• Creating an inclusive guest experience where all dimensions of difference are valued and represented and guests feel a 
sense of belonging at Target
• Having an inclusive work environment where all dimensions of difference are valued and represented, while all team  
members feel welcome and are able to bring their authenticity to deliver results
• Ensuring we have a diverse workforce where there is equity available in hiring, development and advancement regardless of 
team members' dimensions of difference
• Leveraging our influence to reduce disparities and champion societal impact in order to help communities thrive
Our ecosystem, in addition to supporting our entire strategy, is focused on:
• Ensuring our team equitably reflects the national qualified applicant pools within the communities we serve
• Equitably retaining and advancing our talented team
• Delivering an equitable experience for all team members
• Driving inclusive leadership and individual behavior
• Ongoing investment in diverse suppliers
• Continued outreach to multicultural audiences with relevant marketing messages
• Relevant assortments of products that meet the needs of the multicultural guest
To deliver our strategy, we have shared accountability across the organization for diversity and inclusion, including a dedicated 
Diversity & Inclusion team that orchestrates the diversity and inclusion strategy, helps set enterprise focuses, drives inclusion 
acumen and manages shared accountability across the organization, and an ecosystem of business-led diversity and  
inclusion owners, Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and external partners that are integrated throughout the business and

Operations and suppliers at significant risk 
for incidents of forced or compulsory labor409-1 We identify risk of forced labor through our responsible-sourcing audit process, audit history and a variety of risk-intelligence 
sources. We closely collaborate with NGOs and other brands to identify, mitigate and remediate these risks. If we find credible 
indicators of forced labor at any facility, we prioritize the well-being of the workers, which means that where possible, we  
strive to frame and implement a corrective action plan that will facilitate the remediation of the indicators and a continuation  
of the business relationship once remediation is complete. Only when remediation is not possible, we will work with the  
appropriate stakeholders to develop a responsible disengagement strategy and intend to mitigate additional harm to the  
workers. During the responsible-sourcing audit, personnel records are reviewed and the hiring process is discussed with  
management. Through this process, verification of established formal procedures ensuring review of age documentation, 
vetting of labor brokers and safeguarding of high-risk candidates is undertaken. Maintenance of standard personnel files for 
all workers where information is readily available is also confirmed. Finally, Target reviews that all facilities are upholding the 
Employer Pays Principle, reiterating the expectation that the costs of recruitment are paid by the employer—not the worker.  
A follow-up audit is conducted to ensure that a formal hiring process has been implemented.

For the fifth consecutive year, Target volunteers contributed more than one million hours of service in the communities where 
they live and work. Our team is encouraged to volunteer where it feels locally relevant and where they have passion. We 
continue to encourage participation in skills-based/pro bono community service across our team through team and individual

has stores, distribution centers, headquarters offices and a manufacturing supply chain presence. Donations include a mix of 
cash grants, in-kind products and leveraging our resources to build back communities stronger than before. Target’s Global 
Crisis Management team provides coordination of local leaders and headquarters' team members to respond to the needs of 
the team, store and community. Target provided more than $2.9 million to disaster response efforts in 2018.  
In addition, Target is a member of the Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program and donates $500,000 to ensure the  
American Red Cross can support all disasters large and small throughout the year.  
Target is concerned about food scarcity, as it impacts our teams and guests. In 2018, Target donated more than 89.2 million

Indonesia and Vietnam. The creation of community-based women’s EKATA groups was an integral component to the success 
of the three-year partnership. EKATA enables women workers to identify barriers to their rights and well-being and to take 
action to address those barriers such as through the implementation of awareness campaigns or the creation of worker-  
management forums through which women can raise concerns.

Target leverages our size, scale and influence to drive transparency and innovation across our entire value chain, operations

impacts of the products we sell while also working to make certain all families find products that reflect their diverse needs. 
One way we do this is via our commitment to purposeful brands. Also key to this approach is seeking to establish a culture 
and mindset around circular design and a zero-waste lifestyle. We are working with vendors, suppliers and other stakeholders 
to integrate circularity into our business—from product innovation to packaging considerations and store design. To learn more
