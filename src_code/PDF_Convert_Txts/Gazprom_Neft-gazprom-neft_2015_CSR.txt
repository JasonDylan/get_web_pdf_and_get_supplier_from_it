of its activities to solve economic, environmental  
and social problems in a strategic context.

www.gazprom-neft.comKey themes  
and aspects of information disclosure
When determining significant themes and the corresponding indicators, the Company took  
into consideration the provisions of the UN Global Compact, the Social Charter of Russian Business 
as well as the following standards and studies:
 ↗international and Russian standards in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainable 
development and non-financial report standards (ISO 26000, GRI–G4, G4 Sector Supplement);
 ↗studies on the industry-wide practice for the management of sustainable development  and reporting in this area;
 ↗an analysis of the scope of the Company’s stakeholder engagement.
The analysis of internal stakeholder engagement utilised surveys of Company employees (executives and specialists) conducted as part of the preparation of this Report, the results  of annual research on the social and psychological climate at the Company and the minutes  
of meetings between employees and management as well as workforce meetings. 
When identifying themes that are significant for external stakeholders, Gazprom Neft utilised 
materials from its regular interaction with investors, the federal and regional authorities, business 
partners, non-profit and public organisations, experts and local communities. Materials from roundtables that Gazprom Neft organises in the regions to inform stakeholders about  
the Company’s approaches and performance results in sustainable development  
were also employed. In 2015, special roundtable sessions were devoted to a discussion  of the Company’s sustainable development reporting. A detailed breakdown of these meetings  
is presented in Appendix 3. The Company also took into account the recommendations  
and comments it received as part of the public assurance of its 2014 Sustainability Report  by the Non-Financial Reporting Board of the RUIE. 
These measures made it possible to outline the range of themes that are significant in terms  
of the Company’s values and strategy as well as from the standpoint of stakeholders.The contents of the Report describe a range of significant themes and aspects  
that may be reasonably important for reflecting the Company’s impact on the economy, 
environment and society or influencing stakeholders.

Message from the Chairman of the Board of Directors
GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015The operational results achieved by Gazprom Neft during  
the difficult period for the global oil and gas industry in 2015 
once again confirmed that the Company has chosen the correct 
strategy as well as its competitiveness and sustainability.
Gazprom Neft increased hydrocarbon production by more  
than 20% to 79.7 million tonnes in the reporting year.  The Company continued to invest in its development  
while moving towards its declared strategic goal of reaching  
a production level of 100 million tonnes of hydrocarbons  by 2020.
The Company carried out work on major projects in 2015:  
the development of the Prirazlomnoye field  
as well as the Messoyakha and Kuyumba assets.  Construction was also completed on the Gates  of the Arctic terminal at the Novy Port field. 
The second stage of a large-scale programme to modernise oil 
refineries continued in 2015. The Company built up its presence 
in premium sales channels, expanded the geography of the jet 
fuel business and increased the volume of petroleum products sold via the Gazpromneft filling station network. 
In 2015, Gazprom Neft implemented a number of major 
environmental projects. Specifically, in September the Company 
launched the South Priobsky Gas Processing Plant, which 
will make a substantial contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The refinery’s ratio for extracting targeted 
components will exceed 95%, which is consistent with 
modern global requirements. The Moscow Oil Refinery began construction on the Biosphera biological treatment facilities. 
Thanks to its multi-tiered treatment system, water consumption 
by the Moscow Oil refinery will decrease 60%, and 75%  of the water will be recycled in the production cycle.Guided by its key priorities, the Company continues  to implement development and social support programmes  
for its personnel and ensure employees have safe and attractive working conditions.
Gazprom Neft is a responsible social investor that strives  
for positive long-term changes in the regions where it operates. In particular, the Company continued to actively develop 
the “Native Towns” social investments programme in 2015. 
The “Multiplying Talent” tournament on oil and gas themes was conducted for the first time and attended by more than 
1,200 schoolchildren from St Petersburg, Tyumen, Noyabrsk, 
Muravlenko, Novy Port and the village of Mys Kamenny.  The “DIY City” project laboratory began functioning in Omsk 
with the goal of training citizens to design socially significant 
initiatives for the development of the urban environment.  
Total investment by Gazprom Neft in the projects  
of the “Native Towns” programme totalled approximately 
RUB 4 billion in 2015.
The new year of 2016 poses new challenges to the Company. 
But I am confident that Gazprom Neft will continue  to successfully meet its strategic objectives and contribute 
to the development of the national economy, the oil and gas 
industry and the regions of operation.

Message from the Chairman of the Management Board
GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015The results of 2015 confirmed Gazprom Neft’s ability to adapt 
to changing macroeconomic conditions. The Company achieved 
significant results in all areas of its operations, increasing 
production volumes to record levels, strengthening its positions  
on sales markets, implementing a number of important innovative 
and environmental projects, and continuing the development  
of social investment programmes. 
Gazprom Neft celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 2015. 
Highlights of the anniversary year included the millionth tonne  
of oil produced at the Prirazlomnoye field and the completion  
of construction of the Gates of the Arctic oil loading terminal  
at the Novy Port field for year-round crude shipments.  
The Company also successfully completed the first stage  
of the study of Bazhenov formation reserves at the South Priobskoye field.
Key projects were implemented as part of a large-scale programme 
to modernise oil refineries. Reconstruction was completed on major 
production facilities at the Omsk Oil Refinery – a fuel oil advanced processing unit and primary oil refining unit. Gazprom Neft 
launched a project to develop catalyst production at the refinery. 
This project aims to ensure the country’s oil refining industry has the high-quality Russian-made products it needs to produce  
Euro-5 standard fuel. The Moscow Oil Refinery began construction  
on the Biosphera biological treatment facilities and also became the first Russian oil refinery to install an automated air quality 
monitoring system. These projects were all part of comprehensive 
work carried out by Gazprom Neft to improve environmental safety and protect natural resources. 
Gazprom Neft devoted special attention to innovative activities last 
year, which enabled the Company to increase production at mature 
fields, include previously unprofitable hard-to-recover reserves  
in development work and offer promising innovative products  
to the market. The Omsk Oil Refinery produced its first pilot batch of needle coke in 2015. Gazprom Neft polymer-bitumen materials 
were used to build experimental road sections in Kazakhstan, marking the first time they have been used outside of Russia. 
The Company has consistently increased supplies of high-tech 
Russian-made motor oils and lubricants to the domestic market. Agreements on phasing out imports of lubricant materials were 
concluded with the governments of several Russian regions  
in 2015. Testing of a new technology for the utilisation of associated  
petroleum gas was successfully carried out in Tomsk. 
The Company continued work to improve industrial  
and occupational safety levels. The “Goal – Zero: No Harm  
to People, Objects or the Environment” campaign launched  
in 2015 identifies an action plan for subsequent years.  
In order to achieve this goal, Gazprom Neft is carrying out  
a large-scale project to improve workplace safety culture  that not only encompasses employees but contracting 
organisation specialists as well. Such work enabled the Company to further solidify the trend of reduced incidents and injuries  
at work and improve these indicators compared with 2014. 
The employees of Gazprom Neft are the Company’s key resource, 
and the professional development of personnel is a strategic 
priority. In 2015, more than 80% of the Company’s employees  
took part in different educational programmes. The Company 
introduced a Knowledge and Innovation Management System  
that consolidates the Company’s intellectual potential  
and improves the effective distribution and application  
of knowledge. The Company opened a specialised Gazprom Neft 
department at Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas  
as part of its efforts to attract young specialists to the university, 
while recipients of the Company’s scholarships from Kurdistan 
began studying at St Petersburg State Mining University.  
Gazprom Neft ranked first in a rating of Russian employers  
in 2015 according to the Headhunter.ru portal.
The Company actively developed programmes to support  
the socioeconomic development of the regions where  
it operates and improve the quality of life of local communities.  
The “Native Towns” social investment programme encompassed  
34 regions, where a total of 450 projects were implemented.  
This work resulted in local communities being more proactive  
in resolving regional development issues. A total of 379 projects 
were submitted as part of the Gazprom Neft grant competition  
for social initiatives in 2015.
In 2016, Gazprom Neft will continue to develop in accordance  
with its strategic priorities. The Company’s strategic advantages, 
key resources and professional team will enable it to confidently 
move forward while remaining one of the leaders in the industry, 
an attractive employer and a responsible social investor.

PERFORMANCE  
AND INNOVATIVE  
DEVELOPMENT
Gazprom Neft is progressing steadily towards its long-term 
goals and demonstrating stable growth in its production  and operating performance: each year the Company increases the volume of proven reserves, hydrocarbon production  and sales of petroleum products via premium sales channels while also maintaining refining volumes. The actions undertaken by the Company to develop its business in 2015 were consistent 
with the long-term plans, development priorities and goals set forth in the corporate 
strategy. Particular attention was devoted to the introduction of new production 
technologies in the Company’s traditional regions, the implementation of strategic projects in the northern Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District and projects to develop the Arctic 
shelf, modernise oil refineries and develop the sales business.
The current economic situation is a significant factor for the Company and may require local changes  
such as an adjustment to the project implementation schedule and sequence. The Company concedes  that short-term priorities may be displaced in favour of projects with short payback periods and projects 
that generate a positive cash flow in the medium term. However, the key long-term goals of Gazprom Neft remain important, attainable and unchanged. The strategy pursued by Gazprom Neft demonstratives  
its resilience to changes in the external environment.KEY CHANGES TO GAZPROM NEFT’S STRATEGIC VISION IN 2015-2016

In 2015, Gazprom Neft maintained its positions among Russian oil companies  
as an industry leader in terms of oil and gas production. Commercial hydrocarbon 
production increased 20.3% to 79.7 million TOE compared with 2014.
These results are due to:

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015In 2015, Gazprom Neft, SIBUR and Kazakhstan Road Research Institute (KRRI) signed an agreement  
on the use of polymer bitumen materials in the road industry of Kazakhstan. As part of this cooperation, two experimental road sections were built outside of Russia for the first time using polymer-bitumen 
binders (PBB) produced by the Company. These materials have better quality indicators compared with 
traditional bitumen: increased resistance to deformation, improved properties at high and low temperatures and increased resistance to aging. During the road operation process, the parties will analyse the condition of the roadbed to compare the surface conditions using PBB and traditional bitumen. The monitoring 
results will demonstrate the advantages of using PBB on motorways with high traffic intensity and in harsh 
climatic conditions and helped draft requirements for binders taking into account the experience  of their use in Kazakhstan.AGREEMENT ON COOPERATION
“ Gazprom Neft is one  
of the leaders in bitumen 
production and sales in Russia and Kazakhstan. We are consistently working to build long-term partnership relations with the consumers of our products and the government authorities in all regions of operation. 
Cooperation with Kazakhstan 
Road Research Institute  
is an important step towards applying the newest technologies in road construction in the country.

www.gazprom-neft.comInnovation
One of the priorities for Gazprom Neft’s innovative development is technology  
that ensures the strategic goals of increasing production and enhancing 
the technological efficiency of oil refining. The Company has introduced  
a long-term technological planning system that identifies long-term  
technological challenges and the solutions needed to deal with them. 
INNOVATIONS IN EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
Gazprom Neft has employed a Technological Strategy for Exploration and Development since 2014 
that summarises the Company’s technological challenges. The Technology Strategy consists of nine 
long-term technological development programmes that include projects with specific implementation 
periods and the anticipated results.
The Exploration and Production Unit launched five long-term programmes in 2015 and plans  
to launch the other four programmes in 2016. The most important decisions under the Strategy  
are adopted by the Management Committee chaired by the Company’s first deputy CEO.  
The Technologies Committee handles the monitoring of project implementation. 
The main projects to be implemented under the Technological Strategy for Exploration  
and Development are: the inclusion of hard-to-recover and unconventional reserves in development 
work, chemical-based enhanced oil recovery methods, the utilisation of associated petroleum gas, the substitution of technological equipment imports and the development of integrated conceptual 
design tools.
INCLUSION OF UNCONVENTIONAL RESERVES IN DEVELOPMENT WORK  
AND HARD-TO-RECOVER RESERVES // 
RESULTS OF 2015: Production using high-tech wells (horizontal wells, including multi-stage hydraulic 
fracturing) exceeded 11 million TOE. The first stage of the study of the Bazhenov formation  
at the South Priobskoye field was completed and confirmed the existence of mobile oil reserves. 
After hydraulic fracturing operations were performed at all the wells, a flow of hydrocarbons  
was obtained with varying intensity. In addition to Gazpromneft-STC, the other participants  
in the programme are the Engineering Centre of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University), Lomonosov Moscow State University, Gubkin Russian State University of Oil  
and Gas, and Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology.
At the Priobskoye field, LLC Gazpromneft-Khantos has introduced innovative non-spherical hydraulic 
fracturing technology that eliminates restrictions on the number of stages in a single bore.  
This technology will enable the Company to develop additional hard-to-recover reserves. 
The drilling of the first horizontal well has been completed at the Novy Port oil and gas condensate 
field with horizontal shafts of 1,000 metres. This marks the first time a dual well has been drilled  
in Arctic conditions. The drilling of extra-long dual wells intensifies hydrocarbon production  
while simultaneously reducing infrastructure costs.“ In 2015, Gazpromneft-Khantos 
was faced with a serious technological challenge  
at the South Priobskoye field.  
The difficult geological structure of perspective boundary deposits of the asset and, as a result,  
the extremely low reservoir properties of the oil containing 
reservoir rocks meant  
the traditional approaches  
to the development  
of such reserves would be 
economically inefficient.  
Taking into account the projected growth in the proportion  
of this category of reserves  
in the enterprise’s annual production to 80%  
by 2018, only the selection  
and introduction of the latest  
drilling and extraction technologies combined  
with the maximum cost  
reduction in related materials  
and equipment may maintain  
the asset’s current level  
of production in an economically efficient manner. Utilising  
the specialised functions  
of the Upstream Division, we have formed a long-term strategy to search for and test the latest oil production methods and technologies from low-permeability reservoirs,  
which will not only result  
in the individual selection  
of the best method for developing the boundaries of the Priobskoye asset’s sections from an economic standpoint and a scientifically substantiated approach  
for selecting the production method for fields with difficult  
geological conditions ”.

RESULTS OF 2015: Gazpromneft-NNG has successfully completed 
the first stage of testing at the Vyngapurovskoye field  
on the first Russian rotary-controlled system produced  
by OJSC Elektropribor State Research Centre Concern. CHEMICAL-BASED ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY 
METHODS //
RESULTS OF 2015: In the second half of 2015, Salym Petroleum 
Development completed the installation of equipment  
and began pumping into injection wells as part of a pilot 
alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding project.  ASP has the potential to increase oil yield through the process  
of chemically flooding a reservoir with a ternary mixture 
(consisting of anionic surfactant polymers, soda and polymer). 
INTEGRATED CONCEPTUAL DESIGN TOOLS //
RESULTS OF 2015: A software module called  
“Surface Infrastructure Development” is being developed  
and its introduction will help to improve the economic efficiency 
of projects by optimising the infrastructure development  
of multiple well platforms and in-field communications.UTILISATION OF ASSOCIATED PETROLEUM GAS //
RESULTS OF 2015: In September 2015, Gazprom Neft and SIBUR 
launched the commercial operation of the South Priobsky Gas 
Processing Plant with production capacity of more than  
900 million m3 of associated petroleum gas. Due to the launch  
of the new production facility, the utilisation of APG produced 
at the South Priobskoye field reached the required level of 95%, 
thus making it possible to significantly increase the economic efficiency of this asset’s development.The Company has successfully completed the pilot testing of innovative soft steam reforming technology to process associated petroleum gas developed by the Boreskov Catalysis 
Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy  
of Sciences. The new technology is recommended  
for introduction at the Company’s enterprises in order  
to enhance the utilisation of associated petroleum gas  
at small and remote fields.One method for enhancing oil recovery efficiency that is commonly 
used in Russia is flooding where water is employed as a displacing agent. Pumped into the subsoil resources via special injection 
wells, the water pushes the oil towards the production wells acting 
as a kind of piston. 
The efficiency of the process can be enhanced additionally  
by pumping special solutions into the formation, which include 
surfactants that flush away the residual oil by reducing surface tension at the boundaries with the rock and the water  as well as a thickening agent – a polymer that allows  for levelling out the injection front and increasing the sweep.FLOODING METHOD
Associated petroleum gas is an integral component of oil production at almost all fields. In order to increase the APG usage level, Gazprom Neft  
is implementing a number of projects that will make it possible to efficiently process it directly in the regions of production. One of the most commonly used gas treatment technologies is the low-temperature separation of APG into natural gas liquids (NGL), dry stripped gas and natural petrol. The petrol 
can then be used as fuel or gas and pumped into a pipeline, while NGL is used as a raw material for the petrochemical industry. 
However, the construction of a gas processing plant and infrastructure to transport NGL is a project that would only be economically justified  
if significant volumes of APG are utilised. Cost-effective processing methods such as soft steam reforming technology are needed for small amounts  
of raw materials. Such technology makes it possible to convert the NGL contained in APG into methane and obtain a gas that is suitable for use  
in the power industry and gas pipeline transportation. GAS TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY

RESULTS OF 2015: Grade A needle coke has been produced  
at the Omsk Oil Refinery for the first time in Russia. 
Gazpromneft-Lubricants and Gazpromneft-Bitumen Materials 
have developed and launched a number of new products that meet current government standards and customer needs.
IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLINESS  
OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS //
RESULTS OF 2015: The Moscow Oil Refinery launched construction 
on the Biosphera biological treatment facilities.  
The Biosphera complex will use a final water purification technology that is unique to the Russian oil refining industry and removes 99% of contaminants. The use of a multi-stage 
biological treatment system will enable the plant to reduce water 
consumption by 60%, while 75% of the water will be recycled  
into the enterprise’s production cycle. The launch  
of the Biosphera complex is planned for 2017. 
The Company and the Topchiyev Institute of Petrochemical 
Synthesis of the Russian Academy of Sciences are jointly building  
a pilot plant to produce solid acid alkylation – a new technology 
that ensures the environmental friendliness of the production 
process and has no effective analogues. 
The Moscow Oil Refinery reduced water consumption per unit  
of the refinery’s equivalent distillation productivity by 6% in 2015 
and increased the use of recycled water by 4.5 million m
3.  
The growth in the share of recycled water enables the enterprise 
to consistently reduce its environmental impact through an active 
decrease in fresh water consumption.Priorities in the oil refining segment include increasing refining 
depth, releasing new products and improving the environmental friendliness of the production process. 
INCREASING THE REFINING DEPTH AND PRODUCTION 
MARGIN // 
RESULTS OF 2015: The Omsk Oil Refinery began implementing 
the “Aluminium Oxide-Based Crude Deep Conversion Catalysts” 
project. The project aims to provide the Russian oil refining 
industry with modern catalytic cracking catalysts  and hydrogenation processes that are used in the production  
of the highest environmental friendly standard Euro-5.
Production facilities for cracking and hydrogenation  
process catalysts are to be built as part of the project  
at the Omsk Oil Refinery. R&D for the catalytic cracking  
catalysts is being performed jointly with the Institute  
of Hydrocarbon Processing Problems of the Siberian Branch  
of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The hydrogenation  
process catalysts are being developed in a partnership  
with the Boreskov Catalysis Institute of the Siberian Branch  
of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The first Russian-made 
diesel-based hydrotreatment catalyst was developed  
as part of a general cooperation agreement  
with the Boreskov Catalysis Institute concluded in April 2015. Following the completion of industrial testing, the catalyst  
is to be introduced at the Company’s oil refining enterprises.
Gazprom Neft is currently the only oil and gas company  
 in the CIS that has its own catalytic cracking catalysts.  
The Company and the Boreskov Catalysis Institute jointly take 
part in a Federal Target Programme for the development  
of hydroprocessing catalysts as part of alternative substitution programmes. The work will result in new brands of domestic hydrocracking catalysts, hydrotreatment and new types  
of zeolites (the basis for the production of catalyst components).INNOVATIONS IN REFINING
The widespread use of catalytic hydrotreatment and hydrocracking processes in modern oil refining is driven by the growing environmental 
requirements for the quality of petroleum products manufactured by refineries. Motor fuel-based hydrotreatment technology is used to remove sulphur and nitrogen compounds, which ultimately reduces the environmental impact of road transport. The hydrocracking process makes it possible 
to obtain a wide range of high-quality motor fuels, including from raw materials that had previously been used solely for the production of dark 
petroleum products.HYDROTREATMENT AND HYDROCRACKING

work/rendering services, the reliability of the counterparty,  
its relevant technical and personal resources as regards  
the purchase of work/services and the necessary experience  
in performing such work/rendering such services  
for the corresponding area. One of the key criteriafor  
selecting a counterparty for work/services is the counterparty’s compliance with the HSE, OS and CD rules adopted  
by the Company. The Company concludes agreements  
with the selected counterparties on HSE, OS and CD  
containing requirements on compliance with the Company’s standards in industrial and environmental safety.Supply chain

UNTIL 2025CREATION  
OF VALUEBUSINESS 
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
The volume of hydrocarbons extracted by the Company increases 
each year, thereby making it possible to meet the market’s demand for oil and gas. The growth in production can be attributed to the large-scale development and introduction of innovations.  The Company has increased production at mature fields in Western Siberia and introduced a new brand of Arctic crude oil – ARCO –  to the international market from the Prirazlamnoye and Novy Port fields. Gazprom Neft continues to study opportunities to extract hard-to-recover and unconventional reserves. A balanced project portfolio helps to effectively manage production in rapidly changing market conditions.
SALES
The Company has a reliable high-margin sales network to sell 
petroleum products to industrial consumers and motor fuel via retail and small wholesale channels. Gazprom Neft has separated the following premium businesses: the sale of jet fuel, lubricants, 
bituminous materials and petrochemical products  
as well as bunkering. REFINING
The Company refines roughly 80% of the crude oil it extracts  
and remains one of the industry leaders in this regard while reliably 
meeting the demands of the domestic market. The high proportion of refining is a significant factor in ensuring the Company’s economic efficiency. The Company achieves such results by continuously improving its operating efficiency, modernising oil refineries  
and implementing projects to increase the depth of refining  
and produce light petroleum products. Production facility modernisation programmes enable the Company to not only enhance the quality of its products, but also improve the environmental performance of motor fuels as well as minimise the environmental impact of its refineries. One promising area  
for the Company’s development is the design  
of innovative catalysts and processes  
for processing raw hydrocarbons.Meeting the needs  of customers for oil, gas and high-quality petroleum products

In order to achieve these goals, Gazprom Neft strives 
to employ the most cost-effective methods to recover the remaining reserves from the current resource base by utilising the best practices for optimising field development, reducing the cost of proven technologies as well as acquiring and introducing new technologies. The Company plans to set up a new production centre in the northern YNAD and is considering unconventional reserves as significant potential for growth. 
In the long term, the Company’s own sales channels should sell 100% of the petroleum products manufactured at its oil refineries in Russia  for the maximum coverage of the value chain  in the oil business.
In the motor fuel segment, Gazprom Neft intends  
to increase overall sales in Russia and the CIS by 2025  as a result of 20% growth in the retail sales channel.  The Company plans to expand its filling station network in Russia and the CIS to achieve this goal.
In the segment for the sale of petroleum products  
to industrial consumers, the Company is targeting a 30% increase in petroleum product sales by 2025. Gazprom Neft will continue modernising refining facilities and work to further enhance operational efficiency  and implement projects to increase the depth of refining and manufacture light petroleum products using facilities in the Russian Federation. 
Gazprom Neft plans to complete construction on a new 
catalyst production facility and start manufacturing cracking and hydroprocessing catalysts.
In R&D, the Company intends to introduce the high 
performance results of its own R&D projects into actual production.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN RESOURCES
Successfully achieving the Company's strategic goals largely depends 
on the efforts and abilities of key employees, including skilled technical personnel. The inability to recruit personnel and/or retain existing personnel with the necessary skills and experience could have  
a negative effect on the Company's appeal as an employer. Factors that increase HR risks include a growing shortage of skilled specialists and, as a consequence, increased competition on the labour market  
in Russia and abroad.Gazprom Neft offers competitive remuneration, including a salary, performance-based bonuses and a social benefits package. The Company develops and implements programmes to establish a talent pool  
as well as train and develop personnel which aim to meet its demand  
for qualified staff both now and in the future. 
Gazprom Neft is improving its recruitment procedures and undertaking 
measures to reduce staff turnover and encourage staff to realize their potential.
The Company implements social investment programmes in its regions  
of operation that aim to improve the quality of life of employees and their 
families, among other things.
RISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRIAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
The Group is exposed to risks relating to the safety of its employees 
and their operations. Such risks may arise as a result of equipment damage and failure, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or the actions or inaction of personnel. Any of these risks could have a materially adverse effect on the business, financial situation, operating results  
or reputation of Gazprom Neft.Gazprom Neft strives to provide a safe working environment for its employees and seeks to avoid injury or death, actions brought against the Group or damage to its business reputation. The Company constantly monitors safety threats, and pays particular attention to complying  
with safety equipment regulations.
ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
Gazprom Neft’s operations carry an inherent risk of environmental 
damage or pollution, which may lead to civil liability and require action to mitigate such damage. Environmental risks and expenses related to compliance with environmental requirements or commitments may increase in the future as the Company’s production activities  
and assets expand.The Company is fully aware of its responsibility to the public for creating safe working conditions and protecting the natural environment.  
Gazprom Neft ensures compliance with environmental protection standards and also monitors changes in environmental legislation in the various countries in which it operates.

 ↗Corporate profit and property tax rates were reduced for manufacturers of oil refining catalysts.RESULTS OF REGIONAL LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE WORK //
Gazprom Neft was the first Russian oil company to protect its 
geological reserves using the new State Expert Evaluation arrangement. A pilot project was implemented for the Tsarichanskoye, Kapitonovskoye 
and Verkhne-Salymskoye fields. The new classification of reserves reduces the time required to approve  
reserves and draft solutions from 22 months to 14 months 
and gradually transition from managing resources to managing  
the economic efficiency of their extraction.NEW STATE EXPERT EVALUATION SCHEMEThe Company also took part  
in the formation of a number  of regional legislative initiatives in 2015. 
VADIM YAKOVLEV 
First Deputy CEO of Gazprom Neft
“ The use of the new State Expert Evaluation arrangement for reserves  
will not only improve the efficient management of the geological 
exploration and production process within Gazprom Neft but also facilitate the Company’s interaction with controlling bodies. We support and are actively involved in improving expert evaluation mechanisms, which is essential for the successful development of Gazprom Neft

ENGAGEMENT MECHANISMS: 
 ↗social projects as part of the “Native Towns” social investment programme;

where it operates and improvements to the quality of life of the local population;
 ↗transparency of the Company’s activities and decisions;
 ↗the Company’s financial stability;

The results of dialogues with local communities and studies of the social climate in these areas serve as the foundation for the development of the Company’s social projects. Gazprom Neft 
strives to involve the local population in their implementation since it views the social activity  
of local communities as an essential factor for regional development. To achieve this objective,  the Company develops such social investment formats as grant competitions for social initiatives.
In order to generate awareness about its activities and collect comments and suggestions,  
the Company has developed the practice of holding dialogues and roundtables with local 
communities in the regions. Public hearings are also a key mechanism of engagement  
when developing and implementing production projects. When planning activities in regions  where indigenous peoples of northern Russia reside, the Company seeks to ensure a balance 
between the interests of indigenous peoples and the implementation of its strategy.  
The Company develops and discusses mechanisms with indigenous peoples of northern Russia  to minimise the effects of its industrial impact on their traditional way of life and carries out 
programmes that aim to support the traditional way of life of indigenous peoples of northern 
Russia and their families.Some of the key tools of this dialogue include Gazprom Neft conferences for customers  
and distributors, off-site meetings and fact-finding missions during which future customer  
and clients that already cooperate with the Company can see the production process in person, study products in detail and discuss important issues.

of the exploration, production and processing of oil and gas. Gazprom Neft and Skolkovo will provide 
comprehensive support to domestic technological developments for the oil and gas industry  
and will also promote the establishment and introduction of high-tech products and technologies.

www.gazprom-neft.comCorporate culture
Gazprom Neft’s corporate culture is formed based on the Company’s 
values of integrity, leadership, mutual respect, trust, a winning 
attitude and a responsible owner. The focuses and objectives  
of the corporate culture are determined by the Company’s strategy 
and the challenges faced by the oil industry based on which 
Gazprom Neft develops a cultural model for rules and results  
that aims to boost motivation for achieving ambitious goals  
and maintain high industrial and environmental safety levels. 
In order to assess the development level of corporate culture  
and the social and psychological climate at the Company,  
Gazprom Neft conducts a study each year to evaluate the degree  
of involvement and loyalty of employees as well as the effectiveness 
of motivation, awareness and initiative support systems and also 
to identify potential areas for improvements. The information 
obtained from this study serves as the basis for planning activities in personnel management and corporate communications and may 
be used as an argument for adopting management decisions. Over the four years of systematic work in this area, the Company has 
managed to achieve significant growth in all the key indicators  
it studied. Satisfaction with the motivation system was up 35%  
in 2015 compared with 2012, involvement – 27%, loyalty – 23%  
and trust in management – 22%.  
In order to involve employees in strengthening and developing  
the corporate culture, the Company implements a number  
of projects and programmes that target different categories  
of employees, including adaptation programmes for new specialists, 
an organised coaching system, a non-financial motivation 
programme, a programme to select the best employees, internal 
competitions between departments and enterprises, and work  
with contractors. Adherence to corporate values is included  
in the system used to regularly assess the work of employees.
Internal corporate communications
The internal corporate communications system supports  
the corporate culture and dialogue with employees. In order  
for the communications system to reach 100% of employees,  
the Company employs a broad range of formats and tools –  
from organising conferences and production competitions 
to setting up discussion platforms on its intranet portal and 
developing multimedia content and educational infographics. 
Internal corporate communication tools:  
 ↗the unified system of intranet portals of Gazprom Neft 
enterprises to which more than 28,000 employees have 
access;
 ↗corporate media (Siberian Oil corporate magazine,  
the Neftegazeta periodical and its versions issued 
by subsidiaries and the corporate radio stations  
of Gazpromneft-Aero and the Omsk  and Moscow Oil Refinery);
 ↗meetings between management and the workforce;
 ↗a corporate forum;
 ↗a system of television screens; 
 ↗discussion platforms (conferences, roundtables); 
 ↗a feedback system.Meetings between the management of the Company’s enterprises and their workforces are an essential communication tool.  
A large portion of each meeting is devoted to answers to questions from employees. Information bulletins are published based  
on the meetings and distributed throughout the enterprise.  
The Company employs a system to handle feedback and inquiries and adapts the tools of this system to the specific operations  
of each enterprise. Feedback channels include boxes, email, sections 
in the intranet portals, an HR hotline, meetings with management 
and forums attended by all employee groups. Responses  
to inquiries are published in the Company’s corporate media.
The primary focus in the development of the internal corporate communications system in 2015 was the localisation  
of communications – the development of tools to interact  
with the workforces of subsidiaries using a unified method  
as well as the opportunities provided by corporate media.  
The format of the Neftegazeta periodical was altered as part  
of these activities. Now the corporate newspaper publishes localised versions for specific enterprises that include a general 
corporate section, materials about specific production units  
and local columns about each enterprise.

www.gazprom-neft.comGazprom Neft develops programmes to train company coaches and experts as part of efforts  
to achieve a synergistic effect. In 2015, more than 20 of the Company’s experts underwent special 
training and became instructors, and over 150 professional and technical courses were developed 
and introduced. To improve the practical component of training, Gazprom Neft opened new training classrooms at its Professional Growth Centre in St Petersburg, invested  
in the development of training platforms at partnering higher and secondary educational 
institutions, and introduced modern training methods such as online courses, technology  transfer sessions and multimedia 3D models to train field personnel, among other things.
“PROconcept”, a new course of the “PROmovement” integrated programme, was launched  
for specialists working at field development and construction projects in 2015. The course aims 
to develop design skills at the conceptual design level. The instructors included outside experts, 
managers and experienced specialists from the Upstream Division.
The Upstream Division launched the “Foreman School” line production manager training 
programme in 2015. The goal of the programme is to enhance the professionalism of foremen  
and share the experience of highly skilled employees with new and prospective colleagues, 
including to facilitate the development of succession candidates from among the staff. Foremen 
underwent training in industrial safety, production improvements, the foundations of company economics and finances, team management, production technologies and hydrocarbon treatment. 
The Professional Growth Centre of the Upstream Division opened at the Gazprom Neft Scientific  
and Technical Centre in the reporting year as part of the continuation of the Expert Evaluation Centre 
project that was launched in 2013. More than 3,000 employees from all the Company’s enterprises have 
undergone training over the three years of existence of the Upstream Division’s educational centre. 
The Professional Growth Centre’s goal is to accumulate and transfer the necessary technical knowledge 
to the Upstream Division’s employees to provide them with opportunities for continuous professional 
growth and development. To this end, the Centre engages in cooperation with key Russian and foreign 
universities, international professional communities and leading service organisations. The catalogue

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015The Company has a Corporate Management Academy that develops management and leadership 
skills among employees in a centralised and systematic manner. In 2015, the academy employed 
five module-based programmes for specialists of various levels – from line managers to senior 
executives. Gazprom Neft also develops and implements targeted programmes to solve urgent problems and achieve its strategic goals. For example, the Downstream Division launched  
the “Top Drive 2.0” programme in the reporting year to support the reorganisation of the regional sales model that began in 2013. The “Top Drive 2.0” programme was a continuation  of the “Top Drive” programme that the Company developed jointly with the Stockholm  
School of Economics and Ernst & Young and targets managers of the Regional Sales Directorate.  
The training plan is compiled in accordance with the specifics of the sales unit and includes international experience from solving relevant business tasks based on best practices. 
In 2015, the Company continued developing an organised coaching project and applying  
 it at subsidiaries. As part of the project, managers learn non-directive coaching management 
skills – leadership that motivates employees to find solutions on their own. Training activities  
for management teams were carried out at a number of subsidiaries of the Upstream  
and Downstream Divisions. The Company also drafted a corporate training programme  
on non-directive management methods that enables managers to expand the arsenal  
of management methods they employ. Forty-two people underwent pilot training in 2015.  
The programme was incorporated into the corporate training matrix starting in 2016.
The Downstream Division developed an integration programme called “ Boost” in 2015.  
“Boost” will encompass the maximum number of staff changes and support employees  
over their entire career path: hiring, promotion, moving to another region, undertaking  
a new role or functionality and lateral movement. The programme was established as a designer  
of adaptive tools that are grouped into four key sections: work environment, organisational  environmental, professional context and management context.
The principle of the designer and module-based construction makes it possible in each case  
to select tools taking into account the individual conditions for integration, which helps employees  
to achieve a high level of efficiency in as short a time as possible in the event of changes  to their professional status. The main goal of the programme is to provide information support  to personnel in terms of understanding the tasks, strategy and mutual influence  
of the Division’s business areas on overall efficiency.“BOOST ” INTEGRATION PROGRAMME42  people

www.gazprom-neft.comThe Company launched a project in 2015 to establish the corporate Knowledge and Innovation 
Management System (KIMS). The system ensures greater efficiency in the creation, preservation, 
dissemination and application of valuable knowledge for Gazprom Neft and expands  
the involvement of internal intellectual resources. 
A key resource for the KIMS was the Knowledge Portal, which integrates different tools  
and formats to store and exchange knowledge. The primary objectives of the KIMS  are to form communities of skilled workers and social learning. As part of the KIMS, the Knowledge 
Dissemination System (KDS) of the Scientific and Technical Centre and the I.D.E.A. project  
(a collection of initiatives to optimise business processes) were launched. Much of the KDS  is devoted to disseminating the best practices among Gazprom Neft subsidiary enterprises.  
The “Regional Centres of Excellence” and “Technical Solution Library” sections were established  
for this purpose. As part of the Knowledge Portal, the Company also launched the “Supply Academy” programme, which aims to develop professional skills among employees  
of the Procurements Office and prospective students from higher educational institutions.
The Company actively developed distance learning as an effective tool for transferring knowledge 
in the reporting year. Fifteen interactive online courses were developed for business needs in 2015. 
The Knowledge Portal offered employees more than 70 internal interactive courses and more  than 450 business training courses using the Eduson platform as of the end of 2015.  
The Company’s employees underwent 15,521 distance learning courses over the course

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015Development of the talent pool 
Meetings of the Talent Committee – collective meetings  
of management teams – are a key tool in selecting candidates 
for the talent pool. Specialist candidates are considered based 
on the results of an annual evaluation of their activities  
and potential. In 2015, the Talent Committee considered  
the talent pool for production and corporate functions as part  
of the development of the functional management model. 
The approach to forming the talent pool was extended  
to the Company’s subsidiaries in the reporting year.  
The Talent Committee held seven meetings to form local talent 
pools at the following subsidiaries: Moscow Oil Refinery,  
Gazpromneft-Logistics, Gazpromneft-Lubricants,  
Gazpromneft-STC, Gazprom Neft Shelf, Gazpromneft-Khantos and Gazpromneft-Angara. In 2016, the Talent Committee plans  
to hold meetings at a minimum of ten subsidiaries.
The work performed in 2015 resulted in the identification  
of 987 key positions and the approval of 1,890 succession 
candidates. More than 290 passed assessments based  
on which individual plans for their growth at the Company  
were created. 
In 2015, the Downstream Division launched the “Growth” career 
portal at which all employees can provide information about themselves and their professional skills, comment on their 
strengths as specialists, their vision for their career development 
and their desire to develop professionally. The portal allows employees to select career paths within a professional cluster, 
undergo an initial assessment for compliance with corporate  
and professional skills and receive recommendations  
from a manager and HR specialist based on the results  
for their professional development depending on the selected 
path. The “Growth” portal is integrated into the existing talent pool system, the professional cluster and career path system, 
performance evaluation and recruitment.In order to provide a talent pool for the present and the future, Gazprom Neft develops 
a workforce capacity system that includes vocational guidance with high school students, 
targeted education at higher and secondary educational institutions and a system  
to recruit and provide career planning for employees with high potential (including young 
professionals). 
In 2015, the Company developed a programme  
to hire experienced personnel at the new Messoyakha  
and Novy Port fields in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District, 
which are to open in 2016. Per the Company’s HR policy,  
priority was given to internal resources – employees  
of Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegaz and Gazpromneft-Muravlenko –  
when recruiting the team. The Yamal fields are to be developed 
by more than 110 specialists in shifts. This will provide employees 
of these enterprises an opportunity for career and professional 
growth. The specialists will be able to acquire unique skills  
and knowledge at the new sites. STAFF RECRUITMENT PROGRAMME

and young professionals
The Company has been implementing a new concept for cooperation with educational 
institutions since 2014. The concept aims to support the Company’s innovative development 
and focuses on the demand for personnel from enterprises as well as the Company’s needs  
for specialists with key professional skills. The new concept entails creating targeted 
educational programmes in accordance with the Company's objectives and involving  
Gazprom Neft experts in the educational process.
New master’s programmes were launched at the Company’s partnering universities  
in the reporting year: “Industrial and Civil Construction at Oil Production Facilities”  
at Tyumen State University of Civil Engineering and the programme “Mathematical Modelling  
of Oil Production Processes” at St Petersburg Polytechnic University. Gazprom Neft also 
opened a specialised department “Increased Oil Recovery Technologies for Facilities  The Company cooperates with leading universities in the industries of the regions  
where it operates. This joint work aims to provide targeted training for students,  
improve the skills of instructors and the quality of educational programmes and support 
talented students. 
A key tool in the transition to the system of training Company specialists based on the “School – 
Secondary Specialised College/University – Enterprise ” programme was the establishment  
of a Gazprom Neft specialised department at Omsk State Technical University. The specialised department 
has utilised an applied baccalaureate programme in the “ machines and chemical production devices ”  
and “chemical technology of natural energy and carbon materials ” specialisations since 2014.  
Applied baccalaureate programmes in the “ management in process systems ” specialisation and a master’s 
programme in the “ automation of technological production processes ” specialisation were launched  
at a specialised department of Omsk State Technical University in 2015. Students study oil refining 
processes at the Omsk Oil Refinery, both in theory and in practice. A training area and multi-functional resource centre equipped with laboratory equipment were set up within the enterprise for this purpose. Students get to see machinery and technologies in action and manage oil refining processes on computer simulators. “SECONDARY SPECIALIZED EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION/UNIVERSITY – ENTERPRISE ” PROGRAMMERECRUITING GRADUATES

INDUSTRIAL  
AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY, OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY, ENERGY EFFICIENCY  
AND ENERGY CONSERVATION
Improving occupational health and safety levels and reducing 
the risk of a negative environmental impact are strategic goals for the Company. Gazprom Neft is committed to becoming one of the leading global oil companies in terms of industrial, environmental and occupational safety and continuously works to improve its activities in these areas. Policy and management  
Gazprom Neft is guided in its work by the requirements of Russian legislation  
as well as international and corporate standards in HSE, OS and CD. The underlying  
corporate document that defines the Company’s operating principles and commitments  
is the Industrial, Fire, Transport, Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety,  and Civil Defence Policy
1. The policy is in effect at all subsidiaries and describes  
the uniformity of their strategic goals, obligations and responsibilities in HSE, OS and CD.
All the Company’s enterprises have a management system in matters of HSE, OS and CD  
that complies with the international standards OHSAS 18001:2007 and ISO 14001:2004.  
Due to the need to further enhance safety levels in 2015, Gazprom Neft continued reorganising its 
HSE, OS, and CD management system. New structures were established within the Upstream  and Downstream Divisions. This reorganisation will improve the efficiency of operational tasks  
as well as identifying and minimising safety risks. The Company ensures the transparency  
of corporate policies and performance results in such matters. The annual Sustainability Reports highlight the Company’s approaches to management and specific performance indicators. Starting 
from 2007, this information has been presented using the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, 
which allows for comparing Gazprom Neft’s indicators with the practices of other companies  in Russia and abroad
2.
The Company regularly carries out industrial environmental control and monitoring  of environmental components, conducts audits of the HSE, OS and CD management systems  at its subsidiaries and affiliates and evaluates key areas of the activities of its enterprises  
in this regard. In 2015, the Company launched a project to improve occupational safety culture.  
The Gazprom Neft Management Board determined a corporate strategy  
for the development of Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE), Occupational Safety (OS) and Civil Defence (CD) in subsequent years, its priorities and the key objective  
in industrial safety and environmental protection: “Goal – Zero: No Harm to People, 
Objects or the Environment”. This vision is based on the belief that each accident  
or injury can be prevented. 
“ People’s lives and health are our 
number one value and it is our belief that no good results can  
be justified if they are achieved  
in violation of safety rules  
or run counter to the principles of environmental protection. Building an effective workplace safety system is a top priority  
for Gazprom Neft. The agents  
of change at any company  
are the leaders first and foremost. Gazprom Neft senior executives have undertaken personal commitments to strictly observe workplace safety rules.  
I am confident that this example will provide a systemic impetus  
to our employees and contractors to reconfigure business processes and change the production culture and attitude towards issues of occupational safety  
and health ”.

www.gazprom-neft.comSAFETY CULTURE
The safety culture at Gazprom Neft is based on the personal 
responsibility of each employee and the involvement  
of all Company employees and contracting organisations 
in the process of improving safety levels. This priority  is reflected in the Company’s corporate slogan – “Safety Starts 
with You”. The Company continuously develops its employee 
training system in matters of industrial, environmental  and occupational safety. The training of personnel is systematic, 
standardised and closely linked to other components  
of the management system. In 2015, Gazprom Neft updated  its standard for training and testing knowledge in matters  
of HSE, OS and CD. The new version devotes greater attention 
to corporate training, specifies a competency profile  for managers and specialists, and distributes functions  
and responsibility for training.  
In 2015, a total of 6,620 individuals underwent training  
in industrial safety, 3,852 people in occupational safety  
and 968 people in environmental safety and nature conservation.
Contracting organisations are also involved in the Company’s 
training system. The managers and specialists of contractors 
undergo cascade training on environmental safety  
in the following areas:
 ↗the requirements of corporate documentation  
in environmental protection;
 ↗compliance with the requirements of environmental legislation at production facilities;
 ↗the handling of production and consumption waste  at the Company’s facilities.In 2015, more than 600 employees from contracting organisations underwent cascade training to improve  
their skills.
In order to improve the environmental culture and motivate 
employees, key requirements have been visualised in the form 
of posters and reminders posted throughout all Gazprom Neft production enterprises. Reminders have also been specifically 
developed for representatives of contracting organisations 
and posted at the facilities of the Upstream and Downstream Divisions.
Exchanging experience in HSE, OS and CD matters  
within the Company and with external organisations plays  
an important role in the safety culture training and development system. In 2015, Gazprom Neft held an annual thematic conference on matters concerning industrial safety. Forums  
and training sessions on industrial and environmental safety 
were organised. In 2016, the Company plans to update  the Basic Safety Rules – 
safety corporate standards  
that are mandatory for all employees –  and launch  
a communications campaign to accompany their  
introduction.

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015Supply chain responsibility 
In accordance with the updated standard, cooperation with contractors entails:
 ↗forming qualification/pre-qualification requirements in matters of environmental protection 
when selecting a contractor;
 ↗concluding separate agreements with the contractor on industrial, environmental  
and occupational safety;
 ↗managing the effectiveness of the contractor’s activities: establishing key performance indicators, monitoring activities and delineating responsibilities and powers; 
 ↗analysing the effectiveness of the contractor’s work in matters of HSE, OS and CD  based on which contracts are extended, and maintaining databases (with the ability  
to search for and record the history of interaction with contracting organisations);
 ↗improving the skill, motivation and awareness levels of personnel from contracting 
organisations on matters concerning environmental protection.
The Company held a special forum for key contractors to introduce its partners to the updated work standards. In 2015, Gazprom Neft organised the first forum “Improving Effective Interaction 
with Contracting Organisations in Industrial Safety”. The forum speakers included Gazprom Neft 
executives and leading foreign experts in the industry. The form addressed the main tools  and methodologies for developing safety culture. Gazprom Neft specialists presented the “Steps” 
programme that aims to introduce corporate safety rules at contracting organisations. In 2016, 
Gazprom Neft plans to introduce a system to rate contracting organisations in terms of HSE, OS and CD as well as a corporate database of contractors. The compliance of activities performed by contracting organisations with corporate 
standards in matters of HSE, OS and CD is one of the basic criteria the Company uses  
to select contracting organisations. In 2015, Gazprom Neft revised its strategy  
and updated the standard for cooperation with contracting organisations.
“ Each year Gazprom Neft  
facilities employ more  
than 100,000 employees  
from contracting organisations. 
Statistics show that  
the vast majority of accidents occur with contractors.  
This situation requires us  
to adjust our relationships  
with contracting organisations. The implementation  
of the “Steps” programme  
will enable us to evaluate  
the development level  
and attitudes of contactors towards safety issues during  
the tender stage. We will select the ones that are willing to meet our requirements and are familiar with our safety philosophy ”.
OLEG NIKOLAYENKO
Director of the Industrial Safety 
Department of Gazprom Neft 
The Company has been conducting competitions among the contracting organisations of subsidiaries since 
2015 to determine the leaders in HSE, OS and CD.. The competitions determine the leaders in HSE, OS  and CD, among other things. Winners are selected based on a number of criteria. For example, the rating  
of the Eco-Leader competition held at the Messoyakha branch of Gazpromneft-Razvitie was compiled based on 20 criteria for compliance with environmental safety: the environmental condition of production facilities and area, the organisation of waste handling work and compliance with environmental impact requirements, among others.CONTEST AMONG CONTRACTING ORGANISATIONS

www.gazprom-neft.comStakeholder engagement
The Company’s environmental protection commitments are incorporated into the socioeconomic 
agreements that Gazprom Neft concludes with a number of regions where it operates.  
In 2015, such agreements were in effect with the governments of the Vologda, Kemerovo,  
Omsk, Orenburg and Tyumen Regions as well as the Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Districts.
When developing new projects, the Company holds public hearings at which it informs 
stakeholders about its planned activities and provides access to the documents that are being 
drafted. The Company adjusts the design documentation based on comments and suggestions 
made at public hearings. In 2015, public hearings were held and public approval was secured for 43 projects implemented by Gazprom Neft, including projects to develop fields and expand 
their well pads as well as build landfills to neutralise and dispose of production waste. Hearings 
were held in the Khanty-Mansiysk, Nizhnevartovsky and Surgutsky Districts of the KMAD-Yugra and the Nadymsky, Purovsky and Tazovsky Districts of the YNAD. The hearings were attended 
by representatives of indigenous peoples of northern Russia, local residents and municipal 
administration officials. 
Gazprom Neft hosts environmental conferences each year to exchange experience in matters 
concerning environmental protection. One conference was held for the sixth time in 2015  and attended by more than one hundred Company employees and division directors  
from the central offices of the Russian Federal Supervisory Natural Resources Management 
Service and Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing.  
The conference participants discussed problematic aspects of legislation and amendments  
that are to be introduced, new approaches to measuring the human impact on the environment and the prospects for eliminating accumulated environmental damage. The event was the first Gazprom Neft interacts with a broad range of stakeholders in matters concerning 
industrial safety and environmental protection. The Company is involved in work  
to improve the norms of environmental legislation as part of its interaction  
with the government and involvement in the activities of the Russian Union  of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RUIE) and other working groups. Gazprom Neft CEO  
Alexander Dyukov and Industrial Safety Department Director Oleg Nikolayenko  are members of the RUIE Industrial Safety Committee.

are installed at facilities that  
are not part of the refinery  
and we measured them.  
There are also sufficient systems 
around the refinery that monitor

Deputy Director  
of Mosecomonitoringstep in the development of corporate environmental protection programmes and the resolution  
of urgent problems and also helped to form additional skills in environmental protection 
technologies and management procedures given the changing environmental legislation.
The Company’s information transparency is an essential component of engagement  
with stakeholders. Gazprom Neft is carrying out different communications projects to allow 
the public to receive information on matters concerning environment protection. For example, Gazprom Neft and the Russia Today international information agency launched a joint project  
to cover activities on the Prirazlomnaya oil platform on the latter’s website in 2015  
(http://arctic.ria.ru/prirazlomnaya/). The project highlights the importance of the economic 
development of the Arctic and the solutions used to ensure the environmental safety  
of oil production.
The Moscow Oil Refinery utilises an integrated system of strict environmental monitoring  
that features automated control over the impact of production on the atmosphere  
as well as channels for automatic data transmission to government oversight authorities.  The information is also available at the refinery’s website. In addition, an environmental indicator 
device for citizens was also put into operation with information displayed on a LED screen  
round-the-clock about the air quality in the area impacted by the refinery. The content  of different substances in the atmosphere is presented in the form of a scale with notes  
about the current levels and maximum permissible concentration. 
Gazprom Neft actively cooperates with public organisations and environmentalists.  
During the reporting year, experts from the Green Patrol public environmental organisation paid a visit  
to the Moscow Oil Refinery, where they were able to see the results of the first stage of the refinery’s 
modernisation programme first-hand. As part of the “What is Moscow Breathing? ” study, experts measured 
the amount of harmful substances in the air at the site and found no excess hydrogen sulphide levels.  
The refinery was the first major enterprise in the Moscow region to invite independent environmentalists  to its production facilities to take air samples. “WHAT IS MOSCOW BREATHING? ”

New methods were developed to assess technological 
and professional risks and are now part of Gazprom Neft’s 
Integrated Risk Management System. The methods were 
developed taking into account the best international practices and provide for risk assessment during all stages of activities 
starting from investment in a project. In 2016, the Company 
plans to train employees in these methods and introduce them to the production process. The revision of the HSE, OS and CD 
risk management process required changes in approaches  
to production control. Safety inspections and audits now take 
into account the correlation of violations detected and the risk 
level. A new type of control was also introduced – a leadership 
behaviour-based safety audit. This is a standardised process  for a manager to observe an employee’s actions at work in order 
to identify behavioural strategies and subsequently discuss 
them with the employee. The audit reveals the current level  of safety culture, highlights the most motivated employees  
and helps personnel to identify and eliminate risks in their work. The Company is developing and implementing programmes 
to enhance industrial safety levels and improve the work 
conditions and health of employees. 
Such programmes aim to: 
 ↗prevent and eliminate emergency situations;
 ↗monitor compliance with industrial safety requirements;
 ↗conduct an industrial safety expert evaluation of equipment and bring production facilities into compliance  
with the requirements of industrial safety standards  
and rules;
 ↗modernise emergency protection systems;
 ↗organise the occupational health and safety of employees;
 ↗ensure safe work conditions and set up work stations  that meet the relevant government and corporate standards;
 ↗provide employees with personal protective gear;
 ↗provide comprehensive training for the Company’s employees in matters of HSE, OS and CD;
 ↗study and introduce advanced technologies in such matters.

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015In the event of accidents, the Company conducts an investigation  
and then draws up and introduces an action plan to minimise 
the risk of a repeat accident. Preventive measures are carried 
out at all subsidiaries in accordance with the plans developed by the Company.
Spending on HSE, OS and CD measures totalled  
more than RUB 10,974 million in 2015 (excluding joint  
and foreign assets). The Company invested more  
than RUB 45,231 million in such measures in 2013-2015.This work resulted in a reduction in the number of incidents 
at the Company’s production facilities in 2015 and a further decrease in the injury rate (LTIFR). Much to our deep regret, 
two of the Company’s employees were killed during an attack 
on a filling station in Kazakhstan in 2015. The Company sincerely mourns their loss and is doing everything possible to prevent 
such a tragedy from repeating.3,4133,566

www.gazprom-neft.comThe Company implements transportation safety programmes 
that include production control, safe driving training, internships 
and safety briefings, and monthly “Stop-watches” – meetings 
on matters concerning HSE, OS and CD. In 2015, Gazprom Neft 
carried out work to equip fuel tankers with technical hands-free equipment that make it possible to promptly contact drivers 
in the event of restrictions on route stops when transporting 
hazardous freight. The Company has also developed stickers  
that read “Caution! Blind Spot! Driver Does Not See You”,  
which it places on the right side of the cabs of fuel tankers.  
The stickers inform those involved in the transportation process about the risk of collision and the risk of being in this area.
The number of road accidents decreased 13.2% in 2015 
compared with the previous year despite an increase  
of 8 million kilometres in the distance travelled. 
Gazprom Neft is working to standardise its fire safety control 
system, introduce corporate requirements for the fire protection 
of facilities and implement fire safety programmes. The number of fires and ignitions fell 28% in the reporting year compared 
with 2014.TRANSPORT AND FIRE SAFETY
Fire-fighting training exercises were conducted at the East 
Messoyakha field using new equipment – the Du-51 wall nozzle. The use of this device is particularly appropriate for fires in modular 
buildings with “sandwich” walling, which is the predominant type  
of structure among buildings at the branch. The wall nozzle  
consists of a hollow tube connected to a sleeve through which  
the extinguishing agent runs. The wall nozzle forces its way through the walling and water is fed through the hole along with a foaming 
agent. Carrying out work without opening windows and doors restricts the flow of oxygen to the fire, accelerates the extinguishing process and minimises the risk of injury. The fire was extinguished  
in 15–20 seconds during the testing.FIRE SUPPRESSION TRAINING

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH
The Company’s main occupational health measures include 
organising safe work conditions, regular medical check-ups  
and clinical examinations of employees, training in first aid methods and building a culture where employees look after their health. In 2015, the Company introduced methods to ensure the safety  
of food, water supply and sanitary conditions at remote production facilities and also organised medical check-ups for its employees. Updates were made to the Anti-Alcohol and Anti-Drug Policy,  
which sets uniform principles for employees of the Company  
and contracting organisations in this regard. The Company carried out a campaign called “Sobriety is the Norm” to support  
the introduction of the principles of the updated policy. Gazpromneft-Yamal implemented a pilot project to launch  
the electronic medical examination system (EMES). The system 
allows for assessing an employee’s health without the involvement 
of a medical officer. Based on the implementation results,  
the Company began introducing the EMES project at the remote 
facilities of the subsidiaries of the Upstream Division. For the purposes of civil defence, the Company improves  
the resilience of its production facilities in the event of emergencies  
 and trains staff to be able to handle such situations, including 
in difficult climatic conditions. During the reporting year,  
the Company conducted more than 600 exercises and training

PROTECTING THE ATMOSPHERE
Reducing pollutant emissions is one of the primary 
environmental objectives in Gazprom Neft’s operations.  
The Company implements a range of measures that aim  
to comply with the established standards and reduce specific emissions of pollutants from stationary and mobile sources. 
Gazprom Neft oil refineries are implementing a large-scale 
modernisation and reconstruction programme that includes projects to mitigate the negative environmental impact.  
In 2015, the Moscow Oil Refinery began preparations  
for the reconstruction of the catalytic cracking unit,  
which will increase the unit’s annual production capacity  
and reduce sulphur content in petrol and hydrotreated vacuum 
gasoil. The refinery has been producing fifth emission standard 
motor fuel (Euro-5) since 2013. Over 900
managers and employees 
underwent environmental training in 2015 
85
www.gazprom-neft.comThe Omsk Oil Refinery also fully transitioned to producing  
high-octane Euro-5 petrol in 2015 as a result  
of the modernisation of its catalytic cracking unit.  
The refinery also launched a closed-cycle water unit  for the catalytic cracking units and a hydrogen  
compression unit that has capacity of 6,900 m
3 per hour.  
The water unit significantly reduces hydrocarbon emissions  
to the atmosphere. Emissions are expected to decrease  
28% following the completion of the modernisation programmes at the refinery in 2020.
“ The environmental conditions 
surrounding the refinery have improved. Gazprom Neft  
is employing the latest technologies. Today,  
the programme that  
is being implemented  
at the Moscow Oil Refinery  
is the most progressive one  
that we have seen from  
an environmental standpoint”.

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
The growing significance of problems related to climate change 
requires focused attention on greenhouse gas emissions,  
both at the company level as well as the level of industry  
and the country as a whole. The importance of these issues  
was once again emphasised in the agreement on measures  
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that was signed in 2015  
at the UN Climate Change Conference. As one of Russia’s largest oil companies, Gazprom Neft is actively developing an action 
programme to reduce emissions, in particular greenhouse gas 
emissions at its enterprises. One solution to this problem  
is to increase the APG utilisation level. The Company is also committed to more effectively managing risks related to carbon regulation and conducts an assessment of direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas emissions related to its activities. Given  
the structure of the Company’s activities and the requirements 
imposed on the industry, Gazprom Neft assesses greenhouse gas 
emissions by enterprises based on the following aspects:
 ↗direct greenhouse gas emissions related to the flaring  
of hydrocarbon fuel and substances, the operation  
of production facilities and process losses;
 ↗indirect energy emissions related to the consumption  
of third-party electricity, heat, steam or cooling.

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015UTILISATION OF ASSOCIATED PETROLEUM GAS
Associated petroleum gas (APG) is released during the extraction  
of oil at almost all fields. In order to improve the useful utilisation  
of APG, Gazprom Neft carries out projects to efficiently process 
APG directly in the regions where it operates. Implementing such programmes is one of the Company strategic objectives. 
The construction of infrastructure and modern APG utilisation 
facilities will make it possible to fully develop the assets under production and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In 2015, key projects to improve APG utilisation levels included:
 ↗THE CONSTRUCTION OF RUSSIA’S LARGEST COMPLEX GAS 
TREATMENT PLANT (CGTP) AT THE NOVY PORT FIELD  
IN THE YNAD. The plant is designed to compress, purify  
and dehydrate APG and utilise it by injecting it back  
into the productive formation. The commissioning  
of the CGTP will make it possible to utilise up to 95%  
of APG at the Novy Port field. The first phase of the CGTP 
is to be launched in early 2017. It will be able to treat  
up to 4 billion m3 of APG per year. The CGTP has design 
capacity of more than 7 billion m3 per year. ↗THE TESTING OF NEW APG UTILISATION TECHNOLOGY  
IN THE TOMSK REGION. Using the soft steam reforming  
unit, natural gas liquids contained in APG are processed into gas that may be used for power generation needs  
or pumped into a pipeline for transportation to consumers. 
The Company plans to consider the prospect of employing 
this technology at projects located in remote regions  
or where the construction of major units is not 
economically profitable.
 ↗THE COMMISSIONING OF THE SOUTH PRIOBSKY GAS 
PROCESSING PLANT. The joint venture between Gazprom 
Neft and SIBUR allows for utilising APG and producing 
natural gas liquids, which are valuable raw materials  
for the petrochemical industry. The South Priobsky GPP 
has processing capacity of 900 million m3 of APG per year. 
The target component recovery factor exceeds 95%,  
which is consistent with modern global requirements.  
The Company’s total investment in APG utilisation projects 
amounted to RUB 27.7 billion in 2015, a more than five-fold 
increase from the 2014 level. The growth in investments  is above all due to the significant increase in capital investment 
in the construction of gas infrastructure at the Novy Port  
and Messoyakha fields. 
The reduction in APG utilisation levels in 2015 is attributable  
to growth in the APG production/flaring volume as a result  of additional drilling in areas with a high oil/gas ratio.

www.gazprom-neft.comWATER MANAGEMENT
Gazprom Neft implements action programmes that aim to minimise  
its volume of water consumption, mitigate environmental risks 
in water resource conservation and improve the environmental 
condition of water bodies and their coastal areas. The Company regularly monitors water protection zones as well as surface 
water, groundwater and wastewater and assesses  
the bottom sediment conditions of surface water bodies  
in the areas where it operates. During the reporting year, 
scientists from the Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries 
and Oceanography carried out comprehensive studies  
of the water environment near the Prirazlomnaya offshore 
platform. The experts concluded that the key hydrological  
and hydro-chemical indicators of the water condition (transparency, salinity and the content of oxygen, hydrogen, 
inorganic phosphorus and other elements) are consistent  
with the natural background.
Key water resource conservation projects in 2015 included:
 ↗THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE WORLD’S TWO MOST NORTHERLY 
UNDERWATER OIL PIPELINE CROSSINGS VIA THE INDIKYYAKHA AND MUDUYYAKHA RIVERS (PART OF THE MESSOYAKHA PROJECT IN THE YNAD) 
 using horizontal directional drilling. 
Utilising this method made it possible to preserve the natural 
landscape of the rivers and eliminate any man-made effects  
in the flora and fauna. The inverted siphon (the section  
of the pipeline laid under the riverbed) was thickened by 5 mm to improve the reliability of the pipeline’s operation. In order  
to protect the environment against thermal effects,  
the inverted siphon was placed in a protective case  
with diameter of 1,020 mm and wall thickness of 16 mm.  
The route of the pipeline was selected based on consultations 
with representatives of the government authorities, public 
organisations and the chiefs of reindeer herding communities. ↗THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BIOSPHERA MODERN COMPLEX 
OF BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT PLANTS AND A UNIT TO TREAT SULPHUR AND ALKALINE WASTEWATER AND PROCESS CONDENSATE AT THE MOSCOW OIL REFINERY.  
 
The Biosphera complex will use a final water purification 
technology that is unique to the Russian oil refining industry 
and allows for increasing the efficiency of wastewater 
treatment to 99%. The use of a multi-stage biological treatment system will enable the plant to reduce water 
consumption by 60%, while 75% of the water will be recycled 
into the enterprise’s production cycle. The Biosphera complex is to open in 2017. In addition, a unit will be launched in 2017 
to remove sulphides and ammonia nitrogen from wastewater. 
The unit, which aims to ensure the highest possible environmental performance parameters for the operation  
of process facilities that are being introduced as part  
of the refinery’s comprehensive modernisation,  
will have production capacity of 120 m per hour. In 2015,  
the complex obtained a permit to discharge wastewater via a centralised water disposal system. At present, wastewater is only discharged at the Kuryanovskaya activated sludge 
plant. Overall, the complex reduced water consumption per 
measurement unit of the enterprise’s performance index by 6% in the reporting year thanks to the modernisation 
programmes
1. 
The Company’s employees took part in a number of nature 
conservation campaigns in the reporting year, including  
the nationwide campaign “Our Rivers and Lakes – Clean 
Shores”. The Moscow Oil Refinery served as a partner  
in organising and holding the “Protect the Shore!” 
environmental campaign in Kapotnya.
1 The Equivalent Distillation Capacity Index (EDCI) serves to assess the competitiveness indicators of enterprises. The EDCI for oil refineries is calculated according  
to a formula that includes the performance of refinery technological units and energy systems, pipeline and tank capacity as well as the capacity utilisation percentage

tonnage waste in order to mitigate its environmental impact. In order to meet this objective, Gazprom Neft began developing a corporate strategy for the utilisation of drilling waste  
in 2015. The goal of the strategy is to reduce the proportion  
of waste sent for disposal and to maximise its use in production processes as well as to employ the most environmentally  
and economically effective methods of waste utilisation taking 
into account the specifics of the regions where the Company operates. This work is to be completed in 2016. 
In 2015, Gazprom Neft completed research and development 
work aimed at improving the efficient use of drilling waste. 
Company specialists have developed technology to obtain 
environmentally friendly soil from drill cuttings that  can be used for the subsequent reclamation of sludge pits. 
A state environmental expert review has given a positive 
assessment to this technology. The Moscow Oil Refinery is the first Russian oil refinery  
to complete the disposal of all its accumulated oily waste.  The refinery fulfilled this requirement three years earlier  
than required. Over five years, the refinery utilised more  
than 180,000 tonnes of oily waste and eliminated the facilities  at which it had been stored. As a result, the enterprise freed up  15 hectares of land and reclaimed contaminated soil. WASTE DISPOSAL

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015PROTECTION OF LAND RESOURCES AND VEGETATION 
The Company implements comprehensive programmes to reclaim disturbed and contaminated 
land and sludge pits taking into account the climatic, hydrological, soil and vegetative conditions 
of the regions. The programmes feature an inventory of the land, an assessment of the soil 
contamination level and the selection of the most effective rehabilitation technology. As part  of the reclamation process, work is performed to remove dead wood, collect oily liquids  
and conduct the technical and biological stages of reclamation. Gazprom Neft annually  
conducts an assessment of the quality of environmental restoration work, including chemical  and analytical monitoring.
The Company is committed to reducing pipeline failure rates and the area of contaminated land. 
In order to meet these objectives, Gazprom Neft has employed a project since 2014 called “Clean 
Territory” that includes measures involving diagnosis, reconstruction, targeted repairs, inhibiter 
protection and corrosion monitoring. Thanks to the project, the number of failures over this period was 12% less than the projected level. A total of 442 km of pipelines were replaced in 2015.

in pipeline failures as part of the “Clean Territory” corporate project, which led to a decrease in the area of contaminated land. The increase in reclamation in 2014 versus 
2013 is attributable to land reclamation work for a remote group of fields with signs of salt contamination.Indicators 2015

In 2015, Gazprom Neft continued implementing the first “green” seismic survey methods employed  
in Russia. The Company completed seismic exploration work at the West Luginetsky licence area  in the Tomsk Region utilising new wireless equipment. The wireless system also generates substantial  
time efficiencies, particularly since sensors can be quickly placed and moved across uneven terrain.  
The clearing width required for the installation of sensors is almost a third smaller than that of conventional technologies. Utilising “green” seismic surveys has enabled the Company to cut in half the amount of forest felled in exploration work.“GREEN” SEISMIC SURVEY METHOD

The Company's field development projects include a programme to rehabilitate aquatic biological 
resources.
In order to comply with the President’s orders on the safe development of the Arctic, Gazprom 
Neft is implementing a perpetual corporate programme to preserve biodiversity based on a list  
of flora and fauna that serve as indicators of the stable conditions of the marine ecosystems  
of Russia’s Arctic zone. The programme was developed by the Company jointly with leading scientific research institutes, Russian Arctic National Park and the Marine Mammal Council taking 
into recommendations from the UN Development Programme, the Global Environment Facility,  
the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Russia.
Environmental monitoring was performed at the Prirazlomnoye field in 2015 based on orders  
from Gazprom Neft Shelf. Scientists studied the island coasts that are traditional breeding grounds for the endangered Atlantic walrus as well as the coast of the Pechora Sea and also 
collected samples of water, sediment, plankton and benthos (organisms living on and in the soil  
of marine and inland water bodies). The reproduction dynamics of plankton, which have  an extremely short life cycle, are one of the indicators of the ecosystem’s health. The study  
results did not reveal any significant fluctuations in the migration or distribution of walruses  
in the Pechora Sea since the start of oil production on the Arctic shelf. 
In 2015, Gazpromneft-Yamal committed to the artificial reproduction of muksun (a freshwater fish 
from the whitefish family) in the Gulf of Ob. The Company released more than a 1 million muksun minnows into the Ob River in 2015 and plans to release roughly 20 million minnows into water 
bodies in the YNAD and KMAD-Yugra before 2019.
The Company carried out the “Native Shores” campaign in the reporting year to stock the Gulf  
of Finland with whitefish and continue restoring the population of this fish species in the waters  
of the gulf. Some 5,000 whitefish minnows were released into the gulf as part of the campaign.“ Anyone who lives in the north  
is aware of how fragile  
and vulnerable the local nature is.  
This is why human efforts  
to reproduce biological resources 
and prevent species extinction  
are invaluable. In this regard,  
we are extremely grateful  
to Gazprom Neft for its social 
position: not only taking, but 
giving back as well. For Yamal,  
the muksun isn’t just a fish.  
It’s a brand first and foremost and also an indicator  
of the general well-being  
of the indigenous population.  
For this reason, we must make every effort to restore  
the numbers of this king  
of the water”.

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015Energy consumption and efficiency
Energy conservation and improving the energy efficiency 
of production assets are among the top strategic priorities 
of Gazprom Neft. 
The Company has employed a corporate Energy Policy since 2013. 
The Policy is a public document that declares the intentions  
and obligations of the Company’s management to all stakeholders to ensure improvements in the energy efficiency indicators  
of its production facilities as well as mitigate its negative 
environmental impact and also reduce the consumption  
of non-renewable energy resources.
In accordance with the Energy Policy, Gazprom Neft management 
carries out systematic work in this area to meet the following key objectives:
 ↗to allocate the necessary resources to introduce, maintain and continuously improve the Company’s energy management 
system;
 ↗to consistently improve energy efficiency indicators; ↗to establish benchmarks that correspond to the best global 
standards;
 ↗to observe legislative requirements concerning the use  
and consumption of energy and energy efficiency.
The Company’s activities in energy conservation and improved energy efficiency are based on the methodology of the international standard 
ISO 50001:2011 “Energy management systems. Requirements  
with guidance for use”, which is the best generally accepted 
international practice for the systematic management of activities  
in this area.
In accordance with the top-level division of business processes 
at Gazprom Neft, the Upstream and Downstream Divisions have 
independent structural units that are responsible for energy conservation and improved energy efficiency at the enterprises  
within the divisions. These units form a unified energy management system for their respective divisions in accordance  
with the requirements of international standard ISO 50001.
Goals Results
Establishment of a centre of excellence, personnel training and improved 
qualification levels among the chief power engineers of subsidiariesThe “Power” centre of excellence comprised of employees  
from the Company’s corporate headquarters and representatives  
of subsidiaries was established in 2015. It includes the Energy Efficiency network group whose goal is to identify and exchange best practices  
and experience in energy conservation and improved energy efficiency.
Implementation of energy conservation and improved energy efficiency programmes for 2015-2017Energy savings totalled 205 million kWh (RUB 640 million) in the Upstream Division and 3,973.9 TJ in the Downstream Division. Energy intensity  
in the Downstream Division declined 1.5% due to the introduction of new 
process units. 
Cost optimisation for the purchase of energy resources In addition to the savings from the implementation of the Energy 
Conservation Programme, the Downstream Division reduced energy 
resource expenditures by RUB 242 million.
Introduction, certification and development of the EMS for the Downstream 
Division in accordance with the requirements of international standard  
ISO 50001:2011Projects are being implemented at certain enterprises (JSC Gazpromneft-Moscow Oil Refinery) to introduce the EMS and prepare for its certification. 
Preparations are also under way to introduce and certify the unified energy 
management system at the Division, which will unite local energy management systems that were previously established at oil refining enterprises.  
The projects are expected to be completed in 2016.
Certification and development of a unified EMS in the Gazprom Neft Upstream Division for compliance with the requirements of international standard  
ISO 50001:2011The unified EMS for the Upstream Division was certified at the Division’s Corporate Headquarters and at the enterprises of Gazpromneft-

The main energy efficiency indicator at Upstream Division facilities is the specific electricity 
consumption for liquid extraction. In 2015, this figure decreased 1% compared with 2014.  
The Energy Efficiency Programme exceeded its target by 92% in 2015. The Upstream Division  
had energy savings of 205 million kWh (RUB 640 million). Highlights of 2015:  
 ↗use of high efficiency electric submersible pump units;
 ↗introduction of permanent magnet motors; 
 ↗operation of downhole equipment in periodic operating modes; 
 ↗reduction in water produced and its pumping into the formation (shutdown of unprofitable wells and performance of geological and technical measures);
 ↗selection of the optimal size and replacement of pumping units at water-injection and booster pumping stations and initial water separation units; 
 ↗installation of variable frequency drives on pumping equipment; 
 ↗reduction in power grid losses.
In 2015, the Division completed the cycle of introducing and certifying the EMS in accordance  with the standards ISO 50001:2011 and GOST R ISO 50001:2012. The Upstream Division’s corporate headquarters, Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegaz and Gazpromneft-Khantos all received 
certificates. A cross functional energy efficiency commission that includes managers of key 
functions and units within the Division was established for the administrative management  of the energy efficiency improvement process. Energy manager staff positions were introduced  
at all existing assets.
A rating-based survey of the energy management systems was conducted at Upstream Division enterprises throughout the year. The goal of the survey was to identify best practices in energy 
efficiency and replicate them at subsidiaries. The average rating was 65 on a 100-point scale 
based on the annual survey cycle. The Upstream Division’s enterprises carried out a number of measures in 2015 that resulted  
in a 26% decrease in oil shortages when power failures occurred compared with 2014.  
Taking into account the targets for oil production, the Company actively developed the capacity  of power generation facilities by building new and expanding existing autonomous power stations. 
The substantial reduction in the volume of heat consumed for oil production processes in 2015  
is attributable to the implementation of an energy conservation programme, the preservation  of production sites and changes in ambient air temperatures in 2014 and 2015.“ Meeting the challenges  
of improving the Company’s 
energy efficiency is inextricably linked to personnel motivation. The corporate annual bonus system utilises an indicator based on specific electricity consumption and the implementation  
of the energy efficiency 
programme. These indicators are 
transparent and apply  
to virtually all the production process functions of Corporate Headquarters and production enterprises. We also conduct energy management training. In 2015, distance learning was offered with approximately 90 specialists from corporate headquarters and subsidiaries receiving training course certificates”.

The specific energy consumption indicator is the most convenient for operational control. In the medium term,  the reconstruction of production facilities by enterprises,  
the transition to the production of Euro-5 petrol  
and the implementation of the Company’s environmental 
policy may lead to an increase in the value of this indicator.  
At the same time, the Energy Conservation Programme will help 
to mitigate – and in several cases negate – the impact of such factors.

Energy resource consumption costs decreased by RUB 938 million as a result of the measures 
to improve energy efficiency. The amount of heat, electricity and fuel saved totalled 3,973.9 TJ. 
The specific consumption of fuel and energy resources declined by 1.5% compared with the 2014 
indicators.
Gazprom Neft approved a comprehensive programme in 2015 to improve the reliability of power 
supplies to oil refining enterprises in 2016-2018. The programme was developed to systematise  
and standardise energy conservation work within the division, which previously had been carried out 
in a targeted manner, in order to resolve the most critical problems of specific enterprises. The goal 
of the programme is to reduce the instances and duration of unscheduled downtime in oil refinery process units resulting from disruptions in power supplies and power equipment failure.  
The Company plans to achieve this goal by:
 ↗identifying the factors affecting the reliability of power supplies;
 ↗introducing diagnostic tools, replacing worn items and installing backup items;
 ↗eliminating the bottlenecks of power supply systems to enterprises;
 ↗improving the design and maintenance quality of power supply systems;
 ↗applying design, schematic and engineering solutions featuring high reliability indicators.
Gazprom Neft is exploring and investigating opportunities for using alternative energy sources. Serbian company NIS, in which Gazprom Neft owns  
a 56.5% share, is actively developing the use of renewable energy sources. NIS operates geothermal units that generate energy for utility and industrial 
use. In 2015, the Company continued construction on co-generation units that produce electricity and thermal energy through the utilisation of APG  
and commissioned two power plants with total capacity of 3 MW. The Company already operates 13 such power plants, which along with other facilities cover approximately one third of the Company’s energy needs. 
NIS plans to build a gas turbine power plant (GTPP) with capacity of 140 MW at an oil refinery in the city of Pancevo in cooperation  
with GazpromEnergoHolding. The thermal energy generated by the GTPP will be supplied to the refinery in Pancevo and also sold on the Serbian energy 
market. The combined-cycle technology on which the GTPP operates ensures a high level of efficiency and, as a consequence, a low level of natural gas consumption. The new power plant will ensure reliable supplies of thermal energy to oil refineries while reducing fuel expenses and enhancing  
its environmental safety.RENEWABLE ENERGY: EXPERIENCE OF NIS“ We devote special attention  
to improving the energy efficiency 
of our assets. The measures we have conducted not only allow for cost optimisation, but also enhance the work of enterprises as a whole. The coverage  
of the Energy Conservation Programme and its impact 
expand with each passing year. 
Implementing the programme not only enables us to reduce costs, but also significantly improve  
the reliability of our assets”.

In September 2015, the Omsk Region Government  
and Gazprom Neft signed a protocol of intent that reflects  
the parties’ plans to start manufacturing Russian-made 
catalysts for oil refining in the Omsk Region. The Omsk Region 
Government has set up a working group to implement  
the project. The region’s legislative assembly has approved tax incentives for catalyst manufacturers starting from 2016.  
In December 2015, the project was granted the status  
of a National Project (by the Ministry of Energy). This status  
will allow for the establishment of new high-tech production  
and jobs in the region.CATALYST PRODUCTION“ The Orenburg area is one  
of Russia’s largest industrial  
and agricultural regions.  
Given the current conditions,  
we are actively working  
on an import substitution 
programme. This concerns  
both the manufacturing  
of the products that are being 
substituted in the region  
as well as an increase  
in the products of domestic 
manufacturers, including lubricants. The agreement we have signed is the next step in the implementation of this programme”.
YURY BERG

In 2014, Gazprom Neft, together with regional authorities, 
launched a programme to phase out imported lubricants  
and technical fluids used in various industries and utilities.  
The Company supplies lubricants and technical fluids to state  
and municipal enterprises that are similar to their foreign analogues but have a more competitive price. This enables  
the region to save money on vehicle maintenance. Gazprom Neft 
signed agreements as part of the programmes in 2015  
with the governments of the Orenburg Region, the YNAD, KMAD,

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015Goal Result
Expansion of the Company’s successful practices in the regions  
where it operates: “Native Town” festival, “City Space” street art project 
and an oil- and gas-themed tournament for schoolchildrenThe “Native Town” festival was held for the first time in Muravlenko  
and attended by 5,000 people (every sixth resident). 
The “City Space” project of street art and graffiti was carried out jointly 
with the “Stenograffia” festival in Orenburg, Noyabrsk, Muravlenko, Khanty-Mansiysk and the Arctic villages of Novy Port and Mys Kamenny. 
Based on the results of an assessment of the effectiveness  
of the Olympiad held for schoolchildren in 2014, the Company decided 
to launch a new project – the school-based oil- and gas-themed tournament “Multiplying Talent”. The tournament was attended by more than 1,200 people from St Petersburg, Tyumen, Noyabrsk, Muravlenko, Novy Port and Mys Kamenny.
The Company continued work to involve local communities in the joint implementation of projects that aim to improve the quality of life  
in the regions of operationsThe Company launched a municipal project laboratory in which  
local residents and leading Russian experts jointly developed  
and implemented a number of micro-projects that aim to develop  
the urban environment.
Sociological research on corporate volunteering at the Company  
and the development of the concept of corporate volunteering  
at Gazprom NeftThe survey polled more than 1,000 Gazprom Neft employees,  
who pointed out the need to develop a corporate volunteering  
system at the Company. The concept of corporate volunteering  
at Gazprom Neft was approved in September 2015  
(for more, see the “Corporate Volunteering” section) 
A grant competition for social initiatives was held in five regions where  
the Company operates (Omsk, Tomsk and Orenburg Regions, YNAD  
and KMAD-Yugra) with a fund of more than RUB 20 millionGrant competitions were held in the Omsk, Tomsk and Orenburg Regions, YNAD and KMAD-Yugra. The grant fund totalled  
RUB 21.89 million. A total of 379 projects were submitted  
and 79 of them were selected. Based on this work, the Company approved the corporate standard “Organisation and holding of grant competitions for social initiatives”.
Implementation of a pilot grant competition project for local authorities  
in the Orenburg RegionSeventeen applications were submitted for the first grant competition held by the local authorities of the Orenburg Region. The grant fund totalled approximately RUB 4 million. Six projects were implemented  
as part of the contest in 2015.
Development of an Internet portal for the “Native Towns” programme  
and the establishment of an effective communications channel with  
the local authoritiesPages for the programme were launched on Vkontakte and Instagram social media. These resources not only provided information  
about the projects being implemented and best practices, but also materials on social project planning such as publications and video lectures.Social activities
GOALS AND RESULTS OF SOCIAL ACTIVITIES FOR 2015 
All of Gazprom Neft’s social activities since 2013 have been 
carried out within the framework of the “Native Towns” social 
investment programme. All of the Company’s core production 
units have been involved in this work. When scaling interregional projects in specific regions, their content is determined 
in accordance with the needs of the local target audiences. 
Subsidiaries annually prepare lists of projects taking  into account the urgent objectives for regional development  
and the opinions of stakeholders – the local and regional 
authorities, local communities and non-profit organisations.  
This approach helps the Company achieve a high level  
of efficiency from its social investments and flexibly take into 
account the specific features of the regions and the urgent 
objectives for the development of the regions.
107
www.gazprom-neft.comAs it implements the “Native Towns” programme, the Company 
strives for local residents to become more involved in carrying 
out social projects. This helps to boost their commitment  
and competence in resolving regional development problems and achieve a long-term systemic effect from social 
investments. In this case, a key objective for the Company  
is providing financial and educational mechanisms to support  the initiatives of local residents.The programme’s geography expands with each passing year. The number of regions where the programme is implemented 
expanded by eleven in 2015. The programme encompasses  
34 regions and includes more than 450 implemented projects. 
Investment in social activities amounted to more  
than RUB 3,966 million in 2015.
The Company conducted a study titled “Creative environment  
and social development trends of Siberian cities” (regions studied – 
Noyabrsk, Muravlenko, Tyumen, Tomsk and Omsk) jointly  
with the Leontief Centre for Social and Economic Research  
and the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences of Saint Petersburg  
State University in 2015. The study determined the potential impact  
of creative industries and social projects on the socioeconomic  
 on the regions and the social wellbeing of local residents.  
Gazprom Neft and the Strelka institute jointly conducted a study  
of urban communities in Omsk and their potential to develop  
the urban environment as well as key opportunities and barriers  
that may arise when interacting with such communities. This study was particularly relevant given that, according to the All-Russia Public 
Opinion Research Centre, the social optimism index among Omsk citizens 
in June 2014 was below the national average (64 points versus 77).
  The study results were taken into account when planning  
the Company’s social investment programme for 2016  
and the format for involving citizens and informal urban communities 
in the development of regions. The “DIY City” project laboratory  
was launched in 2015 in Omsk, where citizens worked with experts  
to develop and implement five social projects over the course  
of the year. STUDY OF URBAN COMMUNITIESSTRUCTURE OF THE “NATIVE TOWNS” SOCIAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMME //

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015When developing and implementing social projects, the Company relies on research data that reveals 
urgent problems in the social sector (including in the medium term), in particular:
 ↗monitoring of the socioeconomic and political situation in the regions of operation;
 ↗analysis of statistical indicators concerning the socioeconomic development of Russia’s regions;
 ↗research by the federal executive authorities of the Russian Federation.
Each year Gazprom Neft utilises a broad range of tools to assess the effectiveness of its social projects, including: 
 ↗public hearings/meetings of residents when planning social investment programmes;
 ↗online voting/open competitions among the public  
as part of the implementation of social investment projects 
(including as part of the “Native Town” Festival, “Urban 
Space”/“Stenograffia” and “DIY City”);
 ↗collecting feedback on the website of the social investment programmes rodnyegoroda.ru;
 ↗sociological studies of the opinions and ideas of the core target audiences in the regions where the Company’s 
production, sales and processing enterprises operate (YNAD, 
KMAD and the Omsk, Orenburg and Tomsk Regions).
In 2015, Gazprom Neft also conducted a study  
on the sustainability of the projects that won the grant competitions in 2013 and 2014. The mechanism used to distribute 
grant funds is an effective social investment tool that helps  
to encourage local communities to take the initiative to solve 
social problems while simultaneously developing their professional 
skills in this regard. Of the more than 700 competitive bids 
submitted for participation in the Company’s grant competitions over the last three years, 162 projects were selected and have 
been implemented. The study of the sustainability of the projects included multiple 
phases: 
 ↗determining the criteria for the sustainability of projects (eight criteria concerning organisational, financial  
and communications aspects of the projects);
 ↗interviews with the heads of the winning projects  
(a total of 71 interviews conducted);
 ↗an analysis of the interviews and additional materials about projects in accordance with the sustainability criteria  
and assignment of a current status to each project 
(sustainable, mixed, stagnate and completed).  Projects that continued to be implemented in full 
or expanded after the end of grant support with minimal risk 
factors.
Based on the study results, the Company classified  
62% of projects as sustainable, 20% as mixed, 2.8% as stagnant  
and 15.5% as completed. Practice has shown that the core 
factors in project sustainability are demand for the services being 
offered and engagement with the target audience. Numerous project authors have succeeded in attracting additional external 
funding to support the activities they have begun or to expand 
the target audience of a project.One of the winners of the 2014 grant competition in the KMAD was a project that targets people  
with musculoskeletal system diseases who are members of Sitting Skiers Club. A series of skiing  
and biathlon lessons were held for them. In 2015, the participants were joined by children with disabilities. 
Ski sleds and motorised wheelchairs were purchased for the Sitting Skiers Club. 
Winners of the grant competition in the Omsk and Orenburg Regions in 2014 also included projects 
to teach elderly and disabled people online computer skills. This service proved to be in high demand, 
and the “Keeping up with the Internet” and “Online for grandmas” projects supported by Gazprom Neft 
Orenburg were transformed into a large-scale initiative titled “Internet+” in 2015. Computer labs were set up in seven villages of the Orenburgsky and Novosergievsky districts and attended by 100 elderly people ranging in age from 55 to 80 years-old. “ Such lessons undoubtedly help 
children with musculoskeletal system diseases develop  
more actively. The Sitting Skiers Club provides yet another opportunity to become stronger and believe in yourself”. SVETLANA SLEPTSOVA

representatives of the regional and municipal authorities, the media, business partners,  
non-profit organisations, local residents, informal urban communities, university students  
as well as educational, cultural and sports institutions.
The main formats of engagement in the Company’s regional policy include: 
 ↗business meetings with representatives of the regional and municipal authorities;
 ↗public hearings;
 ↗the implementation of social projects;
 ↗conferences on matters concerning the regional policy, social investments and charitable 
activities;
 ↗seminars for potential grant recipients;
 ↗consultations with representatives of non-profit organisations when determining areas  
for social investments;
 ↗regular reporting by the Company on its social projects based on requests from the authorities as part of existing socioeconomic agreements;
 ↗surveys of local residents;
 ↗project laboratories to develop and implement social initiatives;
 ↗the joint implementation of volunteer projects;
 ↗social initiative festivals;
 ↗online voting and open competitions among the public as part of the implementation of social projects; 
 ↗collecting feedback on the website of the social investment programmes rodnyegoroda.ru.
In its efforts to develop a dialogue, the Company actively utilises the format of roundtables  and public hearings. Such meetings promote a constructive dialogue between enterprises  and local communities, help to identify social needs and designate significant themes  
when the Company prepares its sustainability report. In addition, public hearings serve 
as a platform for the actual beneficiaries to exchange experience.Engagement with stakeholders
Developing a dialogue with all stakeholders is a priority in the Gazprom Neft regional 
policy that not only allows for taking into account the interests of target audiences  
when planning and implementing the Company’s activities, but also ensuring the most 
effective possible investments in developing the regions of operation. 
Detailed  information about  
the goals and results  
of the roundtables is presented 
in Appendix  3 to this Report   
on page  130“ Companies and the public need 
to learn how to listen to and understand one another and unite their efforts based on mutually advantageous cooperation. It’s clear  that in addition to opportunities even core enterprises have restrictions and this is why  
it is essential to find a balance  
of interests and identify  
priorities jointly”.

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015During the reporting period, the Company held public hearings on matters concerning corporate 
social responsibility and sustainable development in Tomsk and Noyabrsk. The hearings were 
attended by representatives of the local and district authorities, major enterprises in the region, 
non-profit organisations and universities. Gazprom Neft representatives spoke at the meeting about the Company’s current production activities and plans in the regions, the development  
of HR potential among its personnel and the “Native Towns” social investment programme. 
In 2015, Gazprom Neft held a series of roundtables attended by experts and representatives  
of stakeholders on the following themes:
 ↗“New approaches to the development of public spaces”;
 ↗“How should business, the government, experts and citizens organise joint work and achieve 
results?”;
 ↗“Sociocultural design”;
 ↗“Interaction with partners and event management”;
 ↗“NPO social advertising: private donations in times of a lack of trust”;
 ↗“Interaction with the media”;
 ↗ “Business and NPOs”;
 ↗“The potential of creative industries”;
 ↗“Problems in relations between the authorities and informal urban communities”;
 ↗“The Company’s activities and the sustainable development of the regions of operation”;
 ↗“Implementation of projects as part of grant competitions for social investments”.
During the reporting year, Gazprom Neft and the Orenburg Region Government worked on matters concerning territorial planning related  
to the problematic situation with land use. A substantial portion of the Company’s production facilities were located on farmland, which imposed 
restrictions on production activities. Together with the regional government, the Company developed a roadmap on problematic areas in the region. 
As part of the roadmap, a project was implemented to classify the land of 23 municipalities as land for industrial use. 
The Company collected and reviewed proposals on changes to the site plans, prepared recommendations and held public hearings on this issue.  
The conclusions reached at the public hearings were published by the media on the websites of local administrations. Based on the results  
of the projects’ review by councils of deputies or municipal councils, all the problematic areas were classified as land for industrial use.

www.gazprom-neft.comThe Company also implements social initiatives jointly with its business partners and customers. 
One example of such cooperation is the annual “Day of the Fisherman” event held by the Company 
jointly with the Kaliningrad fishing port for employees of the port, sailors and local residents. 
Gazprom Neft also regularly organises charity and volunteer campaigns involving employees  from airfields and airports at which the Company provides refuelling. Such campaigns include 
volunteer clean-up work, visits to orphanages, Victory Day events and donor initiatives.  
In 2015, Gazprom Neft along with employees from its filling station network and customers joined  
the nationwide “Give a Veteran a Lift” campaign that was held from 1-10 May in all the constituent 
entities of the Russian Federation. Volunteers handed out stickers reading “I’ll Give a Veteran 
a Lift” to drivers at the Company’s filling stations. By placing the stickers on their vehicles,  car owners demonstrated their willingness to give a veteran a ride if requested.
A social campaign involving the manager and players of Football Club Zenit was held at a Gazpromneft filling 
station in St Petersburg on 4 March 2015. The players and manager spent several hours pumping petrol  
at the station. Revenue from the sale of fuel and goods during the campaign was donated to an orphanage 
to equip a modern computer lab. The event took place as part of the football club’s ’90 Good Deeds” charity 
marathon devoted to the 90th anniversary of Football Club Zenit in 2016.SOCIAL CAMPAIGNS WITH PARTNERSGazprom Neft is involved  
in developing and improving regional legislation

social investment programme  in 2015
CITIES FOR PEOPLE
OBJECTIVE:  creation of a high-quality urban environment that is competitive  
with the opportunities offered by major towns and cities, and expanded prospects  
for the personal fulfilment of residents. 
ACTIVITIES:  construction and major repair of housing, beautification of urban areas, 
infrastructure development of outdoor play areas for children and the development  
of joint initiatives with stakeholders.
As part of efforts to create mechanisms to involve local residents in the transformation  
and development of their urban environments, the Company jointly with the Strelka Institute  
for Media, Architecture and Design launched the “DIY City” project laboratory  in Omsk in 2015. 
Using this platform, Omsk residents together with representatives of the local government, 
business, non-profit organisations and urban studies experts were given the opportunity to draft 
and implement their own projects to develop the urban environment. Training in social project planning was held for the project’s target audiences – city activists and representatives  
of non-profit organisations, the creative environment and cultural institutions. The first lab participants launched five unique projects in 2015: a street art festival, a social project planning workshop for students, the “New Legends of Omsk” festival and a local initiative to merge 
residents of one of the city’s streets into a single community. The opening of the laboratory 
contributed to the establishment of a community of active citizens and demonstrated  
the effectiveness of such a social project planning format for the development of relations 
between all stakeholders. A seminar was arranged for laboratory participants to prepare 
applications for the grant competition in order to improve the quality of projects vying for grants.
Omsk hosted the “#noborders Festival” organised by the “DIY City” laboratory participants on 11 October. 
The festival was attended by roughly 1,000 residents of Omsk, who learned how to make video art  
and paint and underwent acting training. Artists painted the wall of the Youth Theatre with help  
from spectators. A giant bench was placed near the Youth Theatre during the festival as part  
of a project to alter the urban environment.#NOBORDERS FESTIVAL“ Changing the urban environment 
is not a fad or a kneejerk reaction to someone’s ambitions. We initially conducted a study and learned who needs a bench here and why. There are people taking leisurely walks here, meeting friends, rushing  to the theatre, work or school, 
plus elderly people need a place  
to stop and catch their breath. A ton of people pass through here and there is absolutely nowhere to sit. You can only change something by taking action, using your own hands and example”.

www.gazprom-neft.comBased on the results of an assessment of the effectiveness of the “Urban Space” street art 
project launched in 2014, the Company decided to alter its format in 2015 after becoming  
a partner of the “Stenograffia” street art festival that has been held in Yekaterinburg 
since 2010. The “Stenograffia” festival was held in Yekaterinburg, Khanty-Mansiysk, Noyabrsk, 
Muravlenko, Mys Kamenny and Novy Port in the reporting year. The objective of the project  is for the artists taking part in the festival to transform the city’s walls and building facades  
into artistic attractions. As part of the festival and its theme of the “Year of Literature in Russia”, 
artists also held a series of lectures and workshops for children and young people. 
Funding for the construction of homes in remote settlements and for IPNR is a separate  
area of the Company’s support for housing construction. In 2015, a residential building  
with 27 apartments was built in Novy Port with the bulk of the housing to be provided to members 
of the indigenous population who are relocating from the tundra. 
FIELDS OF VICTORY
OBJECTIVE: fostering a healthy generation and the establishment of strong regional  
sports schools.
ACTIVITIES: development of infrastructure for children’s and grassroots sports along  
with support for sporting events.
As part of efforts to promote grassroots sports, the Company implements  
the “Courtyard Sport”  project. 
In 2015, children’s and adult tournaments in mini-football, hockey and volleyball were organised  as part of the project in Noyabrsk, Muravlenko and villages of the Orenburg Region.  
Most of the competitions were held at sports facilities that were previously built as part  
of the “Native Towns” programme.
The Company traditionally supports landmark sports projects that have become the calling cards 
of their cities. A number of chess tournaments, including international competitions, were held  in Khanty-Mansiysk at the Yugorskaya Chess Academy, which was built with Gazprom Neft support 
in 2010. Seven new chess clubs were set up in the city and the district over the course of 2015 
to promote the sport. In Noyabrsk, Gazprom Neft supports the development of motor sports. The Company funded the purchase of motorcycles for a motor club as well as off-site and on-site 
competitions in the reporting year. “ Having the status of an official 
tournament of the Kontinental Hockey League allowed us  to integrate the Gazprom Neft Cup into the training system  for young hockey players.  Our tournament is a benchmark for kids who might go on  to become professional hockey 
players. We try to create  
all the conditions needed  for the Gazprom Neft Cup to become a milestone  on the initial path to a junior team, then a youth team  and ultimately the first professional contract  with a KHL team”.
ALEXANDER DYBAL
Head of the Tournament Organising 
Committee and a member of the 
Gazprom Neft Management BoardThe Company continued 
investing in the development  
of social infrastructure  in the reporting year.  In the Orenburg Region, landscaping was carried out  on the territory of a community centre in the village  of Nesterovka and playgrounds were built in the villages  of Novosergievka and Ivanovka. Three playgrounds  were also built in Omsk,  while seven bicycle racks  were installed in Muravlenko.

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015Gazprom Neft invests in the construction of sports infrastructure facilities. During the reporting 
year, several major sports facilities built with the Company’s support opened in the Yamalo-Nenets 
Autonomous District: multi-functional stadiums in the cities of Noyabrsk and Tarko-Sale,  
the Muravlenko sports complex and an ice palace in Noyabrsk. A branch of the Avangard Hockey 
Academy, a Gazprom Neft project that aims to establish a unified system of hockey training  
for children and young people, started operating within the ice palace. The construction and equipping of the ice palace and multi-functional stadium resulted in the establishment in Noyabrsk of a complex of modern sports facilities equipped with everything required for popular sports. 
Other sports infrastructure development projects supported by the Company in 2015 included:
 ↗the opening of a multi-functional sports facility in the village of Khanymey in the Purovsky 
District;
 ↗the equipping of volleyball and basketball courts in the Orenburg Region villages  
of Blagoslovenka, Chkalovka and Ivanovka;
 ↗the reconstruction of gyms at School No. 46 (Omsk) and a community centre in the village  
of Krasnoyarka (Omsk Region);
 ↗assistance in the repair of the Olimp sports complex in Tara.
NEW HORIZONS  
OBJECTIVE: establishment of equal education opportunities for children from large  
and small cities.
ACTIVITIES: to improve the accessibility of high-quality educational infrastructure  
and training activities.
In 2015, Gazprom Neft launched a new educational project – the oil and gas-themed 
“Multiplying Talent” tournament among schoolchildren , which resulted from the reformatting 
of the Olympiad competition held for schoolchildren on the same theme in 2014. The main goal  of the tournament, which was developed taking into account current global practices,  was to enhance the appeal of engineering and technical professions among school students 
and develop their research skills. As part of the tournament, students solve tasks related to oil 
and gas themes and develop presentational skills. In 2015, tournament participants included 1,221 people from six regions in which the Company operates (St Petersburg, Tyumen, Noyabrsk, 
Muravlenko, Novy Port and Mys Kamenny). Eighteen teams from grades 8-11 took part in the final 
in St Petersburg. The finalists defended their decisions to a jury and took part in an oil and gas adventure game that aimed to test their knowledge without any prior preparation. “ A lot of effort went into making 
the school project a reality. Thank you to Gazprom Neft, which helped us at each stage  of preparation. It’s great there  is a company that actively supports youth sports in our native town and region.  This makes it possible to set up 
full-fledged children’s clubs  
at the school. Even the very youngest children can take part. We are preparing a special training programme for them”.

Gazprom Neft has been implementing projects that aim to promote maritime professions 
among young people jointly with the Maritime Board under the Government of St Petersburg 
since 2011. Such projects include the establishment of specialised maritime classes and children’s 
associations with a maritime and shipbuilding focus, the “Sea Calls” film festival and the “Morfest” intercollegiate festival, among others.  
In partnership with the Rostov regional military patriotic organisation “Youth Maritime Club”, 
Gazprom Neft began offering maritime classes in 2015 at which students prepare for service  
in the Russian Navy. The Company supports similar maritime classes in St Petersburg as well. 
“ The ability to logically reason 
and find a correlation  is an important requirement  
for a person living in modern society. We understand  the importance of mathematics for Russia’s successful future. Today, young people have  the opportunity to leave their

of this science”.
NIKOLAY KROPACHEV 
Rector of Saint Petersburg State 
University
“Mathematical Progression” – a joint project implemented by Saint Petersburg State University  
and Gazprom Neft that involves talented students with outstanding skills in mathematics and computer 
science – was launched in 2015. More than 50 students from 23 Russian regions who have undergone 
competitive selection visited St Petersburg, where they attended a series of popular scientific lectures  
by famous scholars and received detailed information about the educational programmes offered by Saint Petersburg State University. Gazprom Neft will pay scholarships at the end of the first year  
of studies to participants who enrol in Saint Petersburg State University.
Gazprom Neft has been cooperating with Saint Petersburg State University for several years  
and has supported the Chebyshyov Research Laboratory since 2013. The Company provides support

GAZPROM NEFT  //   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015CULTURAL CODE  
OBJECTIVE:  development of the cultural potential of the regions.
ACTIVITIES: support for cultural events and initiatives that are significant for the residents  
of the regions where the Company operates.
The “Native Town” festival, which was first held in Noyabrsk in 2014, expanded  
its geography in 2015 to include Muravlenko as well as Noyabrsk. The festival has transformed  
from a leisurely family event to a platform for the consolidation of the local community  
and the personal fulfilment of residents. Citizens have become more co-organisers  
than spectators of the festival, which features local creative groups, educational and sports 
associations, and interactive platforms. 
The Noyabrsk festival was attended by 7,000 people, while the Muravlenko festival  
was attended by 5,000.The Company implemented a number of projects that aim to develop creative industries  
and the urban environment jointly with the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences of Saint 
Petersburg State University and the Leontief Centre for Social and Economic Research  
in the reporting year:
 ↗the “Career Centre” project, which aims to develop skills among the local community  
in the creative industry and social project planning. The project participants attended 
lectures and roundtables with the participation of Russian and foreign experts in this area; 
 ↗the international scientific and practical conference “Creative Tools of Social 
Entrepreneurship and Social Project Planning”, which brings together leading experts  
in social project planning as well as representatives of business, the government  
and creative industries. As part of the conference, sessions were held at which organisers of social projects from Tyumen, Omsk, Noyabrsk, Tomsk, Moscow and St Petersburg 
presented their initiatives;
 ↗an open competitive for socially-oriented projects in St Petersburg. The theme  
of the competition was the transformation of the Krasnogvardeysky District Library  
into a modern public space. Seventeen people took part in the project and the winner 
received a grant to implement its project. 
In 2015, Gazprom Neft became the general partner for the “PORA!” social communications festival for the second time and also supported one of the main cultural events of Yugra –  
 the “Spirit of Fire” film debut festival. 
The theme of the festival, which was held for the thirteenth time, was the seventieth 
anniversary of victory in World War II. “ Our city implements numerous 
projects that aim to create conditions for the appropriate leisure of children and adults. The “Native Town-Muravlenko” festival, which was held  for the first time, provided people with numerous positive emotions. We intend to make it a tradition 
and hope that it will become one 
of the favourite festivities  
of Muravlenko citizens”.

OBJECTIVE:  support for the traditional ways of life of indigenous peoples of the Russian north  
and facilitating their integration into the modern economic and social landscape.
ACTIVITIES:  financial support for families of IPNR and holding traditional events.
In addition to support for the traditional way of life of IPNR, Gazprom Neft supports events  
that aim to preserve the national identity of IPNR, establish cultural ties between various communities and families, and attract public attention to the preservation of traditional crafts  
and trades. In 2015, such events were expanded to include Reindeer Herder’s Day in Muravlenko 
and the villages of Khanymey, Novy Port, Khalyasavey, Tolka and Russinskoy as well as Fisherman’s Day in Novy Port. Contests in traditional sports were held at all sites with prizes awarded  
to the winners. 
Gazprom Neft engages in production activities in areas where indigenous peoples of the Russian north 
(IPNR) reside in the Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Districts. The Company concludes agreements with the heads of IPNR families under which it provides financial assistances as compensation 
for the impact of production activities from the development of oil and gas fields. In 2015, the Company 
concluded more than 200 such agreements to reimburse IPNR for expenses related to the support  of their families: for the use of land plots and the purchase of foods, lubricants, special clothing, construction materials, boat motors and snowmobiles. In addition, Gazprom Neft helps farming  
communities of indigenous peoples that live in areas of hydrocarbon exploration and production,  
and also allocates funds to purchase equipment, fishing equipment, lubricants and construction materials.THE SUPPORT OF IPNRThe Company also supports

KURDISTAN
The Company supported events dedicated to Remembrance Day for victims of the chemical attack 
on the city of Halabja, provided assistance in organising a youth creativity festival in Darbandikhan 
and carried out a number of campaigns to landscape urban areas.
SERBIA
Gazprom Neft provided support for Serbia’s biggest classical music festival “Bolshoy” for the third 
time. The initiator was is filmmaker Emir Kusturica. Young talent from the Russian regions where  
the Company operates (Omsk, Tomsk, Muravlenko, Noyabrsk, Orenburg and Khanty-Mansiysk) took part in the competition programme for the first time. 
Jointly with NIS and the Djokovic Foundation, the Company funded the construction of ten physical 
and chemical laboratories at Serbian schools that were damaged as a result of flooding last year. “ The laboratory significantly 
alleviates the work of physics and chemistry teachers. Experiments are a practical part of learning, and children find physics to be very abstract, especially in elementary school. Thanks to the new tools that we received, they no longer have  
to imagine what physical laws 
look like since now they can see them for themselves. Children now show more interest  in physics classes”.

Corporate volunteering  
Gazprom Neft has been developing the “Personal Contribution” volunteer movement 
since 2008. Over this time, Gazprom Neft has gone from holding one-off charity events 
to implementing systemic projects with maximum volunteer involvement. The Company’s 
volunteer movement encompassed 38 Russian cities during the reporting year and included 2,633 people. 
In 2015, Gazprom Neft developed and adopted the Corporate Volunteering Concept  
with an implementation period until 2020. The priority areas of the concept are projects  
in ecology and assistance to children. This list also includes sport, culture, education, science  
as well as assistance to the elderly and homeless. In order to determine priorities for volunteer activities, Gazprom Neft conducted a study that encompassed approximately 1,000 people. Based  
on the study results, the first volunteer project contest for employees was launched. A total  of 40 projects that aim to solve various social problems in the regions were submitted  for the contest, and 23 winning projects were implemented in Moscow, Muravlenko, Noyabrsk, 
Omsk, Orenburg, St Petersburg, Tomsk, Tyumen and Chelyabinsk. The Company plans to develop 
a special training programme for volunteers in 2016 to implement volunteer projects more effectively. 
119
www.gazprom-neft.comIn 2015, the Company carried out a number of volunteer campaigns dedicated to the seventieth  
anniversary of victory in World War II, including the “We Remember, We are Proud!” charity event. As part  
of the campaign, a tour was arranged of the Marinesko Submarine Forces History Museum for children 
from the Kalozhitskoye and Vyborg orphanages and the Yefimovskaya boarding school. The tour focused  
on the feats of Russian and Soviet submarines. Following the tour, the volunteers held a talk with  
the children and told them about the war. Company employees read poems about events of the war,  
shared family stories and showed the children pictures, letters, orders and medals from their personal 
archives. VOLUNTEER CAMPAIGNS“ It was very touching to see how 
the volunteers discussed themes in preparation for the campaign. Since we live in St Petersburg,  we could not skip the theme  of the siege of Leningrad.  And this was all based  on the examples of our grandfathers and fathers.  
The anxiety that the volunteers 
felt when speaking about those difficult times was conveyed  
to the children. They listened  with bated breath”. 
ANNA CHESANOVA
Chief Specialist of the Regional 
Development Department  
of Gazprom NeftGazprom Neft volunteers took part in 265 events in 2015 with the key activities being donation, 
support for orphanages and boarding schools, the clean-up of different areas as well as landscaping 
and beautification. Volunteers traditionally provide assistance to children at orphanages:  
they help them prepare for the school year, give them gifts on holidays and organise educational  
and creative workshops as well as sporting and festive events. The Company believes the key objective in supporting institutionalised children is to expand their opportunities for socialisation  
and to realise their talents.
In 2015, Gazprom Neft volunteers took part in a number of initiatives dedicated to the celebration  
of the seventieth anniversary of Victory Day in World War II that were held in all the regions  
of operation. Such initiatives included preparing festivity programmes for war veterans and retired 
workers in the industry, visiting war veterans at their houses and veteran homes, laying wreaths  
at memorials, landscaping events and special tours for institutionalised children, among other things.
The Gazprom Neft “Nearest and Dearest” mutual assistance fund is intended to provide material  
and organisational assistance to employees and their families in difficult situations. The Fund’s 
activities are based on the principle of co-financing by employees and the Company. The Fund 
collected approximately RUB 13 million in 2015.
The second Gazprom Neft Volunteer Forum, which brought together the Company’s most active 
volunteers, was held in 2015. The Forum’s objective is to exchange experience, discuss current 
practices in volunteer activities and provide training and skills enhancement in social project planning. The most active volunteers from the regions where the Company operates are traditionally 
given awards as part of the Forum.RUB 13  mn
