The U.K.’s greenest civic centre
Incorporating a host of energy- and 
water-saving ixtures, sensors and 
gardens, the Brent Civic Centre in 
London is the irst public building in 
the U.K. to receive an Outstanding 
BREEAM rating for sustainability. 
The combined oice building and 
community space features a concrete 
façade and lightweight roof that 
harness natural light and warmth, but 
limit excess heat and glare, while open 
windows and ventilators provide fresh 
air and natural cooling nearly year-
round.  AECOM delivered an array of 
planning, design and sustainability 
services for the project. −Expected to use 65 percent less 
energy and 45 percent less water 
than a conventional building

About this report  
The steps we took in 2015 to 
continually improve and expand our 
commitment to sustainability 
reporting. 
“The greatest positive 
impact we can have 
globally is in the 
transformational 
outcomes we deliver.”7 6Golden 1 Center, home of the NBA’s 
Sacramento Kings, is on target to 
achieve a minimum of LEED Gold. 
The arena is designed to revitalize 
downtown Sacramento and ofers a 
unique indoor-outdoor environment 
with hangar doors that open to 
welcome fans and allow breezes 
that naturally cool the building.  
AECOM provided a combination of 
urban planning, architecture, sports 
architecture, landscape architecture 
and building engineering services.
One hundred percent of the arena’s 
electricity will come from solar energy, 
allowing it to serve over 200 events 
a year at net-zero energy. Through 
LED lighting, lighting controls, heat 
recovery and a “Fan First” ventilation 
system, the building saves enough energy to power a 120,000-square-
foot oice building. Through native 
and drought-resistant plants, 
water-sensitive landscape design, 
high-eiciency cooling equipment 
and low-low plumbing ixtures, the 
building will save 700,000 gallons of 
water annually.
 −Sourcing 90 percent of food and 
beverages from within 150 miles 
will help reduce the building’s 
carbon footprint by 2,000 tons 
annually. 
 −Thirty-six percent of materials for 
the building come from recycled 
sources, including fans’ old athletic 
shoes, which are recycled in the 
court’s foam layer.A greener shade of gold

Electric vehicles, recycled materials 
and energy-eicient lighting all 
formed part of the approach to 
delivering a safer and more eicient 
drive around Perth Airport in Australia. 
Main Roads Western Australia 
wanted its Gateway WA highway and 
interchange upgrade project to be 
designed, delivered and operated 
in a socially and environmentally 
responsible manner. AECOM 
developed the project’s sustainability 
program, which has helped Gateway 
WA win the distinction of becoming 
the irst road project in Australia to 
earn an Excellent rating for design 
from the Infrastructure Sustainability 
Council of Australia. −Project site staf drove electric 
vehicles for their inspections.
 −Constructors have used more 
than 907,000 metric tons (1 million 
tons) of recycled material and 
repurposed 1.6 million metric tons 
(1.8 million tons) from cut-waste 
recycled materials to date. 
 −Substitution of materials resulted 
in an approximate 10 percent 
reduction in total asphalt quantity 
for the project overall.Ambitions to improve energy eiciency 
and environmental performance at Los 
Angeles International Airport have 
produced impressive results. Replacing 
a 50-year old facility, the  airport’s new 
Central Utility Plant (CUP) is 25 percent 
more energy  eicient than its 
predecessor. For example, upgrading 
to variable-low pumping technology 
for the plant’s chilled-water systems 
saves almost 1.6 million kilowatt-hours 
annually. In addition, improvements 
include a new heat-relective roof, 
drought-tolerant landscaping and 
automatically controlled lighting and 
air-conditioning systems that have 
been designed to achieve a LEED Gold 
rating. We supported the program with 
construction management services. −CUP is expected to save the airport 
an estimated US$7 million annually 
in electrical and natural gas costs, 
with an additional  
US$2 million in savings from 
municipal utility rebates as a result 
of the plant’s ability to generate 
electricity through its operations.
 −The energy eicient operations are 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions 
by 4,890 tons per annum.On the road to sustainability Sky high improvementsLos Angeles International Airport

2014 Project of the 
Year, Design-Build 
Institute of AmericaSupporting Denver’s work to achieve 
its 2020 Sustainability Goals, AECOM 
helped transform an underused 
neighborhood into a new transit hub. 
The Union Transit Station project in 
Denver, Colorado converted almost 
20 acres of an abandoned rail yard 
into a mixed-use development that 
combines bus, light rail and passenger 
rail facilities with 1.35 million square 
feet of oice, retail and residential 
property development and public 
space.  AECOM coordinated all 
aspects of transportation planning 
and acted as lead designer for the 
design-build team that delivered the 
US$489 million transit component of 
this public-private partnership. −This project supports Denver’s 
eforts to achieve its 2020 
Sustainability Goals, which include 
reducing the number of single-
occupant vehicle commuting trips.
 −The Union Station Bus Concourse 
has a LEED Gold rating for its use of 
recycled materials in construction 
and the incorporation of skylights 
in its design to provide natural light, 
among many other sustainability 
features in its design and 
operation.
 −2014 Project of the Year, Design-
Build Institute of America.From steam engine to 
economic engineWe are implementing a USAID 
program, the Southern Africa 
Trading Hub, which aims to increase 
intra-regional trade, food security 
and international competitiveness 
for farmers. One of the program’s 
initiatives was recognized with a 
2015 Oracle Sustainability Innovation 
Award. For decades, smallholder 
farmers have lacked adequate storage 
facilities for their harvested produce 
and sufered up to 30 percent losses. 
The warehouse receipts system 
(WRS) provided a solution with Oracle 
technology. −WRS ofers smallholder farmers 
the opportunity to store produce 
rather than sell it at harvest time 
when prices are at their lowest. 
 −Storage facilities use a web-
based application that integrates 
commodity receipting systems 
with the payment of the supplier. 
 −A recordkeeping application 
analyzes data and enables 
inanciers to pay the supplier 
accurately and on time for goods 
delivered.
 − The twin target of reducing its carbon 
footprint while also saving money was 
the challenge set by global acrylics 
manufacturer Lucite International. 
Its goal was to achieve 20-percent 
savings in energy costs and reduce 
carbon below 2010 levels by 2020.  
AECOM performed audits on ive of 
Lucite’s global sites, including those 
in the United Kingdom, United States, 
China and Taiwan. Beating Lucite’s 
targets, our team of engineering and 
sustainability professionals identiied 
energy eiciency measures that 
could reduce 30 percent of total 
carbon emissions and 20 percent of 
total energy consumption at these 
facilities.  −The measures identiied potential 
savings across the ive sites  
of over US$20 million and more 
than 140,000 metric tons of  
carbon dioxide.
 −Many of the measures focused 
on improvements at the Sulphuric 
Acid Recovery unit (SAR) which 
consumes more than 60 percent of 
the energy at each plant. 
 −Opportunities for on-site power 
generation were also identiied, 
with some sites having the 
potential to become self-suicient 
in power, signiicantly reducing 
costs and also improving business 
resilience to external factors such 
as unplanned outages.

Against a backdrop of increasing 
globalization, climate change and 
urbanization, 100 Resilient Cities — 
pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation — (100RC) was established 
to help cities build resilience to social, 
environmental and economic shocks 
and stresses. The program aims to 
help cities to become more resilient to 
the wide range of complex and 
interrelated physical, social and 
economic challenges facing them.  
AECOM is a strategy partner for 
100RC, working alongside chief 
resilience oicers in 16 cities helping 
to assess the city’s baseline resilience  
and developing strategies to improve  
the resilience to everything from  
homeless and afordable housing, to  
sea level rise and drought, to cyber and  
energy security. As key partner to 
100RC,  AECOM is also helping to 
develop and reine tools, share lessons 
learned and scale best practices for 
100RC.  AECOM was supporting the 
following cities (by the end of 2015): 
San Francisco, Dallas, Berkeley, 
Oakland (United States), San Juan 
(Puerto Rico), Montreal (Canada), 
Santiago de Los Caballeros 
(Dominican Republic),  Mexico City, 
Juarez,  (Mexico), Quito (Ecuador), 
Rotterdam (Netherlands), Melbourne,

Wellington and Christchurch (New 
Zealand).Building more resilient 
cities
The U.S. Navy’s Space and Naval 
Warfare Systems Command 
(SPAWAR) Systems Center Paciic, 
in  San Diego, California, is a state-of-
the-art research, development and 
testing facility for command, control, 
intelligence and communication 
systems and ocean surveillance 
operations.  AECOM delivered an 
innovative and comprehensive 
energy savings performance contract 
that dramatically improved energy 
conservation across the facility’s  
224 buildings with a combined 
workspace of 3,032,000 square feet. 
 −AECOM’s Sustainable Systems 
Integration Model for Energy™ tool 
generated and evaluated multiple 
energy conservation measures 
options in a live “game-boarding” 
environment.
 −The project achieved a net energy 
reduction of 37 percent, driving 
US$383,000 in annual utility cost 
savings. 
 −As a result, the facility reached 
its mandated energy goals two 
years ahead of schedule and 
strengthened its future resilience

A research station for the 
world’s toughest climate
The world’s irst-ever permanently 
manned, fully relocatable polar 
research station, Halley VI, is a 
record breaker in many ways. It was 
created for the British Antarctic 
Survey (BAS) with AECOM as 
multidisciplinary engineer and lead 
consultant and Hugh Broughton 
Architects as designer. The project 
won the 2015 American Society of 
Civil Engineering’s Outstanding Civil 
Engineering Achievement Award.
The station’s design was developed 
to minimize environmental impact. A 
vacuum drainage system has helped 
to reduce water usage from 120 liters (31.7 gallons) per person per day at 
Halley V to just 20 liters (5 gallons) per 
person per day. 
 −Sewage is irst treated in a bioreactor 
before being incinerated. This means 
when the station moves, nothing is 
left behind except clean water. 
 −Highly energy eicient, Halley VI 
uses 7 percent less fuel  
than the previous BAS station.  
Its cladding incorporates 
polyisocyanurate foam, a high-
performance insulator, and 
translucent glazing using nanogel 
technologies developed in the aerospace industry that ofer high 
levels of thermal insulation and 
light transmittance.
 −The modular design and large 
steel skis on each foot enable the 
station to be relocated, adapting to 
changes in the ice shelf upon which 
it sits.

In every aspect of our lives we are aware 
of the impact we make on our planet.  
As a global corporation we take our 
responsibilities seriously and have  
made great progress in reducing our 
environmental impacts. We look at all 
areas of our operations, from reducing  
our consumption of resources such as 
paper and water, to reducing our 
emissions from leet vehicles and oices. 
We know there is always room for

In Austin, Texas, AECOM’s campus 
consists of ive buildings that span 24 
acres with landscaped areas. Water 
conservation initiatives, introduced by 
the local sustainability committee, 
have reduced water usage by 32 
percent in 2015 (based on a 2011 
baseline). 
Solutions, such as installing an 
automated system to prevent 
irrigation system leaks and moisture 
sensors that adjust the watering 
schedule based on rainfall, have 
generated a water savings of more than 14.3 million gallons since 2011. 
To increase savings further, the 
committee is evaluating additional 
measures including rainwater 
harvesting and inclusion of low-water-
use plants, known as xeriscaping.
Although the majority of our oices 
do not have the ability to track water 
consumption, several oices in our 
Greater China/Southeast Asia region 
also track their water use, reporting a 
17 percent reduction on a per capita 
basis from FY2014 to FY2015.Smart water savingChelsea Burkett, local sustainability

We regularly measure and report 
on the volume of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions resulting from our 
operations. With the acquisition 
of URS Corporation and Hunt 
Construction in 2014, the magnitude 
and relative mix of AECOM’s GHG 
emissions have changed signiicantly. 
As such, we have chosen to use 
this year’s 2015 GHG inventory, 
which includes all major sources of 
emissions for the combined company, 
as our new baseline year for reporting 
purposes.
Starting with this year, we implemented 
a global methodology based on the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (developed 
by World Resources Institute and 
World Business Council on Sustainable 
Development), to manage the 
transparency, accuracy and 
consistency of the data collection and 
calculation processes. Our new global 
sustainability data management tool, 
powered by FigBytes, will allow us to 
more eiciently and efectively 
analyze data trends and identify 
opportunities for continuous 
improvement.Our carbon footprint Setting targets
By 2020 we aim to reduce our GHG 
emissions by 20 percent, normalized 
by revenue, below the 2015 baseline. 
We plan to achieve this target by irst 
focusing on our two largest sources 
of emissions — leet fuel use and 
oice electricity and natural gas 
consumption. Speciic initiatives 
include consolidating our real estate 
footprint globally, transitioning to 
a leaner and more fuel-eicient 
leet of vehicles in our Construction 
Services Business Group, improving 
sustainability training and access 
to tools/resources for our project 
managers, and developing 
sustainability guidelines for new 
leases and leasehold improvements. 
In our commitment to continuous 
improvement of our environmental 
performance, we will assess new 
emissions reduction opportunities as 
we collect and analyze improved data 
from our global operations.11,916

The Kuala Lumpur Centre for 
Sustainable Innovation (KLCSI) is a 
joint venture between AECOM and 
Malaysia’s Ministry for Federal 
Territories. It focuses on public and 
private sector engagement to develop 
innovative and sustainable solutions 
for improving the city’s livability.
Launched in 2015, the KLCSI provides 
a collaborative hub to encourage pilot 
projects for the built environment, as 
well as city management, urban 
mobility, information and 
communications technology, public 
safety, waste and water management 
and clean energy. It provides a space 
for international experts, local entrepreneurs and innovators to 
share knowledge and technology.
Initial projects include a bike sharing 
initiative aimed at reducing the city’s

waste-to-compost recycling network 
to support urban gardens and a 
community center to encourage 
intergenerational connectivity 
between the elderly and youth.Building a living laboratory We believe that working across sectors

“We hope to open 
the door for bigger 
impactful schemes 
that AECOM can 
deliver by leveraging 
on our own innovative 
practices worldwide.”  
Dr. Thomas Tang, 
director, KLCSIKuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 20 21According to its latest assessment, 
the United Nations Oice of 
International Strategy for Disaster 
Risk Reduction (UNISDR) believes the 
global impact of disasters now costs 
up to US$300 billion annually. But 
greater collaboration between cities 
and businesses is reducing shared 
risk and increasing shared value in the 
face of this challenge.
A new tool is helping bring together 
the private and public sectors in this 
area.  AECOM developed the Disaster 
Resilience Scorecard in partnership 
with IBM and the UNISDR. It has been 
used in dozens of cities around the world to engage local businesses, 
communities and government 
departments to build a quantitative 
picture of the strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities and threats upon which 
to prioritize disaster risk reduction 
measures, response planning and 
recovery. In Bandung, Indonesia, the 
scorecard has strengthened the links 
between the public and private 
stakeholders who can contribute to 
disaster risk reduction.
The scorecard won the 2015 ND-
GAIN Corporate Adaptation Prize  
from the University of Notre Dame, 
United States.
Since 2012, AECOM has partnered 
with CDP’s Global Cities program, 
providing data analysis and 
information design for its annual 
global reports. Cities are hubs of 
innovation, growth, urbanization and 
economic activities, but they also 
consume signiicant amounts of 
energy and contribute to carbon 
dioxide emissions. This presents 
cities with a major opportunity to combat climate change. More than 
500 cities use CDP’s platform to 
report on their climate change-related 
data every year. CDP and AECOM use 
this large data set to produce analysis 
and reports relating to how cities are 
tackling these challenges.

employees rallied to assist in the 
disaster relief and recovery eforts in 
one of Asia’s most disadvantaged 
countries.
AECOM’s Guillaume Prudent-Richard 
and Amit Prothi were on assignment in 
Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital, when the 
quake struck. They were there to help 
run a disaster-risk management 
workshop, but what was only a 
scenario model for the two planning 
experts suddenly became very real.
They worked with the client, 
Kathmandu Valley Development Authority, to ensure everyone on the 
project was accounted for and safe. 
Their colleagues in our corporate, 
regional and local oices donated 
more than US$95,000 to international 
aid organizations, such as the 
International Red Cross and RedR, in 
the months following the event.

AECOM’s culture of caring sets an 
expectation for each employee, 
contractor and business partner to 
take personal responsibility for 
protecting the safety of our colleagues 
and others associated with our work. 
Whether located on a project site, in 
the oice or at home, we embrace 
safety as a lifestyle choice by 
maintaining essential safety procedures 
and behaviors everywhere we go.
As highlighted in our recently released 
2015 safety report, we have exceeded our safety performance goal — 
coming in at 7.5 percent under our 
targeted corporate recordable 
incident rate. Similarly, our corporate 
lost workday case rate has reduced  
by 11 percent*. This number 
represents a signiicant decrease  
in both the number and severity of 
serious injuries globally.
*To account for AECOM’s integration 
with legacy URS, this percentage is 
the average improvement from 2010 
to 2015. 2010 to 2014 data relects legacy  AECOM operations; 2015 data 
relects the combined company’s 
operations.Safety

Closing Message from the 
Sustainability Program 
Advisory Board Award-winning conservation
The Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, California, United 
States, to which AECOM is a 
contributing partner with leadership 
responsibilities for Facilities, 
Infrastructure, and Environmental, 
Safety & Health, was recognized 
for its eforts in water conservation 
by the National Nuclear Security 
Administration (NNSA), which 
selected the lab for one of its 2015 sustainability awards for innovation 
and excellence. The award was for the 
lab’s multifaceted approach to water 
conservation in drought-stricken 
California. Through implementation 
of its water conservation plan, which 
targets water consumption in cooling 
towers, domestic use and irrigation, 
the lab cut its water use by more than 
10 percent of its 240 million gallon 
annual total. 
LLNL Sustainability Manager and  AECOM 
employee Michael Cowen (recently retired), 
standing next to a reverse osmosis unit that 
recycles water for a lab cooling tower, says 
the lab’s sensitivity to the state’s drought 
led to some changes, including cutbacks of 
more than 10 percent of its normal water use
