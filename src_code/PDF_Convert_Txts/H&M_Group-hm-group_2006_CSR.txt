Here we report on the most important events of 2006 
within the area of the corporate social responsibility. This year’s report is shorter than last year’s. Our policy 
documents and working methods are unchanged and 
are described in the 2005 CSR Report. 
Next year H&M’s CSR work will be reported in 
accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) updated guidelines for sustainability reporting. The GRI has also developed special reporting guidelines for companies in the apparel and footwear industries. H&M 
was involved in this process and will apply these 
guidelines in addition to its CSR Report for 2007.

H&M does not own or run any factories. Instead our 
products are produced by approximately 700 suppliers, primarily in Asia and Europe. Some of these suppliers are 
in developing countries where the textile industry 
represents a significant proportion of export revenues. The production of H&M’s goods contributes to the employment of many people in a number of countries. 
Taking responsibility for how these people and the 
environment are impacted by our activities is essential if H&M is to be able to grow while maintaining profitability.
Code of Conduct leads the way
We are aware of the risk of workers’ rights being infringed and environmental legislation not always being complied with in the manufacture of our goods. As a 
buyer, however, we can help work towards improving 
conditions. This work is based on our Code of Conduct, which is based on the ILO conventions and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and includes the following requirements:
n	compliance with local labour law
n	statutory pay and working hours
n	the right to organise and bargain collectively
n	a ban on child labour
n	a ban on discrimination
n	a ban on forced labour
n	health and safety in the workplace
n	compliance with local environmental legislation During the year H&M also developed its health and safety requirements, particularly in connection with sandblasting. 
Agreement reached with P&G
In earlier CSR reports, H&M has stated that a number of suppliers of cosmetics that are sold under brands other than H&M’s own have not signed our Code of Conduct. 
During 2006, H&M came to an agreement with one of 
these suppliers, Procter & Gamble (P&G). The agreement entails that P&G declares where the merchandise that is sold in H&M’s stores is produced and gives us the right to monitor the production. This means that we can 
assess P&G in the same way as is the case with our 
other suppliers. 
However, P&G still has not signed H&M’s Code of 
Conduct. Instead, they refer to their own. Procter & 
Gamble’s “Sustainability Guidelines for Supplier Rela-
tions” are available at www.pg.com.h&M’S

Code of Condu Ct
Environmental requirements of productionH&M’s Code of Conduct states that its suppliers must comply with all relevant environmental legislation. In 
practice, the requirements cover the handling of 
chemicals, waste management and waste-water treatment. 
H&M requires factories that carry out wet processes 
such as washing and dyeing to treat their waste-water. With effect from this year we are also setting require-ments of the quality of water discharged by applying guidelines developed by seven companies within 
Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), which include H&M. Should the legislation in a production country be stricter, then naturally the law takes precedence. 
In a first step the requirements relating to water 
quality will apply to suppliers with their own washing 
facilities. In the future, subcontractors’ washing facilities 
and suppliers that dye fabrics themselves will also be 
covered. 
Read more about the BSR guidelines at www.bsr.org/
waterquality. When our suppliers sign H&M’s Code of Conduct they also undertake to apply our chemical 
restrictions. You can read more about our chemicals 
restrictions in our 2005 CSR Report.enviRonMental Requi ReMent S

MonitoR ing the 
Supply Chain
All the factories involved in producing H&M’s products 
are covered by our Code of Conduct. It applies both to our suppliers and to any subcontractors that they may 
use. Our system for follow-up of production conditions, 
the Full Audit Programme (FAP), has the same scope. Suppliers of materials used by H&M’s suppliers – such as fabrics and buttons – are not covered by the 
monitoring programme, however. 
When H&M begins collaborating with a new supplier 
or when an existing supplier engages a new subcontrac-
tor an extensive FAP audit is carried out. The aim is to 
obtain as accurate a picture as possible of conditions at 
the factory. The audit usually includes over 300 ques-tions and each audit takes two to six working days to complete. 
During the audit the auditors carry out a visual inspec-
tion of the plant, go through employment contracts, time sheets, payroll reports and other documentation and talk to factory employees and management. After each audit the results are discussed with the supplier. The supplier is then given a certain period in which to draw up a plan for remedying any shortcomings. This action plan 
generally includes both short-term and long-term aims 
and provides a starting point for the improvement work. H&M’s auditors will follow up the implementation of the measures. Depending on circumstances, it may be 
around two years before the next FAP audit is due, 
which will then form the starting point for a new cycle of improvements.
In 2006 we focused on developing methods for 
follow-up visits. We held workshops in Vilnius, Bangkok and Phnom Penh at which H&M’s auditors met up to exchange experiences and discuss possible improve-ments.

and the assessment of existing and potential suppliers in our 2005 CSR Report.ouR Method in b Rief

In some countries homeworkers may be used for parts of production. This is usually needlework carried out by women, where for various reasons employment in a 
factory is not an alternative. 
Homeworking is not always regulated by labour laws 
and there may be no formal contract of employment. 
Moreover, homeworking often takes place in remote 
locations in villages far from the factories. These 
circumstances mean that we have to adapt our methods of workplace control. In 2006 we updated and standardised our tools for follow-up of homeworking in order to improve follow-up and contribute to better conditions for those making 
H&M products at home. Our follow-up of homeworking 
focuses on workers having written contracts and reasonable pay (at least the statutory minimum wage), the right to organise and bargain collectively, and 
ensuring that no child labour is used. The updated tools 
will be tested and assessed in 2007.

In 2006 we made a total of 1,474 visits to our suppliers 
with a view to assessing compliance with H&M’s Code of Conduct. 937 of these visits were made in Asia and 537 
in Europe and in other markets from which we buy. 19.5 
per cent of the visits in Asia and 33.8 per cent of the visits in Europe and in other markets were unannounced. 
1,032 of the 1,474 visits were FAP audits. In Asia a 
total of 639 FAP audits were carried out, 407 of these at existing factories. The equivalent figures for Europe and other markets were 393 and 174.
442 of the year’s 1,474 visits were follow-up visits to 
factories that had already undergone an FAP audit. 298 of the follow-up visits were made in Asia and 144 in Europe and other markets. 
In 2006, 341 out of 451 potential new factories met 
H&M’s minimum requirements at the first FAP audit and were thus approved for the production of H&M goods. New factories are given around six months to improve their compliance with the Code of Conduct. Of the total 
110 non-approved factories, 51 were given a second 
chance in conjunction with a follow-up visit. 42 of these were then approved for the production of H&M goods.

be found in our 2005 CSR Report. about thi S yea R’S audit S
In 2006 all the audits were carried out within the framework of our new FAP follow-up system, which involves fewer but more thorough audits. At present an 
audit may take up to six working days and a follow-up 
visit one working day. It was therefore expected that the number of visits to the factories of our suppliers and their subcontractors would be lower than in previous years. In 2006 a total of 1,474 visits were made, consisting of 
1,032 FAP audits and 442 follow-up visits.

What do the figures mean?
The table below shows the results of the 894 FAP audits that had been completed by the end of the year. An audit 
is deemed complete when the factory has submitted an 
action plan and the audit has been recorded by the CSR department at H&M’s head office. Thus 138 of the year’s total 1,032 FAP audits are not included in the statistics 
reported here. 533 of the audits reported were carried 
out in Asia and 361 in Europe and in other markets from which we buy. 
The statistics state the proportion of FAP audits in 
Asia and in Europe and other buying markets respec-tively in which deviations from local labour law and from H&M’s Code of Conduct were found. The various sections of the table correspond to the questions in our 
audit form and the areas of our Code of Conduct. 
It is not possible to draw conclusions concerning 
developments by comparing this year’s statistics with the 
figures from 2005. This is firstly because 2006 is the first year in which each audit was performed within the 
framework of the Full Audit Programme and secondly 
because FAP audits are generally carried out every other year, which means that the majority of the factories that underwent an FAP audit in 2006 were not visited for this 
purpose in 2005. In addition, our suppliers do not remain 
entirely constant from year to year, which means that it is not possible to make an entirely fair comparison over time. Despite the shortcomings of the statistics, they 
provide a general picture of conditions at the factories 
assessed in 2006 and serve as a starting point for directing future efforts. FAP statistics for the yearThe FAP statistics for the year show that the most common deviations from H&M’s Code of Conduct are to 
be found within the following areas:
Asia
n	Grievance system (58.9%)
n	Overtime working within the limits set by law (56.5%)
n	Worker – management communication system 
(46.3%)
n	Contract of employment in accordance with H&M’s 
requirements (43.9%)
n	Safety data sheets for chemical products (43.9%)
Europe and other buying markets
n	Worker – management communication system 
(67.9%)
n	Grievance system (62.9%)
n	Waste disposal (60.9%)
n	Contract of employment in accordance with H&M’s 
requirements (59.8%)
n	Safety data sheets for chemical products (57.6%)
A number of areas are considered to be underreported. 
This applies in particular to information concerning water 
treatment, due to the fact that the list includes both factories that are covered by the water treatment requirement and factories that are not. This means that 
the reported proportion of factories at which deviations 
were found is lower than is actually the case. In addition, it is assumed that there are deviations at more factories than our audits were able to demonstrate within the 
following areas:  
n	Overtime compensation
n	Freedom of association 
n	Sick leave, parental leave and annual leave 
n	Conditions for young workers

At H&M we work to bring about continual improvement. 
That also applies to our methods of monitoring how well our suppliers are complying with our Code of Conduct. 
Consequently, in 2006 H&M became a member of the 
Fair Labor Association (FLA). 
This means that FLA carries out independent audits 
of our suppliers’ factories in China and also reviews H&M’s systems for follow-up of the Code of Conduct. The results will be published during 2007 on the FLA website, www.fairlabor.org. 
The cooperation with FLA is an important quality 
assurance, but is also a way for H&M to show its stakeholders how effective its own follow-up is.independent Monito Ring

The overtime issue is among the most pressing chal-
lenges faced by the garment industry. H&M’s long-term aim is for the working hours at our suppliers’ factories to 
be within the limits set by law. In the short-term we are 
trying to gain greater insight into the causes of overtime working in order to be able to deal with the problem jointly with our suppliers. During the year a study of 
overtime was carried out at six of our suppliers’ factories.
The study showed that the suppliers could gain much 
by improving efficiency and control of production – by 
introducing better production planning, for example. It is a matter of taking preventive measures and making realistic assessments of what suppliers are capable of as producers. Similarly, H&M has to improve at assessing 
how reasonable its suppliers’ capacity calculations are 
and must not place larger or more complex orders than the factories are able to handle. We should also avoid making late changes to the garments. 
Clearly there is reason to investigate further the link 
between the actions of H&M and its suppliers and the amount of overtime worked, using a larger group of factories than those in the study carried out.towa RdS

Training for factory workersTo increase awareness of rights among factory workers and their supervisors H&M has continued its cooperation 
with the Bangladeshi organisation Karmojibi Nari (KN). 
During the year KN trained human resource officers at the four factories covered by the project. These human resource officers in turn trained around 5,000 workers. 
The training took between one and a half and two hours. 
In 2007, in cooperation with another international 
clothing company and the South Asia Enterprise 
Development Facility (SEDF), H&M will organise training 
in communications and rights for middle managers at a 
number of factories. It is hoped that matters such as pay, working hours and discrimination will thereby be addressed. The aim is to strengthen the factories’ own 
capacity by training human resource officers and other 
personnel who will then pass on what they have learned to other employees. In addition, local organisations will be trained to help the suppliers to organise this type of 
training themselves. 
 Development seminar for suppliers
Since we started our systematic follow-up work nearly ten years ago, conditions in our suppliers’ factories have 
improved considerably. Our FAP audits show, however, 
that much remains to be done. Considerable improve-ments in both working conditions and productivity are required if the producers are to be successful and 
competitive in the longer term.
To drive forward these developments at our suppliers, 
during 2006 H&M held a seminar in Bangladesh on 
workers’ rights and the link with productivity and 
competitiveness. This was attended by nearly 300 
representatives of H&M’s suppliers in the country. In addition to these and H&M’s own staff, a number of experts from trade and industry, academia and non-
governmental organisations also took part. Topics 
discussed included how the suppliers can go about creating a more open atmosphere and giving their employees opportunity to put forward viewpoints and 
bring grievances. The overall message was that the 
factories must give priority to their employees and improve the efficiency of the business in order to be competitive in the long-term.tRaining effo RtS

The challenges faced in the production countries are 
complex and their causes can be found at many levels. This means that H&M must join forces with other parties 
in order to counter the difficulties facing the garment 
industry.
Better Factories Cambodia
H&M has been supporting the Better Factories Cambo-
dia (BFC) programme since 2005. This initiative, which is run by the International Labour Organization (ILO), aims to improve working conditions for those employed in 
Cambodia’s garment factories. Its work includes training 
and independent monitoring. 
The controls carried out by BFC do not replace 
H&M’s own monitoring, but BFC’s assessments do 
provide verification of the results of our audits. Moreover, 
the information provided by BFC facilitates H&M’s initial selection when looking to cooperate with new producers in Cambodia. Read more about Better Factories Cambodia at www.betterfactories.org.
 MFA Forum BangladeshH&M also participates in the MFA Forum Bangladesh. The textile industry in Bangladesh faces a number of challenges that we believe should be dealt with at 
national and industry level rather than at company level. 
Consequently, a number of players have come together to improve working conditions and productivity in the Bangladeshi garment industry. In addition to around ten 
buyers, other participants include representatives of the 
Bangladeshi government, the local industry organisations BGMEA and BKMEA, the World Bank, the global trade union organisation ITGLWF and a number of other organisations. Read more about the MFA Forum at 
www.mfa-forum.net.Joint initiative S
H&M has been in partnership with UNICEF since 2004. 
So far we have contributed to a global programme promoting education for girls and a programme for the 
prevention of HIV/AIDS in Cambodia. In 2007 UNICEF will carry out a study commissioned by H&M. The study, 
which aims to chart the social consequences of cotton growing, will form a basis for future initiatives in this area.

H&M wants to actively contribute to reducing the 
environmental impact of cotton growing. Our strategy is made up of two parts: promoting organic cotton growing 
by contributing to increased demand, and improving 
conventional cotton growing.
Continued focus on organic cotton
Our intention is to gradually use more organically grown 
cotton, i.e. cotton grown without the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilisers. We also want to contribute to increased demand, thereby providing an 
incentive for more growers to concentrate on organic 
production. We are doing this by mixing in more organic cotton in certain garments. These garments are not specially labelled. 
In 2006 we used nearly 30 tonnes of organic cotton. 
The goal for 2007 is to mix at least 100 tonnes of organic cotton into parts of our range. In addition, H&M will launch collections in 100 per cent organic cotton, and as a result we expect to use around 600 tonnes of organic cotton in total.
H&M is also a member of the organisation Organic 
Exchange, the task of which is to promote organic cotton growing. Read more at www.organicexchange.org.
Improving conventional cotton production
Almost all cotton is still grown by conventional methods. In parallel with our efforts in respect of organic cotton, therefore, we are also working to improve conventional 
cotton growing through the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI). 
The aim of the BCI is to measurably reduce the negative social and environmental effects of conventional cotton growing. This cooperation was initiated by the Worldwide 
Fund for Nature (WWF), among others, in 2004. Read

Bleaching, dyeing and washing fabrics require large quantities of water, energy and chemicals. This makes fabric production one of the textile processes with the 
greatest impact on the environment. Since H&M does 
not generally deal directly with fabric suppliers, our opportunities to impose requirements on them are very limited. To contribute to cleaner fabric production we 
instead try to encourage the fabric dyehouses to take 
environmental considerations into account in their activities. We do this by pointing out the environmental gains and the cost savings brought about by more efficient use of 
resources. This approach is known as ‘cleaner production’. 
Together with BECO and the Wuppertal Institute, H&M has produced a tool covering around forty measures that the dyehouses can choose from. The process involves H&M’s auditors visiting the various facilities to assess the potential for improvement and to demonstrate possible action that can be taken. The dyehouses then draw up 
action plans stating which changes they have decided to 
implement. H&M follows up their progress every other month over a one-year period.
So far we have reached out to 23 dyehouses in India, 
China and Bangladesh. Since 2006 we have also been working with our vertically integrated suppliers, i.e. manufacturers of finished garments that also dye their own cloth. H&M takes a long-term view of the pro-
gramme and the idea is that it will form a permanent part 
of our environmental work in the supply chain. You can read more about H&M’s ‘cleaner production’ programme in our 2005 CSR Report.Cleane R fab RiC pRodu Ction
Since 2005 H&M has been licensed to use the Flower, the European Union’s official eco-label. The Flower represents restrictions on harmful substances and 
reduced water pollution throughout the production chain, 
from the raw cotton to the finished product. In addition, the label’s quality criteria indicate the garment’s ability to keep its fit and colour. The garments can be recognised by the flower label on the packaging and care instruc-tions. In 2006 about 190,000 Flower-labelled baby garments were sold in our stores – a marked increase on 
the 75,000 garments sold in the previous year. Since 
these garments are appreciated by our customers, in 2007 we plan to expand eco-labelling to more garments and to label more parts of the baby range. expan Sion of e Co-labelling

Energy use in buildings
Carbon dioxide emissions from the energy used in our stores, warehouses and offices were reduced by one per 
cent in absolute terms in 2006. Viewed in relation to the 
company’s growth (+11%), the reduction is twelve per cent. This development is explained in part by reduced heating requirements in H&M’s warehouse buildings as a 
result of the relatively mild weather, particularly in 
Germany and Belgium. 
Three sales countries – Germany, the UK and the USA 
– account for nearly half (47%) of H&M’s electricity con-
sumption and two thirds (67%) of the company’s electricity-
related carbon dioxide emissions. Germany alone accounts for 27 per cent of H&M’s electricity consumption and 42 per cent of electricity-related carbon dioxide emissions. Our aim 
for 2007 is to reduce emissions caused by electricity 
consumption in our German stores by buying electricity from renewable sources. Transport of goods and peopleCarbon dioxide emissions caused by the transport of goods were reduced by nearly one per cent in total, from 
154,280 to 153,108 tonnes. Emissions from transport by 
road, sea and rail have increased by nine per cent, which is in line with H&M’s increase in sales, while emissions from air and air/sea freight have been reduced by twelve 
per cent in absolute terms. During the year we worked 
actively to restrict air transport. Examples of this included the use of more combined transport (sea/air) rather than purely air transport compared with 2005, which 
consequently resulted in reduced emissions.
Carbon dioxide emissions from business travel increased 
by 31 per cent, while the Group’s company cars produced 
eight per cent more emissions of carbon dioxide compared 
with the previous year. Air travel accounts for most of the 
carbon dioxide emissions from business travel, but travel by train, bus, car rentals and own car also make contributions. We hope to be able to replace a certain amount of business travel by increased use of video- and teleconferencing. Read

Environmental work for reduced emissions
Reducing the company’s carbon dioxide emissions thus limiting its impact on climate is an important part of 
H&M’s environmental work. The goal is to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions by ten per cent between 2005 and 2009 relative to the size of the company measured in terms of sales, the base year being 2004.
A ten per cent reduction would leave H&M’s opera-
tions capable of giving rise to a maximum of 3.45 tonnes of carbon dioxide per million SEK of sales. The table 
below shows that our activities in 2006 caused 3.75 
tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per million SEK of sales. This is certainly an improvement compared with last year’s figure (4.15 tonnes CO2/SEK m), but our work 
on reducing emissions to a maximum of 3.45 tonnes/
SEK m continues. 
About the data collectedH&M’s carbon dioxide statistics cover emissions caused by goods transport, the transport of shopfitting and 
display material, business travel and the use of energy in 
our stores, warehouses and offices. The category of energy use includes electricity consumption as well as the purchase of heating or fuel for heating warehouses 
and certain stores. 
The statistics cover energy use where H&M has its 
own contract with suppliers of electricity, heating or fuel. Those stores that have their energy use included in the 
statistics account for 85 per cent of the company’s net 
sales.  
At present we are unable to collect statistics from our 
goods suppliers. The carbon dioxide emissions reported 
thus represent H&M’s own activities and transportation, 
and not the manufacture of our products. 
More information on data collection can be found in 
our 2005 CSR Report.

During the year 2006 H&M was named “Improver of the 
Year” in a recently introduced award from the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. The award is given to a 
company that has clearly improved its social and 
environmental actions. 
The reasons cited were: “Hennes & Mauritz has 
worked purposefully and systematically for a number of years to ensure that the company takes clear ethical and environmental responsibility for its activities in the long term. H&M’s strict requirements of suppliers have 
contributed to noticeable improvements in production 
conditions.”ReCognition
