In 2019, we leveraged our materials science 
expertise, global scale and operational excellence to once again make solid progress against our long-term strategic priorities. I’m proud to share some of the highlights of our year.
On track to achieve our 2021 financial goals 
We increased adjusted earnings per share by 9% in 2019 despite lower-than-usual organic growth due to challenging market conditions. In this slower top-line growth environment, our focus has been on protecting our margins in our base 
businesses, while driving faster-than-average 
growth in high value product categories, such as RFID. We are executing well on both fronts, while investing to drive future growth and strengthen our competitive position.
At the business level, LGM expanded its operating 
margin despite modest organic growth, and delivered solid volume improvement in the second half of the year; IHM made substantial progress toward its 2021 profitability target for the segment; and RBIS improved margins significantly on 5% organic top-line growth, driven largely by RFID. RFID sales again grew more than 20% as we continued to penetrate retail apparel, while significantly expanding our business development 
pipeline from other market segments. Our recent 
acquisition of Smartrac’s transponder division further bolsters this platform.
Advancing sustainability 
We continued to advance toward achieving our 
2025 sustainability goals, through increased focus 
and innovation. As of September 2019, we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30% compared to our 2015 baseline, exceeding our 2025 goal well ahead of schedule; over 88% of our paper is now certified to be sustainably-sourced; and our top-notch employee engagement score 
further improved to 82%.
All-in-all, 2019 was another solid year. As we 
reflect back on the last few years, we are pleased with how we have leveraged our foundational strengths in operational excellence and innovation 
to consistently make progress towards our 
long-term goals to deliver GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital. We have driven outsized growth in high value segments, while also growing profitably in our base businesses. We have substantially reduced the environmental impact of our operations while increasing our development of innovative, more environmentally-friendly products. We have continually driven productivity that has enabled us to ramp up our pace of investment in 
high value product categories, particularly RFID, 
while also expanding margins.
Starting this year, we’re presenting our financial 
results and sustainability achievements in a single report because, for us, it’s all one story, reflected 
in our business strategies, in how we work day-
to-day and in the value we created for all of our stakeholders in 2019. 
That value reflects the dedication and passion of our 
talented, values-driven team worldwide. On behalf of them, thank you for your interest in our company.

Learn more about our efforts on the sustainability section of our website.2025 Goals 2019 Progress
We will reduce absolute 
greenhouse gas emissions by 3% year-over-year, with 
at least a 26% reduction 
compared to our 2015 baseline.As of September 30, 2019, we reduced emissions by more than 30% against 
our baseline.
We will source 100% 
certified paper, of which at least 70% will be Forest Stewardship Council
® 
(FSC)-certified.Over 88% of our paper is 
certified. Close to 79% of our 
face paper is FSC-certified.
Our operations will be 95% landfill-free, with 75% of our waste repurposed.As of November 2019, 94% of waste from our operations was diverted from landfills and we recycled 65% of our waste.
We will maintain world class safety and engagement scores.We achieved a world-class Recordable Incident Rate of 0.23. We achieved a first-rate 82% 
employee engagement score.
We will cultivate a diverse 
workforce with 40% of leadership positions filled 
by women.34% of our manager level 
and above positions were filled by women, up from 
27% in 2015.In 2015, we set out to reach eight sustainability goals by 2025. We have since 
made steady progress toward nearly all of them. Here are some highlights:

In LGM, our high value categories once again grew faster than our base business. As an example, our wine and spirits labels in North America and Europe, where brands seeking a luxury look-
and-feel continued to drive demand for premium 
materials like our Wet Strength
™, Estate Label™, 
cotton range and PLUS products. Our wraps reign Supreme
In Graphics Solutions, our close engagement with end customers, innovative wrap-visualization technology and increased applications in markets beyond vehicle-wrapping, such as window films and paint 
protection films, helped drive continued 
growth, awareness and penetration of our colorful, exceptionally durable Supreme Wrapping
™ film and the digitally printable 
cast films in our MPI 1000™ series.Achieving Outsized Growth in 
High Value Categories
We drove growth in high value categories across our 
businesses in 2019, including intelligent labels, external 
embellishments, graphics and specialty labels.

phenomenal growth
We continued to build upon our RFID business in 2019, as more brands discovered the advantages in supply chain management, consumer 
engagement and sustainability that come with 
giving every physical product a unique digital identity, connecting it to the Internet of Things. We built on our momentum in the apparel segment while deepening relationships and gaining ground in beauty, logistics and food. In all, our pipeline of customer engagements increased 50%, driven primarily by categories outside of apparel.
We also enhanced our competitive advantage in 
intelligent labels with our acquisition of Smartrac’s 
RFID transponder (inlay) business, which closed in the first quarter of 2020. Smartrac’s capabilities complement our existing product offerings and process technologies and expand our Intelligent Labels platform to better serve industrial and retail segments. Smartrac’s global manufacturing footprint also complements our own. With the addition of Smartrac, our RFID business is 
expected to deliver annual sales in excess of 
$500 million, growing 15% to 20% annually over the long term.External Embellishments scores big  
with pro soccerRBIS’s 2019 growth was driven by significant expansion in the business’s high value segments. One prestigious new contract: RBIS was named the 
official supplier for jersey names and numbers for 
Premier League
® football in the U.K. Our innovative 
new product improved overall sustainability through the use of water-based inks, as well as advanced printing and robotics processes that reduce manufacturing scrap, and a partnership to recycle 
downstream waste from the application of our 
products into material for food trays.
Industrial tapes grows by 
innovating for converters 
As an innovative means of supporting 
converters, the industrial tapes team introduced our Core Series
™ portfolio, an 
easy-to-use product line consisting of streamlined offerings that cover the breadth of adhesive technologies that converters require for a wide variety of applications. 
The Core Series is designed to provide an 
effortless customer experience, enabling easy product selection based on adhesive characteristics and bonding substrates.

efficiency in Europe
To better meet customer needs while positioning 
the business for long-term profitable growth, in the first quarter of 2019, we completed a multi-year recapitalization plan for LGM in Europe. We completed a 12,000-square-
meter expansion of our plant at Rodange, 
Luxembourg. New, state-of-the-art equipment in the expanded facility strengthens product quality and maximizes production uptime. It gives our European team a more agile network, increases our topcoating capabilities and helps us better address fluctuations in customer demand. It also helps reduce our carbon emissions by positioning us closer to customers and reducing the need for transport during production. With the added capacity of the plant, along with incremental capacity from our acquisition of the European 
business of Mactac in 2016, we were able to 
optimize our footprint, closing a plant in Schwelm, Germany and transferring its production to Soignies, Belgium and our expanded plant in Rodange. We continued to improve profitability in our base businesses by 
optimizing for efficiency, innovating in anticipation of customer needs 
and finding new ways to deliver our signature service and expertise.Growing Profitably in Our Base Businesses

customer automation
RBIS recently renewed its focus on innovation, and in 2019 that was especially evident in its Apparel Solutions business. Garment manufacturers around 
the world are turning to automation to meet 
demands for faster delivery and lower costs. Within Apparel Solutions, our Factory Solutions team is developing a portfolio that supports automation with novel solutions that address some of the industry’s biggest challenges. These include in-line equipment that automatically applies pressure-sensitive labels to tags, polybags and other products; sonic welding machines that eliminate the need to manually assemble multi-page care 
and content labels; and new sock-packaging 
automation solutions that open up a new market to RBIS. These solutions are differentiating Avery Dennison and creating significant new revenue opportunities for Apparel Solutions.
Growth and innovation in variable 
information (VI) materials
In collaboration with LGM, our Printer Solutions 
Division developed the EcoCut
™ labeling solution, 
which delivers on-demand flexibility in label length while optimizing the amount of material consumed. The team also managed a smooth transition to a portfolio of materials for direct thermal printing that 
complies with a new European regulation banning 
the use of bisphenol A. 
In late 2019, the team also introduced our Surfas
™ 
technology, a breakthrough adhesive for applying 
labels to corrugated board and other rough substrates used by shippers and other users of VI labels. 
Continued growth in India and Vietnam
Emerging markets continued to deliver above-
average growth for both our LGM and RBIS businesses. In LGM, our operations in India continue to drive expansion of the pressure-sensitive segment through deeper penetration in the growing packaged goods category, delivering differentiated shelf appeal and increased productivity in the value chain compared to other labeling technologies. A comprehensive product range, consistent quality and 
service, a national footprint and a strong local team 
have enabled the business to grow much faster than the industry and deliver increased returns in 2019.
In RBIS, our operations in Vietnam continued 
to be among our fastest growing, due in part to brands migrating some of their sourcing out of China. RBIS Vietnam has achieved double-digit growth for the last five years, keeping pace with 
demand through disciplined capital investment, 
and creating our largest RBIS hub outside of China. In 2019, as in recent years, our Vietnam team delivered outstanding performance in quality, reliability and service, while maintaining an exemplary safety record and some of our highest employee engagement scores in Asia.

Our ClearIntent™ Portfolio
The Avery Dennison ClearIntent Portfolio contains 
hundreds of products that help our customers and their end-users reduce their environmental footprint, satisfy consumer demand and stay ahead of regulations. ClearIntent Portfolio products 
demonstrably reduce environmental impact by 
meeting one or more of these criteria:
• Reducing material usage.
• Improving recyclability.
• Increasing recycled content in the end product.
• Being responsibly sourced.One standout ClearIntent product is our award-
winning CleanFlake™ technology. CleanFlake 
helps facilitate the recycling of PET containers by 
enabling clean separation of the label’s facestock 
and adhesive during the recycling process, resulting 
in pure PET flakes that can be recycled into food-
grade recycled PET (rPET). We’ve expanded our CleanFlake portfolio into a comprehensive range of products to enable broader recycling of PET plastic. 
To include more recycled content in our products 
and help develop the market for recycled materials, we introduced a number of recycled-content Across our company, we’re engineering 
materials intended to help humanity move 
towards an economy in which resources 
cycle through use and reuse for as long as possible, and in which waste and pollution 
are vastly reduced. We’re focused on 
enabling recyclability and expanding the use of recycled content.  In 2019, as part of our 
commitment, we joined the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation’s Circular Economy 100 (CE 100) network, which provides collaborative 
opportunities for advancing the circular 
economy among businesses, governments, universities and other thought leaders.

solutions for both film and paper. Our recycled PET 
(rPET) liner uses 30% post-consumer waste and 
won the Environmental and Sustainability Award 
at the 2019 Label Industry Global Awards. Our 
rBG liner contains 15% post-consumer waste. 
Both cost the same as conventional liners and deliver the same ease of conversion and smooth dispensing, while also offering savings in water use, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions. 
We also introduced several new facestocks made 
with recycled content. Our recycled polyethylene (rPE) facestock, made with 30% recycled PE 
resin, helps reduce petroleum consumption while delivering a more natural look. For wine and 
spirits brands, we launched our Crush Range
™ 
line of paper facestocks made of recycled paper 
and organic waste, which aim to boost shelf 
appeal while signaling environmental integrity. 
Converters and brands can choose from facestocks made with 15% grape, citrus, or barley 
waste, along with 40% FSC-certified recycled 
paper, as well as new paper facestocks with 30% 
to 100% recycled content and unique textures 
and finishes to inspire creativity.

To make sustainability progress at a meaningful 
scale, we have to reach beyond our own operations and engage our customers, suppliers and peers. Back in 2013, with the help of the Rainforest Alliance, we adopted a responsible-sourcing policy 
for the paper we use in our products. In 2015, we 
set a formal goal for responsible paper sourcing: aiming to certify the sources of 100% of our paper by 2025, with at least 70% of that volume being certified by the FSC. That same year, we offered our FSC-certified products at price parity as a way to bring our customers along with us. 
Since then, with the enthusiastic buy-in of 
suppliers and customers, we’ve made steady 
progress toward achieving our goal. As of the 
end of 2019, more than 88% of our paper was certified, and close to 79% of our face paper was FSC-certified. More important, the practice of responsible paper-sourcing has gained a foothold in our industry and is expected to continue to increase. 
We’ve taken a similarly collaborative approach 
to eliminating the byproduct created in the label 
manufacturing process—the liner and matrix left 
over after our label materials are applied. We began by connecting customers with local recyclers that can collect and process their label waste. In late 2019, we took that effort to a new level by creating an industrywide group to focus on developing a single platform communicating the recycling capabilities offered throughout the industry. Suppliers, recyclers and other pressure-sensitive label manufacturers will continue to collaborate 
during 2020 to establish an industry recycling 
program in North America and Europe, with the ultimate aim of expanding globally.

from RBIS
Much of the focus on innovation in RBIS is 
aimed at advancing sustainability. In May 2019, RBIS announced its 10 Solutions for Sustainable Change, which include products that promote apparel recycling, 
yarn made from recycled polyester, kraft 
paper alternatives for plastic e-commerce packaging and intelligent labels that give consumers access to information, such as a product’s provenance and its recyclability, via their mobile devices. 
One of the 10 Solutions is our ongoing 
support for the Plastic Bank, a social enterprise working to eliminate ocean plastic by preventing it from getting into waterways. We allocate a portion of the licensing fees from our patented clothing labels made from recycled polyester, which the Plastic Bank uses to establish recycling centers in impoverished communities. At the 
centers, residents turn in plastic for credits 
they can use to purchase cooking fuel, school tuition and more. The plastic is then recycled and kept out of the waste stream.Fighting food waste with RFID
Among the benefits of item-level tagging with our RFID inlays is the ability to better manage inventory and produce more efficiently. In the food segment alone, the opportunities for reducing waste are enormous—the United 
Nations estimates that about 30% of all food 
produced is wasted, and both the U.N. and the U.S. government have set a goal of reducing food waste by 50% by 2030. Our RFID solutions enable grocers and others in the food industry to better align harvest and inventory with demand, manage expiry more effectively, monitor temperatures more closely to avoid spoilage and remove only affected items during recalls. Based on pilot studies, we believe RFID tagging can help grocers reduce food 
waste by as much as 20%.
Offsetting our GHG emissions 
by investing in windWe’ve already exceeded our 2025 goal for greenhouse gas reduction, lowering our emissions by nearly one-third compared to our 2015 baseline. And we continue to find ways to further reduce or offset emissions. In November 2018, we 
signed a virtual power purchase agreement with 
Plum Creek Wind in Nebraska. The project, which is expected to come online this year, will bring an additional 230 megawatts of renewable energy to the U.S. electrical grid, and our 30-megawatt off-take from the project will enable us to offset approximately 75% of our U.S. operations’ annual greenhouse gas emissions from electricity—about 99,000 metric tons worth.

including our employees and our neighbors. That means 
fostering an environment that enables individuals to be 
and do their best, whether in one of our business locations 
or in the broader communities where they reside. 
Maintaining a world-class safety rate
Across our company, our safety performance remained strong in 2019. On average, 75% of our facilities are free of recordable injuries each year, and our global Recordable Incident Rate 
of 0.23 in 2019 was significantly lower than the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration manufacturing industry average of 3.5 (the most recently available industry average). As of the publication of this report, 33% of our facilities have operated injury-free for more than five years.
Promoting diversity and inclusion
A diverse global workforce and an inclusive culture are essential to our remaining at the forefront of 
materials science and manufacturing. One way we 
support employees bringing their whole selves to the workplace is through our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), launched in 2019. ERGs bring together employees who have shared interests and a common desire to make Avery Dennison an open and inclusive workplace. Currently, our ERGs include nine groups focused on driving inclusion and advancement for women, employees of color, 
LGBTQ+ employees, veterans and others.
Leveraging our employees’ 
passion to strengthen local 
communities
We have a long history of supporting 
the communities where we live and do business. We make most of our community investments through the Avery Dennison Foundation, and our employees also 
organize additional giving and volunteer 
efforts. In all of our giving, we focus on efforts that can effect measurable change, particularly in the areas of education, sustainability and women’s empowerment.

looking statements, and financial or other business targets, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause
our actual results to differ materially from the expected results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements.
We believe that the most significant risk factors that could affect our financial performance in the near-term include:
(1) the impacts to underlying demand for our products and/or foreign currency fluctuations from global economic
conditions, political uncertainty, and changes in governmental regulations; (2) competitors’ actions, including pricing,
expansion in key markets, and product offerings; (3) the degree to which higher costs can be offset with productivity
measures and/or passed on to customers through price increases, without a significant loss of volume; and (4) the execution
and integration of acquisitions.
Certain risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 28, 2019 and include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the following: fluctuations in
demand affecting sales to customers; worldwide and local economic and market conditions; changes in political conditions;
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations, including in emerging
markets; changes in our markets due to competitive conditions, technological developments, laws and regulations, and
customer preferences; fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and energy; changes in governmental laws
and regulations; the impact of competitive products and pricing; the financial condition and inventory strategies of
customers; our ability to generate sustained productivity improvement; our ability to achieve and sustain targeted cost
reductions; loss of significant contracts or customers; collection of receivables from customers; selling prices; business mix
shift; execution and integration of acquisitions; product and service quality; timely development and market acceptance of
new products, including sustainable or sustainably-sourced products; investment in development activities and new
production facilities; amounts of future dividends and share repurchases; customer and supplier concentrations or
consolidations; fluctuations in interest and tax rates; changes in tax laws and regulations, and uncertainties associated with
interpretations of such laws and regulations; retention of tax incentives; outcome of tax audits; successful implementation of
new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment; disruptions in information technology
systems, including cyber-attacks or other intrusions to network security; successful installation of new or upgraded
information technology systems; data security breaches; volatility of financial markets; impairment of capitalized assets,
including goodwill and other intangibles; credit risks; our ability to obtain adequate financing arrangements and maintain
access to capital; the realization of deferred tax assets; interest rates and our debt covenants; fluctuations in pension,
insurance, and employee benefit costs; goodwill impairment; the impact of legal and regulatory proceedings, including
with respect to environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and trade compliance; protection and infringement of
intellectual property; the impact of epidemiological events on the economy and our customers and suppliers; acts of war,
terrorism, and natural disasters; and other factors.
Our forward-looking statements are made only as of the date hereof. We assume no duty to update these forward-
looking statements to reflect new, changed or unanticipated events or circumstances, other than as may be required by law.

55The consolidated financial statements and accompanying information are the responsibility of and were prepared by
management. The statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America and, as such, include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.
Oversight of management’s financial reporting and internal accounting control responsibilities is exercised by our
Board of Directors, through its Audit and Finance Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors. The
Committee meets periodically with financial management, internal auditors and our independent registered public
accounting firm to obtain reasonable assurance that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning
auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm and our
internal audit department have free access to, and periodically meet with, the Audit and Finance Committee without
management present.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as that
term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15(d)-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under
the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) , management has concluded that internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 28, 2019. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein.

55STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Avery Dennison Corporation 2019 Annual Report56Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Avery Dennison Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Avery Dennison Corporation and its subsidiaries
(the ‘‘Company’’) as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, of
comprehensive income, of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 28, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the ‘‘consolidated financial statements’’). We also
have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on criteria established
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for leases in 2019.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
56 2019 Annual Report Avery Dennison Corporation57as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated
financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.
Goodwill Impairment Assessment of One Reporting Unit in the Industrial and Healthcare Materials (‘‘IHM’’) Reportable
Segment
As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance
was $930.8 million as of December 28, 2019, of which $173.7 million related to the Company’s IHM reportable segment.
Management performs an annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter, unless certain factors indicate the
need to perform an impairment assessment in addition to the annual test. Potential impairment is identified by comparing
the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, and, to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an
impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. The goodwill of one
reporting unit in the Company’s IHM reportable segment was tested utilizing a quantitative assessment. Management’s
quantitative analysis primarily consists of a present value (discounted cash flow) method to determine the fair value of the
reporting units with goodwill. A discounted cash flow analysis requires management to make various assumptions about the
reporting units, including forecasted sales, operating margins and growth rates, and discount rates. Assumptions are also
made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment
assessment of one reporting unit in the IHM reportable segment is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment
by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting unit. This in turn led to a high degree of
auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating management’s cash flow projections
and significant assumptions, including forecasted sales, operating margins and growth rates, discount rates and perpetual
growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit
evidence obtained.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s
reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value
estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method; testing the completeness, accuracy, and
relevance of underlying data used in the estimate; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management,
including forecasted sales, operating margins and growth rates, discount rates and perpetual growth rates for periods
beyond the long-term business plan period. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to forecasted sales, operating
margins and growth rates, involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering
(i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and
(iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow method and
certain significant assumptions, including discount rates and perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term
business plan.

58Income Taxes
As described in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income tax in the
U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, whereby management applies judgment in evaluating and estimating the Company’s
worldwide provision, accruals for taxes and deferred taxes and for evaluating the Company’s tax positions. The Company
recorded a benefit from income taxes of $56.7 million, total net deferred tax assets of $186.9 million and unrecognized tax
benefits of $69.9 million as of and for the year-ended December 28, 2019. Significant judgments and estimates are required
by management when determining the Company’s tax expense and evaluating tax positions, including uncertainties.
Management’s estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to management’s assessment of relevant
facts and circumstances existing at the balance sheet date, as well as existing laws, regulations and practices of any
governmental authorities exercising jurisdiction over the Company’s operations. Management’s assessment of the future
realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets relies heavily on forecasted earnings in certain jurisdictions, and such
forecasted earnings are determined by the manner in which the Company operates its business.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes is a critical
audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in accounting for income taxes, including evaluating the
potential outcome of various uncertain tax issues and the realizability of deferred tax assets. This in turn led to a high degr ee
of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate the potential outcome of uncertain tax
issues and the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis. In addition, the audit effort involved the use o f
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit
evidence obtained.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
relating to accounting for income taxes, including controls over uncertain tax issues and the realizability of deferred tax
assets on a jurisdictional basis. These procedures also included testing the income tax provision, including the rate
reconciliation, return to provision adjustments in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Evaluating management’s
assessment related to the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues included evaluating management’s assessment of
existing laws, regulations and practices of governmental authorities exercising jurisdiction over the Company’s operations.
Evaluating management’s process for assessing the future realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis
included evaluating estimates of future taxable income, evaluating management’s application of income tax law, and testing
the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in management’s assessment. Evaluating management’s estimates
of future taxable income involved evaluating whether the estimates used by management were reasonable considering the
current and past performance of the Company on a jurisdictional basis and whether the estimates were consistent with
evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgment and estimates, including the application of relevant foreign and
domestic income tax laws and regulations, the provision for income taxes and the reasonableness of management’s
assessments of whether certain tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained.

as specialty labels, graphics, industrial tapes and radio-frequency identification (RFID));
•Growing profitably in our base businesses  through tailored go-to-market strategies and disciplined
execution;
•Advancing sustainability  in our operations and throughout value chains; and
•Fostering well-being and diversity in our teams.

iiIn addition, we continue to focus on the following financial priorities:
•Maintaining our relentless focus on productivity  through continued operational excellence and enterprise
lean sigma; and
•Deploying capital effectively  by balancing our investments in organic growth, productivity and acquisitions,
while returning cash to stockholders.
Strong 2019 Performance and Continued Execution of Strategic Priorities.   In fiscal year 2019, we delivered another
year of strong adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth and operating margin expansion.  We achieved most of our
financial goals for the year, with the performance highlights described below.
• Achieved net sales of approximately $7.1 billion,  a decrease of 1.2% over prior year due to the impact of
foreign currency translation.
• Excluding the impact of currency, sales grew by 2.0%.  On an organic basis, sales also grew by 2.0%, as
growth in high value product categories more than offset a modest decline in our base businesses.
•Reported EPS decreased from $5.28 in 2018 to $3.57 in 2019  reflecting settlement charges resulting from
the 2018 termination of our U.S. pension plan.
• Adjusted EPS increased from $6.06 to $6.60 due to higher volume and benefits from productivity initiatives,
partially offset by higher employee-related costs and the impact of foreign currency translation.  Adjusted EPS
was above the midpoint of the $6.45 to $6.70 annual guidance range we provided to investors in January 2019.
• With net cash provided by operating activities of $746.5 million , delivered free cash flow of $512.3 million.
• On net income of $303.6 million  and removing the impact of our negative tax rate in 2019 due to the
termination of our U.S. pension plan, achieved return on total capital (ROTC) of 11.9%.  Excluding the impact
of pension plan settlements and a discrete foreign tax structuring transaction, adjusted ROTC was 19.6%.
Sales change excluding the impact of currency (sales change ex. currency), organic sales change, adjusted EPS, free
cash flow, ROTC and adjusted ROTC are supplemental financial measures that we provide to assist investors in assessing
our performance and operating trends.  They are defined, qualified and reconciled from generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the last section of this proxy statement.  These non-GAAP financial
measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for or superior to, the comparable financial measures under
GAAP .

Delivering Financial Targets.   In March 2017, we announced five-year financial goals through 2021, including targets
for organic sales growth, GAAP operating margin, adjusted EPS growth and ROTC.  The combination of our growth and
ROTC targets is a proxy for growth in economic value added (EVA), one of the performance objectives used in our long-term
incentive (LTI) compensation program.  As shown on the following page, based on our results for the first three years of this
five-year period, we are largely on track to deliver these commitments.

Disciplined Capital Allocation.   We have been consistently disciplined in executing our approach to capital allocation,
balancing our investments in organic growth, productivity and acquisitions with continuing to return cash to stockholders
through dividends and share repurchases. In 2019, on net income of $303.6 million, we delivered adjusted ROTC of
nearly 20% while investing $257.2 million in capital expenditures to support future growth and further productivity
improvement.  In addition, we paid $189.7 million in dividends and repurchased $237.7 million in shares of our
common stock.
We have invested in our businesses to support organic growth and pursued targeted acquisitions that support our
strategy of increasing our exposure to high value product categories.  Our spending on capital expenditures in 2019 was
comparable to prior year as we continued investing to enable the future growth of our businesses, improve our profitability
and expand our margins.  Last November, we announced our agreement to acquire the Transponder (RFID inlay) Division of
Smartrac, a leader in the development and manufacture of RFID products.  Together with our Intelligent Labels business,
this acquisition will create a platform with over $500 million in annual revenue, offering long-term growth and profitability,
enhanced research and development capabilities, expanded product lines and additional manufacturing capacity.  We
completed this acquisition in February 2020.  During 2019, we also made equity investments in two start-up companies
developing innovative technological solutions.
In 2019, we deployed $427.4 million to (i) repurchase 2.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $237.7 million and
(ii) pay an annual dividend of $2.26 per share for an aggregate amount of $189.7 million.  Given the higher price of our
common stock in 2019, we allocated less capital to share repurchases in 2019 than in 2018, a year in which our stock price
had significantly declined in the second half; however, as shown in the graph on the following page the amount repurchased
was comparable to the average amount repurchased over the prior four years.  We have paid quarterly dividends for
decades and most recently raised our quarterly dividend rate by approximately 12% in April 2019 .  As shown in the

Three- and Five-Year Cumulative TSR Outperformance.   As shown below, we achieved total stockholder return
(TSR) of over 48% in 2019, and delivered cumulative TSR for the 2017-2019 three-year period and the 2015-2019
five-year period that substantially outperformed the S&P 500 /H23006 and the median of the S&P 500 Industrials and
Materials subsets. We compare ourselves to the median of the S&P 500 Industrials and Materials subsets because we are a
member of the Materials subset, and also share many characteristics with members of the Industrials subset. This practice is
further informed by feedback from investors, who have indicated that they look at both subsets in evaluating our
performance relative to that of our peers.  We focus on TSR because it measures the return we provide to our stockholders,
including stock price appreciation and dividends paid (assuming reinvestment of dividends).
Although we experienced strong TSR in 2019, we continue to believe that our longer-term TSR is a more meaningful
measure of our performance than our one-year TSR, which can be significantly impacted by short-term market volatility that
may be unrelated to our underlying performance.  For example, although we delivered strong financial results in 2018 –
exceeding the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance for the year – our TSR for that year was negative, as was the TSR of
each of the comparator groups shown below.

In advance of the 2019 Annual Meeting, we contacted our 35 largest institutional stockholders, representing
approximately 61% of our then-outstanding shares.  Board members, including our Lead Independent Director, and
management were made available to answer questions and address concerns regarding the items being brought before the
stockholder vote.  While we received responses from stockholders representing over 30% of our then-outstanding shares,
only one of them desired to substantively engage at that busy time.  Respondents declining meetings indicated that they
did not have any concerns warranting discussion during proxy season.
In the fall, without the time pressures associated with proxy season, we contacted our 30 largest institutional
stockholders, representing over 62% of our then-outstanding shares, to request a meeting with our Lead Independent
Director and/or management.  We received responses from stockholders representing nearly 60% of our then-outstanding
shares and spoke with stockholders representing approximately 35% of our then-outstanding shares. We substantively
engaged with every stockholder who requested to do so, and our Lead Independent Director led half of these
engagements.  We also discussed the results of our fall engagement with the Compensation and Executive Personnel
Committee (the ‘‘Compensation Committee’’) and the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee of our Board.
Our off-season meetings focused on potential changes in the Compensation Committee’s approach to CEO
compensation, as well as our non-employee directors’ commitments as they relate to overboarding concerns. We
also answered questions regarding our business strategies and financial performance; executive compensation
and HCM matters; Board composition and refreshment process; and other ESG matters, including our progress
towards achieving our 2025 sustainability goals.

Our Board and management believe that regular stockholder engagement fosters a deeper understanding of investors’
evolving expectations on ESG matters, as well as executive compensation and HCM matters.  We look forward to
continuing our longstanding practice of engaging in dialogue with our stockholders to ensure our programs continue to
align with best practices.
ESG Matters
With respect to matters related to governance, we discussed topics related to our Board composition and its
succession planning and refreshment processes , as well as the skills, commitments, tenure, and diversity of our
directors.  We also commented on our stockholder rights  profile.  In addition, we discussed our Board’s oversight
of our business strategies and related risks; progress towards achieving our 2025 sustainability goals ,
including with respect to plastic recyclability and how our businesses are adapting to the risks and opportunities
presented by climate change; and audit matters  such as the tenure of our independent auditor.
Executive Compensation and HCM Matters
With respect to executive compensation, we discussed the linkage between our incentive compensation and
business strategies.  We also reviewed our approach to HCM, including our executive leadership development
and succession planning  processes, diversity and inclusion  initiatives and employee engagement  scores.  We
also reported on the Compensation Committee’s robust oversight of these priorities.
Sustainability is one of our core values and has long been an integral part of our approach to doing business.  Our aim is
to improve the sustainability of our products and processes while helping to create shared value for all of our stakeholders.
Key to our progress has been integrating sustainability into our underlying business strategies and engaging employees at
all levels.
In the integrated annual report in which this proxy statement is included, we present highlights of our achievements
against our 2025 sustainability goals.  In the first five years of the 10-year horizon for these goals, we have made meaningful
progress.  We encourage you to review these highlights, as well as our sustainability scorecard shown on the following page.

Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy StatementviiiOur Board provides strong oversight of our management team and company, with the following notable
accomplishments in recent years:
• Successful execution of our business strategies, which has delivered strong compound annual organic sales
growth, operating margin expansion, and double-digit compound adjusted EPS growth in the first three
years of the five-year horizon reflected in our financial targets through 2021, as well as TSR over the most
recent three- and five-year periods of approximately 96% and 180%, respectively, in each case substantially
outperforming the S&P 500;
• The completion of six acquisitions and equity investments in six other companies, in each case consistent with
our disciplined approach to acquisitions and investments through which we target companies that can
enhance our existing capabilities and increase our exposure to high value product categories;
• Orderly executive leadership development and succession planning, with experienced leaders promoted to
CEO and CFO and effectively transitioning into their roles; and
• Thoughtful Board refreshment and succession planning, with four new independent directors appointed to
our Board in the last seven years, three of whom increased the racial, ethnic or gender diversity on our Board,
as well as two long-serving directors departing from our Board to focus on other endeavors.
Departure of Current Lead Independent Director; Post-Annual Meeting Board Leadership Structure
In February 2020, our Lead Independent Director, David Pyott, notified our Board of his intention not to stand for
reelection at the Annual Meeting so that he may focus on other endeavors.  As a result, Mr. Pyott’s membership on our
Board will end on the date of the Annual Meeting.  Our Board actively reviews its composition and the need for refreshment,
and determined not to appoint an additional director at this time but may decide to do so in the future.
In light of Mr. Pyott’s upcoming departure, in February 2020, the Governance Committee evaluated our Board
leadership structure and recommended to our Board that Patrick Siewert be selected to serve as Lead Independent
Director.  The committee’s decision took into account his significant contribution to the Board’s responsibility of maintaining
the integrity of our financial statements as a member of the Audit and Finance Committee for the past 15 years and its Chair
for the past four years, as well as his extensive international experience in Asia, a region in which nearly 35% of our sales a re
generated and approximately 60% of our employees are located.  With Mr. Pyott’s departure, the Governance Committee
determined that Mr. Siewert is best positioned to provide independent leadership of our Board in overseeing our strategies
to drive long-term value creation for our key stakeholders of customers, employees, investors and communities.  Upon the
recommendation of the Governance Committee, the independent directors on our Board unanimously selected Mr. Siewert
(with him and Mr. Pyott abstaining) to serve as our Lead Independent Director, effective immediately after the Annual
Meeting subject to his reelection.  A description of responsibilities of our Lead Independent Director can be found on
page 11 of this proxy statement.

The Compensation Committee designs our executive compensation program to motivate our executives to execute
our business strategies and create long-term value for our stakeholders.  The program delivers pay for performance, with
realized compensation dependent on our company achieving rigorous annual and long-term financial performance targets
and value creation objectives that advance the interests of our stockholders.
Target total direct compensation (TDC) for our Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is comprised of the following three
components:
• Base salary;
• Performance-based annual cash incentive award under our Annual Incentive Plan (AIP); and
• Long-term incentives (LTIs) delivered in performance-based equity awards, consisting 50% of performance
units (PUs) and 50% of market-leveraged stock units (MSUs).
The Compensation Committee establishes the target TDC of our NEOs to incent strong operational and financial
performance and stockholder value creation, generally giving consideration to the market median, role responsibilities,
individual performance, tenure, retention and succession. The majority of this compensation is performance-based,
meaning that these executives ultimately may not realize some of these components of TDC if we fail to achieve our
financial objectives.

Over the past five years, our cumulative TSR has increased by nearly 180% while the annual compensation of our CEO

Over the last few years, the Compensation Committee discussed how best to ensure that it is compensating our CEO
optimally and in alignment with the long-term interests of our stockholders.  The committee’s objectives were to:
• Recognize our company’s performance and delivery of value to our customers, employees, investors and
communities during his four-year tenure as our CEO;
• Enhance his incentive to continue creating value for these stakeholders, including by driving superior TSR for
our investors; and
• Encourage his retention for the long term.
The committee also sought to maintain market-competitive target TDC for him that is well-aligned with our company’s
performance and ensure that his target TDC does not fall substantially below the market median, without relying on the
traditional approach of periodic incremental increases to the components of his TDC – base salary, target AIP award
opportunity and target LTI award opportunity – to maintain consistency with a continually rising market median.
xiPAY FOR PERFORMANCE
CHANGES IN APPROACH TO CEO COMPENSATION FOR 2020
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy StatementxiiAfter extensive discussion, and giving consideration to the feedback received from dialogue with some of our
largest stockholders , the Compensation Committee determined to eliminate potential annual increases to our CEO’s base
salary and target AIP and LTI opportunities in favor of an even longer-term approach that would hold his target TDC
constant for a three-year period.  During the three-year period, the Compensation Committee retains the discretion to
review our CEO’s target TDC if market conditions or company results warrant a change.  At the end of the period, the
Compensation Committee plans to evaluate both his and our company’s performance and market conditions before
determining the appropriate level of his compensation, continuing to give consideration to factors such as individual
performance, tenure, retention and succession. This approach to CEO compensation is intended to be more consistent
with the long-term approach we take to planning our strategies, setting our financial targets and sustainability goals,
creating value for our stockholders, developing an engaged and diverse workforce, and investing in the communities
in which we operate.
To ensure our CEO’s compensation determined in 2020 remains competitive and mitigate the potential for his target
TDC to substantially trail behind his peers in the next three years, the Compensation Committee determined to set his
target TDC modestly above market median, recognizing that his base salary had not increased in the previous two years and
his target AIP opportunity had not increased since he became CEO in 2016.  The committee intends to make no additional
increases until 2023.  Anticipating that the median for market will continue to grow at historical rates, the Compensation
Committee determined to set our CEO’s compensation package roughly halfway between the current 50th and
75th percentiles of his market peers, with the expectation that – at the end of the three-year period during which Mr. Butier’s
compensation is expected not to increase – his TDC would be at or around the market median. This approach is consistent
with the approach taken by the Compensation Committee with respect to recommending to our Board the compensation of
our non-employee directors.
Based on 2019 market pay rates and projected 2020 market pay rates for companies with a market capitalization
between $6 billion and $10 billion, and with the expert advice and recommendation of its independent compensation
consultant, Willis Towers Watson, the Compensation Committee determined to set Mr. Butier’s target TDC for 2020 at
$9.9 million by increasing (i) his base salary by 6% to $1.2 million, noting that his base salary had not been increased in the
previous two years; (ii) his target AIP opportunity from 125% of base salary, the same level as when he became CEO in 2016,
to 140% of base salary; and (iii) his target LTI opportunity from 475% of base salary to 585% of base salary. The
Compensation Committee noted that over 90% of this increase consists of at-risk, performance-based compensation.
These targets are not expected to increase during the next three years, but could decrease if warranted by market
conditions or our company results.  Mr. Butier’s realized compensation will be dependent on our company achieving strong
TSR performance, delivering our 2021 financial targets and 2025 sustainability goals, and continuing to serve our
customers, engage our employees, and invest in the communities in which we operate.

PwC is very well qualified to act as our independent registered public accounting firm and has a deep understanding of our
operations and accounting practices.  The Audit and Finance Committee considered the qualifications, performance, and
independence of PwC, the quality of its discussions with PwC, and the fees charged by PwC for the level and quality of
services provided during 2019, and determined that the reappointment of PwC is in the best interest of our company and
stockholders.

1PROXY STATEMENT
GOVERNANCE, SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
GOVERNANCE
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement2We have adopted a Code of Ethics that requires our CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Accounting Officer
(CAO) to act professionally and ethically in fulfilling their responsibilities.
• Our CEO, CFO and CAO must avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest  and disclose any material
transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to raise a conflict of interest to the Governance
Committee.
• In addition, they must:
•Ensure that our SEC filings are complete and accurate  and contain understandable information;
•Respect the confidentiality of information  acquired in the course of the performance of their
responsibilities;
•Employ corporate assets responsibly ; and
•Report violations  of our Code of Ethics to the Chair of either the Audit Committee or the Governance
Committee.
Supporting the principles reflected in our Code of Ethics, our controllership and internal audit functions ensure that we
maintain a robust internal control environment, with the leaders of these functions regularly reporting to, and periodically
meeting in executive session with, the Audit Committee.
Our Code of Ethics is available under Corporate Governance in the investors section of our website.  Only the Audit
Committee or the Governance Committee can amend or waive the provisions of the Code of Ethics, and any amendments
or waivers must be posted promptly on our website or timely filed with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.  We last
amended our Code of Ethics in April 2014.
Our Code of Conduct applies to all of our directors, officers and employees and reflects our values of Integrity,
Courage, External Focus, Diversity, Sustainability, Innovation, Teamwork and Excellence. It is available under Corporate
Governance in the investors section of our website and includes leadership messages, expanded information regarding
higher risk areas, and case studies to provide additional guidance on situations that raise more complex ethical questions.
Our Code of Conduct has been translated into over 30 languages and our leaders affirm their commitment to complying
with it when they first join our company and annually thereafter.  We train employees on the Code at least biannually, in
addition to our online training program generally consisting of four courses per year covering specific risk areas from the
Code that designated computer-based employees are required to complete.
To ensure that the policies and principles encompassed in our Code of Conduct reach all our employees, we develop
and launch ‘‘Talkabout’’ toolkits (also in over 30 languages) globally each year, which managers are required to use to
engage in meaningful discussion with their teams regarding topics from the Code of Conduct.  These toolkits consist of
presentation slides, a leader discussion guide and an introductory subtitled video, which includes messages from our Chief
Compliance Officer and other company leaders.
Ethics-Based Corporate Culture and Policies
Reflecting the culture of our company, the ethics-based corporate policies and other matters discussed in our Code of
Conduct are shown on the following page.  Our global supplier standards extend our commitment to many of these
principles to our third party service providers, establishing our expectation that they also do business in an ethical manner.

appropriate under the circumstances.
Stockholders and other interested parties interested in communicating regarding these matters may make a
confidential, anonymous report by contacting the GuideLine as described on the previous page or writing to the Audit and

3COMPLAINT PROCEDURES FOR ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING MATTERS
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement4Our stock ownership policy requires that non-employee directors acquire and maintain a minimum ownership
interest in our company of $500,000 and our CEO and other NEOs acquire and maintain a minimum ownership
interest in our company equal to 6x and 3x his or her annual base salary, respectively.  At least 50% of the applicable
minimum ownership level must be held in vested shares.
The values of the following shares/units are considered in measuring compliance with our stock ownership policy:
(i) shares beneficially owned or deemed to be beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, under federal securities laws;
(ii) shares or units held in qualified and non-qualified employee benefit plans; (iii) unvested restricted stock units (RSUs)
subject only to time-based vesting; and (iv) 50% of the value of unvested market-leveraged stock units (MSUs) at the target
payout level.  Neither unvested performance units (PUs) nor stock options are considered in measuring compliance with our
stock ownership policy.
If a director or officer fails to achieve or make reasonable progress towards achieving his or her respective
ownership level, he or she is required to retain shares acquired, net of taxes, from the exercise of stock options or
vesting of stock awards until such level is met.  Executives are not allowed to transact in company stock until they
certify that they will remain in compliance with our stock ownership policy after giving effect to the transaction they
plan to effectuate.
The Compensation Committee and the Governance Committee reviewed the stock ownership of our non-employee
directors in December 2019 and February 2020, respectively.  Both Committees noted that all of our non-employee
directors had exceeded the minimum ownership level required by the policy, except for Mark Barrenechea who
became a director in September 2018 and has five years to reach the minimum ownership level. The Committee noted
that, because he had made reasonable progress towards meeting the applicable level, Mr. Barrenechea was also in
compliance with the policy.  On average, the ownership of our non-employee directors was approximately 9x the minimum
ownership level, aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and further incenting their focus on long-term
stockholder value creation.
The Compensation Committee reviewed officer stock ownership in December 2019 and determined that all of our
NEOs were in compliance with our stock ownership policy.

2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation5Our insider trading policy prohibits our directors, officers and employees from (i) engaging in transactions in our
company’s stock while in the possession of material non-public information; (ii) engaging in transactions in the stock of other
companies while in possession of material non-public information that they become aware of in performing their duties; and
(iii) disclosing material non-public information to unauthorized persons outside our company.
Limited Trading Windows
Our insider trading policy restricts trading for directors and officers (including our NEOs) during blackout periods, which
generally begin two weeks before the end of each fiscal quarter and end two business days after the release of earnings for
the quarter.  Additional blackout periods may be imposed from time to time, with or without notice, depending on the
circumstances.
Prohibitions on Hedging and Pledging
Our insider trading policy expressly prohibits our directors, officers and employees from purchasing financial
instruments (such as prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds) designed to hedge or
offset any decrease in the market value of shares of our common stock they hold, directly or indirectly.  In addition, directors
and officers are expressly prohibited from – and our non-officer employees are strongly discouraged from – pledging
any of their shares of common stock to secure personal loans or other obligations , including by holding such shares in a
margin account.
To our knowledge, based on our review of their written representations in our annual director and officer
questionnaire, all of our directors and executive officers complied with our insider trading policy during 2019, and
none of them has hedged or pledged shares of our common stock.
Sustainability is one of our core values and has long been part of our approach to doing business, driving us to work
collaboratively across our entire value chain to address the environmental and social impacts of our products .  We aim to
continually improve the sustainability of our products and processes to create shared value for all of our stakeholders.
With strategic guidance and direction provided by Mitch Butier, our Chairman, President and CEO, responsibility over
ensuring that we continue to make meaningful progress towards achieving our 2025 sustainability goals currently resides
with Deon Stander, Vice President and General Manager of our Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS) business.
Our Sustainability Council, led by Mr. Stander and comprised of a cross-divisional and cross-functional group of leaders to
drive broad accountability and continually accelerate our progress, generally meets bimonthly and updates our executive
leadership team quarterly.  Board oversight over sustainability is primarily conducted by the Governance Committee, which
receives a report from management at least once a year.  In addition, our full Board hears from our leaders on each of our
businesses’ sustainability initiatives during its regular review of their business strategies.  In July 2019, our Board held
strategy sessions focused on our sustainability progress and our innovation efforts to address increasing demand for more
sustainable products.
We seek to ensure that our sustainability efforts are consistent with the expectations of our stakeholders shown on the
following page.  We regularly communicate with individuals and organizations interested in how we do business generally
and our sustainability efforts in particular, and also conduct stakeholder interviews as part of our regular sustainability
materiality assessments.  These assessments help set our sustainability agenda, focusing us on the areas in which we can
have the most impact.

Company
In the integrated report in which this proxy statement is included, we present the highlights of our achievements against
our 2025 sustainability goals.  In the first five years of the 10-year horizon for these goals, we have made meaningful
progress, which is summarized on our sustainability scorecard shown on page vii of the Proxy Summary.  You can find
additional information on the sustainability section of our website.
With Board oversight from the Governance Committee, our social responsibility efforts reflect our spirit of community
and help strengthen the places around the world in which we operate.  We make most of our community investments
through the Avery Dennison Foundation (the ‘‘Foundation’’), which annually invests at least 5% of its assets from the prior
year primarily to advance education, sustainability and women’s empowerment, and encourages employee engagement
with a spirit of invention and innovation. The Foundation invests in communities by making grants to community-based
organizations, promoting employee volunteerism and engagement, and awarding scholarships.

7The Foundation’s global grantmaking initiative is its primary means of giving.  Grantmaking is aided by our employees

are targeted to the communities in which our employees live and work.

As the hands and heart of our company, our employees are critical to advancing the Foundation’s efforts.  Because they
better understand of the needs of their communities, more than 150 employee teams coordinate volunteerism locally at our
global locations. In 2019, over 75% of the Foundation’s grants were enhanced with volunteer time from our
employees .
The Foundation also engages employees through its Granting Wishes program, which allows them to recommend
one-time grants to local NGOs.  Employees often have a connection to the organizations they nominate through
volunteerism or service on the organization’s board.  In the eight years since the Foundation launched Granting Wishes,
more than 2,000 of our employees have made recommendations, enabling grants to more than 360 organizations.
The Foundation provides scholarships to the children of our U.S. employees.  To date, over 650 scholarships have been
awarded to U.S. college students.
In China and India, the Foundation’s InvEnt Scholarships have for more than a decade supported the next generation of
innovators in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. By providing undergraduates in those communities with
tuition assistance, an invention competition and professional development opportunities, the Foundation seeks to inspire
the spirit of innovation in future engineers and technology workers.  As part of their application, students submit ideas for an
invention they then design during their scholarship year.  To date, nearly 200 scholarships have been awarded to Chinese
and Indian students who have demonstrated outstanding innovative spirit and strong practical competence.

2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation9In February 2020, our Lead Independent Director, David Pyott, notified our Board of his intention not to stand for
reelection at the Annual Meeting so that he may focus on other endeavors.  As a result, Mr. Pyott’s membership on our
Board will end on the date of the Annual Meeting.  Our Board actively reviews its composition and the need for refreshment,
and determined not to appoint an additional director at this time but may decide to do so in the future
In light of Mr. Pyott’s upcoming departure, in February 2020, the Governance Committee evaluated our Board
leadership structure and recommended to our Board that Patrick Siewert be selected to serve as Lead Independent
Director.  The committee’s decision took into account his significant contribution to the Board’s responsibility of maintaining
the integrity of our financial statements as a member of the Audit Committee for the past 15 years and its Chair for the past
four years, as well as his extensive international experience in Asia, a region in which nearly 35% of our sales are generated
and approximately 60% of our employees are located.  With Mr. Pyott’s departure, the Governance Committee determined
that Mr. Siewert is best positioned to provide independent leadership of our Board in overseeing our strategies to drive
long-term value creation for our key stakeholders of customers, employees, investors and communities.  Upon the
recommendation of the Governance Committee, the independent directors on our Board unanimously selected Mr. Siewert
(with him and Mr. Pyott abstaining) to serve as our Lead Independent Director, effective immediately after the Annual
Meeting subject to his reelection.  A description of responsibilities of our Lead Independent Director can be found on
page 11 of this proxy statement.
Our Board met five times and acted once by unanimous written consent during 2019.  There were 17 Committee
meetings during the year. All of our current directors attended at least 85% of the aggregate number of Board and
Committee meetings of which he or she was a member during 2019; the average attendance of these directors was
97%. Directors are strongly encouraged to attend our annual stockholder meetings under our Governance Guidelines and,
except for our then-retiring former Chairman, all of our directors attended the 2019 Annual Meeting .
Our Governance Guidelines provide the governance framework for our company and reflect the values of our Board, as
highlighted on the following page.  They are reviewed at least annually and amended from time to time to reflect changes in
regulatory requirements, evolving market practices, recommendations from our advisors and feedback from our
stockholders. Our Governance Guidelines were most recently amended in December 2019.

Director Qualifications
The Governance Committee reviews the skills and characteristics of our Board members and
recommends director nominees
Our Governance Guidelines require that our Board be comprised of a majority of directors who satisfy the criteria for
independence under NYSE listing standards.  These standards also require that our audit, compensation and nominating
committees be comprised entirely of independent directors.  An independent director is one who meets the independence
requirements of the NYSE and who our Board affirmatively determines has no material relationship with our company,
directly or indirectly as a partner, stockholder or officer of an entity with which we have a relationship.
Each year, our directors complete a questionnaire designed to solicit information that may have a bearing on the annual
independence determination, including all relevant relationships they have with our company, directly or indirectly through
our company’s sale or purchase of products or services to or from the companies or firms by which they are employed.  The
Governance Committee reviews any relevant disclosures made in the questionnaires with our General Counsel/Corporate
Secretary, as well as any transactions our company has with director-affiliated entities.  In February 2020, the Governance
Committee reviewed only one relationship impacting the independence of our directors, namely Mr. Butier’s service as our
President and CEO.

Our Governance Guidelines give our Board – acting through its independent directors – the discretion to separate or
combine the roles of Chairman and CEO as it deems appropriate based on the needs of our company at any given time. To
facilitate this decision-making, the Governance Committee annually reviews our Board leadership structure, providing its
recommendation on the appropriate structure for the following one-year term to our independent directors. Our
independent directors do not view any particular Board leadership structure as necessarily preferable; rather, they make an
annual determination taking into account, among other things, our financial position, business strategies and any feedback
received from our stockholders.
Our Lead Independent Director role provides an effective balance with our combined Chairman/CEO role, exercising
critical duties in the boardroom to ensure independent Board decision-making.  Our Governance Guidelines clearly
delineate these responsibilities, which are shown below.  Mr. Pyott served as our Lead Independent Director during 2019
and, subject to his reelection, Mr. Siewert will assume the role after the Annual Meeting.
Designee: Preside over executive sessions of independent directors  and meetings of our
David Pyott Board at which our non-independent Chairman/CEO is not present

Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement12In addition to these responsibilities, Mr. Pyott performed the following activities as Lead Independent Director in 2019:
• Regularly engaged with our Chairman/CEO to help guide management’s ongoing discussions with the Board
on our strategic direction, including the review of our business strategies, the mitigation of related risks and
the assessment of potential acquisitions;
• Consulted regularly with our other independent directors;
• Provided feedback to our Chairman/CEO based on his discussions with our other independent directors;
• Met with members of senior management other than our Chairman/CEO; and
• Led discussions with several of our investors during our fall stockholder engagement program.
Supplementing our Lead Independent Director in providing independent Board leadership are our Committee Chairs,
all of whom are independent.
Our Board currently has a Chairman/CEO and a Lead Independent Director.  The Governance Committee oversaw the
evaluation of the performance of our Chairman/CEO and Lead Independent Director during the Board evaluation process
conducted in the fourth quarter of 2019, noting that Messrs. Butier and Pyott received positive feedback from our
independent directors in their respective roles.  Based in part on these evaluations, we believe that our current Board
leadership structure has provided effective independent oversight of our company.  During our ongoing engagement with
our stockholders, few of them have expressed concerns with our Board leadership structure, which we believe reflects
support for our robust and clearly delineated Lead Independent Director role.
In February 2020, the Governance Committee evaluated our Board leadership structure and recommended to our
Board that Mr. Butier be elected to continue serving as Chairman, noting that he has successfully led our company for the
last four years and is best positioned to lead our Board in overseeing our strategies to drive long-term value creation for our
key stakeholders of customers, investors, employees and communities.  The committee further noted that Mr. Butier has
articulated and worked to realize a long-term vision for our company that has delivered top quartile TSR performance and
resonated strongly with our stockholders, and that we could best continue our progress towards achieving our 2021
financial targets and 2025 sustainability goals by continuing combined leadership in the boardroom at this time.  Upon the
recommendation of the Governance Committee, our Board unanimously elected Mr. Butier (with him and Mr. Pyott
abstaining) to serve as our Chairman, effective immediately after the Annual Meeting subject to his reelection.
In light of Mr. Pyott’s upcoming departure from our Board, the Governance Committee recommended that Mr. Siewert
(with him and Mr. Pyott abstaining) serve as Lead Independent Director.  Having an experienced director with financial
expertise and substantial international experience serve as Lead Independent Director will provide Mr. Butier valuable
mentorship, independent guidance and leadership as he enters his second year in the Chairman role.  With Mr. Pyott’s
departure, the Governance Committee determined that Mr. Siewert is best positioned to provide independent leadership
of our Board in overseeing our strategies to drive long-term value creation for our key stakeholders. The committee’s
decision took into account his significant contribution to the Board’s responsibility of maintaining the integrity of our
financial statements as a member of the Audit Committee for the past 15 years and its Chair for the past four years, as well as
his extensive international experience in Asia, a region in which nearly 35% of our sales are generated and approximately
60% of our employees are located.  Upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee, our independent directors
unanimously selected Mr. Siewert (with him and Mr. Pyott abstaining) to serve as our Lead Independent Director, effective
immediately after the Annual Meeting subject to his reelection.
Each of our Board committees has a written charter that describes its purposes, membership and meeting
structure, and responsibilities.  These charters, which may be found on our website at

2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation15Our Board believes it is important to have executive sessions without our Chairman/CEO or other members of
management present, which are generally held at regular Board meetings.  Our independent directors have robust and
candid discussions at these executive sessions during which they critically evaluate the performance of our company,
Chairman/CEO and management. As Lead Independent Director, Mr. Pyott presided over the three executive sessions
of independent directors held during 2019.
Executive sessions were also scheduled for regular meetings of the Audit, Compensation and Governance Committees
held.  These executive sessions generally excluded our former non-independent Chairman, our current Chairman/CEO and
other members of management, unless the Committee requested the then-serving Chairman and/or one or more members
of management to attend a portion of the session to provide information or perspective.
Management is responsible for managing the day-to-day risks confronting our businesses, but our Board has
responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk management (ERM).  The teams leading our businesses have incorporated ERM
into developing and executing their strategies, assessing the risks impacting their businesses, and identifying and
implementing appropriate mitigating actions on an ongoing basis.  In addition, in consultation with our head of risk
management and senior management, these teams semiannually prepare a risk profile consisting of a heat map and a
summary of their key risks and mitigating strategies, which are used to prepare a company risk profile based on identified
business-specific risks as well as enterprise-wide risks.
We also have robust global processes that support a strong internal control environment to promote the early
identification and continued management of risks by our company’s leadership.  Our legal and compliance functions report
into our General Counsel to provide independent evaluation of the challenges facing our businesses and our Vice President
of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee in the conduct of his operational responsibilities, ensuring his
independence from management.
In performing its oversight role, our Board is responsible for ensuring that the ERM processes designed and
implemented by management are functioning effectively, and that our culture promotes risk-adjusted
decision-making.
Our Board as a whole oversees risks related to our company and business strategies and operations, exercising this
responsibility by considering the risks related to its decisions. Each year, our Board receives reports on the ERM process
and the strategic plans and risks facing our businesses and company as a whole. These risks include financial risks,
geopolitical risks, legal and regulatory risks, supply chain risks, competitive risks, information technology risks, and
other risks related to the ways in which we do business.  Employees who lead various risk areas – such as information
technology; environmental, health and safety; tax; compliance; sustainability; and social responsibility – report periodically
to Board Committees and occasionally to our full Board.
Our Board has delegated elements of its risk oversight function to its Committees to better coordinate with
management to serve the long-term interests of all of our stakeholders.  Our Board receives reports from the Committee
Chairs regarding topics discussed at committee meetings, which include the areas of risk overseen primarily by the Board
Committees.

The Audit Committee oversees our internal control environment and evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls
at least annually.  Supplementing these processes, the Audit Committee periodically meets in executive session with each
of our CEO, CFO, CAO, General Counsel, Vice President of Internal Audit, and representatives of our independent
registered public accounting firm.  The Governance Committee meets semiannually with our Chief Compliance Officer to
discuss, among other things, the investigation of allegations reported to our Business Conduct GuideLine.
In 2019, the following risk areas were of particular Board and Committee focus:
The system and controls we put in place to ensure timely compliance with new lease accounting
guidance, as well as our control environment in new or expanded international operations;
Our tax planning and structuring transactions and strategies;
Our transfer of assets and liabilities primarily to an annuity insurance provider following the 2018
termination of our U.S. pension plan;
Cybersecurity and information technology operational risks, including our implementations of an
enterprise resource planning system in our Label and Graphic Materials North America business and a
significant software upgrade in our RBIS business;
Risks associated with our restructuring actions, capital investments in the U.S. and South Asia, R&D and
innovation, and acquisitions and equity investments; and
Risks related to environmental, social and governance matters, particularly in the areas of sustainability,
our Values and Ethics program, and corporate social responsibility, as well as human capital
management.

2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation17As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis  section of this proxy statement, we maintain best practices
in compensation that collectively encourage ongoing risk assessment and mitigation.  The Compensation Committee
periodically reviews our compensation programs to ensure that they do not provide incentives that encourage our
employees to take excessive risks in managing their respective businesses or functional areas.  The committee conducted
its most recent review in 2018.
Based on the advice of its independent compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, the Compensation Committee
noted the risk-mitigating features of our compensation policies and practices described below and on the following page,
which are substantially the same as what they were at the time of the committee’s most recent review.
Governance and Oversight
• The Compensation Committee has discretion to decrease Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) awards and long-term
incentive (LTI) grants based on individual performance, including as a result of excessive risk-taking.
• Our clawback policy serves as a deterrent to fraud or other misconduct that necessitates a restatement of our
financial statements (including, without limitation, any accounting restatement due to material
noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement).
• The Compensation Committee annually evaluates the performance of our CEO and other senior executives
in the context of our company and business goals and their individual contributions.
• Our stock ownership policy is rigorous and consistent with best practices, with a minimum ownership level of
6x and 3x base salary for our CEO and other NEOs, respectively, and a requirement that 50% of their
respective minimum ownership level be held in vested shares.
• We prohibit our officers from hedging or pledging company stock and require them to engage in stock
transactions only during limited trading windows.
Pay Philosophy and Structure
• Our programs prioritize incenting stockholder value creation, balanced by retention and other
considerations.
• The substantial majority of executive compensation is delivered in equity to motivate our company’s pursuit
of strong long-term performance and sustainable growth.
• Our change of control and executive severance plans are reasonable and consistent with market practices,
with change of control benefits provided on a double-trigger basis to mitigate the risk that such a transaction
be pursued to advance personal interests rather than the best interests of our stockholders.
• Our incentive compensation consists of short- and long-term performance objectives balanced with
objectives designed to incent strong annual financial performance and long-term economic and stockholder
value creation, as well as balancing growth and efficient capital deployment.
Incentive Program Design
• Our AIP and LTI awards incent annual profitable growth balanced with long-term financial value creation,
using multiple performance objectives to deliver realized compensation that is based on company and/or
business performance.
• AIP awards are not guaranteed, with below-threshold performance potentially resulting in zero payout,
payments subject to an overall cap of 200%, and individual modifiers for our NEOs generally capped at 100%.
17RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement18• Our equity awards are performance-based, use multiple performance objectives, are subject to threshold
and maximum payout opportunities, and have the following additional features that limit potential
risk-taking:
• Our performance units (PUs) cliff vest at the end of three years with the payout for the relative total
stockholder return (TSR) component capped at 100% of target for any three-year performance
period in which absolute TSR is negative to prevent executives from being unduly enriched when
stockholders experience loss, while still incenting them to deliver relatively strong performance
during challenging economic periods; and
• Our market-leveraged stock units (MSUs) vest over one-, two-, three- and four-year performance
periods (with an average performance period of 2.5 years), with challenging performance
objectives, including a threshold performance level of absolute TSR of (15)% and a target
performance level of absolute TSR of 10%.
Based on these and other factors, Willis Towers Watson determined that our compensation program strikes an
appropriate pay-risk balance.
Giving consideration to the advice of Willis Towers Watson, the Compensation Committee has concluded that
our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on our company.
The Compensation Committee and our full Board conduct executive succession planning semiannually, developing
and refining succession plans for our CEO and other senior executives. Consistent with this practice, in April 2019, our
Board discussed potential successors to our CEO . In addition, in October 2019, the Compensation Committee
reviewed talent that is ready – or, with continued development on their current trajectory with mentorship and
coaching from our current leaders, will be ready – to fill other senior executive positions in the event of a vacancy .
These assessments were then further discussed with our full Board. The Compensation Committee also regularly reviews
executive new hires, promotions, transfers and departures to assist with succession planning and leadership development.
Our Board is actively involved in overseeing our company’s HCM program to identify and develop our future leaders.
We maintain robust performance review and leadership development processes for our employees. Senior management
develops and reports to the Compensation Committee or our full Board on leadership at executive levels of our
organization by identifying high potential talent and critical experts, cultivating the skills and capabilities to allow
identified individuals to become our future leaders, and providing them with opportunities to further develop.
Through regular reports from management, our Board has the opportunity to meet our business leaders and functional
leaders in law, finance, information technology, compliance, and human resources.  In addition, Board members have
freedom of access to all our employees, and are encouraged to visit our facilities to meet local management and attend
company events.
Diversity is one of our core values, reflecting our efforts to create an inclusive and respectful environment for
people of all backgrounds and orientations and our recognition that we gain strength from diverse ideas and teams.
The importance of diversity and inclusion to our company is further evidenced by the inclusion of diversity-related targets in
our 2025 sustainability goals. Diversity and inclusion at our company are led by our cross-functional and cross-divisional
Diversity and Inclusion Council, co-chaired by Anne Hill, our Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, and
Deon Stander, the Vice President and General Manager of our RBIS business.  Board oversight is conducted primarily
through the Compensation Committee.
18HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (HCM)
SUCCESSION PLANNING
LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation29FEB202023153099
19In recent years, among other initiatives, our diversity and inclusion efforts have focused on training our managers
globally on unconscious bias , increasing the number of sites offering flexible work arrangements , and expanding our
Women Empowered program featuring interactive discussions among nominated participants to facilitate and enhance
their development.  We also evaluated our gender pay equity  and made adjustments to compensation where needed.
In 2019, we launched employee resource groups (ERGs) , which are voluntary employee-led groups made up of
individuals who join together based on common interests, backgrounds or demographic characteristics such as race,
ethnicity or sexual orientation.  Our ERGs currently include groups centered around women, ethnic Chinese, black
employees, military veterans, and LGBT+ individuals; participation in these groups is not limited to individuals in these
categories, but rather is open to all employees interested in learning about the experiences and challenges of their
colleagues.  In addition, we established regional diversity and inclusion councils  to provide leadership of initiatives that
more strongly resonate with employees in their respective regions.  We plan to launch global harassment prevention
training  in 2020 to supplement the anti-harassment messages we continually reinforce as part of our Values and Ethics
program.
Our initial director orientation generally covers (i) our strategies, performance and leadership; (ii) investor messaging;
(iii) the strategies and risks of our businesses; (iv) finance matters, including our financial reporting policies and practice s,
internal control environment, internal audit deployment, tax planning and compliance, and capital structure; (v) legal and
compliance matters, including our governance policies and procedures, Values and Ethics program, and ERM; (vi) executive
compensation and HCM matters, including succession planning, leadership development, and diversity and inclusion; and
(vii) information technology and cybersecurity.
Our continuing director education program consists of periodic visits to our facilities and management presentations
regarding our business operations, strategies, risks and values and ethics. We provide updates on these topics to our Board
at and between meetings throughout the year, and provide access to a boardroom news resource platform for them to keep
informed of emerging best practices. We also reimburse directors who attend continuing director education programs for
fees and related expenses.
The Governance Committee oversees and conducts an annual performance evaluation of our Board, Chairman, Lead
Independent Director and Board Committees, including the Committee Chairs. In 2019, our directors began evaluating
the individual performance of their peers serving on the Board, providing candid feedback and helping ensure
continuous boardroom improvement, as well as assisting with director succession planning. Our Board views the
evaluation process as integral to assessing its effectiveness and identifying improvement opportunities in the pursuit of
continued excellence. Many of the improvements in our governance practices and Board processes were identified and
implemented as a result of the annual evaluation process.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE EVALUATIONS
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement20In response to evaluation feedback received in recent years, our Board made the following enhancements to
its membership and processes:
• Enhanced our director succession planning process by focusing more deeply on Board leadership
roles , such as our Lead Independent Director and Committee Chairs, and identifying the need for
independent directors with packaging and technology expertise , culminating in the appointments
of Messrs. Lopez and Barrenechea to our Board;
• Enhanced the review of potential CEO successors and their progress against their development plans
and continued its focus on executive succession planning and leadership development  with more
frequent discussions with the Compensation Committee and our full Board;
• Given our strategic focus on acquisitions, enhanced discussion of our M&A pipeline and targets
actively under consideration, as well as the integration and performance of acquired companies;
• Continued our Board’s and the Audit Committee’s review and discussion of our cybersecurity
preparedness  and actions being taken to address our pension liabilities , including the 2018
termination of our U.S. pension plan and the transfer of those liabilities primarily to an annuity
insurance provider in 2019;
• Conducted annual post-investment reviews  of the return on significant capital expenditures,
acquisitions and information technology investments;
• Increased engagement with the Board on investor relations  matters and our stockholder
engagement  program and provided additional information on the competitive landscape  in each of
our businesses, in each case to further bring external perspectives into the boardroom; and
• Enhanced our Chairman/CEO’s engagement with the Board between meetings, with regular email
updates to the full Board and one-on-one meetings between him and each director.
We value stockholder feedback on our environmental, social and governance (ESG) and executive compensation and
HCM matters, and we actively solicit input through stockholder engagement to ensure that we reflect not only our evolving
business strategies but also the expectations of our investors.
We continued our longstanding practice of open dialogue with stockholders in 2019. In advance of the 2019 Annual
Meeting, we contacted our 35 largest institutional stockholders, representing approximately 61% of our then-outstanding
shares. Board members, including our Lead Independent Director, and management were made available to answer
questions and address concerns regarding the items being brought before the Annual Meeting. While we received
responses from stockholders representing over 30% of our then-outstanding shares, only one of them desired to
substantively engage at that busy time.  Respondents declining meetings indicated that they did not have any concerns
warranting discussion during proxy season.
In the fall, without the time pressures associated with proxy season, we contacted our 30 largest institutional
stockholders, representing over 62% of our then-outstanding shares, to request a meeting with our Lead Independent
Director and/or management. We received responses from stockholders representing nearly 60% of our then-outstanding
shares and spoke with stockholders representing approximately 35% of our then-outstanding shares. We substantively
engaged with every stockholder who requested to do so, and our Lead Independent Director led half of these
engagements . We also discussed the results of our fall engagement on ESG matters with the Governance Committee.
20STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ON ESG MATTERS IN 2019
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation21With respect to matters related to governance, we focused on our non-employee directors’ commitments as
they relate to overboarding concerns and discussed our Board composition and its succession planning and
refreshment processes, as well as the skills, commitments, tenure, and diversity of our directors.  We also
commented on our stockholder rights profile.  In addition, we discussed our Board’s oversight of our business
strategies and related risks; progress towards achieving our 2025 sustainability goals, including with respect to
plastic recyclability and how our businesses are adapting to the risks and opportunities presented by climate
change; and audit matters such as the tenure of our independent auditor.
Our Board welcomes feedback from all our stockholders.  We review correspondence submitted by stockholders,
discussing any substantive feedback received with senior management and/or our Board as appropriate.
Stockholders and other interested parties may contact our Board, Chairman, Lead Independent Director, any
Committee or Committee Chair, or any other individual director concerning business matters by writing to: Board of
Directors (or a particular subgroup or individual director), c/o Corporate Secretary, Avery Dennison Corporation, 207 Goode
Avenue, Glendale, California 91203.
21CONTACTING OUR BOARD
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement22Our Bylaws provide for a Board of between eight and 12 directors, with the exact number fixed by a resolution of our
Board.  Our Board has fixed the current number of directors at 11; in April 2020, our Board expects to fix the number of
directors at 10 to reflect David Pyott’s departure from the Board on the date of the Annual Meeting.  All nominees are
standing for election for a one-year term expiring at the 2021 Annual Meeting.
Each of the 10 nominees is presently serving on our Board and has consented to being named in this proxy statement
and serving if elected by our stockholders.
Our Bylaws provide for the approval by a majority of votes cast for the election of directors in uncontested elections like
this one and require that an incumbent director who is not re-elected tender his or her resignation from our Board.  Our
Board, excluding the tendering director, is required to determine whether to accept the resignation – taking into account
the recommendation of the Governance Committee and any other factors it considers appropriate – and publicly disclose
its decision regarding the tendered resignation, including its rationale for the decision, within 90 days from the date electio n
results are certified.  In contested elections, plurality voting is the standard for the election of directors.
In voting for the election of directors, each share has one vote for each position to be filled and there is no cumulative
voting.
Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR each of the 10 director nominees. The persons named as
proxies will vote for their election, unless you specify otherwise.  If any director nominee were to become unavailable prior
to the Annual Meeting, your proxy would be voted for a substitute nominee designated by our Board or we would decrease
the size of our Board.
Director nominees are generally recommended by the Governance Committee for nomination by our Board and
election by our stockholders.  Director nominees may also be recommended by the Governance Committee for
appointment to our Board, with their election by stockholders taking place at the next Annual Meeting.  Our Board believes
that our directors reflect a balance of skills, qualifications and backgrounds that allows them to effectively discharge their
oversight responsibilities as shown in the matrix included later in this section.
In evaluating whether to recommend a candidate as a director nominee, the Governance Committee primarily
uses the following criteria set forth in our Governance Guidelines:
•Independence , to ensure that a majority of our Board remains independent;
•Business and leadership experience , including industry experience  and global exposure  and
considering factors such as size, scope, and complexity;
•Board experience  at another public company;
•Experience in finance, accounting and/or executive compensation ;
•Time commitments , including other boards on which the nominee serves;
• Potential conflicts of interest ;
•Demographic characteristics  (such as gender, race and ethnicity);
• Ability to contribute to the oversight and governance of our company; and
• Ability to represent the balanced interests of stockholders as a whole, rather than those of any special
interest group.

RECOMMENDATION OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS
SELECTION OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation23For incumbent directors, the Governance Committee also considers their contributions to our Board and Committees,
attendance at Board and Committee meetings, compliance with our stock ownership policy, and mandatory retirement
dates to assist with director succession planning.  The Governance Committee does not assign specific weights to the
criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all nominees.
The Governance Committee reviews the qualifications of any candidate with those of our current directors in assessing
how our Board can most effectively fulfill its oversight responsibilities.  Sources for identifying potential nominees include
current Board members, senior management, executive search firms, and our stockholders.
Advance Notice Nominees
Stockholders may recommend director candidates by submitting the candidate’s name, together with his or her
biographical information, professional experience and written consent to nomination, to Governance and Social
Responsibility Committee Chair, c/o Corporate Secretary, Avery Dennison Corporation, 207 Goode Avenue, Glendale,
California 91203.  To be considered at the 2021 Annual Meeting, advance notice stockholder nominations must comply
with the requirements described in the penultimate section of this proxy statement.  The Governance Committee considers
stockholder nominees on the same basis as it considers all other nominees.
Proxy Access Nominees
A stockholder, or a group of no more than 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of our company’s stock continuously for
at least three years is permitted to submit director nominees (up to 20% of the Board) for inclusion in our proxy materials,
subject to the requirements specified in our Bylaws.  For further information on submitting proxy access nominees, please
refer to the penultimate section of this proxy statement .

Our Board’s ongoing director succession planning is designed to ensure an independent, well-qualified Board, with
diversity in skills, qualifications and backgrounds that aligns with our business strategies and enables effective oversight.
Our Governance Guidelines reflect our Board’s belief that directors should not be subject to term limits.  While term
limits could help facilitate fresh ideas and viewpoints being brought to the boardroom, our Board believes they could result
in the premature loss of a director who over a period of time has gained expertise in assessing our strategies, operations and
risks and is continuing to provide valuable contributions to Board deliberations. Further, we believe that our Board’s
decision not to establish term limits at this time is consistent with the prevailing practice among companies in the
S&P 500.
24MATRIX OF DIRECTOR SKILLS, QUALIFICATIONS AND BACKGROUNDS
BOARD REFRESHMENT AND DIRECTOR SUCCESSION PLANNING
NO TERM LIMITS
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation25Our Board recognizes that certain governance stakeholders have suggested that longer-serving directors may have
decreased independence and objectivity; however, our Board believes that arbitrarily removing knowledgeable directors
and losing the oversight consistency they bring – particularly during periods of either executive management change, such
as our recent CEO and CFO transitions, or Board change, such as Dean Scarborough’s April 2019 departure from our Board
after having served as Chairman for nine years and David Pyott’s upcoming departure from our Board in April 2020 after
having served as Lead Independent Director for 10 years – weighs against implementing term limits at this time.  Ultimately,
our Board believes that it is its responsibility to establish appropriate board refreshment policies, in light of our strategie s,
leadership team and financial position at any particular time, exercising its discretion in the best interest of our company an d
stockholders.  To assist in discharging this responsibility, the Governance Committee and/or full Board regularly reviews
the skills, qualifications and backgrounds of its members to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of our
businesses, align with our strategies and advance the interests of all of our stakeholders.
Our Board has adopted the policies described below to facilitate regular refreshment of our Board and ensure that it
continues to independently oversee, challenge and partner with our management team.

Upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee, Messrs. Barrenechea and Lopez were appointed to our
Board as independent directors in September 2018 and February 2017, respectively.  In connection with his becoming our
CEO, Mr. Butier joined our Board as a non-independent director in May 2016.  In addition, Mr. Scarborough departed from
our Board in April 2019 and Mr. Pyott will depart our Board in April 2020.  We believe that this recent experience with both
joining and departing directors demonstrates our Board’s commitment to regular refreshment.
The average age of our director nominees is 62, which we believe is comparable to the average board age in the
S&P 500 and within the 60-63 year band in which the plurality of these companies fall.  The average tenure of our
director nominees is approximately nine years, which we believe is comparable to the average tenure for companies in
the S&P 500 and within the 6-10 year band in which the majority of these companies fall.

Our Governance Guidelines reflect that the Governance Committee’s assessment of the qualifications of director
candidates includes consideration of demographic characteristics such as race, gender and ethnicity.  Although neither the
Governance Committee nor our full Board has a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity in selecting director
nominees, the committee seeks to recommend individuals with a broad diversity of experience, profession, skill,
geographic representation and demographic background, including characteristics such as race, gender and ethnicity.
While diversity is a consideration, nominees are not chosen or excluded solely or primarily on that basis; rather, the
Governance Committee focuses on skills, experience and background that can complement our existing Board in light of
the diverse and global nature of our businesses and operations.
Our Board recognizes the benefits of racial, ethnic and gender diversity in the boardroom, including better reflecting
our global customer base and the healthy debate that results from different viewpoints that may stem from diverse
backgrounds.  The racial, ethnic and gender diversity of our 2020 director nominees is shown in the chart below.

In addition to the information presented regarding each nominee’s experience and qualifications that led our Board to

global exposure, financial sophistication, and public company board experience – we believe that each of them has integrity
and adheres to our high ethical standards. Each nominee also has demonstrated the ability to exercise sound judgment,
fulfill the time commitments necessary to serve on our Board, and advance the long-term interests of all our
stakeholders.

31In recommending non-employee director compensation to our Board based on the independent expert
advice of Willis Towers Watson, the Compensation Committee seeks to target compensation at the median  of
companies similar in size, global scope and complexity with which we compete for director talent.  Compensation
is reviewed periodically (approximately every three years) to ensure market competitiveness and consistency.  The
majority of compensation is delivered in equity  to align director interests with those of our stockholders.
The components of our non-employee director compensation program are summarized in the charts below and
described thereafter.
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Equity Grant of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) $140,000
Cash Retainer $100,000
Match of Charitable/Educational Contributions $  10,000
Additional Cash Retainer for Lead Independent Director $   30,000
Additional Cash Retainer for Audit Committee Chair $   20,000
Additional Cash Retainer for Compensation Committee Chair $   15,000
Additional Cash Retainer for Governance Committee Chair $   15,000
TARGETED AT MEDIAN$250K
RSUsCash
Retainer 
Charitable Match
Our 2017 Incentive Award Plan, under which RSUs are granted to our non-employee directors, limits the sum of the
grant date fair value of equity awards and the amount of any cash compensation, in each case granted to any non-employee
director during any calendar year, to $600,000. In 2019, each of our non-employee directors received less than half of
our maximum compensation amount.
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee considered our non-employee director compensation program, which
had not changed the compensation received by our non-employee directors other than our Lead Independent Director
since May 2016.  At the Compensation Committee’s request, Willis Towers Watson reviewed trends in non-employee
director compensation and assessed the competitiveness of all components of our program, including cash compensation
(Board and Committee Chair retainers), equity grants, total direct compensation (annual cash plus equity), total
remuneration, our stock ownership policy and the additional retainer for our Lead Independent Director.
Using benchmarking data from public filings of companies ranked in the Fortune 375-500, Willis Towers Watson
recommended that our annual equity grant to non-employee directors be increased by $15,000 to increase the proportion
of their compensation delivered in equity to 60% to further align their interests with those of our stockholders.  This change
would bring total non-employee director compensation to $255,000, the projected median non-employee director
compensation of our Fortune 375-500 peers in 2021, the next time the Compensation Committee then expected to review
the program.  Based on Willis Towers Watson’s recommendation, the Compensation Committee recommended to our
Board that the amount of annual equity compensation granted to our non-employee directors be increased to $155,000,
with grants continuing to be in the form of RSUs that vest in one year.
After consideration of the advice from the independent compensation consultant, the recommendation of the
Compensation Committee, and further discussion, our Board approved the revised non-employee director compensation
program, effective as of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Our stock ownership policy requires non-employee directors to own $500,000 of our company stock, 50% of which
must be held in vested shares.  Stock option gains are not considered towards measuring policy compliance; only shares
owned directly or in a trust, deferred stock units (DSUs) and unvested RSUs count for these purposes.

COMPENSATION SETTING
STOCK OWNERSHIP POLICY
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement32Directors are prohibited from hedging or pledging our common stock.
Except for our newest director, who has five years to reach the minimum ownership level, all of our
non-employee directors have achieved the minimum ownership level required by our stock ownership policy;
average non-employee director ownership was approximately 9x the required level at year-end 2019.  Based
on our review of their written representations in our annual director questionnaire, none of our non-employee
directors has hedged or pledged our common stock.
The 2019 equity grant to non-employee directors was made in the form of RSUs that vest on the one-year anniversary of
the grant date, consistent with the one-year term to which directors are elected.  Unvested RSUs (i) fully vest upon a
director’s death, disability, retirement from our Board after reaching age 72 or termination of service within 24 months after a
change of control and (ii) are cancelled in the event a director voluntarily resigns, is not re-elected by stockholders or is
otherwise asked to leave our Board, unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise.  On May 1, 2019, each of
our then-serving non-employee directors was granted 1,414 RSUs with a grant date value of approximately $155,000 based
on the fair market value of our common stock on that date.
In connection with his departure from our Board on the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting and as permitted by our 2017
Incentive Award Plan, the Compensation Committee determined to accelerate the vesting of the RSUs granted in May 2018
to Dean Scarborough, our former Chairman.  These RSUs were scheduled to vest a few days after his departure from our
Board.  In accelerating the vesting, the Compensation Committee noted that Mr. Scarborough had served nearly the entire
one-year term for which he had been elected by our stockholders.
Cash retainers are paid semiannually and prorated for any director’s partial service during the year.  Directors are also
reimbursed for travel expenses incurred to attend Board meetings and continuing director education events.
Our non-employee directors may choose to receive this compensation in (i) cash, either paid directly or deferred into an
account under our Directors Variable Deferred Compensation Program (DVDCP), which accrues earnings at the rate of
return of certain bond and equity investment funds managed by a third party; (ii) DSUs credited to an individual account
pursuant to our Directors Deferred Equity Compensation Program (DDECP); or (iii) a combination of cash and DSUs.  None
of our non-employee directors currently participates in the DVDCP and nine of them currently participate in the DDECP .
When a director participating in the DDECP retires or otherwise ceases serving as a director, the dollar value of the DSUs in
his or her account is divided by the closing price of our common stock on the last date of the director’s service, with the
resulting number of shares of our common stock issued to the director.  Dividend equivalents, representing the value of
dividends per share paid on shares of our common stock calculated with reference to the number of DSUs held as of a
dividend record date, are reinvested on the applicable payable date in the form of additional DSUs credited to the accounts
of directors participating in the DDECP .
We match up to $10,000 per year of a non-employee director’s contributions to charitable organizations or educational
institutions.

(5)Mr. Scarborough retired from the Board on the date of our 2019 Annual Meeting.  Although he served as a non-employee director fo r four months of the year, he
received no cash fees during this time since the fees for the second half of a non-employee director’s term are paid in Decembe r of the previous year.  In addition, he
received no stock awards during the year, which are granted only to elected directors after the date of the Annual Meeting.  How ever, in connection with his departure
from our Board on the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting and as permitted by our 2017 Incentive Award Plan, the Compensation Commi ttee determined to accelerate
Mr. Scarborough’s RSUs granted in May 2018 that were scheduled to vest a few days after his departure from our Board.  In accele rating the vesting, the Compensation
Committee noted that he had served nearly the entire one-year term for which he had been elected by our stockholders.

Meeting, our Board determined to hold say-on-pay votes annually, at least until the next advisory vote on the frequency of
our say-on-pay vote (expected to occur at our 2023 Annual Meeting).
In this Item 2, our stockholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the Company’s stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of
the Company’s Named Executive Officers (NEOs), as described in the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis  and Executive Compensation Tables  sections of the Company’s 2020 proxy statement.
We are committed to maintaining ongoing engagement with our stockholders to seek their feedback and discuss why
we believe our executive compensation program properly aligns with our strategies by incenting our leaders to deliver
strong financial performance and create superior long-term, sustainable value for our customers, employees, investors and
communities. Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive
compensation. Properly dated and signed proxies will be so voted unless you specify otherwise.
The advisory vote is a vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs, as described in the Compensation Discussion
and Analysis  (CD&A) and Executive Compensation Tables  sections of this proxy statement.  It is not a vote on our general
compensation policies or any specific element of compensation, the compensation of our non-employee directors, our
CEO pay ratio, or the features of our compensation program designed to prevent excessive risk-taking as described in Risks
Associated with Compensation Policies and Practices .
The results of the advisory vote are not binding on our Board.  However, in accordance with SEC regulations, the
Compensation Committee will disclose the extent to which it takes into account the results of the vote in the CD&A of our
2021 proxy statement.

Over the last several years, we have successfully executed our business strategies, which are designed to create
long-term, sustainable value for our customers, employees and investors and improve the communities in which we
operate. From our stockholders’ perspective, we believe that value is best measured by our total stockholder return (TSR)
and cumulative economic value added (EVA), both of which are performance objectives used in our long-term incentive (LTI)
compensation program and inform how we set our goals for sales growth, operating margin improvement, asset efficiency,
return on total capital (ROTC) and capital allocation.
In March 2017, we announced long-term goals for our three reporting segments – Label and Graphic Materials (LGM),
Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS) and Industrial and Healthcare Materials (IHM) – and our company as a
whole, targeting continued solid organic sales growth, GAAP operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted earnings
per share (EPS) growth on a compound annual basis, and the ROTC we planned to achieve by 2021.

36COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS*
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
BUSINESS STRATEGY OVERVIEW
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation37To achieve these goals, we are focused on executing the following four core strategies:
•Achieving outsized growth in high value product categories  (organically and through acquisitions) to
improve our portfolio mix over time.  Product categories are defined as high value when they serve markets
that are growing faster than gross domestic product (GDP), represent large pools of potential profit and
leverage our core capabilities.  Examples include our specialty and durable label materials, graphic and
reflective solutions, industrial tapes, and radio-frequency identification (RFID) inlays and tags.  In 2019, we
delivered growth in most of these categories that was higher than the growth in our base businesses, while
also enhancing our RFID platform through our agreement to acquire the Transponder (RFID inlay) Division of
Smartrac (such division referred to herein as ‘‘Smartrac’’), which we announced last November;
•Growing profitably in our base businesses  by carefully balancing volume, price and mix; reducing
complexity; and tailoring our go-to-market strategies;
•Advancing sustainability  in our operations and throughout value chains; and
•Fostering well-being and diversity in our teams.
In addition, we continue to focus on the following financial priorities:
•Maintaining our relentless focus on productivity  to expand margins, enhance our competitiveness
(particularly in our base businesses) and provide a funding source for reinvestment.  Product reengineering
and enterprise lean sigma are the primary levers we use in executing this priority.
•Deploying capital effectively  and in a highly disciplined manner.  This is reflected in how we deploy capital
for organic growth, productivity, acquisitions and equity investments, as well as our approach to stockholder
distributions (dividends and share repurchases).
The five-year financial goals through 2021 that we announced in March 2017 included targets for organic sales growth,
GAAP operating margin, adjusted EPS growth and ROTC.  As shown below, based on our results of the first three years of
this five-year period, we are largely on track to deliver these commitments.
Organic sales change, adjusted EPS, ROTC and adjusted ROTC – as well as sales change excluding currency (sales
change ex. currency) and free cash flow, which are also discussed in this CD&A – are non-GAAP financial measures that we
provide investors to assist them in assessing our performance and operating trends.  These non-GAAP financial measures
are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for or superior to, the comparable financial measures under GAAP , are
defined, qualified and reconciled from GAAP in the last section of this proxy statement.
For the 2017-2019 period, on a three-year compound annual basis (with 2016 as the base period), GAAP reported
net sales and reported EPS increased by 5.1% and 0.3%, respectively, and GAAP reported net income decreased by
1.8%.

38In fiscal year 2019, we delivered another year of strong adjusted EPS growth and operating margin expansion.  We
achieved most of our financial goals for the year, with the accomplishments shown below.
NET SALES
$7.1BREPORTED EPS
$3.57
CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES
$746.5MNET INCOME
$303.6MReported sales declined by 1.2% due to the impact 
of foreign currency translation. On an organic basis, 
sales grew by 2.0% as growth in high value product 
categories more than offset a modest decline in our 
base businesses. Reported EPS decreased from prior year as a result
of net pension plan settlement charges, partially 
offset by benefits from tax structuring actions. 
Adjusted EPS increased by 9% due to higher 
volume and benefits from productivity initiatives to 
$6.60, which was above the midpoint of our $6.45 
to $6.70 guidance for the year. 
Removing the benefit of our negative tax rate in 
2019 due to the termination of our U.S. pension 
plan, achieved ROTC of 11.9%. Excluding the 
impact of pension plan settlements and tax benefit 
from a discrete foreign structuring transaction, 
adjusted ROTC was 19.6%.Free cash flow of $512.3 million was used, among
other things, to repurchase approximately 2.2 million
shares of our common stock for $237.7 million and
pay $189.7 million in dividends.
We have been consistently disciplined in executing our approach to capital allocation, balancing our investments in
organic growth, productivity and acquisitions, with continuing to return cash to stockholders through dividends and share
repurchases. In 2019, on net income of $303.6 million, we delivered adjusted ROTC of nearly 20% while investing
$257.2 million in capital expenditures to support future growth and further productivity improvement.  In addition,
we paid $189.7 million in dividends and repurchased $237.7 million in shares of our common stock.
We have invested in our businesses to support organic growth and pursued targeted acquisitions that support our
strategy of increasing our exposure to high value product categories.  Our spending on capital expenditures in 2019 was
comparable to prior year as we continued investing to enable the future growth of our businesses, improve our profitability
and expand our margins.  Last November, we announced our agreement to acquire Smartrac, a leader in the development
and manufacture of RFID products.  Together with our Intelligent Labels business, this acquisition will create a platform with
over $500 million in annual revenue, offering long-term growth and profitability, enhanced research and development
capabilities, expanded product lines and additional manufacturing capacity.  We completed this acquisition in February
2020.  During 2019, we also made equity investments in two start-up companies developing innovative technological
solutions.
In 2019, we deployed $427.4 million to (i) repurchase 2.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $237.7 million and
(ii) pay an annual dividend of $2.26 per share for an aggregate amount of $189.7 million.  Given the higher price of our
common stock in 2019, we allocated less capital to share repurchases in 2019 than in 2018; however, as shown in the graph
on the following page, the amount repurchased was comparable to the average amount repurchased over the prior two
years.  We have paid quarterly dividends for decades and most recently raised our quarterly dividend rate by

As shown below, we achieved total stockholder return (TSR) of over 48% in 2019, and delivered cumulative TSR for
the 2017-2019 three-year period and the 2015-2019 five-year period that substantially outperformed the S&P 500 /H23006
and the median of the S&P 500 Industrials and Materials subsets. We compare ourselves to the median of the S&P 500
Industrials and Materials subsets because we are a member of the Materials subset, and also share many characteristics with
members of the Industrials subset. This practice is further informed by feedback from investors, who have indicated that
they look at both subsets in evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers.  We focus on TSR because it measures
the return we provide to our stockholders, including stock price appreciation and dividends paid (assuming reinvestment of
dividends).
Although we experienced strong TSR in 2019, we continue to believe that our longer-term TSR is a more meaningful
measure of our performance than our one-year TSR, which can be significantly impacted by short-term market volatility that
may be unrelated to our underlying performance.  For example, although we delivered strong financial results in 2018 –
exceeding the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance for the year – our TSR for that year was negative, as was the TSR of
each of the comparator groups shown below.

40We continued our practice of maintaining proactive ongoing dialogue with stockholders in 2019.  The Committee
continually evolves our executive compensation program – including, in recent years, replacing regular grants of stock
options and time-vesting restricted stock units (RSUs) with performance-based market-leveraged stock units (MSUs),
capping Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) awards at 200% of target, and establishing additional guardrails on PU and MSU
performance criteria – to address feedback from our stockholders and more closely align our executive compensation
program with our financial profile and business strategies.  We believe this process and the specific actions taken
demonstrate the Committee’s commitment to paying for performance and being responsive to stockholder feedback. In
2019, during our ongoing stockholder engagement program, we discussed elements of our executive compensation
program with some of our stockholders, who generally expressed support for its structure.  We also solicited
stockholder opinions regarding potential changes in the Committee’s approach to CEO compensation for 2020 that are
discussed later in this CD&A, sharing that feedback with the Committee.
Results and Analysis of 2019 Vote
At the 2019 Annual Meeting, approximately 95% of our stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, our
executive compensation.  The level of support we received was consistent with the high approval rates we have received in
each of the last three years.  The Committee believes that our high approval rates in recent years, along with the positive
feedback we have received during our ongoing engagement with stockholders, reflects strong support of our
compensation program, as well as our consistently improving CD&A disclosure.
Stockholder Engagement Process
We continued our longstanding practice of ongoing engagement and open dialogue on executive compensation and
human capital management (HCM) matters with stockholders in 2019.  Our engagement program takes place throughout
the year, as shown in the graphic below.

management were made available to answer questions and address concerns regarding the items being brought before the
stockholder vote.  While we received responses from stockholders representing over 30% of our then-outstanding shares,
only one of them desired to substantively engage at that busy time.  Respondents declining meetings indicated that they
did not have any concerns warranting discussion during proxy season.

stockholders, representing over 62% of our then-outstanding shares, to request a meeting with our Lead Independent
Director and/or management.  We received responses from stockholders representing nearly 60% of our then-outstanding
shares and spoke with stockholders representing approximately 35% of our then-outstanding shares. We substantively
engaged with every stockholder who requested to do so, and our Lead Independent Director led half of these
engagements.  We also discussed the results of our fall engagement with the Committee.
Our off-season meetings focused on potential changes in the Committee’s approach to CEO compensation
for 2020 described later in this CD&A.  With respect to executive compensation, we also discussed the linkage
between our incentive compensation and business strategies.  We also reviewed our approach to HCM, including
our executive leadership development and succession planning processes, diversity and inclusion initiatives and
employee engagement scores.  We also reported on the Committee’s robust oversight of these priorities.
In this CD&A and the Executive Compensation Tables  section of this proxy statement, we provide compensation
information for our 2019 NEOs, identified in the chart below.  In connection with his planned retirement, Mr. Gravanis
ceased serving in the capacity shown below and as an executive officer of our company on December 31, 2019.

Our executive compensation program reflects the Committee’s philosophy that a substantial majority of compensation
should be tied to our success in meeting our performance objectives and creating stockholder value, providing higher
compensation when we deliver superior, sustained performance.  The objectives of this strategy are to motivate our
executives to achieve our annual and long-term financial goals and recognize their contributions to delivering strong
performance.
The Committee implements its pay-for-performance philosophy primarily through the following:
•Establishing target total direct compensation (TDC) to incent strong operational and financial
performance and stockholder value creation,  giving consideration to the market median of companies
similar in size, scope and complexity with which we compete for executive talent, role responsibilities,
individual performance, tenure, retention, and succession;
•Aligning our annual incentives for executives with our company’s annual operating plan  and key financial
and strategic goals; and
•Rewarding long-term performance using absolute and relative TSR, as well as cumulative EVA , to focus
our executives on delivering consistent and sustainable stockholder value creation.
Incentive compensation for the year consisted of target award opportunities under our AIP and our LTI compensation
program, with payouts determined based on our performance against goals established by the Committee in February
2019.  The Committee structures annual incentive compensation to reward NEOs based on corporate and/or business
performance to motivate them and align their compensation with stockholder interests, giving consideration to their
individual contributions in achieving our financial results. Our LTI awards provide higher realized compensation for
exceeding performance targets and downside risk (up to and including cancellation) for failing to achieve threshold
performance, with EVA targets consistent with our externally communicated long-term financial goals for earnings

Over the last few years, the Committee discussed how best to ensure that it is compensating our CEO optimally and in
alignment with the long-term interests of our stockholders.  The Committee’s objectives were to:
• Recognize our company’s performance and delivery of value to our customers, employees, investors and
communities during his four-year tenure as our CEO;
• Enhance his incentive to continue creating value for these stakeholders, including by driving superior TSR for
our investors; and
• Encourage his retention for the long term.
The Committee also sought to maintain market-competitive target TDC for him that is well-aligned with our company’s
performance and ensure that his target TDC does not fall substantially below the market median, without relying on the
traditional approach of periodic incremental increases to the components of his TDC – base salary, target AIP award
opportunity and target LTI award opportunity – to maintain consistency with a continually rising market median.
After extensive discussion, and giving consideration to the feedback received from dialogue with some of our
largest stockholders , the Committee determined to eliminate year-over-year increases to our CEO’s base salary and target
AIP and LTI opportunities in favor of an even longer-term approach that would hold his target TDC constant for a three-year
period.  During the three-year period, the Committee retains the discretion to review our CEO’s target TDC if market
conditions or company results warrant a change.  At the end of the period, the Committee plans to evaluate both his and
our company’s performance and market conditions before determining the appropriate level of his compensation,
continuing to give consideration to factors such as individual performance, tenure, retention and succession. This
approach to CEO compensation is intended to be more consistent with the long-term approach we take to planning
our strategies, setting our financial targets and sustainability goals, creating value for our stockholders, developing an
engaged and diverse workforce, and investing in the communities in which we operate.
43CHANGES IN APPROACH TO CEO COMPENSATION FOR 2020
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement44To ensure our CEO’s compensation determined in 2020 remains competitive and mitigate the potential for his target
TDC to substantially trail behind his peers in the next three years, the Committee determined to set his target TDC modestly
above market median, recognizing that his base salary had not increased for two years and his target AIP opportunity had
not increased since he became CEO in 2016.  The Committee intends to make no additional increases until 2023.
Anticipating that the median for market will continue to grow at historical rates, the Committee determined to set our CEO’s
compensation package roughly halfway between the current 50th and 75th percentiles of his market peers, with the
expectation that – at the end of the three-year period during which Mr. Butier’s compensation is expected not to increase –
his TDC would be at or around the market median. This approach is consistent with the approach taken by the Committee
with respect to recommending to our Board the compensation of our non-employee directors.
Based on 2019 market pay rates and projected 2020 market pay rates for companies with a market capitalization
between $6 billion and $10 billion, and with the expert advice and recommendation of its independent compensation
consultant, Willis Towers Watson, the Committee determined to set Mr. Butier’s target TDC for 2020 at $9.9 million by
increasing (i) his base salary by 6% to $1.2 million, noting that his base salary had not been increased in the previous two
years; (ii) his target AIP opportunity from 125% of base salary, the same level it was when he became CEO in 2016, to 140%
of base salary; and (iii) his target LTI opportunity from 475% of base salary to 585% of base salary. The Committee noted
that over 90% of this increase consists of at-risk, performance based compensation. These targets are not expected to
increase during the next three years, but could decrease if warranted by market conditions or company results.  Mr. Butier’s
realized compensation will be dependent on our company achieving strong TSR performance, delivering our 2021 financial
targets and 2025 sustainability goals, and continuing to serve our customers, engage our employees, and invest in the
communities in which we operate.

ensure that it serves the long-term interests of our stockholders.

financial objectives.  In 2019, approximately 86% and 72% of the TDC of our CEO and average of our other NEOs,
respectively, was performance-based.
In determining 2019 NEO compensation, the Committee considered the following:
•Company/Business Performance  – Our company’s financial performance, including our 2019 adjusted sales
growth, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow for our corporate NEOs, and, for our business NEOs, primarily the
performance of their respective business;
•Stockholder Returns  – Our TSR on an absolute basis, as well as relative to an objectively determined group
of peer companies;
•Annual Individual Performance  – Our CEO’s performance against the predetermined and objectively
measurable strategic objectives established for him at the beginning of the year and the individual
contributions of our other NEOs;
•Competitiveness  – Market pay practices and company performance relative to peers; and
•Investor Feedback  – The results of our 2019 say-on-pay vote and feedback on our executive compensation
received during our ongoing stockholder engagement program.
The key elements of 2019 NEO target TDC are described in the table shown on the following pages. While we provide
consistent, market-competitive target TDC opportunities for our NEOs, the actual compensation they realize varies
year-to-year based primarily on company and business performance; for 2019, the incentive compensation realized by
our NEOs was based solely on company and/or business performance.
In determining Mr. Butier’s target TDC for 2019, the Committee focused on his LTI compensation, having
increased his target LTI opportunity from 425% to 475% of base salary in February 2018.  The Committee had not
increased his base salary in either of the past two years or his target AIP opportunity since he became CEO in 2016.
This approach reflects the Committee’s pay-for-performance philosophy by prioritizing performance-based equity
to further incent our CEO to deliver top quartile long-term stockholder value creation.

2019 TDC TARGETED AT MEDIAN
In addition to the primary elements of our executive compensation program described above, we also provide our
NEOs with limited perquisites and benefits that the Committee believes are comparable to those offered by other
multinational public companies.
The Committee aims to have base salaries at or around the market median, with the substantial majority of NEO
compensation consisting of incentive compensation to advance the Committee’s pay-for-performance philosophy, driving
higher realized compensation when our financial performance is stronger and lower realized compensation when our
financial performance is weaker.
Increases in base salary are generally based on the average percentage merit increase given to our U.S. employees,
subject to increase based on the NEO’s performance and the market median for positions with similar scope and
responsibility.  The Committee approved limited salary increases, for our NEOs of approximately 3%, effective April 1, 2019,
consistent with the average increase for our U.S. employees, except for Mr. Butier, whose base salary was not increased.
NEO base salaries at year-end 2019 were as follows: Mr. Butier – $1,133,000; Mr. Lovins – $618,000; Ms. Miller –
$581,048; Mr. Stander – $555,129; and Mr. Gravanis – $626,282.  Amount for Mr. Gravanis was converted from euros using
the average exchange rate for the 12 months of 2019.
The 2019 AIP was designed to incent management to create long-term stockholder value.  NEOs are not eligible for
guaranteed AIP awards.  AIP awards are determined for each fiscal year using the formula below.  In contrast to the general
AIP formula shown, individual modifiers for NEOs are generally capped at 100%  (although the Committee retains the
discretion to determine higher individual modifiers, up to 150%).

49Target AIP Opportunities
As a percentage of 2019 year-end base salary, the target AIP opportunities for 2019 were 125% for Mr. Butier; 75% for
Messrs. Gravanis and Lovins; and 60% for Ms. Miller and Mr. Stander.  The only change to NEO target AIP opportunities in
2019 was an increase in Mr. Stander’s target AIP opportunity from 50% to 60% of base salary to better reflect the market
median for his role.
AIP Performance Objectives and Weightings; Target-Setting Principles
The following performance objectives and weightings for the 2019 AIP were established and weighted by the
Committee, in consultation with Willis Towers Watson. Our CEO, Chief Human Resources Officer and CFO participated
during portions of the meetings during which the Committee reviewed and recommended performance objectives for our
AIP and analyzed our performance against these objectives.
For our business NEOs (Messrs. Gravanis and Stander), the Committee determined to link 75% of the AIP financial
modifier to their respective business’ results and 25% to corporate results.  Business performance objectives were designed
to be achievable only if the respective business improved upon its 2018 performance and delivered results consistent with
the achievement of its 2021 financial targets.

In setting the targets for these objectives, the Committee aimed to ensure consistency with our 2021 financial targets
and require adjusted EPS improvement over the prior year; adjusted EPS is the measure on which we provide annual
guidance to our investors and a primary driver of stockholder value creation.  These were the same objectives and
weightings used for the 2018 AIP to continue incenting our NEOs to increase sales on an organic basis, improve profitability
and generate strong free cash flow.
Target adjusted sales growth of 4.4% was set consistent with our 2017-2021 target of at least 4% but lower than what we
achieved in 2018, reflecting our expectations for lower volume growth due to challenging market conditions.  Target
adjusted EPS was established above the midpoint of the annual guidance we provided to investors in January 2019 and
represented a 9% increase from our 2018 results for this measure.  Although we did not externally communicate a free cash

internally and by our investors in evaluating the amount of cash we have available for debt reductions, dividends, share
repurchases, and acquisitions.  Our 2019 target for free cash flow was 5% higher than the free cash flow we generated in
2018, despite continued planned above-average investment in fixed capital, information technology and cash restructuring

Financial Modifiers
Financial modifiers are capped at 200%.  Consistent with prior years, in evaluating our achievement of these
performance objectives, the Committee had the discretion to exclude the impact, positive or negative, of extraordinary
items such as acquisitions and divestitures; restructuring and integration actions not included in our annual net income plan;
currency translation fluctuations; changes in accounting principles, tax codes or related regulations and rulings;
extraordinary events such as natural disasters, terrorism and war; costs related to the early extinguishment of debt and
pension plan terminations; costs of litigation outside the normal course of business; and non-cash charges associated with
the impairment of long-lived assets.
The table on the following page shows the 2019 AIP financial modifiers for our NEOs.  As shown, the target level was
exceeded for two of the three performance objectives established for our corporate NEOs; exceeded for two of the four
performance objectives established for our LGM business NEO; and exceeded for all four of the performance objectives
established for our RBIS business NEO.  Our corporate and business performance resulted in AIP financial modifiers of 91%
for our corporate NEOs, 76% for our LGM business NEO and 114% for our RBIS business NEO.

(1)Total Company Adjusted Sales Growth refers to reported sales decline of (1.2)%, adjusted for the impact of currency translation  of 3.3%.  Total does not sum due to
rounding.
(2)Total Company Adjusted EPS refers to reported net income per common share, assuming dilution, of $3.57, adjusted for restructur ing charges and other items, pension
plan settlements, and tax benefit from discrete foreign tax structuring and planning transactions of $3.03.  Using its permitted  discretion under the AIP , the Committee
also excluded the $.02 impact of transaction costs related to our acquisition of Smartrac, which were incurred prior to our ent ry into an agreement to purchase the
company in November 2019, to not disadvantage AIP participants from pursuing acquisitions.
(3)Total Company Free Cash Flow refers to cash flow from operations of $746.5 million, minus purchases of property, plant and equi pment of $219.4 million and software
and other deferred charges of $37.8 million, plus proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment of $7.8 million, plus pr oceeds from insurance and sales
(purchases) of investments, net, of $4.9 million, plus pension plan contribution for plan termination of $10.3 million. Using it s permitted discretion under the AIP , the
committee also excluded $1.9 million of transaction costs related to our acquisition of Smartrac, which were incurred prior to o ur entry into an agreement to purchase
the company in November 2019, to not disadvantage AIP participants from pursuing acquisitions. Free cash flow is measured quarte rly to ensure consistent
management of working capital throughout the year, subject to adjustment if the full-year target is not achieved.  While total c ompany free cash flow was 114% of
target, the measurement of this objective on a quarterly basis, as required by the Committee to incent consistent delivery of f ree cash flow throughout the year, resulted
in a modifier of 145% for that objective.
(4)Adjusted sales growth, adjusted net income and free cash flow measures at the segment level are internal metrics.  These metrics  either exclude or make simplifying
assumptions for items that cannot be allocated precisely by segment, such as interest and income tax expenses, and related bala nce sheet accounts, such as deferred
tax assets and liabilities, income tax payables and receivables, and short- and long-term debt.  Certain balance sheet accounts such as pension and other
postretirement benefits and insurance that are generally managed at the corporate level, as well as the impact of foreign curre ncy translation, are also excluded from
the calculation of these metrics for the segments.  In certain limited circumstances, one-time items may be excluded from segmen t adjusted net income.  The impact of
intercompany sales is included in segment metrics.  While LGM’s free cash flow was 110% of target, the measurement of this objec tive on a quarterly basis, as required
by the Committee to incent consistent delivery of free cash flow throughout the year, resulted in a modifier of 122% for that o bjective. Using its permitted discretion
under the AIP , the Committee adjusted RBIS’ free cash flow payout to exclude the impact of approximately $18 million of higher-t han-planned capital spend associated
with accelerating growth in of our Intelligent Labels platform.
(5)Adjusted net income refers to income before taxes, tax-effected at the adjusted tax rate, and adjusted for tax-effected restruc turing charges and other items.  Adjusted
tax rate is the full-year GAAP tax rate, adjusted to exclude certain unusual or infrequent events that are expected to signific antly impact the GAAP tax rate, such as
impacts related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan and the effects of discrete tax planning actions.

Our NEOs are evaluated on their individual performance for the year, with the Committee approving our CEO’s goals
for the year and our CEO approving the goals of our other NEOs.  The performance of our NEOs is assessed in February of
the following year.  For our NEOs other than the CEO, this assessment considers the totality of their performance rather
than assigning weightings to their performance goals.  Individual modifiers for all participants are capped at 150%, subject
to the total cap on AIP awards of 200%.
Although it retains the discretion to determine higher individual modifiers (up to 150%), the Committee has
determined that the individual modifiers for our CEO and other NEOs should generally be capped at 100%. All of
the NEO individual modifiers for 2019 were capped at 100%, as they were for the three prior years.
The Committee reviewed and evaluated our CEO’s 2019 performance, taking into account his performance against the
predetermined and objectively measurable strategic objectives established in February of that year, his self-assessment of
his performance, and market reference and other data provided by Willis Towers Watson.  Our CEO is not involved in the
decisions regarding his compensation, which are determined by the Committee meeting in executive session with Willis
Towers Watson.  The Committee determined the individual modifier for our CEO based on its assessment of his
performance, within the context of the caps described above.

PREDETERMINED AND MEASURABLE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES54In determining the individual modifiers for our other NEOs and recognizing that the general cap of 100% eliminated the
potential upside from the individual modifier on their AIP awards, the Committee noted the following highlights of the 2019
performance of our other NEOs:
•Mr. Lovins – Led our finance function, delivering results that met our 2019 goal for adjusted EPS despite a
challenging market environment, with free cash flow significantly above our target; executing our capital
allocation strategies to enable future organic growth, the acquisition of Smartrac and the return of cash to
stockholders through dividends and share repurchases; and serving as interim leader of our IHM segment,
achieving top-line growth with significant margin expansion in that business for the year.
•Ms. Miller – Led our legal function, developing a new operational model aligned with our company’s core
strategies that will accelerate productivity, standardize processes and deploy best practices across the
function; supporting our capital allocation strategies, including our acquisition of Smartrac and footprint
optimization efforts; and overseeing our values and ethics and compliance program.
•Mr. Stander – Led our RBIS business, delivering strong performance in 2019 that exceeded all of its key
financial and performance metrics; continuing to accelerate growth and capability in its high value product
categories of RFID and external embellishments; and elevating productivity, service, speed and quality with
an engaged and diverse global team.
•Mr. Gravanis – Led our LGM business, delivering operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow in a
challenging top-line environment; building its portfolio of more sustainable products while advancing its
progress in reducing waste and greenhouse gas emissions; and completing a multi-year recapitalization plan
in Europe, including a substantial expansion of LGM’s Luxembourg manufacturing facility.
Based on the above assessments and after giving consideration to the recommendations of our CEO (other than with
respect to himself), the Committee approved individual modifiers of 100% for all NEOs.

2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation55Annual LTI awards were granted on February 28, 2019, the day our Board held its regularly-scheduled meeting.
The Committee does not offset the loss or gain of prior year grants in determining current year grants, as
doing so would compromise the intended risk/reward nature of these incentives.
Actual amounts, if any, realized by our NEOs from the vesting of these awards will be based on our performance, as well
as our stock price, at the time of vesting.
Although we have suspended the regular grant of stock options and time-vesting RSUs to our executives, special
awards may be granted by the Committee for hiring, promotion, retention or other incentive purposes, with the awards
granted on the first day of the last month of the calendar quarter following the event or decision to make such a grant.  No
such awards were granted to our NEOs in 2019.
Target LTI Opportunity
As a percentage of base salary, the target LTI opportunities for our NEOs were 475% for Mr. Butier; 250% for Mr. Lovins;
and 180% for Ms. Miller and Messrs. Gravanis and Stander. Target LTI award opportunities represented approximately
79% and 75%, respectively, of our CEO’s and other NEOs’ average performance-based incentive compensation. The
only changes to NEO target LTI opportunities for 2019 were increases in (i) Mr. Lovins’ target LTI opportunity from 200% to
250% of base salary and (ii) Mr. Stander’s target LTI opportunity from 140% to 180% of base salary, in each case to better

established for the award.  PUs do not accrue dividend equivalents and are not counted towards measuring compliance
with our stock ownership policy.
The Committee established the following performance objectives for the 2019-2021 PUs.  The Committee believes that
these objectives continue to appropriately align executive compensation with the long-term interests of our stockholders
because delivering cumulative EVA and strong TSR relative to peer companies reflects the value we create for our investors.
•Cumulative EVA, weighted 50% for our corporate NEOs (based on our total company EVA) and 75% for
our business NEOs (based on their respective business’ cumulative EVA) .  EVA is a measure of financial
performance calculated by deducting the economic cost associated with the use of capital (weighted
average cost of capital multiplied by average invested capital) from our after-tax operating profit.  The
Committee established cumulative EVA targets for our corporate NEOs consistent with our 2017-2021
targets for earnings growth and ROTC and our primary objective of delivering superior TSR, with the target
payout at the midpoint of these targets and the maximum payout at the high end of these targets.
Cumulative EVA targets for our business NEOs focused on their respective business’ EVA change compared
to the prior three-year period, with the target payout at the midpoint of their respective business’ 2017-2021
targets and the cost of capital fixed over the performance period. In contrast to the AIP , cash restructuring
charges – which include severance and related costs and exclude asset impairment charges and lease and
other contract cancellation costs – are included in EVA calculations as the Committee expects that these
investments will generate a return over the three-year performance period (in contrast to the AIP , which has a
one-year performance period).  Whether linked to corporate or business results, the 2019-2021 cumulative
EVA targets require continue improvement in financial performance.
55 Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement56•Relative TSR compared to an objectively determined peer group of companies, weighted 50% for our
corporate NEOs and 25% for our business NEOs .  TSR measures the return that we provide to our
stockholders, including stock price appreciation and dividends paid (assuming reinvestment of dividends).
Consistent with its pay-for-performance philosophy, the Committee designed the TSR objective to provide
realized compensation only if our stockholder value creation compares favorably relative to the designated
peer group.  The Committee set the threshold payout level at TSR at the 40th percentile, the target payout
level at TSR at the 50th percentile, and the maximum payout level at TSR at the 80th percentile, which were the
same levels used for the 2018-2020 PUs. Reflecting previously received stockholder feedback, payouts
for the relative TSR component of PUs are capped at 100% of target if our absolute TSR is negative for
the 2019-2021 performance period .  In assessing the rigor of the TSR objectives, the Committee noted that
our stock price and TSR had significantly decreased in the prior year; as a result, performing at the median
relative to our peers over the 2019-2021 performance period would represent solid performance, particularly
in light of our relatively high exposure to the impact of foreign currency translation and geopolitical and
trade-related uncertainty.
Consistent with the 2018-2020 PUs and upon the recommendation of Willis Towers Watson, to benchmark
TSR, the Committee continued utilizing a peer group‡ comprised of U.S. companies (i) in similar industries
based on their classification in one of five GICS groups (diversified chemicals, specialty chemicals, metal and
glass containers, paper packaging, and paper products) and (ii) with revenues during the last twelve months
of $1 billion to $20 billion.  Based on the formulaic application of the same objective criteria, the peer group
changed from the prior year as follows: (A) Ingevity Corporation; Neenah, Inc.; Rayonier Advanced
Materials Inc.; and Schweitzer-Mauduit International Inc. were added because each of their last twelve
months’ revenues had exceeded $1 billion; (B) A. Schulman, Inc. and KapStone Paper and Packaging
Corporation were deleted because they had been acquired; and (C) Venator Materials PLC was deleted
because it was no longer based in the U.S.

Market-leveraged Stock Units (MSUs)
MSUs are LTI awards that:
• Are fully performance-based because they are tied to our absolute TSR performance, which represents
appreciation in our stock price and dividends paid; and
• Have one-, two-, three- and four-year performance periods, with an average performance period of 2.5 years.
The Committee selected an equity vehicle that vests ratably over years because MSUs replaced stock options and
RSUs, both of which had vested ratably over four years. MSUs were designed to achieve the combined objectives of our
previously granted equity vehicles, including retention (similar to RSUs) and the provision of higher realized
compensation from stock price appreciation (similar to stock options, but more limited due to fewer shares earned for
target performance and a cap on the number of shares that can be earned above target), while making our LTI
compensation program fully performance-based .  The Committee continues to believe that retention is an important
objective of our executive compensation program.

shares paid out at vesting based solely on our absolute TSR and the value realized reflecting both the number of shares paid
out as well as our stock price at the time of vesting.  Although dividend equivalents accrue on MSUs during the performance
period, they are earned and paid out only at vesting; as such, if the threshold level of performance were not achieved, any
dividend equivalents accrued during the performance period would be cancelled.
The performance criteria for MSUs, which reflect previously received stockholder feedback seeking to make the criteria
more challenging, are shown in the chart on the right on the following page.  Every 1% increase in TSR above 10% increases
the payout by 1.54%.  The Committee determined to maintain the same MSU performance objectives for 2019 given that
the more challenging MSU structure is achieving the Committee’s goal of incenting strong long-term performance and
value creation.

Annual LTI Awards
Our NEOs were granted the annual LTI awards shown in the table below in February 2019. The number of awards
granted was based on the respective NEO’s (i) base salary at year-end 2018 and (ii) target LTI opportunity, with the number
of PUs granted based on a grant date fair value equal to the average closing price for shares of our common stock during the
first ten trading days of February 2019 and the number of MSUs based on a grant date fair value using the Monte-Carlo
simulation method described in footnote (2) of the 2019 Summary Compensation Table .  As a result of the methodology
used to determine grant date fair value, awarded LTI values were slightly lower than target LTI values.

58on LGM’s cumulative three-year EVA and 25% on our three-year relative TSR; and (iii) for our RBIS business NEO, 100% on
RBIS’ cumulative three-year EVA.  The key goal-setting principle in setting cumulative EVA targets was consistency with our
2017-2021 financial goals for growth and ROTC, which the Committee believes translates into delivering above-average
TSR.
The cumulative EVA target of $692 million for our corporate NEOs was consistent with our 2017-2021 targets for
organic sales growth and operating margin expansion and recognized that increasing sales and operating margin, together
with balance sheet efficiency, are key drivers of EVA improvement. The cumulative EVA target established in February
2017 for our corporate NEOs was approximately 55% higher than the cumulative EVA we achieved for the three-year
period ending in 2016 .  EVA required for maximum payout – cumulative EVA of $774 million – was consistent with the high
end of our long-term growth and operating margin targets.  As shown below, we delivered cumulative EVA of $890 million
for the 2017-2019 performance period, resulting in a payout of 200% for the EVA component for our corporate NEOs.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Benefits
Our U.S. NEOs are eligible to participate in our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which allows eligible U.S.
employees to defer up to 75% of their base salary and up to 90% of their AIP award.  Although we previously allowed
deferral of LTI awards, we ended this plan feature in 2015.  The plan provides those NEOs and other eligible employees in
the U.S. with a long-term capital accumulation opportunity because deferred amounts accumulate on a pre-tax basis.
Participating executives may select from a number of investment options .  Our only deferred compensation plan currently
open for deferrals does not offer above-market interest rates. Deferrals are 100% vested.

GENERAL BENEFITS
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement60We made an annual contribution as of January 1, 2019 to the deferred compensation accounts of our U.S. NEOs for
401(k) eligible earnings and deferred compensation in 2018 in excess of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the ‘‘Code’’) compensation limit.  This annual contribution provided an automatic contribution of 3% of pay and a matching
contribution of up to 50% of the first 7% of pay above the Code compensation limit.  This benefit is designed to supplement
401(k) contributions that are limited under the Code.
For additional information regarding our deferred compensation plan and accrued NEO benefits thereunder, see 2019
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation  in Executive Compensation Tables .
Retirement Benefits
Our U.S. NEOs had been eligible for retirement benefits under our now terminated U.S. pension plan and may be
eligible for retirement benefits under our benefit restoration plan, a nonqualified excess benefit plan, in each case subject t o
the same terms and conditions as our other eligible U.S. employees.  Because the accrual of benefits under these plans was
frozen as of December 31, 2010, none of our eligible NEOs accrued additional retirement benefits during 2019. In addition,
we terminated our U.S. pension plan as of September 28, 2018.  For additional information regarding these plans and
accrued NEO benefits thereunder, see 2019 Pension Benefits  in Executive Compensation Tables .  Mr. Gravanis had legally
mandated retirement benefits in his previous work location of France and his work location at the time he ceased serving as
an employee in the Netherlands.
Defined Contribution Benefits
Our U.S. NEOs are eligible to participate in our employee savings plan, a qualified 401(k) plan that permits U.S.
employees to defer up to 100% of their eligible earnings less payroll deductions to the plan on a pre-tax basis and 25% of
their eligible earnings on an after-tax basis, subject to the annual limit prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for
the aggregate of company contributions and employee pre- and post-tax contributions.  Employee deferrals are
immediately vested upon contribution.  In 2019, we contributed up to 6.5% of an employee’s eligible compensation, 3% of
which was an automatic contribution and up to 3.5% of which was a matching contribution of 50% of the employee’s
contributions up to 7% of pay, subject to the Code compensation limit.  Participants vest in company contributions to their
savings plan account after two years of service.
Employees are immediately eligible to participate in the savings plan, and all our NEOs participated in the plan during
fiscal year 2019, except for Mr. Gravanis who was not a U.S. employee and therefore was ineligible.  Our U.S. NEOs
participate in the plan subject to the same eligibility and benefit terms and conditions as our other U.S. employees.
Life Insurance Benefits
In addition to the $50,000 in life insurance benefits we provide to all U.S. employees, our U.S. NEOs are provided with
supplemental life insurance benefits equal to three times the NEO’s base salary less $50,000, up to a maximum coverage
amount of $1 million.
Executive Long-Term Disability Insurance Benefits
If our U.S. NEOs elect to enroll in executive long-term disability coverage, their long-term disability benefit is equal to
65% of their eligible pre-disability monthly earnings up to a maximum of $25,000 per month.  Coverage is available only for
the executive; dependents are not covered.
Personal Excess Liability Insurance Benefits
We provide $3 million of personal excess liability insurance coverage to our U.S. NEOs.  Personal excess liability
coverage provides an additional layer of liability coverage that supplements the coverage provided by the individual’s
personal liability insurance.  To receive any benefit from this excess liability insurance, the NEO must maintain certain
minimum coverage requirements under his or her personal liability policy.
60 2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation61None of our NEOs has an employment contract, and each is employed at-will, which reflects our pay-for-performance
philosophy; if an NEO is no longer performing at the expected level, he or she can be terminated immediately without
receiving a contractually-guaranteed payment.  However, the Committee believes that providing our executives with
severance benefits helps ensure that they act in the best interests of our company and stockholders, even if doing so may be
contrary to their personal interests, such as where it could lead to the termination of their employment or a change of
control of our company.  The Committee believes these benefits are consistent with market practices.
The compensation of our NEOs in the event of termination not for cause are governed by our Amended and Restated
Executive Severance Plan (the ‘‘Severance Plan’’) and our Amended and Restated Key Employee Change of Control
Severance Plan (the ‘‘COC Severance Plan’’).  We use these plans rather than individually negotiated agreements to provide
us with the flexibility to change the severance benefits for which our NEOs are eligible to reflect market practices without
the need to obtain their individual consent.  In addition, this plan-based approach eliminates the time and expense it would
require to individually negotiate separation payments and ensures that our NEOs are eligible for benefits on the same terms
and conditions as employees with similar levels of responsibility.  Receipt of benefits under these plans is conditioned on the
executive signing a waiver and general release of claims against our company, as well as agreeing to non-competition,
non-solicitation, and non-disclosure covenants in favor of our company.  Any violation of these covenants could result in our
company seeking to recover some or all severance benefits previously paid or pursuing any other claims that may be
appropriate under the circumstances.
Unvested equity awards outstanding on the date of termination are generally cancelled, except for employees who
qualify as retirement eligible under the terms of our equity incentive plans, whose awards are accelerated upon termination
of service.  Mr. Gravanis and Ms. Miller qualified as retirement eligible as of the end of fiscal year 2019.  As a result, their
outstanding PUs and MSUs would vest at the end of the performance period on a prorated basis based on our actual
performance.
For additional information regarding potential NEO benefits under these plans, including the treatment of equity
awards under various termination scenarios, see Payments Upon Termination as of December 28, 2019  in Executive
Compensation Tables .
Severance Following Involuntary Termination Not for Cause
Our NEOs are eligible to receive severance benefits upon involuntary termination not for ‘‘cause,’’ in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Severance Plan.  In the event of a qualifying termination, our CEO currently would be
eligible to receive two times the sum of his annual salary, his highest AIP award received for the preceding three years and
the cash value of 12 months of his qualified medical and dental insurance premiums; our other NEOs currently would be
eligible to receive one times his or her respective sum of these amounts.  All NEOs currently would also be eligible to
receive up to $25,000 in outplacement services for up to one year following termination of employment.  Any payments
made under the Severance Plan would be offset by any payments received by the NEO under any statutory, legislative and
regulatory requirement or, if applicable, the COC Severance Plan.
In February 2020, the Committee amended and restated the Severance Plan, effective July 1, 2020, to provide
that the AIP award portion of the Severance Plan payment be changed from the highest AIP award received for the
preceding three years to the target AIP award for the year of termination.
Severance Following Change of Control
Our NEOs are eligible for severance payments upon termination not for ‘‘cause’’ or by the executive for ‘‘good reason’’
within 24 months of a ‘‘change of control’’ of our company, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the COC
Severance Plan.   In the event of a qualifying termination following a change of control, our CEO currently would be eligible
to receive three times the sum of his annual salary, his highest AIP award received for the preceding three years, and the cash
value of 12 months of his qualified medical and dental insurance premiums; our other NEOs currently would be eligible to
receive two times his or her respective sum of these amounts.  Our NEOs would also be eligible to receive a pro rata AIP
award for the year of termination and up to $25,000 in outplacement services for up to one year following termination of
employment.  Any payments under the COC Severance Plan would be offset by any payments received by the NEO under
the Severance Plan and any other statutory, legislative and regulatory requirement.
61SEVERANCE BENEFITS
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement62In February 2020, the Committee amended and restated the COC Severance Plan, effective July 1, 2020, to
provide that the AIP award portion of the COC Severance Plan be changed from the highest AIP award received for
the preceding three years to the target AIP award for the year of termination.
Under our equity incentive plans, unvested equity awards granted to our NEOs would generally vest only if the NEO is
terminated without ‘‘cause’’ or resigns for ‘‘good reason’’ within 24 months after the change of control.  Outstanding PUs
and MSUs granted beginning in 2018 vest based on actual performance, if determinable, and otherwise based on target
performance.
Our NEOs are not eligible to receive any excise tax gross-up on amounts payable under the COC Severance Plan.  If an
NEO would otherwise incur excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code, payments under the COC Severance Plan will be
reduced so that no excise taxes would be due if the reduction results in a greater after-tax benefit to the NEO.
The Committee annually considers market survey data to target TDC, looking at market capitalization peer companies
to reflect the broad talent market across which we seek our executives.  The Committee reviews results from a third party
survey to understand market compensation practices and assess our competitiveness, narrowing the scope of the results to
account for variations caused by company size.
In February 2019, the Committee was presented with industry-wide data from the most recent Willis Towers Watson
U.S. Compensation General Industry Database, which was narrowed in scope to focus on data of the 52 participants with
$6 billion to $10 billion in annual revenue.  The Committee reviewed the data with executive matches based on job and
functional responsibility on an aggregated basis, with no consideration of the survey’s respective component companies,
which were not determined or known by the Committee.
The Committee uses the survey data as a reference point to target TDC and the components thereof at the market
median, giving consideration to responsibilities, individual performance, tenure, retention and succession.
For determining our relative TSR for purposes of vesting 2017-2019 PUs and granted 2019-2021 PUs, the Committee
used a peer group comprised of U.S. companies satisfying objective criteria for industry classification and revenue size, the
names of which are disclosed in this CD&A.  The Committee does not utilize a peer group for any other purpose.
The Committee annually reviews tally sheets that reflect the components of each NEO’s compensation.  The tally sheets
reviewed in February 2020 included the following information for each of the most recent up to three fiscal years in which
the individual was an NEO:
• Compensation history, including annual cash compensation (base salary and AIP awards), LTI awards, value of
vested LTI awards, and annualized cost of benefits and perquisites;
• The expected value of annual compensation for the year, including base salary, AIP award and the grant date
fair value of LTI awards;
• Accumulated value of compensation, including total accumulated value of LTI awards and accumulated
benefit values under our retirement and deferred compensation plans;
• Potential payments under various termination scenarios; and
• Compliance with our stock ownership policy.

2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation63The Committee believes that reviewing tally sheets is useful in determining executive compensation because they
provide a historical perspective on NEO compensation and include information that will be contained in our proxy
statement.
Our Board believes that hiring and retaining effective executives and providing them with market-competitive
compensation are essential to the success of our company and advance the interests of our stockholders.  The Committee,
which is comprised solely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing our executive compensation program.
The Committee may delegate authority to subcommittees or, in certain limited circumstances not related to the
compensation of our executive officers, to our CEO.
Under its charter, the Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion and at our expense, to obtain advice and
assistance from external advisors.  The Committee may retain and terminate any compensation consultant or other external
advisor and has sole authority to approve the advisor’s fees and other terms and conditions of the retention.  In retaining its
advisors, the Committee must consider each advisor’s independence from management, as required by NYSE listing
standards.
During 2019, the Committee retained Willis Towers Watson as its independent compensation consultant and the firm
performed the following services for the Committee:
Assisted with setting the target TDC for our CEO, both for 2019 and potential changes in approach going forward
Evaluated proxy advisory firms’ pay-for-performance analyses
Commented on our 2019 CD&A
Provided incentive compensation advice (including analyzing the performance of our AIP payouts, evaluating global long-term
incentives, and recommending the relative TSR peer group for the PUs granted in 2019)
Provided guidance on the impact of the TCJA on executive compensation
Reviewed the appropriateness of our executive perquisites
Conducted analyses of the share utilization and stockholder value transfer related to our LTI compensation
Reported on U.S. investor areas of focus related to executive compensation and HCM matters
Assessed and recommended changes to our non-employee director compensation program
Prepared for, attended and reviewed documentation for Committee meetings
In 2019, Willis Towers Watson received $255,355 in compensation from our company for professional services
performed for or at the request of the Committee.  We also reimbursed the firm for its reasonable expenses.
The Committee conducted its annual assessment of Willis Towers Watson’s performance in December 2019, which
included a review of the services provided during the year, the fees paid therefor and the following additional evaluation
criteria:
•Experience  – The firm’s depth and breadth of executive compensation knowledge and experience;
qualification as a board-level consultant; quality of staff, data, and other resources; and understanding of our
business strategy and challenges, industry, performance drivers and HCM considerations;
•Independence  – The firm’s objectivity in giving advice and making recommendations, and its willingness to
provide candid feedback regarding management and Committee proposals, questions and concerns;
•Preparation  – The quality and timeliness of the firm’s reports (in accuracy, type and amount of information,
clear communication and responsiveness to issues); its review and feedback on management proposals, and
the firm’s preparation with the Committee Chair and our management, as appropriate; and
•Committee Relationship  – The accessibility and availability of members of the engagement team; the firm’s
reporting relationship with the Committee Chair and its working relationship with our human resources team;
and the effectiveness of its communication.
63INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT AND EXPERTISE
WILLIS TOWERS WATSON 2019 SERVICES
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement64Based on this assessment, the Committee determined that it was satisfied with the performance of Willis Towers
Watson and the individual members of the engagement team serving the Committee.
Willis Towers Watson and the Committee have had the following protocols in place since the engagement commenced
to ensure the firm’s independence from management: the Committee has the sole authority to select, retain and
terminate Willis Towers Watson, as well as authorize the firm’s fees and determine the other terms and conditions that
govern the engagement ; the Committee directs Willis Towers Watson on the process for delivery and communication of its
work product, including its analyses, findings, conclusions and recommendations; in the performance and evaluation of its
duties, Willis Towers Watson is accountable, and reports directly, to the Committee ; and the Committee may consult
with Willis Towers Watson at any time, with or without members of management present, at the Committee’s sole discretion.
As required by SEC regulations and NYSE listing standards, the Committee considered the independence of its
advisors in December 2019.  The Committee reviewed information provided by Willis Towers Watson, members of the
Committee and our executive officers related to the following factors:
•Other services provided to our company  – During fiscal year 2019, Willis Towers Watson performed no
services for our company other than executive compensation services performed at the request of the
Committee;
•Fees paid by our company as a percentage of the firm’s total revenue  – Fees from our company reflected
approximately 0.001% of Willis Towers Watson’s revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2019;
•Policies and procedures maintained to prevent or mitigate conflicts of interest  – Willis Towers Watson has
several policies and procedures to ensure its advice is objective and independent, including a comprehensive
code of conduct and ethics and quality policies that mandate rigorous work reviews and periodic compliance
reviews, which the firm has represented to the Committee are highly effective;
•Business or personal relationships with members of the Committee  – Based on disclosures from Willis Towers
Watson and members of the Committee, we are aware of no such business or personal relationships;
•Company stock owned by Willis Towers Watson firm representatives  – No members of the Willis Towers
Watson team serving the Committee own any stock in our company, other than potentially through
investments in mutual or other funds managed without the member’s input; and
•Business or personal relationships with any executive officer of our company  – Based on disclosures from the
firm and our executive officers, we are aware of no business or personal relationships with Willis Towers
Watson or the members of the engagement team advising the Committee.
The Committee affirmatively determined Willis Towers Watson to be independent and both the firm and the
members of the engagement team advising the Committee to be free of any conflicts of interest.
In the event of fraud or other intentional misconduct on the part of an NEO that necessitates a restatement of our
financial results (including, without limitation, any accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial
reporting requirement), the NEO would be required to reimburse our company for any AIP or LTI awards paid or granted in
excess of the amount that would have been paid or granted based on the restated financial results.  These remedies would
be in addition to, not instead of, any other actions taken by our company (through the imposition of any discipline up to and
including termination), law enforcement agencies, regulators or other authorities.  This clawback policy has been
contractually acknowledged by our NEOs upon the execution of their LTI award agreements since 2010.
The Committee first approved our clawback policy in 2009 to subject incentive compensation to forfeiture if our
financial results are not achieved consistent with our high ethical standards.  This policy is expressly incorporated into our
AIP and LTI plans.  The Committee anticipates that it will revise the policy if and as necessary to comply with final rules issu ed
by the SEC.
64ADVISOR INDEPENDENCE
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
CLAWBACK POLICY
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation65The Committee aims to compensate our NEOs in a manner that is tax effective for our company.  However, the
Committee may adopt or implement compensation programs and/or practices that are not fully tax deductible to the extent
it believes doing so is in the best interests of our company and stockholders.
Section 162(m) of the Code
Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, Section 162(m) of the Code (‘‘Section 162(m)’’) generally limited our federal income
tax deductions for executive compensation in any fiscal year to the extent total compensation for certain executive officers
exceeded $1 million in such year, unless it qualified as ‘‘performance-based.’’ For taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2017, the TCJA amended Section 162(m) by, among other things, expanding the scope of executive officers
covered by Section 162(m) and eliminating the exception for ‘‘performance-based’’ compensation.  As a result,
compensation in excess of $1 million paid to covered executive officers generally will not be deductible, unless it qualifies
for limited transition relief under the TCJA.  To qualify for transition relief, compensation must, among other things, be
payable pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and not subsequently modified in
any material respect.
While in the past we have structured certain of our incentive compensation in a manner intended to be tax-deductible
for purposes of Section 162(m), due to the TCJA and the uncertainties in the application of Section 162(m) as amended by
the TCJA, there is no guarantee that deductions claimed under Section 162(m) will not be challenged or disallowed by the
IRS and our ability to deduct compensation under Section 162(m) may be restricted.  Furthermore, although the Committee
believes that the deductibility of executive compensation is an important consideration and may continue to consider the
effects of the TCJA on our future pay practices, it reserves the right to approve and pay executive compensation
arrangements that are not fully tax deductible, and/or modify compensation programs and practices without regard to tax
deductibility, if it believes that doing so is in the best interests of our company and stockholders.
Section 409A of the Code
Nonqualified deferred compensation must be deferred and paid under plans or arrangements that satisfy the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code with respect to the timing of deferral elections and payments and certain other
matters.  Failure to satisfy these requirements could expose individuals to accelerated income tax liabilities, penalty taxes
and interest on their compensation deferred under these plans. As a general matter, we design and administer our
compensation and benefit plans and arrangements in a manner intended to cause these plans and arrangements to be
either exempt from, or satisfy the requirements of, Section 409A of the Code.
65TAX IMPLICATIONS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement66The table below shows the compensation earned by or awarded to our NEOs during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 in
accordance with SEC regulations.  Compensation as shown in the table does not reflect the compensation actually realized
by our NEOs for these years.  For example, the amounts set forth under ‘‘Stock Awards’’ do not represent amounts realized
by our NEOs; rather, they represent the aggregate grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes of PUs (which are
subject to the achievement of cumulative EVA and relative TSR performance objectives measured at the end of a three-year
period and may result in no such compensation ultimately being realized by our NEOs) and MSUs (which are subject to
forfeiture in the event our absolute TSR declines more than 15% over one-, two-, three- or four-year performance periods).

(1)Amounts include any portions of salary contributed to our employee savings plan or deferred under our deferred compensation pla n.  Changes in base salary
approved by the Compensation Committee for 2019 became effective on April 1 of that year.  Mr. Butier’s salary was not increased in 2019 for the reasons described in
the Compensation Discussion and Analysis  section of this proxy statement.
(2)Amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of PUs and MSUs granted in 2019 and do not reflect compensation actually re alized by our NEOs in that year.  For
values actually realized by our NEOs from the vesting of PUs and MSUs during the year, see the ‘‘Value Realized on Vesting’’ co lumn of the 2019 Option Exercises and
Stock Vested  table.
Amounts in 2019 include the grant date fair value of PUs, which are paid out in shares of our common stock at the end of a thre e-year period provided that the
designated performance objectives are achieved at the end of the period.  The number of shares paid out at vesting can range fro m 0% to 200% of the target shares at
the time of grant.  The performance objectives that determine the number of shares that may be earned for the PUs granted in 201 9 were (i) cumulative EVA (weighted
50% based on our total company for our corporate NEOs and 75% based on their respective business for our business NEOs), which is a performance condition under
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation  (ASC 718), and (ii) company relative TSR (weighted 50% for our corporate NEOs
and 25% for our business NEOs), compared to the TSR of a peer group of companies objectively determined based on GICS code and revenue size, which is a market
condition under ASC 718, in each case computed over the three-year (2019-2021) performance period.  The performance condition co mponent of the fair value of PUs
was determined based on the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date.  The maximum grant date fair values of the performance condition component
of PUs were $2,643,588, $736,764, $714,753, and $832,758 for Messrs. Butier, Lovins, Stander, and Gravanis, respectively, and $ 498,717 for Ms. Miller.  The market
condition component of the fair value of PUs was determined as of the date of grant using the Monte-Carlo simulation method, wh ich utilizes multiple input variables to
estimate the probability of meeting the performance objectives established for the award, including the expected volatility of our stock price relative to the group of
peer companies listed on page 56 of this proxy statement at the end of the three-year performance period and a risk-free intere st rate of 2.48% derived from linear
interpolation of the term structure of Treasury Constant Maturities yield rates for the performance period; as such, their maxi mum grant date fair values were the same
as their target grant date fair values included in the table.  Based on the Monte-Carlo simulation method, the grant date fair v alue of the market condition component
of the PUs was 111.98% of our closing stock price on the grant date.  The grant date fair values of the market condition compone nt of the PUs were $1,345,419,
$375,038, $121,222, and $141,305 for Messrs. Butier, Lovins, Stander, and Gravanis, respectively, and $253,816 for Ms. Miller.
Amounts in 2019 also include the grant date fair value of MSUs, which are paid out in shares of our common stock over one-, two -, three- and four-year performance
periods provided that the designated performance objectives are achieved as of the end of each period.  The number of shares pai d out at vesting can range from 0%
to 200% of the target shares on the grant date.  The single performance objective that determines the number of units that may b e paid out for MSUs is our absolute
TSR, which is a market condition under ASC 718; as such, their maximum grant date fair values were the same as their target gra nt date fair values shown in the table.
The grant date fair value of MSUs of $135.85 in 2019 for all NEOs, which was 125.74% of our closing stock price on the grant da te, was determined using the Monte-
Carlo simulation method, which utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability of meeting the performance objecti ves established for the award, including
the expected volatility of our stock price over one-, two-, three- and four-year performance periods and risk-free interest rat es of 2.55%, 2.52%, 2.48% and 2.48% for
the first, second, third and fourth MSU tranches, respectively, derived from linear interpolation of the term structure of Trea sury Constant Maturities yield rates for the
performance periods.
(3)Amounts reflect cash AIP awards for the applicable year, which are determined in February and paid in March of the following ye ar.
(4)Mr. Gravanis was not eligible to participate in these plans.

(1)Amounts represent threshold, target and maximum opportunities under the 2019 AIP .  Target awards were established by multiplying  each NEO’s base salary at the end
of 2019 by the following target AIP opportunities: 125% for Mr. Butier; 75% for Messrs. Lovins and Gravanis; and 60% for Ms. Mi ller and Mr. Stander.  Payout levels
range from 50% if the target amounts for threshold performance are achieved with respect to each of the performance objectives to 200% if the amounts for maximum
performance are achieved with respect to each of the performance objectives.
(2)Amounts for MSUs represent threshold, target and maximum opportunities, which are paid out in shares of our common stock over o ne-, two-, three- and four-year
performance periods provided that the absolute TSR performance objective is achieved as of the end of each period.  The actual n umber of shares paid out can range
from 0% to 200% of the target number of shares on the grant date, with a threshold payout opportunity of 85%.  MSUs accrue divid end equivalents during the
performance period, which are earned and paid out only at vesting.
Amounts for PUs represent threshold, target and maximum opportunities for the 2019-2021 PUs, which are paid out in shares of ou r common stock at the end of a
three-year performance period provided that the cumulative EVA and relative TSR performance objectives, are achieved at the end  of the period.  The actual number of
shares paid out can range from 0% to 200% of the target number of shares on the grant date, with a threshold payout opportunity  of 50% if threshold performance is
achieved with respect to each of the performance objectives.
(3)The grant date fair value of MSUs was determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation method, which utilizes multiple input variabl es, including expected volatility of our
stock price and other assumptions appropriate for determining fair value, to estimate the probability of satisfying the perform ance objective established for the award.
The grant date fair value for the performance condition component of PUs was determined based on the fair market value of our c ommon stock on the grant date.  The
grant date fair value for the market condition component of PUs was determined as of the grant date using the Monte-Carlo simul ation method described above.
For information on the inputs to the Monte-Carlo simulation method, see footnote (2) of the 2019 Summary Compensation Table. For additional information regarding
the assumptions we use for our stock-based compensation, see Note 12, ‘‘Long-Term Incentive Compensation,’’ to the consolidated  financial statements contained in
our 2019 Annual Report.

Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement70The present values of accumulated pension benefits shown in the table below have been calculated based on the
assumptions we used to calculate our pension benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements contained in our
2019 Annual Report.  Since the accrual of additional benefits under these plans has been frozen since December 31, 2010,
the change in present values from year to year is based primarily the assumptions we use to determine the present value of
participants’ accumulated benefits for purposes of our year-end audited financial statements and secondarily on the
passage of time.  Messrs. Gravanis and Stander have not been included in the table because they have no accrued benefits
under these plans.
Amounts shown for Pension Plan (i) for Mr. Butier and Ms. Miller reflect the lump-sum value of the pension benefit
accrued as of March 21, 2019, the date on which these benefit obligations were transferred to an annuity insurance provider,
and (ii) for Mr. Lovins reflect the lump-sum value received as a result of his election to receive a lump-sum payment in
connection with the plan’s termination.  Amounts shown for Benefit Restoration Plan for all NEOS reflect the lump-sum value
of the pension benefit accrued as of December 28, 2019, the last day of our fiscal year.

(1)While the Benefit Restoration Plan allows for lump-sum payment, the Pension Plan required that distributions take the form of a  monthly annuity,
except in special circumstances.  For information regarding the assumptions we use to determine the present value of accumulated  benefits for
our pension plans, see Note 6, ‘‘Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,’’ to the consolidated financial statements containe d in our 2019
Annual Report.
(2)Amounts for the Pension Plan reflect the lump-sum value of the pension benefit accrued as of March 21, 2019, the date on which these benefit
obligations were transferred to an annuity insurance provider.
(3)Amount reflects the lump-sum value received as a result of Mr. Lovins’ election to receive a lump-sum payment in connection wit h the Pension
Plan termination.
We previously provided qualified retirement benefits for eligible U.S. employees under the Avery Dennison Pension
Plan (the ‘‘Pension Plan’’).  All of our NEOs – except for Messrs. Gravanis and Stander – were eligible to receive benefits
under the Pension Plan, including reduced benefits in the event of early retirement.  The accrual of additional benefits under
the Pension Plan was frozen as of December 31, 2010.
In September 2018, we terminated the Pension Plan. In connection with the termination, we contributed $200 million to
the plan in August 2018.  During the fourth quarter of 2018, we settled approximately $152 million of our Pension Plan
liabilities through lump-sum payments from existing plan assets to eligible participants who elected to receive them. In
March 2019, we settled the liabilities for approximately 8,300 active and former employees and their beneficiaries of
approximately $750 million primarily through the purchase of a group annuity contract from American General Life
Insurance Company (‘‘AGL’’), a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc.  AGL assumed the future annuity payments
for these individuals, commencing at April 1, 2019.
Compensation covered by the Pension Plan included base salary and AIP awards, up to the applicable statutory
limitations each plan year.  Employees vested in the Pension Plan after five years of service, or at age 55 upon termination of
employment.

PENSION PLAN
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation71Benefits under the Pension Plan were based on pensionable earnings, length of service, when benefits commence, and
how they are paid.  Benefits were calculated separately for each year of applicable service using a formula equal to 1.25%
times compensation up to the breakpoint (which for each year prior to our freezing the accrual of additional benefits was the
average of the Social Security wage bases for the preceding 35 years) plus 1.75% times compensation in excess of the
breakpoint.  The results of the calculation for each year of service were added together to determine the annual single life
annuity benefit under the Pension Plan for an employee at normal retirement (generally age 65), which was not subject to
reduction for Social Security payments.
Eligible participants could have elected to receive their benefits in one of several payment forms payable in monthly
installments.  Benefits were generally paid in annuity form over the lifetime of the participant and/or a beneficiary.  By
default, single participants were eligible for a single life annuity, and they could have chosen from alternate payment forms
that included benefits payable to a beneficiary.  By default, married participants were eligible for a joint and survivor annuit y
that was payable over the participant’s lifetime, and, if survived by a spouse, over the spouse’s lifetime.  Married participant s
could choose alternate payment forms, with the consent of the spouse.  The monthly benefit each eligible participant could
receive was adjusted based on the plan’s definition of actuarial equivalence.
Benefits were generally payable without reduction after participants reach age 65; however, certain participants –
including our participating NEOs – could have been eligible to receive an unreduced benefit at age 62.  Prior to age 62, a
participant’s benefits were reduced by 15% for commencement of benefits at age 61 and an additional 5% for each
additional year the participant elected to receive benefits early, provided that no benefit could commence before a
participant reached age 55.
Our Benefit Restoration Plan (BRP) is a nonqualified excess benefit plan that provides for the payment of supplemental
retirement benefits to eligible participants in an amount equal to the amount by which their benefits otherwise payable
under the Pension Plan would be reduced under the Code.  All NEOs – except for Messrs. Gravanis and Stander – are
eligible to receive benefits under the BRP .  The accrual of additional benefits under the BRP was frozen as of December 31,
2010; as a result, no additional accruals were made during 2019.
Because the BRP is designed to mirror the Pension Plan, the information concerning the compensation covered, benefit
formula, early retirement provisions, and payment forms is the same as that of the Pension Plan except that (i) the BRP
provides for payment in the form of a lump-sum distribution, unless a timely election is made for monthly payments over the
lifetime of the participant and a designated beneficiary, and (ii) BRP benefits are generally payable upon the later of
separation from service and age 55.
The table below provides information regarding NEO and company contributions to nonqualified deferred
compensation plans(1) in fiscal year 2019.  Mr. Gravanis has not been included in the table because, as a non-U.S. employee,
he was not eligible to participate.

(1)Amounts reflect the NEOs’ participation in the Executive Variable Deferred Retirement Plan (EVDRP).  Under the EVDRP , participan ts may choose among publicly

Our Executive Variable Deferred Retirement Plan (EVDRP) is the only active deferred compensation plan available to
our eligible U.S. employees.  Earnings are based on a fixed rate and/or the performance of variable bond and equity funds
selected by the participant from available options .  The EVDRP does not offer investment options that provide above-
market interest rates.
Eligible employees are able to defer U.S. taxes until their investment is withdrawn, providing an opportunity for them to
accumulate savings on a pre-tax basis.  We also benefit from this arrangement because we do not have to expend cash to
pay amounts individuals have elected to defer.  As a result, we can use this cash for other corporate purposes until a
deferred compensation account is paid to a participant at the time the participant elected to receive in-service withdrawals
or after termination of employment.
All deferred compensation accounts are unfunded obligations of our company and subject to the same risks as any of
our general debts and obligations.  As a result, these accounts help mitigate risk-seeking behavior by management that
could be detrimental to the long-term health of our company.
Employee Contributions
Under the EVDRP , eligible employees can defer up to 75% of their salary and 90% of their AIP award.
Company Contribution
As of January 1, 2019, we made a contribution to the deferred compensation accounts of eligible employees based on
401(k) eligible earnings in excess of the Code compensation limit and deferred compensation in 2018.  This annual
contribution provided an automatic contribution of 3% of pay plus a matching contribution of 50% on the first 7% of pay not
covered by company contributions to our 401(k) Plan.  This contribution was added to the deferred compensation accounts
of eligible employees who were employed at year-end 2018, which included all our participating NEOs.  This benefit is
designed to supplement 401(k) contributions that are limited under the Code.
Withdrawals/Distributions
Contributions to deferred compensation accounts are required to be distributed following an eligible employee’s
separation from service.  Subject to Section 409A of the Code, eligible employees may elect to receive separation from
service withdrawals in the form of a lump-sum payment or monthly installments over two to 20 years.  Eligible employees
may change the method in which payments are distributed provided that they do so at least 12 months before the date of
distribution; however, any change results in the distribution occurring or beginning five years later than it would have
otherwise.  All of our NEOs are ‘‘specified employees’’ under Section 409A of the Code.  Distributions to specified
employees cannot be made until at least the seventh month after separation from service, except in the event of death.

(1)Values for equity awards were determined as follows: (i) for stock options, the number of shares that would have been exercisab le multiplied by the difference between
the fair market value of our common stock on December 27, 2019, the last trading day of our 2019 fiscal year, and the applicabl e exercise price; (ii) for RSUs, PUs and
MSUs, the number of shares that would have been acquired or forfeited on vesting multiplied by the fair market value of our com mon stock on December 27, 2019.
(2)Mr. Gravanis and Ms. Miller qualified as retirement eligible at the end of fiscal year 2019 because they had reached the age of  55 and had completed over ten years of
service with our company.  As a result, in every termination scenario, all of their unvested equity awards would vest, with unve sted PUs and MSUs vesting on a prorated
basis after the respective performance period based on our actual performance.
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, in the event of termination, our NEOs would be entitled to receive
their accrued and vested benefits under any deferred compensation plan in which they participate.  These amounts would
be determined and paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan, and are not included in the table.  See
2019 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation  for information on these benefits.

74None of our NEOs has an employment contract, and all of them are employed at-will; if an NEO were no longer
performing at the expected level, he or she could be terminated for cause immediately without receiving a
contractually-guaranteed payment. The other potential payments upon termination or a change of control are described
below.
Each of our NEOs is a participant in the Severance Plan.  Upon involuntary termination not for cause, they currently
would be entitled to the benefits shown below.

In February 2020, the Compensation Committee amended and restated the Severance Plan, effective July 1,
2020, to provide that the AIP award portion of the Severance Plan payment be changed from the highest AIP award
received during the last three years to the target AIP award for the year of termination.
Benefits Not Subject to Gross up.  Benefits are subject to withholding for all applicable taxes and not grossed-up for

77As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are providing
this disclosure about the relationship between the median annual total compensation of our employees to the annual total
compensation of our CEO.  We are located in countries around the world to best serve our customers, with approximately
77% of our revenues generated outside the U.S. and approximately 33% of our revenues generated in emerging markets
(Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Middle East/Northern Africa).  As a global organization with employees located in
over 50 countries, approximately 87% of our employees are located outside the U.S. and approximately 71% are located in
emerging markets, where median compensation is substantially lower than it is in the U.S.
The charts shown below provide a breakdown of our global employee population by region and function.  Nearly
20,000 of our approximately 33,000 employees, representing over 60% of our global workforce, are in Asia, serving our
customers in that region.  In addition, approximately 65% of our global workforce works in the operations of our
manufacturing facilities worldwide or in positions directly supporting them from other locations.

Europe

Latin America 62%16%13%9%Workforce by Function

65%35%
Our compensation philosophy is to offer market-based, competitive wages and benefits in all the markets where we
compete for talent – all of our employees were paid at least the applicable minimum wage, and 98% of our employees were
paid above  the applicable legal minimum wage at the end of 2019.  Our CEO’s compensation is driven by pay for
performance, commensurate with that provided by companies of similar size, scope, complexity and performance.
• The annual total compensation of our median employee (among all employees except for our CEO) was
approximately $12,278.
• Our CEO’s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total  column of the 2019 Summary Compensation
Table , was $8,495,032.
• Based on this information, a reasonable estimate of the 2019 ratio of the annual total compensation of our
CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee was approximately 692 to 1.
We calculated this ratio based on the rules and guidance provided by the SEC.  SEC rules allow for varying
methodologies for companies to use in identifying their median employee; other companies may have different workforce
demographics and employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions,
estimates and assumptions in calculating their CEO pay ratios. Consequently, the CEO pay ratios reported by other
companies may not be meaningful for purposes of comparison to our CEO pay ratio.
Given that there were no significant changes in the compensation arrangements of our global workforce from 2018 to
2019 or our global workforce during that period that would cause a significant change in our CEO pay ratio, as allowed by
SEC rules, we are using the same median employee in 2019 as we did in 2018.  However, given that the role of the median
employee identified for 2017 changed in 2018, we identified another employee as the median employee for 2018 from the
same group from which we identified the 2017 median employee.  The employee identified for 2018 had comparable pay
77CEO PAY RATIO
2019 PAY RATIO
IDENTIFICATION OF MEDIAN EMPLOYEE
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement78to the median employee in 2017 but best represented the compensation of the employees in this group given the 2017
median employee’s role change.
For purposes of identifying our median employee in 2017 from the same group from which we identified our median
employee in 2018 given the 2017 median employee’s role change, we considered annual base compensation, which is the
most common pay element for all our employees, as reflected in our global human resources information system.  We
selected this compensation element because it represents the principal broad-based compensation element for the vast
majority of our employees globally.  We measured compensation for purposes of determining the median employee using
the 12-month period ending December 31, 2017. We made cost-of-living adjustments.
We selected November 1, 2017 as the date on which to determine our median employee.  As of that date, we had
30,256 employees, 26,231 of which were located outside of the United States and approximately 21,000 of which were
located in emerging markets.  We utilized the de minimis exemption to eliminate countries representing no more than 5% of
our global population in the aggregate.  The countries excluded were Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Pakistan with 646, 542 and
202 employees, respectively, in the aggregate then representing 4.6% of our global workforce.
To determine our medianable group, we used a statistical sampling approach known as stratified sampling to
concentrate on medianable employees, which were those within a narrow range of the estimated median salary of $9,524,
because these employees were all reasonably likely to be our median employee.  As a result of this statistical sampling
process, we identified 647 employees with a salary within $500 of this amount.  Employees from China represented 51% of
the medianable group; as a result, we narrowed the medianable group to those 329 employees.  Finally, we identified the
nine employees who were potentially our median employee by analyzing additional qualitative and quantitative
characteristics, including pay volatility.
Using the methodology described above, we determined that our median employee for 2019 was a full-time, salaried
employee working at a manufacturing facility in China.  For purposes of this disclosure, we converted the employee’s base
compensation from Chinese Yuan to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of December 1, 2019 of 0.14216662.
In determining the annual total compensation of approximately $12,278 for our median employee, as required by SEC
rules, we calculated the employee’s compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, consistent with
how we determine our CEO’s total compensation for the 2019 Summary Compensation Table .
78MEDIAN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation79The Audit Committee – which is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation (including approval of audit
and non-audit fees) and evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm that audits our financial statements
and internal control over financial reporting – has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as our independent
registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2020, and our Board is seeking stockholder ratification of the appointment.
Stockholder ratification is not required by our Bylaws or applicable laws and regulations.  However, our Board annually
submits this appointment for stockholder ratification as an element of our strong governance program.  If stockholders were
not to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee would reconsider whether or not to retain PwC, but could determine to
do so in the committee’s discretion.  In addition, even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee could
subsequently appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm without stockholder approval if the
committee were to determine that doing so would be in the best interests of our company and stockholders.
Although no formal statement from PwC is planned, representatives of the firm will be present at the Annual Meeting to
answer questions from stockholders.
In determining whether to reappoint PwC, the Audit Committee considered the qualifications, performance, and
independence of the firm and the audit engagement team, the quality of its discussions with PwC, and the fees charged by
PwC for the quality and breadth of services provided.  In connection with the 2020 appointment, the Audit Committee
considered, among other things, the following:
•Audit Quality  – The quality of PwC’s audit and non-audit work, based on its oversight of the firm’s work
product, as well as its discussions with management in executive session without PwC present and its
discussions with PwC in executive session without management present;
•Performance  – PwC’s reports on its quality controls and its performance during our 2019 and prior-year
audits;
•Qualitative Review  – The results of our global survey of members of management and the Audit Committee
evaluating PwC’s (i) expertise and resources, (ii) audit planning, (iii) communication and interaction,
(iv) independence, objectivity and professional skepticism and (v) value for fees;
•Self-Assessment  – PwC’s self-assessment of its accomplishments in connection with the 2019 audit, its
satisfaction of the service needs and expectations of the Audit Committee and management, and areas of
continued focus and improvement opportunities;
•Regulatory Review s – External data on the firm’s audit quality and performance, including recent Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) reports on PwC and its peer firms;
•Reasonableness of Fees  – The appropriateness of PwC’s fees for audit and non-audit services, both on an
absolute basis and relative to comparable firms;
•Independence  – Written disclosures from the firm and the independence letter required by the PCAOB; and
•Tenure  – PwC’s tenure as our independent auditor, including the benefits of having a long-tenured auditor
and the controls we and they have in place to mitigate any potential independence risk.
The Audit Committee has determined that the appointment of PwC is in the best interest of our company and
stockholders.  The Audit Committee has appointed, subject to stockholder ratification, PwC as our independent
registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2020 and recommends that stockholders ratify the appointment at
the Annual Meeting.
Our Board recommends that you vote FOR ratification of the appointment of PwC as our independent registered
public accounting firm for fiscal year 2020. Properly dated and signed proxies will be so voted unless you specify
otherwise.
79ITEM 3 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
AUDIT COMMITTEE EVALUATION
RECOMMENDATION OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement80PwC has been our independent registered public accounting firm since 1998 and served in that capacity during fiscal
year 2019.  Through its predecessor entities, the firm has served as our independent auditor since at least 1960, which was
the first year our financial statements were subject to SEC reporting requirements.  We have been unable to determine the
exact year PwC began serving as the auditor for our company.  PwC is very well-qualified to act as our independent
registered public accounting firm and has a deep understanding of our operations and accounting practices.  Some
governance stakeholders have suggested that long tenure poses a risk to auditor independence.  The Audit Committee
believes, however, that PwC’s years of experience auditing our company confers significant benefits, including the
following:
•Audit Quality  – PwC has deep institutional knowledge regarding our operations, businesses, and accounting
policies and practices;
•Scale – PwC has a global presence with resources in virtually all of the countries in which we do business,
enabling the firm to cost-effectively perform statutory audit work on our subsidiary accounts; and
•Cost – PwC is able to effectively perform the needed audit, audit-related, tax compliance and tax planning
services and ensure audit quality cost-competitively.
In conducting its periodic review of whether to appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit
Committee considers the fact that onboarding a new firm would require a significant time commitment on the part of
management, potentially distracting from the paramount focus on financial reporting and internal controls, without
necessarily increasing audit quality. The Audit Committee also noted that PwC has implemented advanced technological
tools that have improved the firm’s delivery of its assurance procedures.
The Audit Committee has several controls in place to mitigate any potential independence risk, including the following:
•Limits on Non-Audit Services  – The Audit Committee assesses the impact providing non-audit services may
have on PwC’s independence each time it approves the firm’s provision of these services, as well as during its
annual assessment of the firm’s independence;
•Periodic Consideration of Auditor Rotation  – The Audit Committee periodically considers whether to
change the independent registered public accounting firm based on its assessment of PwC’s audit quality,
performance, compensation and independence, having most recently done so in February 2020 and
determined to retain PwC;
•Executive Sessions  – The Audit Committee meets regularly both with PwC without management present and
with management without PwC present; and
•Lead Engagement Partner Selection  – The Audit Committee selects any new lead engagement partner, in
consultation with members of senior management and representatives of PwC.
To regularly bring a fresh perspective to the audit, a new lead engagement partner is designated at least every five
years.  A new partner was designated for the 2019 audit, having shadowed the previous partner in 2018 to ensure service
continuity and knowledge transfer.  The Audit Committee interviewed the partner prior to his designation, and the Audit
Committee was directly responsible for making the selection, in consultation with members of senior management and
representatives from PwC.
PwC has advised us that neither the firm nor any member thereof has any financial interest, direct or indirect, in any
capacity in our company or our subsidiaries.  As a result, PwC has confirmed to the Audit Committee that it is in compliance
with the rules, standards and policies of the PCAOB and the regulations of the SEC governing auditor independence.
The Audit Committee considers the impact providing non-audit services may have on PwC’s independence each time it
approves the firm’s provision of such services, as well as during its annual assessment of the firm’s independence.  In

AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation81February 2020, the Audit Committee reviewed the non-audit services approved by the Committee and provided by PwC
during 2019, including the related fees, and determined that the firm’s provision of these services did not impair PwC’s
independence.
In negotiating and approving PwC’s fees and services, the Audit Committee considers whether PwC is best positioned
to provide the services effectively and efficiently due to its familiarity with our operations, businesses, accounting policies
and practices, internal controls, and financial and information technology systems, as well as whether the services enhance
our ability to manage or control risks and maintain audit quality.  The Audit Committee periodically receives updates on the
services rendered and fees paid to PwC to ensure that they are within the parameters approved by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee has adopted procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided by the
independent registered public accounting firm, and the fees paid to PwC in 2019 were pre-approved.  The Audit
Committee pre-approved the estimated audit fees in February 2019, received a mid-year update on year-to-date fees
incurred in July, and assessed the final fees in connection with its review of the results of the audit in February 2020.  These
procedures include reviewing and approving a plan for audit and permitted non-audit services, which includes a description
of, and estimated fees for, audit services and non-audit services.  Additional Audit Committee approval is required for
non-audit services not included in the initial plan or substantially in excess of the budgeted amount for the particular
category of services.  The Audit Committee has delegated interim pre-approval authority to its Chair for services not
included in the audit plan; these services are reviewed with the entire Audit Committee at a subsequent meeting.
For fiscal years 2019 and 2018, PwC provided the services shown below for our company – all of which were approved
by the Audit Committee using the procedures described above – for which we paid the firm the fees indicated.

Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement82The Audit and Finance Committee (referred to in this report as the ‘‘Committee’’) of our Board of Directors is comprised
of the directors named at the end of this report, each of whom meets the enhanced independence and experience
standards for audit committee members set forth in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE) listing standards.  Our Board of Directors has determined all members to be financially literate and
designated each of Messrs. Anderson, Barker and Siewert as an ‘‘audit committee financial expert’’ under applicable SEC
regulations.  Members of the Committee are prohibited from sitting on the audit committee of more than two other public
companies, and all members are in compliance with this restriction.
The Committee has a written charter adopted by our Board of Directors, which is available under Corporate
Governance in the investors section of our website.  The Committee annually reviews the charter and recommends changes
to the Board for approval.  The charter was last amended in December 2018.
During fiscal year 2019, the Committee primarily performed the following activities on behalf of our Board of Directors:
• Reviewed and discussed with management and the independent registered public accounting firm our
quarterly and annual financial results, earnings release documentation and the related reports filed with the
SEC;
• Reviewed and discussed with management, the Vice President of Internal Audit and the independent
registered public accounting firm our internal controls report and the independent registered public
accounting firm’s attestation thereof;
• Evaluated the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent registered public
accounting firm and met with representatives of the firm to discuss the scope, budget, staffing and progress
of the firm’s audit;
• Supervised the Vice President of Internal Audit with respect to the scope, budget, staffing and progress of the
internal audit and evaluated his personal performance, as well as the performance of the internal audit
function; and
• Discussed significant financial risk exposures, including our cybersecurity risk management program and risks
related to our company’s information technology controls and security, and the steps taken by management
to monitor and control these exposures.
Management is responsible for our consolidated financial statements, accounting and financial reporting policies,
internal control over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures.  The Committee appointed the
independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to provide audit, audit-related and
tax compliance services, with limited tax planning and other non-audit services to the extent approved by the Committee.
PwC was responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and issuing an opinion on the conformity of those
financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  The
Committee’s responsibility is to monitor and oversee our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of our
consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting.  The members of the Committee are not
professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and rely without independent verification on the
information provided to them and the representations made by management and PwC.
The Committee reviewed and discussed our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for the fiscal year
ended December 28, 2019 – including our company’s critical accounting policies and management’s significant estimates
and judgments – with management and PwC, as well as PwC’s report and unqualified opinion on the audit.  Management
represented to the Committee and PwC that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES
OVERSIGHT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation83GAAP .  PwC presented the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit
Committees,  as adopted by the PCAOB and currently in effect.  The Committee received these written disclosures and the
letters from PwC required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding communications concerning
independence – including Rule 3524, Audit Committee Pre-approval of Certain Tax Services , and Rule 3526,
Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence – and discussed with PwC its independence from our
company and management.
Based on the Committee’s review and discussions with management and PwC described above, as well as the
Committee’s review of the representations of management and the audit report and unqualified opinion of PwC, the
Committee recommended that our Board of Directors approve the inclusion of the audited consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 28, 2019 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
The Committee’s responsibility is to appoint the independent registered public accounting firm, and monitor and
oversee the firm’s qualifications, compensation, performance and independence.  In this capacity, the Committee reviewed
with PwC the overall scope of and fees for its audit, and monitored the progress of PwC’s audit in assessing our compliance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including the firm’s findings and required resources.
PwC provided to the Committee the written disclosures and independence letter required by the PCAOB.  The
Committee discussed with PwC its independence from our company and management and concluded that PwC was
independent during fiscal year 2019.  The Committee has a policy requiring pre-approval of fees for audit, audit-related, tax
and other services and has concluded that PwC’s provision of limited non-audit services to our company in 2019 was
compatible with maintaining its independence.
Under its charter, the Committee is required to periodically consider whether it is appropriate to change the
independent registered public accounting firm, and the Committee most recently evaluated with management and PwC
whether it may be appropriate to do so in February 2020, with a view to ensuring that audit quality would continue to be
paramount.  The Committee determined at that time to retain PwC.
The Committee has determined that the appointment of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for
fiscal year 2020 is in the best interest of our company and stockholders.  The Committee has appointed PwC in such
capacity and recommends that stockholders ratify the appointment at the Annual Meeting.
The Committee’s responsibility is to monitor and oversee our internal audit function, reviewing the significant audit
results reported to management and management’s responses thereto.  In this capacity, the Committee reviews with the
Vice President of Internal Audit the overall scope and budget for the internal audit, and regularly monitors the progress of
the internal audit in assessing our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including the Vice
President of Internal Audit’s key findings and required resources.  The Committee directly supervises the Vice President of

Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement86Both our Code of Conduct and Conflict of Interest Policy (our ‘‘COI Policy’’) provide that conflicts of interest should be
avoided.  Under our Governance Guidelines, directors are expected to comply with the Code of Conduct and avoid any
action, position or interest that conflicts with the interests of our company, or gives the appearance of a conflict.  Our COI
Policy proscribes any of our officers (including our executive officers) or employees – or any of their immediate family
members – from directly or indirectly doing business, seeking to do business or owning an interest in an entity that does
business or seeks to do business with our company without approval in writing from the Governance Committee.  Under our
COI Policy, any officer or employee who has a question as to the interpretation of the policy or its application to a specific
activity, transaction or situation may submit the question in writing to our General Counsel/Secretary for any further
necessary review by the Governance Committee.
On an annual basis, all of our employees at the level of manager and above are required to complete a compliance
certification in which they must (i) disclose, among other things, whether they or any of their immediate family members
have a job, contract or other position with an entity that has commercial dealings with our company and (ii) certify that they
have complied with our COI Policy and Code of Conduct.  Non-supervisory professionals in our sales, marketing, customer
service and purchasing functions complete this certification in even years, and non-supervisory professionals in our
technology, finance, supply chain, technical services, environmental, health and safety, legal and risk functions do so in odd
years.  All disclosures are reviewed by our compliance department in consultation with our law department and senior
management to determine whether the activity has the potential to significantly influence our business.  The Governance
Committee receives a report from our Chief Compliance Officer on the disclosures elicited in the annual compliance
certification and, in the event that an unresolved disclosure potentially gives rise to a conflict of interest, determines whet her
a conflict of interest exists or whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the activity, transaction or situation would
influence the individual’s judgment or actions in performing his or her duties for our company.
In addition, each of our directors and executive officers annually completes a questionnaire designed to solicit
information about any potential related person transactions.  Transactions involving directors are reviewed with the
Governance Committee by the General Counsel/Secretary in connection with the annual assessment of director
independence and review of related person transactions.  Responses from executive officers are reviewed by our Chief
Compliance Officer with oversight by the Governance Committee in the event any transactions are identified.
We review internal financial records to identify transactions with security holders known by us from information
contained in Schedules 13D or 13G filed with the SEC to be beneficial owners of more than five percent of our common
stock to determine whether we have any relationships with the security holders that might constitute related person
transactions under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  In the event of any findings, our General Counsel/Secretary discusses
them with the Governance Committee.
During fiscal year 2019, there were no related person transactions requiring disclosure under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K.  To our knowledge, all related person transactions were subject to review under our policies and
procedures.

2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation87We expect to mail or make available our 2019 Annual Report to all stockholders of record on or about March 10, 2020.
We have elected to provide access to our proxy materials on the Internet.  Accordingly, we are sending the Notice of
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the ‘‘Notice’’) to our stockholders of record.  Brokers, banks and other nominees
(collectively, ‘‘nominees’’) who hold shares on behalf of beneficial owners (also called ‘‘street name’’ holders) will send a
similar notice.  You will have the ability to access our proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice.  Instructions on
how to request printed proxy materials by mail, including an option to receive paper copies in the future, may be found in
the Notice and on the website referred to in the Notice.
On or about March 10, 2020, we intend to make this proxy statement available on the Internet and mail the Notice to all
stockholders entitled to vote.  We intend to mail this proxy statement, together with a proxy card, to stockholders entitled to
vote at the Annual Meeting who have previously requested paper copies on or about March 10, 2020.  In addition, if you
request paper copies of these materials for the first time, they will be mailed within three business days of request.  If you
hold your shares in street name, you may request paper copies of the proxy statement and proxy card from your nominee by
following the instructions on the notice your nominee provides to you.
Stockholders of record may obtain a copy of this proxy statement without charge by writing to our Corporate Secretary,
Avery Dennison Corporation, 207 Goode Avenue, Glendale, California 91203.
We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called householding. Under this procedure, we will deliver a single
copy of our 2019 integrated report, which includes our 2019 annual report and 2020 notice and proxy statement, to
stockholders sharing the same address. Householding allows us to reduce our printing and postage costs and prevents
duplicative information from being received at your household.  Our use of householding affects only the delivery of proxy
materials; it does not impact the delivery of dividend checks.
For holders who share a single address, we are sending only one integrated report to that address unless we have
received instructions to the contrary from any stockholder at that address.  If you wish to receive an additional copy of our
integrated report, or if you receive multiple copies of our integrated report and wish to receive a single copy in the future,
you may make your request by writing to our Corporate Secretary at Avery Dennison Corporation, 207 Goode Avenue,
Glendale, California 91203.
If you are a street name holder and wish to revoke your consent to householding and receive separate copies of our
proxy statement and annual report in future years, you may call Broadridge Investor Communications Services toll-free at
866.540.7095 in the U.S. and Canada or write them c/o Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New
York 11717.
Instead of receiving paper copies of proxy statements and annual reports by mail in the future, you can elect to receive
an email that will provide a link to these documents on the Internet. By electing to access proxy materials on the Internet,
you will be able to access them more quickly, save us the cost of printing and mailing them to you, reduce the amount of
mail you receive from us, and help us preserve environmental resources.
You may enroll to access proxy materials and annual reports electronically for future Annual Meetings by registering
online at the following website: https://enroll.icsdelivery.com/avy.  If you are voting on the Internet, you can follow the link s

Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement88Stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 24, 2020 are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
Annual Meeting.  Our common stock is the only class of shares outstanding, and there were 83,295,966 shares of common
stock outstanding on February 24, 2020.  The list of stockholders entitled to vote will be available for inspection at the
Annual Meeting, as well as starting 10 days before the Annual Meeting during regular business hours at our company
headquarters.  You are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on the record date.
You may vote by submitting a proxy or voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  If you hold your shares in street name,
you may only vote in person at the meeting if you properly request and receive a legal proxy in your name from the nominee
that holds your shares.
The method of voting by proxy differs depending on whether you are viewing this proxy statement on the Internet or
reviewing a paper copy, as follows:
• If you are viewing this proxy statement on the Internet, you may vote your shares by (i) submitting a proxy on
the Internet by following the instructions on the website or (ii) requesting a paper copy of the proxy materials
and following one of the methods described below; and
• If you are reviewing a paper copy of this proxy statement, you may vote your shares by (i) submitting a proxy
by telephone or on the Internet by following the instructions on the proxy card or (ii) completing, dating and
signing the proxy card included with the proxy statement and returning it in the preaddressed, postage paid
envelope provided.
We encourage you to vote by proxy by telephone or on the Internet since these methods immediately record your vote
and allow you to confirm that your votes have been properly recorded.  Telephone and Internet voting facilities close at
11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 22, 2020.
Shares acquired through our Direct Share Purchase and Sale Program may be voted by following the procedures
described above.
If you hold shares as a participant in our Employee Savings (401(k)) Plan, your vote serves as a voting instruction to
Fidelity Management Trust Company, the trustee of the plan, on how to vote the shares you hold through the plan.  Your
voting instruction must be received by the trustee by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 20, 2020.
If the trustee does not receive your instruction in a timely manner, your shares will be voted in the same proportion as
the shares voted by participants in the plan who timely furnish instructions.   Shares of our common stock that have not been
allocated to participant accounts will also be voted by the trustee in the same proportion as the shares voted by participants
in the plan who timely furnish instructions.
If you give a proxy pursuant to this solicitation, you may revoke it at any time before it is acted upon at the Annual
Meeting by (i) submitting another proxy by telephone or on the Internet (only your last voting instructions will be counted);
(ii) sending a later dated paper proxy; (iii) delivering to our Corporate Secretary a written notice of revocation prior to the
voting of the proxy at the Annual Meeting; or (iv) if you are entitled to do so, voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  Simply
attending the Annual Meeting will not revoke your proxy.

HOW DO I REVOKE MY PROXY OR CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE VOTED?
2020 Proxy Statement Avery Dennison Corporation89If your shares are held in street name, you may only change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your
nominee.  You must contact your nominee to find out how you can change your vote.  Shares held in our Employee Savings
Plan cannot be changed or revoked after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 20, 2020, nor can they be voted in person at the
Annual Meeting.
Except in contested proxy solicitations, when required by law or as expressly authorized by you (such as by making a
written comment on your proxy card, in which case the comment, but not your vote, will be shared with our company), your
vote or voting instruction is confidential and will not be disclosed other than to the broker, trustee, agent or other entity
tabulating your vote.
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., the
independent inspector of election appointed by our Board.  The inspector of election will also determine whether a quorum
is present.  At the Annual Meeting, shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions or ‘‘broker non-votes’’ (which are
shares held by a nominee that are represented at the meeting, but with respect to which the nominee neither has
discretionary authority to vote nor has been given actual authority to vote on a particular item) will be counted as shares tha t
are present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.  Items 1 and
2 are ‘‘non-routine’’ under the rules of the NYSE, and Item 3 is routine.  Nominees are prohibited from voting on non-routine
items in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owners of the shares; as a result, if you hold your shares in street
name and do not submit voting instructions to your nominee, your shares will not be voted on Item 1, election of directors,
or Item 2, approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation.  We urge you to promptly provide voting
instructions to your nominee so that your vote is counted.
The vote required to approve each of the Annual Meeting items, as well as the impact of abstentions and broker
non-votes, is shown in the chart below.

If any other business properly comes before the meeting, your vote will be cast on any such other business in accordance
with the best judgment of the individuals acting pursuant to your proxy.
We expect to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and report final voting results in a Current
Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on or before April 29, 2020.

91HOW DO I NOMINATE DIRECTORS FOR INCLUSION IN THE 2021 PROXY STATEMENT?
Avery Dennison Corporation 2020 Proxy Statement92We report our financial results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, or GAAP , and also communicate with investors using certain non-GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP
financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for or superior to, the comparable GAAP financial
measures.  These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the presentation of our financial results that are
prepared in accordance with GAAP . Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that the
supplemental non-GAAP financial measures we provide are useful to their assessment of our performance and operating
trends, as well as liquidity.
Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions.  The
accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it
difficult to assess our underlying performance in a single period.  By excluding the accounting effects, both positive or
negative, of certain items (such as restructuring charges, legal settlements, certain effects of strategic transactions and
related costs, losses from debt extinguishments, gains or losses from curtailment or settlement of pension obligations, gains
or losses on sales of certain assets, and other items), we believe that we are providing meaningful supplemental information
that facilitates an understanding of our core operating results and liquidity measures.  While some of the items we exclude
from GAAP financial measures recur, they tend to be disparate in amount, frequency, or timing.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate trends in our underlying performance, as well as to
facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period.
We use the following non-GAAP financial measures in this proxy statement:
•Sales change ex. currency  refers to the increase or decrease in net sales excluding the estimated impact of
foreign currency translation, and, where applicable, currency adjustment for transitional reporting of highly
inflationary economies (Argentina). Segment results are also adjusted for the reclassification of sales between
segments.  The estimated impact of foreign currency translation is calculated on a constant currency basis,
with prior period results translated at current period average exchange rates to exclude the effect of currency
fluctuations.
•Organic sales change  refers to sales change ex. currency, excluding the estimated impact of product line
exits, acquisitions and divestitures, and, where applicable, the extra week in our fiscal year.
We believe that sales change ex. currency and organic sales change assist investors in evaluating the sales change from the
ongoing activities of our businesses and enhance their ability to evaluate our results from period to period.
•Adjusted net income per common share, assuming dilution (adjusted EPS) , refers to adjusted net income
divided by weighted average number of common shares outstanding, assuming dilution.  Adjusted net
income is income from continuing operations before taxes, tax-effected at the adjusted tax rate, and adjusted
for tax-effected restructuring charges and other items.  Adjusted tax rate is the full-year GAAP tax rate,
adjusted to exclude certain unusual or infrequent events that are expected to significantly impact that rate,
such as impacts related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and our U.S. pension plan
termination, effects of certain discrete tax planning actions, and other items.  We believe that adjusted EPS
assists investors in understanding our core operating trends and comparing our results with those of our
competitors.
•Free cash flow  refers to cash flow provided by operating activities, less payments for property, plant and
equipment, software and other deferred charges, plus proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment,
plus (minus) net proceeds from insurance and sales (purchases) of investments.  Free cash flow is also
adjusted for the cash contributions related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan.  We believe that free
cash flow assists investors by showing the amount of cash we have available for debt reductions, dividends,
share repurchases, and acquisitions.
•Return on total capital (ROTC)  refers to net income excluding the expense and tax benefit of debt financing
divided by the average of beginning and ending invested capital. Adjusted  ROTC refers to ROTC adjusted
for the impact of the TCJA and pension plan settlements.  We believe that ROTC and adjusted ROTC assist
investors in understanding our ability to generate returns from our capital.
•Adjusted EBIT  refers to earnings before interest expense and taxes, excluding non-cash restructuring costs,
as well as other items.  We believe that adjusted EBIT assists investors in understanding our core operating
trends and comparing our results with those of our competitors.  We use adjusted EBIT to calculate economic
value added (EVA), one of the performance objectives used in our long-term incentive compensation
program.
