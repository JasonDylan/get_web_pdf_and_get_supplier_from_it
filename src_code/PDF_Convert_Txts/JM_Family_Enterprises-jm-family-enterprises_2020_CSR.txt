WELCOME MESSAGE
from the President & CEO5
When we entered 2020, no one could have predicted where the year would soon lead. In March, 
like so many others, we found ourselves facing uncertainty in all areas of our lives after being thrust 
into a global pandemic. Our associates showed resilience and innovation while quickly adapting 
to the world unfolding around us. Almost overnight, our business locations transitioned to a new 
COVID-19 pandemic mode that saw many of us working from home while others adapting to doing 
their jobs onsite, socially distanced, wearing masks and keeping each other safe. 
In true JM Family fashion, we rallied together and shifted to meet the needs of our associates, 
dealers, franchisees and communities. We launched new digital solutions, virtual sales tools and 
training efforts. We shared these online options with our customers in order to help them meet 
the safety and comfort needs of their consumers. We also found new ways for our associates 
to stay connected with the communities where we live and work and raised a record amount of 
contributions for our nonprofit partners in need. 
Despite the unique challenges 2020 presented, we rose to the occasion time and again and 
generated revenue of $16 billion. We revealed our refreshed logo and opened the doors to three 
state-of-the-art buildings at our headquarters in Deerfield Beach, Florida, and a new vehicle 
processing facility in Commerce, Georgia. We introduced JM Family Holdings & Services, a newly 
formed division of our company, and we celebrated the acquisition of Kitchen Tune-Up by Home 
Franchise Concepts. 
This year our Impact Report includes new sections that reflect JM Family’s response to the 
pandemic, and our enhanced efforts toward a more diverse and inclusive workplace. 
I could not be prouder of the way we navigated 2020 and carried that momentum forward into 
2021. Our founder Jim Moran, affectionately known as the Boss, regarded every associate as family. 
And while we always knew it, 2020 showed us that, like a family, we are always stronger together.

DIVERSITY , EQUITY
& INCLUSION
At JM Family, we are not all the same, and that in part 
is what makes us a great place to work. Our differences 
are also our greatest strengths, which is why we’ve made 
it a priority in 2020 and moving forward to expand our 
awareness and foster a deeper learning and respect for the 
diverse cultures and religions that make up our workplace 
and the world. 
Through this broader understanding of each other, we
can form better relationships and strengthen our culture 
of inclusion. RANKED

AfricanAmericanAchievers.com 
Our founder Jim Moran established the 
African-American Achievers awards program 
in 1992 to recognize and celebrate individuals 
who selflessly give their time and talents to 
improve our communities. 
JM Family announced four outstanding 
individuals in the categories of Arts & Culture, 
Business & Entrepreneurism, Community 
Service and Education. 
To show our appreciation for their impact to 
our community, JM Family, Southeast Toyota 
and JM Lexus donated $40,000 to local 
nonprofits, which included a $10,000 gift in 
each Achiever’s name to the charity(ies) of his 
or her choice. This brings our total donations 
through the African-American Achievers 
program to more than $650,000. 
In addition, a Youth Achiever was awarded a 
needs-based, four-year scholarship to Florida 
State University. JM Family also developed 
a new paid internship exclusively for African-
American Youth Achievers. 
We expanded our celebration of  
Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a day of service –  
a new company tradition where associates can 
choose to volunteer to make a difference in 
their communities.

RESPONSE
Working Together  
in a Time of Crisis  
As the world began to feel 
the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, JM Family moved 
quickly to meet the challenges. 
Our priority has always been 
the health and well-being of our 
associates and as a result, we 
increased our safety measures 
across our businesses and
made operational changes to 
enhance our standards. 
We will continue to do so
during these uncertain times. Temperature Checks & Masks
All associates are required to wear a
mask/face covering, and we strongly 
encourage them to continue healthy 
hygiene habits like frequent hand-washing. 
Associates also complete a daily health 
self-check and temperature screening
when reporting to work onsite.  
Social Distancing
To ensure social distancing is maintained, 
we have limited the number of associates 
on campus and in attendance at company 
events. In job roles that must be performed 
onsite, we’ve modified work spaces to  
ensure our associates’ safety. Cleaning & Disinfecting
We have undertaken a stringent  
approach to cleaning and disinfecting  
high-touch areas to help reduce the risk  
of spreading illnesses.  The Health and Safety of Our 
Associates is Our Top Priority

Expanding Associates’  
Benefits 
Our associates are our most important 
asset, and we’re proud of their resilience, 
flexibility and  commitment to our core 
values. We continue to invest in them and 
support them when their health is at risk.   
Pandemic Paid Leave
We provide a generous paid leave (up to 
80 hours) to associates for any COVID-19 
related reason. Additionally, we also offer a 
Pandemic Emergency Leave and a revised 
Company Given Time “bucket” to be 
used if an associate is unable to effectively 
work from home but needed time off to 
recover from an illness, care for a sick family 
member or care for their children.  
Mental Health
We provided our associates with a series of 
mindfulness videos and other resources to 
help reduce stress and anxiety.Increased Leader Communication
JM Family leaders ensured associates were 
well-informed during every stage of the 
pandemic. Our Chief Medical Officer 
Dr. Kenneth Burke filmed weekly videos 
providing important updates about the virus. 
Our Executive Management Team, including 
CEO/President Brent Burns, also filmed regular 
Business Unit updates from home via their 
iPhone to keep associates aware and engaged 
on company progress. And, Carmen Johnson, 
our Executive Vice President of Legal/HR, 
shared semi-monthly Business Operations 
Update emails including details on pandemic 
leave, resources for working parents, virtual 
development opportunities and more. 
Plexiglass Partitions
We installed plexiglass
partitions in our cafés, various lobby
entrances and mailrooms to provide
a safer work environment.  
Remote Work
We transitioned the majority of  
associates to work from home  
unless essential. 30

ENVIRONMENTAL
ACTION
We believe that giving back to the communities where our 
associates live and work is tightly connected to conducting 
business with consideration for the environment.  
While the COVID-19 pandemic presented many challenges 
and obstacles to overcome, it also provided short-term 
positive impacts on JM Family’s environmental footprint. 
With many of our associates working from home and 
traveling less frequently, we operated our facilities and 
conducted business with limited resource consumption  
and fewer carbon emissions. In 2020, we introduced two state-of the-
art campuses slated to receive LEED 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design) certification at our Commerce, 
Georgia vehicle processing facility and at our 
headquarters in Deerfield Beach, Florida. 
Commerce, Georgia  
The vehicle processing facility was 
completed in June and designed to use 
44% less energy as compared to similar 
standard buildings. The site features 100% 
LED-lighting, low-flow plumbing fixtures 
that yield a 35% indoor water use reduction, 
high-mounted glass windows for daylight 
harvesting and water retention ponds to 
promote natural filtration of stormwater.  
The site also hosts a 1.3 mega-watt capacity 
solar array. Deerfield Beach, Florida
The Deerfield Beach Campus, which is still 
under construction, welcomed four new 
structures in 2020 including two office 
buildings, a two-story dining facility and a 
parking garage. The headquarters project 
highlights our focus on the environment 
through the addition of rainwater harvesting 
which will yield approximately 65% of 
irrigation usage, and over 3,000 rooftop 
solar panels, allowing the Deerfield campus 
to derive roughly 20% of energy from clean, 
renewable resources.   
DataScan, Georgia  
Our DataScan site officially received LEED 
Gold certification at the new City Center 
site. The state-of-the-art facility features a 
22.7-kilowatt (kW) capacity rooftop solar 
array, LED lighting and water efficient 
plumbing fixtures designed to reduce 
consumption by over 30% as compared  
to conventional buildings.
