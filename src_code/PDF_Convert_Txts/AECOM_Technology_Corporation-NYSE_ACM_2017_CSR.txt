THE FUTURE IS UNKNOWN.  
PREPARING FOR IT REQUIRES RESILIENCE.2 3DESCRIPTOR
THE FUTURE …
It is opportunity and disruption. Innovation 
and obsolescence. Calm and crisis. In a word, 
it is unknown. 
Preparing for it requires resilience. 
Our collective ability to plan for, respond 
to and recover from the unexpected has 
never been more important. We live in a 
world of extreme weather, diminishing 
natural resources and rapidly evolving global 
tensions. Building more resilient institutions, 
infrastructure and communities is key to 
progressing toward a more sustainable planet.
Many of these events were 
exacerbated by changing 
climate conditions, producing 
wetter storms, drier forests, 
and unprecedented storm-
water flooding. Many more 
were the result of human error, 
neglect or outright malice. 
While 2017 is behind us, the 
underlying problems of climate 
change, extreme weather, 
global terrorism, cyber-warfare 
and many other uniquely 21st 
century threats have just 
begun to make their mark on 
our world. Anticipating and 
preparing for the impact they 
will have in the future must be 
a part of every organization’s 
planning today. At AECOM, we 
believe that resilience is an 
essential step forward on the 
path to sustainability.JULY-SEPTEMBER:  Southeast Asia was hit 
with one of the worst monsoon seasons 
in history, causing widespread flooding 
throughout Bangladesh, India, Nepal and 
Pakistan. By September, an estimated 45 
million had been affected and more than 
1,000 killed.
AUGUST: Hurricane Harvey battered Texas, 
Louisiana and parts of Central America, 
causing an estimated $260 billion worth 
of damage and hundreds of fatalities. 
As the United States was still reeling 
from the devastation of Harvey, 
further east Hurricane Irma began her 
destructive path across the Caribbean 
and Florida.
SEPTEMBER:  Hurricane Maria, a category 
five hurricane, made landfall on the 
island of Dominica. Reaching winds of 
280km/h, causing most damage to the 
eastern Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, 
Dominican Republic and The Bahamas.
An earthquake measuring 8.2 on 
the Richter scale hit the Gulf of 
Tehuantepec, off the coast of Chiapas, 
southern Mexico.
OCTOBER: Fires ignited the United 
States’ Southern California region, 
charring over 280,000 acres and 
destroying over 1,000 structures.THE YEAR NATURAL

PREPARING FOR DISASTER 
IN A WORLD OF EXTREMES
In September 2017, Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico and propelled 3.4 million residents into a crisis. The 
Category 5 hurricane raised havoc, downing power lines, destroying homes, knocking out transportation and 
limiting access to clean water.
Building resilience into our institutions, our infrastructure, our systems and our communities has never 
been more important. This goes beyond standard risk assessment and mitigation planning. It requires a 
willingness to imagine the unimaginable and create defenses that can weather their occurrence.CHAPTER 1

PROJECT INSIGHTS:
AECOM TEAMS ANTICIPATE AND  
RESPOND IN THE EYE OF THE STORM
Anticipating Natural Disasters:
With the significant wind 
damage and flooding along the 
U.S. Gulf Coast from Hurricane 
Harvey, record-breaking 
rainfall throughout Southeast 
T exas and the direct impact 
of Hurricane Irma on Puerto 
Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and 
Florida, the need for disaster 
recovery personnel to deploy 
to these hard-hit areas, the 
need was greater than ever.
Throughout hurricane 
seasons, AECOM’s emergency 
management teams and local 
resilience teams rigorously 
track weather patterns 
around areas prone to natural 
disasters. We had boots on 
the ground in several of 2017’s 
most devastating events, 
including Puerto Rico. 
Our procedures are aligned 
with U.S. government and 
local requirements, and we 
have multiple contracts with 
the United States’ Federal 
Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) that allow us to 
rapidly deploy staff.Acting in Puerto Rico:
Files were backed up to 
safeguard client data and 
employees were advised to 
seek shelter.
Hundreds of AECOM staff 
members were deployed to 
aid in Puerto Rico’s recovery 
efforts. From packaging 
more than 60,000 meals 
for survivors to working on 
temporary assignments 
requiring expertise in civil 
structural, power distribution, 
architecture, water/wastewater 
or coastal engineering.
Our local, cross-functional 
resilience team met daily to 
provide support before, during 
and after the event. 
Alternative office space was 
identified with reliable power 
and air conditioning, and server 
access was quickly restored so 
those who were able to work 
could do so remotely. 
GoFundMe campaigns were 
created to support impacted 
colleagues in need, raising a 
combined US$350,000 in both 
employee and corporate giving.Advancing our learnings: 
The intensity of Hurricane Maria 
was unprecedented and the 
extent of the damage caught 
many off guard. Now, nearly 
a year after the storm hit, the 
island’s power grid remains 
fragile and some remote areas 
are still without power. 
While the team succeeded 
confronting many challenges, 
valuable lessons were learned, 
including the need to invest 
in redundant power supplies 
and the need for better 
communication processes to 
proactively check on our people. 
T o enable an integrated 
approach to disaster relief 
efforts, AECOM has created a 
virtual Disaster Relief Project 
Management Organization 
(PMO) that will coordinate and 
bring together our collective 
expertise to disaster relief 
efforts. Our Disaster Relief PMO 
will enable cross functional 
teams to quickly act when 
disasters happen and anticipate 
future disasters whether natural, 
man-made, or combined.CHAPTER 1

LEADERSHIP SPOTLIGHT:
BUILDING ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE  
FOR OUR PEOPLE AND CLIENTS
Organizational resilience is about 
collaborating to anticipate, protect 
against and manage disruptive 
events when they occur. At 
AECOM, we think about it in two 
ways: making sure our people are 
safe and minimizing disruption to 
our business and our clients. 
Given the nature of the work 
AECOM’s nearly 87,000 
employees deliver globally — from 
large infrastructure projects to 
supporting secure government 
facilities to designing solutions that 
can withstand both natural and 
man-made disasters — resiliency 
touches everything we do.
How do organizations survive 
adversity? 
We enable operational 
productivity and profit through 
security and resilience 
specialists, technologies and 
processes. We focus on open 
channels of communication, 
functional collaboration and 
interdependencies between 
businesses, our communities, and 
relevant government agencies 
to minimize disruptions and 
empower recovery efforts.Crisis preparation is a crucial 
subset of resilience planning. 
Anticipation, a well-understood and 
swiftly executed recovery plan, and 
a strong network of collaborative 
partners are all important elements 
in successfully facing down and 
surviving a crisis. The best defense 
is a strong offense, and we have 
some of the best and brightest 
minds working to help protect our 
people and clients from threats.
What are three essential elements 
to organizational resilience in the 
face of natural disasters?
1. ANTICIPATE: Whether you are 
pursuing an opportunity, developing 
a contractual scope of work or 
engaging in project planning, start 
strong by using foresight. Develop 
a risk management plan that 
considers threats unique to your 
business, operations, region, societal 
strains and emerging trends. 
2. ACT COLLABORATIVELY:  The 
bedrock of organizational 
resilience is your workforce; it is 
our cross-functional emergency 
and resilience teams who lead 
during times of disruption. These 
teams across the globe focus on identifying threats — whether 
cyber, sociopolitical, physical or 
environmental — before they hit, 
and creating strong and effective 
countermeasures that safeguard 
our data, people, projects and 
communities. These teams are 
composed of representatives 
from communications, human 
resources, legal, facilities, finance, 
safety, security, information 
technology, procurement and real 
estate to help anticipate, act and 
learn from disruptive events.
3. ADVANCE AND COMMUNICATE:  
Have a road map and 
communication protocols in place 
to facilitate timely staff actions 
and facilities responses. At 
AECOM, we have an Operational 
Safeguard (Security) Plan as a 
baseline document with a view 
of site protection and associated 
details including journey 
management, communications, 
medical response, disruptive event 
management and evacuation 
plans. It includes where you go, 
what to say, how to get help and 
how to respond — all focused on 
the security of our people and 
clients during an emergency.
Global Security and Resiliency leader Mark Niblett 
shares his thoughts to help every organization 
be agile and efficient when responding to a 
disruptive event. CHAPTER 1PREPARING FOR DISASTER 
IN A WORLD OF EXTREMES14 15DESCRIPTOR DESCRIPTOR
RESILIENT IN THE FACE 
OF A CYBER-ATTACK
Infrastructure failures, 
from poorly designed new 
construction to aging roadways, 
bridges and dams, are 
occurring at an accelerating 
rate. Persistent, increasingly 
disturbing security breaches are 
plundering the personal data of 
millions of people and assaulting 
the critical networks of 
governments, financial systems 
and private industry. 
We live in an era where our 
physical and digital worlds 
are rapidly converging. Our 
infrastructure is at constant risk 
from cyber-attacks and extreme 
weather change. And because 
our networks and systems are 
so thoroughly interconnected 
and interdependent, cities and 
communities need plans in place 
to ensure they are prepared 
to minimize the effects when 
disaster strikes.
What are three things an 
organization can do to ensure it 
is prepared to manage risks?
1. THINK HOLISTICALLY:  T o avoid 
a disjointed approach, you need 
an integrated risk management 
framework that anticipates, avoids 
and absorbs evolving threats. 
We developed a Converged 
Resilience  approach, which is a 
risk management framework that 
approaches cybersecurity and 
operational resilience through a 
holistic lens looking at a range 
of factors. This framework 
encompasses cyber, wireless and 
physical domains — identifying 
vulnerabilities and weaknesses 
within each domain, as well as 
aligning critical processes with 
technologies to ensure business 
continuity. We must look at how 
all of an organization’s systems 
function together.

2. LOOK BEYOND THE FENCE LINE: 
Protecting telecommunications, 
power supplies and utilities from 
high-end physical and cyber 
threats has become a shared 
responsibility. In the United 
States, AECOM has partnered 
with the Army Cyber Institute, 
the City of Houston in the state 
of T exas and the National Guard 
to exercise Houston’s ability 
to respond to a multi-sector 
physical and cyber-attack. The 
exercise, called Jack Voltaic 
2 (JV2) will run through 2018 
and bring together military, civil 
and commercial stakeholders 
to understand the challenges, 
mitigate the risks and plan for 
the “what if” scenarios. This 
ground-breaking work will 
catapult the City of Houston 
as a state and national leader 
in cyber incident response 
and provide other cities with 
a municipal-level response 
framework for how to prepare 
for cyber-attacks.3. UPSKILL FOR THE FUTURE:  
It is no longer sufficient for 
military forces and U.S. state 
National Guards to be highly 
trained in providing physical 
security alone. Supporting 
cities also require armed forces 
to build capability in providing 
cyber protection. Supporting 
this, AECOM has developed 
cybersecurity training which 
incorporates the skills required 
to protect cities in the cases of 
cyber and physical threat.

Climate change affects every corner of our planet. From oceans and deserts to small villages 
and vast cities, and to the people in those communities and the resources on which they 
depend, our changing world impacts everything and everyone.

new challenges and change the way we live, work and travel.18 19DESCRIPTOR
LEADERSHIP SPOTLIGHT:
CONNECTING OUR UNIQUE EXPERTISE TO 
TACKLE TOMORROW’S CHALLENGES
How do you fuel innovation? 
I call myself a “human router,” I 
connect subject matter 
experts inside and outside 
AECOM to transform ideas 
into reality. At AECOM, we are 
in a unique position to make 
great connections with the 
range of technical expertise 
that spans across the project 
life cycle of design, build, 
finance and operate.
While our organization has 
incredible depth of experience 
and capability, it is important to 
go beyond our own colleagues 
and learn from others. This 
underlines my belief that 
innovation is driven by 
collaboration. This exchange of 
ideas, research, and growing 
awareness of the unique urban 
challenges fuels our solutions 
and helps solve our clients’ 
most complex problems.How did we innovate to tackle 
tomorrow’s climate change?
In the aftermath of Hurricane 
Sandy, the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) enacted 
the Rebuild by Design (RBD) 
Competition in 2013 to promote 
development of innovative 
resilient projects. 
AECOM was chosen to work 
with the New Jersey 
Department of Environmental 
Protection to implement the 
RBD Meadowlands  project: a 
real-time iterative study in 
balancing social, environmental 
and community benefits while 
realizing flood risk mitigation 
and increased resilience for 
communities. 
We brought our fully-integrated 
team of engineers, urban 
planners, landscape architects, ecologists, environmental 
scientists, and economists to 
the table to help tackle the 
complexity of flood risks from 
both storm water and tidal 
surge. Through marrying these 
diverse groups, we developed 
multi-benefit, integrated flood 
protection solutions that 
improved public spaces, 
reduced impacts to the natural 
environment, and improved 
future resilience for social, 
environmental and economic 
systems. 
Through these robust 
solutions we are securing our 
future by developing leaders  
in resiliency.
Darcy Immerman, Senior Vice President, 
Resiliency, shares ways we can all work to

CHAPTER 2SEA LEVEL RISE KNOWS 
NO BOUNDARIES
When both rising sea levels 
and groundwater flooding 
are considered cumulatively, 
conventional shoreline defense 
strategies often fail to protect 
communities from flooding. 
Designing for urban resilience 
will require us to prioritize 
collaborative partnerships and 
break down siloes.
The stage for long-term climate 
protection must be set with 
near-term projects addressing 
pressing challenges facing 
existing communities.
Click here  to see reports from the field. One ABC idea, Tidal Cities, 
proposed floating whole urban 
neighborhoods in new saltwater 
lagoons (embracing the rising 
waters) and using excavated dirt 
to build landforms that protect 
these floating communities. 
Sea level rise knows no boundaries, 
so collaboration between 
jurisdictions, agencies, and 
communities is essential. Sharing 
goals and collaborating early in 
the planning process can deliver 
stronger, more resilient results.
Collaborative, working relationships 
with communities from project 
onset is essential to co-design 
locally-embraced solutions 
that build social and economic 
resilience.2017 RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
