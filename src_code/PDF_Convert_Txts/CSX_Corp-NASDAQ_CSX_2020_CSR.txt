2020 Environmental, 
Social and 
Governance Report 0104An Unwavering Commitment to ESG Excellence
CSX made great headway on our ESG performance 
in 2020. 
Through the adoption of new technology systems 
and operating practices, we increased our 
sustainability advantage over our competitors, 
setting records for fuel effi   ciency and exceeding 
our emissions-reduction targets. 
We continued to prioritize and lead the industry
in safety performance. Over the course of the year, 
CSX employees achieved a 10 percent reduction in 
the company’s personal injury rate. 
To best serve our customers and meet their needs, 
we made strategic investments in technology and 
infrastructure. These investments resulted in more 
effi   cient operations, a more seamless experience 
for customers and enhanced agility that enabled 
us to make real-time decisions across the network.
As part of our ongoing eff  orts to prioritize and 
celebrate diversity, equity and inclusion in our 
workforce, we convened a cross-functional social 
justice advisory roundtable that will guide our 
internal and external eff  orts around awareness, 
education, communication and action.
Additionally, our Pride in Service program 
expanded in 2020, leveraging our rail and 
intermodal business operations to support 
and give back to the fi  rst responders and frontline 
workers supporting communities across the country.
Thank You to Our Employees
Our employees have shown tremendous 
resilience over the past year. I am unbelievably 
proud of the way each and every employee has 
responded to the challenges thrown at them. 
CSX employees have come together to ensure safety across our business – for themselves, 
for their colleagues, for their families, for our 
customers and for the communities where 
we live, work and operate. 
Thank you for your unwavering commitment, 
patience and tenacity.
The Best is Yet to Come
While we have made great progress, there is more 
work to do. It is imperative that the railroad industry 
leads by example to mitigate the eff  ects of climate 
change and forge the way toward a low-carbon 
economy. Similarly, given our presence in some of 
the largest population centers in the nation, we 
have an ongoing responsibility to protect and serve 
the local communities in which we operate. 
At CSX, we are up for the challenge. 
Our leadership in freight rail hinges on our ability 
to conduct business in a sustainable way that 
does right by all of our stakeholders. We are ready 
to embark on the next phase of profi  table and 
sustainable growth by making CSX rail the ground 
transportation mode of choice. 
As we continue on our mission to be the best 
run railroad in North America, I know that the 
best is yet to come for CSX.

James M. Foote
Freight railroads are the backbone of the U.S. 
economy, off  ering critical transportation services 
to businesses and customers. Safe, reliable service 
became more important than ever to transport 
essential goods across the country in 2020. 
Remaining true to our core operating principles, 
CSX played a critical role in keeping America – and 
its economy – moving. Operating in Unprecedented Times
2020 was a year of undue tragedy and hardship 
for individuals, families and businesses. We were 
faced with both an extraordinary global health 
emergency and ongoing attacks on equality and 
basic human rights.
The health and safety of our employees, customers 
and communities were of utmost importance 
for CSX. We were able to respond quickly to the 
pandemic while mitigating business disruptions 
and keeping our unwavering commitment to 
sustainable operations. 
We also reaffi   rmed our commitment to social justice 
and racial equality – both within our organization 
and throughout our communities. Adding CSX’s 
voice to the side of anti-racism is not only our 
corporate obligation, but also an opportunity to 
strengthen our culture of inclusion. 
I am hopeful that we will continue making 
strides towards a safe, healthy, inclusive society. A Message From Our President

The  
Future of  
Freight
19 2022“CSX is positioned to lead 
the future of freight. We 
rose to a whole new set 
of challenges in 2020, 
leveraging our network 
differently than ever 
before. Our operating 
structure, flexibility, 
predictive analytics and 
constant evaluation of 
needs has set CSX up for 
a phenomenal growth 
and recovery story in 
2021 and beyond.”
 
Jamie Boychuk
Executive Vice President  
of Operations By increasing our train capacity and adding more distributed  
power (DP) locomotives, we were able to run longer trains with fewer 
employees. This was particularly important in 2020 given the need  
for social distancing and unexpected, prolonged health-related absences. 
Further, DP enabled improved service, fuel efficiency and safety  
benefits. CSX will continue investments to make more locomotives  
DP compatible to further expand usage.We pride ourselves on our ability to innovate  
while maintaining best-in-class safety performance, 
minimizing our environmental footprint, providing 
excellent service to our customers, and investing  
in our people and our communities. 
Our operating model is designed to maximize 
efficiencies, improve transit times, enhance  
reliability and eliminate waste. We take proactive 
measures to remove every extra mile and every 
extra asset that does not contribute to the quality 
and consistency of our transportation product.  
This has allowed us to open new terminals  
and grow existing terminals, shifting traffic and  
resources to best serve our customers.

technologies enable us to drive meaningful improvements across 
safety, customer experience, environmental efficiencies and  
employee engagement. While innovation sits with different lines of 
business, our Technology team is accountable for the implementation 
and delivery of numerous technological innovations.
Innovating for Safety:  
Doubling Down on Our Drone Program  
By more than tripling our drone fleet  
(from 40 to 150) in 2020, we were able  
to improve safety, optimize inventory 
processes, detect changes and provide 
mapping of our assets in real time. 
Innovating for Customer Experience: 
Rebuilding ShipCSX’s Interface Design  
and Efficiency  
We enable our customers to plan, ship, trace 
and pay for shipments quickly and with secure 
data through our ShipCSX platform. CSX 
initiated a multi-year effort to improve the 
platform, incorporating the latest innovations 
in interface design and efficiency to meet 
customer demand, utilize the most up-to-
date technological advances, integrate the 
corporate brand standards, and support 
scheduled railroading.  Innovating for Environmental Efficiencies: 
Introducing New XGate Functions  
In 2020, we introduced new features to our 
XGate system, which allow us to streamline 
work for the intermodal drivers thanks to a 
machine vision technology that expedites 
driver transaction time by automating the 
outbound validation. 
Innovating for Employee Engagement: 
Shifting to Virtual Collaboration  
Platforms and Cloud Strategies  
The widespread use of virtual collaboration 
as the primary form of work in 2020 
allowed employees to work remotely and 
stay connected during the pandemic. Our 
Technology team was able to roll this out in 
record time and enabled new ways of working

2628Our Goals and Progress 
In 2012, we introduced a set of environmental 
goals to achieve by the end of 2020. We 
worked diligently to advance our environmental 
sustainability priorities and proudly met all of 
these goals, some years ahead of schedule. 
Additionally, in 2020, just six years into our  
15-year GHG emissions intensity target as 
approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative 
(SBTi), we achieved 34 percent of our 37.3 
percent reduction target. A more detailed 
overview of our performance against these  
goals can be found in the Environment  section  
of this report.
While we have made great progress, there 
is more work to do. Our ESG team has been 
engaging with cross-functional leaders across 
CSX departments to evaluate ESG-related 
programs and opportunities. As a result, we  
have established a new set of environmental 
goals that will guide our strategy in the coming 
years. The team is actively working to develop  
a robust set of social and governance goals.  
We will provide an update on these efforts in  
our 2021 ESG Report. 
2020 Environmental,

Performance, Progress & Goals 
27    Goal:  Reduce GHG emissions intensity by 6-8% 
Progress:  This goal was achieved in 2018.  
In 2020, we continued making progress  
by reducing GHG emissions intensity by  
13.8% since 2014,   
in line with our planned reduction trajectory  
to achieve our science-based target.      Goal:  Reduce hazardous waste

There have been significant lighting retrofits 
in car shops, office buildings and throughout 
railyards – improving the quality of light and 
reducing the energy required.  
    Goal:  Encourage employees to take  
sustainable actions in their everyday jobs,  
such as conserving energy, reducing waste  
and identifying efficiencies
Progress:  As part of our transformation,  
we have reduced the footprint and number of 
buildings where we operate, while continuing  
to identify ways to create new efficiencies.
    Goal:  Reduce quantity of water consumed
Progress:  We successfully  
reduced our water consumption by  
73%.
    Goal:  Improve the quality of effluent water
Progress:  We reduced the number  
of environmental deviations pertinent

60%   since setting goals in 2012.      Goal:  Increase energy blend to 10%  
renewable sources
Progress:  We purchased  
46,000  
Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)  
in 2020, or 10% of our Scope 2 emissions.  
We continue to investigate multiple  
avenues for increasing our renewable  
portfolio in the future.  GHG EmissionsWasteSustainable

Environmental Goals: 
02Reduce the amount 
of hazardous waste 
generated from  
ongoing operations  
by 30%.  
  To achieve this goal, we will re-evaluate  
our purchasing practices, provide training  
to project managers and utilize product  
recycling wherever possible.  
 
Decrease the amount 
of ongoing operations 
waste disposed in a 
landfill to less than 10% 
of volume.  
To achieve this goal, we will identify those  
waste streams that can be reused or recycled 
and expand use of these alternative means  
of disposal. 
Expand efforts to 
engage our supply  
chain through 
evaluation of GHG 
quantification, ESG 
goals, and evaluation of 
risks and opportunities 
by engaging our 
suppliers through CDP 
Supply Chain.   
To achieve this goal, we will partner with 
suppliers to create efficiencies and positively 
impact our businesses, our stakeholders and  
the environment.

Impact &  
Response
31 3234Our CSX Coronavirus Prevention and Response 
Policy provided all CSX employees, contractors, 
suppliers and visitors with guidance on business 
travel restrictions and facility access to enable 
our employees and business-critical staff to 
continue doing their jobs with lower risk of 
potential exposure. We also shifted our approach 
to employee well-being given the increase in 
remote work, introducing extended support  
and care through virtual settings to meet 
employee needs and ensure their overall  
health and wellness.
Adapting to Serve Our Customers
Like many companies across countless 
industries, CSX saw a historic dip in volume 
starting in March 2020. By introducing new  
ways of working, new technologies and new 
platforms to communicate with customers, 
we were able to adapt and recover as soon as 
customer demand returned. 
As a company that provides critical infrastructure 
services to our nation, it was essential that CSX 
maintain access to customers and facilities 
across our network. Agility, flexibility and 
continued engagement with our customers 
through digital communications platforms 
have been key to our ability to quickly pivot to 
meet our customers’ needs. Additionally, with 
much of the nation shut down and states across 
our footprint introducing varying degrees of 
restrictions, CSX equipped our employees and 
contractors with Access Letters to assist them 
in reporting to our workplaces and to ensure 
continuity in serving our customers.

33Supporting Our Communities
In keeping with our commitment to serving our 
communities, CSX looked for opportunities to 
redeploy our efforts to meet the critical needs 
of our nation the best we could. We utilized our 
intermodal business to move essential supplies 
and gifts of gratitude for frontline workers, and 
we pivoted our Pride in Service funding and 
focus to best support our NGO partners’ greatest 
emerging needs. This shift enabled us to support 
the communities and individuals most impacted 
by COVID-19, particularly law enforcement, 
firefighters and other frontline healthcare 
workers and EMTs.Our existing continuity plans for business 
disruptions provided valuable insights for our 
safety, wellness and execution strategies, 
allowing us to move quickly at the start of the 
pandemic to address operations logistics and 
meet evolving needs across all aspects of our 
supply chain. 
As a result of our flexibility and the use of 
predictive analytics, we were able to pivot  
quickly in an era of uncertainty, scaling down 
operations as volumes dipped and restoring 
operations based on which corridors we 
anticipated would recover first and when.  
We continue to monitor the situation and adapt 
our policies and procedures accordingly.
Keeping Our Employees Safe
We took preventive measures to safeguard  
our people and operations, providing important 
resources and timely updates as we monitored 
the global spread of the coronavirus. One of 
the most important steps was to safeguard 
an adequate supply of Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) and cleaning supplies  
at all CSX locations where in-person work  
was essential.
Another imperative was ensuring our employees 
were well-informed and had up-to-date 
information and resources at their fingertips 
through our CSX Gateway intranet site, including 
those issued by the CDC and those specific to 
CSX and our operations. No country, business 
or individual was truly  
prepared for what  
2020 would bring.  
 
At CSX, our priorities  
were to protect our 
employees and their  
families, continue serving  
our customers, and do  
what we could to ensure  
the safety and security of  
our local communities.“Never has employee 
health and well-being 
been more vital to CSX’s 
mission than during the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Our people and our 
company stepped up to 
the challenge to keep 
each other safe and our 
economy moving.”

Surfacing 4,543 miles 4,712 miles 4,408 miles 4,098 milesAt CSX, safety encompasses every aspect of our operations 
– all employees across the organization are part of the Safety 
team, and every meeting, regardless of purpose, starts with a 
safety briefing. By putting health and safety at the center of 
our day-to-day operations, we strive to foster a safety culture 
grounded in ownership and accountability. 
We take a proactive, network approach to safety, 
whereby we aim to identify and eliminate as many 
factors as possible that may contribute to the 
occurrence of accidents, and then share learnings 
and best practices across the organization. Our 
Chief Safety Officer is responsible for overseeing 
our safety strategy. We also work diligently to 
increase regional-level leadership engagement 
and involvement in CSX’s system-wide safety plan 
through our Executive Safety Council. To underscore 
the critical importance of deepening our focus on 
injury and accident prevention, safety metrics  
such as FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index and 
Train Accident Rate are part of our Management 
Incentive Compensation Plan (MICP). 
We track safety performance daily through our 
Public Safety, Health and Environment (PSH&E) 
Management System, which is regularly updated 
under the requirements of the American Chemistry 
Council’s Responsible Care Management System  and informed by ISO 14001. We conduct 
regular trainings and have robust emergency 
preparedness practices. Further, to ensure the 
safety of our physical and operational assets, every 
year we conduct a comprehensive industry risk 
assessment, in partnership with the AAR. 
We recognize that safety is an ongoing journey, 
and customer collaboration and technology 
investments are essential to optimize both  
service and safety performance. As such, we 
continue to invest in technological innovations  
that can detect and avoid many types of human 
factor incidents to serve as an additional layer  
of protection for our employees.

Frequency Index 1
FRA Train Accident Rate 2The COVID-19 crisis has had a profound impact on 
our daily lives and the way we conduct business, 
including how we approach safety. Travel restrictions, 
for example, prevented us from spending time in 
the field and conducting our routine safety audits, 
and in some areas, we also experienced a shortage 
of workers due to unexpected, prolonged absences, 
which required us to rethink how teams performed 
core safety activities with fewer employees.
Despite the unprecedented nature of these impacts, 
CSX leadership and employees rose to the challenge, 
adapting our safety approach in response:  
• W e added new policies and procedures to
safeguard the health and safety of our employees,
and a cross-functional task force continues to
monitor the situation to ensure that appropriate
safety measures are being taken.
• Our  Executive Safety Councils continued to
meet on an ongoing basis and have meaningfuldialogues in a virtual format.
• W e issued more than 3,400 tablets in 2020 to
train and engine employees to digitize requiredoperational documents while allowing for social
distancing. This is an area of growth for the future
which was positively welcomed by employees.
CSX will continue delivering additional tablet
functionality on an ongoing basis to enhance
safety, drive efficiencies and modernize work tools.In the near term, this includes capturing when a train and engine employee performs railcar 
activities in real-time, including setouts, repairs 
and brake tests. 
In 2020, we performed four system-wide audits 
to ensure compliance with operational testing 
requirements, in addition to field audits conducted 
by each field region. Results were compared to 
normal operational testing and safety incidents and 
allowed us to discuss and identify opportunities to 
make improvements and uncover any gaps, such 
as low failure rates, high incident rates and spikes 
in noncompliance compared to daily testing rates.   
From a performance standpoint, 2020 saw a new 
record low for the second consecutive year in the 
number of FRA reportable injuries. The number 
of FRA reportable train accidents remained low; 
however, we did see an increase in our FRA train 
accident rate based on our reduction in train miles. 
Despite our progress and ongoing commitment  
to become an injury-free railroad, in 2020 two CSX 
employees tragically lost their lives on our rail lines 
as a result of two separate incidents. Both were thoroughly investigated to ensure we could identify 
the cause and make any subsequent changes to 
our safety rules and procedures. 
We remain steadfast in our commitment  
to become an injury-free railroad by continuing 
to improve our safety practices and encouraging 
safe behaviors to avoid any and all preventable 
accidents.1 FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index calculated as 
cases/200,000 employee hours. Safety statistics are 
estimated and continue to be updated as actuals settle.
2 FRA Train Accident Rate tracks FRA reportable train 
accidents per million train miles. Safety statistics are estimated and continue to be updated as actuals settle.A Proactive Safety Approach
In 2020, we introduced several new  
trainings and programs to continue evolving 
to a proactive, risk-based safety approach: 
 New Frontline Training Program:   
Geared toward new frontline supervisors in 
transportation, our new training program aims  
to create better frontline leaders to advance  
safety practices. As part of the program,  
supervisors come into CSX’s Training Center where 
they receive specialized training before moving to 
their field locations to observe and get to know the 
territory. In Q4 of 2020, our first class of  frontline 
employees completed this training, and we  
have plans to conduct three more sessions  
during the first six months of 2021. 
Voice in Safety:   
This new initiative was designed to create a system 
where employees can easily report hazardous 
working conditions, including near accidents that 
would not normally be captured. Employees can anonymously report by filling out a form on CSX’s 
internal employee Gateway, leaving a voicemail at a 
1-800 number or sending an email to a designated 
CSX inbox. We also plan to develop a feature within 
CSX’s Railz application that will allow conductors 
to report these alerts in real time at a specific GPS 
location.  
Joint Labor and Management Safety T ours:   
This initiative consists of local management and union representatives going out in the field together to analyze rail conditions and discuss any potential 
issues and opportunities to make improvements. 
This allows field employees, and specifically 
conductors, to proactively flag concerns before  
they turn into actual issues. 20170.801.00

02Physical Protection and Security
Our ability to provide safe, reliable, essential 
transportation services to businesses and  
customers across the country has become more 
important than ever. Therefore, the security of  
our trains and infrastructure is among our top 
priorities as we work to safeguard our employees,  
the communities where we operate and the  
goods that we transport for our customers. 
The CSX Infrastructure Protection team is 
responsible for the implementation of safety  
and security measures to protect our network’s 
critical assets, including rails, yards, bridges and 
tunnels, as well as fuel centers, aviation divisions
and corporate buildings. 
In partnership with local and state law  
enforcement, the CSX Police Department is  
tasked with maintaining railroad security and 
integrity by protecting our personnel, critical 
infrastructure, property, and the public against 
criminal acts and the threat of terrorism.  Assessment T esting
Regular assessment testing ensures we can  
identify and investigate potential accidents and 
injuries before they occur. 
We continue to engage and partner with  
agencies including the FRA and TSA on intel 
sharing and risk assessment processes annually. 
Each year, we participate in a comprehensive 
Threat Risk Assessment, in collaboration with 
the AAR. In 2020, we also conducted an internal 
risk assessment in response to the latest rules by 
Canada’s Occupational Health and Safety.

02T ools and T echnologies
Technology is embedded in every aspect of modern 
railroading. Now more than ever, CSX is leveraging 
innovative tools and technology solutions to increase 
service agility, reliability and most importantly, 
safety. Some of the cutting-edge technologies we 
use to optimize performance include the following:
       Positive Train Control  
Positive Train Control (PTC) is a nationwide 
system that is designed to prevent train-to-train 
collisions, derailments and other accidents. In 
line with a regulatory mandate set by Congress, 
in 2020 CSX achieved 100 percent PTC 
interoperability across our network, enforcing 
speed and signal compliance to ensure the safety 
of our rails and communities where we operate. 
        Drones  
Following the successful launch of our drone 
program in 2019, we increased deployment 
from 40 to 150 drones in 2020, with the goal of 
enhancing federally mandated operational testing 
and observations.  
 
We also leveraged technology to improve both the 
safety and efficiency of our operational testing 
procedures. This technology allows us to obtain 
high-resolution photos in areas that are difficult 
for inspectors to access, eliminating the need for 
field personnel to navigate through tough terrain.        Autonomous Track Assessment Cars  
In March 2020, our autonomous track 
assessment car (ATAC) pilot program was 
approved by the FRA. ATACs, which automate 
issue detection and significantly reduce train 
accidents, now cover 19.6 percent of our core 
main line track miles, totaling 3,081 miles of 
coverage. 
        Asset Monitoring and  
Detection T echnology  
We leverage various technologies to monitor 
access to our properties and assets, including 
the Security Countermeasure System (SCMS), 
which can be used to raise security alerts 
to CSX management, and the Crisis Alert 
Response System (CARS), which measures  
and assesses environmental risks. We also 
leverage the MIR3 communication platform  
to communicate with employees in real-time  
in case of emergency.  
 
In 2020, we consolidated our access control 
system into a one badge system and upgraded 
our camera service at our headquarters. These 
updates allow us to consolidate our cameras 
into one platform while conducting operational 
testing and reviews right from headquarters.   
 
Moving forward, we will continue to advance 
this initiative and other infrastructure projects 
that promote safety, such as adding more 
badge access to remote locations and installing 
fencing cameras where we can give more 
visibility in operations and extra safety features 
layered in. Train Inspection Portal  
CSX’s first two Train Inspection Portal (TIP)  
sites came into operation in 2020. These 
automated systems produce 360-degree scans 
of railcars passing through the portals at track 
speed. Each site images roughly 20 or more 
trains per day, using advanced machine vision 
technology and software algorithms to identify 
defects – such as missing bolts, unsecured  
boxcar doors and open hatches underneath a 
railcar – and automatically flag cars that need 
repair. We plan to open a third TIP site near 
Savannah, Georgia, in 2021.

02Hazard Management and  
Emergency Preparedness
When it comes to transporting hazardous materials, 
safety is always our top priority. Every decision we 
make is intended to move the freight from origin to 
destination without incident. To do that, we work 
closely with our employees, customers, regulators 
and suppliers to deliver these products safely and 
reliably. 
We adopt a 3R approach (i.e., recognize, record 
and report) to hazardous materials transportation, 
which includes comprehensive guidelines, trainings 
and protocols.  7,115 CSX employees completed our 
annual hazardous materials training in 2020.
Our 3R training programs also extend to CSX 
contractors. Roughly 80 percent of our contractors 
completed the training in 2020, and outreach was 
made to the remaining contractors to complete the 
training.
More information, including our commitment 
to increase public transparency around the safe 
movement of hazardous materials across our 
23-state network as well as materials’ classification 
and regulation, can be found on our Hazardous 
Materials webpage.First Responder Engagement
Our CSX Public Safety Coordination Center 
(PSCC) is a central communications hub helping 
coordinate first responders and dispatchers 
around the clock. PSCC manages reports of 
railroad incidents such as blocked crossings, 
crossing collisions, signal malfunctions, materials 
released, theft, vandalism or trespassing to ensure 
all issues are promptly resolved.
In addition to ongoing communication and 
coordination, CSX offers necessary trainings 
to provide first responders with the necessary 
information, experience and coordination of 
resources to respond effectively in an incident 
or emergency. To continue these efforts in 2020 
with local first responders and communities 
across the network, CSX adapted the Safety Train 
Classroom from a traveling classroom railcar to a 
predominantly virtual training format. Leveraging 
a combination of virtual and hands-on training, we 
successfully trained 3,600 first responders over 
the course of the year. Building on this momentum, 
we plan to introduce a newly-constructed 
Responder Incident Training (RIT) railcar in mid-
2021 which will travel the CSX system to provide 
interactive first responder training. Customer Collaboration
Partnering with customers to preserve rail 
equipment is a key tenet of CSX’s safety 
approach. We offer dedicated Safety and 
Security resources on our Customer website , 
such as information on federal regulations and 
CSX policies for shipping hazardous materials  
by rail, training and education and programs  
and initiatives. Additionally, our Safety team 
engages with customers on a regular basis 
through direct outreach.  
Community Safety
The vast majority of railroad fatalities and 
injuries (namely 95 percent, as reported by the 
FRA) are due to highway-rail grade crossing 
collisions and pedestrian trespass on tracks. 
Given the preventable nature of these incidents, 
public awareness plays a key role in maintaining 
community rail safety. 
To prevent these types of accidents, we are 
working hard to educate the public and reach as 
many people as possible with information that 
encourages safe behavior near railroad tracks. 
As part of this effort, our community safety 
programs bring together safety initiatives 
and the people and communities we serve. 
We have a longstanding partnership with 
Operation Lifesaver , a nonprofit organization 
and nationally recognized leader of rail safety 
education, to promote free rail safety education 
and specialized training for various stakeholder 
groups, including law enforcement officers and 
first responders.CSX Honors 72 Customers  
with 26th Annual Chemical 
Safety Excellence Awards
Partnering with  
Operation Lifesaver to 
Increase Public SafetyIn 2020, CSX recognized 72 customers with  
our annual Chemical Safety Excellence Award for 
their commitment to the safe transportation of 
hazardous materials. Representing a wide range of 
industry segments, including chemicals, biofuels, 
waste and fertilizers, these customers shipped a 
combined 218,000 carloads of hazardous materials 
on the CSX network in 2019 without a release due  
to controllable factors. 
To learn more about the award and the award 
winners, please visit our website.
In 2020, we teamed up with Operation Lifesaver 
for the fourth annual Rail Safety Week, held on 
September 21-27, 2020.  While our annual network-
wide outreach usually includes activities such as 
trespassing and traffic enforcement blitzes, school 
and community presentations, and truck driver 
outreach, this year, the initiative pivoted from 
in-person programming to a public awareness 
campaign on social media to raise awareness of  
safe behaviors around trains and railroad tracks.  
As a result of this online engagement, Operation 
Lifesaver had 42 million social media impressions 
and 216,000 new website users.

As of 2020, more than  
3,300 customers in over 
6,000 locations depend 
on CSX for transportation 
solutions that are reliable, 
efficient and sustainable.
 
Every CSX employee, whether customer-  
facing or not, is responsible for delivering  
our industry-leading customer service. 
Our Sales and Marketing teams work closely  
with customers to ensure continuous 
communication and address feedback,  
while also working alongside Operations  
and other business units to escalate  
comments and implement solutions. 
We stand firm in our commitment to 
upholding high standards of customer  
service. Even in challenging times, we 
embraced opportunities to innovate and 
evolve products, and ultimately offer 
customers a higher level of reliability, 
predictability and transparency.Keeping Supply Chains Moving
This past year underscored the importance of 
efficient and reliable rail service for keeping 
supply chains fluid despite widespread economic 
uncertainty. As the pandemic was unfolding, CSX 
regularly monitored the situation and made the 
necessary changes to safely continue providing 
unmatched customer service.  
To transparently communicate with employees, 
contractors, suppliers and visitors, we issued the 
Coronavirus Prevention and Response Policy , 
intentionally designed with flexible response 
capabilities to ensure we could monitor and 
promptly respond to unexpected changes 
caused by the pandemic. These efforts were 
overseen by the CSX Pandemic Response Task 
Force which provided regular review of CSX 
protocols, case levels and regional response 
measures to ensure the effectiveness of CSX’s 
policies. The team also utilized weekly newsletter 
updates and town hall meetings to share the 
precautionary steps underway to safeguard 
operations and continue meeting stakeholder 
needs.
Building on existing continuity plans for business 
disruptions, CSX was able to quickly adjust 
operations in reaction to a sharp downturn in 
volume. These efforts were tailored to address 
safety, wellness and execution strategies 
that focused on the health of employees and 
included backup facilities where business-critical 
functions could swiftly transition to continue 
seamless train operations. Even as supply and 
demand levels changed drastically – first in response to limited supply and then spiking  
as the economy reopened – our operating  
model proved to be adaptive and nimble, 
ultimately helping us respond to rapid changes  
in traffic volumes. 
In an effort to sustain operational efficiencies  
and uphold excellence in the customer 
experience, we chose to allocate resources when 
and where they were needed most. Our efforts  
to accommodate changes in priorities resulted 
in a delayed opening of the Carolina Connector, 
now tracking for completion mid-2021. “At CSX, we know 
what truly counts  is 
our customers knowing 
they can count on us . 
That’s what fuels our 
perseverance during 
challenging times like 
COVID-19: our unyielding 
commitment to safety, 
reliability and first-class 
customer service.”

02Best-in-Class Customer Service
Our operating model enables us to deliver  
best-in-class service and to serve as a reliable supply 
chain partner to customers. In 2020, this included 
several efforts to streamline supply chains, create 
more efficient modes of delivery and expand these 
improvements across our network.  
For instance, XGate  – a revolutionary new system 
that not only accelerates the pace of customer 
deliveries, but also reduces potential emissions at 
intermodal terminals by up to 90 percent – now 
makes up 85 percent of gate transactions. We 
have rolled out the ability to use XGate at all CSX 
Intermodal facilities, so all CSX customers can 
benefit from optimized flow across terminals, 
while saving time and resources and reducing air 
emissions. With more than 40,000 registered drivers 
now leveraging the system, we enhanced the XGate 
app in 2020 based on customer and driver feedback 
to offer significantly more flexibility.
Additionally, the Intermodal T erminal Reservation 
System , which allows customers the ability to  
make gate reservations, helped maintain terminal 
fluidity. 2020 was the first full year of system 
reservations, also lending peace of mind to 
customers needing to transport critical shipments 
during uncertain times, while preventing terminals 
from becoming congested.Providing excellent customer service means 
investing in technologies that provide added 
value and efficiencies to customers. This includes 
investing in low-carbon operational improvements 
that help customers reduce their transportation 
footprint, such as DP. This technology distributes 
locomotive power at intermediate points 
throughout the train, ultimately reducing fuel 
consumption.
These are just a few examples of the technologies 
and operational practices we’re investing in to 
drive maximum achievable efficiencies for our 
customers. Even in times of unprecedented 
uncertainty and cross-industry disruption, these 
innovations keep operations on track and the 
customer experience seamless. Train Velocity  (Miles per Hour)

Trip Plan Performance measures success  
meeting end-to-end customer commitments  
based on a specific time of arrival.Train velocity is defined as the average train  
speed between origin and destination in miles per 
hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains 
or passenger trains). Train velocity measures the 
profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival 
and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically 
updated to align with a changing operation.Dwell refers to the average amount of time in hours 
between car arrival to and departure from the yard.
Gross Ton-Miles (GTMs) refer to the movement of one 
ton of train weight over one mile. GTMs are calculated 
by multiplying total train weight by distance the train 
moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of 
the freight cars and their contents.

02Innovations Driving the  
Customer Experience
We continue to use and invest in innovative 
technologies that streamline supply chains and 
create more efficient modes of communication.  
This provides the best possible experience for  
our customers, while offering them more 
transparency and peace of mind around the  
status of their deliveries.
For instance, our ShipCSX  platform allows  
customers to plan, ship, trace and pay for shipments 
quickly and securely while streamlining terminals 
so shipments can arrive efficiently. In 2020, 
we embarked on a multi-year effort to rebuild 
the ShipCSX.com website to enhance the user 
experience and upgrade the platform. In addition  
to reflecting the latest innovations in interface 
design, ShipCSX has an updated platform that will 
include enhancements so it can better support 
scheduled railroading.  
CSX continued building out an Enterprise Events 
platform, a digital hub for event streaming, and  
data processing for improved visibility, planning  
and analytics. The platform will provide visibility 
around real-time events, enable safer operations  
and increased efficiencies through real-time 
tracking and analysis of sensor data, and enhance 
the customer experience through improved quality, 
timeliness and frequency of reporting. To further integrate our in-house customer service 
tools and capabilities, we transitioned CSX’s CRM 
capabilities to Salesforce. Investing in cloud-based 
technology allows our Customer Solutions team  
to create efficiencies, reduce time on manual tasks 
and implement new ways for the Service and  
Sales teams to interact and collaborate at the 
customer account level, all of which strengthen  
the customer experience. 
To better work directly with our customers and 
answer their questions, we implemented the  
Pega Co-Browse solution that gives our Customer 
Engagement team the ability to screen share and 
assist ShipCSX users in real-time. We look forward 
to building off of this initial success and looking for 
new ways to apply this technology moving forward.

Continuous Customer Engagement 
Our Sales, Marketing and Customer Engagement 
teams partner with our Operations team to ensure 
an excellent customer experience. Whether problem-
solving on the fly or working to implement a phased 
solution, we work in lockstep with our customers to 
sustain their trust, gather feedback and ultimately 
ensure we are bringing viable solutions to address 
their needs.
It is imperative to keep open lines of communication 
with our customers to best address their needs 
as they arise. Our existing communications 
infrastructure made this possible as the pandemic 
unfolded. In response to a spike in inquiries via phone 
and website, we developed a proactive messaging 
strategy around issues, questions and areas in the 
network that were common themes in customer 
inquiries. For example, for our merchandise single 
car business, we implemented a process to provide 
supplemental proactive updates on traffic levels  
and any foreseen delays across regions.
Our process for evaluating new tools and 
improvements includes engaging customers early 
in the process to gauge their feedback. To continue 
doing this in 2020 in lieu of having traditional  
face-to-face conversations, we implemented a  
digital process that enabled our Customer Service 
team to maintain customer relationships and  
gather feedback in new ways, such as 
adopting Zoom and Microsoft Teams as virtual 
communications platforms.  As a result, usage of Teams – which had been 
rolled out previously in 2019 but expanded to Union 
employees in 2020 – greatly increased, along with 
the volume of cross-channel communications as a 
whole, as shown by the snapshot to the right. 
To further provide product support, ShipCSX 
trainings were converted to a 100 percent virtual 
format, enabling our Customer Solutions team  
to quickly respond to inquiries by directing 
customers to specific modules and offering 
additional post-training support, as needed. 
Additionally, we have streamlined the  
annual customer survey to increase customer 
engagement and response rates by providing 
seamless integration with the new Salesforce  
tool. This feedback allows us to adjust our 
Customer Engagement strategy to best meet 
customer needs. Increase in Cross-Channel Communications

Bringing our customer engagement forum online
 
Prior to 2020, customer engagement forums were held twice a year, bringing together customers and  
CSX leaders for constructive discussions about customers’ business needs and how CSX can meet them. 
For our September 2020 event, we transitioned to an entirely virtual format, with 150 customers joining us 
for a day of dialogue surrounding the pandemic’s impact across industries and plans for the year ahead.

Operations Support 
The CSX Operations team works hand-in-hand 
with our Customer Solutions team to ensure 
customer feedback is promptly addressed 
and reviewed, as needed, at the corporate 
and fi  eld levels. 
Daily network operations meetings provide a 
forum for ongoing discussions around customer 
feedback. These meetings became all the more 
critical in 2020 and were increased to twice daily 
during the most crucial times during the 
pandemic to ensure constant action against 
the most pressing customer feedback. 
Additionally, customer issues are shared 
between the Operations and Customer Solutions 
teams via daily impact reports. These refl  ect 
the top 15-20 most relevant priorities to 
ensure immediate attention is being given 
to the issues that need it so swift action 
can be taken.“As a company, our goal is to 
deliver world-class customer 
experiences, and we are 
proud of our long-standing 
partnership with CSX. Thanks 
to CSX’s reliable and effi   cient 
service, we’re able to deliver 
for our customers. The 
environmental effi   ciencies 
off  ered by railroads – and 
CSX – also enable us to 
advance our sustainability 
agenda. The company’s 
recognition in CDP’s A-list 
is a testament to their 
leadership in climate action 
and transparency.”“For 30 years, T oyota and 
CSX have worked together 
in a shared dedication to 
continuous improvement and 
collaboration. As the recipient 
of our President’s Award 
for Logistics Excellence, 
CSX embodies outstanding 
partnership when it comes 
to delivering top-notch 
service and reliability with 
their unwavering pursuit of 
customer excellence across 
safety, quality, problem-
solving and the environment, 
even in the most diffi   cult 
of times.”

continue to provide 
service that rivals trucks 
for speed and reliability, 
we’re working intensely 
with customers to deliver 
supply chain solutions

conversions benefi  t the 
environment by lowering 
emissions and benefi  t 
communities by reducing 
congestion on their

Partnering for Sustainable Growth 
We are dedicated to continually improving service 
for existing customers as well as identifying new 
opportunities that enable growth and innovation 
across our network, while keeping sustainability top 
of mind. We continue to make progress on these 
initiatives including:
       TRANSFLO:    
CSX TRANSFLO helps customers take advantage 
of the economic and environmental benefits 
of rail without having rail infrastructure at their 
facility. At each of the 40-plus TRANSFLO 
transloading terminals, bulk products are safely 
transferred between railcars and trucks, giving 
customers flexibility to access new markets and 
suppliers. TRANSFLO has experience with more 
than 300 different products, including chemicals, 
crude oil, dry bulk, ethanol, food–grade products, 
plastics and waste materials.  
       Carolina Connector (CCX):   
CSX is expanding into eastern North Carolina  
with the construction of a new intermodal 
terminal in Rocky Mount. Strategically located 
on the CSX network and near the major 
consumption market in the Triangle Region, the 
Carolina Connector terminal will provide regional 
industries with convenient rail access, helping 
connect products to consumers nationwide.  
The project—which was temporarily paused 
due to COVID-19— is now tracking towards 
completion in the second half of 2021.       Northwest Ohio Investments:   
The CSX Transportation-served Northwest 
Ohio intermodal terminal is one of North 
America’s most technologically advanced and 
environmentally friendly terminals. With seven 
wide-span electric cranes, track infrastructure 
and technology that minimizes idle truck time, 
this automated and highly efficient terminal 
operates across 500 acres. Strategically located 
between Chicago and the Northeast mainlines, 
the terminal is three miles off I-75, enabling 
convenient truck access to local and regional 
markets from Chicago to Pittsburgh and  
Detroit to Cincinnati. 
       Chicago T erminal Enhancements:   
Building on the successes of previous 
Intermodal terminal designs, CSX is working  
to enhance our two Chicago terminals. The 
project will ultimately create two dedicated 
terminals, the 59th Street terminal for the 
majority of our international business and 
the Bedford Park terminal for our domestic 
business. In addition to optimizing flows and 
creating additional capacity at both locations, 
these enhancements will ensure the terminals 
are designed with long-term connectivity in 
mind for our customers.

Fostering Local Economic Opportunity
As a network spanning 23 states, we recognize  
the opportunity to drive positive impact beyond  
the rails and in the communities we connect. 
Through our community investments and 
infrastructure capital expenditures, CSX proudly 
contributes to local-level economic growth  
that helps build stronger communities across  
our value chain. Our Rail to Trails initiative  
allows us to bring a new slate  
of customers to CSX while  
having a positive outcome for  
our local communities. We work 
with local municipalities to  
convert former rail corridors  
into recreational trails, including 
recent collaborations across:
Athens, TN | 11 acres:  
In February 2020, we sold the land which will be 
constructed into a trailhead, a project overseen by 
the City of Athens.  
Flint, MI | 43 acres:  
In December 2020, roughly four miles of an 
abandoned corridor were sold to the city of  
Flint, MI, to be transformed for recreational trail.  
Sudbury, MA | 11 acres:  
In December 2020, the Town of Sudbury, MA, 
purchased 1.4 miles of railroad which will be 
developed as part of a larger trail project.

With nearly 19,300  
employees throughout the 
United States, our people  
are our greatest strength.
We are proud to employ a cohesive network of 
individuals who share our commitment to be 
the best-run railroad in North America. We strive 
to foster a collaborative culture that allows our 
employees to bring the best of themselves to CSX 
each day and to offer rewarding career opportunities 
and recognition programs that can support our 
employees’ ongoing learning and development. 
To ensure these values are reflected, our Board of 
Directors’ Compensation and Talent Management 
Committee oversees executive compensation and 
human capital management, including leadership 
development, performance management, talent 
acquisition programs and our plans for promoting 
diversity, inclusion and pay equity.
We continue to prioritize a focus on talent that 
supports CSX’s business objectives. Our dedicated 
human resources professionals ensure the programs 
and processes drive results across workforce 
management, talent management and development, 
employee relations, diversity, equity and inclusion, 
compensation, benefits and well-being.  Our Total Rewards packages are designed  
to support employee recruitment and retention,  
while also moving forward CSX’s business  
growth strategies. 
In 2021 and beyond, we are focusing on 
strengthening our culture to create an environment 
where employees work as one team, share values 
that differentiate us as an employer of choice and 
enable our entrepreneurial spirit. 
Our commitment to people extends beyond our 
employees and into our local communities. Service 
is at the heart of every decision we make, for our 
customers, for ourselves and for our communities. 
We serve the communities in which we live and 
operate through monetary and in-kind giving, as 
well as employee volunteerism opportunities.

02Prioritizing Employee Health  
and Well-being  
We understand that there is not a “one size fits all” 
approach to health and well-being. As such, we 
are committed to helping our employees through 
tailored tools, resources and support programs to 
meet their individual needs. 
Like many companies around the world, we had  
to reevaluate our approach in 2020 to safeguard  
the health and well-being of our employees. As a 
result, we enhanced our four pillars of employee 
well-being – physical, emotional, social and financial 
support – to ensure everyone, at all stages and  
levels in their career, is able to receive assistance 
across the health and well-being spectrum. 
Highlights include:
        
•  Expanded virtual health and well-being  
services to meet employees where they are  
and cater to a dispersed workforce
       
       •  Rolled out the Accelerate Program, an internal 
social platform to recognize employees  
across the company with a note of thanks  
and appreciation on a job well done 
       •  Increased parental leave to 12 weeks for birth 
parents and 6 weeks for non-birth parents  
and adoptions for management employees       •  Recommitted our efforts around mental 
health and well-being resources and tools, 
including on-site employee assistance 
program (EAP) support, tele-medicine virtual 
visits and 24/7 access to a robust network  
of EAP counselors
To learn more about CSX benefits, visit our  
2021 Benefits Summary page . 
As an added layer of safety for our employees  
and the communities we serve, we implemented 
extra precautions for our Network Operations & 
Crew Management Centers for whom being in-
person is essential to getting work done, including 
on-site nurses, temperature screenings, COVID 
testing, PPE, frequent deep cleanings  
and reconfigured workspaces. 
Fostering a Diverse, Equitable  
and Inclusive Workplace
CSX believes strongly that we cannot be the 
best-run railroad in North America without  
the best people, and we cannot have the best 
people without embracing diversity, equity and  
inclusion in our workforce. In 2020, we launched 
our new social justice initiative with furthered 
commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion  
in the workplace – and across the nation.

Addressing Racial Injustice
CSX is committed to social justice in our 
communities. We developed a cross-functional  
social justice advisory roundtable of employees and 
leaders to strategize and execute a plan to combat 
racial injustice. In addition, we have deployed a  
wide-ranging action plan to help strengthen inclusion 
in our own corporate culture and within  
the communities we serve.
The internal plan is built on four pillars, each with 
specific items that will directly impact employees 
and improve our culture. These include:
      
       Awareness, Education and Communication:  
Sharing of diversity metrics and culture survey 
results; roundtable discussions; listening sessions 
and open dialogue; increased company match 
of employee contributions to organizations 
supporting racial equity; and distribution of 
enlightening videos and articles.
       Potential or Perceived Inequities:  
Modernizing job titles to remove terminology  
that may be offensive or have racial connotations; 
reiterating zero tolerance policies; establishing 
long-term targets and performance management; 
ensuring bias mitigation and pay equity; and 
acknowledging the role of Black employees in 
CSX history.       Employee Development : Enhancing 
professional development for mid-level 
managers; increasing mentoring opportunities, 
leadership coaching for people of color, and 
developing executive sponsors and leaders 
of business resource groups (BRGs); and 
sponsoring industry-related diversity resource 
groups.
       Voter Education : Increasing voting and 
awareness internally; communicating voting 
days and procedures across our territory; and 
encouraging voting on election days.
For the external portion of our social justice action 
plan, we partnered with the Congressional Black 
Caucus Foundation  (CBCF) and City Year  while 
also leveraging our Pride in Service community 
engagement initiative to support equity through 
our partnerships with military and first responder 
groups, with an emphasis on helping bridge the 
divide between segments of our communities 
and law enforcement. In 2020, we had the 
honor of serving as the title sponsor for many 
educational sessions at the 2020 CBCF, including 
in-depth focuses on African-American Veterans; 
science and technology; Black voting rights; and 
small businesses. Additionally, CSX’s 25-year 
sponsorship of City Year helps keep students in 
school and on track to graduate in underserved 
communities. 
Social justice is essential for expanding economic 
prosperity to all people, in all communities. We are 
a stronger country — and a stronger company — 
when all of us are able to contribute the full extent 
of our abilities.Diversity and Inclusion
While work remains to be done, we are proud  
of the strides that CSX has made toward  
building a diverse organization that celebrates 
different backgrounds and experiences.  
With support from our leaders, we maintain  
our focus on working collaboratively with  
our employees, communities and partners  
to create a diverse and inclusive workplace.  
The diversity in our leadership team increased 
from 26 percent in 2019 to 32 percent in 2020. 
We are also proud of our achievement in  
being recognized as one of the “Best Places  
to Work for Disability Inclusion” by Disability:IN  
for the third consecutive year. “At CSX, our top priority 
is the safety of our 
workforce and the 
communities we operate 
in and serve. We are 
committed to keeping 
a safe and inclusive 
environment on-site at  
all times.”

02Veterans and Military at CSX
Service is core to who we are. More than 3,100 
veterans, active-duty military and first responders 
work at CSX, accounting for 16 percent of our total 
workforce. We advanced our efforts to recruit and 
hire military veterans in 2020, including through our 
partnership with Wounded Warrior Project  (WWP). 
In 2020, we hosted a webinar focused on salary 
negotiation best practices to ensure equity in the 
workplace and participated on a Zoom call to share 
the initiatives CSX has in place to honor, encourage 
and hire veterans within the entire WWP network.    
Business Resource Groups
We believe every employee’s contributions and 
differences help drive our success. As such, we are 
proud of the many BRGs that have been initiated 
by our employees to connect with colleagues that 
have shared interests and experiences. Each BRG 
is led by an executive-level sponsor, with the goal 
of promoting a diverse, inclusive and engaged 
workplace culture. CSX’s BRGs include:
       ABLE Disability Inclusion Group:   
Represents employees with physical and 
intellectual disabilities, driving internal awareness 
and collaborating with CSX business partners 
to design, develop, and build accessible and 
inclusive services and offerings for employees and 
customers. ABLE hosted three events in 2020 
focusing on educating employees on disability 
awareness and providing resources for families of 
children with disabilities.        African American Inclusion Group (AAIG):  
Focuses on creating a culture that embraces 
inclusion and promotes African American 
representation at CSX and for our industry 
through three core pillars – community

02Attracting, Developing and  
Retaining the Best Railroaders 
We continue to build on our four-pillar talent  
strategy to better enable us to attract, develop and 
retain the best railroaders. Our strategy warrants  
that every position and every person adds value;  
we value diverse experiences and skills, compensate  
our workforce well for their achievements and 
motivate them to succeed. 
We are extremely proud of the persistence our  
team demonstrated over the past year as they 
navigated through unexpected personal and 
professional challenges. From a slow down in 
business at the beginning of the pandemic to a  
rapid growth in demand in the middle of summer,  
our team of best-in-class railroaders was able to  
keep the wheels moving.
Talent Acquisition
We are dedicated to attracting top talent from 
different industries and backgrounds to bring in 
critical expertise, diverse experiences and skillsets 
that position our company for sustained growth.  
We provide our interviewers with training  
 in interviewing best practices and eliminating 
unconscious bias to ensure that they are  
equipped to identify high-potential talent.  
In 2020, 36 percent of management new hires  
were diverse and 22 percent were female. Talent Development 
CSX adjusted its talent development approach by 
increasing online training classes, giving employees 
more flexibility in their schedules as they pursue 
their professional development. Our classes are 
comprised of new and seasoned employees to 
create a more diverse learning environment. 
This year, 525 management employees and 560 
union employees completed 1,086 online courses 
through our learning portal. 
Additionally, using Microsoft Teams, a newly 
implemented technology for CSX, over 873 
employees attended 45 department-wide training 
sessions on a variety of topics including emotional 
intelligence, mastering difficult conversations,  
antitrust, trip plan performance and others.
Employee Engagement 
As our employees are at the core of our success,  
it is important that they are engaged in the 
business, motivated to succeed and equipped with 
the skills necessary for their continued growth at 
the company. To understand what’s truly important 
to our employees and how we can best support 
them, we gather data and insights through surveys, 
assessments and ongoing measures. These 
insights are helping us build a strong foundation 
for culture transformation.Compensation and T otal Rewards
CSX offers a competitive compensation and 
benefits package for our railroaders to help  
drive our recruitment efforts, promote retention  
and enhance engagement in the organization. 
CSX’s total rewards packages for our 
management and union employees are  
designed to support employee recruitment, 
retention and engagement, as well as our  
short- and long-term growth objectives as 
a company. We regularly benchmark our 
compensation and benefits plans and  
offerings against railroad and general industry 
standards to ensure our total rewards remain  
at or above market.

02Our Continued Investment in  
Serving Those Who Serve
2020 marked the second full year of our signature 
community investment initiative, CSX Pride in 
Service – our companywide commitment to honor 
and serve the nation’s military, veterans and first 
responders. We understand intimately the sacrifice 
that comes with military service, as nearly one in  
five CSX employees have served in some capacity, 
and we proudly maintain and operate our very own 
police force to keep our tracks safe. Furthermore,  
our Jacksonville headquarters, hub markets in 
Baltimore and Nashville, and 23-state train network 
roll through communities near military bases and 
areas with high concentrations of military families. 
CSX understands and values all that our military, 
veteran and first responder heroes have done in 
service of our country – and that, oftentimes, these 
very same servicemembers find themselves on  
their own once they’ve returned home or are no 
longer in the line of duty. Primary hardships include 
feelings of isolation from their communities and 
financial adversity. To address these issues, CSX  
has contributed more than $7.2M to causes 
supporting military, veteran and first responder 
families since Pride in Service’s inception. 
Additionally, CSX employees contributed more  
than 5,700 volunteer hours in support in 2020.  Demonstrating Our Pride in Service
Each year, CSX connects thousands of 
servicemembers and their families with the 
support they need, when and where they need it. 
At the onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, the CSX 
team acted quickly to address a natural extension 
of the program, providing support to the new, 
‘frontline’ responders – the men and women 
battling the pandemic in healthcare settings  
across the country. 
With Pride in Service’s founding nonprofit 
partner’s – Blue Star Families , First Responders 
Children’s Foundation , Operation Gratitude , 
Operation Homefront  and Wounded Warrior 
Project  – CSX makes possible support in three  
core areas: critical financial assistance,  
community connections and acts of gratitude. 
In just over two years,  
CSX has supported more 
than 300,000 military, 
veterans, first responders 
and their family members 
– more than tripling the 
company’s goal to impact 
100,000 individuals by the 
end of 2020. Critical Financial Assistance 
Service families are disproportionately affected 
by financial hardship, both during active duty 
service as well as when the servicemember 
returns home. To support military, veterans and 
first responder families struggling with finances, 
CSX turns to Pride in Service partners to make  
an impact. 
       With Operation Homefront ,  
CSX has historically provided financial relief 
grants and recurring support programs that 
help military families thrive. In 2020, CSX 
funneled more than 9,000 grants to families 
in need, many of whom were facing new 
challenges including furloughs and layoffs, 
new medical bills and caregiver challenges. 
CSX also connected expectant mothers and 
children returning to school with the supplies 
they needed for a successful transition. 
       With the First Responders Children’s 
Foundation ,  
CSX reallocated funding to best serve urgent 
needs, becoming the founding member of 
the organization’s ‘COVID-19 Emergency 
Relief Fund’ benefiting police and firefighter 
families directly impacted by the pandemic. 
In 2020, we partnered to support 90 
emergency grants and make possible more 
than 90 scholarships for the children of first 
responders with dreams of pursuing higher 
education.

02Community Connections 
Due to frequent relocation and other factors,  
military families often report feeling disconnected 
from their civilian neighbors. While frontline workers 
and first responders remained as a clear audience  
in need in 2020, military families already facing 
feelings of isolation were also at further risk and in 
need of social, emotional and financial support. 
       In partnership with Blue Star Families ,  
CSX launched two more Chapter Communities  
in Tampa, FL, and Dayton, OH. These 
communities join existing Chapters in 
Jacksonville, FL, Chicago, IL, Clarksville, TN,  
and Baltimore, MD, with the aim to connect 
military families with their civilian neighbors 
through community building events, programs 
and other resources.
       With Wounded Warrior Project ,  
CSX sponsored Carry Forward – the  
nonprofit’s signature run/walk 5Ks, community 
fundraisers designed to bring together civilians 
with those who served. In 2020, more than 
125 CSX employees came together virtually 
to recognize servicemembers for their acts of 
heroism and raise funds for the cause. Acts of Gratitude
CSX and our employees embraced the opportunity 
to give thanks for those who serve by participating 
in virtual engagements in support of military, 
veteran, first responder and healthcare heroes 
alike. Together, employees raised or donated  
more than $80,000. 
       With Operation Gratitude ,  
CSX supported ongoing virtual volunteerism 
activities in the form of letter writing campaigns 
and holiday care package creation. CSX 
employees penned more than 500 letters of 
thanks to servicemen and women at home and 
overseas, and packed and delivered more than 
200 care packages to deployed troops unable 
to return home for the holidays. 
Through Pride in Service  
CSX is proud to have been recognized for  
our work in community investment. In 2020,  
CSX was awarded and/or named to the following 
CSR recognitions and rankings: Engage for Good 
Halo Award for Employee Engagement, Military 
Times Best for Vets Award and U.S. Veterans 
Magazine Best Top Veteran-Friendly Companies. Leveraging CSX’s Core 
Business for Good
In March 2020, COVID-19 brought the country  
to a standstill. Despite cities shutting down  
and communities all across the globe adjusting  
to new remote lifestyles, CSX’s rail and 
intermodal trucking business remained essential 
to keep America moving. Faced with new 
demands from the first and frontline responder 
communities, CSX’s Pride in Service combined forces with long-time partner, Operation 
Gratitude, to transport essential supplies and 
gifts of thanks to first and frontline responders 
in hard hit cities. Within days, CSX and Operation 
Gratitude teams loaded intermodal trucks at 
the nonprofit’s California warehouse and made 
bulk deliveries to East Coast cities including 
Allentown, PA, and Newark, NJ. 
“Service is very important to CSX. As railroaders, we 
provided our own service throughout the challenging 
times COVID-19 presented, connecting first and frontline 
responders to much-needed resources and supplies. 
Because of our existing relationship with Operation 
Gratitude, it was natural to pivot our work together when 
the pandemic hit. We quickly joined Operation Gratitude’s 
Coalition to Support COVID-19 Frontline Responders and 
are proud to have been able to offer the support of part of  
CSX’s core business – intermodal and trucking – to move 
essential supplies across the country.”

02Driving Impact in Our Hometown
As a pillar of the Jacksonville community,  
CSX remains committed to supporting diverse  
needs through Pride in Service, community service 
grants and employee volunteerism. In addition to 
serving our hometown with our Pride in Service 
partners, in 2020 we contributed $1.5M to support  
a number of additional organizations including  
City Year, JDRF, the St. John’s Riverkeeper, the  
United Way and more. 
Providing Relief in the Wake of Disaster
In 2020, a number of hurricanes impacted CSX’s 
service territory. In response, together with 
employees, CSX partnered with the American Red 
Cross  to provide aid to communities in need. 
In the wake of COVID-19, CSX allocated funds  
to support employees through the CSX Employee 
Disaster Relief Fund. The company put in place a 
new set of processes and protocols to evaluate  
the needs of employees going through  
catastrophic situations. Supporting Our Employees’ Passion  
for Giving Back
We make it easy for employees to contribute their 
time and support through community partner 
organizations as well as a number of programs  
and policies which allow them to select the causes 
and organizations that mean the most to them. 
       Dollars for Doers:   
When a CSX employee volunteers at least  
15 hours, the CSX Foundation donates $10 per 
hour volunteered, up to 40 hours, to an eligible 
organization of the employee’s choice.
       Employee Matching Gifts:   
We match dollar-for-dollar any donation made 
by a CSX employee to a 501(c)(3) organization 
of the employee’s choice, up to $1,000. In 2021, 
we will be expanding our employee matching 
program to allow for more support of social 
justice organizations. 
       Board Service:   
CSX executives are eligible to serve on  
nonprofit boards of their choice through  
the CSX Foundation Board Service program. 
The Board Service program contributes to  
the organizations with which CSX executives 
are affiliated and provides counsel and 
guidance for CSX executives looking to become 
involved with a nonprofit board.

Highlights & Performance
In 2020, CSX was recognized for our environmental 
leadership by CDP, an independent, global non-
governmental organization dedicated to advancing 
sustainable business practices, and improved to the  
“A List” rating for our actions to cut emissions, 
mitigate climate risks and help increase corporate 
transparency. CDP’s A List is the highest ranking a 
company can achieve. The 2020 climate change  
A List recognized 277 companies, with CSX ranking 
as the top U.S.-based Class I railroad.  
In line with our 2019 performance, we  
maintained our industry position as the most  
fuel-efficient U.S. Class I railroad, and in 2020 
became the first to use less than one gallon  
of fuel per 1,000 gross ton-miles. 
Additional information on our environmental 
performance, progress and goals can be found  
in the Future of Freight  section of this report. CSX Employees  
Championing the Environment 
Our employees are critical to our success, and they go above and beyond to  
ensure we are meeting our environmental goals. In 2020, the AAR  recognized  
Corey Davis for his leadership in advancing CSX’s environmental stewardship  
and initiatives.
Corey Davis,  
Director of Fuel Strategy and Utilization   
 
was named as the 2020 John H. Chafee Environmental Excellence Award 
recipient, which recognizes a railroad employee who has demonstrated 
the highest level of environmental stewardship and sustainability in the 
previous year. This comes as no surprise, as Corey’s work to reduce fuel 
usage at CSX over his tenure has had monumental results. The savings 
have reduced fuel utilization by 32 million gallons, cutting carbon dioxide 
emissions by 332,000 tons in just one year. Additionally, Corey has 
worked with his teams to implement initiatives to reduce CSX’s fuel 
usage by nearly 60,000 gallons per day. 
“We’re seeing a growing 
recognition among 
elected officials and 
policy makers that rail 
can and must play a key 
role in our nation’s long-
range transportation and 
environmental policy 
planning. By continuing 
to drive increased 
efficiency, CSX is helping 
to establish rail as an 
important part of the 
solution for addressing 
climate issues.”

02Compliance
The CSX Environmental Operations team remains 
steadfast in prioritizing and achieving compliance 
with local and federal regulations. CSX maintains 
more than 48 Clean Air Act permits and 186 Clean 
Water Act permits across our network. We rigorously 
plan to identify best-in-class technologies and 
training opportunities to further meet and exceed 
regulatory requirements. 
In 2020, we implemented more than 50 internal 
reviews of our facilities to ensure compliance with 
local, state and federal regulations. Our annual  
review program includes self-review, peer-review  
and third-party reviews conducted by consultants 
using a complete multi-media protocol. To ensure 
continued compliance, review findings and 
corrective actions are tracked in an electronic 
management system. This management system 
also helps to determine facility review frequency 
requirements ensuring we are on track in  
completing risk profiles at each of our facilities. Energy Management
We manage energy consumption, fuel use and 
GHG emitted through our operational activities 
– both energy used by trains and our corporate 
offices – by implementing energy, fuel and GHG 
management and reduction measures. 
In 2020, we invested $9.4M in fuel efficiency 
measures, including investments in technologies 
and locomotive use.

T echnologies Driving Environmental 
Efficiencies
CSX maintains several automation initiatives aimed 
to increase both sustainability and efficiency.
The first of these initiatives is our 24/7 Fuel 
Conservation Desk , operated out of our 
Jacksonville HQ Network Operations Center. The 
Fuel Conservation Desk monitors all active CSX 
line-haul locomotives in real time and houses a 
team that manages locomotive horsepower and 
efficiency. The minute-by-minute monitoring 
allows CSX to identify locomotives that can be shut 
down, rather than remaining idle, to conserve fuel.In 2020, we also invested in the integration 
of Wabtec’s  Trip Optimizer technology with 
PTC interfaces, which allows these systems 
to automatically adjust to real-time network 
changes to optimize fuel efficiency, resulting in 
about 6 percent fuel savings. This is an area of 
growth for CSX in 2021 and beyond.
With CSX’s operational transformation, we also 
invested in and began testing an enhancement  
to Trip Optimizer , automated locomotive  
cruise control software. Enhancements to  
the technology will give locomotive operators  
the tools to achieve optimal fuel efficiency  
by allowing trains to automatically start from  
a stop, or automatically apply and release  
the air brakes. Trip Optimizer ensures many  
gallons of additional fuel are not burned in  
waste. Once fully implemented, CSX will  
save approximately 5 million gallons of fuel  
annually as a result of this program.
CSX is currently developing a Meet Pass  
Planner (MPP) that will increase fluidity of  
trains throughout the CSX Network by reducing 
train meet/pass delay while optimizing train 
routing and performance. MPP will use real 
time data to provide dispatchers with dynamic 
runtime calculations and precise forecasting 
models to expedite the decision making and 
conflict resolution process. As development 
continues with MPP it will be enhanced with 
a movement planner and integrated into the 
Core Dispatch System, creating a pathway to 
exception-based dispatching.

02Locomotive Use
CSX’s operational transformation continues to 
deliver both customer and environmental efficiency 
results, reducing the number of trains needed to 
transport the same amount of cargo, or more, every 
year since 2017. 
We regularly review our locomotive fleet to uncover 
operational efficiencies, looking for opportunities to 
decrease the number of locomotives in our portfolio. 
At the same time, with automation technology and 
DP advances, CSX is able to better manage our fleet 
and extend capacity of our trains, including removing 
locomotives from tracks rather than leaving them 
idle on tracks. In turn, CSX has been able to dedicate 
less material and energy on repair and maintenance. 
In 2020, this provided both a decrease in fuel 
consumption across idle locomotives as well as 
opportunity to ensure craft employees remained 
off-yard unless essential throughout the COVID-19 
pandemic.
CSX’s improved trip optimization technology  
and reduced locomotive use resulted in decreased 
total direct fuel usage across all fuel types by 
approximately 12 percent since 2019. Locomotive by Type

Solar Program of New York – an 
initiative which allows New Yorkers to 
go solar without installing additional 
equipment or panels on owned or 
leased real estate. In partnership 
with NextEra, CSX will transition to 
powering 85 percent of its resources 
in New York by solar over a 15-year

02Our Climate Strategy:  
Driving the Transition to a  
Low-Carbon Economy 
CSX understands that sound environmental 
stewardship is essential to address the complex 
global challenge of climate change. As an industry, 
we are faced with both a considerable advantage 
and opportunity: on average, freight railroads  
are three to four times more fuel efficient than  
trucks and produce 75 percent fewer GHG 
emissions. It’s up to us to leverage this opportunity 
to make sure we’re maximizing efficiencies and 
reducing our footprint.  
We implemented several long-term plans  
and goals into our business strategy and risk 
assessments to ensure that we are doing our  
part to reduce emissions while driving impact  
for all of our stakeholders. 
As part of our strategy, we are continuing our 
partnership with the SBTi to work toward the target 
of limiting global warming to well-below 2°C above 
pre-industrial levels. Our commitment made us the 
first railroad in North America to align with SBTi  at 
this aggressive level — an accomplishment we are 
proud of. It is an important first step toward a  
lower-carbon economy. In order to make incremental progress toward  
this target, we made a commitment to reduce  
GHG emissions intensity by 37.3 percent by 2030, 
using 2014 emissions as our baseline. In 2020, 
we made progress by reducing GHG emissions 
intensity by 13.8 percent since 2014, in line with  
our planned reduction trajectory. 
 
We will continue to implement strategies and  
tools to help us decrease our GHG emissions to 
ensure we meet our 2030 goal.Climate-related Risk Management 
Our 12-member Board of Directors is  
composed of a diverse group of business 
professionals with responsibility for climate-
related issues. As part of this, the Governance 
and Sustainability Committee of the Board 
has oversight responsibility for environmental 
matters, as well as responsibility for risk 
oversight and evaluation, including risks 
associated with energy and environmental 
policy. Environmental risks and opportunities 
include those associated with new technologies, 
availability of fuel sources, reputational risks and 
opportunities, anticipated regulatory changes 
and potential shifts in our customers’ businesses 
as a result of climate change. 
All climate-related business risks are  
presented to the Board for consideration,  
and Board committees receive input from  
those departments most competent in the risk 
under consideration. An example of a climate-
related decision driven by our Board was the 
review and approval of the science-based  
target in 2019. The Committee also reviews  
and approves initiatives aligned with meeting  
this ambitious goal.

Climate-related Scenario Analysis
In 2020, we conducted a climate-related scenario 
analysis to establish a new GHG emissions intensity 
reduction target approved by the SBTi. CSX applies 
an internal methodology to evaluate potential 
scenarios where climate change and other types  
of disruption may impact operations and safety.  
As part of that process, short-, medium- and  
long-term time horizons are considered, and action  
is taken. For example:
 
       Short-term  (i.e., 0-3 years) horizon scenarios  
are linked to the CSX capital expenditure  
program which is based on a three-year cycle. 
An example of this includes creating a capital 
budget in response to the likelihood and extent 
of flooding along the Gulf Coast which resulted 
in decisions to harden tracks and raise critical 
equipment off the ground in preparation for 
forecasted severe weather.
       
       Medium-term  (i.e., 3-10 years) horizon  
scenarios include planning for significant 
investments such as locating, constructing,  
or consolidating rail facilities and infrastructure. 
An example of this includes the CSX Select Site 
Programs to identify potential manufacturing  
and distribution sites that could easily utilize  
rail service and take advantage of the 
environmental benefits of rail use.        Long-term  (i.e., 10-30 years) horizon scenarios 
include strategic planning based upon growth 
and technology projections. An example of 
this includes topics like rising temperatures 
and increased frequency of major storms that 
may result in decisions to possibly relocate 
infrastructure and assets along coastal cities 
and ports to more inland locations.
In our climate-related risk assessments, we 
consider the following climate-related risk and 
opportunity types based on the  TCFD risk types 
and classifications.  Risk Type Classification Description
Physical Acute CSX’s rail network encompasses approximately 19,500 route miles 
of track across 23 states, the District of Columbia, and two Canadian 
provinces. As such, weather-related impacts on the company’s 
operations are a regular part of business and are incorporated into 
the company’s operational and financial planning.
Physical ChronicSince the CSX operating network includes potentially vulnerable 
bridges, trackage, facilities and customers along these coastal 
routes, assessing chronic physical climate-related risks is relevant 
and always included in the risk assessment process.
TransitionCurrent and 
Emerging  
RegulationLegislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by  
federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of  
the United States can significantly affect the revenues, costs  
and profitability of the company's business.
Transition LegalCSX is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial, and  
local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among 
other things, discharges to air, land and water; handling, storage, 
use, generation, transportation, and disposal of waste and other 
materials; clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases; 
and the health and safety of employees.
Transition Market Fluctuations in market conditions can have significant impacts  
on CSX revenues, and global economic conditions could negatively 
affect demand for commodities and other freight.

02Once CSX analyzes the climate-related risks and 
opportunities, the information is used to plan for 
business continuity and influence strategy. For 
example, given the significant environmental 
efficiencies of freight rail compared to highway 
transport, CSX has made a substantial strategic 
decision to emphasize intermodal freight haul and 
partner with trucking customers to use train service 
for long haul and truck service for local delivery. For more information on how we incorporate 
climate into our risk management strategy, as well 
as additional climate-related disclosures, please 
see our CDP Climate Change Response  and our 
TCFD index  in the appendix of this report. Opportunity Type Classification Description
MarketsAccess to new 
markets As climate changes, businesses may look to relocate to different 
parts of the United States. With a nearly 19,500-mile network,  
CSX is well positioned to help companies adjust to a need to move 
facilities or modify how they move product to market. 
MarketsAccess to new 
and emerging 
markets As climate change realities affect downstream markets, CSX is well 
positioned to also support these new and emerging markets. For 
example, the increased demand for domestic natural gas has created 
an opportunity for CSX to display agility in serving new and evolving 
energy markets and geographies.

02Recycling, Reuse and Waste Disposal
We are mindful of our recycling, reuse and waste 
disposal practices to ensure we’re operating as a 
responsible company in all manners of our business. 
In 2020, we continued to ensure that supplies are 
properly reused and recycled, reducing costs and 
eliminating stormwater impacts from stray materials. 
The majority of the waste we generate derives from 
locomotive and equipment maintenance activities 
required for ongoing operations. 
We work to implement practices that help us reduce 
our waste, which includes generating thousands of 
recycled materials each year. We also closely monitor 
the amount of volume we generate at all times, and 
train our employees on how to put recycling and 
reduction techniques into practice. Some specific 
examples include:
 
       •  Disassembling older locomotives and rebuilding 
them with the latest technology to be safer, 
more reliable, and more fuel efficient 
       •  Launching initiatives to centralize and 
streamline the proper management of 
hazardous materials and used oil
       •  Leveraging engineering teams to execute 
environmental work such as cleaning up third 
party illegal dump sites, laying track matting, 
and restoring stormwater drainageIn 2020, as part of our locomotive rebuild program, 
we took delivery of 28 AC4400 rebuilds (up from 
23 in 2019), which will result in 5 percent fuel 
savings estimated at 200,000 gallons per year 
without the use of emissions credits. 
In 2020, CSX joined a recycling innovation 
initiative led by Purdue University’s Center for the 
Environment (C4E), which focuses on the safe 
conversion of used wood ties to new high-value 
products. In fact, used ties and poles from the U.S. 
rail system result each year in upwards of 6 million 
tons of chemically treated wood waste. 
The consortium, led by C4E researchers, will 
pursue research to effectively, economically and 
sustainably address the challenge of finding new 
high-value markets for custom biochar mixtures 
created from pyrolysis of spent ties. More 
information about this initiative can be found  here . Operation Clean Sweep
CSX is a proud member of Operation 
Clean Sweep , the Plastics Industry 
Association and American Chemistry 
Council initiative to achieve zero loss 
of plastic pellets, flake or powder to 
the environment. Each year, with 
our customers, we move thousands 
of tons of plastic pellets. It is CSX’s 
commitment to work in partnership 
with these organizations and our 
plastics customers to ensure pellets 
are not lost to the environment during 
transportation. As part of this initiative, 
CSX Railroad Operations team 
assesses facilities regularly, reviews 
housekeeping procedures, and raises 
employee awareness to routinely  
make necessary upgrades.“Environmental 
stewardship is a priority 
for both CSX and our 
plastics customers. 
Our participation as a 
member of the Operation 
Clean Sweep initiative 
represents an important 
step we’ve taken to 
further the sustainability 
efforts we’ve put in place 
as a business.”

We also look for ways to divert waste 
generated through partnerships 
and throughout our office activities. 
E-waste has become the fastest 
growing waste stream in the world 
with an estimated 50 million tons 
of electronic waste poisoning the 
environment annually. Through 
our e-waste buyback program in 
partnership with Urban Mining , CSX 
diverted more than 34,000 pounds  
of waste away from landfills in 2020. 
This amounts to 980 pounds  
of toxic metals and 48,000 pounds  
of GHG emissions that were reduced  
because of the diversion.Water Management 
As demand for water increases, our 
resource management practices must 
respond accordingly. The primary activities 
involving water at CSX include washing 
locomotives and other equipment and 
suppressing dust. As such, we manage 
our water consumption by identifying and 
implementing water reduction, recycling 
and reuse measures during these activities. 
This includes taking care to track our water 
use in certain operations, such as rainwater 
collection and recycling, wherever feasible.

Board of Directors 
CSX’s Board of Directors is comprised of prominent 
leaders who are responsible for decision making 
based on opportunities and challenges facing our 
business, and ultimately influence the company’s 
long-term growth and success.
In 2020, the board was comprised of 12 individuals, 
each with a broad scope of backgrounds and 
expertise. Board members play a critical role in 
developing the company’s long-term strategy 
to deliver sustainable shareholder value, while 
monitoring and mitigating against unnecessary 
risk. Additional oversight is provided through Board 
committees including: 
       • Audit Committee  
       •  Compensation and Talent Management 
Committee
       • Executive Committee
       • Finance Committee
       • Governance and Sustainability CommitteeIn 2020, the Governance Committee changed 
its name to the Governance and Sustainability 
Committee and revised its charter to formally 
include sustainability oversight. This includes the 
review of CSX’s sustainability policies, strategies 
and initiatives; sustainability performance; and 
ESG reporting. To further ensure Board-level 
oversight mirrors the evolving priorities of the 
company, matters pertaining to human capital

Responsible Business 
Practices
Business Ethics  
The CSX Code of Ethics  serves as the foundational 
policy that guides ethical behavior at all levels of our 
company. The code applies to all CSX employees 
and officers, CSX wholly owned subsidiaries, as well 
as members of the Board of Directors and partners 
conducting business with or on behalf of CSX. 
People at every level of the company are  
expected to act with the highest standards of 
personal integrity, consistent with the company’s 
own ethical standards. The code also covers 
additional business matters including conflicts  
of interest; insider trading; confidential information 
misuse; compliance with laws and regulations; 
discrimination and harassment; whistle-blower 
protection; public and employee safety; and proper 
use of corporate assets. Our ethics training focuses on applying the code in 
daily interactions and is provided throughout the 
year. Training is mandatory for all management 
employees and highly recommended for union 
employees. In 2020, we evolved the training 
structure which is now comprised of two core 
sessions with a more extensive selection of  
modules under each, including modules focused  
on security training and other topics.  
Additionally, the 24/7 CSX Ethics Helpline, 
operated by an independent service, is a resource 
through which employees are encouraged to 
anonymously report code violations or other  
ethical concerns. In 2020, there were no  
significant violations of the code.Shareholder Outreach  
and Engagement
Ongoing shareholder engagement is a key 
component of effective corporate governance, 
allowing us to better understand evolving trends 
and to enable strategic decision-making to 
deliver shareholder value. Senior leaders and 
subject matter experts meet routinely with 
institutional shareholders and periodically with 
proxy advisory firms to discuss CSX’s business 
strategy, corporate governance practices, 
executive compensation and ESG matters  
that are in the best interests of our broad and 
diverse shareholder base. 
CSX also engages with shareholders and 
other interested parties through participation 
in industry and investment community 
conferences, investor road shows and analyst 
meetings. In 2020, CSX maintained an active 
shareholder outreach program, incorporating 
virtual participation in investor conferences, 
small group meetings and non-deal roadshows. 
We also leveraged the increased use of virtual 
meetings to expand international outreach.
Executive Compensation
CSX provides competitive total compensation 
in line with general market practices. Our 
Compensation and Talent Management 
Committee is responsible for reviewing CSX’s 
annual and three-year business plans and  
global economic forecasts to set appropriate  
and challenging performance goals for our 
Executive team. 
Safety is a top priority at CSX. At all times, our 
efforts must reflect our commitment to prevent 
injuries and accidents. We continue to be 
relentless in pursuit of safety and accountability 
by always looking for ways to improve.  The addition of safety performance metrics in  
2019 as part of the MICP is designed to reinforce 
our focus and commitment. 
In addition to the safety measures, in 2021  
CSX introduced a fuel efficiency metric to MICP 
to continue the focus on and commitment to 
protecting and preserving our environment 
through the efficient use of fuel. Trip Plan 
Performance has also been added to further 
strengthen and align our commitment to 
customer service excellence.

Risk Management and Business 
Disruption Prevention 
As an integral player in the transportation of essential 
goods, we have robust measures in place to predict, 
manage and respond to risks so that we are prepared 
for and can mitigate any potential disruption to our 
business. In 2020, we invested nearly $1.4 billion  
in capital expenditures to maintain and improve  
our existing infrastructure and help prepare for  
any eventualities. 
The board’s Audit Committee oversees our risk 
management strategy. This includes oversight 
of CSX’s Enterprise Risk Management program, 
through which business and functional leaders 
collaborate to identify, assess and monitor risk, as 
well as implement needed mitigation strategies. 
Our approach to risk management focuses on both 
the activities we can control and those we cannot. 
New regulations issued at the federal level are 
monitored and continually assessed as part of our 
risk assessment process. Business risk factors are 
further described in our Annual Report .
Under our centralized enterprise risk management 
processes, we have integrated a multidisciplinary, 
company-wide climate change strategy that 
evaluates all types and sources of risks and 
opportunities. To mitigate the physical risk 
of climate-related extreme weather, we have 
established comprehensive business plans that are 
designed to ensure continuity of train operations  
and the adaptability of CSX’s network. More 
information on our climate-related scenario analysis 
can be found in the Climate Strategy  section.Building Network Resiliency
We take a proactive approach to strengthening 
our network to mitigate risks, ultimately 
safeguarding the continuity of train operations 
and the adaptability of CSX’s network. Natural 
events, including pandemics, had previously been 
identified as a potential risk under our centralized 
enterprise risk management processes. In an effort 
to lessen the impact of these risks, we established 
comprehensive business plans that enabled us 
to respond quickly and effectively to COVID-19, 
ensuring the safety of employees across the 
network and allowing CSX to continue providing a 
high level of customer service.
CSX’s Environment Management System (EMS) 
promotes, measures, tracks and improves 
sustainability across our operations. It provides a 
clear, actionable plan for actively managing and 
minimizing the environmental impact across our 
facilities and locomotives. Additionally, we are 
taking proactive measures to further address 
climate and make measurable contributions, 
including the science-based target we committed 
to in 2019 to work toward limiting global warming 
to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.Cyber and Information 
Security Management
Information technology is an essential 
component across our business, including 
the protection of our customers’ personal 
information and the integrity of our own 
operations. As part of its risk management 
responsibilities, the Audit Committee is 
responsible for the oversight of the Company’s 
cybersecurity program and risk mitigation 
strategies. Our Information Security team 
equips our systems with the latest cybersecurity 
tools with defense in depth protection layers; 
provides critical cybersecurity information to 
all application users; and regularly conducts 
required cybersecurity awareness trainings. 
One hundred percent of CSX management 
employees received mandatory cybersecurity 
training. Within the security team, approximately 
70 percent have industry-recognized 
cybersecurity certification.
We encourage all employees to report any 
suspicious or unusual behavior observed on 
or around electronic resources to the CSX 
Information 24x7 Technology Service Desk that 
fields approximately 4,700 service requests a 
month. CSX has robust, proactive measures 
in place to detect cyber incidents and triage 
any identified risk. Incidents reported by our 
employees are tracked through a streamlined 
service desk tool and monitored by a dedicated 
Security Operations Center (SOC). Identified 
risks are tracked, prioritized and managed from 
inception to validated remediation. 
To ensure we are engaging around these topics 
on a broader and collaborative level, we are 
proud to work with the AAR and industry peers 
to exchange information regarding threat 
intelligence and best practices to advance how 
the broader industry approaches these issues. Strong performance and reliability of our 
technology systems are essential to our ability to 
operate safely and effectively. CSX Technology 
maintains a 99.9 percent reliability index. 
Following an internal audit of our cybersecurity 
controls in 2019, we adopted a new cybersecurity 
framework in 2020 to better ensure ongoing risk 
coverage of key areas.  
Our security infrastructure is tested on an 
ongoing basis to evaluate and build detection 
and prevention capabilities, along with third party 
assessments on a regular basis. Through these 
efforts, in addition to employee training in 2020, 
we directly experienced zero information security 
or other cybersecurity breaches.

02Responsible Sourcing and  
Supply Chain Standards
We view our suppliers as an extension of our 
company — equally dedicated to environmental 
stewardship, high ethical standards and diversity. 
We work with approximately 4,800 suppliers 
domestically and internationally, all of which we 
expect to adhere to the CSX Code of Ethics. In 
2020, we began engaging in CDP’s Supply Chain 
membership program to find synergies with 
suppliers and advance ESG practices to bolster 
ongoing conversations and knowledge sharing. 
These efforts continued over the course of 2020, 
during which we engaged suppliers on a daily  
basis on updates and operational changes.
Through our Supplier Diversity Program,  
CSX has committed to procuring all materials, 
supplies and services as outlined in our Diverse 
Supplier Procurement Policy . To that end, we  
offer opportunities for all suppliers, regardless  
of any social or economic distinction, such as 
age, race, creed, color, sex, ancestry or national 
origin. While we do not award suppliers based on 
preferences that would result in unfair competitive 
advantages over other suppliers, we are  
committed to actively seeking and engaging  
diverse suppliers to compete for opportunities  
to support CSX.Human Rights  
CSX is committed to operating its business in  
a manner consistent with international human 
rights principles, including those contained in  
the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and Global Compact and the International 
Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work. 
In 2020, we formalized and published our 
commitment to upholding human rights across  
our operations, businesses, communities and 
supply chains in the CSX Human Rights Policy .  
The policy addresses responsible business 
practices regarding diversity and inclusion;  
a harassment-free workplace; safety and 
security; compensation; freedom of association; 
anti-corruption; accountability to employees; 
supplier expectations; and pledge to fight human 
trafficking, further outlined below.Human Trafficking  
At the beginning of 2020, CSX joined a U.S. 
Department of Transportation (DOT) initiative 
to fight human trafficking through increased 
education and public awareness. CSX signed 
the U.S. DOT “Transportation Leaders Against 
Human Trafficking Pledge” and committed the 
company’s support to help raise awareness and 
collaboration across the transportation and  
travel industries.  
Through its “Put the Brakes on Human 
Trafficking” campaign, the U.S. DOT is enlisting 
the help of the transportation sector to combat 
human trafficking because transportation 
employees are often in a position to spot 
potential victims. CSX, through its BRGs, also 
supports employee and community efforts  
via in-kind donations and resources to assist 
survivors of human trafficking.

Materiality Assessment 
Building on the materiality assessment we 
conducted in early 2020 (whose process and 
results can be found in our 2019 ESG Report ), we 
decided to refresh our analysis given that 2020 was 
a year of societal change. As an essential business 
critical to delivering services to communities 
across North America, COVID-19 prevention 
and response became an important part of our 
operations in 2020. We also wanted to assess how 
our stakeholders prioritized social justice and racial 
equity as a material topic given CSX’s continued 
work to create an environment where our employees 
and communities feel included and our actions to 
eliminate inequities where they exist. Because of 
these factors, it was crucial to get the valued input  
of our key internal and external stakeholders on  
our sustainability topics.
We conducted a survey of more than 700 internal 
and external stakeholders, including employees, 
union members, customers, suppliers, investors, 
nonprofit organizations, and others, where we  
asked them to rank the importance of each issue  
as it pertains to decisions stakeholders make 
regarding CSX on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the 
most critical to business decisions and 1 being  
not relevant). The matrix shows the topics plotted  
on an x-y axis from 6-10 as none of the issues  
presented scored below a 6.This exercise led to a prioritization of the issues 
most material to our business and stakeholders, 
the results of which are displayed in the matrix on 
the right.
These materiality findings reflect a few key 
updates from our previous assessment. As 
expected, due to the impacts of COVID-19 and 
the steps CSX has taken to ensure safety for 
our employees and community, coronavirus 
(COVID-19) prevention and response was ranked as 
a top priority. Additionally, diversity and inclusion 
was prioritized higher by stakeholders this year, as 
was accessible and transparent communications. 
In 2020 and moving forward, we are continuing 
to deliver education, development opportunities 
and communication that heightens awareness and 
understanding of diverse employee perspectives 
and are committed to transparent communication 
to all stakeholders on all our ESG efforts. As such, 
we have increased our disclosures on these topics 
in this report. 
Similar to last year’s assessment, ethical  
business conduct, employee and community 
safety, and excellent customer service continue  
to be top priority issues to stakeholders. The 
following table defines the top 14 material topics, 
identified through our materiality assessment 
process with an average score above 8.0. These 
topics are discussed in further detail throughout 
this report based on these definitions. Materiality Matrix

Stakeholder Engagement
Promoting accessible and transparent 
communications continues to be a top priority at 
CSX, as we have a responsibility as a business to 
make a positive impact on all our stakeholders.  
Below is a complete list of our stakeholders, 
including employees, customers, communities, 
suppliers, investors and nonprofit organizations.  
We use a variety of channels throughout the year  
to engage with stakeholders, ranging from informal  
(e.g., one-on-one conversations) to formal  
(e.g., materiality assessment). 
For example, we asked stakeholders to share their 
thoughts and feedback on CSX’s ESG efforts in this 
year’s materiality assessment. Most stakeholders 
were pleased with CSX’s efforts, providing guidance 
for how the company may continue to position itself 
as a leader in the industry. This includes continuing 
to incorporate sustainable business practices and 
ESG metrics into the corporate strategy and into the 
goals and performance improvement initiatives that 
CSX and its stakeholders rely on for success. We are 
keeping this feedback and sentiment in mind and will 
continue to work to further establish our leadership 
position in the industry. These different types of engagement  
opportunities allow us to solicit important  
feedback on our ESG efforts while also  
being able to provide relevant updates. 
In line with providing transparent communication 
with stakeholders, we provide in-depth information 
on each of the specific sustainability topics they 
are interested in. Along with this 2020 ESG 
report and the 2019 ESG Report , we make this 
information available through our CDP report and 
other publicly available documents, including the

01  Diverse spend is defined as the amount, in dollars, spent with 
suppliers that are small, minority-owned or women-owned 
businesses.      
02  Average active trains per day excludes passenger and foreign 
trains. 
   
03  Frequency of internal railway integrity inspections is the number 
of inspections per week, weighted for the number of main track 
miles on which those inspections took place. Calculated as 
(weekly inspections × miles of track on which they took place) / 
(total main track miles).  
  
04  FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index calculated as cases / 
200,000 employee hours. Safety statistics are estimated and 
continue to be updated as actuals settle.   
   
05  FRA Train Accident Rate tracks FRA reportable train accidents 
per million train miles. Safety statistics are estimated and 
continue to be updated as actuals settle.   
   
06  Rate of work-related injuries and illnesses. An injury or illness 
is considered a recordable incident if it results in any of the 
following: death, days away from work, restricted work or 
transfer to another job, medical treatment beyond first aid 
or loss of consciousness. Additionally, a significant injury or 
illness diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care 
professional is considered a recordable incident, even if it 
does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work 
or job transfer, medical treatment beyond first aid or loss of 
consciousness.      
07  Fatality Rate is the rate of work-related fatalities / total number 
of full-time employees.  
 
08  Number of accidents and incidents (combined) is any impact 
between railroad on-track equipment and a highway user at 
crossings. It includes any collision, derailment, fire or other 
events involving the operation of railroad on-track equipment 
that results in reportable damage above thresholds established 
in 49 CRR 225.5; other incidents or exposures that result in 
fatality or injury to any person, or result in occupational illness of 
a railroad employee.     
 
09  Number of accident releases and non-accident releases of 
hazardous material is the unintentional release of a hazardous 
material while in transportation, including loading and unloading 
while in railroad possession that is not caused by derailment, 
collision or other rail-related accidents.  
 
 
 
  10  Number of violations resulting from the U.S. FRA or state 
inspections or audits. Violations include any safety-related issue 
including those related to accident reporting, grade-crossing 
signal safety, hazardous material regulations, industrial hygiene, 
motive power and equipment (e.g., freight car safety, locomotive 
safety and passenger equipment safety), railroad operating 
practices (e.g., alcohol and drug use, hours of service laws, 
communications and operating practices), signal system safety 
and track safety. Includes violation defects that both did and did 
not result in civil penalties.  
  
11  Number of defects resulting from the U.S. FRA or state

13  2016 employee data has been updated from previously reported 
information.  
 
14  Inquiries handled by TellCSX, CSX’s contact hub for non-
emergency issues. In 2020, we made changes to our tracking 
process and now track the total amount of incidents handled. 
   
15  Hazardous and non-hazardous waste from ongoing operations 
values have been corrected from the 2018 CSR data supplement 
report because LEADS data was reported in the wrong location 
in 2018 and has now been corrected. LEADS data will be 
reported with non-hazardous ongoing operations waste data 
moving forward.      
 
16  Non-hazardous waste from ongoing operations in 2016-2018 
was recalculated to include recycled and reuse waste.  
     
17  Non-hazardous waste from remediation and emergency 
response activities in 2016-2018 was recalculated to include 
recycled and reuse waste.     
  
18  Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions data corrected from the 
2018 CSR data supplement report due to change in utility 
management vendors and their calculation methodology.  
The increase reflects corrected natural gas usage.  
     19  Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions data corrected from 
the 2018 CSR data supplement report due to change in utility 
management vendors and their calculation methodology. This 
increase is due to the increase in corrected electricity usage. 
      
20  GHG emissions intensity in line with science-based target goal set 
in 2020. A gross ton mile (GTM) represents the movement of one 
ton of train weight one mile. GTMs are calculated by multiplying 
total train weight by the distance the train moved.  
     
21  Reduction of GHG emissions based on 2014 value of 12.1 metric 
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per MGTM.   
    
22  Nitrogen Oxide and Sulfur Oxide values for 2017 and 2018 were 
recalculated to account for new emission factors in 2017 through 
December 31, 2019 that now includes values reported from 
stationary source.     
  
23  Carbon Dioxide data has been corrected due to recalculated 
increase in Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  
24  Methane data has been corrected due to recalculated increase in 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
 
25  Nitrous Oxide data has been corrected due to recalculated 
increase in Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
 
26  Volatile Organic Compounds, Carbon Monoxide and Particulate 
Matter values are newly calculated and reported using data from 
the corresponding inventory year.   
 
27  Natural gas data has been corrected from the 2018 CSR data 
supplement report due to change in utility management vendors 
and their calculation methodology. Reported usage increased 
from 3,310,435 therms (349,186 GJ) to 5,404,183 therms 
(570,035 GJ).     
 
28  Energy consumption outside CSX data has been corrected 
from the 2018 CSR data supplement report due to change in 
utility management vendors and their calculation methodology. 
Reported usage increased from 309,402 MWh to 438,944 MWh. 
      
29  Energy intensity data has been corrected due to the increase in 
natural gas and electricity usage (MMBTUs).   
    
30  Revenue ton mile (RTM) is calculated by multiplying the miles 
traveled on each leg by the number of tons of revenue traffic 
carried on that leg.     
  
31  Water withdrawal data has been corrected from the 2018 CSR 
data supplement report due to change in utility management 
vendors and their calculation methodology. 146Global

Statement of Veriﬁ  cation
1611.1 Scope
Jacobs performed a verifi  cation of CSX’s 2020 GHG Emission Inventory to determine if 
a reasonable level of assurance could be provided. CSX’s management is responsible for 
the collection and presentation of the information within the 2020 Emissions Inventory. 
Jacobs’ responsibility is to express a conclusion as to whether anything has been identifi  ed 
to suggest that the reported Emission Inventory is not presented fairly in accordance with 
referenced GHG accounting principles and associated guidance documents.
1.2 Methodology
Our verifi  cation review was completed in accordance with ISO 14064-3:2019 section 6. 
As such, Jacobs planned and performed the verifi  cation activities in order to provide a 
reasonable assurance with respect to GHG emission intensity information reviewed. 
1.3 GHG Assertions
CSX asserts that their total annual location -based Scope 1, Scope 2, and listed Scope 3 
emissions for the 2020 reporting period (exclusive of purchased goods and services and 
capital goods) is 4,000,741 metric tonnes CO2e. 
1.4 Conclusion
Based on the verifi  cation review conducted, the GHG Scope 1, Scope 2, and listed Scope 
3 (exclusive of purchased goods and services and capital goods) assertions in CSX’s 2020 
Emissions Inventory are materially correct and presented fairly in accordance with stated 
criteria.
