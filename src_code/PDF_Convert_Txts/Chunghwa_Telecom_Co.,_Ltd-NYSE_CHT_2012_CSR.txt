Carrying the environment on our shoulders
The Chunghwa Telecom CSR Report is printed using environmental-friendly soy ink.1A message from the Chairman
A new generation of active communication and cloud computing has already started to 
have a profound impact on the lifestyle. Chunghwa Telecom believes that our core technology 
and industrial skills lie in the areas of digital confluence and cloud integration. Assisting in 
industrial growth and adapting to problems such as climate change, food security, health 
and disease, and public education will be important challenges for the future.
In 2012 Chunghwa Telecom received international recognition, chosen for the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index (DJSI), emerging market index, for the first time. Furthermore, we have been honored with the SAM Silver Award along with BT , Vodafone, and other international telecom companies. This proves that environmental sustainability through public participation is a key part of the Chunghwa Telecom corporate governance strategy. We will uphold our forward looking and innovative concepts, to achieve the goal of becoming “the most valuable and trustworthy telecom company.” 
For the development of cloud computing, we have developed unique and innovative 
services by providing the ‘individual cloud’, ‘storage cloud’, ‘enterprise cloud’, ‘tourism cloud’, 
‘transportation cloud’, and ‘health cloud’ solutions. We have developed the Virtuoso cloud 
system software for enterprises to create a complete plan for integrated cloud services. With an eye on the international market, we have also taken concrete action to spur the growth of the cloud computing industry in our country. 
With a surge in creativity and with close alliances and partnerships, we have become 
a distinct and active enterprise that cooperates closely with society. By sharing value and using the “collaborative cooperation” theory, our country’s industrial development can be upgraded. Apart from combined domestic enterprises to form the “Taiwan Cloud Computing Industrial Society” to spur innovative ways of thinking and developing energy saving know-
how for the future, Chunghwa Telecom’s innovations are very competitive – in the fields 
of sightseeing, cloud computing, MOD, Hami, and six other development platforms, we 
cooperate with every leading firm in Taiwan. Entrepreneurship creates 
new value, and is the key to the competitive strength of Taiwan’s cloud 
computing application industry.
We will continue to work towards combining both sustainability and 
growth, as well as our ultimate goal of being a company that combines 
telecommunications, information, value-adding, digital confluence, 
and cloud integration services in one coherent body. We will strive 
to create a “digital rainforest” and let the excellent Chunghwa network 
platform become a tool for industrial growth. We want to construct 
a forward looking, sustainable, win-win industrial ecological 
system that will spur and upgrade our country’s industry 
and add value for our stakeholders. We humbly ask that 
people from all walks of life help guide us and provide 
suggestions for this path.

Management of Subsidiaries
We are proceeding cautiously with strategic planning, assessment, 
evaluation, post investment management, performance assessment, withdrawal mechanisms, discipline, etc. with respect to transfer investments. Not only do we regularly analyze business conditions and the performance of the transfer investment industries, but we also assist our subsidiaries in the formulation and promotion of performance management systems.
Our internal control covers group level risk management and 
administrative level business activities, to enforce risk control mechanisms for subsidiaries. At the same time we have formulated a management mechanism to manage the appointments of the CEO, President, and shareholder representatives of transfer investment businesses, in order to facilitate examination and managerial duties.Effective Management of Capital Expenditure
Combined capital expenditure for 2012 totaled NT$ 33.28 billion, of 
which NT$ 19.55 billion was spent on fixed domestic communications (including dial-up and broadband networks), NT$ 7.23 billion on mobile communications, NT$ 3.44 billion on the Internet, NT$ 2.38 on fixed international communications and 0.68 billion on others.
Broadband operations consisted primarily of installing fiber optic 
networks to encourage ADSL clients to upgrade and catalyze user base growth and increase network efficiency. Mobile operations consisted primarily of upgrading coverage rates of 3G/ HSPA/HSPA+ and other high-speed networks while maintaining network communication 
quality. In the next two to three years, there will be capital expenditures 
related to cloud operations. 
Our equipment purchasing and R & D expenses enjoy investment tax 
credits and incentives. Please find the disclosure in our financial report in 2012.

We believe that using unique corporate resources and specialization to focus on related public 
issues and improve the competitive environment can be of benefit to society as well as the 
corporations. At the same time, maturation of corporate social responsibility needs to be infused 
into the core activities of a corporation so that it becomes a cultural foundation to empower integrity and inspire innovation.
The Taiwan CSR Benchmarks
The driving force behind Chunghwa Telecom CSR comes from global 
corporate deployment, the risks and opportunities for corporate image and 
reputation, the requirement of disclosure of non-financial performance information, competition for competent personnel, etc. 
Since the creation of corporate social responsibility initiative in 2007, our 
objectives are to use voluntary actions to fulfill sustainable development and infuse corporate social responsibility into core business processes. Over the years, Chunghwa Telecom has become a CSR benchmark for the Taiwan telecommunications industry, and we will gradually develop CSR from corporate strategy to competition strategy, and further into organizational operation strategy.
Global Recognition
Chunghwa Telecom has replied the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI)  
questionnaire since 2008, and by continuing learning and improving that we was named to DJSI emerging market index in 2012. At the same time, we are the only telecommunication service company in Taiwan that received silver class rating by RobecoSAM. Besides, we also received second place in Asian Sustainability Rating (ASR) in 2012, which is the best grade among Taiwan companies.
These honors represent international organization’s recognition of 
Chunghwa Telecom’s CSR performance, and we will keep working hard to push the sustainability development in company and the society.
Scope of Chunghwa Telecom CSR
Reflect and Restart
Chunghwa Telecom has led CSR development domestically among similar 
industries and has been recognized with related awards over the years. After the competent authorities promulgated “Corporate Social Responsibility Best Practice Principles for TWSE/ GTSM Listed Companies,” we began formulating our own “CSR policy”.
In accordance with the plan, the board will be responsible for: CSR 
policy, the management system, CSR mission, reviewing the efficacy of 
implementation and continuous improvement. The existing CSR committee is 
responsible for the strategy of various tasks. There are six teams responsible for proposing action programs and annual plans and implementing performance evaluations and review.
Our core values are “honest management, professionalism,  and  executive  
power.” Based on this, our CSR can be expressed in the following schematic diagram. The essential core of our CSR is “Sustainable Operation.” We hold ourselves to high corporate ethics and moral standards in order to attain and maintain social and government recognition.

Strategy Management Action Response Target11The Establishment of CSR Management System
Chunghwa Telecom is a CSR benchmark in the Taiwanese telecommunications industry. We will 
keep developing CSR from corporate strategy, competition strategy, and further on to organizational 
operation strategies in investment, production, and management. We will also infuse management 
visions for CSR and environmental sustainability and follow them accordingly.
The SMART Management System
We have deepened our commitments to CSR since its introduction in 2007. 
The “Corporate Social Responsibility Best Practice Principles for TWSE/GTSM 
Listed Companies” is now fully integrated into our business processes.
The SMART CSR management system has unique strategies, management, 
actions, responses, and target stages to account for the six aspects of CSR: corporate governance, employee care, consumer care, environmental sustainability, digital opportunities, and corporate volunteering. External and internal assessment procedures are used at the end of each year and task groups formulate new targets for the following year. They also assess 
themselves to decide whether they might require additional reinforcement.
Raising Corporate Value
We believe that the strategic planning and management of CSR will 
effectively control risks, lower costs, increase brand values, and create 
new growth opportunities. In the future, we will continue to apply our core capabilities as we enforce ethical business practices to create corporate social responsibility benchmarks; enter the cloud age, create responsible brands, address climate change, concentrate on digital opportunities, and face the challenges of the new era. The core of all strategies points to the same objective, our vision to “become the most valuable and reliable information and telecommunications company.”

Communication with Stakeholders
Chunghwa Telecom combines CSR with our daily business management because we believe it 
prepares us for future challenges and creates more value for company development, clients, and 
the vast stakeholder base. We focus on listening to the voices of all our stakeholders, and have 
adopted a proactive communications approach to promptly and reasonably respond to external demand.
Multilayered Channels
The core of CSR is engagement with stakeholders and the identification 
of key issues. Since the first CSR report in 2007, Chunghwa Telecom had 
been enhancing interaction by inviting stakeholders to meetings with relevant departmental managers. There are third parties that review our CSR reports to ensure their reliability and accuracy.
Different stakeholders have concerns for different issues. Therefore, 
we have an assessment team across all departments to identify the level of concern and influence on each issue. The following top 10 key issues were generated into a Key Issue Matrix:  1.Customer Relationship Management: Customer Satisfaction, Problem-
solving procedure, Service Quality Management.
2.High Quality Signal: Provide clear, reliable service of voice and data 
telecommunication service.
3.Firm Management: formation and operation of the board of directors, 
Audit,   Remuneration of directors, supervisors and senior manager.
4.Financial performance: Raise turnover, lower cost, and pursue 
impressive income.
5.Attracting and Keeping Talented Employees: Employee performance 
appraisal, Remuneration and reward system.
6.Rates: Provide fair rates and explanation of charge for rates.
7.Information security: Establish policy for customer privacy protection 
and management.
8.Abide by regulation: Abide by associated regulation, avoid illegality and 
punishment, and keep communicating with supervisory organizations.
9.Investor Relationship: Keeping Financial reports transparent, Continue 
returning reward to investors.
10.Sustainability and innovation: Keep innovating in product or service, 
including ESG elements.
As the market is becoming more saturated and competitive, companies 
are actively trying to attract more customers; therefore, more than half 
of the issues above are customer-related. Because we are usually one of the best targets to invest, there are also three issues related to finance: corporate governance, financial performance, and investor relationship.
To maintain the market share and get more supports from customers 
in the future, we need to provide more incentives to attract talents, speed up the innovation and sustainability plan, develop product and service that are closer to the demand from customers.Key Issues Analysis

(NFC)” with four main services: Identity and access tokens (Card emulation), Contactless Transmission (Reader/writer mode), NFC Business Card Exchange(P2P mode) and TSM Secure Transaction Platform.    
The combination of smartphones and Hami Intelligent wallet 
provide users with credit card, debit card, EasyCard, and membership cards services. Users can connect the different cards and services in the SIM card through the cellphone’s NFC TSM safe transaction platform. Through Over-the-Air Technology, users can download cards in their cellphone, make a NFC payment, NFC e-Tag sensor execution, and transfer files. This is the first Telecom Company to have the NFC TSM platform in Taiwan.
So far the trial plan is only available for the designated trial users. 
After this stage of the NFC trial plan is complete, we will work on partnership with SEEDNet to promote business plans by area.

EnvironmentalSupplier has yet to formulate a written environmental policy and has not formally requested that suppliers comply with environmental regulations.
SocialCompany has yet to formu-late a written labor policy or health safety policy.Expansion of Supplier Management
We were the first Taiwanese telecommunications company to formulate supplier management 
policies. In 2009, we completed the “Basic Status Survey on Corporate Social Responsibility for 
Suppliers” questionnaire. In 2010 we held supplier conferences and sent questionnaires out by 
mail. The “Chunghwa Telecom Supplier CSR Guidelines” and “Operating Guidelines for Promoting Supplier Implementation of CSR,” were released in 2011 and 2012.
International Management Standards
The “Chunghwa Telecom Supplier CSR Guidelines” specifies what we 
expect from our suppliers with respect to CSR standards. We hope to express 
our commitment and responsibility to suppliers through these guidelines and show respect for worker’s rights and a sustainable environment. Contents of the “guidelines” include five aspects: Corporate Standards, Ethical Standards, Labor Standards, Environmental Standards, Health and Safety Standards, which apply to all suppliers providing products or services to the Chunghwa Telecom Group, subsidiaries and joint venture companies and companies in the supply chain.
According to the “Operating Guidelines for Promoting Supplier 
Implementation of CSR,” we will strive to understand supplier CSR implementation status through the provision of training, surveys, onsite visits, or third party verification. These measures for facilitating supplier implementation of CSR will be planned and executed by the secretary of the CSR committee.
Supplier CSR Status Survey and Audit
According to our preliminary supplier sustainability assessment plan, 
suppliers in the equipment and labor category will be gradually included in the scope of audits to integrate ESG factors (environment, social, governance) and supplier selection criteria. We began preparing a supplier sustainability assessment plan that is expected to be implemented from 2013.
Hosting Supplier Social Events
On December 27, 2012, Chunghwa Telecom held the 2nd CSR Supplier 
Social Event. 60 firms were invited, 41 firms attended with a total of 64 representatives. The executive deputy general manager Shi hosted the event, with other departments’ representatives. We invited Mr. Huang of BCSD to give a speech of “Sustainable management and development in Supply Chain”, and then we reported the result of 2012 questionnaires. By two-way communication, we hope to let suppliers learn more about our thinking and doing in CSR.

Identifying and controlling risk incidents are corporations’ responsibility. Our framework contains 
comprehensive risk management policies and systems, augmented by complete information systems 
for recording and tracking, effectively utilizing risk control performance and reducing risk and danger in managerial aspects.
Risk Analysis and Response
Chunghwa Telecom has high-level meetings for important strategy 
planning or impact caused by environmental change. We formulated the 
“Chunghwa Telecom Risk Management Regulations” to act as reference for our employees. The President is the person with the highest level of responsibility for risk and crisis management who reports to the Board of Directors.
We have risk maps for risk assessment tools, at the same time, we 
conduct sensitivity analyses and stress tests for the company’s major business operations to minimize possible losses through risk absorption, risk transfer, risk reduction, and risk avoidance.
Climate Change Risks
The most serious climate change in Taiwan is short-time heavy rain. 
In the long term, it causes rise in temperature and sea level, which can affect the telecom facilities’ operating system. Therefore we have list the climate change risks into management assessment, taking the risks into consideration in the annual operating plan, and set goal management and achievement. 
Due to climate changes, we use ICT’s new technology and products to 
reduce the impact it has on the social environment, raise resource usage efficiency, develop energy conservation and carbon emission reduction technology, develop environment protection information system and hope 
to create new business opportunities and environment sustainability.

Cap and trade 
schemesTaiwanese government plan to set up a carbon-trading platform once the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act is effective. CHT already established an Environmental Sustainability Group prepared for related issue. We will be able to trade and benefit from its carbon quota saved and increase revenue.
Extreme Precipitation The weather patterns in Taiwan have become extremely stormy with high precipitation. The flood damages equipment, which disrupts and creates abnormality in the services.It will take USD 10 million to reinforce the telecommunication control room from flooding damage.
Sea level riseTaiwan is an island. The rise of sea level means damaged telecommunication equipments. Inevitably, more cost has to be spent on relocating control rooms 
and repairing equipments.
Change 
in mean temperatureRise in temperature can lead to a large increase in energy consumption by business equipments and home appliances. Which means the demand of green products and services will also increase.We estimate the potential profit is up to USD 100 million in Taiwan from our Intelligent Energy Network service.
Reputation riskProducts and services offered by the telecom company are expected to meet the target of energy conservation and carbon reduction. If we do not meet those standards, our reputation might be at risk.Each year, CHT invested USD 300,000 on Carbon management action plan and communication.Organization Authorities and Responsibilities

We are committed the goal CSR information disclosure and have received recognition from 
stakeholders in all segments of society. In the future, we will continue to lead the competent authorities, 
disclose various information according to international standards, and strengthen communication with stakeholders to gradually become the industry standard for disclosure in Taiwan.
Ensuring GRI Frameworks as Principle
After the introduction of the “Corporate Social Responsibility Best 
Practice Principles for TWSE / GTSM Listed Companies,” the Taiwan 
Stock Exchange further refined terms for corporate social responsibility information disclosure for publicly listed companies. The Taiwan Stock Exchange proposed the Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 3.1 version ( GRI 3.1 ) as the most important reference and framework of information disclosure. We will continue to emphasize CSR issues and report publication.
Inviting Stakeholders to Read Reports
In order to comply with article 8 of the “Corporate Social Responsibility 
Best Practice Principles for TWSE / GTSM Listed Companies,” we began identifying stakeholders and found that the most important stakeholders are clients, employees, shareholders, suppliers, the community, and non- profit organizations. We began holding stakeholder conferences in 2011 which were divided into specific and general conferences. Stakeholders were invited to offer opinions on that year’s CSR report.Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Reduction Disclosure
The Taiwan Stock Exchange encourages publicly listed companies 
disclosing greenhouse gas emissions and reduction information in their annual reports and public documents. We follow orders from regulatory agencies and voluntarily disclose relevant information to enhance corporate governance and fulfill corporate social responsibilities.
Chunghwa Telecom is the first Taiwanese telecommunications 
company to pass greenhouse gas examinations and certifications. In the future, we will also gradually disclose relevant information and continue to act as the benchmark of Taiwan’s domestic service industries.AA 1000 as Reporting Certification Standard
We adopted AA 1000 as our reporting certification standard in 2009. 
AA 1000 is the certification standard devised by the Institute of Social and Ethical Accountability, which emphasizes that report certification shall be based on its production process, such as confirming the identities of stakeholders, communication with stakeholders, and confirming mutual issues with stakeholders. We have adopted training classes and other methods to enhance recognition for AA1000 within subordinate groups of the CSR committee.
Strategy Management Action Response Target24Enhance Code of Conduct
During the process of operations and task performance, our employees must strictly follow the code 
of conduct and moral guidelines and may not compromise for any reason. Ethical business practices 
not only enhance investor confidence in the company and increase corporate values; they can further reduce fundraising costs and achieve win-win objectives for enterprises and investors. Therefore, we have formulated the “Ethical Corporate Management Best Practice Principles for the Chunghwa Telecom” to be the policy followed by all of Chunghwa.
Abiding by the Code of Conduct
To establish a highest standard that applies to board members, 
supervisors, managers, and employees, we formulated the “Chunghwa 
Telecom Code of Conduct” as the basic guideline that governs the execution of daily tasks by our employees. The conduct includes personal and group responsibility, and responsibility to the company, public, and other stakeholders with the goal of preventing misconduct. 
Besides, the “Chunghwa Telecom Code of Conduct Violation Case 
Acceptance Points,” “Chunghwa Telecom Implementation Guidelines for Protecting Trade Secrets,” “Chunghwa Telecom Human Resources Employee Complaints Hotline,” and a strict reporting mechanism allow employees to conduct commercial activities worldwide with the highest ethical standards. 
Obey International Telecommunication Laws and Human Rights Duties
The International Telecommunication Union held the World Congress 
on Information Technology (WCIT) in Dubai near the end of 2012. The conference set an International Telecommunication Regulations to ensure there is a general rule for free circulation of global information, and add new contents, such as “transparency of competing and fees for mobile roaming”, “Provide convenient access to telecommunication service for the disadvantaged”, “Protection for the freedom of speech”. As our membership, we commit to follow the regulation and put into practice to spread it.

Public Private Partnership
Corporate integrity management is a priority issue that everyone 
concerned currently. The United Nations proposed a Global Compact in 1999 to make anti-corruption one of the major subjects of CSR, by doing so to advocate corporate responsibility and create integrity and fairness business environment. APEC also has categorized “enhancing CSR” and “combating corruption” as two critical global issues. 
Hence, the board approved 23 articles in the “Chunghwa Telecom 
Code of Business Integrity” in December 2010, which clearly specifies the regulation. Board members, supervisors, managers, employees, and also investment companies are ask to comply with.

Reference: The International Telecommunication UnionStrategy Management Action Response Target25Internal Consensus
Goals of establishing company standards are to unify the internal 
consensus, ensure to ban dishonest behavior, and implement integrity 
management with good corporate risk management mechanisms, which to help to create a sustainable operating environment. Key implements are as follows:
1. To strengthen determination and commitment, specific company 
regulations and external documents are clearly announced for integrity management policy and its implement.
2. Avoid transactions with those who have dishonesty records in order to conduct commercial activities under fairness and transparency.
3. Prohibit bribery, accept of bribes, provide illegal political contributions, improper charitable donations, sponsor unreasonable gifts and hospitality, or other improper benefits.
4. The board of directors should urge the company to prevent dishonesty and ensure to implement policy through dedicated department.
5. To implement integrity management, all Chunghwa people should conduct business by regulations so as to prevent dishonesty.
6. Clearly specify a conflict of interest avoidance policy for board members, supervisors, and managers.
7. To ensure the implementation of integrity management, the company should establish an effective accounting system and internal control system. Internal auditor should regularly confirm compliance status.
8. To implement the promotion of integrity management, clearly specify that the company should regularly hold education and training, and establish an expedient rewards and disciplinary system.
9. Clearly specify that the company should strengthen the fulfillment of integrity management information disclosure.
Besides, we especially set up a team and a report channel to execute 
the anti-fraud plan, in order to protect company confidentiality and 
prevent illegitimacy.
Ethical Evaluation of Employee Behavior
All our employees are required to take the “Chunghwa Telecom Code of 
Business Conduct and Code of Conduct Test” each year to maintain their professionalism and integrity, which optimize corporate governance and risk control, and establish honestly principled corporate culture. Nearly 99.95% staffs passed the test in 2012. Additionally, the Chunghwa Telecom “Employee Review Guidelines” and “Reward and Discipline Standard” are published to evaluate employees, who are also confirmed to thoroughly understand and followed.

In addition to balancing customers, shareholders, and employees, we are committed to creating 
overall social value. We are also committed to becoming the leader in domestic cloud computing 
and driving the shared value of the domestic industry. The cloud service became widely applied to commercial use since 2012.
Lead Cloud Computation
In recent years, cloud computing has become an important trend in the 
development of the telecommunications industry. Chunghwa Telecom 
is also actively preparing development. Simply put, cloud computation consists of cloud servers, terminals, networks, and services. Cloud “networks” and “services” are part of Chunghwa Telecom’s industry and two of its advantages which connect the “cloud” to the “terminals” and provide people and businesses with convenient cloud computation services.
In 2011, cloud services emerged from infrastructure construction in 
the concept stage, into the year of cloud services. Currently, in addition to providing customers with services such as relationship management services, computing cloud, cloud anti-virus and anti- hacking, cloud storage, etc., we are also promoting the six primary services of the personal, storage, business, travel, circulation and health clouds with partners from different industries. At the same time, we are actively strengthening cloud infrastructure through cooperation with strategic cloud partners such as Microsoft, Intel, Fujitsu, Trend Micro, Quanta, Show Chwan, etc. to drive the development of the cloud computing industry in Taiwan.
Found Cloud for Animation and Visual Effects Center
In 2011, Chunghwa Telecom and Hollywood special effects company 
Rhythm & Hues Studios (R&H) created the Cloud for Animation and Visual Effects (CAVE). It uses Chunghwa Telecom’s control room, Internet Communication and Virtuoso and R&H’s techniques and experiences at Hollywood. With cloud computing to target the need of special effects in movie, it has already used in the movies “Life of Pi” and “Snow White and the Huntsman” 
Furthermore, both parties have signed the memorandum of 
understanding in 2012 and have plans to establish a company that merges the quality from both parties to bring in Hollywood’s special 
effects technique and experience and raise domestic digital material 
production. Chunghwa Telecom’s Chairman said that to CAVE will be divided into 3 stages for future promotion, and we hope to create a complete platform to let movie artists efficiently use resources while producing a movie in the future.
Strategy Management Action Response Target27Cloud Computing Association in Taiwan
In 2010, we helped to establish the “Cloud Computing Association in 
Taiwan”, and there are already 110 members in the end of 2012. This 
association has become a catalyst for increasing the value of the cloud computing industry chain in Taiwan and allows the industrial, academic, and research sectors to have matching platforms for development, integration, verification, and commerce. 
In 2011, the Association planned and birthed the “Taiwan Cloud 
Valley” in hopes of establishing industry clusters, providing incubation, creating a cloud platform, and other centers for cross nodal operation to become Taiwan’s first cloud computing demonstration industrial park. 
Taiwan Cloud Valley divided into three phases: the first phase is 
to provide virtual demo room for over 30 cloud products, which was already launched in March, 2012. The second and third stage are planned to launch in 2013 and 2014. We hope to lead Taiwan into a cloud service pivot in Asia and play an important role worldwide. Four Centers, One Platform, One Marketplace
Chunghwa Telecom’s cloud computing layout follows the strategic 
framework of “four centers, one platform, one marketplace” to gradually move forward. Four centers refer to an R&D center, test center, operations center, and experience center.
In addition, Chunghwa Telecom has built a large capacity “cloud 
service creation platform” focusing on cloud software developers to build a “Chunghwa Cloud Marketplace’ and provide business customers with one-stop shopping, buy to rent, on-demand, safe, and stable cloud application services. From this we hope to expand cloud application use and build the largest cloud settlement in Taiwan.

34Brand Management 
Chunghwa Telecom possesses unique brand assets in Taiwanese society, which we continue to build 
on through brand management and added value. In 2012, Chunghwa Telecom won the platinum award 
of the telecommunications services section of the “Trusted Brand” award held by Reader’s Digest for the Asia Pacific region for the ninth consecutive year. We are the only Taiwanese telecommunications company to have received this honor.
Brand Frameworks
Chunghwa Telecom adopts concentrated brand frameworks that 
account for individualistic brand presentation. Brand Manager (President) 
is in place to undertake the supervision of all brand management, as well as communicating with the Deputy Brand Manager within each business group during CSR meetings. The Deputy Brand Managers (i.e. vice presidents of subsidiaries) follow the company’s overall brand strategies as they undertake implementation responsibilities, as well as flexibly and independently operating their own designated brands under authorized parameters.
Brand Strategies 
Starting from July 2010, approximately 300 business locations in 
Taiwan will gradually undergo store logo replacement. We hope to present a new sensation to the public with innovative corporate images that combine inspiring services. From 2011, many flagship stores will be established that will include neoadjuvant CI images and colors. From these flagship store displays, consumer recognition and impressions of these neoadjuvant CI images will be enhanced while simultaneously creating a new brand image. By the end of 2012, we have set up 80 new service center (including flagship stores).
New Appreciation from New Colors
We have always led the development of Taiwan’s telecom industry 
through solid experience and professionalism, and we have continuously transformed ourselves and decided to promote a comprehensive and integral renovation on top of our original Corporate Identity. We used bright orange, green, and blue ribbons to endow Chunghwa Telecom with a new spirit and a new corporate image. Not only was the external image reshaped and standardized, the identity and practice of overall internal concepts were even more highly emphasized. Every employee in the company is a brand operator.

Strategy Management Action Response Target36Customer Satisfaction Survey
Chunghwa Telecom aims to aspire to the expectations of our customers. We value customer 
satisfaction as part of our service indicators, and their recognition of our brand. Therefore, we 
regularly commission third parties to conduct customer service satisfaction surveys. We regularly accept the NCC’s telecommunications industry service quality surveys, and our evaluation scores in all criteria significantly exceed NCC’s specified standard scores.
Customer Complaint Handling SOP
To ensure an open, result-driven complaint resolution process 
for customers, our service hotline processes passed ISO10002:2004 
(Guidelines for Handling Customer Complaints), and we are the first and only domestic operator in the industry to pass such an international standard certification. Our target is to complete customer complaints within three business days.
Besides customer service hotlines, customers can file their complaints 
through our website (www.cht. com.tw) or PR hotline (02-2344-6789) authorized by our chairman. After cases are opened, they are passed to the customer complaints handling task force to be processed as urgent cases. Customers can enquire into case pdates at any time via telephone and our customer complaints handling task force will inform customers of the latest updates on their cases.
Customer Service Satisfaction
There are three sources from which we survey customer satisfaction 
for service hotlines: 1) manual out dialing from our call centers; 2) automated surveys by the CTI system; 3) entrust Chunghwa University to mail out questionnaires once a year.
The first and second methods are integrated as one KPI requirements 
with satisfaction calculated on a 5 point scale, result of 4.578 in 2012.The third method has individual KPI requirement calculated on a 10 point scale, result for 2012 was 7.60.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
To understand customer satisfaction levels for all aspects of service 
and recognition of our corporate image, brand values, and service quality, we contract external market research firms annually to conduct customer satisfaction surveys for consumer, and types of enterprises. Questions and expectations that they are highly concern are explored in all aspects of our business.
Through the Customer Opinion Process System (CPS), we can convey 
customer feedback opinions instantly to product administration, and operational units, risk management, and public relations department for further handling. Furthermore, product subsidiaries will assist by holding monthly review meetings with customer service units.
Note: In 2011, the service satisfaction indicator was con-
verted from a 5 point scale to a 10 point scale.

services without worries, in addition to proactively explaining product features and pricing when 
selling products, we also actively manage adult content to protect minors and perform actions such as abiding by electromagnetic radiation specifications, etc., to exclude potential negative effects.
Ensuring Transparency in Fees and Rates
Due to the issues of billing errors or costs derived from obstacles, 
we uphold the principle of cost transparency. In addition to actively 
notifying affected customers, we also release the reasons and methods for each event by customer service hotline through the company’s internal message notification platform. We place great respect to customer complaints with regard to billing problems, suspend the execution of payment and service suspensions before responsible parties are identified, we have also established a special call center provide customers inquire to increase customer satisfaction.

the over 3,500 items of related product information annually, an internal website is established to be the information storage area, hence to undertakes the pre and after-sales service of the products. Trained personnel are also alerted to audit information content, timeliness, and upload data to customer service center. Hence to provide service personnel references for inquiry and product features (ex: related discount events) and strengthen customers service.
Electromagnetic Radiation Standards
CHT still strictly follows the standard made by government. We not 
only refine our base station, but also provide an exclusive complaint channel, if any of the public concern about electromagnetic radiation, each can apply for a free professional measurement.
We sponsored ”Simulate Radiation Coverage Analysis of Low-
frequency Wireless Broadcast System” research, to examine the electromagnetic radiation impact, and the result showed that with ICNIRP standard, it will not cause an excess of electromagnetic radiation to human. 
In order to reduce total base stations and visual impacts to the public, 
we constructed cooperative stations with industry partners and the percentages of them also conform to the standard requirements from the authorities.
In 2012, we and other trades entrust telecommunication association 
to set up a fan page on Facebook, we also host online events to propagandize the right notion of electromagnetic radiation from base station. Together with the National Communications Commission, we hosted, a mobile communications electromagnetic wave carnival, in July of 2012 at Yingge Museum.

And we held 37 educational courses with 2,249 people attended in 
2012, to promote the information security, and received “ISO 27001:2005 Information Security Management System Authentication” from BSI.
Privacy Protection and Information Security
We have established the “Fraud Disruption Operation System” (FDOS), which works with police 
units to prevent fraud. Also, we continue to monitor formulation of regulatory obligations of Internet 
Service Providers (ISP) in the drafting process of the “Regulatory Regulations on Commercial Spam Electronic Mail.”
Customer Privacy Service and Measures
In response to the implementation of the “Personal Data Protection 
Act” in October, 2012, we established “Personal Data Protection Team” 
under the “IT Strategy Committee”. We set up personal data safety training and awareness plan, personal data process analysis and inventory plan, risk assessment plan, which are all categorized as our KPI indicator.
To strengthen customer data protection, Chunghwa Telecom has 
categorized basic customer information as “top secret” documents and stored in locked counter. Employees are asked to sign the “Trade Secret Protection Contract” and their supervisors are jointly liable. Any outsourcing company is involved in trade secrets, must also sign related confidentiality agreements. Subsidiaries report protection status annually; headquarters perform random audits at customer service centers to enforce the implementation.
We treat the rights and interests of our customers as priority; we follow 
strictly to the Personal Information Protection Act and had never got beyond any range. We only collect data for legitimate and legal reasons. We have added “Collection Inform of Customer’s Personal Information Clause,” “Customer’s Personal Information Application and Disposition Form” and similar document. We also provide protection services to customer, such as search and review their personal information, cease marketing usage, delete their information, etc.

government. As of 2012, it is operated by 14 customer service personnel on monthly basis to assist police bureaus in undertaking priority cases during peak hours. The FDOS, operated by 3 customer service personnel, was also created to provide suspicious fraud-like phone calls information to the police, which is to assist police units with the instant termination of fraudulent calls.
Strategy Management Action Response Target40Building a Broadband Network
Going online anytime anywhere has become a necessity and trend for modern people, therefore, we 
are expanding both submarine cable capacity and participation in the construction of new submarine 
cable systems. We are also actively provisioning fiber optics, and the construction volume of fiber optic network access equipment surpassed ADSL in 2012. In addition, we continue to construct wireless internet hotspot infrastructure to create even more wireless internet hotspots, relieve mobile data traffic, and increase service quality.
Non Isolated Islands in Communication
In order to prevent occurrence and spread of disasters, from past 
experience we enhanced measures such as the construction of remote area 
transmission routing, wireless backup routing, upgrade backup power capacity, international submarine cable supporting system, etc. Drills for Network repair and equipment schedule are held yearly to enhance disaster prevention and relief skills and reduce disaster losses.
Mobile phone communications are a necessity for most people, we 
introduce a proper backup plan: base stations arrangement in dispersed configuration, so if any base station break down or equipment malfunction, the other base stations in the system can maintain operation. When communications are interrupted by a natural disaster, small microwave, satellite (transported by helicopter, small capacity), or portable base stations (vehicle transported, large capacity) maintain communications to the disaster area.
Fiber Optic Network Construction
At the end of 2012, the coverage of our 100Mbps broadband was 73.6%. 
We achieved the 70.0% goal set by the government in 2012; we estimated the coverage will increase to 85.0% in 2013.
By 2015, government plans to achieve 80% household coverage 
of 100Mbps broadband, 7.2 million fiber optic users, and 11 million 
mobile broadband users. Therefore, we plan to invest 100 billion to 
build broadband network, create digital convergence and develop more innovative services.
At the end of 2012, we have approximately 2.45 million customers using 
the Hinet FTTx Network Service and the number of customers is expected to reach 3.22 million in 2013. The number of customers use 50Mbps or above is 1.51 million, 100 Mbps is 0.3 million; and number of customers use mobile network, we estimate that it will be 348 million in 2013.

Going online anytime anywhere has become a necessity and trend for 
modern people. Especially with the rapid growth of smart phone and 
tablet PC users, mobile broadband traffic has grown exponentially in the last couple of years. Between 2011and 2012, we invested over 10 billion to expand mobile broadband network infrastructure, and procured over 2,000 units of 3.5G base stations to upgrade the capacity, transmission speed and coverage of mobile broadband network.
At the end of 2012, we have built 35,000 wireless internet hotspots 
and 100 wireless internet hot zones. Besides, we have over 6.39 million 3G users to relieve mobile Internet demand.
In order to provide our 6.39 million 3G users with easily accessible 
3G and Wi-Fi, we provided the automatic authentication function(EAP-SIM), starting in Jan. 15, 2013, for iPhones with contract. Meanwhile, our Android system device users can download our free “CHT Wi-Fi” App, with a one time account and password they can have easy access to CHT Wi-Fi. 
Ubiquitous Telecommunications Service
To safeguard the basic communications rights of citizens and to allow 
all citizens to enjoy ubiquitous telecommunications service fairly is a policy goal that the government is promoting for the long term.

remote villages and underdeveloped areas nationally with telephone 
service and over 80,000 households with data communications 
services, over 81,000 public telephones in 25 counties and cities, and 
data communication access services to 3,700 elementary schools and libraries. 
The total net cost of Chunghwa Telecom ubiquitous service construction 
in 2012 amounted to 850 million NT$. Regarding broadband network infrastructure, we expect to complete 12Mbps broadband service at 75% coverage for 716 remote villages nationally by 2013, 85% coverage by 2014, and 95% coverage by 2015.

Influence of Policy and Legislation
In order to catch up to the European and American’s liberalized 
telecommunication market, the national communications commissions decided to adjust the current telecom charge policy. Beginning of 2013 there will be controlling over medial price among industry. The National Communications Commissions also decided to reduce the mobile termination rates next year to promote constructive competition.The mobile termination rates refer to when a customer makes a call to someone who is not a customer of the same company, both companies must calculate the share cost according to the speaking time. Starting in 2013, the mobile termination rates will decline gradually in four year, from NT$ 2.15 to 1.15 in 2016. And the monthly fee of fixed line will follow the X value to continually decline in four year.
We will continue to communicate with the competent authorities and 
hope the industry and government can cooperate to establish a healthy environment that is advantageous to mobile broadband development.4G Licensing

We believe that employees are the company’s most important assets and cooperative partners. 
Therefore, we respect every employee, with no differentiation with respect to gender, age, or race. 
Wages are also paid on the principle of commensurate wages for commensurate work. And Chunghwa Telecom is the only operator in Taiwan that has established a Union and signed a collective bargaining agreement with employees. In 2012, the ratio of employees in the union is 99.87%.
Protection of Human Rights
Our business spread throughout the country and the standard starting 
salary is higher than the required local wage. In 2012, Chunghwa Telecom 
employed a total of 24,351personnel, with 17,407 male and 6,944 female employees with making up 28.52% total, and the percentage of female employees in managerial positions is on the rise and was 24.35% in 2012. To accommodate the needs for customer services and sales, we have contracted 3,837 positions. 
To abide by the constitution, protect human rights, and uphold 
the spirit of the Act for Gender Equality accounted for more than half the entire body. In 2012, no discriminatory incidents were reported. According to Article 38 of the People with Disabilities Rights Protection Act, Chunghwa Telecom should employ 228 persons with disabilities. In fact 753 such employees were actually hired, 3.32 times higher than the legal requirement. In 2012, we employed 49 aboriginals, and properly respect their unique cultural traditions.
Channel for Complaint
If an employee should observe conduct in their unit that is in breach 
of regulations or against the law, they may file a complaint or report it via the hotline, fax or email. The reported case will be investigated in accordance with corporate regulations and procedures. If such case is found to be true, the appropriate punishment will be imposed for the sake of the employees’ code of conduct, corporate discipline, company image, and stakeholder rights. However, no such human rights case was filed in 2012.

In line with our early retirement buyout, and employee career 
planning, retirement is pending for 676 employees at this time, 513 male 
and 163 female. The turnover rate is 2.78%. To ensure continuity and to pass on our expertise, we have recruited 395 new employees, 297 male and 98 female.
For the protection of employee rights, all company employees enter 
into a formal labor contract with the company. For those who have served for more than three months, but less than one year; more than one year, but less than three years; and more than three years, a ten, twenty, or thirty-day notice period is respectively in force.
We will start early to communicate the implementation schedule to 
the relevant units and personnel, and hold communication seminars with the corresponding union officials and personnel to ensure smooth organizational adjustment. This allow job transition and continuation base on mutual agreement, to realize a more refined integration service and a company image of harmonious operation.
Employee Turnover rateSmooth Communication Channels
Employees not only enjoy the right to appeal, complain, and to Union 
membership, but the collective agreement also stipulates that labor-employer representatives from headquarters and all branches and subsidiaries shall hold at least one labor-employer meeting every 3 months, to coordinate labor-employer relationship. 
There is also a Labor-Management Meeting once every 2 months to 
cope with regular issue, with provisional meetings to be held if necessary. There should be 9 representatives from both sides during each meeting and both sides take turn presiding over the meeting. There is a total of 6 Labor-Management Meeting and 1 provisional meeting held in 2012. Furthermore, there were 2 labor related consultative conference held, both labor and employer have sufficient voice at the meetings to express their concerns and interact positively to avoid conflict and realize harmonious labor- employer relations.

We focus heavily on competent personnel. To assist them with balancing career development and 
family life, we took the initiative and implemented unpaid childcare leave systems. We also provide 
health and preventative care that exceeds legislative requirements. In 2012, the employee health care expenditure accounted for 0.044% of annual revenues.
Industry-Academic Cooperation
An “International Corporate Staff Training Plan”and “Chunghwa 
Telecom Southeast Asia Scholarship” have been formulated with a focus 
on expanding our overseas markets. Scholarships to the National Chiao Tung University are awarded annually to competent Southeast Asian and foreign students.
To raise our employees’ understanding of the new trend of 
communication, we initiated the “ Advanced Telecommunications Network Technologies” program with the National Taiwan University, and fifty of our colleagues have trained over four terms in each class. We have further expanded our employee training to include Network planning, IOT and Cloud computing and application in 2012. We also encourage employees to engage in lifelong learning, in 2012, a total of 1,028 employees applied for learning bursaries and NT$ 16.13 million were invested.

To ensure labor safety and health, we have established two labor 
safety and health organizations: The Occupational Safety and Health 
Committee, responsible for reviewing, coordinating and recommending related labor safety and health initiatives; Management Units for Labor Safety and Health, responsible for planning and processing and labor safety and health related services.
At least one meeting is trimestral held by the committee, with one 
additional provisional labor- employer meeting if necessary. In 2012, the committee has 26 members and nine of the members are labor representatives; and In 2012, the Occupational Safety and Health Committee discussed 19 labor healths and safety related issues in the meetings and all were solved satisfactorily.
We proactively provide workplace related health and safety 
facilities and programs to establish safe, clean and comfortable work environments. Regular inspections are made to ensure the effectiveness of such management. We have established a health and safety management system based on the PLAN-DO-CHECK- ACT framework. By the end of 2012, 27 of 28 branches had received certification under the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001. This means that despite the increase in operations across all our services, safety and health in the company is still notable. In 2012, the occupational injuries rate per thousand people was far lower than the industry average.
Operational Safety Management
We have completed the identification and assessment of the different 
hazards and risks associated with the telecommunications industry, and have adopted control measures such as the use of work permits for high risk situations such as working at heights, in confined spaces, manhole and tunnel excavations, hot work, live power lines, cranes and lifts, etc, to lower the risks from such work. 
The “Safety Enforcement Regulations for On-Site Operational 
Personnel” was drafted in 2010 and implemented in March 2011. The focus is on high risk work as mentioned above. In addition to enhancing onsite monitoring and management, we also supplement our information 
and telecommunications professionalism by including the recording of 
3G cell phone images of on-site safety facilities and personal protective equipment before work is started. The pictures are sent to designated systems for real-time monitoring, so that we can observe risk control at high risk work sites and effectively use this as a means to prevent accidents.

Only happy employees can provide a sincere and honest service to customers. We encourage 
employees to start families and initiate a new phase in their lives. Furthermore, our comprehensive 
retirement benefits are the greatest foundation and support for the families of our employees. To provide employees with more benefits, and to share business revenue, we have set up an employee stock ownership trust plan.
Balancing Work and Family
In July 2006, to assist employees with balancing their careers and 
families, we took the lead in implementing unpaid childcare leave. Female 
employees are paid childcare leave benefits equal to half their insured salaries during the leave period which may be for up to 2 years. After employees have received the maximum number of monthly employment insurance payments from the government, female employees can then begin receiving maternity leave benefits equal to half their insured salaries. Family leave, paternity leave, menstrual leave, nursing rooms, etc, are also provided. In 2012, a total of 179 persons applied for childcare leave, while 75 persons applied for unpaid childcare leave, and 65 persons applied for childcare benefits.
Retirement Benefits
To enhance employee welfare and employee loyalty to the company, we 
enable corporate profit sharing by establishing employee mutual funds to ensure stability of employee lifestyle after retirement or resignation. Retirement is processed according to the Employee Retirement Pension and Separation Guidelines, the Labor Standards Act and the Labor Pension Act. For former employees who retired before privatization, their monthly pension payments are paid by the supervisory department from central government.
For those who are entitled to pension payments as specified in the 
Labor Standards Act, a maximum pension contribution 15% is paid to 
their pension funds each month and this process is supervised by the 
Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee at Chunghwa Telecom. For those employees who are in the Retirement Pension System under the Labor Pension Act, more than 6% of their salary (based on Monthly Contribution Wages Classification of Labor Pension approved by the Executive Yuan) is withheld for contribution to their individual labor pension account.
In 2012, Chunghwa Telecom donated NT$4.5 Million to the CHT 
Retirement Association and an additional NT$1.5 Million for travel events to improve the care of retired employees. A dedicated website (http://www.chtr. org.tw/) has also been established to promote healthcare and lifelong learning among retirees.

Strategy and Objective”, a five-year plan (2011 - 2015) as prime directive of the development of 
environmental protection strategy, energy conservation, and carbon reduction. In conjunction with the vigorous implementation of “office and datacenter energy conservation measures,” we have compiled and analyzed all data related to energy usage and paved the way for scientific management.
The establishment of Environmental and Energy 
Conservation Policies
Chunghwa Telecom is the most experienced and the largest of the 
integrated telecommunication operators in Taiwan. Our business covers three major types of communications: fixed networks, mobile, and data networks. As a leader in the Taiwanese market, we pursue growth and sustainable development while offering a more environmentally friendly and energy efficient telecommunications service. To sustainable development issues, we have incorporated environmental protection, energy conservation and carbon reduction, environmental stewardship, and green intelligent building, and formulated specific environmental and energy conservation management plans to improve environmental performance, and to define our direction towards sustainability.
We commit ourselves to the following environmental and energy 
conservation policies to fulfill these commitments:
Follow environmental regulations and promote self-regulated environmentalism
Improve energy efficiency to implement energy conservation and 
carbon reduction
Use green energy and employ green purchase 
Develop green product and promote green economy
Enhance ecological environment and green buildings

the “ Administrative Performance Assessment” and “Performance Evaluation on Power and Air Conditioning Equipment Maintenance” and include them in regular audits. We applied for two international standard certifications to provide a necessary internal procedural framework and establish guidelines and processes for the compliance of organizations and businesses.
The EARTH Management System
Our major environmental protection projects in the environmental 
sustainability system (EARTH) include power and water management, 
greenhouse gas emission, resource recycling, and tree planting. This shows our emphasis on energy conservation, carbon reduction, and environmental protection. Establishment of the EARTH system began in January 2008, R&D resources were vigorously place to extend the EARTH system, which includes the following functions and effects:
1. Energy conservation innovation: Creative ideas from all units upload 
results to the EARTH system to share with others, so as to learn together achieve environment protection.
2. Performance evaluation: Performance is evaluated in a systematic and quantified way to encourage all units to maximize contribution.
3. Power management: The system control over 49,273 electricity registrations and 1.36 million entries of electricity charges. Replaced paper bills with electronic files, this not only facilitate process, but also reduced company resource requirements and provided analysis function that shows power usage trends, power factor statistics, and breach of over power usage. With the help of the exception notification function, we saved NT$8.85million in overcharges by the end of 2012.
4. Water management: By applying electronic billing and collective payment from the water company and collating water usage statistics, our system has controlled over 1,161 water registration numbers and 50,348 entries of water charges. This reduces administrative operation and provides analysis function. With the help of the exception notification function, we saved NT$520,000 in overcharges by the end of 2012.
5. Carbon inventory: EARTH provides carbon verification forms to help carbon inventory, promote carbon reduction measures, reduce operational risks, and enhance the corporate benchmark. We have saved approximately 300 man-days, amount of traveling expenses, and carbon emissions from travel in all regions. 
6. Afforestation: Provided to archive the information about types of trees. Archived logs cover 247 types of trees in the Chunghwa Telecom parks, including 66,468 entries of tree information.
7. Water recycling management: Provided to archive the information about the type, approach, responsible unit, and location of water recycling. Over 5,337,776 tons of wastewater was recycled.

Otherwise, we also enhance communication between internal 
employees, upstream and downstream companies, work together to implement related measures to create a low carbon network. 
ISO14001 Environmental Management Certification
Certification under the ISO14001 environmental management system 
clearly demonstrates our commitment to environmental sustainability. It also offers many benefits, such as proof of environmental performance, more management confidence, reduced environmental management risk, better market competitiveness, regulatory and other compliance, continual improvement, and lower costs.
ISO50001 Energy Management Certification
The ISO50001 energy system management standard primarily aims 
at providing a necessary procedural framework for organizations and businesses by establishing certain guidelines and processes for compliance. This should allow them to maximize energy efficiency in a way that leaves their existing operation unaffected and closely aligned with their business operation strategy and objectives. When supplemented by the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) mechanism, not only can energy use in an organization be continuously improved, but the objectives of sustainability and environmental friendliness can be met by reducing energy cost and greenhouse gas emission. Our Laboratories acquired ISO50001 energy system management certification in 2012 and we plan to get certification of the International Business Group and Data Communication Business Group for 2013.Year Execution Unit

As a large enterprise, we use a lot power therefore we encourage energy conservation. We have 
taken an inside-out approach, starting with the energy conservation monitoring network in the 
largest building in Taiwan, and then gradually improving the energy management and efficiency of the others. We hope that by the end of 2015 we can save 297 million kWh of energy, which accounts for 22% of all conserved electricity.
Power Management Plan and Objective
Our power management objective is to “implement energy conservation 
and carbon reduction plans to reduce power use in telecommunication 
datacenters and office buildings by 12% in 2012 as compared to that of 2007.” With proper control, this objective had already been met in 2011, when our corporate power consumption had decreased by 220 kWh.
During 2012, we have worked with Intel to develop Green Cloud Data 
Center to use Virtuoso and Intel’s Node Manager and Data Center Manager. In accordance with server’s power consumption and management measurement, we can decrease the cloud server power consumption by 5-15%, and prolong operating time by 25% when there is black out. While energy is being conserved the center rack’s density is also increasing. 
We will continue to follow the government energy conservation 
and carbon reduction policies. With the 2007 power consumption as a benchmark, we plan to further reduce our total power consumption by 8% by 2015. It is estimated that our power consumption will decrease 29,750 kWh by 2015 (excluding power consumption from business growth) in contrast to that of 2007, accounting for 22% of total conserved electricity.

Chunghwa Telecom are ahead of the industry to conduct GHG examination by SGS since 2008. By 
using the tool based on GHG Protocol, we compile the data and make up emission inventory for the 
sake of further carbon management plan. 
Carbon Management Plan and Objective
Our carbon management objective is to “bring our greenhouse gas 
emission level in 2012 back to our 2007 benchmark.” Therefore, we 
continue reducing usage of electric power and fossil fuel, which bring us a lower operating cost and carbon emission.
Our greenhouse gas inventory for 2012 showed that our total emission 
for the year counted for 808,961.27 t-Co2 e, and that by using the proper control we can meet our reduction objective (903,800 t-Co2 e) by a significant amount.
In the future, we will maintain this control so that our greenhouse 
gas emission can remain unchanged in 2015 even as business grows. Meanwhile, we will take GRI 4.0 indicators as reference, gradually induce and complete the calculation of carbon emission for Scope 3.

Our water usage primary includes facilities such as restrooms and air-
conditioning. As business expands there will be less room for reduction. Therefore, we turn to rainwater and cooling water recycling as well as water resource management plans to meet the effective use of water.Water Resource Efficiency Management 
Eco-efficiency has been proposed by WBCSD, and is aimed at improving effective resource 
utilization and lowering pollution. We have introduced energy conserving mobile products / services 
and programs designed to assist residential and commercial departments, for example, our water resource recycling management has been incorporated into the EARTH system since 2008.

Water conservation measures
Since 2007, we have been promoting water conservation measures, 
such as spray taps for washbasins, restrooms with two-stage flushing 
devices, office boiled water supply only in office hour, minimum water usage, rainwater is recycled to water plants, repair water supply equipment immediately after damaged and reclaimed new water installations and process used water to the required standard water quality.
Water use reduction objective
Resource recycling 5-year planIn 2012, we used 2,515,000 tons of water, the number is little higher 
than before, because our EARTH system includes more water use data 
and thus the number is more accurate. In the long run, we will continue on water reduction plans to reduce water use by 2% each year, and expect to cut use more than 15% in 2015 compare with 2007, which used 2,431,000 tons.
The statistics show a slight growth on recycled water from 3,733 
metric tons in 2009 to 5,301 metric tons in 2012. To further enhance the effectiveness, we planned for new rainwater recycling systems to collect clean rainwater from the datacenter roof and ground. New condensed cooling water recycling systems will also be installed in the air- conditioning systems in office buildings to recycle water. We expect to reach 1.5% recycling rate of our total water use before 2015.65Impressive Energy Conservation Carbon 
Reduction Results
Energy conservation and carbon reduction is one of the current government priorities. As a 
responsible member of the global village, government will present a succession of relevant action 
plans, and policy objectives will also be amended accordingly to bring them into line with international trends. We will also amend and update our policies every year with the firm vision of sustainability through high efficiency, high value, low emission, and low consumption. 
Introducing Renewable Energy
By taking the measures described above, power consumption was 
reduced by 6.20 million degrees in 2012 against 2011; and 25.20 million 
degrees against 2007 the baseline year. Compared to 2007, power consumption in 2012 was reduced by 12.6% and carbon by 3,850 tons. The 5-year plan for energy saving and carbon reduction in telecomm datacenters will continue and are expect to reach the goal of a 2% power saving each year.
To lower the impact of the business operation on the environment, a 
score of aircon (air conditioning) related energy saving measures have been adopted for the telecomm datacenters including inverters, high heat sensibility, and the use of supplementary cooling by external air. At the end of 2012, total installation of energy saving related capacity was: inverter modules 224 HP , aircon equipment with sensible loads 4,390 RT , high efficiency air-con equipment 1,465 sets (of capacity 2~3 kW respectively), wholly external-air based aircon equipment 708 RT and natural-air-based-and-aircon-supplemented equipment 23 sets. A total capacity of 26.6 kW wind and 154.88kWp solar power generation equipment has been installed.
Waste disposal from the Telecomm datacenters
The scrapped lead-acid battery is a recyclable industrial waste 
regulated by the EPA as. To reduce pollution the recycling and disposal operations are outsourced by joint contract based public auction. The contractor must be a qualified service provider listed on the website of the Recycling Fund Management Board of the EPA to ensure legitimate management and disposal.
All the lead-acid batteries scrapped by each business unit are 
auctioned on site and proper documents for their disposal are filed for audit tracking. There were 41,718 scrapped lead-acid batteries, with a total weight of 1,976,552 kg disposed in 2012. 
Waste Recycling
Recycling can reduce waste and raw material consumption. In 2012, 
the recycling amounts are as follows: 
Computers: 1,993 units
Cell phones: 8,707 units; Communication accessories: 34,224 units.
Batteries: 295,489 Kg
Paper: 403,305 Kg

By 2015, we will exclusively purchase “low-pollution, recyclable, 
and resource-saving” green products and provide related services and 
activities. The definition of comprehensive or exclusive green purchasing is products that are compliant with government and other countries’ green marks and provision of self-proclaimed environmentally friendly products, services, and related activities. This includes the purchase of green products, the implementation of green purchasing by combining corporation and supply chains, the development of green products, and the provision of relevant services and activities. As we are vigorously promoting green purchasing, we have established the following annual green purchasing plans and objectives:Creating a Green Business
During our 15th anniversary publication, we announced: “To Build a Beautiful Sustainable Vision 
2020,” we have set an objective for comprehensive (exclusive) green purchasing by 2015, and for 
active participation in international energy conservation research, as well the exploration of energy conservation and carbon reduction issues and implements corporate social responsibility.
Green Procurement Plan
A Green Building Label
A Green building is academically part of the earth sustainable 
development policy. The “Green Building Promotion Program” 
promulgated by Executive Yuan defines seven environmental assessment indexes regarding buildings, which includes greenness, water conservation, energy saving, the reduction of CO2 emission, the reduction of waste disposal, indoor environment, water resources, and improvement of sewage and garbage disposal. Therefore, with a fifty million construction budget, we will apply for environmentally-friendly and energy-saving green building labels for new buildings and datacenters. Our north branch has applied for diamond-rating green building label candidate certification.The First Green Accommodation in Taiwan
We have renovated some properties into accommodations around 
Taiwan, as a service for publics and welfare of employees. And since 2012, in order to spread the low carbon traveling concept, we have followed the Hotel Carbon Measurement Initiative 1.0 made by World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) and International Tourism Partnership (ITP), to arrange a project that discloses carbon footprint of accommodations, and advocate of bringing self toiletries. We plan to launch the project “Carbon Footprint for Room” in late 2013, and hope to lower the impact of tour done by our staffs.

Article 19 of the “Environmental Education Act” :“Government 
agencies, state-run enterprises and institutions... all employees... shall 
participate in more than four hours of environmental education,” which appropriately echoes Article 15 of “Corporate Social Responsibility Best Practice Principles for TWSE / GTSM Listed Companies”: “Listed Companies should establish a dedicated unit or assign dedicated personnel to environmental management to maintain the system and should hold environment education courses for their managerial officers and other employees on a regular basis.” To comply with these obligations in the future, we will begin implementing the following:
1. Four hour environmental classes for all employees every year.
2. Fusion between environmental education classes and major 
corporate activities. 34 environmental courses were held in 2012 and 2,736 persons enrolled. 
Corporate Volunteer Exchange
Our “CSR Committee” includes an “Environmental Sustainability 
Group” and “Corporate Volunteerism Group,” enabling our colleagues from business locations across Taiwan to engage in environmental education and considerable experience has already been accumulated.
The Chunghwa Telecom corporate volunteers also participated in the 
Taiwan Energy Conservation Patrol initiated by Epson Technology and other corporations. This focuses on increasing energy efficiency within corporate operations and production processes to achieve the objectives of carbon reduction and to mitigate global warming. It is hoped that on-site inspections and the provision of energy conservation advice, given 
to the units inspected, will help us achieve maximum benefit for both 
environmental protection and corporate profit.
Adopt Electric Vehicle
On October of 2012, we signed a 2-year lease for 20 business use 
Luxgen Electric Vehicles. For every kilowatt-hour the electric vehicle can travel 6 kilometers and releases 0.536 kg of CO2e; therefore, 0.089 kg of CO2e per kilowatt-hour is released every kilometer. Compared to similar vehicles, the average gasoline use is 8 km per liter and releases 2.361 kg of CO2e per liter; therefore, 0.295 kg of CO2e per kilowatt-hour is released every kilometer.
After switching over to electric vehicles, we are saving 0.206 kg of 
CO2e per kilometer. Estimating that we travel 2,000 km per month, 
every vehicle is reducing CO2e emissions by 4,944 kg and a total of 
98,880 kg less CO2e emissions for 20 vehicles.
It’s a small step but a big change to the earth if every company 
adopts electric vehicles. Therefore, in order to take responsibility for our earth we plan to increase the use of electric vehicles in our companyStrategy Management Action Response Target70Environmental Information Disclosure

Digital Inclusion to 
Create Shared Value74Based on the information and communications characteristics of 
Chunghwa Telecom, the two major missions of social investments from 
Chunghwa Telecom and the Chunghwa Telecom Foundation are the ”reduction of digital disparity and the creation of digital opportunity”.
Chunghwa Telecom’s commitment on this issue involves diverse 
social investments over five aspects. “Hardware infrastructure” is the foundation for modern people’s communication. “Product or service donation” allows communication technologies to properly utilize their values. “Research, development, and innovation” focuses on assisting disabled persons with sharing convenient communication. “Corporate 
volunteerism” allow our employees to directly utilize their capabilities 
and participate in community building. Meanwhile, “Chunghwa Telecom Foundation” is the pioneer in our endeavor to create digital opportunities.Concentration on Digital Opportunities
The “digital divide” has created unfair conditions in education and employment opportunities. 
Building on the characteristics and core professional capabilities of the telecommunications industry, 
our social investments are focused on “reducing the digital divide” and “creating digital opportunities.” We are also significantly devoted to introducing “corporate volunteers” to participate in localized community services and actively assist with the creation of digital opportunities in local communities.
Six Major Causes of the Digital Gap
The digital divide in today’s society is primarily due to the following:
Geographical gap: a gap that results from people being in urban and 
remote areas.
Economic gap: a gap that results from people having different levels of 
income.
Knowledge gap: a gap that results from different levels of knowledge 
between different groups of people.
Disability gap: a gap that results from the general public and disabled 
persons. 
Health gap: a gap that results from people of different age groups or 
health conditions. 
Gender gap: middle aged and senior women suffer from significant 
disparities when using information and communications services as a result of traditional notions of family care.  
Chunghwa Telecom had proposed many solutions to address these 
digital gaps. In the future, we will actively engage in social innovation to 
address these issues.

Not only are we Taiwan’s most significant composite telecommunications company with networks 
and services across Taiwan and its outer islands. Over the years, we have continued to apply our core capabilities to create concrete values for Taiwanese society and assist people to increase the quality of their lives.
Social Contribution Assessment
We adopted the London Benchmark Group’s (LBG) model to assess 
the utility of social investments, which had been widely used by over 300 
corporations. According to the LBG model:
1. Form targets: community / corporation
2. Activity type (classified by motivations) 
3. Investment value : total monetary value, physical objects, employee 
hours and planning, and management costs 
4. External resource integration: community projects result from other resources
5. Community benefit: project performance assessment for communities
6. Commercial benefit: project performance assessment for commerce
7. Assessment of effects on communities / corporations 
Quantify community investments can help us engaged in optimal 
resource allocation and avoid repetitive resource investment. Thus, 
financial and non-financial investment can be combined effectively, while multitudes of stakeholders can be satisfied at the same time to create more effective social contributions. 
Social Investment Statistics
We started to count our social investment amounts since 2008 in 
order to quantitative our contribution to the society. In 2012, our social investment amount is NT$ 1,493 million, the decrease of total social contribution is because we improved our management by cutting down unnecessary expenditure, and kept all other part as the same as usual. Besides, we add “volunteer cost”

To assist the government with implementing increasing telecommunications availability and 
services, we have also established Chunghwa Telecom Foundation to fulfill the primary missions of 
reducing the digital gap, assisting local cultural industries, and participating in community life. 
Well Use Computer Makes Computer a Good Thing
Chunghwa Telecom Foundation (CTF) encourages the ideologies “well 
used computer makes computer a good thing” and “what is taken from 
the society, being use on the society,” therefore we will always assist anyone who is in need of help with computers.
In 2012, we donated computer equipment to Taitung County to 
improve the community’s problem with lack of digital equipment. We have also donated resources to charitable organizations to help children and the elderly and decrease the digital gap.
While assisting in the improvement of hard drive equipment, we are 
also paying attention to the method users choose to follow by so we can promote the correct attitude to use a computer. Such as cooperating with The Public-Service Association of Taiwan Concern Society to hold internet safety education campaign, we hope to create a friendly environment for digital use.
Click Taiwan
We arrange different types of volunteer plans for each community, in 
2009, CTF  held first “Click Taiwan” project, invited university students to photograph and take video for communities and contribute their own abilities to lead or attend activities in communities. From 2009 to 2012, there already were 162 students cross 23 universities joined the project, went through 47 towns and took over 1,000 minutes of video in Taiwan.
And CTF also held second “Young volunteer project” in 2012, invited 
young men to step into communities which are mostly with insufficient youth. Through these activities, that we hope to encourage young people to visit this beautiful island by their own feet, step by step to learn the 
wonderful view in Taiwan.

Strategy Management Action Response Target77Micro-Industry Lighten Economy 
In 2006, CTF set up virtual and physical channels to help promote 
local industry, but consider the limited scale and human resource, since 
2012, we have gradually turned into micro industry concept to provide solution for local communities.
 “Clicktaiwan.com” was established in 2011, as a marketing platform 
for communities’ products. Through systematic plan and operation, we have built a complete database for local industry, and provide a chance for consumers to know the manufacturers’ background. In the same time, we also issue electric news paper to all our membership, about 30,000 members, to invite more people to support the idea of local industry.

Malaysia Digital Opportunity Center
Because our assistance to APEC member Philippines’ “Digital 
Opportunity Center for Visually Impaired” was very appreciated, the 
Malaysian APEC officer has actively asked us to assist Malaysia to establish the same center.
The center has successfully built and held an opening ceremony 
in Rawang City on September 11, 2012. Malaysia officers, chairman of Association of the Blind, and Taiwan vice ambassador attended the ceremony. So far 3 visually impaired people have completed the training for customer service and 1 operation staff.
EYE Society Innovative Call Center
Cooperation with the Student Resource Center, Tamkang University, 
we have set up EYE Society Innovative Call Center in 2011, and there were 18 visually impaired call center agents and 2 supervisors in 2012. They are respectively responsible for Chunghwa Telecom satisfaction survey and the hotlines of 1999 Taipei City Government.
According to our satisfactory survey, visually impaired agents 
are qualified to Chunghwa Telecom’s standard of customer service, and they also can independently work in hotlines of 1999 without 
help. Therefore, Taipei City held press conference for 1999 Visually 
impaired call group in August, 2012.
Strategy Management Action Response Target78Digital Good Neighbors with New Cloud Version
Through the “Digital Good Neighbors” project we have set up 63 
locations and kept donating hardware and internet service to support a 
public study place.
According to the 2011 domestic survey of family information condition 
state by the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission, Executive Yuan, the domestic non-internet users are higher in females than males as well as elders than other ages. Therefore, when in efforts to reduce the digital gap, we encourage women and the elderly to attend our classes.
The Geng-Hsin Lien–Yuan Educational Fundation in Sanchong District 
in New Taipei City opened an internet course. After completing the course some students are able to manage a blog for their own businesses, providing product information. Similar events are happening in Linbian Township, Pingtung County, the Yongle community encouraged the elderly to form local elder photograph group where they learned how to use digital cameras. Meanwhile they also learned how to use Skype, Facebook and similar social networks. In the digital world, age, occupation, wealth is not a concern, the space is for anyone to learn and use. Project Implementation Results
Chunghwa Telecom’s vision behind initiating the “Digital Good Neighbors” project in 2006 was: allow 
everyone to use opportunities well, and that opportunities can serve well. Over the last several years, 
our employees continued to provide uninterrupted service assistance, and our corporate promise and commitment to creating digital opportunities have won recognition from local authorities and local residents alike.
We have launched the Remote Learning Project in 2009 to provide 
students from remote districts a chance to learn. In 2012, we have built 9 
locations with courses on Tuesday and Thursday evening every week. We encourage anyone in the community to attend so they are able to learn and lead the community to grow with them.
In combination with the idea of digital accompany, the Remote 
Learning Project is not only for education, it is also a spirit companion. We hold many activities to encourage children to explore any future possibility and they are not the only ones that benefit from this program, trade school students also had a chance to experience program and are 
better prepared to enter the society.Remote Learning Shorten the Distance of EducationStrategy Management Action Response Target79Location of Digital Good NeighborsRemote Learning Shorten the Distance of Education

In an ICT society where information communication has become an inseparable part of people’s 
lives, we are committed to building a trouble-free communications environment and share value with 
the people. We will establish comprehensive digital inclusion strategies and promote digital inclusion action plan performance indicators step by step.
Four Aspects of Digital Inclusion Strategy
In our disabled digital inclusion strategy, we leverage ICT together 
with discounted plans to fill the service gap for all the disabled groups. 
We are devoted to the development and provision of barrier free communications equipment oriented to improve their lives, education, and employment. 
The advancement in information and communication services also 
allows us to assist elderly people with chronic disease or those in need of special care. We offer disadvantage groups and low-income group cheap plans and remote assistance for the installation of communications equipment. We also provide the public a sufficient education courses as a learning channel in changing information and communications discipline in every county.
We believe that the provision of information and communications 
services for remote area is not subject to terrain or distance. We continue to enhance the accessibility of our mobile communications network and build dual-routes in remote areas to ensure communication. We will also strengthen mountain and outlying island communications by satellites.
Comprehensive Inclusion Action Plan
We define four aspect of telecom performance assessment according 
to different groups and priorities:
1. For disadvantaged groups: trouble-free communication use, life quality 
improvement, disadvantaged group employment, social change in the community, and enhance image.
2. For low-income groups: easy to use, affordable rates, life quality improvement, social change inside community, equipment utilization, revenue, and enhance image.
3. Public education by telecom equipment and services: course integrity, service course for attentive to customer, course utilization, revenue, social changes in community, and enhance image.
4. Infrastructure improvement in remote areas and outlying islands: basic communications coverage, high-speed wireless broadband coverage, guarantee of smooth communication, improvement of user life, equipment utilization, revenue, enhance image, social change in the community and community environment.
