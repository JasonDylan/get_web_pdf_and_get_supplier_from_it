ISSUESMAPPING OUR CORE ISSUES 
TO THE SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT GOALSIn 2018, AMD made strong progress in four strategic focus areas, 
while continuing to advance a broader scope of initiatives.  
We participated in the first quantitative performance analysis 
against the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals — showing how 
advancing our core issues helps to address global challenges.
DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY  
At AMD, security is a top priority and we are continually working 
to improve the safety of our users as new risks arise. Some AMD 
processors have security features included in the hardware, such 
as Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). 
ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AMD technology advances education, healthcare, scientific 
research and more. In 2018, we launched ten new product families 
in emerging fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence and 
augmented/virtual reality. 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY & CLIMATE CHANGE  
AMD’s 2020 climate goals span supply chain, operations and 
product use, and are approved by the Science Based Targets 
initiative. In 2018, we designed the most energy-efficient  
AMD mobile Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) to date, sourced 
27 million kwh of renewable energy, and sustained supply chain 
energy and emissions well below industry averages.
HUMAN RIGHTS & LABOR ISSUES  
We expanded supplier responsibility initiatives to reach  
100% of direct suppliers, maintained our 100% Corporate  
Equality Index score from the Human Rights Campaign,  
and are proud to be full members of the Responsible  
Business Alliance.4

Dedicated to advancing scientific 
discovery, the University of 
Notre Dame Center for Research 
Computing (CRC) enables 
multidisciplinary research through 
advanced computation, data 
analysis and other digital tools. 
When the CRC decided to add a new 
high-performance computing (HPC) 
cluster, one of the partners they 
turned to was AMD — a provider  
of technologies used to help  
solve some of the world’s  
toughest challenges. zSpace equips today’s classrooms 
to be more adaptable, engaging and 
individualized for students through 
sophisticated, immersive learning 
technologies. Their instructional tools 
enable features like 3D visualization 
and modeling, haptic and touch 
feedback, as well as virtual reality (VR) 
and augmented reality (AR).  
More than 1,000 school districts, 
technical centers, medical schools  
and universities around the globe  
use zSpace.Diagnostic displays play an essential 
role in radiological practices. To help 
doctors provide the best possible 
care to patients, Barco utilized 
AMD’s industry-leading graphics 
solutions when designing their 
powerful new display systems. 
Enabling acute improvements in 
day-to-day medical operations, 
these systems revolutionize 
diagnostic imaging and the 
assessment of patient information 
— enhancing workflow and  
quality of care.

OF INCLUSION
At AMD, we harness our world-class technology 
to take on some of the world’s toughest 
problems. This can’t be done alone. It takes 
a diverse group of voices gathered together — 
every day of the week — to find solutions and 
drive our business growth. We thrive through 
respect for and inclusion of our employees’ 
individual talents, personalities, experiences and 
passions. Differences challenge us in a healthy 
way — and improve our capability to bring the 
benefits of high-performance computing to 
consumers in a more meaningful manner.  
From many voices, we create one  
vision of the future, together. 
Inclusion starts with knowing one another — 
both professionally and personally. In 2018, 
AMD launched our newest resource group for 
employees caring for children, parents and pets; 
we achieved our highest participation among 
employee teams in our annual community  
Day of Service; and again, we earned a 100%  
score on the Human Rights Campaign’s  
Corporate Equality Index. 
We thank our workforce, partners and site 
communities for joining us as we continue  
to deliver technology designed to help solve 
some of the world’s toughest challenges. Susan Moore    Corporate Vice PresidentENABLING TODAY ,
