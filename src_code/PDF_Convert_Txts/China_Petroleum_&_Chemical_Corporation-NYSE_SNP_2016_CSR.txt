Dear friends, 
First of all, on behalf of the Board of Directors of Sinopec 
Corp., I would like to express our heartfelt thanks for your 
attention and support.
2016 marked the beginning of the 13th Five-Year Plan in 
China. Sinopec Corp., guided by new national development 
concepts, formulated the company's 13th Five-Year 
Development Plan, outlining how we implement our five development strategies (value-oriented, innovation-driven, 
integrated resource allocation, open cooperation, and green 
and low-carbon growth) to create competitive advantages in sustainability.
Over the last year, Sinopec Corp. has faced severe 
challenges from low oil prices and the market. However, I am pleased to report that our management teams 
guided our staff to overcome these challenges, achieving 
an outstanding performance. We promoted supply-side structural reform, improving our economic position and 
assets utilisation efficiency, and delivered petroleum 
and petrochemical products to society, building a solid foundation for development. In 2016, our operating revenue 
was RMB 1.93 trillion, profit recorded RMB 79.9 billion and 
we produced 195 million tonnes of refined oil products and 69.96 million tonnes of chemical products. Our declared 
dividends were RMB 30.1 billion to shareholders and we 
paid RMB 316.1 billion in taxes and fees. 
In 2016, we promoted supply-side structural reform. 
We strengthened upstream operations to navigate "the harsh winter" in oil markets, and improved the efficiency 
and reduced high-cost crude oil production. Efficient oil 
exploration and extraction was a top objective in 2016 and we took steps to improve our overall energy structure. We 
increased the natural gas production, producing 21.6 billion 
cubic meters inside China. Fuling shale gas field, China's first large-scale shale gas field, now has an annual capacity 
of 7 billion cubic meters. We also increased natural gas 
supply to the Yangtze River economic belt and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. To meet market demands, our 
downstream companies maintained the medium and high-
end supply of products and quality services. We optimised structure of our products in the oil refining segment, integrating new technology and upgrading the quality of 
our refined oil to ensure oil products supply qualified with 
Beijing VI and  National V emission standards. We also 02
Sinopec 2016 Communication on Progress for Sustainable Developmentbusiness. We also cooperated with relevant international 
industries. Yanbu Aramco Sinopec Refining Company Ltd, 
which is established as a joint venture between Sinopec 
Corp. and Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco), came into operation in 2016. We aspire to achieve localisation 
and win-win cooperation through our business and in 2016 
we cooperated with 14 provinces and cities, promoting natural gas business and driving local economic growth. 
RMB 22.8 billion of social capital was inspired to invest into 
the natural gas pipeline project from Sichuan to East China. Reforms of our marketing company progress smoothly 
and we are pursuing strategic cooperation with the postal 
industry and shipbuilding industry. We are optimising our refinery and petrochemical operations, building production 
bases, and developing medium and high-end products, 
expecting to cooperate with our stakeholders.
We seek new advantages in innovation. In recent years, 
we have made breakthroughs in five areas including 
inventing a series of shale gas exploration and extraction technologies, developing and integrating low-cost 
technologies for exploiting clean oil products, qualifying 
the National V emission standards, developing a series of 
new coal chemical technologies for the industry chain, and 
industrialising a complete set of in-house-technology on ethylene facilities at the million tonnage level, which has 
reached advanced world level. We have also established 
world-class industrial unit applying high efficient and environmental friendly Aromatics Package Technology 
which is of independent intellectual property rights, 
reaching the top level in the world. At the S&T innovation meeting held in 2016, we deployed the future innovation 
plans. We will continue to motivate company-wide 
innovation and develop a new batch of core technologies that can transform our company and inspire new initiatives 
to promote sustainability.
As a corporate global citizen, we are committed to 
performing responsibilities. We put people first, enhance 
our approach to safety management, implement new 
measures to protect employee's rights and interests, aiming to promote decent work. Over the past three years 
we have invested RMB 20.9 billion in Blue Sky and Clear 
Water environmental protection campaign and reduced 
major pollutants emissions, increasing our capacity for 
green development. We value the protection of biological diversity and are working to reduce the negative impact on 
the environment. We welcome supervision from society. We have invested RMB 105 million in infrastructure 
construction, education, health care, industrial assistance, occupational trainings in targeted poverty areas. We 
believe this helps people in poverty-stricken areas and 
promotes sustainability. We has invested RMB 6.58 billion in local community development, culture and education, 
and medical and health care. 
Big enterprise undertakes greater responsibility. Looking 
to the future, during the key period when China builds 
a moderately prosperous society in all respects, we will 
continue to implement our five development strategies and observe basic state policies of energy conservation 
and environmental protection. We will focus on promoting 
supply-side structural reforms, and carrying forward traditions of prudency, circumspection and practicability 
in order to transform development models and adjust 
our development structure, and improve the quality and efficiency of our operations. We see humans as 
aspirational beings and we use that understanding as a 
guiding principle for our development. We will continue 
to undertake responsibility to promote harmonious 
development among enterprises, society and the environment. 
Dear friends, as the Chinese ancient saying goes, "Victory 
is ensured when people pool their strengths; success is secured when people put their heads together". We hope 
that we can jointly take responsibility of our era to promote 
sustainability and contribute to our beautiful homeland.

Pursuing green development Managing pollutant emissions
Sinopec Corp. has improved the production techniques, processes and equipment to control pollutant emissions. 
We recycle flue gas, wastewater and waste residue to bolster circular economy. In cases where wastes cannot be recycled, we use harmless processes to mitigate any adverse impact on the environment. 
Reducing wastewater discharge
In 2016, our subsidiaries upgraded and revamped sewage treatment plants, improving their treatment system, 
introducing an anaerobic denitrification function and installing Advanced Oxidation Process (AOPs) equipment. In areas where water resources are scarce, they installed ancillary sewage recovery equipment and hyperhaline water treatment equipment to meet a zero discharge rate. Our discharge of sewage meets relevant requirements, with a 3.86% decline in COD emissions and a 3.48% decline in ammonia nitrogen compounds.
Reducing flue gas emission
In 2016, we enhanced our prevention and treatment of air pollutants. We strengthened the reconstruction of 
desulphurisation and denitrification by upgrading catalytic cracking, sulphur recovery units, the heating furnaces and coal-fired boilers in our refining subsidiaries to meet ultra-low gas emission requirements. As a result, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions were reduced by 4.07% and 4.53%, respectively.
We formulate a comprehensive treatment plan for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The refining subsidiaries treat flue 
gas by focusing on the storage and blending of organic materials and the loading, wastewater recovery and treatment, and industrial controlled emissions. We use a range of environmental management modules including online monitoring and statistical analysis, and leakage detection and recovery modules to achieve goal. Our sales subsidiaries have also been promoting the revamp of oil depots and service stations to reduce VOC emissions.In October 2016, we concluded our three-year Blue Sky and Clear Water environmental campaign. During the campaign, we implemented 870 projects, investing RMB 20.92 billion. It's estimated that additional 3,400 tonnes of COD, 4,900 tonnes of ammonia nitrogen, 42,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 71,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxide and 25,000 tonnes of VOCs will be reduced annually.
Case studyWhen our natural gas branch deployed the Qingning Gas Transmission 
Pipeline Project (a major gas transmission pipeline connecting Shandong and Jiangsu province with about 553 kilometers), they analysed fauna and flora in national reserves and 9 city and county-level reserves, 7 water conservation districts, 51 ecologically vulnerable rivers, Ecological Red Line Areas, and areas within 500 meters of the project. They then conducted a thorough examination of the pipeline routes, looking at the width of the construction work belt and assessing the construction period to determine which approach would most minimise adverse impacts on the natural environment, vegetation, and wild animals. Protecting biological diversity
Sinopec Corp. complies with all laws and regulations covering the protection of biological diversity such as the Environmental Protection Law. In construction projects that may affect the environment, we evaluate 
their impact by assessing ecological reserves, forests and wetlands as well as fauna and flora, and formulate measures to mitigate or eliminate their impact during the preliminary project appraisal process, construction and operation. In 2016, our subsidiaries assessed biological diversity in major projects, analysed the impact on the fauna and flora in Ecological Red Line Areas, forests and wetlands, and then implemented the environmental friendly project plan. Reducing waste residue disposal
In 2016, we enhanced our waste residue  treatment and disposal. Our oilfield subsidiaries integrated methods to 
prevent slurry falling onto the ground in the process of well drilling, and recycled waste slurry from drilled wells in 
ecologically vulnerable areas. The detritus was utilised for general hardening, brickmaking and hardening roads, realising harmless treatment and resource reuse. The refinery and petrochemical subsidiaries also implemented a sludge drying project. 100% of our waste residue meets all relevant requirements after treatment.

Driving economic development in operating regions 
through beneficial and inclusive actions
In 2016, Sinopec Corp. cultivated a range of special commodities in eight 
provinces, and helped these local products to expand the market through its own channels and drive local economic development.

Our action will boost local economies and contribute to the national economy which, we believe, will facilitate the stable and healthy development of Chinese economy.Each year, as the Spring Festival draws closer, hundreds of thousands 
of migrant workers in the Pearl River Delta take their family members on motorcycles and travel nearly a thousand kilometres to return to their hometown. We implement "Warm Station" public welfare activity to assist those heading home.
