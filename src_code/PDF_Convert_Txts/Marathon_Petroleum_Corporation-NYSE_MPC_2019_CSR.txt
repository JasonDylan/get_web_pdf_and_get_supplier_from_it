About the Cover:
Refining maintenance trainer at MPC’s refinery in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, conducts a tour of the Savage Branch Wildlife Reserve with area students. MPC owns and maintains the 
360-acre reserve, which lies one mile west of the Big Sandy River on the Kentucky/West Virginia border. A team of employees from the refinery fosters strong relationships with 
area schools by offering a variety of educational programs on- and off-site. We invite students to the Savage Branch Wildlife Reserve to learn about pond and forest habitats. While 
exploring these habitats, students discover concepts and processes such as forest succession, habitat requirements, interdependence, life cycles, and decomposition.

DATAA Message from Our CEO
At Marathon Petroleum and MPLX, our commitment to 
sustainability means taking actions that create shared 
value with our many stakeholders – empowering 
people to achieve more, contributing to progress in our 
communities, and conserving resources in our operations. 
In this Sustainability Report, we share how our people 
provide products that enhance life’s possibilities, guided 
by our values of safety and environmental stewardship, 
integrity, respect, inclusion and collaboration. 
As we push to continually improve, our sustainability 
efforts reflect consistency and determination. We have 
reduced our emissions of criteria air pollutants by more 
than 45% since 2002, even as our operations expanded 
over that period. We have reduced our greenhouse gas 
emissions intensity through our ongoing commitment to 
energy efficiency and are the first independent refining 
company in the U.S. to link our progress toward reduction 
goals to executive pay. We are investing $470 million to 
convert our Dickinson, North Dakota, refinery to produce 
renewable diesel fuel, and we continue investing in 
advanced biofuels through our research and development 
subsidiary Virent. To learn more about our approach to 
climate change, I encourage you to review our annual 
Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios report. 
For almost 15 years, we have participated in the U.S. 
EPA ENERGY STAR® program, which recognizes 
facilities that achieve top-quartile energy efficiency and 
overall excellence in environmental compliance. We 
have earned more ENERGY STAR recognitions than 
all other refiners combined, including the prestigious 
ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year award for 2018 
and 2019 and the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year 
– Sustained Excellence award for 2020. We have 
reduced the amount of fresh water we use per unit 
of throughput and continue working toward safer 
workplaces, improving the safety rate in our Refining 
organization by 22% since 2015.In the communities where we operate, our employees 
give their time and talent, and the company matches 
their charitable contributions to eligible nonprofits. We 
quickly joined the fight against COVID-19, donating more 
than a half million N95 masks to nearly 50 health care 
facilities across our operational areas, and the Marathon 
Petroleum Foundation donated $1 million to the American 
Red Cross to help provide disaster relief and support to 
those in crisis during the pandemic and beyond. 
We continue to strengthen our long-standing 
commitment to being a good corporate citizen. This 
year, we finalized our Human Rights Policy, which 
codifies our respect for the human, cultural and legal 
rights of all individuals and communities consistent 
with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. We adopted a Stakeholder Engagement 
Policy, formalizing our recognition of shared value as 
an intentional, proactive approach to working with 
stakeholders for mutual benefit. This report also 
incorporates enhanced transparency to diversity data. 
As our nation contends with many challenges, including 
equality, racial discrimination and social injustice, like 
many organizations, we are charting a path toward 
greater understanding, listening and open dialogue. 
The events of the past several months have been a 
stark reminder that if we want to have hope for a better 
tomorrow – and a better today – we must all stand for 
each other, and we must all stand together. MPC and 
MPLX will continue to stand against racism, intolerance, 
discrimination and hatred of any kind, and we stand 
firmly in support of our employees, customers and 
communities who face inequality and injustice. 
Although we have achieved significant progress, we 
have much more to do. Sustainability is one of the 
strategic pillars that drives our success and continuous 
improvement is not optional— it’s essential. Affordable, 
reliable energy is more important than ever as we work to recover from the economic and health effects of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Petroleum fuels, biofuels, 
petrochemicals and natural gas are the building blocks 
of our modern economy – agriculture, construction, 
manufacturing, retail sales and emergency services all rely 
on these affordable materials and energy sources. With 
each year that goes by, we sharpen our focus on doing 
this important work responsibly, remaining competitive, 
and serving as a valued partner to our stakeholders.
Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum. 
Our 2019 Sustainability Report communicates our 
sustainability strategy and performance in accordance 
with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
metrics. We invite you to read it and welcome your

DATAAN OVERVIEW
Proud to be MPC
For more than 130 years, the people of Marathon 
Petroleum Corporation (MPC) and MPLX have worked 
to reliably provide affordable, abundant and safe energy 
in new and innovation ways. Our vision is to create a 
valued, dynamic energy company that enhances 
life’s possibilities.
Our 60,000-plus employees are at the center of all we 
do. We are the largest petroleum refiner and one of the 
largest natural gas processors in the U.S.
An Integrated Business 
Model
Headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, our fully integrated 
system provides operational flexibility to move crude 
oil, natural gas liquids, renewable fuels, feedstocks 
and petroleum-related products efficiently through our 
distribution network and midstream service businesses in 
the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast regions.
Our uniquely integrated business enables us to respond 
promptly to shifts in market conditions and distinguishes 
us from our competitors. We have access to advantaged 
feedstocks and our logistics system lowers crude 
acquisition costs, increases optionality, and increases 
our speed to market. Our broad market presence creates 
superior product placement options and our nationwide 
marketing channels create significant optimization 
opportunities. Our substantial refining capacity and dock 
infrastructure on the West Coast and Gulf Coast and our 
marine assets, uniquely position us to provide reliable 
supply while allowing for international product placement 
and marine transportation cost optimization.

 MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION 2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION 2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTWe view sustainability at MPC and MPLX  as the 
fundamental process of shared  value  creation, in 
which strategic investment and innovation help our 
society achieve economic growth, environmental 
preservation and resource conservation to 
address the needs of future generatio ns.
We recognize shared value  as an intentional 
and proactive approach to working together 
with all stakeholders for mutual benefit. 
We are committed to accountability to 
stakeholders — including our people, 
business partners, customers, communities, 
governments  and shareholders —  for our 
actions and for operating our businesses 
with a spirit of safety and environmental 
stewardship, integrity, respect, inclusion  and 
collaboration. This is our broad commitment to 
“Stakeholder Engagement.”
Sustainability at MPC  and MPLX  consists of these five areas: 
leading in sustainable energy, conserving natural resources 
and reducing waste, creating shared value and opportunity, 
promoting safety and operating with integrity. 
Our approach to sustainability is defined not only by our 
commitment to comply with all laws and regulations, 
but by our determination to achieve or exceed our 
own rigorous sustainability targets. We believe how 
we conduct our business is just as important as our 
performance. By means of our Operational Exce llence  
Management System  (OEMS) , we strive to  continually 
improve our h ealth, environment, safety, security and 
sustainability performance to maintain our license to 
operate, manage risk, make data-driven decisions  and

DATAIdentification of Material Topics
This report focuses on MPC’s and MPLX’s most significant sustainability topics identified in terms of relative importance to us and our stakeholders in 2019.
We worked with an independent expert  in 2018 to complete a materiality assessment in accordance with SASB and GRI Core reporting guidelines to identify topic areas, 
engage with our stakeholders and prioritize topics relative to our business and stakeholders. Conclusions from the 2018 assessment, together with ongoing extensive internal 
and external stakeholder engagement, peer benchmarking, monitoring of trends and external research, help us evaluate our key impacts, risk s and opportunities, determine our 
topic prioritization and continue to enhance  our sustainability program .

DATAOur Products Enhance 
Life’s Possibilities
We make the everyday necessities of life, from the fuel 
in our vehicles to the paved roads that bring us to our 
loved ones. The petrochemicals we manufacture are 
used in making vehicle components, clothing, material in 
our phones, electronic equipment, hospital equipment, 
furniture, insulation material, adhesives, paints and 
inks, helmets and other protective gear. Virtually every 
product and service the world uses is better and more 
affordable because of  the products we manufacture.
• Feeding the World  – Wherever large-scale 
agriculture takes place, petroleum fuels make it 
possible to plow, plant, fertilize, harvest and transport 
food to where it’s needed. Our products help  elevate 
communities out of poverty and into prosperity. 
• Building Our World  – Whether building homes and 
workplaces or bridges and cell towers, construction 
projects rely on petroleum to not only run cranes, 
backhoes, cement trucks and generators , but also 
for building materials including insulation, roofing 
shingles, paint  and vinyl siding .
• Putting Everything within Your Reach  – If you 
order items for delivery , or go to stores to find 
them full of merchandise, petroleum fuels make it 
possible. Almost everything we buy comes to us 
through a combination of trucks, planes, trains and 
marine vessels powered by petroleum fuels.
Throughout our company’s history, we have adapted 
and evolved to meet society’s changing needs. We 
will continue to address the complex challenges of 
sustainably providing affordable, abundant and reliable 
sources of energy, including renewable fuels.

DATAPutting Our Sustainable Energy to Work
The 2030 target builds on our years-long commitment to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations  and products . Additional focus areas to achieve the 2030 goal include 
expanding our energy efficiency program, reducing methane emissions and increasing use of renewable energy. We have outlined a number of these initiatives in our 2019 
Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios Report, available on our website, https://www.marathonpetroleum.com . We are committed to reassessing our GHG emissions goal 
as achievements toward GHG emissions intensity reductions are realized.
Lower carbon intensity of our operations and the products we process
METHANE REDUCTION
As part of a first-of-its-kind settlement agreement 
with the EPA, we innovatively redesigned pipeline 
launchers and receiver stations to minimize emissions 
of methane and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
each time they are opened as part of required 
operation. We are utilizing mobile compressors to 
recover gases vented from a launcher and receiver 
station that were previously required to be flared. 
MPLX has shared its innovative emission reduction 
solutions with hundreds of  individuals via in-person 
trainings and our royalty-free patents  are readily 
available to the public. These launcher and receiver 
station best management practices are anticipated 
to reduce emissions by as much as 85 percent. As 
part of our settlement agreement, we also adopted 
a stringent LDAR (leak detection and repair) program 
at our gas processing and fractionation plants. 
Since 2016, we have reduced our fugitive methane 
emissions intensity by approximately 30%. In 
addition, we are phasing out high-bleed pneumatic 
controllers at our compressor stations.NATURAL GAS 
Since 2015, we have invested more than 
$17 billion to acquire and increase our natural 
gas assets. Additional deployment of natural 
gas resources promotes coal-to-gas switching , 
which reduces emissions from electricity 
generation by approximately 50%  and provides  
immediate cost -effective carbon reductions.SMARTSTART® VAPOR RECOVERY
Vapor Recovery Units (VRUs) recover 
vapors from trucks as they are loaded with 
fuel at terminal s. By installing continuous 
emission monitors (CE Ms) equipped with 
SmartStart® processing equipment, the 
VRUs operate only while loading , saving 
power and decreasing emissions. Across 
45 MPLX terminals in 2019, we avoided 
16,380 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
EPA’S SMARTWAY PROGRAM 
As a partner company in EPA’s 
SmartWay Transport program, we 
improved transportation efficiency in 
2019, resulting  in a 10.9% increase in 
miles per gallon and a 9.8% reduction in 
carbon dioxide (CO2) grams per mile.14

LOS ANGELES REFINERY INTEGRATION AND COMPLIANCE
The Los Angeles Refinery Integration and Compliance project in California physically connected two 
adjacent  refineries, thereby increasing energy efficiency and avoiding  70,000 tonnes of CO2e emissions 
per year, roughly the same as removing more than 11,800 homes’ electricity use for o ne year.
The project’s ongoing emissions reduction has come from linking adjacent refining facilities through 
interconnecting pipelines, allowing them to work together as an integrated refinery and retire the fluid 
catalytic cracking unit at one of the facilities.
BIOCRUDE
Our partnership with Fulcrum  Bioenergy, Inc. will 
allow us to process 800 barrels per day of feedstocks

Water Use and Conservation
We recognize that w ater is essential to the environment and 
has a variety of critical roles in society . One of these roles is 
in petroleum refining, which uses water for steam, process 
cooling and other process uses, such as operating wet gas 
scrubbers for environmental compliance. Our MPLX gas 
processing plants are designed to use little to no water in 
their routine operations. Instead of using steam for heating 
and water for cooling, nearly all our plants have hot oil 
heaters that transfer heat to the process and air-cooling 
units that circulate hot product through air-cooled radiators.  
These measures eliminate the need for cooling towers and 
steam boilers that rely on fresh water.
4 new MPLX  gas processing  
plants with a combined capacity of  
800 million standard cubic feet per 
day – zero  freshwater useFour of MPC’s refineries are located in water-stressed 
regions as defined by the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) and World Resource Institute assessment 
tools. Through our commitment to environmental 
stewardship, we continually evaluate opportunities to 
conserve water and manage our use of this shared 
resource in the communities where we operate. 
We withdraw water from rivers, lakes, wells and 
municipal water treatment plants. Our recent 
conservation efforts have targeted reduc ing our 
water use , focusing on sourcing alternatives and 
opportunities for water reuse and recycling. We 
purchase recycled and treated wastewater at certain 
refineries to reduce withdrawals of fresh water. We also collect condensate from steam – which we use 
in our processes or to power equipment – and reuse  
a portion of this water for further steam production. 
The water in our evaporative cooling towers is reused 
in several cycles to minimize freshwater additions, and 
wastewater at certain facilities is treated and recycled 
back to processes. Additionally, we routinely examine 
our water pipes and valves to determine if repairs are 
needed to prevent leaks and steam losses.

DATARefining Focus on Water Program 
In 2019, we prepared to launch  our Focus on Water 
program and began implementation in early 2020. This 
initiative, sponsored by our Executive Vice President 
of Refining, will help our refineries continue to assess 
their water use, recognize and mitigate water risks, and 
identify opportunities to reduce water demand. 
With corporate oversight, each refinery is developing its 
own water balance, which accounts for a facility’s water 
intakes, distribution, use, discharge and consumption. 
Finalizing these balances will allow standardized water 
monitoring and reporting to begin at all sites. Monitoring 
will increase the transparency of water distribution within 
refineries and permit benchmarking that allows us to 
establish targets and goals for each facility. 
Our Focus on Water program supports our commitment 
to reduce freshwater withdrawals and incorporates 
reporting guidelines of the international Task Force on 
Climate- related Financial Disclosures and the GRI , which 
address several water-related metrics such as water 
intensity. Additionally, we regularly participate in industry 
trade groups where we can work with our peers to 
develop and share best practices. Our water intensity, 
defined as the number of barrels of water needed to 
process each barrel of crude oil, averages about 0.9 
barrels of water across our refineries. This measurement 
is among several key performance indicators (KPIs) 
being developed for facilities under the program:• Water recycling and reuse KPIs
 —Percentage of steam condensate recovered
 —Percentage of water demand from recycled and 
reused water
• Cooling tower and boiler KPIs
 —Number of cooling tower cycles per tower
We have initiated a pilot program at our Los Angeles 
refinery, which will establish a standard water 
management framework to apply to all refineries.
Refining Wastewater Management
The advanced membrane bioreactor at our Detroit 
refinery, which is part of the process of recycling 
wastewater , was o ne of the first of its kind to be used 
in North America with refinery  effluent . Across our 
other refineries, we operate 10 biological treatment 
plants and five pre-treatment facilities. Water not 
consumed in refining processes is collected at these 
on-site  facilities to be treated and then discharged. 
Fully treated water goes to a surface body of water, 
such as a river, lake or bay. Partially treated water 
is discharged to p ublicly owned treatment works 
for further treatment. Our wastewater treatment 
facilities are operated and maintained to meet the 
strict environmental requirements in our National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System or industrial 
pre-treatment permits. To ensure our discharges meet or exceed the requirements, we conduct internal testing 
and monitoring beyond what is required by the permits. 
Additionally, operating upsets or incidents are promptly 
investigated, a report is prepared for management 
review, and corrective actions are taken to minimize the 
risk of a reoccurrence.

DATAWater Reuse  and Recycling at O ur Refineries
Our refineries collectively saved hundreds of millions of gallons in municipal fresh water in 2019 through traditional approaches to water reuse, such as capturing steam 
condensate, as well as  unique, site-specific recycling projects.
Detroit r efinery saved almost 
83 million 
gallons in freshwater withdrawals 
from municipal water supply  in 2019
This refinery recycled almost 83 million gallons of 
wastewater in 2019. The site combines reverse 
osmosis with the advanced membrane bioreactor  
treatment process to remove contaminants from 
wastewater that would otherwise be discharged 
from the refinery. After some additional treatment, 
the treated water is then recycled to the boiler water 
treatment system and used to generate  steam. 
Kenai r efinery saved  more than
1 million  
gallons of water in 2019 through 
wastewater outfall flow  project
A project commissioned in the fall of 2019 reduced 
wastewater outfall flow. The refinery  installed a 
wastewater cooling exchanger that uses air instead 
of well water, thereby reducing water use and 
discharge flow. This saved more than 1 million 
gallons of water during the last two months of 2019 
alone.Galveston Bay r efinery saving more than
70 million  
gallons of water per year  
A series of steam recovery projects strengthened 
this refinery’s water conservation, reduced its 
energy use and garnered national recognition from 
the EPA in 2019. 
• At the end of 2019, the refinery launched 
initiative s that replaced 763 steam traps, 
and targeted energy reduction opportunities, 
including steam recovery. These combined 
efforts conserve water at a rate equal to more 
than 70 million gallons p er year.  
• The EPA showcased a steam project at the 
refinery’s sulfur recovery unit during a 2019 
webinar for companies that earned the EPA’s 
ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year award. This 
project helped decrease steam consumption 
at our refinery by 42,000 pounds per hour 
and avoids more than 27,000 tonnes of CO2e 
emissions annually.
• The gains from steam recovery are also helping 
to lower the refinery’s energy intensity, which 
refers to its energy consumption compared to 
refineries of similar size. The EPA recognized the 
refinery at the 2019 ENERGY STAR® Industrial 
Partner and Focus Meetings for decreasing its 
energy intensity by almost 2%.Los Angeles r efinery saved more tha n
91 million  
gallons of water in 2019
This refinery decreased its freshwater withdrawals 
from the municipal water supply in 2019 by using a 
new anti-scaling product. This made it possible to 
increase the number of times water could be cycled 
back through five of the refinery’s evaporative 
cooling towers, reducing the amount of make -up 
water required. Using this product saved more than 
91 million gallons of water during the year.
Salt Lake City r efinery saved
31 million  
gallons of city water in 2019
Two water-cooled heat exchangers that were 
connected to a closed-loop, circulating water 
system have lowered the refinery’s use of municipal 
fresh water. Previously, city water would pass 
through the exchangers a single time and be 
discharged instead of being re-used. In 2019, the 
circulating system reduced the refinery’s withdrawal 
of city water by 31 million  gallons and consequently 
lowered its wastewater effluent disc harge rate.

Biodiversity
MPC  and MPLX  employ multiple proactive 
measures to protect plant and animal species 
and preserve their natural habitats.
Our Operational Excellence Management System 
(OEMS) , overseen by our Vice President of 
Environment, Safe ty and Security , provides the 
procedural framework to ensure we account for 
the potential effects of our activities on ecosystems 
and prepare necessary mitigation procedures. Our 
approach also involves ongoing collaboration with 
applicable state and federal regulatory agencies, 
including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land 
Management and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Our pledge to preserve biodiversity extends to 
educating our employees and the communities where 
we operate, such as through our involvement in the 
Wildlife Habitat Council’s (WHC) land certification 
program. The WHC  provides the only voluntary 
sustainability standard for biodiversity enhancement 
and conservation education activities on corporate 
lands. We own and manage more than 1, 300 acres 
of WHC-certified habitat land at multiple locations, 
which support a variety of informational programs for 
students, community residents and employees.
Wildlife Habitat Awareness
The  23 WHC -certified habitat sites
we owned and maintained in 2019 covered more than
1,300 acres,
including a 360-acre wildlife reserve.
A 2.4-acre  plot at our corporate headquarters campus in Findlay, Ohio, is among our newest examples 
of WHC-certified habitat. Our work to fully develop this campus area in recent years was rewarded in 
January 2020  with certification from the WHC, which recognized our landscaping and special features to 
attract pollinators and birds, such as nest boxes for the nesting season.
Our Savage Branch Wildlife Reserve near our Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery consists of 360 acres and is 
WHC-certified. In 2019, we  provided educational opportunities to more than 1,100 students from regional 
elementary schools. Environmental experts from the refinery, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife 
and the Kentucky Division of Forestry presented lessons that involved hiking, planting native vegetation and 
identifying plant and animal species in the reserve’s forest, pond/wetland and grassland habitats.
Our five WHC-certified habitat sites near the Robinson, Illinois  refinery, which total 226 acres, also served as outdoor 
classrooms in 2019. Refinery representatives organized activities for more than 300 elementary school students, 
donating butterfly kits, binoculars and clipboards. Middle and high schools, as well as a local college, also used 
habitat areas, and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency held its 2019 Intern Nature Day at one of the sites.

DATAConsideration of Biodiversity Impacts
Our MPLX pipeline construction and maintenance 
projects require thorough evaluations of potential 
biodiversity impacts before commencing work. Our 
policies and practices for pipeline siting, construction 
and operation generally align with the International 
Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards on 
Environmental and Social Sustainability (Standards 
1, 3, 4 and 6). For pipeline construction, we begin 
by determining the optimal route, considering these 
biodiversity impact factors:
• Areas of high ecological consequence
• Restrictions, such as known wildlife habitats, 
wetlands and archeological sites
• Undeveloped, greenfield sites versus existing 
rights of way
• Public lands, including parks, nature preserves and 
wildlife refuges
• Waterways and floodplains
For all activities involving disturbance to soils, we 
implement stormwater management controls to minimize 
the impact to lakes, rivers, streams and other bodies 
of water. Controls are implemented through the timely 
and informed application of Best Management Practices 
(BMPs) to foster compliance with federal, state and local 
stormwater pollution control requirements and in keeping 
with our commitment to environmental responsibility.  
BMPs cover preconstruction planning, temporary and 
permanent erosion control measures, and stream and 
wetland crossing processes.
Construction also integrates environmental reviews, 
which include field studies to examine natural 
resources and land use within our proposed project footprints. Both new and maintenance projects near 
sensitive habitats can necessitate endangered species 
surveys. The results dictate project decisions, including 
the execution methods selected  and whether to retain, 
remove or introduce vegetation to benefit any identified 
animal populations.  
To protect  ecosystems from releases of materials, we 
implement comprehensive pollution prevention and 
incident response programs. In the event a release 
occur s, we take steps to mitigate the effects and 
develop corrective measures.  See Pages 56 and 57  for 
a description of our emergency response capabilities.
In Illinois, we voluntarily changed our 
technique for replacing a pipeline section 
that crossed a creek to prevent any harm 
to endangered Eastern Sand Darter fish. 
We originally received a permit to complete 
an open-trench cut of the creek to replace 
the pipeline. After learning this species was 
present, we worked proactively with the state 
to use horizontal directional drilling, allowing 
us to run the pipeline under the creek to avoid 
working in the water and impacting the fish.
Along Missouri’s Gasconade River, we 
coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service to make certain our pipeline 
maintenance project did not adversely 
affect endangered mussels downstream of 
our project area. We voluntarily conducted 
a mussel survey prior to completing the 
maintenance activity, which confirmed no 
mussels were present in the project area.

DATARestoration of Natural Habitats
After pipelines are installed, disturbed areas are graded 
to pre-construction contours as much as possible. 
We restore the land to equivalent capability, planting 
vegetation as necessary, and continue to manage 
the land to sustain growth. Within MPLX , this can 
also involve a weed management plan to minimize 
the spread of invasive weeds in our operational areas 
and maintain native species on our rights of way. 
When constructing projects in rural areas, we strive to 
accommodate the resumption of agricultural activities 
after construction. We also monitor wetland and 
watercourse crossing sites to confirm they are fully 
restored and functioning.  Protection of Endangered Species
In addition to project plans, MPC  and MPLX  also 
actively incorporate species preservation into various 
operational approaches. In several instances, we have 
voluntarily adopted changes, both temporary and 
permanent, to prioritize endangered species and their 
critical habitats. 
In Missouri, we chose to restore vegetation 
to the site of a pipeline replacement project 
even though endangered species surveys 
did not mandate this step. The project 
required clearing trees along the Missouri 
River near the community of Chesterfield 
in a known habitat for the endangered 
Indiana Bat and Northern Long-Eared 
Bat. Surveys before tree clearing began 
did not detect these bats, which meant 
revegetating the area would not be 
required. We coordinated with the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service to restore vegetation, 
however, because of the land’s potential as 
a future habitat.Our emphasis on limiting our environmental 
impacts is exemplified at sea as well as on 
land. Our oil tankers that operate in the San 
Francisco Bay area and off the S outhern 
California coast have been honored for their 
high level of participation in a federal program 
to protect endangered whales. The National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) oversees a voluntary, vessel speed 
reduction program to lower the risk of fatally 
striking blue, fin and humpback whales that 
migrate to these areas in the summer and fall 
to feed. We received NOAA’s Gold  Award for 
our voluntary actions in 2019, which included 
proactively adding slower-speed instructions 
to the voyage orders of our chartered vessels 
to further support the safety of the whales. 
MPLX  utilizes an Avian Protection Plan to 
guard against interfering with the seasonal 
patterns of migratory birds. This plan 
corresponds with legal requirements of the 
Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird 
Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection 
Act and other regulations for state-designated 
special species of concern. The provisions 
prohibit site disturbances, such as clearing 
vegetation, during the breeding and nesting 
seasons of designated species. If proposed 
projects are likely to coincide with these time 
periods, then the plan mandates developing 
mitigation strategies.

Waste
At MPC  and MPLX , we seek to minimize waste 
generation, encourage recycling of the waste 
that is generated and appropriately dispose of 
the remaining waste.  Prevention of p ollution and 
resource conservation is a stated commitment in our 
corporate policies . 
Waste minimization is a business priority allowing 
for financial and environmental benefits to both 
the company and the communities we call home. 
Therefore, we continually look to improve our 
maintenance and operations activities to reduce the 
volume of waste generated. 
We carefully screen our vendors to ensure they meet 
our rigorous standards for recycled and disposed 
waste. This vetting program, including compliance with 
environmental laws and regulations, is called our Waste 
Management Vendor Approval Program.

DATAInvesting in Partnerships
Waste to Fuel.  MPC and Fulcrum Sierra Biofuels, LLC 
have partnered together to turn municipal waste into 
low-carbon transportation fuels, thereby converting 
250,000 tons/year of waste into useable product. 
Fulcrum’s plant in Reno, Nevada will utilize a gasification 
process to turn sorted, municipal trash into a synthesis 
gas (syngas). The syngas will then enter a process to form 
a biocrude  product that MPC plans to  introduce into its 
refining process to produce low-carbon transportation 
fuel. In 2019, the refinery project team progressed a 
$14 million  project to receive and process Fulcrum’s 
production of 800 barrels per day. In addition to the waste 
minimization advantages of this process, the low-carbon 
fuel produced will also avoid an estimated 69,000 tonnes 
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions per year 
compared to traditional fuel alternatives. In addition to our 
focus on reducing our overall waste to landfill, this initiative 
directly supports our goal to reduce the carbon intensity 
of fuels and comply with EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard 
and the California Air Resources Board’s low carbon 
fuel standard.

continue to partner together to convert oil tank waste into 
cement, thereby reducing ash waste to landfills by 4,204 
tons in 2019 and a total of 36,919 tons since 2014. The 
oil tank cleaning process produces a residual waste that 
can be used to fire kilns for the manufacturing of cement, 
a process that does not produce ash like traditional oil 
waste incineration . In addition, our oil waste that was 
burned in the kiln avoided an estimated 81 ,000 tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent  (CO2e) emissions since 2014 
compared to traditional cement kiln fuels.Catalyst Metals Reclamation.  MPC and its strategic 
partner, AMG Vanadium (AMG), work together to 
improve the environment by minimizing waste and 
reducing GHG emissions. In 2019, in lieu of landfill 
disposal, MPC delivered 5,3 00 tons of spent catalyst to 
AMG. AMG extracted the vanadium and other valuable 
metals to produce ferrovanadium and a ferronickel 
molybdenum alloy , which are sold to the steel industry. 
This reclamation process produces 41,500 fewer metric 
tonnes of CO2e emissions than the traditional steel 
manufacturing process.

DATAApplying Sustainability to Soil Remediation 
Environmental remediation removes contaminants from water and soil to protect 
human health and restore the environment. However, even remediation activities 
can create an environmental footprint. For this reason, MPC is further enhancing 
our remediation program by integrating a sustainability assessment to maximize 
the net environmental and social benefits of cleanup projects. This assessment 
evaluates ways of reducing a project’s anticipated impact by thoughtfully 
considering greenhouse gases , air emissions, energy use, waste, water use and 
raw materials , as well as natural treatment systems, such as constructed wetlands 
that decrease  the need for more energy-intensive actions. 
For example, rather than use soil remediation techniques that utilize landfill disposal 
methods, MPC partnered with the landowner and regulators at a site in Alaska 
to implement an innovative phytoremediation method to remove contaminants, 
thereby cleaning the soil and groundwater and avoiding landfill waste. Over a span 
of three acres, we planted 550 native balsam poplar trees inoculated with a specific 
bacteria that can degrade contaminants in the soil. Through this process, the trees 
will absorb groundwater and treat it through their natural processes, shortening the 
need for a mechanical system by as much as seven years. This revised strategy 
could reduce CO2e emissions during the project’s lifecycle by an estimated 90 
tonnes, which is nearly equal to the annual average energy use of 11 homes.

Spill Prevention
Protecting our people and the environment we share 
has been a priority for us throughout our 132-year 
history. We are committed to operating our vessels, 
pipelines, and manufacturing and processing facilities  
safely and responsibly. We safeguard the environment 
through our operational practices and technology with 
the goal of zero spills. 
Pipeline i ntegrity m anagement and 
damage p revention programs focus on 
zero spills
MPLX  subsidiary Marathon Pipe Line LLC (MPL) uses  
comprehensive risk-based integrity management 
practices to ensure the safety of the facilities and 
pipelines we operate. Our Integrity Management 
Program utilizes state-of-the-art inspection methods 
and evolves continuously to allow for the adoption of 
new technologies and industry-leading practices. Our 
skilled engineers devote significant time serv ing on 
industry committees tasked with improving pipeline 
integrity standards , and we invest in the research and 
deployment of advanced technology to continuously 
improve our performance. In-line inspection tools 
enable us to closely examine the insides of pipelines 
using advanced imaging technologies,  provid ing useful 
data to identify corrosion, cracking, dents , or damage 
caused by third parties or weather before a leak or spill 
occurs . 
Through technological innovation , we are better able to 
protect the integrity of our system, upholding our core 
value of safety and environmental stewardship. MPL embarked on a multiyear journey, investing 
millions of dollars to drive a step-change improvement 
to in-line inspection crack detection technology. We 
helped develop the industry’s first-ever hook crack 
sizing specification and increased the probability 
of detecting critical seam issues to 99% from 90% 
previously.  We successfully applied this new technology 
to MPL pipelines throughout the year. We allowed 
this tool to be marketed by the third-party vendor so 
that the entire pipeline industry can benefit from the 
enhanced technology. 
Another critical program to prevent spills is MPL ’s 
waterway crossing program. We perform w aterway 
crossing inspections to examine pipelines under some 
streams, rivers and lakes. MPL advanced the use of 
high-resolution sonar for precise waterway crossing 
inspection and repair during flood events. Expanding 
the use of this new technology provides more complete 
and accurate information for our i ntegrity engineers  to 
assess appropriate inspection intervals and repairs.  
To ensure our pipelines are not impacted by third-
party damage , MPL continually educates the public 
about  the national “ 811 Call Before You Dig”  program 
and implements a variety of programs to educate the 
public and our landowners about  where our pipelines 
are located. Our skilled , trained technicians responded 
to nearly 165,000 811 calls  in 2019. Additionally, we 
conduct weekly aerial inspections of our pipeline rights 
of way, weather permitting, to identify and report 
unauthorized excavation activities near our pipelines. 
We’re now putting extra eyes in the skies with cameras 
attached to some of the aerial patrol planes, so we 
can capture optical imagery of our pipelines on each 
flight.  Through change -detection technology, we are 
working on a project that will enable  automatic alerts 
to changes on the rights of way that could affect safe 
operation of our pipelines.

Air Quality and  Emissions
Our commitment to improving air quality begins at 
our facilities and extends to the transportation fuels 
we produce. We have a comprehensive approach to 
improving air quality that targets lowering emissions 
of criteria pollutants, reducing flaring at our refineries, 
minimizing fugitive emissions, and producing cleaner-
burning fuels.Fuels Compliance
MPC has made significant investments in its facilities 
to ensure our fuels meet stringent sulfur, benzene 
and lead requirements. As a result, our transportation 
fuels no longer contain lead , and our 2019 fuels 
complied with the annual and per-gallon sulfur and 
benzene U.S. EPA standards. Lower benzene and 
sulfur in fuel translates to cleaner air, in part because 
of improved vehicle emission control technology. MPC 
has invested  approximately  $1 billion to reduce sulfur 
in our gasoline to meet U.S. EPA Tier 3 standards.  We 
are also investing roughly $470 million to produce renewable diesel at our Dickinson, North Dakota facility, 
which will primarily serve the California low-carbon 
fuel market.
As we further enhance our fuels, we provide the public 
access to health and safety information about our 
products.  Safety data sheets and product labels are 
available on the websites of MPC and our Speedway 
retail subsidiary to provide guidance on handling, 
storing and disposing of our products. The safety data 
sheets also contain a phone number the public can call 
to address any product questions or concerns.

DATAHuman Rights
MPC  and MPLX  have  a long-standing commitment to 
human rights, and in 2020 we adopted a new Human 
Rights Policy to complement the responsibilities set 
forth in our Code of Business Conduct. Our policy 
describes our obligation to respect the rights of our 
employees and members of the communities where 
we operate, and provides  guidance on managing 
this important obligation , including conducting due 
diligence and remediating human rights impacts. 
We apply  the same expectations to  our suppliers, 
contractors and other business partners.
We support the goals and principles of the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Our commitment extends to the fair treatment and 
meaningful involvement of all people, including 
indigenous people, regardless of race, color, gender, 
gender identity, national origin, sexual orientation or 
income level. 
Our Human Rights Policy also expressly states our 
support for the Voluntary Principles on Security and 
Human Rights, a collaborative multistakeholder initiative 
guiding companies on providing security for their 
operations while respecting human rights. Accordingly, 
we regularly perform risk assessments to continually 
improve our security processes and evaluate our 
relationships with public and private security providers. 
In addition, our employees or contractors who oversee 
the security of our assets receive training to ensure 
conduct is consistent with the Voluntary Principles and 
the protection of human rights. 
Diversity and Inclusion
Our company -wide Diversity and Inclusion (D&I ) 
program is managed by a dedicated D&I Office 
team  and supported by leadership. Our program is 
based on our three-pillar D&I strategy. The strategy 
focuses on understanding the benefits of diverse 
perspectives, increasing diversity across the 
organization and recognizing that cultural inclusion is 
an ongoing process.
Building Awareness
A truly inclusive and collaborative work environment is developed through an appreciation of the similarities 
and differences of every individual and acknowledging the value added by diverse perspectives. We 
regularly host D&I workshops and employee-led panels, and also develop training programs, often with the 
support of our Employee Network G roups . In our communities, we engage in outreach and participate in 
community-led diversity celebrations and educational events.
Increasing Representation
Increasing diverse  representation throughout our workforce is our primary D&I objective, and we vigilantly 
monitor our progress, provide quarterly updates and engage in ongoing dialogue with our leadership team. 
As part of our Diversity Improvement Plan launched in 2019 , we enhanced our talent acquisition practices to 
reflect our commitment to diverse candidates in the hiring process. With the support of executive leaders, 
we extended our balanced slate approach to all positions at manager level and higher, which means 
that we use our best efforts to include at least one qualified individual who is female or from a racial or 
ethnic minority group in the final candidate pool. These efforts are coupled with additional hiring process 
enhancements, such as providing training to avoid unconscious bias in hiring, ensuring diversity on all hiring 
and interviewing teams, requiring internal and external postings of positions, and leveraging our Employee 
Network Groups.
Ensuring Success
To ensure success , we reinforce our value of inclusion through active engagement from our leaders, who 
provide individual mentoring to  employees. We also provide peer support and development programs, and 
review participation rates to avoid disparate representation. Our Employee Networks are critical contributors 
to our employees feeling engaged and included, and we have incorporated communications from our 
networks into the onboarding process for new employees. We also periodically perform targeted D&I 
assessments to identify areas for improvement within the organization.Our Three D&I  Pillars
MPC enforces Human Resources policies to protect and support employees, such as anti-discrimination, 
anti-harassment,  drug and alcohol use, workplace violence and reasonable accommodation policies. We do 
this, in part, by periodically communicating about these policies and requiring supervisors and employees to 
complete tailored, web-based trainings on these issues.35

We provide a broad range of leadership training 
opportunities to support the development of leaders at 
all levels. Our programs, which are offered across the 
organization, including Speedway LLC, are a blended 
approach of business and leadership content, with 
many featuring world-class external faculty. We utilize 
various learning modalities, such as visual, audio, 
print, tactile, interactive, kinesthetic, experiential and 
leader-teaching-leader to address and engage different 
learning styles. We believe networking and access 
to our executive team are  a key leadership success 
factor, and we incorporate these opportunities into all 
of our programs . In 2019, there were 740 participants in 
36 MPC Development Programs.

DATAEmployee Development
Mentorship Program. We are refreshing our 
mentorship program, which we expect to launch in 
2020. We have conducted interviews with a variety of 
stakeholders, including gathering information from our 
Employee Networks, to understand the general needs 
and considerations for building an effective program 
that serves to retain and engage our employees for 
long-term success.
Performance Accountability Process . We encourage 
our employees to take ownership of their careers at 
MPC. Recognizing that setting clear expectations and 
providing constructive feedback is critical for career 
development, we promote ongoing dialogue with 
supervisors, and 100% of our salaried exempt and 
salaried nonexempt employees as of Sept.  30 each year 
participate in our annual performance re view proces s.
Constructive  
Feedback
Goal Setting/Max 5
Clear Expectations
Performance 
DevelopmentTHROUGHOUT THE YEAROur performance development process is designed 
to help employees focus on the core aspects of their 
job, clearly understand expectations, and balance 
results (what gets done) and behaviors (how it gets 
done). Supervisors and employees establish no more 
than five performance commitments annually, which 
we refer to as “Max 5 Goals,” that encompass the 
employee’s most important job responsibilities. We 
emphasize collaboration with supervisors to set clear 
metric targets, and employees are accountable for their 
results. At the end of the performance cycle, employees 
receive a scorecard that summarizes results, including 
an assessment of performance in terms of values, 
knowledge and competencies.
Employees and supervisors also are expected to 
discuss career development goals. Further linking 
the performance process to career advancement, 
supervisors and managers  are required to include 
a specific goal related to demonstrating effective 
leadership as part of their Max 5 Goals.
We directly link compensation to performance to 
appropriately reward high performers and identify 
candidates for promotion opportunities.  
Compensation and Benefits
To ensure we are offering competitive pay packages 
in our recruitment and retention efforts, we annually 
benchmark compensation, including base salaries, 
bonus levels and equity targets. Our annual bonus 
program is a critical component of our compensation, 
as it provides individual reward for MPC’s achievement 
against preset financial and operational goals, 
encouraging a sense of employee ownership. We have 
two annual bonus programs designed to align our 
employees’ discretionary compensation with company 
performance : one for salaried exempt and salaried nonexempt employees, and one for hourly employees.  
Employees in our Officer-level pay grades, as well as 
those in our top six pay grades below the Officer level, 
are eligible to receive long-term equity incentive awards 
as part of their compensation.
Nearly 100%  of our  
employees  participate  
in our annual bonus programs  
(excluding Speedway)
We offer comprehensive benefits, including medical, 
dental and vision insurance for our employees, their 
spouses or domestic partners, and their dependents. 
We also provide retirement programs, life insurance, 
education assistance, family assistance, short-term 
disability and paid vacation and sick time. For 
2019, following our combination with Andeavor, we 
enhanced several of our benefits programs to reflect 
our larger, coast-to-coast organization.  We increased 
the maximum accrual cap for vacation banks to two  
times the employee’s annual vacation benefit. This 
means an employee whose annual vacation benefit is 
four weeks can accrue up to e ight weeks of vacation 
in their vacation bank. We also doubled the number of 
college and trade school scholarships offered to the 
high school senior children of our employees through 
the Marathon Petroleum Scholars Program. In addition, 
we increased our paid parental leave benefit to eight  
weeks for birth mothers and four  weeks for non birth 
parents, including adoptive and foster parents. Both 
full-time and part-time employees are eligible for this 
benefit, meaning that, in 2019, 99% of our employees 
were eligible for paid parental leave. Parents who both 
work for the company are each eligible for a parental 
pay benefit.39

Our Communities
Community Engagement
We are proud of the positive relationships we have built 
with our local community stakeholders. At each of our 
sites, we are focused on understanding our stakeholders’ 
goals, projects and concerns, and incorporating 
stakeholder feedback into our business strategies to 
create shared value. Our engagement programs, which 
are overseen by our executive leadership , ensure that 
we establish regular communications with our local 
stakeholders, assess community impacts, create 
development programs, and provide opportunities for 
stakeholders to share any concerns . Our community 
engagement also seeks to identify and connect with 
indigenous people who live near our operations.
Throughout MPC  and MPLX , we believe that being 
a good neighbor means promptly addressing and 
responding to community concerns. We maintain  
hotlines for neighbors of our facilities and landowner s 
of our pipeline rights of way . These local hotlines are 
critical components of our community engagement 
programs, allow ing neighbors and communities to 
call anytime with concerns or questions. We direct 
concerns  to the appropriate department to be 
address ed and, when needed, we escalate concerns to 
facility manager s and other leadership.

DATAStakeholder Engagement Plans
We believe it is important to coordinat e across the 
organization to prioritize our stakeholders’ interests 
and to oversee progress toward our shared goals. 
We also recognize that each community in which 
our refineries operate is unique. Accordingly, our 
stakeholder engagement plans are a collaborative effort 
between corporate  and facility  leadership to develop 
and document a differentiated plan for each facility or 
geographic area . These plans contain the objectives, 
strategies and tactics that can guide effective 
engagement with stakeholders, including:
• Community leaders and neighbors
• Select advocacy groups, nonprofit organizations 
and media
• State and local government and regulatory officials 
and their staffs
• Major customers and business partners
• Employees and retirees 
While there are some elements consistent across 
all plans, each facility  identifies strategies to engage  
key stakeholders and audiences  that are unique to 
their circumstances . 
A majority  of our refineries convene Community 
Advisory Panels (CAPs), which include representatives 
from various stakeholder groups and MPC employees. 
These CAPs meet on a regular basis and provide 
an opportunity for refinery leadership to update the community on key projects and share the facility’s 
safety and environmental performance. We also 
solicit feedback from the community at our CAP 
meetings, giving us to critical insight into our role in the 
community  and allowing us to modify our operations, 
if needed.

stakeholders’ concerns related to our Detroit refinery and 
to enhance transparency with media and local officials. The 
refinery hosted educational refinery tours for our stakeholders 
throughout the year to demonstrate the extensive investments  
we have made to prevent emissions from escaping our petroleum 
coke system . We produced a n informational video about the 
refinery’s state-of-the-art coker operation and published it  
on a community website dedicated to the  Detroit refinery ’s

DATAEarning Your Trust Program
Through its Earning Your Trust program , Marathon Pipe Line (MPL) engages the public and key stakeholders on the importance of pipeline infrastructure, encouraging 
landowners and communities to join us as guardians of public  safety. The Earning Your Trust program helps MPL focus on stakeholder engagement while encouraging 
employees to be positive ambassadors when interacting with the public. 
Landowners
MPL is always listening to its landowners. 
We garner feedback through surveys 
and focus groups and gather trust score 
data to help us focus our outreach 
efforts where they are needed most. In 
2019, MPL held  six events reaching 
1,450  landowners and mailed 
communications to more than 28,000  
households . Focused outreach events 
for farmers, who account for 50% of 
our landowners, were held throughout 
the year . Small events can have a big 
impact when the heart of the mission is to 
connect and educate others.
Communities
In 2019 , MPL held 20 emergency 
preparedness workshops and 
hosted 78 local community events, 
reaching 60 local public officials, 
259 emergency officials, and 123 places 
of congregation , including hospitals, 
long -term care facilities, daycares and 
schools . As a guardian of public safety, 
educating our communities on pipeline 
safety is essential .Schools
MPL provided Earning Your Trust 
outreach efforts at 29  schools and 
youth programs, reaching more than  
3,000 students . MPL has developed 
tailored programs for school-aged children. 
Petroleum Fuels My Life (grades 3-5) and 
Moving Energy (grades 6-12) help educate 
students about our industry through 
hands -on activities and demonstrations .Industry and Public Officials
As the petroleum pipeline industry 
works to shift from public awareness to 
public engagement, MPL openly shared 
best practices we have discovered and 
implemented as we continue our journey 
to earn  the public ’s trust . To continue 
educating and influencing change at the 
state level, MPL held five events that 
engaged more than 250 public officials

Building and maintaining relationships with i ndigenous 
groups near our existing facilities and proposed projects 
is a vital part of our business. We recognize i ndigenous 
groups as our partners  who have a distinct  relationship 
with the land , and we are committed to respecting their 
rights as we interact with them on operational matters.
The MPC Tribal Affairs Work Group  is our proactive 
appro ach to understand  areas of concern and to build 
sustaining relationships with tribes within our operational 
footprint and with federal, state and local agencies involved 
in tribal issues. By anticipating and addressing matters that 
are relevant to both MPC and tribal stakeholders, we create 
mutually beneficial opportunities. This past year we were 
able to partner with several organizations and strengthen 
relationships with indigenous stakeholders.
In response to COVID-19, we supported the Navajo Nation 
in New Mexico and Swinomish tribe in Washington during 
their response efforts. The Navajo Nation in particular 
faced significant impacts from the pandemic. We 
donated $20,000 for medical supplies to Navajo Medical 
Services, as well as 20,000 N95 respirator masks, 500 
digital thermometers, 150 gallons of hand sanitizer, 5,400 
surgical masks, and 5,000 cloth masks. Additionally, we 
sent 1,000 N95 respirator masks to the Swinomish tribe.
2019 Highlights
MPC was a key partner and investor for the Navajo 
Energy Summit, a three-day event for the Navajo Nation 
that provides a holistic approach to energy that includes 
environmental conservation and incorporates the following 
aspects of Navajo Nation life, culture and resources:
• Navajo minerals , oil, gas, renewables
• Agriculture, forestry, heritage and historical preservation
• Water resources, parks and r ecreation , resources 
enforcement
• Land developmentMPC was the major sponsor of the Gallup Inter-tribal 
Indian Ceremonial. The C eremonial is a week-long 
celebration of all things Native American; from an a rts 
exhibit, song and d ance competition, nightly dance 
performances, a p ow-wow, a q ueen contest and t iny-
tot pageant, and many r odeo events. 
MPC was a s ponsor of the Ute Nation Summer 
Pow-Wow. With significant operations on Ute tribal 
lands, we are proud to support important customs of 
the people living on this land. The summer p ow-wow is 
the tribe’s main event each year.MPC’s Tribal Affairs Group donated $8,000 to the 
Manuelito Navajo Children’s Home (MNCH). This money 
was used to help complete a transitional housing 
project for the home. The MNCH houses 20 children 
who are permanently placed in their facility, either by 
New Mexico Social Services, the Navajo Nation Social 
Services, the Zuni Tribal Social Services, or by families 
that are unable to care for the children. By building a 
transitional housing unit for the children, MNCH will 
provide the children with the option of transitioning to 
the workforce while remaining in a safe environment. MPC TRIBAL AFFAIRS

Since our founding in 18 87, MPC’s  roots have been 
firmly planted in the communities where our employees 
live and work. We believe our responsibility to these 
communities does not end with simply delivering 
the fuels and other products that enhance life’s 
possibilities . Whether through the Marathon Petroleum 
Foundation, our new “ MPC Gives ” program or other 
community activities, our philanthropic efforts touch the 
lives of thousands.Marathon Petroleum Foundation, Inc. 
The Marathon Petroleum Foundation’s mission is to 
strengthen communities and help make people’s lives 
better. Our 501(c)(3) charitable foundation actively 
seeks to make investments and partner with charitable 
organizations in three areas that reflect the priorities of 
our community stakeholders, align with our core values, 
bring our strategy to life, and where we believe MPC 
and the Marathon Petroleum Foundation can make a positive, measurable impact: science, technology, 
engineering and math (STEM) education ; public safety ; 
and environmental conservation/sustainability. 
The Marathon Petroleum Foundation had a busy and 
productive 2019 – a year during which we saw firsthand 
the positive impact we had and the smiles of those who 
benefited from the programs and services we provide

DATASTEM Education 
Increasing access to high-quality educational 
resources and instruction provides STEM 
opportunities for students and helps to develop 
the skills needed for rewarding careers . Many 
young people who live in high-poverty communities 
grow up without exposure to STEM education 
opportunities,  and even fewer receive much needed 
job skills training. In response, t he Marathon Petroleum 
Foundation collaborated with the Boys and Girls 
Clubs of Los Angeles Harbor, Long Beach 
and Carson, C alifornia,  to offer the MPC STEM 
ACADEMY , an afterschool program aimed at young 
people from low-income households . MPC STEM 
ACADEMY provides two to four hours of STEM-related 
learning opportunities to middle-school students 
two to three days a week at multiple sites. Through a 
combination of hands-on, project-based activities, 
academic support ( such as tutoring), field trips 
(including to science centers, businesses, colleges 
and universities) and presentations from experts and 
professionals (including MPC employees  and other 
volunteers), students increased their awareness, 
understanding of and interest in STEM-related 
concepts, post-secondary educational opportunities 
and careers.
Families, the Boys and Girls Club staff, and students 
themselves found that program participants honed 
more than just technical skills ; they developed social 
and emotional learning competencies related to self-
awareness, self-management and relationship skills, all 
vital building blocks necessary for developing a skilled 
and sustainable career .Public Safety
Promoting the health and safety of our people 
extends to our communities, where we focus on 
building stronger, safer places to live, work and play.
The Marathon Petroleum Foundation joined forces with 
several local community fire departments to provide 
their units with updated first-responder equipment to 
ensure the safety of the firefighters, as well as promote 
a better first response to community needs and help 
mitigate future emergencies. The Marathon Petroleum 
Foundation’s funding also supported the purchase of 
four new bloodmobiles and three new emergency-
response vehicles in California, Washington, Texas, 
Arizona and Utah. These vehicles will provide 
prevention and response services to individuals 
and communities recovering from natural disasters, 
including wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding.
Environment
Supporting local organizations devoted to 
efforts that protect, conserve and sustain our 
environmental resources is part of our corporate 
commitment to environmental stewardship .
The Marathon Petroleum Foundation  worked with the 
Salt Lake County Health Department  to develop 
the Vehicle Repair Assistance Program , which works 
to reduce mobile emissions by repairing qualifying 
vehicles that fail emissions testing . Because vehicles  
with properly functioning emissions control equipment 
emit fewer pollutants , funding from the Marathon 
Petroleum Foundation helps provide repairs free of 
charge for individuals who would have otherwise 
received a hardship waiver.

Our S upply C hain organization provides essential support to our business operations and extends  our commitment 
to sustainability beyond our doorstep. The S upply C hain organization is comprised of Refining, MPLX and non-

Supplier Demographics
We engage suppliers, consultants and contract workers 
to assist  in our operations. These suppliers provided 
goods and services such as materials, equipment, 
construction, labor, transportation, office products and 
services, benefits administration, and accounting, legal 
and engineering services. These reliable, highly capable 
and trusted partners share our core values and drive 
for superior results. Our suppliers achieve high safety 
and ethical standards, offer innovative, value-added 
capabilities, understand our business, embrace 
quality procedures and processes, and offer superior 
technology, cost or service advantages.We manage risk, in part, through the selection of 
our suppliers. Our robust procurement  process 
evaluates  our suppliers against key safety metrics and 
programs. Between the use of predominantly  U.S. 
domestic suppliers, which  are bound by U.S. laws 
and regulations, and focused vetting of international 
suppliers, MPC’s strategic procurement decisions 
inherently reduce supply chain risks to human rights, 
environmental and worker safety. No significant 
changes to our Supply Chain occurred in 2019 that 
would cause or contribute to significant economic, 
environmental or social impacts.

Workforce Safety
We continually evaluate our processes to further 
reduce the risk of incident and injury. Our employees, 
contractors and subcontractors are held to the same 
standards and expectations for health and safety and 
are empowered to stop any work where they feel at 
risk. Programs like Behavior Based Safety allow active 
engagement where employees can openly discuss 
alternatives that lead to safer decisions. MPC’s and 
MPLX’s tiered auditing process provides a rigorous 
assessment of all risks, with the development of corrective actions and management oversight until 
audit closure. These efforts have allowed us to 
continuously improve  and adjust our safety programs . 
In 2019, R etail operations had its best safety 
performance yet.
Our Refining organization has also documented its plan 
for continual improvement in safety management in its 
Refining Safety, Security and  Process Safety Strategic 
Direction document. This strategy lays out specific targets and actions over the next five years for achieving 
excellence in safety, process safety and environmental 
performance in the five categories below :

DATAContractor Safety
Our Refining organization has placed upon its 
contractors the same safety and health practices it has 
for its employees. The organization has set goals to 
continue to improve contractor safety over the next five 
years, including:
• Establish a Refining-wide contractor safety 
excellence task force
• Gain alignment with key Refining contractors on 
safety expectations
• Implement contractor management best practices 
across all refineries
• Establish contractor safety scorecards for all key 
contractors across all refineries
Prior to starting work at any of our facilities, all 
contractors and subcontractors conducting what MPC 
defines as “safety sensitive” work, must complete a 
series of requirements. A pre-job safety questionnaire 
must be filled out , and daily safe work permits are 
completed by the MPC employee with input from the 
contractor . This ensures our safety culture is one that 
empowers everyone to create and maintain a safe and 
healthy workplace.
Incident Reporting and 
Tracking System
In 2019, MPC and MPLX  completed their  first year 
utilizing the company -wide software system to actively 
report, track and identify trends in incidents and 
injuries. This software was designed with employee  
input to ensure all aspects of the tool could be used 
across the entire company and meet our high standard 
of incident/injury reporting.  All employees have the 
right to report an incident or injury without reprisal. 
Using a single system allows any employee to report an 
incident while eliminating confusion due to the various 
reporting historically used by each of the organizations. 
The company -wide system enables tracking and 
documentation of incident investigations and corrective 
actions, with management oversight to closure, if 
needed. In 2020, an auditing module will be rolled 
out as the final piece to bring the entire MPC audit, 
incident and Management of Change (MOC) tracking 
system together. 
Behavior Based Safety (BBS)
BBS was developed as a way to empower employees 
to enhance safety practices in the workplace through 
peer observations, or contacts.
• Helps identify the reasons for operational choices 
employees make
• Reinforce s safe behaviors
• Helps  identify safer ways to perform a task
• Helps  employees start the conversations that lead 
to safer decisions before an injury occursBBS manages employee exposure at the working 
interface:  the point at which employee activities interact 
with workplace conditions and management systems. 
Safety excellence is directly related to how effective our 
organization is at controlling exposure to hazards , and 
much of our success  has been a direct result of BBS 
initiatives. Through BBS and our other safety programs 
we continuously strive to prevent incidents.

Emergency Preparedness
We proactively prepare for emergencies to ensure we 
can respond effectively should the need ever arise. 
Each of our operating locations have emergency 
response teams and site-specific emergency 
preparedness and response plans tailored to the risks 
they may encounter. These location-specific plans are 
subject to regular drills and exercises to ensure proper 
implementation in the event of a real incident.
Corporate Emergency Response Team (CERT)
CERT is a highly trained group of approximately 
250 MPC professionals across the corporation with 
nationally recognized response expertise. CERT 
members are trained in National Incident Management 
System Incident Command Structure (NIMS ICS). 
Members participate in training and drills annually either 
within their business unit or in a formal CERT exercise.  
Training and drills are coordinated with governmental 
agencies and other interested stakeholders.
Tiered CERT Response
MPC  and MPLX  operate  a tiered response system that  
allows the response to be directed at the appropriate 
level within the organization and with flexibility to adjust 
the response team size commensurate with the needs 
of the response. 
• Tier 1 incidents are typically small in size and 
directed by a local response level team.
• Tier 2 incidents are medium in size and directed by 
a district/regional response level team.
• Tier 3 incidents are larger in size or complexity and 
directed by the Corporate Emergency Response 
Team (CERT).
Oil Pollution Act (OPA)-90 : Emergency Preparedness 
For all of our pipelines, vessels, and facilities subject to OPA-90, we have implemented response plans and have 
established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures plans. Our plans ensure:
• All barges used for river transport of raw materials and refined products are double-hulled to reduce the risk 
of spills .
• All new vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters are also double-hulled and existing vessels are either 
double-hulled or appropriately retrofitted .
• We maintain a drill and exercise program consistent with the National Preparedness for Response Exercise 
Program (PREP). PREP is a unified federal effort and satisfies the drill and exercise requirements of the 
U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) .
• Appropriate onshore facility containment countermeasures are in place .56

DATADrills and Exercises
Across MPC  and MPLX , our business units ensure their 
plans and procedures for continuing operations under, 
or subsequent to, adverse situations are up to date, 
and that employees know how to carry them out. Each 
year, MPC  and MPLX  execute a variety of drills within 
each business unit to review, critique and improve 
emergency response plans. For example, our MPLX 
Marine business  utilizes different types of drills and 
exercises to ensure its preparedness, including facility 
and vessel security, spills  and emergency response . We 
participate in the National Preparedness for Response 
Exercise Program to meet the intent of the Oil Pollution 
Act of 1990. We implement Facility Response Plans 
and contract with oil spill removal organizations to 
assist us in the event of a real incident.
MPC  and MPLX  maintain  a robust drill planning 
program that exceeds federal, state and local 
requirements. At the core of the program, drills are 
conducted with highly trained employees who come 
together during an incident and work seamlessly with 
federal, state and local partners.
 
Process Safety
Process safety means maintaining pipes, tanks, 
processing units, valves and other equipment so that they 
work as intended, keeping materials contained and our 
employees and communities safe. Our OEMS and strict 
adherence to P rocess Safety M anagement (PSM) enables  
us to proactively mitigate process safety risks. This 
includes equipment integrity, management of change , 
safe work practices and operating procedures. At MPC  
and MPLX , process safety is composed of 14 elements1.
MPC maintains specific standards for PSM, emphasizing 
the management of hazards by using technologies, 
procedures and management practices. We maintain 
a rigorous auditing schedule to ensure facilities are 
assessed across all 14 process safety elements. Findings 
are recorded and tracked to closure through our incident  
tracking tool . All major changes in process go through a 
series of steps to ensure risks have been mitigated.
Our midstream operations follow the American Petroleum 
Institute’s Recommended Practice 1173 for Pipeline 
Safety Management Systems. Our program provides a 
framework and systematic approach to: 
• Identify environmental, health and safety risks
• Prevent or mitigate the consequences of an incident 
and assure operations continuity
• Continuously improve pipeline safety and integrity
1  The state of California has further requirements than those 
listed above, with which we comply.Process Safety Event Metrics
We closely measure and monitor the trends of 
performance data with the objective of continuously 
improving process safety performance. Our process 
safety strategy is built on the belief that improving  Tier 1 
and Tier 2 performance is possible only if we rigorously 
adhere to our process safety management systems. Each 
program or process by itself has an impact that is hard 
to measure, but cumulatively they result in measurable 
performance improvement.

Health and Wellness
The health and well -being of our employees is of 
paramount importance, and we strive to support 
our employees on their journey to better health. 
Our Corporate Health Services team operates 
21 clinics across our locations with  over 75 medical 
professionals providing on-site access to health 
services.  We also provide a Nurseline that is available 
24 hours a day through our online platforms. We 
offer on-site amenities, such as fitness and wellness 
resources, and provide virtual and on-site educational 
sessions delivered by a team of dedicated health and 
wellness professionals. Our wellness champions, 
a combination of clinicians and health-passionate 
employee volunteers, add an additional grassroots 
support element.
Our programs place significant emphasis on preventive 
health. For example, our Well AllWays incentive 
program, which is open to all MPC employees, offers 
a cash stipend for completion of an online health 
assessment an d annual preventive physical. This 
program encourages employees to take charge of 
their health, develop relationships with their primary 
care physicians, and catch potential problems in 
early stages to allow for more successful treatment 
options. The stipend amounts increase with spouse 
participation. We actively promoted this wellness 
incentive program and saw a significant participation 
increase in 2019, with over 12,000 employees getting 
a preventive physical and approximately 9,000 
participants completing the online health assessment.
We recently developed our Let’s Talk mental health 
awareness strategy, which launched in 2019. This 
comprehensive initiative focuses on decreasing the 
stigma associated with mental health, generating 
awareness of common mental health illnesses and 
presenting available resources.We also offer a wide variety of wellness activities, 
such as health fairs and expos to showcase local 
organizations in the areas where we operate, 
corporate-wide challenges, and coordination of 
teams for company-sponsored health and wellness 
community activities, including the American Heart 
Association Heart Walk and Susan G. Komen Race 
for the Cure. Our annual My Fuel contest is another 
popular initiative through which employees submit 
photos of themselves participating in their favorite 
healthy activity.
Industrial Hygiene
The recognition, evaluation and control of workplace 
hazards across multiple locations and products in a 
responsible, compliant and consistent manner has 
been a long -standing goal  within MPC’s Industrial 
Hygiene program. Program responsibilities include 
Personal Exposure Evaluations, Indoor Air Quality 
Investigations and atmospheric monitoring.  MPC’s 
Exposure Assessment Methodology (EXAM) is a 
comprehensive strategy for assessing and managing 
occupational exposures based on risk. This includes 
qualitative and quantitative analyses against a control. 
Data is then tracked and trended to ensure regulatory 
compliance and showcase opportunities for 
improvement in a certain work practice. For example, 
ergonomic assessments throughout operations have 
resulted in the improvement of particular work tasks 
by eliminating potential pinch points, awkward body 
positions and repetitive movements.58

DATAProtecting and Supporting Our Workforce During the COVID-19 Pandemic
The impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic brought out the best in MPC employees. In March 2020, 
MPC activated its Corporate Emergency Response Team to ensure a consistent and aggressive response 
across all facets of our company. The safety and health of our employees, including our essential 
personnel, were our top priority. As part of our existing pandemic plan, we had a central inventory of 
N95 respirators, surgical masks, and nitrile gloves to supply to our employees and contractors when 
the pandemic began. We implemented a number of protective measures to ensure their safety as they 
continued to keep our critical operations running safely. Some of the actions taken by MPC specifically 
aimed at protecting and addressing the needs of our employees and contractors included:
• Providing critical up-to-date information and guidance through a dedicated COVID-19 
employee website
• Converting a hotline used for work-related injuries into a dedicated 24/7 nurse hotline
• Enhancing our cleaning and disinfection measures at all of our locations
• Providing appropriate personal protective equipment
• Implementing social distancing procedures for our essential employees (federally designated 
Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers) and work-from-home requirements for other employees, 
where practicable
At our Speedway facilities, our COVID-19 response included:
• Closed all 24-hour stores for one  hour per day to allow for enhanced cleaning
• Limited the number of customers inside the store
• Taped markings on the floors to guide social distancing
• Installed over 6,000 plexiglass barriers at point-of-sale stations to provide an additional layer of 
protection to our employees and customers
• Established up to two weeks of emergency pay for all employees related to COVID-19 mandated 
quarantine, diagnosis or chronic health condition
• Increased pay for hourly employees by $2 per hour and provided bonus payout adjustments for g eneral 
managers  through June 10 , 2020
• No repercussions for those employees who do not want to work due to being uncomfortable working 
for any reason
We have responded quickly to evolving circumstances, and we will continue to monitor the situation and 
act in the best interest of our stakeholders.59

Risk Management 
Our strong E nterprise Risk Management (ERM) program 
is the means by which we identify, assess and manage 
enterprise level risks, and review the effectiveness and 
performance of risk mitigation strategies. 
Roles and Responsibilities
Risk oversight is one of our Board’s most critical 
functions. While the Board has ultimate responsibility for 
overseeing risk management, it delegates certain risk 
oversight responsibilities to its four standing committees, 
which regularly report back to the full Board. 
Our senior management has primary responsibility for 
managing risks and implementing risk management 
strategies. The ERM process is sponsored by our 
president and chief executive officer and our e xecutive 
vice president and chief financial officer, led by our 
enterprise risk manager, and supported by officers and 
senior managers responsible for working across the 
business to manage enterprise level risks and identify 
emerging risks. 
Our ERM Process 
Our ERM process is continuous and dynamic. It involves 
a cross-functional review of potential enterprise level risks, 
including sustainability risks. The process for identifying 
and assessing enterprise level risks, such as those that 
may impact our ability to operate, is led by our enterprise 
risk manager through quarterly leadership workshops. 
These workshops involve key leaders with responsibility 
for our  sustainability priorities. Our risk analysis includes 
an examination of the causes and consequences of 
each enterprise level risk, as well as the development 
of prevention and mitigation strategies. Our process allows us to identify emerging risks and to efficiently 
allocate resources. Enterprise level risks and strategies 
are routinely reviewed and discussed by the Board and 
executive leadership. Our Board further reviews our 
process and performance trends and oversees internal 
controls and audits to evaluate effectiveness.
Material  Risks
Material risks to our company are disclosed in the Risk 
Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K 
and other filings with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. These include risks related to the legal 
and regulatory environment. 
Climate-Related Risk
We carefully evaluate and manage climate-related 
risks and opportunities to ensure our strength, 
adaptiveness and resiliency. For information on how we manage climate-related risks and opportunities, as 
well as the role of internal cross-functional committees 
developing integrated strategies to effectively predict 
and manage different aspects of climate-related risks 
and opportunities, see our 2019 Perspectives on 
Climate-Related Scenarios Report , Pages  8-9.
Compliance-Related Risk 
As part of our ERM p rocess, our Board oversees 
risks related to the evolving regulatory landscape, 
including emerging and proposed regulations for topics 
such as greenhouse gas and other air emissions, 
water withdrawals and effluents, hazardous materials 
management, product specifications and employee 
health and safety.

Operational Excellence Management System
Our Health, Environment, Safety, Security and 
Sustainability performance is a responsibility shared by 
everyone, including all of our employees, contractors 
and business partners. Our commitment to conduct our 
business in a safe, clean , secure, responsible and cost-
effective manner is set forth in our policies, standards 
and procedures, and managed through our OEMS .
Following 15 years of performance improvement 
under our Responsible Care® Management S ystem 
(RCMS), in 2018 we combined our RCMS into a more 
comprehensive RC14001® management system. 
RC14001® is third-party audited to ensure conformance 
and continual improvement. In 2019, in connection 
with the combination of MPC and Andeavor, we began 
development of our integrated OEMS, which is built on 
a strong foundation of best practices from both legacy 
companies. Our new OEMS expands on the RC14001® 
scope and will also align with ISO9001, focusing on 
product quality. This combination helps to ensure best practices for continual improvement of our operations 
and the availability, utilization, profitability and reliability 
of our assets. It also supports our ability to manage 
risk, engage with our stakeholders and further commit 
to our sustainability objectives. 
Our OEMS provides a systematic  approach to 
advancing performance by outlining requirements that 
will enable MPC to achieve our goals and ensure our long-term success. To drive further consistency, we 
complement our management system with required 
performance-based standards that set organizational 
expectations. These standards are periodically 
reviewed and updated to reflect changes in laws or 
regulations, incorporate recommendations arising from 
audits and incident investigations, and to continually 
improve performance.

Compliance and Ethics
Our Board of Directors, e xecutive leadership team 
and our thousands of employees know that exercising 
sound judgment and preserving our reputation for 
integrity are critical to our success. The cultivation and 
safeguarding of this commitment to responsible and 
ethical conduct throughout the organization is led by 
our chief compliance officer.
Our Business Integrity Committee, chaired by the c hief 
compliance officer and comprised of cross-functional 
members of executive leadership and senior 
management, promotes  the effectiveness of our 
enterprise-wide Compliance and Ethics Program.
MPC’s Code of Business Conduct requires  that 
employees immediately report any suspected illegal or 
unethical conduct connected with the business of MPC 
or its affiliates.
Legal Compliance
We are subject to laws and regulations covering 
all aspects of our operations. With respect to our 
employees, we comply with legal requirements 
governing safety, workers’ rights and minimum wage, 
and equal employment opportunity. Our approach to 
environmental stewardship goes beyond compliance 
with evolving laws and regulations to include 
implementation of proactive initiatives to safeguard 
the environment and the communities where we live 
and work. We not only expect our employees to be 
knowledgeable about applicable legal requirements 
and act accordingly, we select contractors, suppliers 
and other business partners that demonstrate a similar 
commitment to legal and regulatory compliance.
Code of Business Conduct
We must obey the law, but we strive for an 
even higher standard.
Operating with the highest standards of integrity is part 
of our culture at MPC and MPLX . Our Code of Business 
Conduct is framed by law , but most importantly it is 
based on the principle that we do the right thing. The 
Code defines expectations for ethical decision-making, 
accountability and responsibility for every employee 
at all levels of MPC , including those providing services 
to MPLX . 
Code Training and Certification
We require Code of Business Conduct training and a 
new hire questionnaire for all MPC employees at hire. 
MPC salaried employees are required to complete an 
annual Code of Business Conduct certification . This 
includes a questionnaire and provides the opportunity 
for employees to disclose issues that could present a 
violation of the Code.Our business partners, including suppliers, consultants and 
contract workers, are expected to comply with the Code, 
as well as the law, and to support effective compliance 
programs in their own organizations. In 2020, we also 
announced a Supplier Code of Conduct. More information 
on our Supplier Code of Conduct can be found in the Our 
Suppliers section of this report on P age 50 .

855-857-5700
www.FuelingIntegrity.com
Our Integrity Helpline serves as a resource for our 
employees, contractors, vendors and customers  to 
ask questions or raise allegations related to workplace 
behavior or ethics. While we always encourage 
speaking with an immediate supervisor or other 
designated personnel, the Integrity Helpline provides 
the opportunity to speak on an anonymous basis. 
Every allegation received through the Integrity 
Helpline is investigated in a manner and to the 
extent appropriate based on the nature of the 
allegation, with the goal to resolve the matter within 
90 days.  Investigations may result in discipline where 
warranted, a change in policy or procedure, or a 
determination that an allegation of unlawful and/or 
unethical behavior could not be substantiated . We 
maintain a firm no-retaliation policy and will never 
permit a good-faith submission  to be a cause for 
disciplinary action. 
Integrity Helpline statistics are reported to the Audit 
Committee of our Board of Directors, with certain 
allegations escalated quickly. These include certain 
allegations regarding financial statements and 
reporting and allegations of Code violations by our 
directors or officers.Human Rights Policy
MPC’s and MPLX’s Human Rights Policy represents 
our commitment to respect the human, cultural 
and legal rights of all individuals and communities.  
We promote the goals and principles of the 
United  Nations Declaration of Human Rights and 
meet the expectations of the Voluntary Principles 
on Security and Human Rights.  We strive to engage 
and inform our stakeholder s and the communities 
where we operate.  We promote the well -being of our 
employees by providing competitive compensation 
and benefits, maintaining safe and healthy work 
environments, respecting their freedom to associate 
and collectively bargain, and promoting diversity and 
inclusion.  We prohibit harassment and discrimination 
and the use of coerced, forced and child  labor.
Integrity of our Financial Records 
Our President and CEO , CFO, controller , treasurer 
and other leaders performing similar roles are 
subject to our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial 
Officers. This separate Code of Ethics affirms the 
principles of honesty, integrity and sound judgment 
expected of our senior executives with responsibility 
for preparation and certification of our financial 
statements. In responding to and reporting any 
alleged Code of Ethics violation, MPC’s Business 
Integrity and Compliance organization has direct 
access to the Chairman, CEO, CFO, Vice President 
Audit , and the chair of the Audit Committee.
Our Whistleblowing as to Accounting Matters Policy 
specifically addresses complaints received by the 
company regarding accounting, internal accounting 
controls or auditing matters.  This policy establishes 
procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment 
of allegations of unethical behavior and provides for

Cybersecurity
MPC implements robust policies and standards 
to protect our computer systems, data, assets, 
infrastructure and computing environments from 
cybersecurity threats, and to ensure continued 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 
Responsibility and Oversight
MPC’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has 
responsibility for MPC’s Cybersecurity program. In 
addition to compliance with legal requirements, our 
Computer Security Policy requires the development and 
maintenance of a comprehensive governance process, 
including standards, procedures, risk management, 
defense strategy and compliance reviews. Our Code of 
Business Conduct  further addresses protective uses 
of company assets, information systems, social media, 
business records retention and confidential information. 
The CISO provides periodic briefings to the Audit 
Committee and the board. The security and integrity 
of our computer systems is the responsibility of 
everyone at MPC. Our cybersecurity policies apply 
to all MPC entities, staff and third parties that own, 
manage, administer, support, develop or work on 
MPC information systems, and to all our computing 
environments, whether connected to or segregated 
from our corporate network. Our Code of Business 
Conduct  likewise extends beyond MPC to our business 
partners. Policy compliance for employees is reinforced 
through training  and supervisor engagement , and 
enforced through a structured discipline escalation 
program, if needed.  Multi faceted Strategy
We manage technology risks through a resilient system 
of layered security architecture. Security limits are 
placed on physical access, business and operational 
networks are segmented, and critical applications 
are aligned to hardened data centers. Our internal 
information technology controls allow for centralized 
security event correlation and detection. Our 
cybersecurity program is in alignment with the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology – Cybersecurity 
Framework, a control framework that helps companies 
develop a standardized model on which to build their 
cybersecurity program and to subsequently measure 
their “cyber maturity.”
To address third -party risks, MPC maintains a 
proactive data-centric cybersecurity risk assessment 
and management program focused on both internal 
and third-party vendor provided capabilities. This due 
diligence program continues to expand in response to a 
changing cloud landscape. 
This cybersecurity system is supported by a culture of 
diligence. Threat awareness and prevention training 
begins upon hire and continues throughout an 
employee’s tenure, with materials delivered through 
email, digital signage and presentations. Employees 
utilize mechanisms to report and escalate suspicious 
incidents through simple tools that enable them to 
easily report phishing or other cyber threats to our IT 
Service Desk. Our simulated phishing program provides 
immediate feedback to users, with notification sent to 
the individual’s management for repeat failures. As a 
result of this effort, we maintain phishing susceptibility 
well below general industry rates. 
Incident response procedures and business continuity 
plans are in place and tested annually. To ensure 
preparedness, we conduct risk assessments, 
vulnerability analyses and targeted penetration testing 
throughout the year. We also use independent third 
parties to audit, assess and test aspects of our 
cybersecurity program.68

DATAPrivacy
MPC and our consolidated subsidiaries work to protect 
the personal data we receive. We are compliant with 
all applicable privacy laws, including the California 
Consumer Privacy Act, as well as all applicable privacy 
regulations, and safeguards, which have been applied 
to our operations across the country. Where required, 
MPC and Speedway adhere to the Payment Card 
Industry Data Security Standard, which provides a 
baseline of technical and operational requirements 
to protect customers’ payment card account data, 
and we annually engage a third-party Qualified 
Security Assessor to complete an assessment of 
MPC and Speedway’s  compliance. 
Political Contributions and  Advocacy
MPC participates in the political process in a number 
of ways, including lobbying, grassroots activity, issue 
advocacy, participation in trade associations, supporting 
Marathon Petroleum Corporation Employees Political 
Action Committee (MPAC)1, and, where lawful, direct 
support of political candidates and engagement on 
ballot issues that impact MPC and our industry.
Our advocacy and contribution process is overseen by 
the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee  
of our Board of Directors and senior management. 
All uses of company funds or resources to participate 
in the political process are made with the intent to 
promote the best interests of the company.
Trade Associations
MPC is active in trade associations and similar groups 
at the national, state and local levels. We believe 
participation in these associations is important to the company’s role as an industry leader and as an 
active member of the business communities in which 
we operate. These associations engage in many 
activities for the benefit of their members, including 
encouraging industry standards among member 
companies and advocating on issues that impact 
their respective members. Through our participation 
in trade associations, we seek to champion legislative 
solutions that are in the best interests of the company. 
We recognize that viewpoints of other trade association 
members may differ from our own. When this occurs, 
we seek to work with the association membership to 
promote reasonable compromise. However, we do not 
control the position that any trade association may take 
on any particular issue.

DATALRQA Independent Assurance Statement
Relating to Marathon Petroleum Company LP’s Report for the Calendar Year 2019
This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Marathon Petroleum Company LP , in accordance with our contract. 
Terms of Engagement
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance, Inc. (LRQA) was commissioned by Marathon Petroleum Company LP (Marathon) to provide independent assurance of its 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory and GHG emissions intensity metrics (“the Report”) for the calendar year (CY) 2014 (base year) and CY 2019 against the 
assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using LRQA’s verification procedure and ISO 
14064 - Part 3 for greenhouse gas emissions. LRQA’s verification procedure is based on current best practise and is in accordance with ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410.
Our assurance engagement covered Marathon’s operations and activities and specifically the following requirements:
• Verifying conformance with:
• World Resources Institute / World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A corporate accounting and reporting 
standard, revised edition (otherwise referred to as the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol) for the GHG data1; and
• Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information for only the selected indicators listed below: 
• Direct (Scope 1), Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG Emissions, using the operational control consolidation methodology;
• Total Scope 1 & 2 GHG Intensity; 
• Refining scope 1 & 2 GHG intensity; and
• Natural gas processing scope 1 & 2 GHG intensity. 
LRQA’s responsibility is only to Marathon. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. Marathon’s responsibility 
is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the 
systems from which the Report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of Marathon.

DATALRQA’s Opinion
Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that Marathon has not, in all material respects:
• Met the requirements of the criteria listed above; and
• Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and information as summarized in Table 1 below.
The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance2 and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier.
Table 1. Summary of Marathon, GHG Emissions Inventory and Intensity Metrics for CY 2014 & CY 2019:
ParameterQuantity
Units CY 2014 CY 2019
Scope 1 GHG emissions 35.01 36.77 Million tonnes CO2e
Scope 2 GHG emissions (Location-based)17.14 8.18 Million tonnes CO2e
Scope 2 GHG emissions (Market-based)17.14 8.18 Million tonnes CO2e
Total Scope 1 & 2 GHG Intensity229.9 23.8 Tonnes CO2e / mboe input
Refining scope 1 & 2 GHG intensity333.7 29.5 Tonnes CO2e / mboe input
Natural gas processing scope 1 & 2 GHG intensity415.6 12.7 Tonnes CO2e / mboe input
1. Scope 2, Location-based and Scope 2, Market-based are defined in the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, 2015.
2. Excludes Retail and GHGs associated with exported power from cogeneration units.
3. Includes Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from refineries only. Also, excludes GHGs associated with exported power from cogeneration units.
4. Includes Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from natural gas processing (midstream) operations only.
LRQA’s Approach
LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure.  The following tasks were undertaken as part of the 
evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement: 
• interviewing relevant employees of the organization responsible for managing GHG emissions and environmental data and records; 
2.  The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically 
checking source data at sites. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed.71

DATA• assessing Marathon’s data management systems to confirm they are designed to prevent significant errors, omissions or mis-statements in the Report. 
We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling procedures, instructions and systems, including those for internal quality control; and
• verifying historical GHG emissions data and records at an aggregated level for the calendar years 2014 and 2019.
LRQA’s Standards and Competence
LRQA implements and maintains a comprehensive management system that meets accreditation requirements for ISO 14065 Greenhouse gases – 
Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition and ISO/IEC 17021 Conformity 
assessment – Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems that are at least as demanding as the requirements of the 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 and comply with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants.
LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome of all verification and 
certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent.

D&I Diversity and inclusion
DEI Designated Environmental Incident. A metric adopted by MPC to capture several categories simultaneously. It includes releases to the environment 
(including to air, land or water), permit exceedances and agency enforcement actions. MPC ranks DEIs in terms of their severity, with Tier 4 being the 
most severe, and Tier 1 being the least. Below are partial descriptions of the DEI Tiers:  
Tier 4 DEI:  
 - Release of oil or other hazardous material onto the land greater than or equal to 1,000 bbl.  
 - Release of oil or other hazardous material to a regulated water body greater than or equal to 100 bbl.  
 - Reportable release to air of a hazardous material greater than or equal to 100 times the reportable quantity  
Tier 3 DEI:  
 - Release of oil or other hazardous material onto the land greater than or equal to 100 bbl. but less than 1,000 bbl.  
 - Release of oil or other hazardous material to a regulated water body greater than or equal to 10 bbl. but less than 100 bbl.  
 -  Reportable release to air of a hazardous material greater than or equal to an established reportable quantity but less than 100 times the 
reportable quantity
Tier 2 DEI:  
 - Release of oil or other hazardous material onto the land greater than or equal to 10 bbl. but less than 100 bbl.  
 - Safety system failure or bypass  
 - Release of oil or other hazardous material into a regulated water body greater than or equal to 1 bbl. but less than 10 bbl.  
 - Release to air of a hazardous material greater than or equal to 80% of a reportable quantity but less than an established reportable quantity  
Tier 1 DEI:  
 - Release of oil or other hazardous material onto land that is less than 10 bbl. (if less than 1 bbl., release must also be a reportable release )

(1) As reported in the MPC 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(2) Based on the American Petroleum Institute’s definition of environmental expenditures.
(3)  These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation.
(4) Data before 2019 inclusive of facilities that MPC did not yet own so that performance can be compared across the same asset base over time. Assets included are those which MPC owned/
operated as of Dec. 31, 2019, unless otherwise noted. Estimates used in some instances where historic data was unavailable.
(5)  This footnote only pertains to data found within the Interactive Performance Data found online.
(6) Environmental performance reported for facilities of which MPC has operational control.
(7) Scope 1 direct GHG emissions include those from Refining, Midstream & Retail/other and are typically calculated per the EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program or the 2009 API 
Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry. Global Warming Potentials used are from Table A-1 to Subpart A of 40 CFR Part 98 as of the 
year they were reported. It includes emissions from fuel combustion, company vehicles and fugitive emissions.
(8) Inclusive of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), and perfluorocarbons (PFC) emissions are considered to not be 
material to our operations and are therefore excluded.
(9) The Martinez and Los Angeles refineries are currently subject to the California Cap-and-Trade Program.84

Retail. Tier 3 and 4 DEIs are the most significant types of DEIs.
 DEI performance is only inclusive of assets/entities that MPC owned in the reporting year, except Andeavor assets included in 2018 for Tier 3 & 4 data only.
(16) The USGS Protected Areas Database v.2.0 is the nation’s official inventory of public open space and private protected areas and was used to determine areas of protected conservation status. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Critical Habitat Data was used to determine areas of endangered species habitat. As MPC’s  operations are limited to the U.S., these two datasets are appropriate for 
the evaluation of this metric in place of the references suggested in the standard. 
 Approximations were used to determine the bounds of MPLX properties.

DATADisclosures regarding forward-looking statements
This publication includes forward-looking statements. You can identify our forward-looking statements by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “design,” “estimate,” 
“expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “imply,” “intend,” “objective,” “opportunity,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “pursue,” “prospective,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” 
“seek,” “strategy,” “target,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “would,” “will,” or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. We have based 
our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry and our company. We caution that these statements are not 
guarantees of future performance and you should not rely unduly on them, as they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we 
have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. While our management considers these 
assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, 
most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we 
have expressed or forecast in our forward-looking statements. In accordance with “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we 
have included in our Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2019, and Forms 10-Q, cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such 
factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Copies of MPC’s Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q are 
available on the SEC’s website, MPC’s website at https://www.marathonpetroleum.com/Investors/  or by contacting MPC’s Investor Relations office.
