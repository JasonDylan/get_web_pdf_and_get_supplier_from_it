We at SK Telecom will keep our ears

by SK Telecom over the past 20 years. I am pleased to present to you SK Telecom’s Sustainability Report, whichreflects our commitment to ensuring our sustainable growth by fulfilling our social responsibilities as atrustworthy enterprise.
SK Telecom started out as a small business outfit with just some 30 employees in 1984. We have since grown
into our present status as the first telecom company in Korea to surpass the $10 billion mark in revenues andwe have secured a subscriber base exceeding 20 million. These would not have been possible without thededication of our employees and the encouragement and support of our business partners and numerousstakeholders. Alongside our quantitative growth, we have spearheaded many changes in the Korean IT industrythrough new services such as wireless Internet, telematics, and satellite DMB. These developments have alsospurred advances in our economy, society, and culture. 
Our wide-ranging service offerings are more than just communication tools. I believe they are bringing people
closer together and will contribute to promoting the happiness of all members of our society. 
More than anything, this report, SK Telecom’s first Sustainability Report, is a testament to our efforts and
commitment to growing and evolving with our community. It is divided into six sections: Increasing our customervalue, enhancing our employee competency, raising our economic value, mutual cooperation with our businesspartners, social issues, and the environment. 
In the course of preparing this report, SK Telecom was able to reflect upon its past activities and performance.
We were also able to identify our shortcomings compared with global standards. We will bear these in mind aswe continuously improve on our activities in line with corporate sustainability management. 
We at SK Telecom will keep our ears and minds open to the diverse voices of our stakeholders, and will continue
to do our part as a responsible corporate citizen.

06PRESIDENT & CEO MESSAGEղ૑1.ಕ੉૑SK Telecom has been pioneering developments in the world’s information and telecommunications industry. We
were the first in the world to commercialize CDMA technology, the first to launch a satellite dedicated to digitalmobile broadcasting (DMB), and the first to roll out HSDPA service. We provide high-quality services, asevidenced by our No. 1 spot in the Mobile Communications category of Korea’s National Customer SatisfactionIndex (NCSI) for 9 consecutive years now. Our cutting-edge technologies and customer-oriented services arewhy around twenty million subscribers, more than 40% of Koreans, are our customers. These are also theengines behind our growth into a global telecom company with revenues surpassing $10 billion in 2005. 
We are harnessing our technological strength to seek opportunities for cooperation with telecom service
providers abroad. Our aim is to become a world leader in the convergence environment. 
Exceptional economic performance is vital to becoming a true world leader. However, businesses now have to go
beyond this and respond to what society expects of a pioneering and progressive company. The pursuit of profitalone will no longer guarantee survival. Rather, a company that contributes to driving healthy changes in society,i.e., one that fulfills its obligations as a corporate citizen, will prevail in the long run. Bearing this in mind, we atSK Telecom have made every effort to make our social responsibilities the crux of our strategy and vision, haveincorporated them in our systems and processes, and have embedded them in our corporate culture.
This report gave us an opportunity to look back on our activities so that we may return to society the trust and
support we received from it over the years. It also reflects our commitment to be a company that customers cantrust, a company where employees can work in a fulfilling work environment, a company that grows with itspartner firms, and a company that creates a happy world with our communities. Creating a world in whicheveryone can lead satisfying and fulfilling lives is what drives SK Telecom to provide quality communicationservices. 
SK Telecom is doing all it could to best perform its roles and functions as a responsible corporate citizen. I
firmly believe that this commitment will enable us to achieve sustainable growth and will lead to positivechanges for our stakeholders and society alike. 
We are pleased to issue this Sustainability Report, through which we can communicate our efforts to coexist
with our communities. On behalf of everyone at SK Telecom, I reaffirm our pledge to meet our responsibilitiesas a sound corporate citizen, and I ask for your continued encouragement and support.

(  CSM Vision & Strategy ) 
Vision
Balanced consideration of economic, environmental, and
social factors is essential for a company to gain the trust ofsociety and to achieve sustainable growth. SK Telecom isproactively responding to these challenges while solidifyingits market leadership and developing new growth enginesfor the future. We are also actively developing overseas markets in order to achieve critical mass in subscriber base 
both at home and abroad. Furthermore, we will continue togenerate growth momentum in the new convergent andubiquitous markets. We will pursue corporate sustainabilitymanagement(CSM) with support from inside and outside thecompany, creating new value for all stakeholders-customers, employees, shareholders, business partners andthe community.
Stakeholder-focused management differs from conventional
shareholder-oriented management practices in that it leadsto value creation on a long-term basis rather thanemphasizing short-term operating results, by giving dueconsideration to all of the diverse stakeholders.Furthermore, it signifies a paradigm shift in the role of a
business entity. That is, the responsibilities of a corporationencompass the social, ethical, and environmental aspects, inaddition to its economic performance. Total Value Maximization

Six Sigma
SK Telecom has adopted Six Sigma for its enhanced
implementation of SKMS and its continued processimprovement from its external clients’ point of view, ratherthan from its internal perspective. The ultimate goal is toinnovate the way in which all employees go about performingtheir duties. A total of 246 Six Sigma projects wereimplemented within 22-month period that ended in the firsthalf of 2006. In 2006, the direction of Six Sigma activitieswere as follows: expanded Mega Y (top-down approach) andGB(bottom-up method) projects to address company-wideissues and promote Six Sigma throughout the organization,increased the number of Six Sigma certifications such asMBB and BB, raised employees’ understanding andutilization of Six Sigma, and extended the scope of projects tocover business partners. These activities will allow forcontinued reinforcement of SUPEX to deliver not onlysatisfaction but also happiness to our customers. (   SK Telecom’s Role  as a Corporate Citizen  ) 
SK Telecom’s Social Responsibility
In 2006, the number of mobile phone subscribers in Korea is
expected to exceed 40 million, implying a penetration rate ofaround 85%. In view of our market share, approximately42.5% of Korea’s total population are customers of SKTelecom. In other words, almost half of the Korean people,excluding children and the elderly who find it difficult to usecellular phones, are patrons of our services. These numberssuggest that mobile telecom service has a significant impact,both direct and indirect, on our society. As the domesticleader in mobile telecommunications, SK Telecom will makeevery effort to achieve sound performance in the economic,social and environmental aspects. On the economic side, ourtarget is to generate KRW 10.5 trillion in revenues in 2006,thereby enhancing stakeholder value. In terms of socialresponsibility, we will continue to address social problems atthe root by creating jobs, narrowing the information divide,and carrying out volunteer works. To preserve theenvironment, the very foundation of our daily life, we willstrive to conserve and recycle resources, utilize eco-friendlytechnologies and reduce energy consumption.

(  Management Approach ) 
Policy
Driven by our customer-centered philosophy, we aspire to
create the greatest value for our customers, employees,and shareholders. This commitment forms the basis of ourcustomer satisfaction (CS) activities that are designed toraise customer value. Customer value (CV) refers to all thebenefits that customers receive by taking advantage of ourproducts and services. 
We reached an important milestone in 2005 as annual
revenue surpassed KRW 10 trillion. Our sights are now onmoving beyond the domestic market and evolving into aglobal leader. Recognizing that customers are integral toachieving that goal, we selected 
‘customer value
innovation ’as one of our priority tasks for 2006 and
classified our work of raising our customer value into valuecreation, value delivery and value realization. 
Management
In order to increase customer satisfaction levels, one of our
four management priorities in 2006 is innovating customervalue. To that end, we established the CV division and set upa CV team under the regional marketing division. 
We adopted the Six Sigma methodology to systematically
innovate customer value. We look at our business from thecustomers’ perspective and are improving our overallprocess to provide better services. We manage servicequality using diverse evaluation tools that allow us to raiseservice levels at customer contact points. Customersatisfaction is measured with our self-developed CustomerSatisfaction Index (CSI) model, while service quality isassessed using the Service Quality Index (SQI). The servicequality certification is another mechanism that helps usprovide standardized services at each of customer contactchannel.

Mobile telephony has become an everyday necessity. To
meet the corresponding rise in customer expectations,SK Telecom carries out various activities. For instance,we seek and implement measures to protect minorsfrom exposure to adult or violent contents. To preventexcessive data billings, we launched the fixed fee planfor data services. We are also making an effort to curbrandom spam mail. These activities are pivotal tomaintaining customer trust. 
SK Telecom has held on to first place in the three major
customer satisfaction surveys - the Korea NationalCustomer Satisfaction Index (NCSI), the Korean StandardService Quality Index (KS-SQI), and the Korean CustomerSatisfaction Index (KCSI). We are setting our sightshigher, though. We continue to seek ways to raisecustomer satisfaction by identifying and improving onweaknesses in any of the component areas in the CSIsurveys.

Customer Satisfaction Survey 
SK Telecom has retained its number one position in the
three major customer surveys in Korea - NCSI, KS-SQI andKCSI. According to the 2005 survey results, our customersatisfaction levels were relatively lower in the areas ofwireless Internet and value-added services, and higher in customer response and call quality. In addition to the CSI
surveys by outside agencies, SK Telecom conducts aninternal survey each year to improve on its weaknesses.Details of the external and internal CSI surveys are outlinedin the following table. 
Voice of Customer (VOC) Feedback Process 
SK Telecom carries out a wide range of activities to listen to
customer views and to reflect their opinions in our businessactivities. Considering the rise in customer inquiries, weestablished two more customer centers. We alsostrengthened monitoring to enhance the quality ofcustomer consultations with us. The diagram below shows the VOC feedback process. In
2005, the rate of making a reply within the designatedtimeframe (D+2 days) was 99.79% on average and it took usan average of 0.2 days to reply. We have 149 coordinatorsand a total of 1,187 personnel who respond to the varioustypes of VOC feedback. SurveyExternal

21Customer Satisfaction Activities 
Rainbow is a series of customer-centered innovation
programs launched in 2003. It forms the foundation ofcustomer value (CV) enhancement activities we pursued in2005. The programs are as follows: 
Rainbow Patrol
This is a 24-hour service that handles complaints on callquality. Some 800 personnel are available to visitcustomers and resolve complaints within 24 hours afterthey are filed. 
Rainbow A/S
This service was launched to swiftly respond to requests forhandset repairs. Customer can make requests for aftersales service (A/S) at SK Telecom dealers and branches. Allrepairs are completed within 24 hours. 
Rainbow Academy
The Rainbow Academy offers courses to SK Telecomemployees serving at customer contact points so that theycan enhance their CS skills and provide standardizedservices. All employees at customer contact points receivethe training, whether or not they have direct customercontact. About 20,000 of employees had taken RainbowAcademy courses as of end December 2005. 
Rainbow Point

Customer Protection
22(  Customer Protection  ) 
Protection of Minors 
Public interest in the mobile communications industry is
growing with respect to the issue of protecting minors. Thisissue has two facets - protecting the young from harmfulcontents and guarding them from burdensome fees. 
Youth Protection from Harmful Contents
SK Telecom implements the following measures to protectminors from exposure to adult contents.
SK Telecom has been at the forefront of efforts to protect
the younger generation. We have selected protection ofminors as one of four actions plans to ensure customersafety. In view of adult contents’ adverse impact on thewireless Internet business, we decided to discontinueproviding such contents from July 2006, which meansgiving up a business generating annual revenue exceedingKRW 70 billion. This decision was prompted by our desire togrow the wireless Internet business and fulfill our socialand ethical responsibilities. 
Youth Protection from Excessive Fees
A program to benefit wireless Internet users is beingimplemented so that they may enjoy wireless Internetwithout worrying about data usage fees. When a customerwho does not subscribe to the fixed rate plan inadvertentlyincurs a hefty data usage fee while using wireless Internet,the amount in excess of KRW 200,000 will be exempted. Also,if the sum of data service and information usage exceeds acertain level, the customer is notified via SMS at variousstages (notice is also given to parents in the case of minors). Blocking Random Spam Mail 
Due to the growing number of complaints with regard to
spam messages sent via *SMS, SK Telecom is doing its partto reduce SMS spam. Tough sanctions are imposed oncontent providers (CPs) that send out illegal spam, and biz-SMS resellers now can transmit only 50 SMS messages persecond (versus the previous 500). We have set up a group ineach of our customer centers that exclusively handles SMSspam, and we have launched an internal campaign toencourage our employees to report spam. We will tightenour control over spam by applying a ‘strikeout’ system toCPs that send spam, introduce a filtering process forcustomers who do not wish to receive SMS messages fromour Nate business partners, and promote spam responsemeasures among our customers. 
Voluntary Standards for Mobile Contents 
SK Telecom has formulated the following voluntary ethical
standards for the mobile contents we provide to ourcustomers. ▶Blocking access to adult contents on mobile phones
registered under minors 
▶Blocking access to adult contents on mobile phonesused by minors but registered under their parent’sname (request to block adult contents is a check-point included in cellular service application form) 
▶Education and posters at distribution channels,notice on website, promotion via SMS, notice on bills 
Ethical Standards on Mobile Contents 
�Ban sexually explicit, violent, and other
expressions that are harmful to all age groupsin audio and video. 
�Preclude expressions that are mentally/
physically harmful to all age groups such asthose involving beliefs, religions or customsthat are not generally accepted. 
�Excessive bodily exposure, expression or
suggestion of a sexual act, or distortion ofsexual ethics 
�
Prohibit contents that induce sexual desire or shame 
�Prohibit obscenity, vulgar titles, and direct/

23Protection of Customer Information 
We consider protection of customer information not only as
our corporate responsibility but also as vital to winning ourcustomers’ trust. As such, we are strengthening theprocess by which we could better protect such information,and we have a team dedicated to overseeing this matter. 
We analyzed the risk factors in each stage of the customer
information life cycle (collection-storage-transmission-use-disposal). Safeguarding measures have beenformulated for each factor to keep risks at a minimum. We are managing risks from three perspectives - the
management, life cycle and technological perspectives. 
Providing customer information to a third party without
consent is prohibited by law. At SK Telecom, we protectcustomer information through integrated control overcustomer documents and separate storage of our databaseon our former subscribers. Additionally, we ban checking ofcustomer information unless it is job-related and keeprecords of such checks. We also mask personalinformation when customer data are viewed. Theseprocesses have been implemented from 2004. Starting2005, we require SMS certification for checking of voice calllogs, and we send an SMS notice to our customers whenthey sign up for our fee-based value-added services. Wehave also formulated company rules that protect customerinformation and conducted a personal information impactevaluation. Each year, we train  our employees whoseduties are related to our distribution channels and tocustomer information. In 2006, we tightened our controland supervision of our dealers. We visited each of ourdealers and thoroughly inspected how they protect andmanage customer information. Meanwhile, we haveexpanded the target of our personal information impactevaluation to content providers. The evaluation enables usto examine and forecast how customer privacy will beaffected.

24Conclusion of WHO Research on Electromagnetic Radiation Electromagnetic Radiation 
Cell phones, like other electronic products such as TVs,
radios, and cordless phones, emit electromagnetic waves.Much research has been undertaken over the past 60 yearsto find out if electromagnetic radiation is harmful to thehuman body. However, the effect of the electromagneticradiation given off by mobile phones and base stationsremains a subject of debate. Over the 10-year period from1996 to 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) carriedout a research to determine the effect of electromagneticwaves on the human body and on the electromagneticenvironment. At this time, however, concrete proof has yetto be found that electromagnetic radiation from mobilephones causes serious harm. 
Led by the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC),the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute(ETRI), the Korea Electromagnetic Engineering Society (KEES),and the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) took part in a jointresearch on ‘The Effect of Electromagnetic Radiation on theHuman Body’ from 2000 to 2004. The outcome of the first phasewas the same as WHO’s conclusion. SK Telecom contributed a
total of KRW 750 million over five years to support research onelectromagnetic radiation. 
Many years of experiments and research will be necessaryto scientifically prove whether or not electromagneticwaves are indeed harmful, so it is not possible to concludethis issue one way or the other in the near future. For thetime being, international regulatory bodies have presentedguidelines on the level of permissible exposure. 
Electromagnetic Radiation from Base Stations 
The guidelines on electromagnetic waves announced by
MIC in December 2000 are based on the *ICNIRP standard,which is the most stringent in the world. According to themeasurements taken by KEES and RRL, SK Telecom basestations emit 1/10~1/1,000 of the ICNIRP standard. SKTelecom measured electromagnetic radiation on about 40occasions in 2005. All the results showed levels below 1/10of the government standard. 
Electromagnetic Radiation from Mobile
Handsets 
*ICNIRP has published guidelines on the Specific Absorption
Rate (SAR) for electromagnetic radiation emitted frommobile handsets. The standard we adhere to is that exposure(head) must not exceed the 1.6 W/kg SAR limit, as averagedover a 1-gram cube of tissue. This is the same standardapplied in the U.S. and Australia and is the strictest in theworld. In Europe and Japan, the limit is 2.0 W/kg, asaveraged over a 10-gram cube of tissue. SK Telecomprovides services only for handsets that have been verified bythe RRL as meeting the abovementioned standard.  According to recent domestic and overseas researches, wecannot yet conclude that exposure to electromagneticradiation from mobile phones and base stations poses ahealth risk. Still, more in-depth research to assess suchhealth hazards was carried out under WHO’s EMF Project.Across the globe, more than USD 250 million has beeninvested in researches on the health effects ofelectromagnetic waves. It will likely take another two to threeyears before related research is concluded and the results areincorporated in WHO’s health hazards assessment.

Governance GOVERNANCE 
(  Governance ) 
Structure of the Board of Directors
SK Telecom has established a global standard of corporate
governance, operating within a structure whose focal point isthe Board of Directors(BOD). This enhances our transparentand sound management practices that enable corporatesustainability management. As of the end of June 2006, theBoard has eleven directors, seven of whom are independentand from outside the company. (64% of the Board) We ensurethe independence and transparency of the Board through theappointment of an independent director recommended by thePeople’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a prominentnon-governmental organization in Korea which speaks forindividual investors’rights. For two consecutive years in 2005and in 2006, SK Telecom won the corporate governance awardgiven by the Corporate Governance Service, an affiliate of theKorea Exchange (KRX). The award was in recognition of allaspects of SK Telecom’s initiatives to improve corporategovernance, including the support for shareholders’ interests,the active role of the Board of Directors, and the operatingefficiency of the Board and its Audit Committee.
Committees under the BOD
In July 2005, SK Telecom established a new Global
Committee, to review overseas business strategies andinvestments. As of June 2006, SK Telecom has fivecommittees-the Audit Committee, the Independent DirectorRecommendation Committee, the CapEx Review Committee,the Compensation Committee, and the Global Committee.These committees met 21 times in 2005 and 13 times in thefirst half of 2006 to discuss major corporate agendas. CEO as the Chair of the Board
The Board of Directors deliberates and decides on matters
stipulated in regulations and the articles of incorporation andon major issues related to managing the company. Accordingto article 4.2 of the Board of Directors regulations, the CEOserves as the chairman of the Board. As the CEO has thebroadest understanding of business activities across thecompany, having the CEO concurrently serve as the Boardchair allows for efficient operation of the BOD. 
Mechanism for Shareholder/Employee
Recommendations

Securities and Exchange Act, have the right to proposeagenda items to a company’s directors for its generalshareholders’ meeting. In SK Telecom, aside from this, all ofthe company’s stakeholders--including its shareholders andemployees--may directly communicate with its AuditCommittee (one of the committees under the BOD) via theEthical Counseling Center. In August 2006, we set up CEO T-Talk, the company intranet. CEO T-Talk is a forum in whichSK Telecom employees’ ideas and questions and the CEO’sresponse and opinions on important company issues can befreely expressed. It is a venue for transparent communicationon matters of interest to employees.

Public Relations: SK Telecom actively assumes its
social responsibilities.PRMANAGEMENT APPROACH
(  Management Approach ) 
Policy
SK Telecom’s belief in ‘Maximizing happiness’ reflects its
corporate philosophy of maximizing the happiness of itsdiverse stakeholders. Based on this philosophy, we arecommitted to playing a hands-on role and continuallyparticipating in solving social problems throughvolunteerism, rather than making one-time donations orsponsorships. Our system enables our entire company totake part in social contribution activities. Additionally, wepractice ethics management to firmly establish a processand system that enable fair play. We have also introducedand are actively enforcing a compliance program.
Our vision is to become a company that constantly moves
forward through sustained growth and stability; that createsvalue for its customers, employees, and shareholders; andthat plays a key role in the development of society and theeconomy. Our ultimate goal is to bring greater happiness toall. Our people-centered management philosophy is basedon our priority of maximizing the happiness of the greaterpart of society, to which we also belong.
Responsibility
Companies are aligning their social contribution activities
with the fast-changing perception of corporate socialresponsibility. Around the world, we are seeing a shift in thefocus of such activities from ‘charity’ to ‘participation.’ Thebusiness world is doing more than just taking part involunteer work; it is aiming to make a difference byaddressing the root cause of social problems. We are guidedin our social contribution activities by our goal of bringinggreater happiness to all members of society. Going furtherthan merely returning our company profits to society orengaging in one-time charity events, the aim of our socialcontribution program is “To invest in society’ so as to findfundamental solutions to social problems. Our efforts inethics management and fair competition also underline ourdesire to be a trusted member of society.Focused on

Management Approach
Performance
SK Telecom’s social contribution activities focus on creating
a platform for the needy to eventually lead independentlives, rather than giving them temporary help. With theunderstanding that only stable jobs can lead to economicindependence, our company has developed a job trainingprogram in addition to helping create jobs.
Along with other SK affiliates, we have designed a roadmap
for job creation and plan to generate approximately 4,000new jobs in three years, starting from 2005. SK Telecom isalso an active participant in the Habitat for Humanityprogram, which helps build homes for people in need. Ourplans include creating sustainable jobs for 600 people thatcall for preparing and delivering hot lunches for needychildren and the elderly, and training 1,000 educationassistants for disabled students. In addition, we are workingclosely with groups such as the Korean Foundation forWorking Together to receive and provide valid help. Underthe common goal of serving society, this sharing ofexpertise enables those in need to receive systematic andvaried support. It also incites greater public interest insocial issues, resulting in synergies. This, in turn, meansthat a company’s social contribution activities do not end atmerely the corporate level but permeate throughout societyto address the fundamental problems of the needy. Oursocial contribution activities are thus deeply embedded inthe lives of such people since our continued volunteerism ishelping heal feelings of isolation. Our employeevolunteerism remains the basis of our social contributionactivities. In 2004, the SK Telecom Volunteer Group waslaunched to aid the disabled, teenagers, and the elderly whoare living alone, who are suffering not only economic andsocial alienation but also face physical and mentalchallenges.

SK Telecom’s social contribution extends beyond national
borders. In Vietnam, we have been providing free surgeriesto children with facial deformities since 1996. In August2003, we donated funds raised by our company and ourcustomers to Korea Food for the Hungry International tosupport its reconstruction work and meal provisions toelementary schools in Iraq. Since 2004, we have beensupporting a long-term model project for a livestock raisingvillage in Mongolia. We also carried out campaigns to helpregions damaged by the tsunami in Southeast Asia inJanuary 2005, particularly to help with relief efforts in theregion. We used the funds that we and our customers raisedto purchase emergency rescue supplies that we delivered toNGOs that were working on medical support, fooddistribution, and facility reconstruction.  
Overseas Medical Support/Free Surgery for Children
with Facial Deformities in Vietnam
With the Smile for Children organization, SK Telecom has

This activity first came to our attentionwhen the Vietnamese government made a worldwide appealto help children in the country with facial deformities in themid-1990s, which was then a serious social issue inVietnam. SK Telecom and Smile for Children were the firstin Asia to support the movement. On June 17, 2005, SKTelecom celebrated the 10th anniversary of its free surgicaloperations for children with facial deformities in Vietnam atthe Daewoo Hanoi Hotel. Some 20 children who receivedsurgery and their families were invited to the event, duringwhich SK Telecom gave the children scholarships. Global Youth Volunteering Work Project

Telecom started its youth global volunteerism project in2004 to support overseas volunteerism among the youth.This project gives the young opportunities to become awareof global issues such as discrimination, hunger, and theenvironment. In addition, this program allows the youth todirectly experience what it means to carry out volunteerismon a global scale. In 2004, the project took volunteers toMongolia, the Lake Baikal region, Slovakia, and Uzbekistanto support village repair work, help elderly ethnic Koreansliving alone, and provide Korean language education to localchildren.

Ethics Management
56ETHICS MANAGEMENT
(  Ethics Management )
Principles
Ethics management is defined as adhering to economic and
legal responsibilities in doing business and reflecting ethicalstandards widely accepted as social norms in businessdecisions and activities.
Companies’ direct and indirect influence on the national
economy and society have been growing recently in tandemwith the importance of their social responsibility. Existingbusiness practices and customs no longer guaranteecompany survival. Through ethics management, a companycan boost customer preference for its products andservices. Thus, ethics management is an important tool forcorporate competitiveness. SK Telecom is activelyresponding to such changes in the business environmentand is committed to practice transparent and ethicsmanagement that adheres to social norms and ethicalstandards, in addition to SK’s management philosophy ofSKMS (SK Management System).
Ethics Management Organization
SK Telecom established the Ethics Management Office to
pursue its ethics management more effectively in 2004. Theorganization headed by an executive vice president, wasreshuffled to bolster its role and function in 2005.
Code of Ethics
SK Telecom protects its employees from ethical risks
through its Code of Ethics, which provides a standard fortheir conduct and decision-making. Adopted in 2002, ourCode of Ethics contains an outline of the Code, guidelines forits implementation, and a Q&A section.All SK Telecom employees sign a pledge each year to show
their compliance with the company’s Code of Ethics. As of2005, 99% of our employees (excluding our long-termemployees stationed overseas or those on overseas training)had signed and submitted their written pledge to observe ourCode of Ethics.
Promoting Unity through Ethics Management Education
The importance of ethics management is constantly instilled
in SK Telecom employees through ongoing education. Oureducation system features both on- and offline channels. Asof 2005, a total of 2,466 new and existing SK Telecomemployees underwent a total of 33 education sessions, whilean online course was conducted for all our employees(participation rate: 94%). Additionally, CEO letters and in-house broadcasts stress the importance of voluntarilyimplementing ethics management. To promote employeeparticipation, SK Telecom introduced in 2006 a voluntaryethics management system by division so as to come up withmore specific tasks and establish ethical behavior guidelines.

The purpose of SK Telecom’s
ethics management practice isnot simply to point out and punishacts of improper nature andcorruption, but to establish aprocess and system that enablesfair play, so as to ultimatelyincrease value for our various stakeholders including ourcustomers, shareholders, and employees. By instilling in ouremployees the understanding that ethics management is arequisite for the development and continued existence of acompany, we are promoting voluntary participation in ethicsmanagement. SK Telecom’s particular style of ethicsmanagement can be defined by the two characteristics thatfollow. The first characteristic is the establishment of a systemand process that can guarantee the implementation of ethicsmanagement. The second characteristic is the encouragementof the voluntary participation of our stakeholders, including ouremployees, by making them understand that ethicsmanagement is a barometer of global competitiveness and bypromoting it as part of SK Telecom’s corporate culture

Changing the World with Mobile Technology 
Mobile phone services have powered the growth of Korea’s
IT and telecom services industries. They have transformedour daily lives and culture, as well as our national economy.
The mobile telecoms industry is contributing to people’s
incomes not only through the direct effects of its creation ofjobs in the manufacturing and service industries, but alsothrough the indirect effects of its building of a telecomsinfrastructure.
Today, it is hard to imagine life without mobile phones,
which offer navigation systems, mobile banking, and digitalhome services, aside from basic telephony functions. Mobiletelecommunications is a key phrase in ubiquitous networksbecause the number of services and functions being addedonto cell phones is growing at a rapid pace, as are theireffects on our daily lives and related industries.
Mobile World
As of 2006, there are 40 million Korean subscribers to
mobile telecoms services, meaning that 85% of the entireKorean population uses a mobile handset. This highdiffusion rate has led to immense developments in relatedtechnologies and services, changing the way we viewmoving pictures and our society. We are now truly living in amobile world.Creation of Jobs in Services Industry
According to a report by the Institute for Information
Technology Advancement, the mobile telecoms industryinduced production worth KRW 220 trillion from the start ofcommercial CDMA services in 1996 to 2003. The addedvalue and number of jobs created over the same periodwere calculated at KRW 83 trillion and 2.13 million jobs,respectively. In terms of employment, 1.66 million jobswere created in the equipment industry and 460,000 in theservice industry.
Spillover Effect in Equipment Industry
Mobile telecommuni-
cations also ushered inmajor changes in themanufacturing industry.The number of companiesproducing handset-relatedgoods, including display,antenna, PCB, and moldingcompanies, was estimatedat 900 as of 2004.
Thanks to the high quality of Korea’s mobile telecoms
services market, the competitiveness of its equipmentexports has risen to the extent that Korean products nowaccount for approximately 26% of the global mobile handsetmarket. Handsets account for 8.3% of Korea’s total exports,ranking third only to semiconductors and automobiles.

Design Convergence
With the evolution of mobile phones from luxury items to
basic necessities, even to becoming the representativedevice of digital convergence, they have taken on a vastarray of additional functions. The GPS system, electronicwallets, MP3 players, video players, digital cameras, andgame machines are among the other mobile phonefunctions and services that are currently available in themarket. The mobile phone is now able to replace four to fivemobile devices.
Mobile phones are expected to take on a greater role as a
personal handhold information device, with the addedfunction of telematics.Mobile Digital Media Contents Market
In just a year, sales of mobile music soared by 29.3% from
KRW 176.7 billion in 2003 to KRW 228.5 billion in 2004.
Despite the continued slide in offline album sales due to
piracy and free, streaming music sites, the mobile musicmarket has been able to secure stable profits, and itsgrowth potential is regarded as highly promising.
In addition, the mobile game market is showing fast gains,
leading to forecasts of greater demand for mobile digitalcontents.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
(  Management Approach ) 
Policy
SK Telecom aspires to create a future in which everyone can
lead happy and fulfilling lives in a pleasant and abundantenvironment. Our business activities are led by ourdedication to pass on a clean and well-preservedenvironment to future generations. Environmentalmanagement has become integral to maintainingcompetitiveness on the global stage. SK Telecom isproactively responding to this trend, and towards this end,we have selected environmental management as one of ourkey mid-term initiatives. 
In general, the service sector, which includes the telecoms
industry, has less impact on the environment compared tothe manufacturing industry. SK Telecom is well aware,however, that its activities do have an effect on theenvironment, no matter how small such effect may be. Theenvironmental impacts of the telecoms service industryinclude gas emissions from the use of energy to run motorvehicles and offices, and the generation of waste handsetswith customers’ replacement of their old cell phones. 
On the other hand, some of our services help reduce the
emission of pollutants. Services such as wirelesscommunications, mobile banking, and mobile bookstoreeliminate the need for customers to move from one place toanother, resulting in less traffic pollution. Nate Drive, ournavigation service, informs users of the fastest travel route,thereby reducing traffic time. Mobile services based on newtechnologies help conserve energy while enhancingcustomer satisfaction. 
We will not be complacent on environmental issues under
the belief that the telecoms service sector has a relativelysmaller impact on the ecosystem than other industries. Inaddition to energy conservation, we will work to minimizeany negative effect we may have on the environment and todevelop eco-friendly services. Environmental managementholds the key to our promotion of a rich and fulfilling life forour customers, shareholders, employees, and communities.These stakeholders, in turn, form the foundation ofsustainable development and the survival of our business. Awards
Grand Prize in the Jeju Eco-friendly Base Station
Contest
SK Telecom received the Grand
Prize at the Jeju Eco-friendly BaseStation Contest for the secondstraight year in 2004. This contest
is organized by the Jeju Regional Communications Office toreduce the environmental damage caused by the installationof base stations and to maintain the natural beauty of theJeju region. SK Telecom’s shield kite base station was thefirst of its kind to be set up in Jeju Island. The sculpture,shaped like a shield kite, a traditional kite of Korea, receivedgood reviews from the competition’s judges.

Responsibility
The major adverse consequences on the environment of SK
Telecom’s business activities are as follows: 
�Emission of greenhouse gases from the use of energy tooperate our network, offices, and motor vehicles; 
�Waste materials generated by our offices, branches, andnetwork operations; 
�Waste handsets from our sale of mobile phones; 
�Environmental damage related to our installation of basestations and repeaters; and 
�Refrigerants and fire extinguishers containing substancesthat deplete the ozone layer.  
SK Telecom makes every effort to comply with
environmental laws and regulations. Our environmentalmanagement system is broadly classified into three areas.One is the network category, which encompasses networksetup and operation, including base stations. The second isthe customer category, which covers matters related tohandset sourcing and sales. Lastly, the business supportarea oversees matters regarding our office space andcompany automobiles. ղ૑1.ಕ੉૑Environment
Resource Conservation & Recycling

(  Resource Conservation & Recycling ) 
Handset Recycling
SK Telecom does not engage in the manufacturing of mobile
phones, but we do oversee a distribution network that sellsthe handsets. As cell phones have a relatively short lifespan, we have maintained a keen interest in recyclinghandsets as a means of conserving resources andprotecTing the environment. 
SK Telecom retrieved 2,105 thousand used handsets in
2005. The figure is equivalent to 28% of the new handsetssold during the year. The retrieval rate was higher thanusual in 2004 as it was the first year that the mobile numberportability (MNP) scheme went into effect. To retainsubscribers in the face of MNP, we reinforced our handsettrade-in policy. Among the total retrievals in 2005, 74% weresold to SK Networks on the condition that they are exportedoverseas. Around 4% were recycled as handsets for lease,while 22% were sold to a waste handset recycling firmdesignated by the Association of Electronics Environment.The designated firm crushes waste handsets and sends
metal parts tosmelters to berecycled. 
Previously, SK
Telecom gave allits customers theoption of trading intheir old handsetsfor new models. However, this system could be misconstrued asa form of handset subsidy. Therefore, starting in May 2006, wehave been recommending to our customers who receivedhandset subsidies from us to voluntarily return their old modelsto us when switching to a new phone. Electronic Billing
An average of three A4 sheets goes into making one paper
bill. To use less paper, SK Telecom has an e-mail billingsystem (via the Internet) and an M billing system (via textmessages on cell phones). As of the end of 2005, 2,243thousand of our subscribers received their bills via e-mailand 936 thousand signed up for the M billing service. Thesebilling systems have lowered annual paper usage by anestimated 916 tons. 
Moving Toward a Paperless Company
The pursuit of ‘creating a paperless company to bolster
operational efficiency ’has been selected as one of the Six Sigma
tasks led by the CEO. The objective is to do away with wastefuluse of resources and personnel by improving the reportpreparation process. The anticipated benefit is annual reductionof about 3.8 million sheets of paper and about 190 toners.
Support for Beautiful Flea Market
The Beautiful Flea Market is a place where sellers
contribute a part of their profits to meaningful causes andvisitors donate recycled products instead of paying anentrance fee. It is a venue where people come to share andcare for the environment. SK Telecom is promoting theconcept of recycling through its support for the BeautifulFlea Market. 
Treatment of Waste Materials
In 2005, garbage from SK Telecom workplaces nationwide
amounted to 6.037 thousand liters excluding items that wererecycled. All garbage was treated by waste treatmentagencies designated by regional governing bodies. Networkequipment and consumables such as UPS, air conditionersand batteries are either sold or scrapped. Scrapped materialsare handled by relevant companies designated by the city.  4,500

Standardization of Cell Phone Peripherals
Prior to 2002, rechargers varied from one manufacturer to
another and from one model to the next. This incompatibilitycreated inconvenience for cell phone users--the need to buy anew recharger with the purchase of a new device increased thecost burden on customers. At the same time, obsoleterechargers implied a waste of resources and environmentalpollution. SK Telecom has been working to standardize cellphone rechargers since the second half of 2002. The newmodels we launched from 2003 were fitted with a standardizedrecharging input/output terminal. For new models that welaunched after the release of our standardized rechargers, therechargers were sold separately from the handset, for addedcustomer convenience and less waste. 
SK Telecom is also moving to standardize memory cards and
earphones. For memory cards, a trial handset was launched in thelatter half of 2006 and standardized memory cards will be appliedto a wider variety of models from 2007. We launched our earphonestandardization initiative in 2005 and launched a standardizationcommittee comprising carriers, TTAs, and manufacturers. Ourtarget is to release a handset with standardized earphones in2007. Standardized earphones will eliminate the need to buy newones upon the purchase of a new handset.
Use of Clean Energy
We have adopted environment-friendly lithium polymer
batteries for standby power in our optical repeaters.Beginning in 2006, we will replace our lead storage batterieswith lithium polymer batteries in phases. We expect to usethe eco-friendly batteries in about 84% of our new opticalrepeaters in 2006. Inclusion of Anti-UV PVC (poly vinyl chloride) in
*Radome Standard 
When reporting the standard for new Wibro antennas, SK
Telecom plans to add on anti-UV PVC, which is easier todispose of and recycle compared to *FRP. 
Reducing Harmful Gas Emissions 
As of the end of June 2006, SK Telecom operated a total of
548 motor vehicles, of which 168 are company-owned and380 are leased. While 364 of them, or 66% of the total, runon gasoline, 184 (34%) run on diesel. Separately, another686 automobiles are used by our business partners inrelation to maintaining and repairing our base stations. Tominimize the environmental pollution caused by car exhaustemission, SK Telecom plans to replace the diesel-poweredcars managed by the company with vehicles that complywith Euro 4 (one of the stages related to European emissionstandards). Down the road, we plan to request our businesspartners to make the same switch for their diesel-poweredcars. 
*F-OTA
We are in the process of developing a function that will
enable our customers to receive software upgrades formobile communications devices through wireless Internet.Our aim is to launch a device with that function in 2006.Firmware upgrade via the Internet will remove the need forour service users to go to after-sales service centers, whichwill result in savings in time and energy.

Our Response to Global Warming 
International efforts to prevent global warming have been
gaining pace since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted at thethird session of the Conference of Parties (COP) during theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange(UNFCCC) in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. Theissue has received weaker attention in Korea, which is not inthe list of countries obligated to reduce GHG emissionsunder the Kyoto Protocol. While we acknowledge that morecan be done, we are working to reduce our greenhouse gasemissions to fulfill our responsibilities as a global corporatecitizen. We are taking action to reduce our energyconsumption in our base stations and offices so as to curbour generation of carbon dioxide (CO
2), one of the main
greenhouse gases. We are also reviewing plans to replacethe halon fire extinguishers at our base stations andswitching centers with eco-friendly ones. 
CO 2Emission Survey 
SK Telecom conducted a study to assess the amount of the
major energy sources consumed at our domestic worksites,and converted the data to CO
2 emission. This study covered
only our office space. We plan to set up a system to measureemissions from our motor vehicles and other sources in thenear future. The total amount of CO
2emitted by our
workplaces in 2005 was 321 thousand tons. Indirectemission from electricity accounted for 95.5% of the total.  Energy Consumption
Electric Power
Electric power is SK Telecom’s primary energy source. In
2005, our electricity consumption totaled 635 thousandMWh, which accounted for an increase of 12% over theprevious year. Of the total, 237 thousand MWh (37%) wasconsumed in our offices while 398 thousand MWh (63%)went towards operating our base stations locatednationwide. Although gross floor area of our officeincreased, our energy consumption per square meter, ameasure of energy efficiency, is on a downward trend. Theunusually sharp rise in 2004 was caused by a large increasein the number of our equipment for value-added servicessuch as Cyworld. The figure dropped by 12% year-on-year to375 kWh/m

Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) 
SK Telecom consumed a total of 5,178,000m3of LNG in 2005.
This full amount powered our heating and cooling devices. Ourtotal consumption is increasing, but our ongoing conservationefforts are keeping our LNG use per square meter on adeclining path. Oil
Our oil consumption reached 598 thousand liters in 2005.
We us oil in our emergency power supply systems forheating devices in our offices. While we use eco-friendlyLNG to run our heating/cooling devices, we unavoidably usediesel in regions that do not have access to LNG supply. 
Energy Conservation Efforts
Office Energy Consumption
SK Telecom uses electricity, gas, and oil as sources of
energy. Our efforts to reduce our energy consumptioninclude our use of economizers for air conditioning, ouradjustment of the mix of air and fuel in the burners of ourHVAC systems, our use of new humidifiers and low-temperature HVAC systems, and our temperaturedifferential. In 2005, we realized annual savings of 8,195MWh in power usage, which corresponds to 3,963 CO
2tons
in terms of CO 2emission. We also encourage outside
companies that maintain our facilities to help us saveenergy through a suggestion scheme. Since we introducedthis scheme in 1999, we have received and implemented 255suggestions on ways to use less energy. 4,6704,3575,1788.28.99.5

�Year-round air conditioning is necessary at SK Telecom buildings due to switching centers.
�Using electric- and gas-powered air conditioning systems
�Using economizer to use cold outside air for cooling in the winter to save on energy consumption
�Operating boilers and cooling devices for HVAC and water heating.
�Boilers and gas-powered cooling devices contain burners. The air and fuel mix is adjusted once
a year to maximize operating efficiency of burners. 
�Humidifiers are used to maintain humidity at around 50% in winter. 
�Previously humidifiers with electric heaters were used to evaporate water, requiring large
amounts of energy. 
�The above were replaced with humidifiers that cause water to evaporate when it comes into
contact with air from 2003, leading to less energy usage.
�To reduce costs, we keep our air temperature about 5 ℃lower than that in regular buildings
when  our cooling system is in use (less cost to operate ventilators)
�Regular buildings: 15 ℃, SK T-Tower: 10 ℃
�To reduce costs, we keep our cold water temperature about 4 ℃higher/lower than that in

SK Telecom’s ‘Customer Exploratorium Outlet ’received a
Distinguished Service Medal from the Ministry of Cultureand Tourism in June 2006 for its design excellence, eco-friendliness, and energy efficiency. The signboard at theoutlet has an outstanding design that suits well the urbanstreet culture and reduces visual disturbance by minimizinginternal and external lighting. It also reduces environmentalpollution, as it is made of recyclable materials with strongdurability. In addition, the signboard minimizes lightingeffects, meaning it consumes 75% less power than aconventional signboard.
High-Efficiency Equipment 
Replacing old telecommunications equipment with new
models that require less electricity is another way by whichSK Telecom is conserving energy. Our annual savings fromour adoption of new equipment is 5,431 MWh, based on ourmaximum output. Converted to CO
2emission, the figure
becomes 2,627 CO 2tons. 
Flexible Equipment Operation 
Cellular service call volume exhibits a high degree of
seasonality. The volume peaks in November and December.SK Telecom has adopted a flexible operating system fortelecoms equipment that run based on the peak season(yearend) call volume. When there is leeway, power is shutoff on certain equipment to curb electricity consumption. While the number of facilities we operate has increased, our
average operating cost per facility is decreasing, thanks toour energy and cost saving efforts. Our average operatingcost fell by 9.2% in 2005 from a year earlier. We expectanother decline of 8.3% in 2006. 
Teleconference and Conference Call 
SK Telecom actively uses teleconferencing and conference
calls to curtail its expenses and energy consumption arisingfrom business trips. In 2005, we held 61 teleconferences inwhich 8,935 people took part. 
We also use teleconferencing and conference calls for
transactions related to our overseas businesses such as inthe U.S., China, Japan, Vietnam, and India.

Mobile Telecom Facilities in Environmental
Conservation Zones 
SK Telecom has 50 base stations and 104 repeaters located
in ecosystem conservation zones (27 regions, 293.545 ㎢)
and wetland conservation zones (15 regions, 186.59 ㎢)
designated by the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry ofMaritime Affairs and Fisheries, and local government units.We set up 20 base stations and 28 repeaters in existingleisure facilities such as shelters, mountain lodges, andstores, which do not affect the environment. This means weset up our remaining 30 base stations and 76 repeaters inecosystem and wetland conservation zones. These were setup to meet the telecom needs of people traveling throughsuch regions and to assist in rescue operations in case ofemergencies such as natural disasters. We are sparing noeffort to minimize the environmental impact of ourequipment in conservation zones. 
Sharing of Eco-friendly Wireless and Base
Stations
To proactively respond to stronger calls from the
government for network sharing and adoption of lawsrequiring eco-friendly wireless stations, SK Telecom formeda working group in November 2005 to set up eco-friendlywireless stations. The group, which is composed of 21teams from 7 divisions at SK Telecom, is divided into threesubgroups. Its duties are to formulate standards for eco-friendly wireless stations, to map out the company’s futuredirection on environmental issues, to form eco-friendlymodels, and to promote the development of green materialsand process standardization, among others. As of the end of2005, SK Telecom had about 6,700 eco-friendly wirelessstations, which represent 21% of our network. We havepursued open wireless stations since the fourth quarter of2002, and they now number about 13,000 (42% of allwireless stations in Korea) as of the end of 2005. Sharing ofwireless stations is intended to prevent redundantinvestments by telecoms carriers and to curb costs. Theinitiative is estimated to have reduced environmental impactover an area of about 216,000
㎡.In the future, when setting up new wireless stations, SK
Telecom will classify areas into three categories (commonzone, eco-friendly zone, eco-friendly common zone), andwill draw up separate standards for each zone. We will alsogive due consideration to the efficient utilization of wirelessfacilities and environmental protection. 
Water Quality Preservation 
Water usage at SK Telecom totaled 674,000 ㎡in 2005, which
went towards operating sanitation facilities and coolingdevices. As we do not need water to run our base stations,we do not generate sewage or waste water from ournetwork operations. To prevent damage from the sewagefrom our offices, we have installed sewage treatmentfacilities. 
Green Map Grand Journey 
The Green Map Grand Journey takes participants from the
east coast to the west and southern coasts so that they canexperience nature and observe the extent of pollution. Itcontributes to preserving our natural surroundings byraising public awareness of coastal pollution through avariety of activities. Data compiled during the outings areutilized by related agencies. About 100 persons took part inour Green Map Grand Journey in 2005, including volunteers,representatives from Green Korea, and regionalenvironmental experts. The event took them to Uljin,Youngdeok, Ulsan, Busan, Geoje, Suncheon, Goheung,Jindo, Gochang, and Buan to get a closer look atenvironmental issues affecting coastal areas in Korea. Theventure included numerous activities such as pollutionassessment (measurement of water and air quality), wastematerial monitoring, a public environmental campaign, acoastal cleanup, and visits to eco-system conservationzones.

Comment from External ExpertCOMMENT FROM EXTERNAL EXPERT
A new wind is sweeping through the global corporate scene - the wind of corporate sustainability
management (CSM) or corporate social responsibility (CSR). This trend is extending its reach to thebusiness world in Korea.
It is welcome news that a major corporation such as SK Telecom is advocating CSM with respect to
its economic, environmental, and social aspects, and openly communicating and reporting suchprocess to its diverse stakeholders.
SK Telecom’s Sustainability Report is based on GRI guidelines. While observing international
standards, this Report also retains the company’s unique features. I hope this Sustainability Reportwill have a meaningful impact on other companies and will spur an even greater wave of CSR inKorea. I hope this tide will lead to a vast social integration, in which businesses will fulfill their socialresponsibilities while consumers and the public can trust and respect the corporate sector. That, inturn, should empower Korean corporations to be competitive on the global stage.

As apart of this, SK Telecom has operated various communication channels with stakeholders and has recognized the Issuesby these channels. And all the identified issues and concerns were controlled through feedback process and many socialcontribution activities were promoted with government and citizen communities.

Preparation Guideline (ver.3) by GRI, to raise SK Telecom's efforts and performance. Also, we recommend expandingSustainability activities considering SK Telecom's social affection to resolve social/environmental issues caused by growthof mobile communication service sector. 
Lastly, We suggest further elevation the report to fully accommodate the three principles provided by the AA1000(materiality,
completeness and responsiveness) by establishing systematic communication with various stakeholders.
