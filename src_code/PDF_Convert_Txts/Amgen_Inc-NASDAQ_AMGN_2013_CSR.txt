Amgen 2013 Environmental Sustainability Highlights
2
Robert A. Bradway  
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Leadership Message
Amgen ensures we live up to our commitment to 
environmental sustainability by establishing a multi-year plan with clear metrics to track our progress. Through our first environmental sustainability plan, we realized more than $24 million in cost savings and exceeded targets for conservation, even as our operations grew. In 2013, we embarked on a new environmental sustainability plan with more ambitious conservation targets. These include aspirations to reduce facility carbon emissions by 10 percent and disposed waste by 35 percent from a 2012 baseline. This plan aims to thoroughly integrate principles of environmental sustainability into the development of our medicines from early research to the market. In 2013, we were also recognized externally for our results. Ranked among the best performers in biotechnology, Amgen was listed on the 2013 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index (DJSI).  
Amgen is widely recognized as a leader in biologics 
manufacturing and we continue to advance our capabilities in this area. We broke ground in 2013 in Singapore on a facility that will help transform manufacturing processes at Amgen. We expect the facility will enable us to be faster, more flexible, and more efficient in reaching patients, while also reducing the environmental impact of the manufacturing of our products. When up and running, this facility will join existing efforts in both biologic and synthetic molecule research and development to make us more agile and environmentally responsible as a company. 
Beyond the specific actions we’ve taken as a company, 
our staff continue to demonstrate their passion for the environment through innovative thinking on the job and volunteer work in the community. We support staff safety with a pervasive focus on creating a safe work environment, and we promote staff wellness with a range of programs that encourage physical and mental health. 
Taking a path to be a more environmentally sustainable 
company has been a revealing and productive journey. Thank you for following our progress through our environmental sustainability reporting. We value your input and invite you to share your thoughts through the feedback link of the report website.

*Currently showing progress for US sales fleet. Baseline is being established for sales fleet outside the US, which will be integrated into target.19,000 m3We achieved all of our 2012 environmental targets—energy, carbon dioxide, water, waste recycling, waste reduction, 
and the fuel efficiency of our US sales fleet—saving more than $24 million in operating costs and strengthening our business in the process. From this foundation, we have set new goals for 2020 in the areas of facility carbon emissions, fleet carbon emissions, disposed waste reduction, and water use. The overall aim of our 2020 targets  
is to protect the environment, improve efficiency, and increase shareholder value.4
In 2013, we embarked on our 2020 plan for environmental sustainability. We continue to integrate 
environmental sustainability practices throughout our company’s operations—from research and manufacturing practices to the design and construction of facilities.

along with improved practices and processes for research and manufacturing are making a significant difference for energy use and carbon emissions at Amgen.Sustainability in Action
2020 Plan Drives Sustainable Practices  
Throughout the Value Chain
Amgen has a new 2020 plan for environmental sustainability focused on driving sustainable practices in the areas of research, development, and manufacturing; transportation and distribution; commercial operations; sourcing; and products and packaging. By integrating sustainability practices during the design process, we are achieving further efficiencies in our business while continuing to reduce our impact on the environment. Our success depends on the creativity and resourcefulness of our staff who demonstrate their commitment to the environment both at work and in their communities.
Technology Tames Energy Drain
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are Amgen’s most significant energy users, contributing more than 50 percent of the company’s total energy/carbon–related emissions. Engineers at our corporate headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California, upgraded the old chilled water/air conditioning system and installed a new automation system with real-time control, resulting in a 40 percent increase in energy efficiency for the site. With this change alone, Amgen is saving more than 28,000 gigajoules of energy and keeping 2,197 metric tons of carbon out of the environment. The local utility company, Southern California Edison, rewarded Amgen with a $1.3 million incentive for this innovation. Reducing Waste Can Be Dirty WorkDigging through the trash is not a typical task at Amgen, but in 2013, staff at some of our largest sites pulled on gloves, poured out the contents of trash and recycling bins, and documented what they found. They used evidence from these trash audits to discover new ways to improve recycling rates and reduce waste, such as by reducing the use of disposable mop heads. Some findings pointed to the need for clearer signage or better systems to encourage staff to use the composting and recycling bins appropriately.
Reducing the Environmental Footprint 
of Research and Manufacturing
New facilities, along with improved practices and 
processes for research and manufacturing, are making a significant difference for energy use and carbon emissions at Amgen. Our drug product manufacturing building in Puerto Rico earned Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification for conservation benefits. Other facilities for filling medicines into delivery devices and vials are being built to similar green specifications. A facility under construction in Singapore for biologics manufacturing will have a one-third smaller footprint compared with traditional facilities. 
Amgen continues to build on green practices for both 
biologic and synthetic molecule research and manufacturing. These practices improve our ability to speed medicines to patients while reducing our environmental impact. 5
Volunteering for the Environment 
Amgen has had longstanding participation in environmental volunteering activities that grows larger each year. 2013 was the company’s sixth year to engage in the world’s largest volunteer event to protect waterways and ocean health—the International Coastal Cleanup. Colleagues from sites in Puerto Rico, Washington, British Columbia, California (San Francisco and Thousand Oaks), and Rhode Island removed nearly four metric tons of debris from beaches and inland waterways. In a similar science-based environmental volunteering activity, an Amgen engineer earned a 2013 Amgen Excellence in Volunteering Award (and a donation from Amgen Foundation to the nonprofit Reef Check) for his efforts to survey reef sites and collect data on marine life while scuba diving along the coast of Southern California for Reef Check. 
Over the past four years, staff members from Thousand 
Oaks, California, have made numerous treks to Anacapa Island in California’s Channel Islands to remove non-native, invasive ice plants and restore the area with native plants that support the island’s ecosystem. The National Parks Service recognized Amgen staff in a public ceremony for volunteer efforts in 2013 on Anacapa. The Amgen Foundation Supports the EnvironmentThe Amgen Foundation supported a special initiative in conjunction with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s Five Star and Urban Waters Restoration Grant program in 2013. The initiative combined volunteering opportunities for staff that support community-based wetland, riparian and coastal habitat restoration projects in areas near many of Amgen’s North American sites with funding focused on water conservation and protection. The Foundation also made grants to the EarthCorps Stewardship Volunteers and the Washington Trails Association Youth Trail Stewardship programs. 
See the Amgen Foundation area under Corporate Giving at 
www.amgen.com for more information on the wide variety of nonprofits the Foundation supports in communities across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Europe.Amgen makes an impact in the communities in which we operate through direct volunteer work by staff 
members and through financial support from the Amgen Foundation. We are a good neighbor in the communities where we work and live.

CarbonConserving Resources
Conserving energy allows us to retain more financial resources for our 
core business while reducing carbon emissions. Our strategy has been to complete utilities projects that provide substantial returns for both energy savings and carbon reduction across our network of facilities around the world. In recent years, as we approach new construction projects, we have been building sustainable practices and technology into office and manufacturing facilities from the ground up. Energy conservation and carbon reduction projects have saved our company more than $20 million in cost savings and reduced carbon emissions by 92,000 metric tons since 2007.
We set a new carbon-reduction target related to our sales fleet for 
2020. We continue to expand the range of fuel-efficient vehicle choices available for mobile staff—rotating vehicles that are less fuel efficient out of the fleet for more efficient options.

Reducing Waste, Saving Water
Amgen’s recycling rate has gone from 35 percent in 2007 to 51 
percent in 2013, with a slight decrease in the past two years. To improve both our recycling program and waste reduction efforts we conducted waste audits at our largest sites in 2013. We’re using data from these audits to shape future initiatives for recycling and waste reduction.
Amgen conserves water primarily with a wastewater treatment 
plant in Puerto Rico, which has enabled an average of 74 percent of the treated wastewater to be recycled on-site each year, and with low-water landscaping and smart-irrigation controls at a variety of facilities. In 2013, we developed water maps for each of our sites, following the flow of water through the site to its exit point. These studies help us understand our most significant water users and identify new opportunities for reclamation and reuse of water.

Environmental Notices of Violation (NOVs) (w) # NOV 8 3 2 2 2Summary of Data—Notes
(a)Amgen has included data from 15 facilities covering energy and carbon, water, and waste. The facilities represent approximately 94 percent of Amgen’s worldwide facility space based on 
total square feet. Included facilities are in Thousand Oaks, California, US; Greenwich, Rhode Island, US; Boulder and Longmont, Colorado, US; Seattle and Bothell, Washington, US; Juncos, Puerto Rico, US; Louisville, Kentucky, US; South San Francisco, California, US; Cambridge and Woburn, Massachusetts, US; Burnaby, Canada; Breda, Netherlands; Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; and Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge, United Kingdom. This includes leased buildings where we have operational control over building infrastructure, including utilities. In 2011, Amgen divested of its Fremont, California, facility and acquired facilities in Dun Laoghaire, Woburn, and São Paulo. In 2012, Amgen acquired four companies: Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, deCODE genetics, and Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals. In 2013 Amgen acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals. In our 2013 report, data beginning in May 2011 through the end of 2013 will be included from our Dun Laoghaire facility, which we purchased in May 2011. Data will be included from our Woburn and Abingdon facilities beginning in March 2011 through the end of 2013. No data will be included for our São Paulo facility or for Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, deCODE genetics, Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals, or Onyx Pharmaceuticals in this report, as we are still working through the integration process for these facilities.
(b)Measurement and verification of conservation and reduction projects for energy and carbon, water, and waste are based on adaptation of the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings Volume 1, EVO 10000-1.2007, April 2007. Project measurements are conducted using reasonable means, including direct measurements and scientific estimations as appropriate.
(c) Small changes to 2007–13 data may have occurred due to refinements in calculations. All changes have been confirmed through a documented change control process.
(d)Direct energy use results from the operation of equipment that is owned or controlled by Amgen at the facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of natural gas, propane, and diesel in boilers, furnaces, and HVAC are recorded from utility bills or purchase records. Data on the use of diesel in emergency generators are recorded from purchase records or meter readings and, in some cases, estimated from run-hours. Utility bills recorded in units of volume are converted to energy by using the Global Reporting Initiative Version 3.0, EN3 table, to convert volumes of primary sources (natural gas, diesel), or from specific fuel analysis data (diesel used in Juncos, Puerto Rico), and the US Energy Information Administration/Annual Energy Review Table A1 (propane). Energy from emergency generators recorded as run-hours is estimated using the manufacturer’s specified fuel-feed rate for each generator.
(e)Indirect energy use results from purchased energy in the forms of electricity and steam at the Amgen facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of electricity and steam are recorded from utility bills. Utility bills for purchased steam that are recorded in units of mass (i.e., ‘lb steam’) are converted to energy by using the latent heat of evaporation from the saturated steam tables, then dividing by the efficiency of the supplier’s steam generator.
(f)Scope 1 carbon emissions result from direct energy sources defined in note (d). Additional Scope 1 Carbon emissions from our US sales fleet, executive air fleet, and fugitive emissions from chillers, coolers, and HVAC are found in the Other Carbon category in this data summary. Carbon data from natural gas sources are calculated using regional specific emission factors from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 (US weighted average) for all US sites; from the Ireland UFCCC for Amgen’s facility in Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; from U.K. Defra/DECC’s 110819 Guidelines for Amgen’s facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge); from the NL Agency standard CO2 emission factors for Amgen’s facility in the Netherlands (Breda); and from the Methodology for Reporting 2013 /Ministry of Environment Victoria, BC, 2013, for Amgen’s facility in Burnaby, Canada. Carbon emissions data from propane and diesel fuel sources (except Amgen’s facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico) are calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (August 2012). Carbon from diesel use in Amgen’s Juncos, Puerto Rico, facility are calculated using specific fuel analysis information and from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-1. Carbon data from direct energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (Jul 2009). Scope 1 emissions that are not included in this data summary include process-related emissions from cell respiration (carbon as a by-product) and pH adjustments (CO2 injection). Analysis of these sources in 2013 showed that cell respiration and emissions from pH adjustments are negligible (less than 0.1 percent of our total carbon emissions). 
(g)Scope 2 carbon emissions result from indirect energy sources defined in note (e). Carbon data from purchased electricity are calculated using emission factors from US EPA eGRID 9th Edition Version 1 (2010 data: eGRID subregion annual carbon output emission rate) for all US locations except Amgen’s facility in Puerto Rico which has been determined using EPA GHG Report YE 2012 for Power Suppliers in Puerto Rico; from the Greenhouse Gas Division, Environment Canada (2006 data)-V.1.0 (April 2009) for Amgen’s facility in Burnaby, Canada; and from specific utility annual providers’ reports for Amgen facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge), the Netherlands (Breda), and Dun Laoghaire, Ireland. Carbon data from purchased steam are calculated using the Emission Factor for Natural Gas as identified in US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 (US weighted average) for Amgen’s facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Carbon data from indirect energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission factors from US EPA eGRID2007 Version 1.1 for US facilities.
(h)The Other Carbon category contains additional Scope 1 and Scope 3 carbon emissions that are tracked. Carbon emissions from our executive air fleet are calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Transport-Fuel-Use (August 2012). Carbon emissions from our US sales fleet are calculated using emission factors from the GHG Protocol Emission Factors for Petrol passenger cars (volume) (GHG Protocol) = 8.81 kg/gal. Fuel use and mileage data are collected at the pump for each vehicle. Carbon emissions from our commercial business travel are calculated by Amgen’s travel provider using the Defra tool. Carbon emissions from Amgen’s material transportation have been provided by the carrier using its own specific methods. Fugitive emissions from process equipment (e.g., refrigerant from refrigeration and HVAC equipment) are calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Transport-Fuel-Use (August 2012). Processes are in place to maintain chillers, coolers, and HVAC equipment to prevent unintended emissions.
(i)Scope 3 carbon emissions are a consequence of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company. Scope 3 carbon emissions that are currently tracked include emissions from Amgen’s commercial business travel (air and rail) and material transportation.
(j)Commercial business travel was not tracked in 2007 or 2008. Material transportation was not tracked from 2007 to 2011. The accuracy of carbon emissions tracking from chillers, coolers, and HVAC improved in 2013 and will now be reported going forward.
(k) Slight discrepancy between values for total water fate and total water withdrawal is due to rounding and compilation of individual facility totals.
(l)Recycling rate is the proportion of waste that is recycled, composted, and reused compared with the total volume of routine, nonhazardous and hazardous waste generated. Diversion from landfill is the proportion of waste that is incinerated (both for energy recovery and not), landfilled, and treated compared with the total routine, nonhazardous waste generated.
(m)Treatment means the physical, thermal, chemical, or biological processes that change the characteristics of the waste in order to reduce its volume or hazardous nature, facilitate its handling, or enhance recovery.
(n) Nonroutine waste constitutes waste generated outside the normal operations of our facilities and consists mainly of construction and demolition waste.General

INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT 
Introduction and objectives of work  Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. (BVNA) has been engaged by Amgen to conduct an independent 
assurance of selected environmental data included in Amgen’s 2013 Environmental Sustainability Report. 
This Assurance Statement applies to the related information included within the scope of work described 
below.  
The data presented in Amgen’s 2013 Environmental Sustai nability Report is the sole responsibility of the 
management of Amgen.  BVNA was not involved in the dr afting of the Report.  Our sole responsibility was 
to provide independent verification of the accuracy of selected information included in the Report.  
Scope of work
Amgen requested BVNA to verify the accuracy of the following environmental health and safety data 
summarized in Amgen’s Environmental Sustainability Repo rt for the Calendar Year 2013 reporting period:  
 Energy Use (Total, Direct and Indirect) 
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Direct Scope 1 and Indirect Scope 2)  
 Water Withdrawal and Fate 
 Waste Quantities and Disposition 
 Injury and Illness Rate (Number of inju ries and illnesses per 100 staff members) 
 Lost Day Rate (Number of injuries with da ys away from work per 100 staff members) 
 Severity Rate (Number of days away  from work per 100 staff members) 
 Number of Environmental Violations 
Excluded from the scope of our work is any verification of information relating to: 
 Text or other written stat ements associated with Amgen’s 2013 Environmental Sustainability 
Report 
 Activities outside the defined verification period of Calendar Year 2013 
Methodology  
As part of its independent verification, BVNA undertook the following activities:  
1. Interviews with relevant personnel of Am gen regarding data collection and reporting systems; 
2. Review of Amgen’s data and information system s and methodology for collection, aggregation, 
analysis and internal audit of information used to determine the environmental data; 
3. Review of documentary evidence produced by Amgen;  
4. Audit of Amgen’s data traced ba ck to the source fo r research and developm ent facilities located 
in Seattle, Washington and Bothell, Washington during a site visit to the Seattle site; and 
5. Review of the centralized data,  methods for consolidation of si te data and site data available in 
the centralized data management system during a visit to Amgen’s headquarters location in 
Thousand Oaks, California. 
Our assurance work was conducted in accordanc e with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 and ISO Standar d 14064-3 Greenhouse gases - Pa rt 3: Specification with 
Guidance for the Validation and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Assertions. In accordance with our 
internal procedures for limited assurance, we use these as our reference standards.  17Amgen Page 2 
The work was planned and carried out to provide data verification to a limited assurance level and we 
believe it provides an appropriate basis for our conclusions. 
Our findings    
On the basis of our methodology an d the activities described above: 
 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate t hat the reviewed information within the scope of 
our verification is not materially correct. 
 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed information is not a fair 
representation of the actual environmental and heal th and safety data for calendar year 2013.  
 It is our opinion that Amgen has established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation 
and analysis of quantitative data, including energy use, direct and indirect GHG emissions, water 
withdrawal and fate, waste quantities and disposition, injury and illness rate, lost day rate, 
severity rate and number of environmental violations.  
Statement of independence, impartiality and competence 
BVNA is part of The Bureau Veritas Group, an i ndependent professional services company that 
specializes in Quality, Health, Safety, Social a nd Environmental management with almost 180 years of 
history in providing independent assurance services, and an annual 2013 revenue of 3.9 Billion Euros.  
No member of the verification team has a business relationship with Amgen, its Directors or Managers 
beyond that required of th is assignment.  We have conducted th is verification independently, and there 
has been no conflict of interest.  BVNA has implemented a Code of Ethics across the business to maintain high ethical standards among
