Caterpillar provides the talent, technology and 
solutions that protect our natural resources, 
support thriving communities and help build  
a world in which all people’s basic needs are 
met in sustainable ways. That’s our vision of  
a better world.
01
CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTCaterpillar had an outstanding year in 2017 , with achievements in 
many areas. Our ever-stronger sustainability record and our contribu-
tions to the circular economy were among our most important 
achievements this year. 
As a leading global manufacturer of heavy equipment, we provide 
the solutions – the engines, locomotives, machines and services – 
our customers use to build a better world. 
For more than 90 years, our customers have been using Caterpillar 
equipment to help improve living standards across the globe. Their 
work moves us closer to our vision of being a company that improves 
the communities where we live and work, and improves environmental 
quality. It also moves us closer to a world in which all people’s basic 
needs – such as shelter, clean water, sanitation, food and reliable 
power – are fulfilled in a sustainable way. 
With this vision in mind, we help enable economic growth and provide 
solutions that support communities and protect the planet. Global 
economic growth helps put people on a path to prosperity and is 
important to Caterpillar’s future. 
We provide work environments, products, services and solutions 
that make safe, productive and efficient use of resources. We know 
sustainable progress is possible through better systems that maxi-
mize life cycle benefits, systems that also minimize economic, social 
and environmental costs of ownership. Our operations are guided 
by our sustainability principles of preventing waste, improving quality 
and pursuing innovation to develop better systems. 
In 2017 , we also developed and began implementing a new enterprise 
strategy; the primary goal of the strategy is long-term profitable 
growth. Our Values in Action – Integrity, Excellence, Teamwork, 
Commitment, and Sustainability – are the foundation of that strategy 
and all we do.

CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTSUSTAINABILITY AT CATERPILLARWe have long been a company based on values. And, for 
more than thirty years, we have dedicated resources to 
remanufacturing and rebuilding products and compo-
nents that meet multiple sustainability goals. Just as 
importantly, remanufacturing and rebuilding deliver eco-
nomic value to our customers, by extending product life 
cycles and through more efficient use of resources. We 
are dedicated to remanufacturing and rebuilding oppor -
tunities across our company – from components to 
engines to turbines to rail. 
In addition to extending product life, we look at the 
totality of our processes to manufacture our products as 
responsibly as possible. Our facilities focus on energy 
and water conservation, and reducing waste and green-
house gas emissions to minimize environmental impacts. 
In many cases, the ingenuity of our employees brings 
some of the most innovative solutions, like the Focus 
Forward program in Athens, Georgia and the Zero-
Incident Performance (ZIP™) Process developed by 
Caterpillar Safety Services.
We constantly look for ways to work smarter on the job, 
to reduce waste and conserve natural resources. This  
is also part of our commitment to our customers who 
want to improve their operations and competitiveness 
and realize the full value of their assets on job sites. Caterpillar invests in innovation that both improves  
business opportunities and contributes to our sustainabil-
ity goals. We have examples of this in high-efficiency 
energy conversion and electrification, the expanding use 
of alternative fuels, and the use of distributed power gen-
eration systems that help improve energy access while 
emitting fewer greenhouse gas emissions. We have the 
world’s largest single autonomous fleet, which is moving 
hundreds of millions of tons of material for our mining 
customers, improving productivity, efficiency and safety. 
We value diversity and inclusion, and welcome the 
diverse contributions every individual can make to our 
company. We are committed to fostering an environment 
where all employees know that their unique skills, abili-
ties, experience and cultural background are respected. 
We are also committed to investing time and resources 
in the communities where we work and live. Since 
1952, the Caterpillar Foundation has been investing to 
transform lives across the globe through programs that 
support education, the environment and basic human 
needs. The Foundation is investing strategically, and in 
collaboration with partners, toward its goal of helping  
50 million people rise out of poverty by 2020. 
Collaboration is a watch-word for Caterpillar Foundation 
investments and our sustainability efforts worldwide. 
We know collaboration among our employees and with 
our customers, suppliers and dealers is necessary to 
achieve our vision of improved environmental quality 
and stronger communities around the world. We know 
working together we can make greater progress 
towards our sustainability goals and greater strides 
toward building a better world.

HELPS OUR CUSTOMERS 
BUILD A BETTER WORLD
A better world is within our reach. Caterpillar’s new enterprise strategy  
allows us to grow profitably so we can continue to innovate solutions that help 
customers build critical infrastructure and meet people’s basic needs. Though 
our strategy evolves with a changing marketplace, sustainability remains one  
of our foundational values, defining not only what we do, but how we do it. 
05
CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTCaterpillar aims to help customers use less 
fuel and generate fewer greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. These customer needs 
provide business opportunities for Caterpillar. 
We continue to develop products with  
fewer direct emissions. In addition, we’re 
increasing our investment in high-efficiency 
energy conversion and electrification – 
working to increase power density, expand 
the use of alternative fuels, maximize 
efficiency of power systems, and introduce 
electrification into our product lines while 
significantly decreasing owning and 
operating costs. In doing so, we help our 
customers improve their own operations, 
while also driving our industry to improve. 
A significant part of our business is committed 
to the supply of energy through efficient 
power-generation solutions. With distributed 
generation solutions using diesel and natural gas engines, as well as alternative fuels, we 
help get power where our customers need 
it. Caterpillar has implemented hundreds of 
distributed power generation systems all 
over the world, which contribute to improving 
energy access while emitting fewer GHG 
emissions compared with traditional power 
grid systems. We provide combined heat 
and power systems and combined-cycle 
power systems that can double the efficiency 
of power generation when compared with 
the efficiency of conventional power grids. 
In addition, our power systems use 
fuels from diverse sources such  
as gas from landfills, livestock 
operations, wastewater treatment 
operations, mine methane, flare 
gas, syngas and biofuels. These 
systems provide energy diversity 
from plentiful (and in many cases, 
renewable) energy sources.INNOVATING EFFICIENT

CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTINNOVATIONAutonomous Fleets in Action
Nowhere is Caterpillar’s autonomous technology making a bigger impact than at mine sites in Western  
Australia. In addition to safety benefits, the autonomous fleets have enabled significant cost and productivity 
improvements. Located in the Pilbara region, Fortescue Metals Group’s Solomon mine, with 60 autonomous 
trucks connected across more than 100 square miles, has seen productivity gains of up to 30 percent. 
07
CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTCaterpillar strives to provide customers with 
quality equipment that delivers the best 
economic proposition for their business. We 
remanufacture (reman) and rebuild products 
and components that provide customers not 
only with immediate cost savings, but also 
help extend life cycles and use materials 
more efficiently. Rebuild programs increase 
the lifespan of equipment by providing 
customers with a restored product for less 
cost than buying new. 
A complete Cat® Certified Rebuild includes 
more than 350 tests and inspections, 
automatic replacement of approximately 
7,000 parts and a like-new machine warranty. 
In addition, trained dealer service professionals 
perform this work using genuine equipment 
and parts. Caterpillar provides information, data, training and service tools to help dealers 
make the most appropriate decisions on 
which parts to reuse in order to achieve 
expected longevity of rebuilt components. 
Reuse of components helps us use materials 
and energy more efficiently. 
Caterpillar takes a systems view of the life of 
our products. We design and manufacture 
them for multiple lives, our dealers support 
and service them to maximize their value to 
the customer, and we remanufacture them 
at the end of their useful life to deliver the 
next generation of value. Our engineering and 
manufacturing expertise, field population and 
dealer organization make this possible. This 
total life cycle approach allows us to provide 
sustainable solutions that help customers 
build a better world.EXTENDING

CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTREMANUFACTURINGA More Efficient Assembly Process 
Through a collaborative effort involving team members from manufacturing, salvage, marketing and engineering,  
Caterpillar has developed a new engine prechamber assembly for the Cat® 3600 engine. The assembly uses 
state-of-the-art machining and laser weld technology. The process reuses over 25 tons of metal annually, reducing 
new raw material used and providing customers with savings in owning and operating costs.
09
CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTReducing waste and conserving natural 
resources on job sites are increasingly 
important goals of many of Caterpillar’s 
customers as they seek to realize the full 
value of their assets on the job site. Our Job 
Site Solutions team works in partnership with 
Cat® dealers to help customers find innovative 
ways to improve their operations and be more 
competitive in the marketplace – solutions that often deliver additional sustainability 
benefits. For instance, optimizing fleet 
efficiency not only reduces costs, but  
can also improve the maintenance and 
component replacement cycles of individual 
machines. Better maintenance execution can 
extend the life of a machine, which in turn 
reduces raw material consumption.WORKING SMARTER

CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTWe are dedicated to the safety of everyone 
at Caterpillar, including that of the extended 
team of contractors, dealers, suppliers and 
customers. Our commitment to safety begins 
with the engineering of our products and 
manufacturing processes, and extends to 
operator training, job site solutions and 
promoting a culture of safety that guides 
the way we work.
In Caterpillar facilities, our Environment, 
Health & Safety (EHS) Assurance Manual 
establishes fundamental EHS requirements 
that apply globally, and Caterpillar’s safety 
and health risk assessment process  
brings a global focus to the identification, 
measurement and reduction of safety and 
ergonomic risk. In addition to these global 
expectations, our facilities implement  innovative, local initiatives to positively 
impact our safety results. Caterpillar’s EHS 
professionals play a key role in providing 
expertise and support to Caterpillar 
operations around the world.
Caterpillar Safety Services has helped 
promote a culture of safety in our customer 
organizations through the Caterpillar Zero-
Incident Performance (ZIP™) Process. Our 
global EHS team leads the deployment of 
the process in our own facilities. The ZIP 
Process guides organizations in achieving the 
engagement and accountability required for 
world-class safety performance. The ZIP 
Process combines leadership buy-in, 
accountability, continuous improvement  
and evaluation to transform culture. ENABLING

CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTSAFETYA Forward-Focused Approach to Safety
Our facility in Athens, Georgia, developed a predictive safety model called Focus Forward that uses a scorecard  
to provide visibility into safety performance. Scorecards track incidents by value stream, shift, day of the week, time  
of day and other factors. In the event of an incident, managers may use “plays” on the back of a Focus Forward card  
to walk through proven courses of action and steer their teams back to safety.
13
CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTAt our facilities, we work to minimize our  
environmental impact by focusing on energy 
conservation, GHG emission reduction, water 
conservation and waste reduction. We have 
set energy-efficiency targets in our operations 
since 1998 and have set GHG emission-
reduction targets since 2003. We currently 
have operational targets for an increased 
reliance on alternative and renewable energy 
and a reduction in energy intensity and GHG 
emissions intensity. 
As a manufacturer of heavy equipment, 
some of Caterpillar’s operations are energy-
intensive. But even in our most energy-dense 
environments, Caterpillar employees have 
found ways to implement innovative energy 
solutions that reduce our energy costs as 
well as our environmental impacts.With respect to water, we recognize  
the far-reaching economic, social and 
environmental implications that water 
scarcity may have in the future, and have 
taken steps to reduce our consumption. 
Finally, we are minimizing waste in our  
processes not only to reduce costs, but also 
to reduce our use of materials, energy, water 
and land. We ultimately aim to reduce all 
waste generated by our production processes. 
By taking a critical look at every phase of our 
operations, teams have been able to uncover 
unexpected methods to reduce our footprint 
while maintaining or improving performance 
and customer satisfaction. MANUFACTURING

CATERPILLAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTMANUFACTURINGA Space-Age Solution  
for Acid Etching 
Our Advanced Materials Technology team 
borrowed a technique from the aerospace 
industry to perform acid etch checks without 
methanol, improving the safety of the  
process while reducing hazardous waste  
and hazardous air pollutants. A new facility  
in Cienega de Flores, Mexico, was able to 
replicate the technique and was designed  
to use this process from the start. Bright Ideas for 
Energy Savings 
The Material Handling & Underground 
Division at our Thiruvallur, India, facility 
leveraged its location’s average of 
2,700 hours of sun per year by installing 
a 285 kW Cat® microgrid – helping 
reduce GHG emissions 32 percent  
in two years.Making Better Use  
of Process Water 
Our Seguin Engine Center in Texas 
manufactures, tests and paints diesel 
engines for Caterpillar customers, a 
process that requires large volumes  
of water. A micro-filtration system 
allows us to reuse water, reducing 
wastewater from the engine testing 
process by 90 percent. Yellow Paint With  
Less Water 
Painting processes typically require a significant 
amount of highly treated process water. In our 
Xuzhou, China, facility, we were obtaining water 
from the city and treating it for use in the paint 
line. Now, we are collecting condensate water 
for reuse, reducing the fresh water needed for 
the paint line. Implemented in November 2016, 
this process is saving about 40,000 gallons of 
water per year. 
15

 1   This represents employee and retiree donations made in the calendar year 2016, and the Caterpillar Foundation’s match made in the calendar year 2017 .
 2 This includes employee and retiree contributions, and the Foundation match, for campaigns in the United States, Mexico and Panama.
 3 Information regarding reporting boundaries and data assurance are provided here.
 4  Caterpillar provides guidance that actual hours worked be used wherever possible. Where necessary, Management and Salaried employee hours should 
be estimated as 9 hours per day (may use another value with appropriate documentation). In some cases, vacation hours have not been subtracted 
from Management and Salaried employee estimates of hours worked.
 5 Data prior to 2017 has been restated due to data updates realized from improved accuracy.
 6  Total includes purchased and on-site generated alternative and renewable energy, as well as calculating the percentage of renewable energy from 
grid-purchased electricity using data obtained from the International Energy Agency.
 7  Renewable Energy: Caterpillar defines renewable energy as energy resources that are naturally replenishing over a short period of time and virtually 
inexhaustible. Power generation examples include wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, tidal, wave, biomass and biogas from anaerobic digestion.
 8  Alternative Energy: Caterpillar defines alternative energy as any source of usable energy that offers substantial environmental benefits compared to 
the conventional sources of energy that it replaces. Power generation examples include landfill gas, coal mine and abandoned mine methane, combined 
heat and power (cogen, trigen and quadgen), coal with carbon sequestration and localized power generation. Transportation fuel examples include pure 
methanol, ethanol blends of 85 percent or more with gasoline, pure natural gas, natural gas blends of 85 percent or more with diesel fuel, liquid fuels 
domestically produced from natural gas (compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas and gas to liquid fuels), propane, coal-derived liquid fuels, 
hydrogen and electricity.
 9  GHG emissions intensity reduction goal is based on our combined Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect, market-based) GHG emissions using a  
2006 baseline year. Likewise, total absolute GHG emissions are a sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions.
 10  Location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions are provided in accordance with the GHG Protocol updated Scope 2 guidance. In 2015, the GHG Protocol provided 
updated Scope 2 calculation guidance. Our market-based Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the updated Scope 2 Quality Criteria. The following 
instruments were used in calculating our market-based Scope 2 emissions: Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, energy contracts, supplier specific 
emission rates, Caterpillar owned combined heat and power cogeneration facilities, and, for the remainder of our facilities, grid average emission factors 
from USEPA’s eGRID and the International Energy Agency’s data. For 2017 calculations, Caterpillar did not use residual mix factors.
 11 Water consumption intensity does not include non-contact cooling water.
 12  Data does not include Progress Rail or Solar Turbines. Product returned for remanufacture (called ‘core’) is not always returned within the same calendar 
year as sold.
 13  This includes remanufacturing, component overhauls at Cat® dealers, power generation using alternative energy sources, customer job site optimization 
and innovative new products. The components are evaluated each year to adjust for acquisitions, divestitures, offerings that become standard and 
improvements to data accuracy.
