The Sustainability Report of the Telecom Italia Group has been prepared voluntarily by Telecom Italia SpA based on
data drawn from internal sources (draft annual report, consolidated Group report, proprietary reports and otherCompany documents), applying the indicators and standards quoted in the text. The document has been preparedsolely for information.The Sustainability Report has been verified by the auditing company, Reconta Ernst & Young S.p.A., for an opinion onconformity.Growth in the world economy,
globalization, the new information andcommunication technologies andliberalization of monopolized productionindustries have reasserted market focus asthe driving force for development and havesparked  the demand for socially responsiblebusinesses, capable of fostering aneconomic trend, in which equality, balanceand respect for the environment figuremore highly.
Business management policies and
strategies currently reflect two conflictingmodels.One sees social responsibility extending nofurther than its talent to generate profit,with focus primarily on shareholders andfinanciers. Business performance isaccordingly measured based on ability tocreate value.The other defines social responsibility inbroader terms, endeavouring to achieve anetwork of relationships that connect thebusiness to a variety of stakeholders.Investment in human capital and researchand development are considered strategicfor policies to improve the quality ofproducts, in order to increase businesscompetitivity.Along with many other global
corporations, the principal voluntaryorganizations and the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions, theTelecom Italia Group has supported the
nine principles set by the Global Compactproposed by the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, regarding humanrights, labor standards andenvironmental protection. 
The Telecom Italia Group has always
invested in social and environmentalvalues; for five years it has published arigorous, in-depth report, refininginformation contained in it and selectingfrom it the most reliable indicators tosupplement its annual report. 
It stands alongside other big businesses in
Italy and Europe which have alreadyadopted this best practice and serves asan example for others wishing toprofitably embark on this course. 
As a leading industry it proposes
sustainability as a business value, a toolfor programming, management andcontrol.

G8
Meetings of the heads of state and
government leaders of the majorindustrialized countries (G8) haveprogressively involved the leaders ofcorporations and internationalnongovernmental organizations in taskforces and foundations that proposestrategies to solve global issues. Among thevarious initiatives, the following are ofparticular importance:-the Digital Opportunity Task Force, which
has the objective of reducing the digitaldivide, or rather the great disparitiesbetween industrial and developingcountries in access to information andcommunication technologies;
-the Renewable Energy Task Force, which
promotes diffusion of forms of renewableenergy;
-the Global Health Fund, which will have
the task of mobilizing financial andorganizational resources, alongside thegovernments of the major countries, theprincipal pharmaceutical industries,corporations in other sectors andcharities, to supply drugs and vaccines topoor countries, helping them fightmalaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. 
UN
Recognizing this evolution in progress, the
United Nations Environment Program(UNEP) introduced the concept ofsustainability for the first time in the 2001edition of its international benchmarksurvey of corporate reporting. In addition tothe traditional indicators of environmentalperformance, the economic and socialperformance of the firms analyzed was
also taken into consideration. Economic performance is not assessed onthe basis of created value and return oninvested capital alone, but based on moredirect contributions to sustainabledevelopment, such as commitment toemployment, to education and learning,to development of local communities, andto implementation of  developmentpolicies.
In Europe
At the Lisbon summit in spring 2000 the
heads of State and government leaders ofthe European Union countries made anappeal to companies to support equalopportunities and sustainabledevelopment. In July 2001, the European Commissionpublished a Green Paper promoting aEuropean framework for Corporate SocialResponsibility.The European Union has put CorporateSocial Responsibility in the Europeanpolitical agenda and at the Conference inBrussels (November 2001) it promotedconcrete initiatives aimed also atimproving consumer information,evaluating social and environmentalperformance,  promoting sociallyresponsible practices in small and mediumsized enterprises, broadening social dialogand integrating social and ethicalrequirements in public calls for bids, anddeveloping pension funds.

increasing pressure from civil society,expecting companies to give account fortheir actions, judging not only the effects ofthese actions but also their intentions.
Triple bottom line
In pioneering companies the new forms of
social reporting are being integrated andcombined with the more traditionalinstruments to produce the dual bottomline, which combines the environmentalreport and social report; this has preparedthe way for the triple bottom line (TBL),which integrates both the preceding reportswith the financial report thus forming asingle document covering all aspects ofcorporate performance.Economic, environmental and socialperformance appear to be closely related inan increasing number of cases. As SimonZadek, who conceived AccountAbility 1000 -a scheme of process indicators for socialreporting activities - reveals in The CivilCorporation (London 2002), sustainabledevelopment does not merely express themodern vision of a healthy environmentand a socially just society, it also providesthe strategic and practical frameworkfundamental for future successfulenterprises.
Social reporting is increasingly based on
shared process standards, such as the qualityprinciples proposed by AccountAbility 1000(inclusiveness, completeness, comparability,meaningfulness of information, regularity,communication, external auditing,integration in management systems, andcontinuous improvement), with minimumcore content regarding corporate identity,corporate governance mechanisms,calculation of value added distribution andthe social report.Stakeholders
The Sustainability Report is therefore
drawn up considering the followingcategories of stakeholders:
• 
consumers , whose needs are met by
the company realizing value addedthrough production of goods andservices;
• 
suppliers , who provide the raw
materials, and intermediate goods andservices needed for production, socontributing to the quality of the finalproduct;
• 
competitors , who stimulate the
company to improve productivity andefficiency;
• the 
State , which receives resources in
the form of taxes, social security andnational insurance contributions, thetelecommunications license fee anddividends;
• 
future generations , analyzed through
data on the environment and civilprotection, whose capacity to satisfytheir own needs must not bejeopardized by pursuit of present dayobjectives;
• the 
Community , or civil society to
which the company contributesthrough socially relevant activities inthe fields of research and innovation,education, health and social solidarity,culture, art and sport;
• 
employees ;
• shareholders .

Evalutation
Telecom Italia SpA’s suppliers are qualified and submitted to incoming quality inspections
before being classified by means of an internal vendor rating process.The qualification process comprises an evaluation of suppliers based on the criteria ofeconomic-financial soundness, technical potential and the supplier’s own quality controlsystem. Roll membership, certification by “Società Organismo di Attestazione” (certificationagency), and ISO certifications are also checked.Incoming quality control, which is conducted on product categories at risk, allows the qualitystandards of products and services to be checked against the technical and environmentalrequirements specified by contract during the supply or delivery phase, and follow-up withcorrective action and technical inspections.The vendor rating is used to assess the overall standards of quality achieved by suppliers infulfillment of contract regarding specific section performance and quality standards.
In 2001, several environment-related innovations were introduced into the qualification
processes; specifically, qualification systems were defined for:•Suppliers of lead-acid storage batteries: check that they have waste treatment plants (air
filtering, water purification, etc);1preliminary information

The OLO (Other Licensed Operators) and ISP (Internet Service Providers) are at the same
time:- 
Competitors and participate in defining the rules for fair competition. Creation of
balanced, stable, predictable rules is a common objective in the interests of all businessesin the sector. Progress in the competitive situation in Italy, judged to be among the mostadvanced in continental Europe, is highlighted in the last “implementation report”recently published by the European Commission.
- 
Partners in development of new services and new business models. In the recent past,
development first in mobile telephony followed by Internet was also thanks toinnovations proposed by different businesses. The more successful models, from prepaidcards to free Internet, spread rapidly to the benefit of all players in the market.
- 
Customers of Telecom Italia. With the new organization introduced in the second
semester of 2001 a special Wholesale Division was created to sell a wide range of services.Telecom Italia is one of the first operators in Europe to have offered services such as the
“permanent virtual channel”, “partial circuits”, “wholesale direct circuits”, and “sharedaccess”. Supply times and the quality of service guaranteed to customer-competitors arethe same as offered to the internal sales divisions. With the leveling of all Internet ServiceProviders the legislative conditions have been created to guarantee equal treatment to alloperators using the services offered by Telecom Italia.
Litigation
A number of litigation cases currently involve competitors in connection with:
- the Universal service for 1999
- the x-DSL Technology Data Transmission and Internet Access service- failure to renew the agreement with the Internet Provider Galactica- alleged anti-competitive strategies

/L50123Electromagnetic emissions
Technological development in the telecommunications field now makes it possible to
communicate and transmit or receive increasingly more complex information withoutrequiring physical connections, thanks to sophisticated systems that use radio waves. Thesewaves, which are of the same nature as light, consist of electromagnetic fields whichpropagate through space and belong to a radiation range termed non-ionizing, that is notcapable of causing functional or morphological changes in biological systems.The effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields have been under study for years; currentscientific knowledge, confirmed by the World Health Organization, makes it possible toconsider it unlikely that exposure to the electromagnetic field levels generated bytelecommunications transmission systems can lead to pathologies which may even beserious.At the same time the World Health Organization stresses that it is important to continuestudying the phenomenon in order to achieve an increasingly in-depth understanding of it,a statement that is fully supported by the Telecom Italia Group, which closely followsdevelopments in related scientific studies in order to guarantee maximum safety inoperation of its installations and use of the services it offers the public.1preliminary information

Netsiel, Telesoft,Saritel, TILAB,Emsa, Seat,Matrix, Buffetti,Sodalia, Immsi.sustainability report 2001 22The Telecom Italia Group’s attention to the issue of electromagnetic emissions can be
summed up in the following commitments and actions:- absolute compliance with the legislation in force in the countries in which it operates.
Italian law on the subject is particularly strict. The Company process is structured onrigorous management of project engineering, of the selection of sites, and of installationof systems. In particular, every transmission antenna is protected to create a restricted-access area where permitted exposure values (regulatory volume) could be exceeded.
- careful and scrupulous management of Company installations throughout the whole life
cycle, in compliance with additional internal efficiency and safety standards;
- use of, and constant research for, leading-edge technology tools for control and
investigation activities. In particular, close predictions of the electromagnetic fieldsgenerated on the surrounding environment are made for mobile telephony installationsby advanced simulation programs with the objective of checking constant compliance withlegal limits;
- cooperation and support in medical-scientific studies. Specifically, Telecom Italia SpA, in
cooperation with a number of Italian universities and national and internationalorganizations, promoted investigations to check the emission values of electromagneticradiations and their possible effects. These investigations confirmed that the values of theelectromagnetic fields generated by the equipment managed by the Telecom Italia Groupin Italy are within the regulatory limits and that, according to current knowledge, thereare no associated risks at biological level. In addition, in relation to the electromagneticemissions issue, TIM SpA gave support to ANPA “Agenzia Nazionale per la Protezionedell’Ambiente” (National Environmental Protection Agency) for defining, on a statisticalbasis, propagation models for the creation of an electromagnetic emissions data bank inItaly.
/L50123ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
Environmental research within the companies in the Group operating in Italy is principally
conducted by TILAB SpA (a wholly owned subsidiary of Telecom Italia SpA).
In 2001, it tackled and conducted the following for:
/L50123Telecom Italia SpA:
•activities related to checking electromagnetic emissions on critical sites and measurement
of toxic gases in work environments;
•methodologies for collection and analysis of microbiological contaminants in indoor air
(office environment);
•investigations on eco-compatible materials to substitute the substances traditionally used
to impregnate wooden telegraph/telephone poles, including revision of the relatedspecifications, and evaluation of issues regarding poles made of glass reinforced plastic;
•methodologies and instruments to monitor and optimize energy consumption relating to
the power supply and air-conditioning of network equipment.

The Environmental Management System is the most effective tool for rational management
of the Company’s environmental impacts.
/L50123Telecom Italia SpA
The Network function of the business unit Domestic Wireline started work (in January 2001)
on preparation of its Environmental Management System, in accordance with theinternational standard UNI EN ISO 14001. Six Project Groups were formed with the task ofdeveloping the various requirements for the System, which will be integrated into theQuality Management System; certification is scheduled for September 2003.
/L50123TILAB obtained the certification (in March 2001) of its Environmental Management System,
developed in accordance with the international standard UNI EN ISO 14001 by DNV (DetNorske Veritas - internationally accredited certification body established in 1864). TILAB’sManagement System integrates environment and health & safety issues, health & safetybeing managed in accordance with standard OHSAS 18001.
/L50123TIM SpA
The Network function implemented an integrated Quality and Environment Management
System for the North-West Network. It is directed towards achieving ISO 9001 certificationfor Quality and ISO 14001 for the Environment and will later be extended to the otherareas. Progress at year-end was 80%.
A number of phenomena peculiar to 
Telecom Italia SpA’s business are analyzed herebelow
in relation to environmental impact.
/L50123Pinewood telephone poles
Supply of new poles and management of obsolete poles are integrated in a single process.
This includes various forms of recovery and disposal of obsolete poles.In 2001, approximately 120,000 pinewood poles were purchased, 86% of which were“ecological” type (treated with low environmental impact organic salts to protect themfrom atmospheric agents and especially from fungi, insects and moulds).
Approximately 63,000 poles, weighing 5,355 tonnes, were removed and recovered or
disposed of (about 45% less than in 2000). 86% of these were put up for sale in accordancewith statutory procedures, approximately 5% were recycled after impregnation removalprocesses, and approximately 8% were salvaged for re-use in telecommunications aeriallines. Less than 1% went to landfill.
/L50123Generator units
As a result of the program to switch off 27 kVA generator units, launched by the Network
function, 269 units, equivalent to 86% of the total number of installed units, were taken outof service. The measure led to a saving of 13,000 liters of diesel oil.
/L50123Acoustic Emission Monitoring
Monitoring of the acoustic emissions from installations on 994 sites selected from the most
important and potentially exposed to the risk of noise pollution continued in the Networkfunction. 17% of monitored sites were found non-compliant; remedial action is in progress.
/L50123Modification and Upgrading
In 2001, approximately Euro 6,609 million were spent under the “Program for conversion,
modification and upgrading of power plants and air-conditioning systems” in accordancewith statutory provisions, while approximately Euro 10,349 million were spent in extension1preliminary information

/L50123Procurement processes
Implementation of procurement policies directed towards increased efficiency for improved
environmental performance continued.In this approach, pursuit of objective-based partnerships with suppliers and categorizationtaking into consideration the whole life cycle of a product, make it possible to minimize theenvironmental impacts of products introduced into the Company and the productmanagement procedures, optimizing waste management at end of life and possibilities ofreuse and recycle.
In addition to confirming the processes for ecological supply and management of pinewood
telegraph/telephone poles, another two typologies of full-cycle agreement were defined. Inthese agreements, the principal offering, supply of goods or services, is linked with anattached service concerning recovery and disposal of discarded products. The first typologyreviewed was the one concerning management of scrap cable left over and/or recoveredfrom telecommunications network development and maintenance operations. The referenceprocedure was modified outsourcing management of scrap cable to the NetworkCompanies. The other typology concerned the supply, assistance and maintenance of sometypes of access systems, to which the principle of buy-back of old products present in thenetwork and the related condition of correct environmental management was applied. Suchan initiative succeeds in reducing the number of parties involved in the process as well as inmotivating a reduction in waste through studying forms of reuse and/or effectiverefinements.
/L50123EHS data record
Full application of the EHS Data Record Management Procedure was confirmed. It was
improved with more straightforward and effective procedures, in line with the Company’scurrent requirements in the environment, health and safety area.
Concerning products and materials acquired on the basis of specifications drawn up by the
technical functions, consistent with the role of procurement, the objectives are finalized toensure that the products and materials introduced into the Company are designed,manufactured and delivered in an environmentally responsible manner and that they haverecognizable and recognized technical-environmental requirements.

/L50123CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO THE LONDON BENCHMARKING
GROUP MODEL
The London Benchmarking Group (LBG), established in 1994, comprises 60 large
international companies and is currently the European benchmark in evolution of social-environmental reporting.
This model reclassifies contributions into four different categories. The pyramid diagram
reflects the possibility of measuring the benefits and business returns arising from thevarious activities. The return can easily be measured at the base of the pyramid since it isconnected to the core business. At the apex, donations are strictly linked to the Group’ssense of social and moral responsibility.
The four-category classification proposed by the LBG model is not straightforward as a single
initiative may have effects in more than one different category. As a general rule, preferencehas been given to comparability with previous years.
Classification according to this model compared with 2000, shows a 12% increase in the
share for innovative services, while the share spent in investments in the social fielddecreases by the same percentage. The percentage contributed to charity, however, isunchanged.1preliminary information

37 selected financial datasustainability report 2001 36“While all firms are driven by the profit motive to increase productivity and maintain a
competitive edge in their chosen markets such a goal should be pursued in a way that issocially responsible and ecologically compatible”
(from the letter of introduction to the 2001 Report)
The Telecom Italia Group has introduced new Corporate Governance processes which
provide for:•simplification of the corporate organization;
•establishment of management committees for investments and international operations;
•introduction of the “professional families” system to improve management efficiency and
control;
•new investments and procurement procedures;
•rationalization of the Regional Service Centers.
The objective is creation of value, leveraging on infrastructures, available technologies and
characteristic competences with substantial investment in applied research into process andproduct innovation.
The intention is to make Italy play a leading role in high technology and patents, actively
contributing to building the “Country System”, investing in e-government and, certainly,turning invested capital into profit.
Focus on consumers will lead to changing the internal organization in the business units,
making it more customer oriented than product oriented.
Human resources are a strategic resource for attainment of the objectives. They will be
involved in the corporate changes by intensifying two-way communication.
(from presentation of the Industrial Plan to the Financial Community - 02/14/2002)
Determination to adhere to the principles of sustainability stated in the Charter of Values,
Charter of Services and Environmental Charter is reflected in the projects under definitionand/or implementation concerning a number of instruments considered indispensable:•planning of environmental actions consistent with the global strategy, such as
conservation of energy and natural resources, supporting recycle and renewable sources;
•development of a common environmental conscience in suppliers and customers;
•the Environmental Management System;
•Life Cycle Assessment studies;
•the Group Code of Practice;
•voluntary agreements with the Public Administration.
Some Group Companies are already equipped to move towards sustainability; the
commitment is aimed at introducing these instruments throughout the Group at a gradualpace suited to its dimensions and range of interests.1preliminary information
