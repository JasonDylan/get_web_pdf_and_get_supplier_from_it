III With its networks, products and technological solutions, TIM plays a leading role in the evolution towards a digital economy 
and, given its size, infrastructure and technological assets, as well as its territorial presence, is integrated into the ope rational 
area and the social, economic and production context. TIM is aware of this strategic role and therefore  works constantly to 
manage and innovate its infrastructure and technologies, which it places at the service of the nationand to which end it makes 
significant investments.  
The ambitious investment plan contained in the Group Strategic Plan for the three -year period 2018- 2020 sets important 
coverage targets for broadband and ultrabroadband technologies. We are committed to achieving the challenging obj ectives 
set forth by the European Union by creating a Digital Single Market, in terms of both fixed and mobile ultrabroadband coverag e 
and the increasing demand for digital services. TIM's investment plan therefore plays a significant role in the digital 
transformation of society as a whole, and confirms our Group’s historic role as an engine for the modernisation of Italy.
A focus on innovation and investments in new infrastructure and technologies also characterise TIM's action in Brazil, a country 
which the Group has operated in since 1997 via its subsidiary TIM Brasil, and which is the Group's second largest market. In the 
last 5 years alone, TIM has invested more than 7 billion euros in Brazil, focusing primarily on building new generation infrastructur e. 
The contribution our Group makes to the development of society doesn't stop at infrastructure projects, but ranges from 
digital 
solutions for public administration to cloud services for businesses, digital platforms for schools and hospitals and applica tions 
for people with disabilities to technologies for reducing energy use by companies and cities.  
While our infrastructure and services act as a driving force for the development of society, our commitment to pursuing the 
sustainable development of the company is manifested first and foremost in the ethical conduct of all daily activities. We 
strongly believe that there can be no sustainable development for our Group or for society without strong foundations in ethi cal 
principles and actions. For us, ethical action translates into a strong sense of responsibility towards stakeholders: this is the clear 
message that comes across in our Code of Ethics and in the Human Rights Policy, with a steadfast commitment to the principles of the UN Global Compact and other major standards for the full respect of labour rights, environmental protection and the fight against corruption.  
In terms of environmental protection, our Group contributes to 
the reduction of customers’ energy consumption and emissions 
with virtualisation solutions and remote monitoring of consumption and travel. Meanwhile, we  continue to be conscientious with regard to the environmental footprint of our activities. We have embarked on a series of projects for replacing energy -
intensive equipment an d systems, and we have set ourselves short, medium and long -term objectives for reducing our CO
2 
emissions and electricity consumption. These goals are even more challenging considering that the development of next generation networks requires greater amounts of energy and that, therefore, any reduction in energetic consumption can only happen as a result of the careful management of energy resources.  
Letter from the Chairman  
“A prerequisite for the greater economic wellbeing of current and future generations is the ever-
increasing dissemination of digital technologies to meet the needs of people  in their work and 
personal lives, to support corporate development and innovation, to improve the efficiency and 
quality of public services and, last but not least, to ensure greater respect for the environment 
and a more effective fight against climate change.”  !

IV 
On the social side, in addition to contributing to improving people’s  quality of life through digitisation,  we pay  attention to 
caring for and motivating the Group’s people . 2017 was characterized by significant action to wards safeguarding employment 
and retraining employees, which is considered a priority; a series of actions were taken in this respect, starting with the 
introduction of structured training courses for the development of professional skills, which allowed the sectors with the 
greatest impact on the business to be strengthened and the internal market of the Group's professional skills to be enhanced.  
The last few years have been very demanding and many new challenges will be faced in the years ahead.  With the 
development of the Digital Internal Market, Europe will undoubtedly play a leading role in the “Gigabit Societ y” of the future. We
are convinced of our role as a fundamental tool for giving institutions and citizens an awareness that these challenges can be 
overcome, through our contribution with our networks and our services.

6 NOTE ON METHODOLOGY  [GRI 102 -56]
Scope and criteria  
The Consolidated Non -Financial Statement (hereinafter “Statement” or “Sustainability Report”) complies with the obligations 
laid down in  Italian  Legislative Decree 254/2016 on the disclosure of non- financial information. For TIM, this Statement, which 
coincides with the Sustainability Report, represents the result of the commitment to notify its stakeholders of the performances 
and results achieve d in the sustainability area, already undertaken in previous years.  [GRI 102 -45] The Statement contains data 
and information referring to the Company TIM S.p.A. and its fully consolidated subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017 (hereinaft er 
“the TIM Group” or “the Group”), as presented in the Annual Financial Report. The environmental performance data is detailed 
with some limitations with respect to the Group scope. These limitations are not important to understand the Company’s 
activities, performance, result s or the impact produced by the Group.   
[GRI 102 -50] [GRI 102 -51] [GRI 102 -52] The 2017 Sustainability Report, prepared annually over the calendar year, respects the 
same deadlines as the Group Annual Financial Report and meets the obligations envisaged b y Legislative Decree  254/2016. The 
Report is based on a multi -stakeholder approach involving the joint analysis of actions taken in respect of the main stakeholders 
with whom the Company interacts.  
[GRI 102 -10] [GRI 102- 48] No significant changes were recorded in the consolidation area in 2017. During the last three year 
period, the main changes include the creation of INWIT S.p.A., listed on the Milan stock exchange, operating in the electroni c 
communication infrastructures  sector.  
Data relating to previous years is provided for comparative purposes only, in order to allow an assessment of the dynamic tre nd 
of the Group’s activities over the medium term. Note that information relating to “Fondazione TIM” and “TIM Institute” , entities 
not included within the Group’s consolidation scope, represents a qualitative element which useful in order to understand the 
attention paid to the social context, even though this information is not part of the consolidation scope of the quanti tative 
information contained in the document.  
[GRI 102-5 4] This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Comprehensive option. Moreover it has been 
prepared abiding the process suggested by the principles of the AA1000APS (inclusiveness, materiality, responsiveness). 
References to the GRI indicators are given to provide a greater understanding and highlighted in the text with the symbol  
[GRI N.] . 
The Sustainability Report is drawn up according to a system of indicators (KPI - Key Perf ormance Indicators) which measure the 
company's performance and the degree of achievement of objectives previously established for areas in which the Company 
has major impact.  
The KPIs are defined on the basis of:  
• the analysis of the GRI, an international  organisation which develops universally applicable guidelines for the drafting
of sustainability reports;
• the demands received from stakeholders;
• the questionnaires sent out by the leading rating  agencies for the purpose of admission to the stock market
sustainability indexes;
• the experience the Company has gained in the sustainability field over more than 20 years.
The KPIs are managed on a dedicated application system (BPC) that uses the same platform used for financial reporting and controlling.  !

Principal economic, ﬁnancial and operational data  
The TIM Group aims to achieve a balance between the three dimens ions: 
•  environmental sustainability: maintaining the function of ecological systems, ensuring a balance between the use of natural 
resources and the company's activities;  
•  social sustainability: promoting the principle of fairness between generations and wit hin the same generation;  
•  economic sustainability: maintaining and increasing capital.  
 
[GRI 102 -7] The Group reports on what it does to achieve this objective in the Sustainability Report, which focuses primarily on 
environmental and social sustainability, as well as aspects that are both of a social and economic nature (e.g. customer care  
and innovation management) and the Annual Financial Report, which discusses the Group's economic performance in detail. In 
order to give a comprehensive view of the Group's sustainability, we have provided some summary data of economic performance below, which are dra wn from the Annual Report.

16 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE   
[GRI 102 -18] [GRI 102- 19] [GRI 102 -24] TIM S.p.A.'s governance system is structured in the conventional way and is in line 
with the Board of Directors of TIM S.p.A.. The Group's Board of Directors is appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting based on 
slates submitted by eligib le voters who own a total of at least 0.5% of the ordinary share capital (or any other amount that may 
be required by the regulations issued by Consob). [GRI 102 -22] [GRI 102 -24] The only stakeholders represented in the Board of 
Directors are the sharehold ers. Directors' powers are granted (and revoked) by the Board of Directors, which determines the 
purpose, limits and methods by which they are exercised.  
[GRI 102 -24] TIM's Bylaws require the least represented gender to account for at least one third of t he total number of 
directors, rounded up to the next unit in the event of a fraction. The independence of a minimum number of Directors is required by the law (CLFI)
1 based on the overall composition of the Board; the same law and the Corporate Governance Code of 
Borsa Italiana also define the criteria for the independence of directors.  
GRI [102 -24] In delivering its guidance to shareholders, with a view to the Shareholders' Meeting called to renew the Board of 
Directors on April 16, 2014, the outgoing Board of Directors expressed, among other things, a few wishes regarding the new Board, including:  
•  exercise, in a timely manner, their rights to submit slates of candidates for the office of Directors of the Company 
assigned to them by the law and the Company Bylaws;  
•  consider the suggestions and assessments given above regarding the composition of the slates of candidates;  
•  present, together with the slates, grounded proposals regarding the number, term of office and compensation of the Directors being appoint ed, being attentive to the recommendations made in the Report on the proposed resolutions of 
the Shareholders' Meeting of 4 May 2017, available via the website www.telecomitalia.com.  
[GRI 102 -22] The Board of Directors in office as of April 16, 2014 consis ts of 15 members, including 10 independents. 6 of the 
Board members are women and the female gender is the only social subgroup represented. The “Structure of the Board of 
Directors and of the Committees and other offices held” contained in the Report on C orporate Governance and Share 
Ownership for the 2017 financial year indicates, for each director, the date of first appointment, the term of office, the 
committees they are members of, the number and nature of other positions they hold, the slate they are listed on (indicating 
“LSGR” in the case of appointment with a slate vote and candidacy by the SGR and Institutional Investors' slate, indicating “ LV” 
in the case of appointment of candidates proposed by the Vivendi slate), any independence and executive/n on-executive status 
as well as their CV, also available on the telecomitalia.com2 website. The Directors' skills in the field of economics range from 
university teaching to graduate and post -graduate studies, specific training in the field of mergers and a cquisitions, and 
experience with stock market supervision authorities and at the top of big companies. More details are available via the 
telecomitalia.com website. [GRI 102 -31] 13 meetings of the Board of Directors were held in 2017.  
[GRI 102 -27] The Directors take part in specific meetings with the management or external consultants, aimed at providing 
adequate knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates, business dynamics and their evolution. Business lunches, 
workshops on new technologies and educational -informative meetings are held prior to strategic meetings. Updates regarding 
the relevant legislative framework are provided in specific briefing notes. Training sessions on sustainability are also planned for 
2018.

17 [GRI 102 -18] [GRI  102- 24] The committees currently set up within the Board of Directors are the Control and Risk Committee, 
the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Strategy Committee. Significant transactions with related parties are 
subject to scrutiny by the Co ntrol and Risk Committee, in the case of transactions of lesser importance, or by a Committee 
consisting of all the Independent Directors, in the case of transactions of greater importance. The process of selecting and appointing members of each Committee,  and the independence and competence requirements are described in the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee Regulations and in the Control and Risk Committee Regulations, both available on 
the telecomitalia.com website.  
[GRI 102 -28] For the 2017 financial  year, the self- assessment of the size, composition and operation of the Board and its 
Committees was carried out with the support of the consultant Eric Salmon. The board review is carried out every year (since 2005). The assessment methods and results ar e illustrated in the Report on Corporate Governance. The 2017 self -assessment 
did not tackle issues of sustainability.  
[GRI 102 -19] [GRI 102- 20] [GRI 102- 23] [GRI 102- 26] During the meeting held on 5 May 2017, the Board of Directors 
appointed Directors Giu seppe Recchi, Arnaud de Puyfontaine and Flavio Cattaneo to the respective offices of Executive 
Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TIM S.p.A. .  
On 1 June 2017, having acknowledged the approval of the Vivendi -TIM concentration given by the European Commission on 30 
May 2017, the TIM Board of Directors renewed the governance structures and completed its internal organisation, appointing, b y 
majority vote, Arnaud de Puyfontaine as Executive Chairman and Giuseppe Recchi as Deputy Chairman. The Board also 
conferred delegations and powers upon the Executive Chairman, in addition to those due him by law as Chairman of the Company.  
On 24 July 2017, the Chief Executive Officer, Flavio Cattaneo resigned, with effect as from 28 July 2017. The succe ssion process 
was therefore launched, upon the conclusion of which, in the Board meeting held on 28 September 2017 (and therefore until the  
next Shareholder's meeting), Amos Genish was co -opted as Director. During this same meeting, the Board appointed Mr Genish 
as Chief Executive Officer
1 and resolved to hire him immediately as an employee of the Company, in a managerial role (General 
Manager). In addition to conferring powers on the newly -appointed Amos Genish, the powers, the delegations to the Chairman 
and Deputy Chairman were also confirmed and re -attributed, with some amendments.  
•  The proxies and powers granted to the Chairman, in addition to overseeing the strategic, industrial and financial planning processes, include 
[GRI 102 -32] responsibility for C orporate Shared Value activities (including preparation of the 
Sustainability Report) and governance of Fondazione TIM.  
[GRI 102 -19] [GRI 102 -20] [GRI 102- 26] The proxies and powers granted to the Chief Executive Officer include overall 
responsibility for the company and administration activities, responsibility for the development and implementation of strategic, 
industrial and financial plans and all the organizational responsibilities to ensure the management and development of the 
business in Italy and South America.  
[GRI 102 -19] [GRI 102 -20] The system by which the executive directors (Executive Chairman and CEO) delegate powers to the 
departments that report to them is the subject of a specific company procedure that establishes the methods by which this system must be implemented (Granting and Revocation of Powers). Powers are normally granted to those reporting directly to 
the Executive Directors and, in particular, for matters of an economic and financial nature, they are granted to those reporting to the Chief Executive Officer who deal w ith such matters, while for sustainability the powers are delegated to the party in

Relationship Department reports. Those reporting dire ctly can in turn assign specific powers to specific departments;  
[GRI 102 -21] in particular, powers are granted in this way to manage relations with stakeholders (customers, suppliers, public 
administration, employees, etc., described in the Stakeholder Engagement section of this document).  
[GRI 102 -25] The company procedure for transactions with related parties1, drawn up in accordance with Consob Regulation 
no. 17221 of 12 March 2010, is systematically updated (the latest revision is dated 28 September 2017) and is illustrated in the 
Report on Corporate Governance and Share Ownership (Directors' Interests and Transactions with Related Parties). The disclosure of any transactions with related parties during the relevant period is included in the "Transact ions with related 
parties" chapter of the Annual Financial Report.  
On 16 October 2017 and 2 November 2017 the Presidency of the Council of Ministers issued orders based on the preliminary 
investigation into the exercising of power deriving from the “Golden  Power” regulations. Further details can be found in the 
Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
[GRI 102 -29] [GRI 102- 30] [GRI 102 -11] The internal control and risk management system consists of a set of rules, 
procedures and organisational structures intended to ensure the healthy and proper management of the company, in a way 
that is consistent with the established goals, through an appropriate key risk identification, measurement, management and monitoring process. Being responsible for the internal control and risk management system the Board of Directors defines the 
system guidelines, verifying their adequacy, effectiveness and proper operation, so as to ensure that the main risks facing t he 
company (including operational, compliance, economic and f inancial risks) are correctly identified and managed over time.  
The establishment and maintenance of the internal control system are entrusted to the Executive Directors, each in his/her ow n 
delegated area, and to the Executive responsible for preparing th e company's accounting documents in his/her area of 
responsibility, so as to ensure the overall adequacy of the system and its effectiveness, from a risk -based perspective, which is 
also considered when determining the agenda of Board meetings. Coordinatio n between the parties involved in the internal 
control and risk management system is illustrated in the Report on Corporate Governance and Share Ownership.  
The internal control system is contained in the so -called “Organisational Model 231”, i.e. an organi sational and management 
model adopted pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001, aimed at preventing offences that may result in liability for the company.  
[GRI 102 -33] [GRI 102- 34] [GRI 102 -17] In November 2015, TIM implemented the new Whistleblowing proced ure2, which 
provides for the centralised management, by the Audit Department, of all reports - including those that are the responsibility of 
the Board of Statutory Auditors, particularly in its role as the 231 Supervisory Body - via a compute app which whistleblowers 
can use to access the company intranet. Since 2016, this reporting channel has also been accessible via the Group's website. 
Reports may be made by any employee, collaborator, consultant, freelance worker, as well as third parties who have bus iness 
relations with the Group. The system assigns each report a unique identification code which enables the whistleblower to chec k 
the processing status in anonymity.  
                                                                    
1 The terms "related party" and  "related parties" of TIM are understood to refer to the parties defined as such in the Consob Regulation. Regardless of 
whether they can be defined as related parties according to accounting principles, the Procedure also applies to the parties to signifi cant shareholders' 
agreements, pursuant to article 122 of the CLF that govern candidacies for the position of Director of the Company, if it tur ns out that the majority of 
Directors appointed has been drawn from the slate presented by  participants in shar eholders’ agreements.  Additional details available "Related party 
Transactions and Directionand Coordination Activity” in Annual Financial Report.  
2 The aforementioned Procedure is being updated, also following the entry into force of Law no. 179 of 30 No vember 2017, “Provisions on the protection of 
parties reporting offences or irregularities they become aware of in the context of a public or private employment relationsh ip”  
TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM GROUP 
  
19 [GRI 102 -17] [GRI 103 -1] As stated in article 4 of the Group Code of Ethics and Conduct, any requests for clarification regarding 
the appropriateness of one's own conduct or the conduct of other people, in order to ensure full compliance with the Code and  
the values set by the Co de itself, must be addressed to the Head of the Audit Department of TIM S.p.A. or to the Head of the 
Audit Department of the Group's overseas company directly involved, in accordance with specific internal procedures.  
[GRI 102 -17] Using the Whistleblowing procedure, the entities must be promptly informed of the following by the recipients of 
the Code and those who have undertaken to comply with it:  
•  any violations, requests or inducements to violate legal provisions or regulations, provisions of the Code and  internal 
procedures with regard to the activities and services of interest to the Group;  
•  any irregularities or negligence in accounting procedures, keeping of relevant accounting documentation, fulfilling reporting  
obligations or internal management in Group companies.  
There are no negative consequences for people who make reports in good faith.  
The confidentiality of the identity of people making reports is in any case guaranteed by appropriate internal procedures, su bject 
to legal requirements. No recipi ent of the Code, employee or third party having business relations with the Group can be subject 
to sanctions or otherwise discriminated against if he/she refuses to perform actions or adopt a conduct which are considered,  in 
good faith, to infringe the Code, even if this refusal should result in a loss of business or other adverse consequence for the 
company's business and/or the Group. TIM Participações uses an automated end -to-end management system of reports, 
accessible via the intranet and from the com pany’s website, automatically recording all reports received and allowing the 
reporter to monitor the progress made on each case.  
[GRI 102 -34] In 2017, the Whistleblowing procedure resulted in 150 reports made in Italy and 703 in Brazil. The Human Rights 
section illustrates the reports received concerning alleged violations of Human Rights and employment rights.  The Board of 
Statutory Auditors' Report states the number of reports received by the Board of Statutory Auditors and provides a summary of  
the asse ssments carried out by the Board itself. In 2017, no substantiated reports were received relating to Human Rights for 
which the 231 Supervisory Board is competent.  
[GRI 102 -35] [GRI 102 -36] The remuneration policy for the members of the Board of Directors is determined in accordance 
with legal requirements and the by -laws, according to which: 
•  [GRI 102 -36] the Shareholders' Meeting determines the total gross annual remuneration of the Board of Directors (and of 
the directors holding specific offices: Executi ve Chairman and CEO); expresses an opinion on the first section of the 
Remuneration Report (RR); passes resolutions regarding remuneration plans based on the allocation of financial 
instruments;  
•  The Board of Directors resolves, on the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, on the allocation of the fees determined by the Shareholders' Meeting (when established as a total amount for the body as a whole); it defines, again on the proposal of the Committee, the remuneration policy of Executive D irectors and Key Managers with Strategic 
Responsibilities.  
The Board of Directors is also responsible for making proposals to the Shareholders' Meeting regarding remuneration plans based on the allocation of financial instruments for Directors and employee s and for drawing up the Remuneration Report (RR).  
[GRI 102 -36] In order to ensure that the choices made regarding remuneration are appropriately investigated, in accordance 
with the rules on transparency and the strict regulations on potential conflicts o f interest, the Board of Directors relies on the 
support of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.  In performing its duties, the Committee (the meetings of which are 
attended by the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors or, if he/she is unavailable, by another Auditor appointed by 
him/her) relies on the assistance provided by appropriate structures of the Company and can also rely on the support of external  
TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM GROUP 
  
20 consultants whose position does not compromise their independence of judgement. Following the renewal of the Board of 
Directors, the Committee availed itself of the assistance and support offered by Egon Zehnder for 2017, having first ascertai ned 
that it was not in a position to compromise the independence of judgement. 
[GRI 102 -35] With the ex ception of the Executive Chairman and the CEO, the Directors receive fixed remunerations only. The 
“Remuneration paid to members of the management and control body and key managers with strategic responsibilities” table 
in the Remuneration Report (RR) stat es all the types and amounts of remuneration received by each director. Details of the fixed 
and variable remuneration components (including any stock option), benefits and severance pay attributed to the CEO, the Chairman and the key managers with strateg ic responsibilities, as well as the targets for the variable component of the CEO's 
remuneration are illustrated in detail in the Remuneration Report. In particular, the objectives assigned to the Chair man and 
CEO for 2018 are mainly of an economic and financial nature, with the exception of the Customer Satisfaction indicator for the CEO and the assessment – by the Board of Directors – of the effectiveness in managing the activities of the Board of Directors 
itself, attributed to the Chairman. The sustainability targets used to determine the management incentive system are stated in 
the Remuneration Policies section of the TIM People section of this report.  
 
Sustainability governance and management  
[GRI 102 -18] [GRI 102- 26] Monitoring of the Group’s socio -environmental themes, as well as the identification of sustainability 
initiatives and projects, lie with the Sustainability Reporting, Monitoring and Relationship Department, hereinafter “SRMR” - for 
Administration and Fina ncial Reporting - and the Corporate Digital Communication & CSV Projects Department, which reports 
to the Head of Institutional Communication.   
The SRMR Department reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Sustainability Report/Con solidated 
Non -Financial Statement and periodically reports to the Control and Risk Committee. The latter acts as a corporate 
sustainability overseer, ensuring the consistency of actions carried out with the principles of the Group's Code of Ethics an d 
Conduct and with the values adopted by the Group and reference regulations. [GRI 102 -31] During 2017, the Board of Directors 
met the parties responsible for sustainability activities once.  
[GRI 102 -32] The Sustainability Report, including the materiality analysis, is the responsibility of the Chairman of the Board of 
Directors and is submitted for approval to the Board of Directors. The Control and Risk Committee acts as a corporate social 
responsibilit y overseer, ensuring the consistency of actions carried out with the principles of the Group's Code of Ethics and with 
the values adopted by the Group. 
[GRI 102 -19] Socio- environmental responsibilities are delegated, in the same way as all other powers delegated by the 
company, by applying the procedure granting and revoking powers. In particular, [GRI 102 -20] responsibility for monitoring and 
communicating environmental and social issues rests with the SRMR Department, which draws up the Sustainability Rep ort, 
manages relations with rating agencies and also oversees the implementation of particular projects. Responsibility for managing particular socio- environmental themes remains with the departments that directly manage operations related to 
these themes. 
[GRI 102 -26] These latter departments in particular identify specific strategies and targets for improving socio -
environmental performance, each department in its own area of responsibility.  
[GRI 102 -21] Responsibility for dialogue with stakeholders is d elegated to the departments that are operationally responsible 
for dealing with the Company's stakeholders.

Fight against corruption  
[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach]  [GRI 205]  The correctness of corporate conduct, and in particular the fight against 
corruption, is a material topic for any company and even more so for a Group that operates as a “system company,” integrated 
with the region and with its social, economic and productive context, with a pervasive role for the entire Italian and Brazilian

23 economy and for the competitiveness of their companies, the efficiency of their local government bodies and, more generally, 
the welfare of their citizens. Corrupti on is widely recognised as one of the factors threatening socio -economic growth and the 
well-being of the population.  
The fight against corruption has always been an important part of the TIM Group's internal control system. The tool for 
identifying, prev enting and controlling corruption risks is "Organisational Model 231” (including the Code of Ethics) approved by 
the Board of Directors in 2003 and subsequently updated and approved in July 2017, with reference to the offences of inciting  
corruption betwee n private subjects, corruption between private subjects, and unlawful intermediation and exploitation of 
labour – the crime of 'caporalato', that is illegal recruitment and employment at below the legal minimum wage – update to the 
market abuse regulations ), which also refers, in application terms, to the Group's specific Anti -Corruption Policy1 adopted in 
December 2012.   
TIM’s Compliance Department, which reports to the Board of Directors, provides operational support to the Supervisory Bodies 
(SB), perfo rming specific compliance interventions also based on the evidence received via the information flows established 
within the Group, achieved by examining reports for which the SB is responsible, forwarded by the Audit Department following a 
preliminary ana lysis and/or the conclusion of the communication process stipulated by the whistleblowing procedure.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 205]  Organisational Model 2312 identifies the processes that are at risk of 
corruption offences, including: manageme nt of relations with public entities, negotiation with customers, identification and 
management of counterparts in commercial relations, partnerships, joint ventures, participation in associations, purchase of shareholdings, purchase of goods and services,  consulting and professional services, selection, recruitment and employment of 
personnel. In application terms, a specific Group Anti- Corruption Policy was also adopted
3. 
As regards TIM Participações , the Company adopted the foreign version of the Organisational Model in accordance with the 
local anti- corruption law (ley 12846/13) and the relevant provisions required at Group level. On 6 October 2016, the Board of 
Directors of TIM Participações approved a new version of the Organisational Model which inclu des specific references to 
extending the application of the Model to private entities. Previously, Brazil had adopted corruption prevention procedures, 
including the Anti -Corruption Policy of May 2013.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 205]  No incident  of corruption has taken place in the Group companies in the last 3 
years. The aim is to maintain this level. The Head of the Compliance Department is appointed by the Board of Directors of the  
Company to which it reports. The variable short -term remuneration policy (MBO) assigns the Head of Department objectives in 
keeping with the prevention of crimes under Legislative Decree 231/2001.    
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 205]  Employees are trained every time the Organisational Model undergoes 
substantial changes. TIM has made the e -learning training modules on Organisational Model 231 and anti -corruption aspects 
available to Company bodies of all national subsidiaries. TIM Braz il has provided online courses relating to the “Anti -Corruption 
Compliance Program” (Organisational Model).

24 The project for the adoption of Standard 37001, which defines the “Anti -Corruption Management System” within TIM S.p.A., was 
approved by the Control and Risk Committee on 11 November 2017. The project is expected to be implemented in 2018.  
The Group's commitment to the topic is also demonstrated by its participation in various working groups. TIM is a member of 
the “231 and Legality” working group or ganised as part of the initiatives taken by Confindustria and participates in the working 
groups set up at B20 for the implementation of the recommendations made at G20/B20 level on anti -corruption matters. In 
2017 a working group was set up within Confind ustria to develop a toolkit for small and medium enterprises, taking into account 
the results of the questionnaire carried out to 'adapt' the toolkit to the Italian context, as part of the “Legality 231” wor king 
group of Confindustria, which TIM participat es in, a questionnaire was prepared to be given to 100 SMEs to assess the 
entrepreneurs’ awareness of the risk of corruption crimes and the dissemination of 231 Models. Moreover, in collaboration wit h 
the subsidiary Alfabook, a digital learning module on t opics concerning anti -corruption law (school- work alternation course, 
marketed in the 4th quarter of 2017) was developed for secondary schools.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 205]  As regards clarification requests or presumed corruption activities, TIM 
provides everyone (employees, collaborators, consultants, customers, third parties in general) with a single channel through 
which to submit a report with the maximum guarantee of confidentiality. This channel (whistleblowing) attributes a unique identification code to each report entered, which allows the reporter to check the processing status in complete anonymity. 
 
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 205]  In terms of external recognition, TIM  came fourth place in the TRAC 
(Transparency in Reportin g on Anti -Corruption) Telecom Report 2015, in relation to the adoption of an anti -corruption 
programme; the assessment was made at a global level by the organization Transparency International and involved 35 
telecommunications companies.   
[GRI 103 -2: Mana gement Approach]  [GRI 205]  Moreover, since 2016, TIM has participated in the  Business Integrity Forum 
promoted by Transparency Italia to develop activities in the private sector relating to cultural programmes and the dissemination of tools to support integrity, transparency and anti -corruption. In December 2017, the Compliance Department 
participated in the “Italian Business Integrity Day” promoted by the Anti -Corruption Coordination Department of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs at the OCSE offices in Pari s as part of the working group on bribery.  
[GRI 205 -1b] The areas identified as being at risk of corruption are:  
•  gifts and entertainment expenses  
•  events and sponsorships  
•  donations/membership fees/contributions to non -profit organisations  
•  consulting, intermediation, relations with business partners and suppliers  
•  joint ventures, acquisitions and transfers  
and furthermore:  
•  sale of goods and services  
•  relations with Institutions/Authorities  
•  authorisations and concessions  
•  subsidised financing  
•  legal and arbi tration proceedings  
•  health and safety at work obligations  
•  environmental protection obligations

25 •  selection, recruitment and employment of personnel  
•  operations carried out by the Executive Directors  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 205]  The above areas are the criteria by which processes or activities are judged to 
be at risk or not (each process/activity is at risk if it includes these areas).   
[GRI 205 -1a] Organisational Model 231 currently covers all Business Units of the Group.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 205] In the case of Italian companies, 231 Organisational Model and the anti -
corruption policy are communicated to all employees while commercial partners are required to confirm their adherence to the 
principles contained therein. Note also that the on -boarding training provided to new recruits at TIM S.p.A. included specific anti -
corruption sessions. In 2016, 1,208 employees completed a digital learning model on the handling of inside information at workstations (Market Abuse). As previously explained, the training campaigns are not necessarily annual but dependent on the changes made to the Model or other organisational requirements.
 
In 2017, the course on the Anti -Corruption and Whistleblowing Policy was delivered, which involved employees of the parent 
Company and main subsidiaries (the last, as at 8 January 2018, had been completed in TIM S.p.A . by 33,335 resources, making 
for approximately 73% of the target: if we consider the main subsidiaries as well, the number of employees who completed the course is 34,421 resources, equal to approximately 73% of the target), as shown by the tables below:

[GRI 205 -3a] [GRI 205 -3b] [GRI 205 -3d] No incident of corruption has taken place in the Group companies in the past 3 years, 
nor have any legal proceedings been started on grounds of corruption against Group companies in the same period. It follows 
that none of the Group's companies recorded penalties or concluded plea bargains in relation to corruption in the last three 
years.   
[GRI 205 -3c] With regard to suppliers, in the past 3 years TIM has never terminated a contract for reasons related to corruption.  
 
 
Legal framework and compliance  
The Group's activities are conducted in full compliance with current laws in the countries in which it operates and with 
universally accepted ethical principles, based on transparency, fairness and loyalty.  
[GRI 415 -1] In particular, the Code o f Ethics explicitly bans any direct or indirect disbursements, contributions, advantages or 
benefits of any kind to political parties, political movements or trade unions or to their representatives or candidates.  
[GRI 206 -1] The Group's main disputes in this respect are listed and described in the “Contingent liabilities, other information, 
commitments and guarantees ” Note of the Consolidated Financial Statements, particularly in the “ Significant disputes and 
pending legal actions section ”. [GRI 419 -1] The same Note contains a description of all the Group's other disputes.  
In its environmental management systems, the Group is very careful to comply with the environmental laws of the countries 
which it operates in, as reported in the Environmental Protection chapter.

27 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT  
TIM believes it is fundamentally important to consider the opinions and expectations of its stakeholders, namely the parties who 
for various reasons have an interest in the Company's activities.  
[GRI 102 -40] The stakeholders with whom TIM comes into contact in the conduct of its business are many and very varied. For 
ease of management they have been grouped into eight categories, the first six of which relate to the outside world and the 
remaining two relate to the internal world of the Company:  
•  customers 
•  suppliers  
•  competitors  
•  institutions  
•  environment  
•  community (including associations, universities and research centers, the education world, media, start- ups)  
•  shareholders  
•  human resources  
 
[GRI 102 -42] [GRI 102- 43] The stakeholder engagement process takes place regularly during implementation of corporate 
projects and activities involving listening to customers. More specifically, for customers, general satisfaction is measured 
(Customer Satisfaction Index), as are the conciliation procedures, as better described in the Value Chain section of this repor t.  
For each project, the affected stakeholders are identified and priorities are assigned based on the importance of the stakeho lder 
for the business objectives or on the basis of the Company's decision to focus on specific fields such as, for example, 
contributing to the economic or cultural growth of the Country with projects not strictly connected with business.   
Once the relevan t stakeholders have been identified for the project, the most suitable strategies for building relations are 
studied, which can include individual meetings, group meetings, information sessions, shared projects, surveys, focus groups,  
etc. 
The feedback that the various stakeholders provide to TIM is analysed to identify solutions the Company can offer to satisfy the 
specific requirements. At the end of the feasibility analysis and verification process, TIM decides which solutions to offer,  which 
projects and which initiatives to undertake. Stakeholder involvement continues beyond this and serves to monitor and adjust 
the initiatives.  
 TIM has drawn up general guidelines for group stakeholder engagement  and a set of policies associated with different kinds o f 
stakeholders, including customer service charters, a policy on relations with suppliers in purchasing processes, the code of conduct 
for protecting the data of other local operators, guidelines for relations with local authorities and other organisations , guidelines 
for voluntary contributions to the Community.  
 
Shareholders  
 
The Group is aware of the importance of providing accurate information on its activities to the financial market, investors a nd 
the community in general.  
Subject to the need for confidentiality in the running of the business , communication with the financial market is carried out in a 
way that ensures transparency, fairness, clarity, promptness and equality of access to information, ensuring equality of  
TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM GROUP 
  
28 treatment for all categories of shareholders, as required by the bylaws.  The external communication of information is governed 
by specific internal procedures, in line with the regulations in force.  
 
The Company has set up dedicated channels of communication  with shareholders, bondholders and stakeholders interested in 
receiving information about the financial and non -financial aspects of the C ompany.  
 The Investor Relations Department manages relations with the main stakeholders:  institutional and retail in vestors (including 
small shareholders' associations), bondholders, socially responsible investors, equity and credit analysts.  
Once again in 2017 the Company organized quarterly conference calls, road shows abroad, meetings with the institutional 
offices of the Group (reverse road show) and participation in sector conferences; these activities were accompanied by direct contacts and phone conversations managed by the Investor Relations team on a daily basis.  
For a detailed focus on the activities carried out over the year and the topics of greatest interest that emerged, refer to the 
“Information for Investors” section of the TIM Group's 2017 Annual Financial Report and the dedicated area of the website www. telecomitalia.com . 
 
The “TI Alw@ys ON” Shareholders' Club ( www.telecomitalia.com/individuali ) was launched in 2006 as a virtual meeting place 
for the Company and its individual investors. Free acc ess to the Club allows you to subscribe to and receive economic -financial 
information services (weekly stock market report, SMS alerts, etc.).  
Financial communication, finally, focuses on the web as an important means of sharing information with the outsi de world: in 
this sense, the Investors channel on the website www.telecomitalia.com  is constantly updated with presentations of the 
quarterly financial results, intermediate and annual reports, notices and d ocumentation useful for the Shareholders' Meeting 
and the financial calendar of the Company.  
 
[[GRI 102 -43] [GRI 102- 44] The Group's main stakeholder engagement initiatives  taken in 2017 are summarised below.  
In the diagram each initiative is marked by an  icon that represents the type of relationship:  
•  "information" refers to one -way communications by the Company with stakeholders;  
•  "consultation" refers to the occasions when stakeholders are asked for their opinion through surveys or similar tools;  
•  "dialo gues" refers to the discussions and ongoing and stable cooperation between the Group and stakeholders;  
•  "partnership" refers to the specific projects that are managed together.  
At the end of 2017, TIM updated and examined the external perception of the importance of material topics by consulting 
a group of authoritative representatives of its stakeholders through the collaborative platform Re2N1. 
50 people were interviewed, 23 of which responded as representatives of institutions, suppliers, customers, comp etitors, 
the environment and the community, providing their views on the most important topics for TIM’s strategy.  
This initiative is part of the new methods TIM has adopted for the materiality  analysis (described in the dedicated paragraph 
in this chapte r) to exploit the potential of digital transformation, also as part of the sustainability activities. TIM intends to 
develop stakeholder engagement and collaboration initiatives on the same platform in 2018 with the twofold aim of making the 
exchange and engagement of stakeholders more fluid and continuous, and at the same time organizing initiatives undertaken

30 MATERIALITY MATRIX  
[GRI 102 -46] In 2017, in compliance with the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative Standards, TIM conducted a 
materiality analysis with the aim of identifying the material topics as regards the socio -environmental and economic impacts of 
the business activit ies both within and outside the Company.  
Methodology  
In light of the lack of change to the material topics that emerged during the multistakeholder forums in 2015 and 2016, 
described on the Group’s website in the sustainability section, TIM deemed it appro priate to start an analysis to verify the 
validity of the material topics. The process therefore complies with the "Guidelines for updating the TIM materiality analysi s,” 
updated to the GRI Standard s in 2017. With a view to considering a broader scenario of material topics concerning the sector, 
the activity was conducted through the use of semantic analysis methodologies1 for a detailed analysis, validated by a large 
number of information sources in order to intercept and map the material topics and compar e them with the material themes 
identified by TIM in 2016.  
The first activity carried out was the definition of the correct taxonomy2 to be used in the semantic engine. The taxonomy used 
by TIM was created on the basis of different references in the fields  of sustainability and digital. Specifically:  
•  Global Reporting Initiative Standard s, ISO26000, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and specialist assessments3; 
•  The Italian Digital Agenda, Objectives of the European Digital Single Market and dedicated inde xes4.  
The documents linked to the Group’s core business were subsequently identified and collected for analysis, selecting national  
and international, public and non -public sources, internal and external to TIM5.  
The semantic engine analysed all the sources of information with different interactions. This process led to the definition of a list 
of topics based on the occurrences6  found in the various documents and the logical correlations between them, establishing 
hierarchies between the topics. This made it possible to define the relationship structure of topics in the subsequent phases of 
the analysis.  
Finally, the material topics were identified through the occurrences. The final result is a 'tree' of sector -based topics, which has 
been compared with the topics which emerged from the 2016 'tree'.  
                                                                    
1 The techniques involve automatic text analyses designed to extract structural data which codify the semantic component of textual content. The 
algorithms of the semantic engine that analysed all the sources of information were trained with “sustainability” and “digita l” components.  
2 Each taxonomy is made up of interrelated concepts and keywords with different correlation and significance levels. Each taxonomy was constructed 
using both Italian and English terms   
3 For example RobecoSam (Dow Jones Sustainability Index), FTSE4good and Sustainalytics questionnaires   
4 For example the Digital Economy Society Index which monitors different aspects of the digitisation level of the individual European countries 
5 For example: The “Piano Nazionale italiano per l’Agenda 2030” (Italian National Plan for the 2030 agenda) of the Italian gove rnment, the “Ernst & Young 
Megatrends  report 2015”, the “Fair and Sustainable Well -Being in Italy 2016” (BES) report promoted by the National Council for Economy and Labour 
(CNEL) and the National Institute for Statistics (ISTAT)  
6 The occurrences identify the number of times that a concept (or a specific term) is detected within the document by the seman tic engine and provide an 
indication of the significance of the topic detected in the context of the document   
TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM GROUP 
  
31 Identification of the material topics  
At the end of the analysis, TIM was able to draw up a list of topics representing the following macro areas:  
•  correctness of corporate conduct  
•  impact on the region and community in which the company operates  
•  strategies and responsible management of the supply chain  
•  management of the workforce and development of internal employment  
•  management of the health and safety of workers  
•  service quality, customer relations, protect ion of vulnerable categories 
•  safeguarding privacy and personal data security and protection  
•  environmental protection  
•  geographic and social digital inclusion  
•  support in the development of inclusive, sustainable education and digital skills  
•  development of di gital infrastructures with new generation, UBB and LTE networks  
•  management and reduction of negative impact on human rights with dedicated actions   
Attribution of relevance scores to the topics  
On the basis of the 'tree', TIM started the process of defini ng the relevance of the material topics for the Company and the 
stakeholders. The internal viewpoint was provided by Top Management which, thanks to the involvement of a significant 
sample of representative contact people from all the company's departments , expressed its opinion on the relevance of each 
topic to TIM’s strategy1.  
As mentioned, the collection of the external viewpoint2 was facilitated through innovative tools such as semantic analyses and 
big data, based on last year’s findings.  
This approach has enabled TIM to:  
•  extend listening to more stakeholders;  
•  making the observation of the topics dynamic in order to measure their evolution over time.  
 
 
                                                                    
1 Based on the follo wing scale: 1=barely influential; 2=limited impact; 3=direct influence; 4=significant influence; 5=decisive  
2 In line with last year’s activities, the stakeholders involved in the engagement activities were observed to which other enti ties were added. A total of 20 
stakeholders relating to: customers, suppliers, competitors, institutions, the environment and the c ommunity. To conduct the analysis three types of 
sources were identified:  
•  documents issued by stakeholders (in particular Sustainability Reports);  
•  statements made on company websites; 
•  discussions on social networks concerning the topics identified thanks to TIM Data Room activities

32 At the end of the analysis, TIM attributed a relevance score based on the occurrence of the topics1.  
The activity resulted in the following materiality matrix:   
 
 
The materiality matrix, in addition to highlighting the priority areas of commitment for TIM and its stakeholders, also refle cts the 
SDGs to which the Company believes it can make the biggest contribution through its core business.  
 
  
                                                                    
1 Scores ranged from 1 to 5, where 1 is the minimum frequency, 5 the maximum frequency, 3 the average frequency (calculated fro m the average 
occurrence of the topics taken into consideration). 2 and 4 are attributed in proportion to the minimum, average and maximum scores. Finally, the final 
score was calculated, weighted by the significance attributed to each source according to the different time periods covered in the analysis

36 Validation  
The validation of the topics and of the entire materiality analysis process was carried out by the Sustainability Reporting, 
Monitoring and Relationship division of the Administration and Financial Reporting Department, with the support of RE2N, a 
company that develops innovative tools for sustainability and shared value1, and TIM Data Room. TIM Data Room is the 
department of TIM Group that analyses digital data from the internet through listening, reporting and benchmarking activities2. 
The governance of TIM's sustainability is explained in the Sustainability Governance paragraph of this document. The matrix 
was approved by the Control and Risk Committee on 4 December 2017.  
Review  
The review phase is expected to take place as a preparatory stage prior to the next reporting cycle, with the aim of submitting the results of the analyses carried out, updated the following year, to specific consultation and involvement activities as p art of 
stakeholder engagement. The Group has updated the "Guidelines for updating the TIM materiality analysis” so that they comply 
with the GRI Standards in order to establish a transparent structure for the analysis process.  
Boundaries  
[GRI 102 -47] All the topics that are judged to be material have major imp lications both inside and outside the Company and 
are cross -cutting topics that are relevant to all the consolidated companies in the Group, wherever these may be, without 
exception, and which are relevant to all external and internal stakeholders, these being. The material topics identified are:  
•  correctness of corporate conduct  
•  impact on the region and community in which the company operates  
•  strategies and responsible management of the supply chain  
•  management of the workforce and development of internal employment  
•  management of the health and safety of workers  
•  service quality, customer relations, protection of vulnerable categories  
•  environmental protection 
•  management and reduction of negative impact on Human Rights with dedicated actions  
Other topics ar e mainly relevant to Group companies acting as operators in the ICT world, which represent the main part of the 
Group in terms of turnover, employees and even in terms of the impact on external stakeholders:  
•  development of digital infrastructures with new generation, UBB and LTE networks  
•  safeguarding privacy and personal data security and protection  
•  support in the development of inclusive, sustainable education and digital skills  
•  geographic and social digital inclusion  
The topics mentioned above are more re levant to stakeholders who live in Italy, a Country where TIM is the main operator and 
the Company on which stakeholders pin their greatest expectations. In Brazil, where the Group is present as one of the 
Country's biggest mobile operators, the topics are  definitely relevant to stakeholders but to a lesser extent than in Italy.  
[GRI 102 -49] Finally, no significant changes have been recorded in the scope of activities (and therefore boundary relevant), in 
recent years.

37 Risks  
[GRI 102 -15] [GRI 102- 29] [GRI  102- 30] [GRI 102- 11] The Group has adopted an Enterprise Risk Management  Model  
(hereinafter ERM) which allows risks to be identified, assessed and managed uniformly within Group companies, highlighting 
potential synergies between the parties involved in a ssessing the Internal Control System. The ERM process is designed to 
identify potential events that may influence the business activity, in order to manage risk within acceptable limits and provide a 
reasonable guarantee that business objectives will be ac hieved.  
The process adopted is cyclical and includes the following stages:  
•  definition of the Risk Appetite and of the Risk Tolerances;  
•  Risk Assessment;  
•  Risk Response;  
•  drawing  up the Reporting Flows.  
The process is managed by the ERM Steering Committee, which is chaired and coordinated by the Head of the Security Department. The Steering Committee ensures the governance of the Group's risk management, aimed at guaranteeing the 
operational continuity of  the business, monitoring the effectiveness of countermeasures taken.  
For more details on the process and its phases, please refer to the link http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/sust ainability.html   
A summary of the risks connected with material themes is given in the table below, whilst a brief summary of the main types o f 
risk identified by the ERM system is contained in the Main Risks and Uncertainties chapter of the Annual Report.

Risks Management 
Risks linked to the quality perceived 
by customers  TIM monitors the perceived quality level through a complex survey system achieved 
with the support of leading research institutes and through the use of IT systems 
and analysis platforms. TIM Participações controls the quality level by means of 
operative performance indicators established by the Agência Nacional de 
Telecomunicações (ANATEL), which envisage objectives linked to quality and 
standards that must be respected by suppliers. TIM Participações is also 9001 
certified (International Organiz ation for Standardization) and has internal indicators 
aiming to monitor the mapping of gaps and implement mitigation plans.  
Risks linked to Customer Care 
operations  TIM promotes the dissemination of a culture geared towards customer experience and periodically shares the main guidelines for the caring model which define the 
reception and service model to be provided to customers. TIM has set up specialist groups with the aim of improving customer experience and commercial approach 
at the same time.  
Risks linked to privacy and data 
protection  TIM has a system of procedures and controls which ensure compliance with current 
regulations, puts in place concomitant monitoring activities on the evolution of the regulatory scenario and performs ongoing diss emination and internal training 
activities. In Italy, with particular reference to new General Data Protection Regulation no. 2016/679 on privacy, a series of activities are in place to analyse the impacts deriving from the application of the legislation and the production of the consequent operating instructions which the roles/companies concerned must 
comply with. In Brazil, TIM Participações has structured a process that establishes 
guidelines for the security of its customers’ data, where such is defined as confidential by Brazilian law. There are system control mechanisms in place, which 
prevent access by unauthorised staff and the dissemination of sensitive data.

and, also in keeping with the needs expressed by the control bodies, coordinates the identification of intervention areas on a priority basis in order to ensure the 
control and ma nagement of the overall cyber risk for the entire perimeter of TIM 
and its subsidiaries.  
The ICT Risk Management process contributes to the security of information by managing the process of assessing and handling the operational risks to ICT 
resources who handle information in order to ensure: a) a level of confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information proportional to the respective value of the business, that is the direct or indirect losses that a security incident can result in 
for the  services provided to its customers; b) the security of the services provided to 
its customers and the levels of operational continuity stipulated in the contracts; c) 
the security of the personal information of employees, in compliance with current 
legislation and for employees' protection. In Brazil, TIM Participações has adopted a 
procedure defining the security measures relative to IT systems and an advanced platform against computer attacks. TIM Participações monitors incidents related to 
computer attacks and malfunctions in data protection and notifies the parties 
concerned.

including:  
!!risk of tank pollution, correlated with the presence, dimensions and operation of the tanks containing liquid fuel;         
!!hydraulic risk: effects on the territory caused by exceeding the critical hydrometric 
levels (possible flooding along the main water courses);  
!!employee safety risk: risks connected with the health and safeguarding of safety at work of employees (e.g. asbestos, electromagnetic emissions of plants).  
In Brazil, TIM has an operating procedure in place for the disposal of used bat teries 
and network equipment in order to optimise and control any possible impacts. This 
procedure is integrated into the plan for disposal management, assistance and 
response to environmental emergencies and research into the environmental 
aspects and impacts, dangers and risks to health and safety at work. Action is also taken to monitor and limit electromagnetic radiation emissions.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach ] [GRI  302] [GRI  305]  The attention paid to the environment is reflected in the Sustainable 
Development Goals: prevention and control of climate change, land and marine life, design of smart cities, are targets on 
which companies are required to focus with concrete and measurable actions. The importance of environmental 
protection is indeed evident in the TIM 2017 materiality matrix.   
The ICT sector can contain and reduce its CO 2 emissions and above all can contribute to reducing emiss ions from other 
sectors and individual citizens thanks to its innovative and characterizing solutions: video -conferencing, teleworking, 
telemedicine and, in more general terms, all services connected with the digitisation of the economy that allow truly 
sustainable behaviors  and lifestyles to be achieved. It is estimated that1 adoption of these services could lead to a 20% 
reduction in global CO 2 emissions by 2030, thereby maintaining them at 2015 levels.  
In synergy with other sectors of the economy, TIM is  aware that it can play an important role in facilitating the transition 
to a future characterised by low carbon emissions.  
The Environment stakeholder consists of future generations and their right to live in a world not compromised by the negative and c ollateral effects of development by previous generations.  
The attention paid to the Environment is demonstrated by the demands expressed by  
•  national and international environmental organisations;   
•  national and  supranational  institutions ; 
•  the community in general, particularly in the areas where TIM operates;  
•  industry associations and non- profit organisations dealing with issues relating to the environment. These include the 
following in particular: European Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association  (ETNO), European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Global e -Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), CDP, International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU).  
 [GRI 103 -3: Management Approach ] [GRI  302]  First and foremost, the Group makes extensive use of advanced 
communication services to reduce the need for staff travel, and costs and emissions associated with business travel. For example, use is made of the automatic booking portal for “VAI On Line” audio and video conferencing services, Virtual 
Rooms and the new Smart On Line
2 service launched in 2017. With these procedures managed independently by 
employees, TIM recorded an overall increase in meetings held of +5% on 2016. In detail:  
•  VAI On Line: 41,763 video conferences held by TIM and other Group compa nies;  
•  VAI On Line: 78,692 audio conferences held by TIM and other Group companies;  
•  Smart On Line: 21,544 audio/video conferences held by TIM.  
 
                                                                    
1 #SMARTer2030 – ICT Solutions for 21st Century Challenges – published in 2015 by the Global e -Sustainability Initiative  
2  The Smart On Line service is based on the allocation of personal virtual meetings rooms  (FAN, Free Access Number) which are always available, where 
you can invite participants at any time, without time limits or the need to book them in advance. This is a technical evoluti on of the services already 
provided at the company, which guarantees g reater flexibility in terms of use and better quality

[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach ] [GRI  302] [GRI  305]  TIM also responded with four synergic levels of action regarding 
the fight against climate change:  
•  reducing its own direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases;  
•  limiting the emissions of other sectors of the economy and customers by supporting virtualisation and the provision of 
services that promote ne w sustainable ways of working, learning, travelling and living;  
•  adopting procurement policies that take into account the impact of climate change along the whole value chain;  
•  contributing to disseminating a culture that creates awareness of the importance  of the theme and the actions that 
everyone can put in place to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions within and outside the 
Company.  
This important matter is handled within the Group with the aim of mitigating and/or remedying the negati ve impacts 
linked in particular to the use of energy resources.  
In particular, the guiding principles of TIM’s strategy for the Environment are:  
•  optimising the use of energy sources and other natural resources;  
•  constantly seeking to improve environmental and energy performance by reducing negative impacts and increasing 
positive ones;  
•  adopting procurement policies that take environmental issues into account;  
•  disseminating a culture that promotes a correct approach to environmental issues.  
TIM has voluntari ly introduced environmental guidelines1 and policies for quality and the environment in some specific 
areas of the Group: the Technology Department and the Open Access Department (latest revisions issued in July 2017). Furthermore, TIM Sparkle has a qualit y, health and safety in the workplace and environment policy in force, which was 
also issued in July 2017.  
As early as 2012, furthermore, in 
Italy TIM signed a voluntary agreement with the Ministry of the Environment and 
Protection of the Land and Sea to promote joint projects aimed at measuring, containing and neutralising the impact of 
the telecommunications sector on the climate. In this context, analysis procedures have been created for the standard 
activities of telecommunication companies in order to  provide carbon footprint indicators for the services delivered by TIM 
across the country: fixed network (telephone calls), mobile network (text messaging, data transfers, calls), data transfers 
(including picture messaging)2.  
Furthermore, in order to ensure the effective and sustainable management of operational processes, the areas of TIM which 
have a potentially significant environmental impact have equipped themselves with a certified Environmental Management 
System (EMS) in  accordance with the ISO14001 standard. In some organisations, the Environmental Management System has 
been integrated with the Quality Management System based on the ISO 9001 standard, for which the respective certification 
has been obtained. At some part icularly representative sites, a certified Energy Management System has been developed 
according to the ISO 500013 standard.

[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 302] The energy efficiency of the Rozzano 2 Data Centre is demonstrated by 
the PUE1 (Power U sage Effectiveness) value of 1.66 certified in 2014, which can be considered a good value for a Data 
Centre built between 2008 and 2010. The PUE of the other Data Centres is currently undergoing certification.  
Brazil  
The operational activities of the technical network in the States of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Espirito Santo – the areas in 
which the country’s industrial and commercial activities are mostly concentrated - have had an ISO 14001 certification since 
2010. TIM Partecipaçoes activities are also carried out in accordance with its environmental policy2, revised in 2015, which 
underlines its commitment to reducing waste and using natural resources sustainably.  
 
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach ] [GRI  302] [GRI  305] The main indicators used to measure the Group's environmental 
performance are gathered voluntarily. Their trend  is shown in the table. For more details see the appendix .

[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI  302] [GRI  305] In order to ensure the development and implementation of 
programs for energy efficiency and the rational use of resources, issues relevant to TIM, a cross -cutting section has been created 
within the Procurement Department which is dedicated to dealing with  energy issues and to identifying and carrying out 
appropriate energy efficiency activities. This Utilities, Ser vices and Logistics Department is in charge of energy procurement, 
energy use planning and monitoring and efficiency project deployment in Italy . The medium -term variable remuneration policy 
(MBO) also provides for targets to be assigned to the managers connected with the achievement of energy efficiency targets 
which are consistent with the Group’s business plan.

Effective application of the reg ulations is monitored by means of a control system based on periodic self -assessment 
procedures, by those responsible for containing consumption. Furthermore, in order to respond to the objective of reducing 
negative effects and reinforcing positive behavi ours, a monthly report is drawn up describing the activities, the level of 
consumption containment, the results achieved and the status of the improvement plans. In addition to that, a new form of contract has been introduced which provides for a performance bond on maintaining and implementing projects. This ensures that service levels are maintained and makes it easier to predict the energy costs incurred by TIM.
 
In order to increase the sensitivity to environmental protection, a training dedicated to int ernal staff and business partners was 
carried out. In total, training meetings were held for a number of hours equal to 9 ,017, with the participation of about 3 ,100 
people.  
As mentioned above, the specific actions taken by the Group are intended to reduce its environmental effects and offer 
technological solutions to individuals, companies and government offices. The aim is to create an inclusive and sustainable digital society based on a strong low carbon economy.
 
The definition of fixed and mobile network architectures and the technical specifications of equipment and components also 
adopted criteria that minimise environmental impacts (e.g. consumption, excavation, obstacles, noise, use of batteries), whil e 
considering the service requirements and costs o f the various solutions. As of 2008 in particular, in performing the financial 
assessments of bids, the energy costs over a period of three to five years are also considered.  
 
Compliance with environmental legislation in force  
TIM provides everyone (employees, co -workers, consultants, customers, third parties in general) with a single channel through 
which to submit requests for clarification or reports of presumed violation of environmental legislation, with the maximum guarantee of confidentiality.  The system assigns each report submitted a unique identification code, which enables the reporter 
to check the processing status in complete anonymity
1.   
[GRI 30 7-1] As active and responsible members of the community, the Group's companies are committed to observing and 
ensuring the observance of the laws in force in the countries in which they operate and adopt the organisational tools needed  to 
prevent the violation of legal provisions.  
Italy  
During 2017, no significant financial penalties were imposed  on the Group's companies in Italy for violations of environmental 
legislation in the areas in which they perform their activities. This consideration is also valid for the previous two years.  
Brazil  
During 2017, a significant fine was imposed on TIM in Br azil2 for having brought radio base stations into operation without 
waiting for an environmental authorisation to be issued by the relevant authority. TIM lodged an appeal and obtained a reduction from 500,000 R$ to 50,000 R$. The fine was paid and the Company is now waiting for the environmental  licences  to

2 Significant financial penalties for the Group in Italy are considered to be those that exceed 500,000 euros. For its own accounting purposes, Brazi l applies 
an amount of  500,000 reais, which is roughly the equivalent of 126,031 euros

be issued to complete the administrative procedure. In 2016, a fine had been imposed due to alleged failure to comply with 
environmental rules1. The process for resolving this is still under way. In 201 5, another fine for the same reason as the one 
imposed in 2017 was resolved, while no fines were imposed in previous years.  
Also reported are 15 non -financial administrative penalties imposed on TIM  Brasil , while 7 had been imposed the previous year. 
There are no penalties of this kind to be reported for 2015. There are no resolutions of environmental disputes through 
conciliation mechanisms as there are no forms of conciliation for environmental disputes in Brazil.  
 
IoT and environmental research   
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 302] As a further demonstration of its commitment to the environment, every 
year TIM invests in research into innovative solutions for limiting environmental impacts, particularly in order to limit the  
consumption of n atural resources and energy. These activities are detailed in the following paragraphs.  
TIM has also had many patents granted in this area.  
TIM’s research activities include many Internet of Things (IoT) ICT solutions for the world of Smart Cities and posi tive 
environmental effects.  
Smart grid.  IoT application for managing various segments of electricity networks: TIM is studying solutions aimed at a better 
use of energy resources in terms of distributed generation and remote control. In particular, work c ontinued on the possibility of 
sharing telecommunication and power distribution network infrastructure with a view to cutting costs and reducing their environmental impact. 
 
Smart water . IoT application for managing water distribution networks. The solutio ns analysed allow hidden water leaks to be 
searched and identified efficiently and economically. Water is a valuable environmental resource: losses in the distribution network in the range of 30% will no longer be sustainable, from an environmental or econ omic perspective. Multi -utility 
smart 
metering  solutions (applications for real time usage monitoring), which cover water, gas and, if necessary, also electricity, based 
on widespread networks like IoT Narrowband2, are also being developed and tested in the field to search for leaks and optimise 
distribution costs.  
Smart waste . Efficient management of the waste cycle for increasing sorted collection and reducing illegal dumps. The fill levels 
of the various recycling centres are measured in real time and ve hicles sent out to empty them only when necessary. Result: 
time and expense are minimised and roadside bins overflowing with municipal rubbish are avoided. 
Other projects : in the field of eco -sustainability, the REPLICATE (Firenze Smart City) and MONICA (Torino Smart City) projects are 
particularly significant.  
                                                                    
1 Until last year, financial penalties were considered significant in Brazil if they exceeded 100,000 reais ((equivalent to 25,206 euros, 29.108,5 euros, 23,523 
euros applying the currency exchange rate on December 31st 2017, 2016, 2015 respectively). For this reason, 341 had been repo rted in the Sustainability 
Report for 2016

The REPLICATE1 project focuses on smart energy, smart mobility and smart waste solutions and the development of IoT 
platforms for managing the distribution of water and waste management in collaboration and partnership with the municipality 
of Florence. It was launched in February 2016 and will last for five years.  
The MONICA2 project is focused on urban noise pollution and safety in public life. The first applications developed as part of the 
project will be presented in the spring of 2018.   TIM has also contributed to the “Torino Smart City” project known as SMILE3, 
focusing on the theme of life & health, which has defined solutions and actions for improving quality of life and the 
environmental sustainability of the city. Based on input from the SMILE project, the Municipality of Turin has drawn up a master 
plan for Torino Smart City. TIM has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Municipality of Turin which provides for 
the use of 5G technologies to develop sustainable smart city services. The project, which began in July 2017, will be completed 
by mid -2020.

CLIMATE CHANGE  
[GRI 201 -2] COP231, held in Bonn in November 2017, made progress towards reviewing the commitments countries have made 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, despite the decision made by t he Trump administration to withdraw the United States 
from the Paris Climate Agreement  (COP21 – 2015).  However, the commitments made in Paris do not however seem sufficient to 
achieve the target agreed in 2015, that is to maintain the increase in global te mperature at under 2 degrees centigrade, and 
preferably under 1.5 degrees with respect to pre -industrial levels. A revision of the agreement will be the objective of the next 
United Nations Climate Conference, COP24, to be held in Katowice, Poland, in Dece mber 2018.  
According to a report2 by the European Environment Agency (EEA) there are ten most significant natural hazards for Europe: 
heat waves, torrential rain, overflowing rivers, wind storms, landslides, droughts, forest fires, avalanches, hailstorms and storm 
surges. Events that impact human health, the economy and ecosystems and can be exacerbated by other changes, such as soil 
sealing, construction in risk areas, ageing of the population or degradation of ecosystems.  
The overall documented economic losses generated by atmospheric events and  extreme weather conditions in the EEA's 33 
Member States over the period 1980 -2016 exceeded 450 billion euros. The biggest economic repercussions were caused by 
flooding (around 40%), followed by storms (25%), drought (around 10%) and heat waves (around 5%). Total insurance coverage 
for these hazards is around 35%. Reducing the impact of dangerous weather and climate events and adapting to climate 
change are therefore top priorities of the European Union. Achieving  these goals requires a strong commitment from all sectors 
of the economy, authorities and citizens .  
As explained earlier, TIM approaches the issue of climate change with multiple synergistic actions: reduction of its own direct 
and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases;  
•  limiting the emissions of other sectors and customers in general by supporting virtualisation and the provision of services and solutions which promote new sustainable ways of working, learning, travelling and living in general;
 
•  communicating its emissions and strategies for fighting climate change in the Sustainability Report and through responses provided to rating agencies (RobecoSAM, CDP, Vigeo Eiris, ...).
 
These objectives are pursued through the initiatives described in the following paragraphs on Environmental 
Performance/Energy and Environmental Performance/Emissions.

Risks associated with climate change  
[GRI 201 -2] The risks associated with climate change for the TLC sector, and therefore for TIM, have implications of a physical, 
economic and regulatory nature, with repercussions on the image and reputation of companies.   
Installations, network infrastructure and TIM Data Centres are spread across the Country. The Company believes that flooding is 
one of the most seriou s physical risks and the one most likely to occur. The resulting damage ranges from reduced use to the 
loss of business infrastructure, with a consequent zeroing of the capacity to supply the service.  
In order to prevent or limit the potential damage, TIM' s new exchanges and buildings are built at a safe distance  from rivers and 
bodies of water in general and, in order to ensure continuity of service, the network is designed considering appropriate lev els of 
resilience  and redundancy . 
TIM’s network infrastructure in areas characterised by a high level of hydro -geological risk are monitored through the Ci.Pro (Civil 
Protection) company system , which uses a constantly updated database of information on local areas and infrastructure for 
rapid planning of neces sary intervention.  
The company assets inevitably subject to physical risks have insurance cover  that takes into account the value of structures and 
equipment and any effects that catastrophic phenomena would cause to the service.  
In Brazil , changing climat e conditions are giving rise to extreme weather conditions increasingly often. Extreme weather 
conditions can damage the network infrastructure, particularly transmission towers and pylons, thus increasing the cost of 
management and insurance against risks , reducing coverage, weakening the signal and interrupting the service. Variations in 
the levels of humidity and salinity in the air can reduce the service life of equipment. An increase in the average temperatu re 
could lead to a greater use of electricity  by air conditioning and cooling systems. Potential flooding make s it difficult for staff to 
travel and do their work, thus reducing the efficiency of the system.  
TIM Brasil has developed technologies and applications for effective and continuous monitoring , making considerable 
investments in infrastructure and advanced technologies to guarantee the continuity and quality of service provided to its customers, improve efficiency and reduce the consumption associated with its operations.  
At present in Brazil most electricity is generated by hydroelectric plants (64% according to data from the Balanço Energético 
Nacional – 2016). Long periods of drought can lead to a dramatic reduction in the availability of electricity, to an increase in its 
cost and  to increasing recourse to fossil fuels. Lower availability of water in water basins may lead to the rationing of energy 
and significant fluctuations in the cost per kWh. 
A considerable amount of TIM Brasil’s  emissions is associated with electricity consum ption, particularly by the network 
infrastructure, which is expanding continuously in Brazil. Energy industry policies tend to lead to an increase in the cost o f 
energy and these increases are in turn transferred to users, and therefore also to TIM, which may see an increase in the cost of 
the goods and services it buys from suppliers, in particular those that produce telecommunications equipment and 
infrastructure.

Opportunities associated with climate change  
[GRI 201 -2] The ICT sector is required to con tribute to the fight against climate change  by making society aware of the 
importance of digitisation and virtualisation and reducing the need for the physical movement of people and things.   
Specifically:  
•  audio/video conferencing and agile working  services reduce the need for people to travel;  
•  online invoicing and payments  save paper (and therefore the energy required to produce and transport it) and eliminate the 
need for transport to make payments;  
•  telemedicine services reduce travel for medical visits;  
•  infomobility  systems, using information obtained from mobile handsets, allow the optimisation of traffic flows, reducing 
travel times and greenhouse gas emissions; 
•  systems for the monitoring and analysis of consumption  allow the optimisation of the energy efficiency of offices and 
dwellings.  
The efficiency improvements, savings achievable in economic terms and reduced environmental impacts associated with the 
effective use of these services are a real business opportunity for the Company. Awareness is growi ng among stakeholders and 
citizens in general of the need to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to ensure a sustainable future for 
society and the planet.  
Brazil  is also looking to develop solutions for mitigating and adapting to c limate change: TIM Brasil and the Ministry of Science, 
Technology, Innovation and Communication (MCTIC) have entered into a partnership to install precipitation data collection 
platforms at radio base stations (RBSs) close to areas where there is a high ri sk of natural disasters.  
In order to avoid a shortage of electricity for the opposite reason, namely a lack of rainfall, TIM Brasil is promoting initi atives 
aimed at reducing the consumption of services and installations. The Company believes that strategic carbon management, 
combined with transparent practices, is an opportunity to reach more customers in an increasingly demanding consumer 
market. In this context, TIM has the advantage of offering more efficient products and services, with reduced energy 
consumption or the use of alternative energy sources.  
The Company also believes that its telecommunications services can be used to reduce emissions from commuting. In addition 
to providing a basis for optimising production processes and logistics i n various sectors, they help customers to reduce their 
emissions.  
Similarly, climate change affects the behaviour of investors, who prioritise companies that are transparent about managing 
their own emissions.  
As a demonstration of its commitment, TIM Part icipações S.A .’ s place in the BM & FBovespa’s Corporate Sustainability Index 
(ISE)1 has been confirmed for the tenth year running.  Since 2010, TIM Brasil has also participated in the national EPC - Empresas 
pelo Clima programme2.

TIM INITIATIVES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT  
 [GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI  302]  Listed below are some of the TIM services and initiatives where the 
company’s technology, know -how, structures and sensitivity are being deployed and converging to achieve a sustainable world.  
 
Energy effi ciency improvement work  
Civil and industrial  
In 2017, technological developments in fixed and mobile network infrastructure and IT solutions are resulting in a significan t 
annual increase in the Group’s energy consumption.  
In Italy TIM has been proactive not only in offsetting this by constantly striving to ensure the efficiency and optimisation of the 
solutions adopted, but it has also obtained a positive balance  corresponding to net savings of over 10 GWh .  
Furthermore, during the first ha lf of 2017, further actions  were considered and planned to adapt and improve the efficiency of 
fixed network exchanges, carried out in the second half of the year, with the aim of increasing the percentage of reduction i n 
the quantity of energy used compar ed to previous years. In order to identify potential areas for efficiency improvement, 
analyses of all the sites not currently covered by plans for efficiency improvement were carried out.  
 
Obsolete technological platform decommissioning  initiatives contin ued, mainly in relation to the following projects:  
•  Fixed network : the project involves the migration of traditional accesses (except for ISDN accesses) to more advanced 
platforms (VoIP). This results in reduced energy consumption, occupation of space and m aintenance, and in general in the 
overcoming of the obsolescence of the traditional plants. Around 2,900,000 PSTN ports were switched off and/or migrated 
in 2017, amounting to 15% of the total.  
•  A plan was launched in 2015 to decommission the Urban Group Stages  (UGSs) by consolidation, in order to significantly 
reduce electricity consumption. Activities were completed on 27 UGSs in 2017, out of a total of 54 included in the plan. The project involves obtaining Energy Efficiency Certificates (white certific ates), cutting other operating costs and reducing the 
risk of failure resulting from the obsolescence of certain pieces of equipment. The estimated reduction in consumption at 
full capacity is 3.7 GWh per year, amounting to 50% of the expected total. 
 
•  ATM : the project involves optimizing data accesses with the gradual disposal of ATM devices and a shift to IP technology 
devices. This results in reduced energy consumption and in general the overcoming of the obsolescence of the traditional 
plants. Over the c ourse of the year 1.3 million ports were switched off, amounting to around 21% of the total at the end of 
2016.   
 
•  Other action taken in the industrial field includes plans to modernise obsolete business systems by simplifying the architecture. In fact, energy efficiency can be improved by gradually decommissioning pre- existing systems and platforms

The following actions were undertaken in 2017:  
Offices  
BEMS (Building Energy Management System) Project : in the second half of 2017, an analysis was undertaken of the energy 
efficiency  improvement plan for 20 particularly energy -intensive offices/DPCs/mixed use sites not covered by decommissioning 
plans over the coming three years, optimising the automatic performance management systems of the building to ensure 
minimum energy use with the same operating conditions. The BEMS system will be configured to operate with automatic 
control of the building’s technological systems. The works will involve a total of 50 sites, corresponding to consumption of around 280 GWh, with total estimated en ergy savings at full capacity of around 28 GWh (10% of the reference baseline), 
achieving savings of 10.5 GWh as early as 2018.  
Adaptive heating and cooling project : another proposal was made for the use of operating platforms that use consumption 
optimisa tion algorithms in cooling and heating units based on internal and external temperature conditions. As regards the 
optimisation of winter heating consumption, the project covered 11 sites which represent 12% of the total in terms of gas consumption for hea ting and 6% of the total sites, while one site was involved regarding air conditioning. The result achieved is 
a 35% reduction in gas consumption and a 15% reduction in electricity consumption . 
Fixed Network area  
•  Exchanges : a plan was launched to adapt power supply and air conditioning infrastructure units with the aim of achieving 
energy efficiency. The actions, completed at the end of 2017, covered 110 of the most energy intensive exchanges (UGSs and POPs), out of a total of 10,500, indicatively representing 11% of the total consumption of Exchanges - around 156 GWh per 
year in total - with a saving objective at full capacity of around 20 GWh
. The energy saved by the end of 2017 was around 4 
GWh (corresponding to 0.6 millio n euros) . 
•  Equipment:  a series of streamlining, rationalisation and optimisation measures were taken, aimed at reducing energy 
consumption in the UGS exchanges in metropolitan areas, with estimated savings at full capacity of around 4 GWh . The 
activity invo lved 44 UGSs and the energy saved in 2017 was around 17% of the amount forecast at full capacity . 
Data Cent ers  
•  Adaptive cooling of Da ta Centre  rooms:  during this first phase, the use of a previously tested solution to manage cooling 
systems with adaptive algorithms, which control the operation of air conditioners based on the thermal mapping of server 
rooms, was extended, thus reducing consumption from air conditioning. The energy savings when fully operational are 
expected to be around 1.2 GWh.   
•  Eco solut ion for IT infrastructure in the cloud : an increase was made in the number of machines set up with real- time 
controlled and dynamic switch -off of “farms in the cloud” servers based on virtualisation mechanisms with optimisation of 
the use of physical resou rces (CPU and RAM) and consequent energy savings. The solution, the efficiency of which has 
already been tested, improves the operation of IT farms in terms of performance and capacity planning information, 
enabling optimisation of the physical development  of IT platforms even if the processing load required increases. The 
estimated amount of energy saved at full capacity (2018) is approximately 0.6 GWh, 50% can already be recorded in 2017 .

IoRiciclo  
Pursuant to Ministerial Decree 121/2016, which implements European Directive 2012/19/EU, in 2017, TIM launched  ioRiciclo 
(meaning “I recycle”), a sustainable initiative to collect mobile phones and smartphones for scrapping, without any obligatio n to 
buy. In a selected number of TIM stores, distributed  throughout Italy, a free service has been activated to collect disused mobile 
devices, using the one- for-nothing formula: anyone can deliver their disused devices to a store, leaving it in a container without 
having to buy another product.  
The waste coll ected thus is sent for recycling. A mobile phone can in fact yield an average of 9 grams of copper, 11 grams of 
iron, 250 mg of silver, 24 mg of gold, 9 mg of palladium, 65 grams of plastic, 1 gram of rare earths and other precious eleme nts 
contained in ve ry small quantities. In addition to the recovery of materials, the recycling contributes to saving electricity and 
water, also avoiding CO 2 emissions.  
IoRiciclo is a project run in collaboration with Remedia, a non -profit organisation specialised in handin g WEEE (Waste Electrical 
and Electronic Equipment), spent batteries and accumulators. ioRiciclo continues the Company’s commitment to creating value 
and promoting sustainable development in its areas of influence, making the public aware of the importance of correctly 
managing the end -of-life stage of all electrical and electronic equipment. 
 
Consumer  Products : TIM  eco- friendly   
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI  302] [GRI 302 -5] ICT can influence the price, efficiency and relative convenience of 
product s and services, with an impact on the demand itself and increasing the overall demand for energy.  
In order to improve the environmental efficiency of products offered to private and business customers alike, attention has t o be 
paid to their energy aspects, optimising consumption while meeting the needs of the services delivered and applying "Design for 
Environment" rules that reduce their environmental impact, particularly during the production phase and the end -of-life 
management of equipment. It is the responsibility of the ICT sector, and therefore also of TIM, to consider these aspects, 
focusing on research and development to create products with a low environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle.  
At the end of the 1990s, TIM launched a seri es of internal research and development activities to build terminals with a reduced 
environmental impact.  
Pursuing and expanding this logic, the TIM Green logo has been created, renamed TIM eco -friendly in 2015, to identify both TIM's 
environmental protection initiatives and projects and eco -friendly products.  
For products and initiatives that bear this logo, information is provided about the features and specific solutions adopted, as a 
result of which their eco -friendliness and/or environmental benefit can be demonstrated. In the case of products, this 
information appears in the environmental statement drawn up in accordance with the UNI EN ISO 14021 standard, as well as in 
the sustainability section of the telecomitalia.com website, where information ca n also be found about the "eco- friendly" 
features of initiatives and projects.  
The TIM eco- friendly range includes dedicated products for businesses and consumers developed in cooperation with suppliers. 
The electricity savings also translate into an equivalent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The entire TIM eco -friendly

range of products are designed using eco -design criteria. The casing and packaging are made using uniform, recycled and/or 
recyclable materials.  
On the Access Gateway (AG) front, deployment of the latest “basic” Wi -Fi N modems, which have replaced the Wi -Fi N Access 
Gateway, the first product in the TIM eco -friendly1, is nearing completion. Mass distribution is under way of the “Smart Modem 
Plus” (also known as the “Access Gateway Evo” ), a top -of-the-range product that supports eVDSL accesses and premium voice 
and video services, fulfilling energy efficiency requirements according to the limits set by the European Code of Conduct for  
Broadband Equipment2, which TIM has adopted as a benchmark for consumer targets.

2017 v. 2015  (4)%   (13)%  28%  
The purchase of electricity from mixed sources  increased significantly in 2017  and 2016  compared to 2015 due to the decision 
not to purchase guarantees of origin, in Italy, which certify the electricity produced by renewable sources, but rather to invest in 
energy efficiency measures which concerned the network infrastructure and company off ices. This explains the significant 
percentage changes in electricity consumption from renewable and mixed sources compared to 2015.  
The self -generation of electricity, through co- generation and tri -generation systems, was lower in 2017 compared to 2016. 
During 2017, a series of maintenance activities were carried out and the contract to run operational plants  was reviewed. 
Therefore, a self -generation growth is expected  in the coming years. Furthermore, in the context of medium/small fixed 
network exchanges not included in the decommissioning plan, a project is being considered that provides for micro co -
generation solutions (50 -100 kW) to increase the degree of energy independence (less electrical energy taken from the grid 
against an increase in the cons umption of gas for industrial use). Cogeneration and trigeneration systems use around 30% less 
energy than traditional electricity generation systems, and play a by no means negligible role for TIM, particularly in indus trial 
sites, in data processing cent res (DPCs), which have notable energy requirements and high heating/cooling requirements.  
[GRI 302 -4] The energy efficiency of TIM in Italy has been recognised by the assignment of Energy Efficiency Certificates1, 
otherwise known as “white certificates”: b y the end of 2017, the total number of projects approved had reached 47. The 
certificates certify the achievement of energy savings in the final use of energy through measures to increase virtuous energ y 
efficiency as the performance is better than the nat ional average. The overall value of the EECs obtained since the start of the 
period amounts to around 47 million euros.  
In 2017, TIM Brasil significantly increased its use of electricity from renewable sources. In fact, the company, has rented 5  
hydroelectric plants with a capacity of around 1 MW each, which in December began to meet the energy demands of 1,234 
sites, producing around 3,162,000 kWh. These are in addition to the 40 currently operational solar panel plants (7 more than in 
2016) whic h produced around 134,500 GWh in 2017.  
                                                                    
1 One Energy Efficiency Certificate corresponds to 1 Ton of Oil Equivalent (TOE) saved, and its economic value is negotiable. 1 TOE is equivalent to 5,347 
kWh of electrici ty drawn from the mains network

Eco-efficiency indicator  
[GRI 302 -3] The Group measures its energy efficiency by using an eco -efficiency indicator that establishes a relationship 
between the service offered to the customer (bits transmitted) and the  company’s impact on the environment (joules of energy 
consumed). The factors taken into consideration are the amounts of data and voice traffic of the fixed and mobile networks, 
and energy consumption for industrial purposes (transmission and climate cont rol in exchanges), domestic purposes (electricity 
for office use, air conditioning and office heating) and vehicles.  
The diagrams show the level of the eco -efficiency indicator over the past three years for the Domestic and Brazil BU.  
Eco- efficiency 
BU Domestic  BU Brasile 
 
In 2017 the value of the indicator calculated for the Domestic BU was 9,022 bit/joule, up by 38% compared to 2016 and by 91 % 
compared to 2015. The commitment continues with the established for 2018 of an objective of 12.000 bit/Joul e, an increase of 
+33% on the figure  for 2017 (see 2018 Objectives in the Appendix).  
The eco- efficiency index calculated for Brazil continues to improve: in 2017 it grew by around 8.8% compared to 2016 and by 
over 16 % compared to 2015.  This is the result of a substantial increase in data traffic, which, thanks to the efficiency of the 
network, has not led to a corresponding increase in electricity consumption.  
The values of the indicators calculated respectively for Italy and Brazil are not directly comparable  because the two 
organisations are very different in operational and environmental terms: e.g. in Brazil the traffic is primarily mobile and, as 
previously mentioned, no heating fuels are used in view of the par ticular climate conditions.

Atmospheric emissions  
[GRI 305 -1] [GRI 305 -2] [GRI 305 -3] [GRI 305 -5] [GRI 305 -6] The Group’s greenhouse gas emissions consist almost 
exclusively of carbon dioxide generated by fossil fuels for heating, transport, power generation and the purchase of electricity 
from third parties , staff travel (service/maintenance activities, business trips and commuting from home to work).  
In addition to these, fugitive emissions i.e. hydroch lorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs and HFCs) and other gases 
from air conditioning systems are also considered and converted into kg of CO 2 equivalent.  
For atmospheric emissions as well, use is made of the GHG Protocol approach, distinguishing be tween direct or Scope1 
emissions (use of fossil fuels for transport, heating, power generation and fugitive emissions), indirect or Scope2 emissions  
(purchase of electricity for industrial and civil use) and other indirect or Scope3 emissions. Unless other wise stated, the 
atmospheric emission figures given here have been calculated based on the updated coefficients made available by the GHG 
Protocol1. 
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx)  emissions [GRI 305 -7] are negligible .

(*)The equivalent CO2 emissions of the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and other refrigerant gases ar e determined by  
reference to specific Global Warming Potential (GWP) coefficients for all gases types: the index is based on a rel ative scale that compares the gas 
considered with an equal mass of carbon dioxide with a GWP of 1. In Italy the GWP of HCFC used was 1,780 and that of HFC was 1,300. This year fugitive 
emissions from TIM Brasil’s systems were also taken into account, and i ncluded in the comparison with the previous two years

published by the GHG Protocol (2009) which considers the national energy mix, and is equal to 386 grams of CO2/kWh. For Brazi l, the average coefficients 
for 2015, 2016 and 2017 have been used, as calculated and published by the Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações e Comunicações (Ministry of

(**) In determining the impact of home -work commuting, reference is made to statistical data produced on the c ompany's personnel   
(***) Emissions due to air travel were calculated by the study and research centre of American Express (the Travel Agency used by TIM) supported by 
DEFRA (Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom) based on the number of   journeys actually made,  subdivided by the 
duration of each individual journey (short, medium or long) (****)  The calculation of the emissions for train journeys relates to Italy, and for S.p.A. only, and was taken from reports by Life Gate (used solely to 
determine Rail CO
2). The  emission factors refer to means of transport designed to transport passengers and derive from two main sources: 1. Yearly 
Report on environmental emissions associated with transport calculated annually by the National Institute for Environmental P rotectio n and Research 
(Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale - ISPRA); 2. Ecoinvent Database version 2.2; the emission factors were calculated using the 
characterization factors issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  in 2007. The same approach was used to calculate the 
emissions from hotel stays and use of rental vehicles.  
 
The emissions produced by the purchase of electricity from mixed (Scope2) sources increased significantly in 2017 and 2016, 
compared to 2015, due to the decision not to invest in purchasing guarantees of origin, which certify the electricity produced by 
renewable sources (unlike what occurred in Italy in 2014 and 2015), but rather in energy efficiency measures which concerned 
the network infrastruct ure and company offices.  Compared to 2016, the emissions produced in 2017 decreased by 9%.   
[GRI 305 -4] TIM measures  the “ Carbon Intensity ” of its Domestic BU1 also by using an indicator that establishes a relationship 
between the company’s direct and ind irect operational CO 2 emissions (Scope1 and Scope2), measured in kg, with the service 
offered to the customers in terms of Tbit s transmitted.

The factors taken into considerations are the amount of data and voice traffic of the fixed/mobile network and di rect emissions 
produced by using fossil fuels for heating, vehicles and self -production of electrical energy, and indirect emissions due to 
purchase and consumption of electrical energy from grid.  
The value of the indicator decreased significantly in 201 7: -28% compared to  2016. However, it is much higher than  in 2015 
(+214%) . This is due to the decision taken in 2016 not to invest, in Italy, in acquiring guarantees of origin, which certify the 
electricity produced by renewable sources . Therefore, the emiss ions produced by purchasing electricity from mixed sources 
(Scope2) increased significantly in 2016 compared to the two previous years.  
The traffic transmitted has also increased significantly in 201 7: + 24% compared to 201 6 and +69% compared to 201 5.

Purchases of paper for office and commercial use (telephone bills) continue to be directed at product types that meet the 
highest environmental standards based on the responsible management of forests according to the Forest Stewardship Council 
(FSC)1 requirements.  
The reduction in paper consumption for office use shown in the following table is in line with a historical trend resulting from 
work done to raise awareness among employees about the responsible use of paper in the workplace and rationalisation of energy use through the “printi ng on demand” project: shared high -performance printers and printing methods that save energy 
and consumables. Furthermore, in 2015, TIM signed up to the Olivetti Cloud Printing project, renewing its printers to optimis e 
and cut the cost of printing proces ses. The new printing equipment has high energy efficiency and reduced environmental 
impact.  Activities continued with the aim of achieving overall reductions in the use of paper for business purposes, including the 
promotion among customers of 
electronic invoices and statements . Furthermore, starting from the June 2017 billing cycle, with 
the introduction of new billing procedures, the frequency with which consumer bills are issued has been changed from monthly 
to a “bi -period of 56 days” (the billing peri od is now 28 days). The final data therefore records the reduction in volumes sent as 
of June.

2 By “waste consigned” is meant waste delivered to carriers for recycling or reclamation or disposal. 
3 Slight variations compared to the situation on December 31 may occur until the following March 30, because the source of the data is the records of 
waste loaded and unloaded, which are consolidated once the actual weight at destination has been verified. The information is  supplied to the producer 
of the waste within 3 months of consignment, which is the reason for the potential variations in the  data.  In this regard, the production ascertained for 
2016 is higher (+ 8%) than stated in the last Report. However, this increase was not  taken into account in the 2017 on 2016 comparison of waste produced

Waste data vary over time according to the quantities and types of waste. The most important item of data is the ratio 
between waste produced and delivered for recycling/recovery, which reached a significant level.  
ICT can accelerate the obsolescence of products and require the resulting technological waste to be managed. TIM has entered 
into contracts with companies specialised in handling used, faulty and end -of-life products, with the aim of reclaiming 
components and raw materials and at the same time obtaining tangible economic benefits deriving from their recovery.  
In 2017 the various management activities allowed logistics and network products (39,530 items) and commercial logistics products (126,400 items) to be regenerated, components and raw materials ( 189,000 kg in total, almost exclusively fixed 
telephony parts) to be sent for recovery. In 2017 TIM did not re -sell used mobile telephony items.  
In 
Brazil , TIM collects and manages mobile terminals, batteries and accessories at its shops through the Recarregue o Planeta 
(Recharge the Planet) programme. In 2017, a total of 821 kg was collected and sent for recovery/recycling or disposed of in compliance with current legislation. These activities have a dual purpose: contributing to a reduction in Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) produced while at the same time generating a financial benefit resulting from the difference 
between the cost that would be incurred for the pu rchase of new equipment and the cost of regeneration.  
 
Electromagnetic emissions 
The actions of the TIM Group on the subject of electromagnetic emissions are essentially  
•  careful management of its equipment during its entire life cycle and in compliance wit h current regulations and internal 
standards of efficiency and safety;  
•  in designing and optimising the radio access network, guaranteeing that serious attention is paid to the issue of 
electromagnetic emissions at every stage of the equipment life cycle;  
•  use of, and constant research into, the latest technological instruments for checks and controls.  
Systematic monitoring of the levels of electromagnetic emissions in installations aims to ensure that legal limits are respec ted 
and high safety standards are maintained for workers and the general population. Despite Italian regulations on 
electromagnetic emissions being among the strictest in the world, with levels set much lower than the European average, 
checks carried out in Italy have shown that electromag netic emissions generated are within the legal limits.  
TIM is investing in the development of accurate predictive software for electromagnetic forecasting, which is evolving and 
allowing the analysis of new technologies (currently 4.5G and 5G). In particu lar, the GUARDIAN tool calculates the level of 
exposure of sites that host aerials and ensures that the levels established by law are respected. Combined with the TIMplan design platform, its use allows the location of sites and orientation of the aerials in relation to a specific context (housing, roads, 
meeting places) to be optimised. TIM also participates actively in the committees and working groups of the CEI (Italian 
Electrotechnical Committee) for issuing guidelines and technical standards on method s used to measure and forecast levels of 
exposure to electromagnetic fields issued by mobile radio systems.
 
Accurate planning and optimisation of the mobile radio network (optimum choice of sites, optimum use of radio transmission 
parameters) improves the efficiency of the network for the same amount of coverage, maximising the capacity and quality of 
the service and minimising interference, thus contributing to reducing the power transmitted by mobile terminals and radio base stations.

In 2017, in particular, the following activities continued:  
!!support and training for local organisations in Electromagnetic Impact Analysis (EIA) activities;  
!!release and evolution of software tools developed internally to predict exposure (GUARDIAN);  
!!development and maintenance of the ARPIE web application for assessing the average power transmitted by radio base 
stations of 2G, 3G and 4G system in accordance with the legal changes introduced by Italian Legislative Decree 179/2012 
“Additional urgent measures for the g rowth of the Country” and its Implementation Guidelines.  
The APOGEO procedure has been applied to mobile radio systems allowing TIM to ensure that its systems are built in full compliance with the design, which in turn is fully compliant with legal requirements for protecting the health of the population. 
APOGEO is a TIM patent that uses high precision topographic and satellite instruments for 3D surveying of all radiating GSM, 
UMTS, LTE and Radio link systems and their infrastructure.  
In 
Brazil the non- ionising radiation emitted by the radio base stations of TIM Brasil are fully within the parameters dictated by 
the World Health Organization and adopted by the Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (ANATEL). All the radio base stations of TIM Brasil have a li cense to operate issued by ANATEL.

COMMUNITY  
[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach] [GRI 413] With its networks, products and technological solutions, TIM is one of the 
main protagonists of the evolution towards a digital economy and, given its size, reach, infrastructure and technological ass ets, 
is fully integrated with the area of operation and the social, economic and production context. TIM is aware of this strategic role 
and therefore works constantly to manage and innovate its infrastructure and technologies, which it places at the service of the 
country and to which end it makes significant investments.  
The Group companies intend to contribute to the economic wellbeing and growth of communities in which they operate by 
delivering increasingly digitalised services. Consistently with this objective and with its responsibilities towards the vari ous 
stakeholders, including the competitors listed in the sustainability section of the www.telecomitalia.com , the Group considers 
research and innovation to be essential conditions for growth and success.  
As private entities requiring co st-effective management, Group companies take the social impact of telecommunications 
services into account in their decision -making activities, responding to the needs of the Community, including the weakest 
members of society.  
The Group looks favourably  upon and, where appropriate, supports social, cultural and educational initiatives aimed at the 
enhancement of the individual and the improvement of their living conditions. The mission of the Fondazione TIM (FTIM)  is to 
promote the culture of digital cha nge and innovation, promoting integration, communication, economic and social growth.   The 
investment strategy implemented by TIM  Participações aims to promote the social inclusion of disadvantaged groups in 
Brazilian society, particularly children and teenagers, by running education programmes in the fields of science, technology and 
innovation.  With this spirit, in 2013 was founde d the Insituto TIM.  
 
MACRO AREAS OF INTERVENTION  PROJECT IDENTIFICATION  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  
The two main areas of intervention as 
regards investment in the community are the following:  
•  voluntary activities consistent with the Group's core business, 
associated with the provision of ICT 
services and digital content;  
•  activities aimed at the general development of the community 
mainly including the activities of the 
Fondazione TIM.  TIM identifies the projects to be 
implemented by the following means:  
•  consultation with the stakeholders 
and direct contact with civil society organisations;  
•  partnership projects with 
stakeholders and associations;  
•  benchmarking against other TLC 
operators;  
•  involvement in industry associations;  
•  knowledge of problems sector; 
•  external lobbying in response to 
social emergencies (e.g. 
earthquakes).  Each project is implemented in 4 stages:  
•  planning;  
•  selection;  
•  management;  
•  controls.    TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
THE VALUE CHAIN

Security and Crisis Management  
TIM has signed and is implementing the following agreements in  order to ensure maximum collaboration with the institutions in 
the safety field (particularly as regards Crisis Management):  
•  the “memorandum of understanding between the Department of Civil Protection of the Presidency of the Council of 
Ministers and the providers of electronic communication services to allow emergency information to be sent across national 
geographical areas” via SMS;  
•  the agreement between the crisis unit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and the operators of 
electronic communication services for the provision of services which allow messages to be sent to Italians abroad in 
emergency situations”;  
•  the “contract for the supply of information on the location of SIM cards used in Telecom Italia phones” with the national 
mountain and cave rescue corps to locate people lost in the mountains.  
In 2017, as required by the relevant laws on training, TIM took part in five national drills run by the Civil Protection Depa rtment in 
cooperation with the Presidency of the Co uncil of Ministers - Civil Protection Department and other relevant institutional bodies, 
aimed at:  
•  test the soundness of the emergency planning and ability to respond of the operational structures;  
•  maintain staff, structures and tools of the emergency management system in a state of readiness;  
•  identify, where necessary, actions to improve internal company processes and the processes used to interface with the 
relevant stakeholders (institutions, communities, customers).  
TIM’s involvement in these drills  is necessary as the company delivers essential services and is part of the National Civil 
Protection System together with other public and private member organisations.  
During the emergencies in 2017, TIM ensured its presence in the crisis units set up to deliver the services required after the 
following events:  
•  earthquakes in Abruzzo, Lazio, Marche, Umbria in August 2016 and January 2017;  
•  snowfall emergency in central Italy in January;  
•  summer fires in Lazio, Campania, Calabria, Apulia and Sicily;  
•  weat her events in Livorno, Pisa and Rome in September.  
 
Relations with local communities  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 413 ] In addition to the usual relations with national institutions, as described in the 
sustainability section of the www.telecomitalia.com  website, TIM works every day to ensure that relations with regional and 
local bodies are lasting and satisfactory, believing that this is the only way to create appropriate conditions for the devel opment 
of its area of operation and improve people’s quality of life, while allowing the institutions and TIM to achieve their respe ctive 
objectives.  
   TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
THE VALUE CHAIN

TIM’s objective is to spread technological innovation throughout the Country through the construction of f ixed and mobile 
ultrabroadband networks, as well as to digitise the operational processes of public and private organizations in the convicti on 
that this undertaking will generate the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of the Country.  
A central depar tment within TIM is dedicated entirely to managing re lations with local institutions, that  also relies on local 
authority accounts who are specialised in managing institutional relations on technical matters related to the development of  
fixed and mobile networks.  
The Relations with Local Authorities department, as part of its duties:  
•  carries out all possible actions of an institutional nature aimed at facilitating the development of the telecommunications 
network;  
•  identifies the intervention priorities of the other company departments through the Field Integration Committees1;  
•  establishes the  priorities and determines how to interact with public bodies in light of the requirements identified;  
•  constantly monitors existing institutional relations and systematically develops the network of relationships;  
•  contributes to drawing up agreements with  regions and municipalities;  
•  listens systematically to all requests and reports from local institutions and directs them correctly to the relevant 
departments within TIM;  
•  supports other departments of TIM in the implementation of territorial projects;  
•  prev ents disputes arising, above all in reference to network development issues.  
Particular attention is paid to organizations that deal with issues relating to:  
•  the development of fixed and mobile ultrabroadband networks;  
•  digitalisation of public utility services;  
•  use of public funds;  
•  the spread of digital culture.  
TIM responds flexibly to requests, regardless of how they are received.  
Joint projects between TIM and local authorities are managed in a way that define the roles and duties of each party, for mal 
control mechanisms and measurement tools. TIM promotes the formation of joint control committees, i.e. committees formed 
of representatives of all the parties involved. The composition and objectives of the committees are determined according to the sp ecific requirements of the project and provide for the presence of stakeholders without any kind of discrimination, in 
particular without gender discrimination.  
Monitoring and constant interaction with the decision -making centres of local institutions take  place by means of meetings, 
hearings, including the presentation of position documents and involvement in workshops as well as in the work of regional 
commissions and specialist working groups . TIM frequently organises communication initiatives on specifi c issues of local 
interest. 
[GRI 413 -1] Given the ubiquity of its network, the Group has relations with local authorities in all regions where it operates and 
always assesses the impacts of its operations and development plans, regardless of the type of in tervention, which in any case 
is always carried out in full compliance with current legislation and with the needs of local communities.

73 
Among the main subjects of dialogue with local authorities during 2017 we would highlight the following:  
•  the develop ment of new super -fast broadband networks, territorial coverage and reduction of the digital divide;  
•  actions of an institutional nature involving local administrations aimed at encouraging development of the fixed and mobile 
telecommunications network;  
•  the drawing -up of protocols with local authorities in order to develop new generation access networks;  
•  draft regional laws and municipal regulations regarding the installation of mobile telephony systems and electromagnetic fields, in order to represent the c ompany's requirements in a way that allows all the various interests involved to coexist, 
with a view to simplifying rules and standardising the relevant national provisions;  
•  proposed excavation rules, in order to ensure the consistency of the authorisati on process and the respective regulations 
with the relevant national regulations, particularly in order to ensure increased simplification at local level;  
•  the removal of public telephone equipment (telephone booths), which involved public consultation;  
•  the promotion of digital transformation initiatives to facilitate the dissemination and learning of new technologies by 
seeking forms of partnership with municipalities;  
•  the dissemination of digital innovation and culture, particularly by promoting agreement s, protocols and partnerships with 
local government offices;  
•  promotion of the digital solutions and services system for the creation of smart cities;  
•  the drawing up of 20 regional policy reports aimed at taking stock of the current situation and the develo pment of regional 
policies regarding digital services, network infrastructure, the digital agenda and smart cities in light of the new EU funds  
programming policy for 2014 -2020;  
•  the central and regional management, coordination and monitoring of complaints  received by local institutions, through the 
internal Digital Development Project amongst other means.  
[GRI 413 -2] The potential negative impacts arising exclusively from excavations for installing cable ducts or positioning radio 
base stations, are mitiga ted through the use of low environmental impact technologies, such as mini -trenches, and thanks to 
prior agreements with local authorities, e.g. regarding aerial installation sites.

How the contribution to the Community is measured  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 413]  The contribution made to the community by the Group, calculated according 
to the London Benchmarking Group (LBG)1 guidelines, amounted to 17.4 million euros in 2017. The contribution has been 
calculated using management data partly based on estimates. 2015 and 2016 data are available in TIM web site, sustainability

  Initiatives consistent with the core business  
Fund raising 
In a national and international context in which crisis and conflict scenarios multipl y, against an ever -increasing number of 
subjects in need and emergency situations, private fund -raising is a key factor in the cohesion and support “from person to 
person”. For over ten years, TIM has been a key player in the solidarity chain associated with humanitarian, scientific or 
environmental projects which it supports by allowing people to make a donation of 1 or 2 euros by sending a text message and 
of 2, 5 or 10 euros by calling a dedicated free number from a land line. Of the 100 numbers intended  for the voluntary sector, of 
which 2 are for emergencies, 60 are currently configured and available, and shared with other operators.  
The amounts collected are returned in full, with no withholdings applied by either the tax authority or the Company for t he 
costs incurred.  
                                                                    
1 More than 150 major international companies subscribe to the LBG, which was founded in 1994 and is the global gold standard for the classification of 
voluntary contributions made by companies in favour of the communit y. In accordance with the LBG model, in order to measure and represent the 
Group's commitment to the community, the contributions disbursed have been subdivided into three categories (Charity, Investm ents in the community, 
Initiatives in the community), adopting the customary pyramid -shaped representation, which places initiatives of a charitable nature at the top and 
initiatives which in addition to being of benefit to the community are in the commercial interest of the Company at the botto m. For further i nformation 
regarding the LBG model and its investment classification criteria on the 3 levels, see the lbg -online.net website  and the sustainability section of the

124 campaigns were launched in 2017, which raised over 11 million euros. The largest amounts of money are raised for medical 
and scientific initiatives, with social welfare initiatives close behind. A breakdown of the funds raised is giv en below.  
 
 
 
It is also worth mentioning that, in addition to the funds raised in the traditional way by telephone, funds were raised for the 
people affected by the earthquake in Umbria using the WithYouWeDo crowdfunding platform to support the “Un aiuto  subito” 
initiative.  
 
 
 
Digital Culture Projects   
In a coordinated and complementary manner with respect to the  Country's technological infrastructure path, the TIM Group 
aims to improve the digital literacy of the population and enhance excellence in the Country via the potential offered by the 
internet.   
Digital skills have a crucial role to play in our society and have been one of the key factors in allowing economies to achieve a 
competitive advantage over the past twenty years, as shown by much of the  work carried out by the OECD or promoted by the 
European Commission. In this respect as well, the Digital Agenda asks Member States to take action to broaden knowledge of 
digital tools and increase the number of people with evolved digital skills, particu larly by disseminating ICT technologies in 
schools. In this context, schools must make a radical change in the way they plan and provide education, and in the way pupils, 
teaches and parents relate to one another. Because of the importance of this subject,  the European Commission constantly 
monitors the speed with which digital technologies are being introduced in schools and in teaching processes.

Since 2015, TIM has participated as Founding Sponsor partner, now Benefactor, in Programma il Futuro  (Programme the Future), 
a MIUR initiative that favours the introduction of coding and computational thinking in the educational programmes of schools  
of all levels. The project is implemented by CINI (Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale per l’Informati ca) and TIM supports all its 
activities in different ways: financial support, technological support via the crowdfunding platform, communication and busin ess 
volunteering.  
 
Furthermore, since the 2016/2017 academic year, TIM has been running the Using ICT  in schools, with TIM  project in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) to familiarise teachers with the digital world  and 
its tools, in order to offer them an all -encompassing vision of the technological application s that add value and new 
opportunities to the teaching profession. This is a two -year project that involves teachers from schools of all types and levels in 
18 Italian regions. The project involved around 3 ,350 teachers in 2017.  
 Internet safety is promoted by the 
Navigare Sicuri  (Safe Surfing) project, an app available for iOS and Android, which is divided 
into 3 macro areas: a children's section, which aims to make younger children (target ages 8 -12) aware of digital risks and, in 
particular, convey the ten rules to follow when using the internet in a playful and captivating way; a section for parents, a imed 
at making them aware of the dangers of the web based on the FO SI (Family Safety Online Institute) recommendations and a 
section for teachers, which provides educational tips on internet safety -related matters.  
WithYouWeDo is the crowdfunding platform that promotes and supports the funding of digital initiatives, ideas and projects in 
the fields of social innovation, digital culture and environmental protection, while at the same time aiming to facilitate the match between the supply of funds to demand from both individual citizens and companies and/or institutions in the profit - and 
non- profit world. In addition to providing acc ess to the technological platform, TIM undertakes to contribute to funding the most 
successful projects up to a maximum of 10,000 euros each.  Since the platform was launched at the beginning of 2015, until 
December 2017, over 700 projects have been receive d and 72 published, with 35 having achieved their financial target. In total, 
WithYouWeDo has raised over 1.9 million euros from over 4,000 donors for the projects published.  
Social innovation is also the main feature of the second series of Start! , a five -part television programme broadcast on Rai2. 
Following the success of the first season, the second series will focus on how digital technology, networks and platforms can  
contribute to societal development, particularly in terms of creating social value.  
TIM also provides 
Dynamo Camp , which every year hosts 200 families, 1 ,200 young people between 6 and 17 years old affected 
by serious diseases, with some of its resources (technology, physical spaces, project management and human resources), for free, for the project to relaunch 
Radio Dynamo , a web radio ( radiodynamo.org ) which is one of the most well -loved 
entertainment activities at the camp, as well as one of the main activities of the Outreach programme, i.e. Dynamo outside the 
camp, which every year allows many young people to be reached who for various reasons cannot attend the camp. Since February 2017, the studio and editorial office of Radio Dynamo have been housed at the TIM offices in Piazza Einaudi , Milan.  
 
The commitment of Fondazione TIM   
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 413] The TIM Group companies are particularly attentive to the needs of the 
Community in which they operate and implement wide -ranging initiatives and projects dedicated to their social and economic 
development. The mission of the Fondazione TIM (FTIM) is to promote the culture of digital change and innovation, promoting 
integration, communication, economic and social growth.  FTIM can operate, in Italy and abroad, by the methods and with the 
tools that are considered appropriate in each case for it to achieve its statutory purposes.  
In accordance with this mission, four areas of intervention have been identified:    TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
THE VALUE CHAIN  
 
  
77 
•  Education : innovation in teaching and education, promoting initi atives aimed at updating the technology in Italian schools 
and introducing radical innovations in educational methods and tools.  
•  Innovation Culture : a programme of unconventional activities in the world of foundations for the purpose of promoting a 
culture  of innovation and becoming a point of reference for this.  
•  Social Empowerment : non- profit -making  organisations, are businesses. FTIM promotes both the better use of technologies 
and improved management and efficiency to help the organisations “do good well”.  
•  Historic and Artistic Heritage : Italian artistic heritage represents excellence in the “technology of the pa st”. F TIM wants to 
contribute to its enhancement and public use through present -day technology.  
FTIM's activities take place according to the following criteria.  
TOOLS  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES  PROJECT SELECTION AND 
MONITORING  
FTIM pursues its objectives by 
assigning contributions to projects 
put forward by third party individuals and non -profit 
institutions,
 according to 
requirements established by the 
Board of Directors.   
Since 2015, FTIM has also taken on an operational role, managing a number of projects  itself.
 FTIM works to disseminate a culture of 
innovation , in order to promote solidarity and 
civil, cultural and economic development.   
The foundation therefore undertakes to work 
for an increasingly digital, advanced and 
competitive Italy to improve living conditions 
for people.  
  This translates to innovative projects for the 
promotion and 
diffusion of science and 
technology , as well as the development of 
models, technological tools and systems to support non -profit associations.  
 The selection  is made based on the social 
impact of projects, which must be measurable, 
sustainable and replicable. Priority is given to those which, in line with the Group’s DNA, present a high technological, transformative 
and innovative content.  
The 
monitoring syste m is established 
according to the specific characteristics and 
objectives of each project.  Monitoring is a 
requirement for all projects, whether selected by tender or directly. As well as being an eligibility requirement, it also provides an assessment parameter.
 
 
In 2017, FTIM concent rated its resources on a number of important projects which allowed it to focus increasingly on 
technological innovation to improve the solutions identified and broaden the range of targets to achieve, with an exponential  
effect in terms of the impact on our national community.  
In the context of Innovation Culture , building on the Lezioni sul Progresso  - a theatrical experience by means of which FTIM  has 
developed a more engaging and fun way to talk to young people about science - a TV programme was produced called 
MeravigliosaMente , featuring 5 Italian centres of excellence. A n extraordinary journey in which Enrico Bertolino took viewers to 5 
different Italian cities to meet the best young minds designing our future in leadin g academic or research centres: Scuola 
Superiore Sant’Anna in Pisa, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genoa,  Università di Padova in Padua,  Università di Milano Bicocca 
in Milan, Politecnico di Torino in Turin. A journey through many fascinating subjects including robotics, neuroscience, innovative 
mobility, new materials, genetics, cybersecurity.  
Alongside the programme, a web platform was also launched at  meravigliosamente.org  which contains over 2 ,000 profiles of 
under -40s operating in the fields of science and technology in a wide range of potential specialisations.  A site where students,

In the area of Social Empowerment , FTIM remains committed to the field of dyslexia. On World Dyslexia Day , a wide -ranging 
digital communication campaign informed non -professionals about what dyslexia is and isn’t, aiding the overcoming of   TIM Sustainability Report 2017

stereotypes associated with this disorder. The campaign also improved the visibility of current projects in the field of healthc are 
- making early screening tools available free of charge - and education - to make schools ever more inclusive. 
 
In the field of Education , the collaboration continued between FTIM and Accademia della Scala, which is intended to enhance 
and promote the work of one of Italy’s centres of excellence and to innovate in the field of training, in order to hand down 
traditi onal and valuable trades; a transformation project which combines education in theatrical occupations with the most 
innovative technologies, supporting young talent and bringing young people closer to the opera world through:  
•  “Talenti On Stage”  (Talent On Stage), a crowdfunding campaign - in its second year - on the TIM  WithYouWeDo  
platform,  which has raised funds for the assignment of 171 scholarships (FTIM matched each euro donated to the 
Academmi a bringing the total amount raised to 200,000 euros ). 
•  “Innovazione On Stage”  (Innovation On Stage), a tour including the cities of Milan, Bari, Turin and Palermo which has 
allowed visitors, particularly thanks to an immersion experience, to enter the heart  of the stage and find out about the world 
of the Academmia and its training offers.  
As part of its commitment to the  enhancement of historical and artistic heritage , FTIM signed an agreement with the 
Municipality of Rome on December 2015 which provides f unding of 6 million euros for the restoration of the Mausoleum of 
Augustus  - an impressive funerary monument dating from the first century BC, which, with its diameter of 300 Roman feet 
(about 87 meters), is the largest known circular tomb in the world. In  addition to the agreement for the restoration, another 
agreement was signed for the enhancement and multimedia activities, again with the municipality, but implemented directly by FTIM, which will spend 2 million euros.  
 
Work is expected to be complete by March 2019. Full details of the project can be found on the 
http://www.mausoleodiaugusto.it/  website, which has received many national and international awards.  
 
It is important finally to mention Fonda zione TIM
 #Italiax10 , the tender launched by FTIM for initiatives taken by non- profit -
making organisations and sponsored by the Group’s employees, which this year was dedicated to projects to regenerate the 
areas of central Italy affected by the earthquake  in 2016.  
The initiative, which ended with a very exciting day of celebration of the 10 finalist projects, will culminate in the winner  being 
announced during the first meeting of the Board of Directors next year.  
 
Instituto TIM   
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 413] In 2013, the TIM Institute was founded with the aim of defining strategies and 
providing resources for the dissemination of science and innovation to support the development of the community in Brazil, 
particularl y by means of mobile technology.  
Four areas of activity were identified in which to develop projects:

O	  Círculo	  da	  Matemática	  do	  Brasil	  (Brazilian	  Math	  Circle) 	  
One of the greatest obstacles to scientific and technological progress in Brazil is the poor standard of maths teaching in sc hools. 
According to the Ministry of Education, only 42% of students in the third year of primary school can do simply arithmetic li ke 
addition and subtraction. In the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012, based on the results achieved in  
maths by its students, Brazil came 58th on a list of 65 countries. By focusing attention on the first few years of primary scho ol, 
the O Círculo da Matemática do Brasil  project, working with its founders, professors Bob and Ellen Kaplan of Harvard University, 
introduces the Math Circle approach to the Country, perfecting and adapting its content to the Brazilian context. The proje ct 
began in 2013, by training 50 teachers selected from public schools throughout the Country. The teachers attended a training 
workshop with Bob and Ellen Kaplan and learned to replicate the Math Circle approach in class with their own students.  The 
impac t assessment conducted at the end of the year showed that children who took part in the project improved their maths 
skills by 7.3% on average. In 2015, 12 cities and 5,548 students were involved in the project, and still are. Around June, 50 
teachers bega n to take an active part in this training process, replicating the approach and taking responsibility for training a 
further 2,146 teachers. This will allow more than 75,000 students in 20 Brazilian cities to enjoy the fruits of the teaching method. 
In 201 6, the project continued with a further 50 teachers who completed the training process in April, becoming responsible for a 
further 1,800 teachers in another 20 cities.  At the beginning of 2017, teachers in Timon and Porto Velho completed the training 
that began in 2016, bringing the fourth year of the project to a close. By the end of May 2017, all the teachers who were trained 
in 2016 received their certificates.  
  
TIM	  Faz	  Ciência	  (TIM	  Does	  Science)	  
The results achieved by Brazilian students in science ar e far from ideal. The PISA (Programme for International Student 
Assessment) science test conducted in 2012 placed Brazil in 59th place on a list of 65 countries. Out of the three areas asse ssed 
- reading, maths and science - the last was the one in which B razilian students achieved the least satisfying results. However, 
during the 2014 academic year more than 2,000 teachers in public schools nationwide were able to introduce a more interesting  
approach in science lessons.   In the second half of 2013, Instit uto TIM launched TIM Faz Ciência  (TIM Does Science): an 
educational activity aimed at teaches and students in the 4th ad 5th years of primary school.  The project is intended to develop 
a set of resources aimed at providing guidance to teachers in teaching the foundations of scientific thought to children. The  
content explores the notions of definition, observation, formulating questions and assumptions,  classification, verification, 
application and generalisation. Overall, in 2014, 70,000 students were invited to explore scientific notions and concepts in a 
more pleasant and effective way. In 2015, the programme involved over 125,000 students and 4,000 teachers and was adopted   TIM Sustainability Report 2017

by 6 cities as a local training project, while in 2016, student numbers increased to 136,764 and teachers to 4,731 in 115 cit ies 
around the country.  During the first half of 2017, the teachers who attended training in 2016 received their certificates.

One of the Brazilian government’s priorities is to increase the availability of professional and technological education cour ses. In 
2011, the government launched PRONATEC - National Programme for Access to Technical Education and Employment – on 
which 6 million people are currently enrolled. One of the initiatives of PRONATEC is the e -TecBrasil Network, which provides free 
technical and distance learning courses. !
TIM Tec is a distance learning platform that uses the MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) concept. These courses, which are 
provided and made available for free on the platform, are intended for students attending high schools and technical colleges . 
Anyone can enrol on the courses, which teach programming languages and  how to create databases, websites, games and 
many other things. There are also courses for primary school teachers and others intended to improve the skills considered to  
be basic for the training of any professional, such as how to write well.  
The technology and content of the TIM Tec platform are share with Federal Institutes of Education, Science and Technology, 
with the support of the Department of Vocational and Technological Education of the Ministry of Education (SETEC/MEC).  
The TIM Institute suppor ts the Federal Institutes in the process of installing and using the platform.  
As of December 2017, the platform had 28 courses available with over 55,000 registered students, By the first half of 2018, a  
further 2 courses will be made available.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  
In Italy   
[GRI  103- 1: Management Approach]  [GRI 203]  Innovation understood as a research and development activity for innovative 
technologies and services, processes and business models represents a key factor in the company’s ability to keep up with the  
profound transformations brought about through ICT, as well as a necessary asset acting as a driving force in this evolution in 
terms of its customers (both residential and business) and the national system, helping to overcome the socio- cultural barriers 
that limit the opportunity to participate in the information society and enjoyment of the relative benefits.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 203]  TIM has always considered innovation to be a strategic asset and takes great 
care in governing individual aspects, fro m its strategic role to responsibility, objectives and policy. 
In terms of role, both technological and business -based innovation are also confirmed in 2017 as the central element to the 
response to change in the technological, market and competitive conte xt. In line with this, the Group has taken action in several 
ways:  
•  by continuing the action, started in 2016, to strengthen internal innovation lines, focusing laboratory activities and resear ch 
groups on key aspects of the development of the fixed and mob ile network towards future 5G standards and 
ultrabroadband, and issues concerning service platforms and new operations systems;  
•  by confirming the lean towards the “Open Innovation” principle with the aim of maximising the benefits deriving from the 
integra tion of innovative contributions generated internally with extern al sources of innovative ideas;  
•  by interacting  with the start -up world in order to catalyse the latter's capacity for innovation  through the TIM #Wcap 
acceleration programme and equity inves tments through TIM Venture. In 2017, TIM #Wcap launched a Call for Start -ups and 
two Calls for Partners;  
•  by implementing initiatives which allow for the growth of co -creation ecosystems like the IoT Open Lab, a laboratory 
dedicated to the development of IoT solutions based on key technologies for the Telco Operator with a view to open 
innovation.   
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 203]  Innovation management is overseen, with different missions, by the 
Innovation Department and by engineers, but involve s various internal and external stakeholders of the company. In addition to 
the universities and vendors mentioned above, the following are highlighted:  
•  other areas of the Company involved from time to time (for example Marketing and Purchasing), both as i nternal customers 
for the innovation output solution and as centres of expertise on the topic;  
•  both traditional (e.g. car makers) and digital (e.g. e -commerce players) partners, for the joint go2market of digital services;  
•  research centres and universitie s, for cooperation and joint projects; [GRI 203 -1] In 2017, 22 research contracts came into 
effect, for a total value of 555,000 euros.  
•  [GRI 203 -1] standardisation bodies and associations: TIM is still very active within the main standardisation bodies and 
associations, with 30 memberships in 2017, for a cost of 840,000 euros.  On a national, but above all international, level the re 
is a broad circle made up of standardisation bodies (ETSI, ITU, CENELEC and 3GPP among others), associations (GSMA and NGMN  to name the major ones), alliances (such as oneM2m and BBF), and telco open communities (for example ONF, 
OPNFV and CORD), which play a fundamental role in the evolution of the TLC industry for networks, platforms and services. Then there are the Ministri es (Ministry of Economic Development and Ministry of Education, Universities and Research), the 
European Union and public authorities (e.g. CNR and local authorities) for projects funded through participation in 
competitive tenders, and partnership initiat ives.   TIM Sustainability Report 2017

The identification of themes around which projects are developed takes into account the Three -Year Technological Plan, the 
reference document for the Group, which provides guidelines for the evolution of the network, platform and services. Publishe d 
annually, following a wide -ranging process involving all the areas of the Company involved, the Plan identifies the main external 
factors (regulations, standards, vendors, other market operators) that may influence the Company's strategies and highlights 
the emerging and cross -cutting technologies in other sectors that may be of interest to the Group.  
The qualitative and/or quantitative objectives of each project may refer to a multi -year timeframe but they are in any case 
structured on an annual basis and defined so they can be objectively measured in compliance with standards concerning quality 
(ISO9001) and the environment (ISO14001) and the operational processes of innovation, just as in general TIM’s processes are 
based on the E -Tom reference standard of the TMF.  
[GRI 203 -1] Overall, in 2017 TIM committed around 1,300 human resources to working on technological innovation and 
engineering activities for an overall investment of 1,992 million of euros amounting to 13% of domestic revenues.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 203]  Activities	  for	  the	  future	  of	  mobility	  and	  networks:	  initiatives	  for	  5G 	  
5G allows for not only faster speeds than those possible with earlier technologies (therefore within the scope of eMBB – 
enhanced Mobile Broadband – applications), but also a multitude of services with very different requirements, in particular in the 
mMTC1 and URLLC2 areas.  
TIM has followed the development of 5G from the start (2012), actively participating in the definition of international standards as well  as European consortia and projects which laid the foundations for the system and contributed to the introduction of 
innovative use cases and applications. In particular, TIM participated in the European Horizon 2020 METIS and METIS II projec ts 
included in  the 5GPPP European initiative and in another 12 projects concerning all the main technological turning points of 5G, 
collaborating with the main providers of network technologies and terminals through specific MoUs.  
The operational activities for technological development and 5G trials are accompanied by structured technical communication ranging from publishing to promotion with events of a scientific scope. In particular, in 2017 the technical communication 
initiative “Special 5G” was accomplished throug h 5G day, a sharing event with representatives from institutions and the 
industrial world, in addition to academic research, aimed at promoting the business ecosystem for the development of 5G 
solutions. It was followed up by TIM’s 'Notiziario Tecnico' (Te chnical Newsletter) e -magazine
3 which dedicated two issues to 
describing and further exploring, network aspects and service aspects respectively enabled by 5G. Three important initiatives  
were launched in 2017 - Turin 5G, San Marino 5G and Bari -Matera 5G - to provide these municipalitie s with 5G radio mobile 
coverage.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI  203]   IoT	  Open	  Lab	   	  
In November 2016 TIM opened the IoT Open Lab, which became fully operational in 2017, at its base in Turin. Its purpose, 
according to the methods inherent in Open In novation, is to support the development of IoT solutions based on key 
technologies for the Telco Operator. In particular, the IoT Open Lab acts as a business accelerator to support companies in entering the ecosystem of technologies standardised by the 3GP P and, as regards the current period, Narrow Band IoT

construction companies have agreed a partnership with TIM allowing them to use what the Lab offers free of charge. 
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 203]   Research	  with	  Universities	   	  
The Open Innovation activities (understood as R&D participatory behaviour) for 2017 were largely concentrated on the new 
Innovation model pursued at TIM and guided by top management.  In line with this, faced with significantly lower polarisation on 
services, communities and creative innovation, the focus was placed on technological innovation aspects, with particular emphasis on opportunities deriving from 5G.  The new direction involved the resizing of the JOLs (closure of Pisa and Milan, 
resizing of Trento and Catania), and the activation in the “remaining” JOLs of projects with a strong technological approach:  
cognitive computing, 5G, applications in the netw ork sector, industrial IoT applications, the strengthening of pre -commercial 
initiatives associated with Open IoT Lab, above all to Olivetti's benefit.   
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 203 ]  Funded	  research	  activities	   	  
TIM has always actively participated in innovation and research projects and initiatives funded by the European Commission, 
which allowed it not only to obtain funding of around eight million euros in the three -year period 2015- 20171, but also to 
participate in initiatives with highly innovative content where it developed and consolidated its know -how in rapidly evolving 
sectors, thanks to collaboration with important European research centres, as well as North American, Korean and Japanese ones. In this context the activities performed  for the 5G projects funded should be highlighted which, together with the TIM 
Group’s undertakings in standardisation bodies and in the main international forums dealing with the evolution of mobile 
networks, has enabled it to enrich its range of skills, acquiring a role recognized at European level which now allows it to activate various 5G pilot projects in Italy well in advance of the expected timing.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 203]   Intellectual	  Property	  Rights. 	  
In addition to contributing to developments within the Company, TIM produces a significant number of patents: in the 2015 -2016 
period it filed over 120 patents. In order to maximize their value, a spin -up model was recently developed, that is the launch of 
start -ups that have received assets and the rights to use patents in exchange for equity options.  
[GRI 203 -1] In 2017, the Group's portfolio of patents had grown to include 25 new patents filed and several other proposals 
undergoing assessment. The patenting areas relate to the whole  ICT sector, with areas of excellence in the mobile sector. In 
more detail:  
•  3,136 patents owned by TIM as of November 2017 (of which 2,557 granted), relating to 609 patent categories;  
•  254 patents resulting from collaboration with universities and research institutes since the collaboration was launched 
(1997).  
Participation in a Patent Pool for LTE with a patent essential for the relative standard should also be noted. The Patent Poo l 
acquired new participants over the course of the year (bringing the curre nt total to 16 license -holders) and has granted several 
licences. Also note the participation in the 2017 Techshare Day where TIM and the Polytechnic of Turin  made a selection of 
patents and technologies available to Italian SMEs with the aim of expanding the assessment of the research results and 
developing relations with the industrial sector.

Research and Development in Brazil  
[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach]  [GRI 203]  [GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 203 ] The Innovation & 
Technology Department, headed by the CTO of TIM Brasil, is responsible for Research and Development (R&D) activities. Its 
main responsibilities are defining the technological innovation of the network, the evolutionary needs for new technologies a nd 
devices and the architectural guidelines together with the development of strategic partnerships, so as to exploit the new 
business models and guarantee the evolution of the network infrastructure in line with the business strategy. The organizatio nal 
structure of Innovation & Technolog y is currently made up of 28 people in the Networks area, including telecommunications 
engineers, electrics and electronics engineers, IT experts and other technicians of various origins, competences and experien ces, 
who cover all  innovative needs and pro vide support to R&D.  
In terms of infrastructure, one important result was the establishment of TIM Lab, a multi -purpose test environment focusing on 
innovation, which is able to guarantee the assessment of innovative services, products and technologies, ce rtifying their 
functional efficiency and performance and the development of new models and configurations, consolidating the innovation flow. TIM Lab plays a strategic role in providing support for the conduct of Credibility Test, Trials and Proof of Conce pt (POC), for 
the validation of the services in collaboration with the main suppliers of technology and partners, through the sharing of knowledge and the technological infrastructures for interoperability tests, the assessment of capacity and the definiti on of 
technical requirements; in synergy with the R&D department, it facilitates innovation and promotes collaborations with 
universities and research institutes.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 203]  In January 2017, a new TIM Lab Innovation Centre w as opened (at the 
Corporate Executive Offices complex) in Barra da Tijuca, in the state of Rio de Janeiro: a building with a surface area of 65 0 
square metres, able to accommodate more than 60 people. This new office could host technicians and researchers and be seen 
as a space of innovation open to new opportunities and the development of innovation for the Brazilian telecommunications 
market, also operating as a national reference point for R&D activities.  
In 2017, more than 180 validation and innovation projects were concluded. Moreover, new technological areas, such as transport 
and fixed access solutions, were included in the range of initiatives relating to innovation and R&D. In this regard, over 22  million 
reais were invested in this project in the 2 016/17 period, including the new lab premises, and, according to the 2018 -2020 
budget, additional investments worth 17 million reais are planned.  
The Innovation & Technology department has worked on projects and initiatives aiming to ensure the evolution o f the business 
of TIM Brasil through the recommendation of sustainable, efficient network platforms and “disruptive” models, including 
anticipating the availability of new services.  
These projects can be divided into five groups:  
•  New generation networks  
•  Future internet applications  
•  Positive environmental impacts 
•  Positive social impacts 
•  Open Lab initiatives

 [GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 203]  	  	  New	  generation	  network	  projects	   	  
The reassignment of the 1,800 MHz, 850 MHz and 2,100 MHz bandwidths  from 2G/3G to 4G, consisting of multilayer 
development, gives TIM Brasil three important competitive advantages:  
•  reduction of costs for LTE deployment;  
•  expansion of the LTE coverage area and activation of the Carrier Aggregation strategy, improving the customer experience 
through higher “throughputs”;  
•  improved indoor coverage. In addition to the expansion of coverage, use of the 850/ 1,800/2,100 MHz bandwidths  could 
increase the capacity in cities already covered by the LTE bandwidth at 2.6 GHz, at limited additional cost.  
Another important consideration in this scenario is that over 88% of current LTE terminals are already compatible with the 
1,800 MHz and 2,600 MHz bandwidths , and with the other bandwidths available; hence, implementation of the LTE mul tilayer is 
proving to be an excellent strategy that benefits from the dissemination of devices.  
•  The deployment of the LTE 700 MHz layer will result in significant expansion of the coverage and indoor penetration, 
promoting the presence of LTE throughout th e national territory and consolidating TIM Brasil’s leadership in LTE. The actual 
roll-out will follow the rules dictated by the EAD (Entidade Administradora de Processo de Redistribuição e Digitalização de 
Canais de TV e RTV) in order to manage the spectr um cleaning and avoid interference problems with the analogue TV 
transmission service. 78% of the LTE devices used by the current users of TIM Brasil services are enabled for the 700 MHz bandwidth.  
•  On 15 June 2016, TIM Brasil activated its first commercia l LTE 700 MHz network in the city of Rio Verde, which makes it one 
of the first operators to explore this frequency bandwidth in Brazil. At the end of 2017, over 830 cities could test the LTE 700 
MHz coverage.  
•  As part of the IP Multimedia Network Evolution , in 2015 three tests were conducted at the Innovation Lab to evaluate the 
IMS1 . In 2016 the tests were extended to live networks, allowing TIM Brasil to set up the functional infrastructure to provide 
services such as Voice over LTE (VoLTE), Video over LT E (ViLTE) and Wi -Fi Calling, entirely laid on IP and activated by an IMS 
platform. In July 2017 TIM launched VoLTE high definition voice call services on the market, providing call services without 
the need to pass through switched lines. At the end of 201 7, over 1,000 cities could use this service.  
•  As regards the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networks (SDN), some initiatives were launched, such as the creation of the “TIM Brasil NFV Program,” developed through four working gr oups (established on the 
basis of the logical domains and competencies of the NFV) which have a mandate to define technical requirements, infrastructural plans, roadmaps of the virtualised network functions (VNF), “open lab” specifications and reference 
architecture compliant with the ETSI standard on NFVs. The main drivers that push the adoption of these innovative network 
approaches are reduction of the CapEX/OpEx, faster time to market, optimization and boosting innovation.

•  The expansion of “4G RAN sharing”, in partnership with other Brazilian mobile operators, aims to define the architectural requirements, technical assumptions and specifications for the “LTE RAN sharing” solution, optimising the network resources and costs.  The costs of the infrastructures are mainly linked to the introduction of the new radiating system and 
that of other electronic devices, passive infrastructures and transport networks; therefore, the sharing of resources provide d 
by LTE RAN Sharing Soluti ons represents a significant optimisation of costs for operators. In this regard, TIM has pursued and 
considered RAN Sharing Solutions since 2007. Another strong motivation lies in coverage issues and timing in compliance

with regulatory requirements. Init ially, tests were conducted in a controlled environment at the Innovation Lab and 
thereafter an MOCN (Multiple Operator Core Network) solution was defined, standardised by 3GPP. A live pilot test was 
introduced in a second stage to assess other technical a spects. At present, this is the biggest RAN Sharing agreement to be 
reached worldwide and it allows the major Brazilian cities to use 4G services.  
•  The RAN Sharing agreement allows TIM to promote the evolution of LTE development in rural areas of Brazil, sharing access 
and backhaul effectively.  
•  At present 4G RAN Sharing relies on two national partners, improving the possible benefits and efficiencies of this technical  
model.  
•  Following continuous testing activities, they were tested and approved for the larg e-scale introduction of functionalities as 
well as savings and energy efficiency solutions, which primarily concern the low traffic periods for the 2G, 3G and 4G access  
layers. The energy consumption recorded for the site, dependent on the access technolog y and coverage conditions,

Digital inclusion  
Geographical digital inclusion  
 [GRI 103 -1: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  ] The spread of broadband and ultrabroadband networks represents a boost 
to the economic growth of Countries. The Group’s Business Plans have always highlighted the economic benefits linked to the 
development of technical infrastructure.   In particular, the fixed and mobile coverage targets for the three -year period 2017-
2019 can be viewed on the Group’s website at the following link:  
http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/investors/presentations.2017.html  
 
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  In order to deal with the digital divide that has arisen in the so -called 
marginal areas of Italy, which would otherwise remain excluded from the mainstream plans of telecommunicati ons operators 
due to the low profitability of investments, between 2005 and December 2015, TIM implemented a programme of investments 
allowing ADSL coverage (gross coverage1 > 70%) to be provided for 7,705 municipalities in total (4,355 more municipalities  than 
in December 2005).  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  As of December 2017, TIM , in Italy,  had activated the ADSL service in around 
9,690 exchanges, including 8,500 with optic fibre carriers. Alongside its plan to extend coverage, TIM has laun ched an additional 
plan to expand the active network2, where necessary, to guarantee full usability of the service by customers and the 
development of digital inclusion.  
 
[GRI 203 -1] [GRI 203 -2] The following table shows the percentages of coverage as of December of the past three years.  
  
 
 
 
(*) The percentage refers to fixed TIM telephone lines   
(**) The percentage refers to the residential population. Coverage values are subject to change based on ISTAT and urbanisations updates 
(***) The percentage is determined by the ratio between the number of p roperties connected with “cabinets” reached by access optical fibres (or which 
can be served directly from an exchange if within acceptable distances) and the total number of properties that have or have had active telephone lines 
in the past. The percentage does not include the areas covered by Open Fiber (in the cases where it has won the respective tenders)

technically be served due to the characteristics of the copper access network (presence of digital devices such as multiplexe s (MPX), Remote 
Concentration Units (RCUs), Multiplexes with Fibre Optic Backhauling (MD48), excessive distance from the exchange, etc.)  
2 The plan consists of actions to ensure full enjoyment of the service by customers by expanding the capacity of equipment used , in terms of both user 
ports and bandwidth available on the Internet . The technical term for this is desaturation of DSLAM equipment, performed either in advance or once

Since the percentages of coverage have now reached very high values (higher to 99.3% to cover and gross about 98% to cover 
gross - more than 2Mb/s), in recent years to extend the coverage of the geographic areas in "market failure", TIM has followed a 
selective approach and more targeted, aimed primarily at remedying any critical aspects local no cover and to improve the 
quality and speed of the servic e offered through interventions d'incrementodelle performances. The choice cade primarily on 
the reports and complaints local authorities involved or on situations of critical issues for the closure of prolonged marketing in 
certain areas "saturated".  
In some cases, the interventions are also carried out through collaboration "public -private", with the acquisition of spans in optic 
fiber cheap made available by some companies in-house  regional (INSIEL begun in Friuli Venezia -Giulia, Lepida Emilia -Romagn a 
or INVA in Valle d'Aosta).  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  Starting from the 2012 TIM has developed its network super fast broadband 
(also called "NGAN" - Next Access Generation Network) with the aim of bringing services high speed connectivity on optic fiber 
to most of the Italian territory.  
TIM chose to implement two different architectures by the NGAN network for the supply of services high speed optic fiber:  
•  architecture FTTC (Fiber To The Cabinet). The optic fiber part from central and ends up to the cabinet road, where is installed 
a device assets (UN) that transfers data traffic on the twisted pair copper until modem/routers at the customer site. The FTTC network, thanks to the technology eVDSL ( enhanced very high- speed Digital  Subscriber Line), can reach speed of 200 
Megabits per second and, with further technological developments, may be up to 300 Mb/s;    
•  architecture FTTH (Fiber To The Home). The optic fiber part from central and arrives directly inside apartments (through t he 
so-called "vertical"). At the customer site is installed a device assets (ONT) that transfers data traffic from optic toward the  
modem/routers. The FTTH network technology GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network), can reach speed of a gigabits per second and is developed in areas already covered FTTC, so as to ensure to customers choice in terms of speed connection .

[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] [GRI 203 -1] [GRI 203- 2] At the end of December 2017 the ultrabroadband 
network infrastructures of TIM has reached a coverage of about 77% of properties present throughout the Country; in particular 
more than:  
•  2,200 common were achieved by the service fiber FTTC;  
•  100 municipalities have also been achieved by the service Fiber FTTH technolo gy. 
During the second half of 2013 and throughout 2014, as part of the National Broadband Plan, the Ministry of Economic 
Development (MISE) issued eleven regional tenders through Infratel, identified as the implementing organisation and assignee of the fun ds provided
1. The tenders issued so far relate to six regions: Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Lazio, Molise, Puglia and 
Sicily. TIM has attended by all the above calls for tenders and it was awarded. Thanks to public funds and commitment of TIM,  
in the se ven regions the fiber optic coverage has reached very high levels, in sharp advance over the other Italian regions and 
objectives eu.

Brazil  
[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach] [GRI 203] A focus on innovation and investments in new infrastructure and 
technologies also characterise TIM's action in Brazil, a country where the Group has been operating since 1997 through its 
subsidiary TIM Participações and which is the Group's second biggest market. Its presence in Brazil has been increasing in recent 
years thanks to strategic acquisitions: the Intelig and AEM Atimus fixed network infrastructure has allowed the Group to strengthen the backbones and connecting links of the mobile network radio base stations through the use of fibre -optic cables 
which, in view of the development of LTE networks, are even more important and strategic.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  In the past 5 years alone, TIM has invested more than 7 billion euros in Brazil, 
focusing primarily on building new generation infrastructure and actively contributing to the modernisation of the country.  
Following the acquisition in 2014 of the right to use the 700  Mhz bandwidth (with an expenditure of 936 million euros), in 2017 
                                                                    
1 The move from broadband to super -fast broadband involves the gradual spread of the new  FTTC technology (based on the widespread use of fibre optic 
cables running from the exchange to a roadside cabinet) or FTTH technology (connected directly with the customer’s premises),  to replace previous 
technologies based entirely on the use of copper from the exchange to the customer's premises (typically ADSL). The new fibre optic technologies allow 
for download speeds of up to 1 Gbit/s (as opposed to the maximum speed of 20 Mbit/s achievable using ADSL technology).  Indicator  Unit of

TIM Brasil continued to invest in strengthening the infrastructure of the 3G network and achieved leadership in 4G, in terms of 
both the number of cities covered (411 at the end of 2017) and  coverage related to the urban population (91% at the end of 
2017).  
[GRI 203 -1] In Latin America, ever since it was introduced, mobile telephony has played a key role in the process of integrating 
more disadvantaged people, contributing to cohesion and to  involvement in social and democratic life. TIM Brasil manages 
almost 58.6 million mobiles lines and has always played a major role in this context. The work already done to extend mobile 
network coverage to the whole Country is continuing on a number of d evelopment fronts, which include improving the quality 
of the network in major cities, developing Mobile BroadBand and Fiber -To-The- Site (FTTS) in some cities, pilot small -cell and Wi -
Fi projects and developing the LT Amazonas Fiber transmission project in  the Amazonian region.  
[GRI 203 -2] TIM Participações is distinguished by projects social inclusion as Broadband Implementation Project for rural m arket 
failure  areas (Brazilian Nationa l Telecommunications Agency Obligation), which brings optic fiber in ce rtain municipalities of 
rural areas. However, the availability of infrastructure is only one of the ingredients and has to go hand- in-hand with an overall 
digital growth of the population in a literacy development process that will increase demand and stimulate investments. In this 
context the project has reached 800 municipalities and 4,007 schools  (November 2017).   
The aim is to encourage and disseminating the use and distribution of goods and ICT services to remotest as well as making more accessible ser vices for all segments of the population, contributing to reduce inequalities economic and social sciences.

their conduct on business propriety, transparency in contractual relations and undertakings, courtesy and collaboration, 
ensuring customer focus and in full compliance with the principles established by company policies and procedures. 
Cooperation wi th consumer associations, which includes entering into specific agreements with them, is also highly valued.  
The relevant stakeholders are:

Customer Satisfaction  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 102], [GRI 102 -43] The telecommunications market is undergoing radical change 
as a result of technological innovations and greater consumer choice in an increasingly competitive market. Interaction with 
markets that offer increasing digital access to services is raising customers’ expectations towards telecommunications 
companies which, in recent years, have been striving to set out n ew business models. Against this backdrop, TIM has 
undertaken a transformation process to make way for the "digital” future.  
Quality and customer experience are the building blocks of this journey: the customer is at the heart of TIM and all processe s to 
improve the quality of service and strengthen the relationship with the brand.  
TIM has developed an extensive listening system to keep track of the customer experience at the various moments of the 
customer journey1, e.g. web browsing, purchasing a service, calling customer care, reporting a malfunction, posting on social 
media.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102 -43] Of the surveys conducted, the monitoring of the Customer 
Satisfaction Index (CSI), based on the ACSI standard (American Custo mer Satisfaction Index), is particularly significant. The aim 
is to collect information on the quality perceived by TIM customers and the main competitors. Monitoring the CSI has earned 
certification of conformity with standard UNI 11098:2003 and has been included in the managerial incentive system 
(management by objectives). The 2017 CSI results confirmed the high levels seen in 2016 (75 .30 for the whole year; -0.3% 
compared to 2016)2. The ties customers demonstrated with respect to the Group are also seen  in the high propensity to loyalty, 
in an increasingly competitive context where the consumer’s experience is enriched through comparison with different markets.

•  “customer journey lab”: the project aims to allow colleagues/investigators to experience the service received by consumer 
customers first -hand by selecting, purchasing, activating and using services, so as to identify the customer’s perception and 
the main areas requiring attention/strengths;  
•  “Chi-ama TIM”: a tool used by TIM employees to channel reports received from customers, friends or acquaintances 
regarding the fixed line service requirements of consumer customers, of a commercial and technical nature. The project makes employees active part icipants as the promoters of solutions in the management of customers.

website offers customers the chance to:  
•  interact with the Company regar ding the technical network coverage map for each individual street;  
•  receive notifications regarding both maintenance and any failures to achieve technical network objectives;  
•  provide TIM with feedback on the perceived quality of the network.  
In 2017, TIM P articipações reinforced its commitment to developing the digital environment in order to improve the quality of 
services provided to its customers. It optimised the "My TIM App" channel which, in December 2017, 4.7 million  users and 23.1 
million accesses p er month. For example, sent in PDF format, the customer can see their invoice in advance with a breakdown 
of the services used and their costs; the customer is also identified automatically when connecting to the TIM network, witho ut 
entering a user name and password (transparent authentication).

[GRI 102 -43] [GRI 102- 44]  USE	  OF	  SOCIAL	  NETWORKING	  IN	  CUSTOMER	  CARE  
In recent years, the TIM Customer Relationship Management has been increasingly focused on the monitoring of new digital 
contexts, identifying the future of assistance, care and loyalty o f its customers in the monitoring and management of caring 
contacts obtained from the social networks (Twitter and Facebook). From 2010, TIM launched the Caring on Social Media 
project and, over the years, has built up a new relationship with digital mobil e and landline telephone customers, building trust 
by re- engineering and reviewing processes, developing management systems, extending monitoring times and investing in 
the training of social caring agents.  
In 2017, TIM set up various projects aimed at im proving the service provided and monitoring quality, such as:  
1) quality checks on the work carried out by a dedicated pool;  
2) re- engineering the social tool platform, improving the operator features and planning a new dashboard for monitoring the 
main KP Is; 
3) training updates on aspects of communication.  
In 2017, TIM's social caring team managed 1,129K caring interactions on the Facebook page and 247K on Twitter; in particular 
the customer care demand amounted to 899K for mobile and 477K for fixed line.   
According to the Socialbakers agency, TIM confirms its digital leadership, positioning itself in the rankings for the fourth quarter 
of 2017 as the number -ten brand internationally and the number -one brand in Italy for customer service o n Facebook, with a 
response time of five minutes and a response rate of 99% of the posts published on the page (AMIQ indicator1, parameter 
calculated based on the ratio of the number of public posts managed and the response time by the brand over 24 hours).  
TIM has confirm ed its social role, in exclusive collaboration with Civil Protection Department in the event of environmental 
emergencies, engaging influencers or promoting specific training in order to help ensure a fast and far -reaching spread - via 
the network - of information that is useful to the population.  
TIM’s social networks have also made a key contribution to enhancing and promoting social, cultural and innovative initiative s 
(e.g. the project to test 5G technology launched in Turin and which involved the citi es of Bari and Matera; in terms of 
communication, support for Start and MeravigliosaMENTE, TV programmes giving exposure to the world of start -ups and 
Italian leaders in research and academia). 
All this has enabled TIM to consolidate its leadership in the various communities that have been created in the different social 
networks ( facebook, twitter, google+, instagram, youtube) around the main brands: TIM, TIM Impresa Semplice, TIMvision, 
TIMmusic, Working Capital, Serie A TIM, FantaserieA TIM, Nuvola Italiana, with more than 11 million likers and followers.

[GRI 102 -43] [GRI 102- 44]  INVOLVEMENT	  OF	  CALL	  CENTRE	  OPERATORS  
In 2017, the activities involving call centre operators focused on improving basic knowledge and the process of providing 
information/training through the TUO portal (acronym for Trova, Usa and Organizza – ‘Find Use and Organise’). Specifically, 
the actions focused on:  
•  stabilising all mini -sites on the new Drupal platform with a more dynamic and effective structure and a simp lified search 
list. By January 2017, all content supporting the 119 and 187 services was migrated onto this platform, and personalised 
with the launch of the respective mini -sites;  
•  activating the control tools for the training/information activities planne d to check the content circulated. Monthly surveys 
were carried out to assess the learning for the 119 and 187 mini -sites;  
•  distributing the mobile consumer newsletter to increase visibility of the content published, with a focus on key issues for 
current b usiness. From October 2017, the 119 mini- site has its own ‘PARLIAMO DI’ newsletter (as the 187 service has had for 
years)...  
•  sending the welcome flyer to the customer, one of the tools to support customer contact with the aim of providing precise 
informati on on the timeframes and processes for activating the main offers. Features of the 187 mini -site include – during 
inbound and outbound contacts – the sending of the WELCOME KIT FIBRA to the customer (in the FTTH and FTTC 
versions), as well as the document providing support with TIMVISION REGISTRATION. 
 
PEDIUS - Managing calls for the hearing impaired  
In addition to the usual channels, PEDIUS is a channel that provides access to TIM's call centres for the hearing impaired . The 
trial phase was launched in Se ptember 2014 and the service:  
•  is available to all customers on app stores (both Apple and Android);  
•  aims to ensure that inbound contact is accessible to hearing -impaired customers through an app that allows normal calls 
to be made using voice synthesis and  recognition technology.  
RUNNING	  OF	  THE	  SERVICE 	  
The Customer downloads the Pedius APP, which contains the 187 and 119 access numbers. The app calls the support number 
and the answering agent sees the number of origin of the APP, the telephone with which th e customer is calling, he/she listens 
to the request and replies through the APP, which translates the voice response into written text.  
In 2017, TIM managed over 350 reports from landline and mobile customers who used the Pedius APP to seek 
assistance/information on TIM services (70%), sales processes (15%) and complaints.  
 
Customer Satisfaction within incentives schemes  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102- 44] TIM's managerial (Management by Objectives) and collective 
(perfo rmance bonus) incentive systems include objectives associated with customer satisfaction indicators in keeping with the 
business plan for the current period. The targets are made up of several aspects corresponding to different market segments.

Conciliation procedures  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102 -43] [GRI 102 -44] The conciliation procedure between TIM and the 
consumer protection associations who signed the framework agreement for the out -of-court settlement of telephone di sputes, 
was the first example of joint conciliation in Italy. Introduced on a trial basis in 1991 by SIP, it was implemented througho ut the 
country in 1993 and in 1995 the European Union recognised it as a "Pilot project for consumer access to justice". Ov er the years, 
the procedure has been gradually aligned to new regulations, computerised and made increasingly user -friendly, while 
maintaining the core values that made it a tool of excellence in improving customer relations and transparency of various 
operational processes of the company.  
In 2011, the joint conciliation model was brought to the attention of the European Union and, in the same year, the European 
Parliament recognised the Italian joint conciliation model as an example of best practice based  on a protocol drawn up and 
signed by the company and consumer protection associations, under which the company undertakes in advance to use an 
alternative tool for settling disputes that may arise in the areas covered by the “ADR protocol1”. There are 22 consumer 
associations that have signed up to the conciliation agreement to date, 19 of which are registered with the CNCU (National 
Council of Consumers and Users), an organisation representing consumer associations and users at national level, chaired by 
the Italian Ministry of Economic Development, with the task of contributing to improve and strengthen the consumer/user’s market position. In 2016, with the coming into force of Legislative Decree No. 130/2016, in transposition of European Directi ve 
No. 20 13/11/EU on ADR, the Joint Conciliation Body ‘TIM -Associazioni dei consumatori’ (TIM Consumer Associations) was 
recognised as an "ADR Body" for the management of dispute resolution. It was also included – by directive issued by the Italian 
Ministry of Econ omic Development of 28 November 2016 – in the list of ADR Bodies established by AGCom (Italian 
Communications Authority), thereby confirming that it meets the stability, efficiency and impartiality requirements laid down  in 
the new European and Italian reg ulatory framework. Following the establishment of the ADR Body, the Joint Conciliation 
Regulation was reviewed, as were the application procedures of the conciliation protocol established between TIM and the 
consumer associations registered on the CNCU.  
Year after year, the joint conciliation model adopted with the consumer associations has confirmed its position as a model of success in terms of efficiency for customers, promoting loyalty in those dissatisfied as a result of any problems.  
Undoubtedly, conc iliation is successful also thanks to the good relations built up and maintained over the years with consumer 
associations which, as stakeholders of the company, have always provided a wealth of information through their contributions.    
In addition to joint conciliation, TIM can also implement conciliation with Co.Re.Com (Regional Communication Committees) and Chambers of Commerce. Since 2009, in compliance with the voluntary undertakings given and approved by the Italian Communications Authority in 2008, TIM has also been managing conciliation requests at Co.Re.Com and Chamber of Commerce 
offices, replicating the organisational model successfully applied for joint conciliations. In this way, customers can choose  to use 
the consumer associations or follow alternative paths, such as those mentioned above, to settle any disputes with the Company 
out of court.  
In any event, the underlying aspect of the conciliation is the customer's needs, irrespective of the procedure they choose, making it possible to build up a good relationship between the customer and the Company.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102 -43] [GRI 102 -44] To date, the conciliation model has achieved 
high qualitative and quantitative results. Specifically, in 2017 the use of the Co .Re.Com channel continued to see significant

figures, accounting for 70% of the conciliations discussed, while the Joint channel accounted for 28.3% of the requests 
discussed, with the Chamber of Commerce channel making up the remaining 1.7%.  
The positive trend seen in the conciliation system in previous years continued in 2017 (albeit with a significant increase in the 
number of cases handled); in fact:  
•  97% of the requests for equal conciliation discussed (13,873 out of 14,302) were reconciled, a percentage that is stable year 
on year despite the 15.9% increase in the cases discussed in 2017 with respect to the previous year (12,342 in 2016);  
•  84.1% of the requests discussed at the Co.Re.Com and Chambers of Commerce were reconciled (30,551 reconciled out of 
36,313 discussed). This percentage remained high in 2017, even higher than the previous year, considering the 21.2% 
increase in the cases discussed compared to 2016 (29,961 in 2016). 
 
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102- 43] [GRI 102 -44] TIM supported the conciliation activity through:  
•  seminars and joint training initiatives involving dedicated personnel from TIM, AGCom, Co.Re.Com. and Consumer Associations;  
•  debates, conferences, interviews and other promotional activities involving senior management in order to disseminate the 
correct cultural approach to the subject.   
Conciliation is becoming increasingly widespread among customers, particularly in view of the:  
•  better knowledge of the procedure, which is considered to be a quick and economi cal way of resolving disputes;  
•  economic crisis, which leads people to resort to conciliation even for small amounts (e.g. potential inefficiencies involved in 
transferring from one operator to another);  
•  large number of Co.Re.Com, which are opening provincial offices in many regions to make the conciliation system more easily available to people (avoiding the costs involved in travelling to regional capitals).  
 
Brazil 
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102 -43] [GRI 102 -44] In Brazil, TIM has close relations with 
government -run consumer rights associations, including SENACON (National Consumer Protection Secretariat) and PROCONS 
(Consumer protection and defence programme). Since 2011, the TIM Participações is considered to receive the lowest nu mber of 
complaints made to PROCONS regarding the telecommunications sector.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102 -43] [GRI 102 -44] In 2014, SENACON launched the Consumer.Gov 
platform, which makes it easier to resolve customer complaints and s implifies the work done by PROCONS. TIM Participações 
was one of the first companies to sign up to this platform and has undertaken to resolve all the complaints registered on it.  
Customers can state on the platform if the complaint has been resolved or no t and review the quality of the response given by 
the company. On average for the whole of 2017, TIM Participações’ rating was 3.8 on a scale of one to five.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102 -43] [GRI 102 -44] In 2014, in accordance with t he obligations laid 
down by Anatel, TIM Participações set up the Users Council, whose tasks include putting forward solutions to improve the 
services provided to users.

In 2017, the Users Council:  
•  together with the Public Defence Department, created a new  conciliation channel called “Canal 0800 Defensoria Publica” 
(Channel 0800 Public Defence) to avoid complaints being lodged with the courts by providing a free direct line for 
communication between public defenders and TIM. In 2017, this channel was availa ble to the Departments of Public Defence 
of 20 States. For 2018, the aim is to implement it in all the federal states that have a consumer protection centre in the 
Department of Public Defence;  
•  provided training to some PROCONs and Public Defence Departmen ts on TIM services (invoicing, top -ups, plans) to reduce 
the number of complaints.  In terms of information accessibility, TIM Participações provided the Consumer Code both in Braille and in Brazilian sign language (“Libras”) on the Users Council website. It released the information guide for users of 
telecommunications services in a digital version and in Braille. Moreover, in Curitiba, TIM Participações launched a pilot 
solution geared towards transparency for its conciliation procedures, focusing on the training of in -store staff. They were 
advised to introduce the Brazilian government platform "consumidor.gov.br" after showing the Company’s complaint 
resolution channels.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102 -43] [GRI 102 -44] In 2017, TIM ac hieved excellent results in settling 
claims submitted by PROCON offices: CIPs (Preliminary Investigation Letters) 79%; justified complaints 7 8% (source: SENACON 
official report).  
TIM also has relationships with consumer protection associations like ABRAREC , IDEC and PROTEST, which promote a culture of 
good relations between companies and customers, improve training and ensure excellent customer service. TIM also takes part 
in the conciliation forum between companies and customer defence bodies, for the purp ose of resolving conflicts in a proactive 
manner.

Child protection  
[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [GRI 102 -2b] The 2017 materiality analysis highlighted the protection of 
vulnerable categories, and therefore of minors, as a material topic.  
 [GRI  103- 2: Management Approach] [GRI 102] [102- 2b] Group Companies have undertaken numerous initiatives to protect 
children from content that may harm their psychological and physical development (for example, content that is violent, racist, 
offensive to religious sentiment, etc.).  
Adult services come under value added services (also called Premium or content -based services) and can be supplied by TIM or 
external companies that own the content vi a SMS, MMS or mobile internet services (WAP - wireless application protocol), which 
can be activated, received and/or used on mobile phones, tablets and PCs. The TIM card, once activated, is enabled to use val ue 
added services with adult content, excluding  TIM cards registered in the name of a minor for whom adult content services are 
disabled.  
The TIM Group – in accordance with current regulations – provides the customer with a series of tools to protect minors from 
accessing the sensitive content provided . TIM constantly updates and communicates these tools to the customer, through its

own information channels (including the 119 customer service and the website  www.tim.it ).  The protection tools currently 
available to customers are:   
•  permanent restriction of mobile users from accessing adult content;  
•  adult content provided on the TIM mobile portal ("TIM WAP") can only be accessed by entering a code (adult PIN) on the 
user’s mobile device, which is different from all other codes used on the device itself in order to prevent minors from 
accessing said content. The customer is provided with the adult PIN confidentially, and is responsible for its proper use and  
safeguarding;   
•  customers can ask for their mobile number to b e restricted from accessing sensitive content other than adult content at any 
time via TIM’s usual information channels.   
Further information regarding the activation and deactivation of the above protection tools is available at www.tim.it, from 
Customer Services on 119 and from authorised TIM retail outlets.  
The TIM -Protect solution is the exclusive TIM option for total protection against WEB threats: 
•  parental control : protects young people while surfing the Net, filters web searches, gives warnings in the case of behaviour 
that is judged to be dangerous, allows you to block access to sites or apps or limit their use (maximum usage time setting);  
•  theft protection : protects the device from loss and/or theft, ensuring remote control by sending a simple ins truction (block 
device, find device, delete data, SIM change notification);  
•  protection and privacy : protects all access to e -commerce, home banking and social media websites. Ensures privacy by 
filtering unwanted calls and messages. 
•  antivirus : manages the device securely without affecting its operation, protecting it during use against viruses, malware1 and 
other threats.  
The Company is particularly focussing attention on parental control, with the launch of offers dedicated to the younger 
generation (under  12s) with the TIM Protect service included, at no additional cost. The Company is also implementing 
comarketing2 initiatives with certain operating partners in the “kids” segment, which is particularly sensitive to matters of child 
protection. [GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 102] [GRI 102- 2b] At the end of 2017, 159,385 customers had activated 
TIM Protect.  
Tim has brought out new releases of the TIM Protect Android app to improve the User Experience of customers using the TIM Protect service. In July  2017, it also released the TIM Protect app for IOS

etc.) and the competent authorities, and has the task of coordinating, within the TIM Group, the process of abuse management, 
in accordance with the relevant legislative framework. Furthermore, the TIM Group has adopted an organisational and 
management model pur suant to Legislative Decree 231/2001, aimed at preventing offences that may result in liability for the 
company.  
TIM has deployed resources, technologies, processes and tools to prevent and tackle “abuse”, i.e. any activity committed in 
violation of the rules of conduct and the legislation that governs the use of network services, digital systems or means of 
communication in general. The SOC (Security Operations Centre) oversees the following initiatives and activities:  
•  form available on TIM’s corporate an d commercial portals, which can be used by TIM’s end customers, or by outsider users, 
to report any crimes involving child pornography encountered while browsing the internet. There is a guide to completion, and reports can also be submitted anonymously. T his activity is managed in collaboration with the Assurance Competence 
Centre, under Open Access/Wholesale, which receives reports and forwards them to be managed by the SOC;  
•  management of the abuse desks, operational groups that handle abuse differentiate d by type of service (set up in 
accordance with national and EU regulations on child protection), the prevention of cybercrime and the fight against sexual 
exploitation (child pornography). The abuse desks receive reports from external users/customers on a lleged cybercrimes or 
the presence of child pornography on the Group’s networks, they then direct them to the relevant department, where 
necessary involving the relevant authorities (through the Key Contact for the Postal Police);  
•  filtering: in accordance with the implementing Decree of Law 38/2006 (Gentiloni Decree) which defines the technical 
prerequisites of filtering tools that providers of Internet network connections must use in order to prevent access to sites identified by the Postal Police through the CNCPO. TIM has also introduced a filtering system for foreign websites with child 
pornography content;  
•  gambling: in accordance with Article 1, subsection 50, of Law 296/2006 – on tackling tax evasion and tax avoidance in the 
gambling sector – and at the request of the Italian Autonomous Administration of State Monopolies (AAMS), TIM blocks the 
resources as and when they are reported, making them inaccessible to customers.  
Moreover, TIM participates in the following initiatives:  
•  “GSMA - Mobile Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Content” work group in the context of the GSM Association, for 
technological, policy and communications initiatives aimed at protecting children in the mobile phone sector;  
•  Alliance to better protect chil dren online", platform launched by the European Commission as part of the Better Internet for 
Kids (“BIK”) strategy for defining and implementing the principles and technologies required to make the internet a safer 
place for children;  
•  "Missing Child Alert" launched with the Italian Ministry of the Interior, Department of Public Security;  
•  Safer Internet Centre (SIC) – Connected Generations (national centre for promoting safe and positive use of the internet and 
digital technologies, co -financed by the Europ ean Commission as part of the Connecting Europe Facility and coordinated by 
the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research), where it is a member of the Advisory Board. TIM has taken part 
in two working groups:  
ü  "schools" with the aim of mapp ing out all organisations that carry out information activities in schools, and setting out a 
shared policy to ensure a minimum quality level and standard for activities in schools;  
ü  "communication" with the aim of helping to set out and spread a communicat ion campaign development plan, as well 
as materials to raise awareness.   
For the Safer Internet Day (7 February 2017), the international day, established by the European Union, focusing on Internet -
related risks, TIM launched the 
Navigare Sicuri  app (created by TIM in collaboration with the Italian State Police) to raise 
awareness among the youngest users of the web and make parents and educators conscious of the importance  of digital 
education.    TIM Sustainability Report 2017

Moreover, the Group has also activated appropriate filtering and abuse prevention systems, including for services provided in  
Brazil: images, backgrounds, video streaming, audio content (podcasts) together with brief erotic informat ion via SMS and 
images via MMS (in partnership with a content provider). Customers can buy services with sexy content through the main page 
of the WAP portal; to enter, customers must click on “ADULT”, declare they are of age and enter a password. TIM Part icipações

Product responsibility  
[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417] [GRI 419]  The 2017 materiality analysis highlighted customer 
relations as a material topic which, for TIM, also incorporates responsibility for the products and services offered.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417] [GRI 419]  TIM is primarily an operator of telecommunications 
services, which do not endanger the physical health of users 1, and it does not produce the telecommunications equipment it 
sells2.   
In order to verify that the products placed on the market comply with health and safety legislation, the C ompany has:  
•  appropriate internal structures that check the incoming quality of the products it markets (telephones, modems, etc.), both 
in Italy and in the production centres of manufacturers overseas;  
•  laboratories that test the products marketed by the Group, particularly as regards the electromagnetic emissions of the 
mobile phones.  
In this way, any non -conformities of products are detected prior to their market release, ensuring that products that do not 
conform with the essential requirements of the European Directives do not reach the end customer.  
Services provided to customers are subject to the requirements set out in the Service Charters and in the Terms & Conditions o f 
Subscription, available at telecomitalia.com.

On the protection and safe use of equipment by customers, the Group carries out checks on the technical provisions introduced 
to reduce the risk of electrocution, overheating, fire and mechanical hazards, by applying stand ards EN 60950- 1 and EN 60065.  
Furthermore, TIM checks:  
•  the energy efficiency aspects required by Directive 2009/125/EC ErP (Energy- related -Products):  equipment placed on the 
market is checked against the stand- by/off -mode power consumption and performance  limits set by European Regulations 
1275/2008/EC, 801/2013/EC and 278/2009/EC, for equipment and their external power supplies  (available as accessories);  
•  functionality in different environmental conditions of installation and use of terminals and accessor y components for 
connection to the fixed network: checks are carried out on compliance with temperature and humidity ranges established by 
ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) for the specific "service condition", on which different "seve rity" 
levels are based. The checks are carried out based on the provisions of the ETSI EN 300019 standards, with the tests set out 
under IEC -EN series 60068 -2-1 (cold), 2 (dry heat), 14 (temperature changes), 30 (moisture changes), 78 (continuous 
humidity) . For the most widely available products, with external plastic parts (e.g. AG, Access Gateway), "flame resistance" 
is checked in the event of malfunctions of the internal electrical parts;  
•  electromagnetic compatibility aspects, regulated by Directive 2014 /30/EU (replacing the previous Directive 2004/108/EU): 
unintentional electromagnetic signal emissions are checked – to avoid interference that can harm radio communication – 
and to fulfil certain electromagnetic interference immunity requirements.  In TIM constant checks are carried out on 
terminals and network equipment to determine whether they comply with the requirements of international ETSI, CENELEC 
(European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) standards regarding electromagnetic compatibi lity. In particular, 
checks are carried out on the compliance of equipment with the limits set by standards to limit the emission of 
electromagnetic disturbances which, in addition to polluting the surrounding environment, can interfere with radio 
communic ations.  
 
Brazil 
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417]  By law, telecommunications equipment sold in Brazil must be 
approved by the regulatory authority ANATEL, which verifies, in its laboratories, the conformity with Brazilian legislation o n 
electrical and electromagnetic safety. There is specific legislation to be complied with for each kind of equipment. TIM 
Participações asks its suppliers to ensure that devices have the ANATEL certificate of approval. 
[GRI 416 -2] Over the past three years,  no non- conformities with European customer health and safety legislation have been 
found in any product that has reached the final marketing stage, neither in Italy nor in Brazil.  
[GRI 417 -1] When contracts are drafted, for all fixed telephony products, TIM requires packaging to include an environmental 
statement, a statement about the origin of the tantalum if it has been used in the components, a user manual containing safet y 
information, details of any hazardous materials in the product and disposal in formation. With regard to labelling of mobile 
devices, as they are consumer products that TIM merely resells and do not require any customisation, the Company simply requires national legislation to be complied with.  
[GRI 417 -1] In Brazil, in addition to compliance with national legislation, TIM requires information on the correct use of 
equipment; Tim Participações does not have the procedures on the information and labels on products and services.  Contracts 
with suppliers of mobile devices include a 'pro duct packaging’ clause, which requires that each box contain instructions for the 
correct use of both the product and the accessory assembly kit and the connection jacks associated with the product.

There have however been a few cases in which non -conformities with regulations concerning information about services have 
been found.  More specifically, in 2017 in B razil had occurred 13 accidents for a total sanctions 896,730 reais  (226 ,031 euro) , in 
2016 had occurred three accidents for a total fines equal to 743,750 reais  (216 ,495 euro) , in 2015 there was an incident for a total

Italy  
The regulatory Authority's sanctioning procedures for non- conformities with regulations regarding information on services are 
part of the system of “penalties for the violation of regulatory legislation regarding consumer protection in the supply and use of 
TLC products and services”; which means that, for Italy, non -conformities regarding information on services have been merged 
with non -conformities regarding the supply and use of services (table below) .

Safeguarding privacy and personal data protection  
[GRI 103 -1: Mana gement Approach] [GRI 418] The 2017 materiality analysis highlighted the safeguarding of privacy and 
personal data protection as a material topic.   
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 418] In order to ensure that personal data is protected in the performance of 
business activities, TIM has applied an organisational model, since 2003, which includes a Privacy Department supervising

correct application of the relevant regulations throughout th e Group (according to Legislative Decree 193/03, known as the 
known as  the "Privacy Code"). In this context, when it establishes or acquires new companies, the Parent Company also provides 
the support required to identify and carry out the formalities requ ired. 
The adoption of legal measures and the instructions of the Privacy Guarantor for personal data protection is assured by 
constantly updating the Group regulations and policies. Of these, the "System of rules for the application of the privacy law  in 
the TIM Group" is particularly important; it defines the provisions and operating instructions to comply with these provisions , 
completely reviewed in 2015 and updated in 2017, to incorporate amendments to the law and take account of the introduction 
of new  services for customers.  
A major development in the regulatory framework is European Union Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 on the protection of natural 
persons with regard to personal data processing (so -called "General Data Protection Regulation" or GDPR), w hich will be 
applicable in Italy and the other EU Member States from 25 May 2018.  
This regulation will introduce various innovations, including:  
•  harmonisation of legislation, with common rules directly applicable across the EU;  
•  applicability also to non- EU parties that process the data of people in the EU for specific purposes;  
•  the level of significance of the obligations in relation to the privacy and accountability risk of entities that process data (e.g. 
provisions on the privacy impact assessment,  documentation of activities, security and data breach measures, and the 
introduction of the role of Data Protection Officer);  
•  economic significance of the sanctions applicable in case of violation.  
TIM has set out a plan to adapt to the GDPR to create n ew obligations and guarantee the Group Companies’ compliance in 
terms of personal data processing by the deadline of 25 May 2018, taking into account the technological and organisational 
context of the business activities. Specifically, the adjustment plan  was developed by conducting a prior analysis of the GDPR 
provisions and subsequently identifying the areas of intervention, which led to working groups being set up whose activities are 
routinely monitored. These working groups guide the key changes at TI M introduced by the GDPR, including those relating to: 
processing registers (to document all personal data processing carried out by TIM), privacy impact assessment (for personal data processing with a high "Privacy” risk), data breaches (covering all type s of personal data), rights of those concerned 
(following the introduction of the new right to be forgotten and right to personal data portability), as well as the Data Pro tection 
Officer (mandatory position for TIM, whose role is to facilitate compliance with the GDPR provisions for senior management, 
which is required to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the provisions on the basis of the accountability principle).  
Moreover, over 2017, there was an ongoing focus on the subject of telemarketing, which  is an important tool for TIM’s business 
activity. TIM has always been committed to ensuring that telemarketing is carried out in compliance with the rules: TIM has no interest in contacting people who have stated that they do not want to receive promotion al calls, given the negative impact this 
can have on its relationship with customers and, more generally, its reputation.  To this end, once again in the current year, 
training initiatives were carried out in the area of privacy, particularly involving inte rnal staff that have been reassigned to 
Commercial Departments so that the privacy obligations to be introduced in sales and telemarketing activities are properly understood and applied. The effective application of the regulations is monitored through a c ontrol system based on regular 
self-assessment procedures by those responsible for handling the data, and on sample checks carried out by the relevant 
central and regional departments, based on established procedures and methods. In consideration of these activities, a periodic 
report is envisaged on the status of adoption of the security measurements envisaged by privacy legislation that, in a compan y 
document, formalises the activities carried out to guarantee compliance with the provisions on personal da ta processing, the 
results achieved and the status of improvement plans.  
Finally, also during the course of 2017, TIM continued to take the steps required to respond to the information requests TIM 
received from the Italian Data Protection Authority, as we ll as to ensure the implementation of provisions in its internal   TIM Sustainability Report 2017

processes to deal with any violation of personal data security relating to electronic communication services (so -called “data

Brazil 
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 418] As pursuant to article 5 of the Federal Constitution, and article 3 of the 
General Law on Telecommunications no. 9.472 of 1997 the right of customers to the confidentiality of their personal data is 
established (e xcept the cases provided for by the law). The personal mobile service regulation, in articles 89, 90 and 91 of 
Resolution 477 of the national telecommunications agency (ANATEL), requires companies to take responsibility in this respect and establishes that any waiver of confidentiality must take place only if requested by the relevant authority in the cases 
provided for by law. Federal Law no. 12,965 (Marco Civil) of April 2014, articles 10 and 11, ensures the privacy and protecti on of 
personal data for Int ernet users.  
TIM Participações only sends customer data at the request of the competent Authorities, as determined by law.  In accordance 
with the above legislation, TIM Participações has issued relevant internal policies and procedures, one of which is a specific 
policy for safeguarding privacy, based on the "need to know" principle (personal data processing is restricted to the minimum  
required to carry out the work) and separation of functions 1. These policies and procedures recall the methods for the 
classification and management of information in order to guarantee suitable protection levels.  
 All suppliers of value added services (VAS) must sign an agreement with TIM on the non -disclosure of information regarding 
customer privacy.  
[GRI 103 -3: Managemen t Approach] [GRI 418] [GRI 418- 1] TIM Participações in 2017 has received 49 complaints from 
customers, of which for eight judges are expressed in favor of the Company, for ten there was the closure following or a 
liquidation or convicted payment of an inde mnity to its customers, the amount of which fluctuated R$ 1 ,500  to R$ 4 ,000 ; at the 
end of 2017, there was still 41 cases pending, open between 2015 and 2017.   
In 2016, TIM Participações received 14 complaints of alleged violations of privacy from customer s (the process is in the initial 
stages). There were no complaints in 2015.  It should be noted that the difference between the legislations of Italy and Brazil

Assuming that average per capita energy consumption for public lighting in Italy is 101 kWh 1and applying a 20% reduction  (the 
replacement of conventional lamps with high efficiency ones is in progress in many towns) a town of 100,000 inhabitants would  
be able to achieve a total annual saving of 2,020,000 kWh, corresponding to 781 t of CO2 (Scope2) emissions avoided2. 
Smart City and Open Air Lab  
Open	  Air	  Lab	  (OAL):	  TIM’s	  smart	  city	  lab	  for	  sustainable	  cities. 	  
The Open Air Lab, located at TiLab in Turin, represents aspects of a Smart City model, and the transformations that ICT 
enterprises and the always -connected dimension will define for the urban scenarios of the upcoming years. At the OAL the 
various models are illustrated, like Smart Mobility, smart rest areas, the efficient management of waste and public green are as, 
the service robotics, urban security, the public lighti ng network, Smart Metering, gas, electricity and water distribution networks, 
Digital Island services, with the loan of books and the distribution of food and drink and the public telephone totem.  
Moreover, in a garden area, there are objects fitted with s ensors for data detection and transmission, such as:  
•  the smart bench to facilitate social aggregation, which provides connectivity, reproduces light games and music on -line and 
detects air parameters (atmospheric pressure, pollution indicator, temperature,  humidity and light);  
•  the small greenhouse with weather and environmental sensors to be activated from a remote position and according to weather conditions, sources of light/heat or pumps for watering plants;  
•  the little dome, container of urban waste with  sensors (smart waste), to track and improve the efficiency of sorted waste 
collection;  
•  bus platform with Wi -Fi access to the portal with traffic and environmental sensors;  
•  the lamps that can be switched on and have light regulated from a remote position; 
•  the noise and environmental pollution sensors ; 
•  the gas and water meters to provide customers with a service offering more information and greater efficiency;  
•  by replacing the old telephone booths, the TIM City Link allows browsing on the internet and advertising in addition to VoIP 
calls.  
In the visits to the OAL, attention is focussed on the technological scenarios of the Internet of Things that will characteri ze the 
innovation of the upcoming decades; it is an evolving use of the Internet, whereby ob jects will become recognizable and ‘smart’ 
by communicating data collected on themselves and in the environment. Analysts foresee a world, in the next few years, where 
tens of millions of objects will be connected to each other

An integral and fundament al part of the Open Air Lab is the Control Room where, on an ICON IoT Connectivity Platform, the 
data from the widespread sensors, which provides the innovative services, is collected and stored. In particular, the ICON is  and

IoT	  Open	  Lab	  	   	  
On 16 November 2016, TIM opened the Internet of Things Open Lab which became fully operational in 2017, at its base in Turin.  
Its purpose, according to the methods inherent in Open Innovation, is to sup port the development of IoT solutions based on key 
technologies for the telecommunications operator. In particular, the IoT Open Lab acts as a business accelerator to support 
companies in entering the ecosystem of technologies standardised by the 3GPP 3 and, as regards the current period, Narrow 
Band IoT technologies. The market is, in fact, moving fast and the Internet of Things sector requires narrowband solutions that 
are capable of limiting battery consumption in sensors. A presence on the market is possible if solutions can be put forward quickly.  
To gain a competitive edge, the Lab pro vides expertise, radio coverage and data collection devices and platforms to enable 
potential partner companies to prepare prototypes and solutions as quickly as possible. As of December 2017, more than 130 companies and customers have visited the Lab, and  among them around 40 construction companies have agreed a partnership 
with TIM, allowing them to use what the Lab offers free of charge.  
The result is a virtuous circle of value creation, on one hand for companies which can quickly create new solutions f or the 
market and, on the other, for the telecommunications company which can find an ecosystem capable of using the radio technologies made available by its network.  
	  
LTE	  Public	  Safety	   	  
Video services in the fixed and mobile sector used for public safety and protection are among the areas that can benefit most – 
both in performance and functional terms – from the availability of the LTE infrastructure and subsequently from 5G.  
LTE Public Safety is TIM's service for video -surveillance on the move, which is  able to collect video streams from different 
sources spread out across the country in real time (smartphones, encoders, video -cameras, drones).   
The main active features are:  
•  real-time high -quality video streaming (mpg4 with bit rate from 1.5 to over 4Mps);  
•  management of various videos on web consoles for Police Stations with the service enabled;  
•  GPS localisation at the same time as the video capture, messaging and PTT (Push To Talk) features.  
 
The architecture provides security when both accessing an d contributing/using the video streams thanks to reliable protocols. 
All video contributions are recorded with every local Police Station for subsequent investigations and use.

With its service on the LTE mobile network, since 2014 TIM has been the sole te chnological partner of the main Italian Central 
Police Stations for services relating to Public Security, including for major international events. In April 2017, the servic e was 
made available to another 7 Central Police Stations (Turin, Bologna, Bari, Na ples, Palermo, Catania and Taormina).  
In particular, for the Taormina G7 Summit (May 2017), the service was used in all possible ways: on the ground, on helicopter s, at 
sea and, for the first time, the Public Safety platform integrated the videos captured by drones of various constructors (Nimbus, 
IDS, Flytop) which are ENAC -certified and State Police suppliers. The drones were used both in free -flight and controlled mode 
(up to 100 metres); here the PTZ commands were operated remotely in a web console to m onitor the payload from the 
operating centre.  
 
In numerical terms, the Taormina G7 recorded:  
•  up to 140 video sessions per day,  
•  around 100 hours of video recording,  
•  bit rate transmission over 4  Mbps,    
•  a total of over 62 GB of video traffic.  
	  
The	  big	  data	  of	  TIM	  and	  tourism	   	  
The data collected by TIM’s mobile network – in full compliance with the privacy and regulatory context – are transformed into 
value that is useful to businesses, government offices and citizens, thanks to advanced analytic s, which are applied to the 
presence and flows of people across the country. 
By correlating the customer’s location (with an error of less than ten metres) with the CRM data (customer segment) and socia l 
media data (interest), new services can be provided for: 
•  businesses, such as : 
ü  targeted positioning of digital advertising in the areas of towns and cities that receive the most traffic and/or that are 
most frequented by the target public;  
ü  geomarketing campaigns and proximity services;  
ü  interaction of competing retailers in close proximity. Assessment of the commercial potential of a store to be purchased or rented;  
•  government bodies, i.e.:  
ü  monitoring movements of local population and visitors to optimise transport, urban mobility and security;  
ü  planning for crowds of visitors, movement of people during events, tourists itineraries;  
ü  identifying areas that are less visited with a view to expanding the tourism offer;  
•  customers, i.e.:  
ü  proximity services related to location;  
ü  customised offers; 
ü  information on event s in the area.  
In 2017, together with the municipality in Venice, TIM experimented with combining a new network service (MDT), enabling 
mobile devices to send performance data accompanied by GPS coordinates (if active on the device) every five seconds with  big 
data technology.

The testing was carried out in the area of Venice during carnival and focused on:  
•  the mobility of TIM customers in the target areas to analyse the trends of presence, paths covered, socio -demographic 
distribution and correlation with social media;  
•  the origins of foreign tourists and traffic at points of interest.   
Mobility	  services	  and	  intelligent	  transport	  Systems	   	  
Mobility services and intelligent transport Systems  
Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) use technology that enables vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, with street signs 
and with infrastructures along the road, as well as with other road users. The systems are also known as vehicle -to-vehicle 
(V2V) communication or vehicle -to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.  
The main concept is that the "Connected Vehicles" (cars, lorries, bus, etc.) become part of a fully connected hybrid 
communication system, which includes smart road infrastructure, distributed sensors and private and public control centres. 
Each node of t his extensive network is able to dynamically exchange data and information with the other nodes, thereby 
creating a distributed cooperative environment which is considered to be the main activator of a wide range of innovative ICT  
services for local government bodies, mobility -related businesses and end -users.  
By processing and analysing a greater amount of available data and information (including hazard data), these systems have 
great potential for improving road safety and road transport efficiency. Base d on these expected benefits, and considering the 
relatively low overall development costs, there is great interest in this sector to finalise the production of services.  
URBeLOG	  (URBan	  Electronic	  LOGistics) 	  
It is a project financed by the MIUR (Ministry f or Education, University and Scientific Research) as part of “Smart Cities”, involving 
Iveco, TIM, TNT and the Temporary Association of Companies (ATI) comprised of: FIT, Italdata and TEMA, Polytechnic of Turin, 
Bocconi University and Scuola Superiore Sant 'Anna. The aim is the distribution of goods over the “last mile” and the project 
seeks to propose new process methods and an open and integrated ICT environment of reference that allows all stakeholders to 
interact efficiently, minimizing the environmental  impact. TIM has helped to develop an open and cooperative multi -sided 
platform 1 and an innovative layer of middleware 2 capable of managing all the information available arriving from various 
sources (in -the-field devices, vehicles, fleet management system s, traffic management legacy systems 3, etc.).  
URBeLOG solutions were tested in 2017 as part of two testing areas in the cities of Milan and Turin in order to assess the va lidity of 
the proposed approach.

National	  Pilot	  	  eCall	   -­‐	  	  I_HeERO	  project	  
The publi c service for vehicle emergency calls to a single emergency number E112 (eCall) will be operational in all EU Member 
States for all new models of cars registered and produced from March 2018; these vehicles must be natively equipped with a 
mobile network modem capable of automatically calling the emergency number in the event of an accident. All mobile network 
operators must update their networks so they are capable of correctly processing and routing the incoming eCall to the first level PSAP (Public Safet y Answering Point) identified at national level.  
The pilot phases are co -financed by the European project I_HeERO; on the mobile and fixed network, TIM manages the 
technology by providing calls characterised by the e_Call flag in the areas identified for testing: the geographical area of the province of Varese (2016) and the length of the Brenner motorway under the territorial jurisdiction of the province of Trento 
(2017). Some radio base equipment of the areas identified was adapted along with the respective components of the core fixed 
and mobile networ k of Lombardy and the provinces of Trento and Bolzano.  
	  
MOBiNET	  (Europe -­‐Wide	  Platform	  for	  Connected	  Mobility) 	  
The project is financed by the European Union and aims to finalise the development of a distributed pre -operational framework 
at EU level (using c loud technology), which can support an open ITS market to offer data (content) and new services 
(applications) by interfacing with legacy infrastructures and solutions. The stakeholders’ collaboration model is primarily B 2B2C 
(business to business to consu mer). As part of the project, field tests were carried out involving local authorities and/or their 
implementing organisations, which are responsible for managing mobility in the metropolitan areas and cities involved in the 
pre-operational pilot. In Italy , the testing was carried out in Turin in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, the results were analysed and the 
final platform was released. TIM has overseen the Italian pilot project (which ended in June 2017) and helped to develop the platform. The potential enginee ring of the various platform modules were analysed by the consortium companies.  
	  
AUTOPILOT	  (AUTOmated	  driving	  Progressed	  by	  Internet	  of	  Things,	  IoT) 	  
The overall aim of the project – financed by the European Union – is to develop IoT platforms and architect ure to support 
automated guides by integrating the knowledge and technologies of the automotive industry and IoT .  
The project plans to conduct field testing of the solutions developed around five “pilots” in the various European countries 
involved and in South Korea.  TIM is participating in the Italian pilot (port area of Livorno and Florence -Livorno motorway), 
providing the connectivity and OneM2M (Machine -to-Machine) platform for data collection. TIM is also involved in specifying the 
communication requ irements and standardisation aspects. In 2017, documents were drawn up outlining the communication 
requirements for the project and standardisation plan. The use cases of the Italian pilot were established and the request for the 
ICON/oneM2M platform was p repared.

The world’s population is expected to grow up to 9.8 million in 2050, and the demand of agricultural products will double whi le 
natural resources will become scarcer. The development of Precision Agriculture will play a critical role in supporting the 
agribusiness sector.  
Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) will help farms optimize their activities, thus reducing costs and environmental impact s 
without jeopardizing product quality . 
Olivetti’s loT Smart Farm is a solution (running on a cloud platform) that provides farms with a complete set of instruments and 
information for keeping a close check – conveniently from a PC or tablet – on factors determining plant health, irrigation ne eds 
or weather conditions.  
Olivetti is also developing another Smart Agriculture solution: self -driving agricultural vehicles are being tested which take 
advantage of 5G capabilities, that can travel some distances in a fully autonomous way and carry out some agricultural tasks. 
Farmers will thus be able to remotely control self -driving tractors (using a tablet) planning their tasks and monitoring more than 
one vehicle at the same time, and this solution can help to improve productivity and contribute to waste reduction.

THE SUPPLY CHAIN  
[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach]  [GRI 414] The 2017 materiality matrix identified sustainability throughout the supply 
chain as topics for TIM.  
Digital represents the new collective progress factor, offering new opportunities that impact the economy and society in 
different ways. Suppliers have a direct influence on the communities and in the areas within which they go about their activi ties 
and, last but not least, the involvement of the organisations that monitor the related social and environmental aspects, must be 
considered.  
[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach]  [GRI 308] [GRI 414]  The procurement process adopted by the TIM Group is based on 
the competitive comparison of the technical and economic characteristics o f the offers presented by the selected suppliers, 
based on corporate procedures that comply with business ethics.  
The selection of the TIM Group’s suppliers involves a pre -contractual qualification stage in which the economic/financial and 
technical/organi sational characteristics are assessed. If the result of this assessment - which also includes consideration of the 
business ethics and respect for Human Rights, workers’ rights and the environment - is positive, the suppliers are registered on 
the Group Su pplier Database.  
Products and services are acquired at the best market conditions and must meet specific requirements of functionality, qualit y, 
safety and respect for the environment, in complete compliance with current laws and legislation.  
[GRI 412 -3] In all the contracts signed, there is a specific clause which makes it mandatory for the supplier to accept the 
principles expressed in the Group's Code of Ethics and Conduct1. 
[GRI 412 -3] As regards the domestic operations, the Italian suppliers on the dat abase with considerable value (the threshold is 
3,000 euros cumulative per year) receive2 initial screening in relation to respect for the principles of the Code of Ethics and are 
subject to regular assessment. The actions taken by TIM to verify suppliers varies depending on the riskiness of the supplier and 
the value of the purchase, ranging from simple to complex questionnaires and document checks to specific audits on sustainability matters.  
                                                                    
1 [GRI 103 -2: Management Approach ] [GRI 401] The Group Code of Ethics (CE) reads: “Compliance with the Code must also be guaranteed by external 
collaborators and, where envisaged in the company procedural system, by third parties that do business with the Group”. In pa rticular, the internal 
procedures require suppliers to accept the pri nciples laid down by the CE and contracts for temporary consortia or corporate investments to contain 
clauses for safeguarding the Organisational Model 231 (which is based on the CE). The UN Global Compact is, on the matter of Human Rights, the point of 
reference of the Group’s CE, which reads: “TIM has signed up to the United Nations’ Global Compact on Human Rights, work standa rds, environmental 
protection and the fight against corruption, and ensures that this institutional commitment is fully implemented  by undertaking regular initiatives on 
environmental and social issues”. The CE also contains specific clauses on the prohibition of discrimination, intimidation, c orruption and the protection of 
health and safety. Moreover, the Group policy on respect for  Human Rights specifies that “Fundamental Human Rights (e.g. working hours, fair 
remuneration, minimum age for starting work, workplace conditions, accessibility to the disabled, protection of maternity, pr ohibition of harassment, 
forced/compulsory/restric ted labour)” and “rights regarding health and safety (we consider the high standards of health and safety as a milestone of o ur 
success and our aim is to minimise injuries and occupational illnesses)” must be guaranteed for both the people of the Group and the human resources of 
suppliers

[GRI 414 -1] Specifically, in 2017 100% of new suppliers enrolle d in the Register signed a specific questionnaire in which they 
undertook for themselves and for any authorised subcontractors, collaborators and employees to observe the principles of 
behaviour contained in the Group’s Code of Ethics and Conduct1. 
While t he supply is taking place, registered companies which have received purchase orders normally undergo incoming quality 
control checks (a requirement for the acceptance and use of the purchased goods) and monitoring of the vendor rating. Environmental and so cial checks are also carried out
2. 
The purchasing departments focus on specific sectors, so as to provide accurate responses to the requirements of internal 
customers and stakeholders.  
[GRI 102 -9] TIM's purchases are made principally in the two geographical area where the Group's major operations are sited:  
Italy and Brazil, and are directed for the most part towards the following categories of products/services:  
•  telecommunications networks,  
•  telecommunications products,  
•  information technology,  
•  technical and professional services,  
•  power systems,  
•  other.  
[GRI 102 -9] In total, 5,096 suppliers received purchase orders from the Group in 2017 (- 8% compared with 2016 and -23% 
compared with 2015), including 4,002 for the Domestic BU3 (-3% compared with 2016 and +1 0% compared with 2015), 1,097 for 
Brazil ( -23% compared with 2016 and -41% compared with 2015)4. 
[GRI 102 -9] For some sectors, the Group also measures and monitors subcontracting suppliers , in particular, for network jobs ; 
there were 930 subcontracting bus inesses (+5% compared with 2016 and +14% compared with 2015).  In this sector, therefore, 
the estimated total number of suppliers involved in the supply chain is 9565. 
[GRI102 -10] In the last three years no significant changes have occurred in the structure of the Group’s supply chain.  
 
 
Sustainability initiatives 
In 2017, the process that defines activities aimed at improving the sustainability of the supply chain continued to be applie d. 
These activities involve the qualification, incoming quality and vendor rating stages.  
                                                                    
1 In Brazil such percentage was 94%.  
2 [GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 414] [GRI 308]   In particular, checks are envisaged on health and safety and the environment, the result of 
which goes towards forming the supplier rating, to which the system of penalties/incentives is connected.  Checks are also envisaged in relation to respect 
for employment legislation  
3 For the year in question, BU Domestic suppliers also included those of Perside ra and Olivetti  
4 The sum of the two addenda differs from the total because some suppliers received purchase orders both from the Domestic BU a nd the Brazil BU

[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach ] [GRI 414] In particular, the suppliers were classified according to the potential risks 
associated with their sustainability performance, carried out using a specific method that considers the social -environmental 
and business continuity aspects associated with the procurement markets in which they operate. For this reason, the 
procurement markets (i.e. procurement categories homogeneous among themselves) have been classified in accordance with 
parameters such as:  
•  the geographical areas of reference and the risks connected with them, 
•  the potential impact on the environment and on the society of the suppliers' activities and of the products/services supplied  
throughout their entire life cycle, including risks relating to violations of Human Rights, employment and environmental,  
•  the impact on the reputation of TIM as a customer.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 308] [GRI 414] A matrix has therefore been created which, by relating the 
spending associat ed with the specific purchase market to the risk index calculated on the basis of the parameters listed, has 
allowed purchase markets to be divided into four classes, identifying those most critical from the point of view of sustainab ility 
and economic impact. Suppliers belonging to the classes at greatest risk are the subject of sustainability audits carried out by 
third party companies specialising in the sector. These audits are repeated periodically to monitor the implementation of any  
corrective action s and, if the results are positive, to verify that the standard of performance found is being maintained. The tools 
developed and used for the Domestic BU have been explained and transferred to the Brazil BU.  
[GRI 308 -1] [GRI 407- 1] [GRI 408 -1] [GRI 409 -1] [GRI 414 -2] All suppliers of the Domestic BU have been assessed to 
consider the social/environmental risk1; in 2017, 51 were considered to be at greatest risk (+6% compared with 2016 and + 28% 
compared with 2015).  20 purchase markets2 and suppliers operat ing in the following geographical areas are considered to be at 
greatest social risk: Asia, Central and South America, North Africa and Eastern Europe.  
[GRI 410 -1] For the employees of organisations which supply security guard services in Italy, the Consol idated Law on Public 
Security must be complied with, in particular article 138, subsection 2, which specifies the professional and training requir ements 
of sworn guards. In Brazil, law 7102/83 establishes the rules relating to private security. It requires  all those intending to be hired 
as security guards for a security business to have attended a training course, delivered by schools accredited by the Federal  
Police. After hiring, once every two years the guards must attend an update course.  
[GRI 103 -2: M anagement Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] Since 2014, all suppliers interested in a qualification process (new, 
extension, renewal), relating to areas of procurement that present the greatest risk in terms of sustainability answer a spec ific 
self-assessment questionnaire to determine the socio -environmental sustainability risk.  Periodically updated based on the 
results and evolution of the qualification process, the questionnaire was developed according to the main requirements of the  
                                                                    
1 [GRI 103 -2: Management Approach] [GRI 407]  The Group policy aimed at preventing the risk of violation of trade union rights is that relating to 
“Relations with Suppliers in the TIM procurement process”, which reads:  “...the Group demands of its suppliers and promotes, through them, and 
including with regards to sub -suppliers, respect for the following principles and provisions of law in force in the countries where these stakeholders 
operate. … all workers must enjoy  the legal right to establish and/or subscribe to trade union organisations to protect the individual and collective 
interests. The role of the workers’ trade union representatives must be acknowledged, and they must not be subject to any for m of discrimination; in 
order to go about their union activities, they must be guaranteed remunerated permits and the means necessary to communicate with the workers on 
the workplace”. The same concepts are also stressed in the Group’s policy on respect for Human Rights

environment (including SA 8000, UN Global Compact and ISO 14001) and to the best industry practices.  
[GRI 414 -1] [GRI 308 -1] The self -assessment sustainability questionnaire is integrated into the application that handles the 
supplier qualification process, which automatically extended it to all new suppliers operating in markets where sustainabilit y is 
considered to be at risk. Refresher campaigns were mounted f or suppliers previously qualified in TIM's Register of suppliers. The 
results of the questionnaire will make it possible to refine the risk matrix described above.  
Brazil 
[GRI 414 -1] [GRI 414 -2] In 2017, a self- assessment questionnaire was sent out in Bra zil on matters of sustainability to suppliers 
whose orders exceeded one million reais, thereby involving 38% of the total number of suppliers. As of September 2017, replie s 
had been received from all the 629 suppliers involved. The results will help direct  future selection processes.  
[GRI 308 -1] The application of the green procurement policy, which contains guidelines for establishing the environmental 
requirements of products/services purchased, continues to be an integral part of the procurement policy. The policy covers all 
stages of the product life: design, production, use and end of life. Published on the "Vendors Hub" supplier portal of TIM an d in 
the sustainability section of the telecomitalia.com website, the document helps to orient purchasing pol icies towards low 
environmental impact products and services.  
 
Sustainability checks 
[GRI 103 -3: Management  Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414]  Activities intended to verify the sustainability performance level of 
common suppliers and sub -suppliers continued in 2017 in the framework of the Joint Audit Cooperation1 (JAC) initiative, in 
accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding signed at the end of 2009 by TIM, Orange and Deutsche Telekom. In 2011, 
Proximus, KPN, Swisscom and Vodafone Group signed up to the memorandum, followed by Telenor and Telia Company in 2012, 
Verizon in 2013 and AT&T, Telefónica and Rogers in 2016.  
The purposes of the Joint Audit Cooperation initiative are: 
•  to verify the sustainability of the most important suppliers/sub -suppliers that are common to the members of the JAC, with 
production plants located in geographical areas with a significant degree of socio -environmental risk. The checks are carried 
out by means of audits conducted by Third parties using a specific method developed by the JAC members themselves, who 
share the results of the verifications;  
•  to contribute to the increased sustainability of suppliers/sub -suppliers involved by devising and implementing corrective 
actions and ongoing improvement programmes, establishing long -lasting and mutually beneficial cooperation with them in 
terms of efficiency, productivity and risk reduction in the supply chain;  
•  to perform capacity building activities, through specific supplier training programmes, particularly in order to disseminate a 
culture of sustainability throughout the supply chain (sub -suppliers and sub -sub-suppliers).

[GRI 308 -2] [GRI 407 -1] [GRI 408 -1] [GRI 409- 1] [GRI 414 -2] Between 2010 and 2017, thanks to the gradual increase in the 
number of members of JAC, 366 audits were carried out – including 89 in 20171 alone - in production plants (suppliers and sub -
suppliers) located in Asia, Central and South America, North Africa and Eastern Europe. The checks were carried out through 
international specialised companies selected b y competitive tender and related to a total of more than 816,000 workers. The 
suppliers included in the audit campaign belonged to the user devices and appliances, network appliances and IT equipment production sectors.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 308] [GRI 414] The table below shows the non -conformities recorded during

[GRI 308 -2] [GRI 414 -2] For all the non -conformities encountered, specific corrective action plans were drawn up that 
established resolution procedures and timetables amongst others. The implementation of these plans is monitored on a 
constant basis by the JAC members3. On 11 January 2017, Xi’an (China) hosted the sixth annual forum with suppliers involved in 
the JAC programme, on th e subject of: “Sharing best practices tools and challenges for a sustainable supply chain, today and in 
the future”.  The event was attended by 133 delegates, representing TLC operators, suppliers, members of the press, 
organisations operating in sustainability and NGOs.

The Forum was also attended remotely, via live streaming, recording a maximum peak of active connections of around 1,400.  
 
Supplier involvement initiatives  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI  308] [GRI 414] Use of the suppliers' portal (Vendors Hub), launched at the end of 
2011 to improve communication and optimise operational processes by applying social networking systems to the business 
context, is now well established. The Portal has around 3,900 vendors enabled to use the application p latform. The portal allows 
suppliers to access a private area to view important data and events connected to their relationship with TIM and manage all 
their own details, thus improving the smooth operation and transparency. The Vendors Hub also includes a  public area 
containing information for potential suppliers.  
Documentation is exchanged electronically (e.g. offers, purchase orders, contracts, qualification documentation, surveys), 
reducing the environmental impact resulting from the use of paper, transporting and storing documents.

128 [GRI 103 -1: Management Approach]  [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412 ] The materiality 
analysis, conducted by TIM in 2017, confirmed the protection of Human Rights as a material topic for stakeholders and for the 
Group, along the entire “value chain”. This result, which may seem surprising for a telecommunications operator that works in  
Countries considered to be at low/medium risk of Human Rights violations, is based on two sets of reasons : 
•  the broad meaning TIM assigns to the concept of “Human Right”. This sphere includes not only basic Human Rights 
common to all economic sectors, such as the right to fair remuneration, non -discrimination, the right to not resort to 
forced and/or compulsor y work, etc., but also Human Rights specific to a telecommunications company, such as the right 
to access information, freedom of expression (in particular online), protection of privacy and safety online, and protection 
of minors (from cyberbullying, for example);  
•  the public outcry caused by Human Rights violation incidents, which can seriously affect business reputation.  
  
TIM's Undertakings   
 [GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] TIM signed up to the 
Global Compact in 2002; between 2008 and 2011, TIM was a member of the UN Global Compact Human Rights Working Group 
set up by the Global Compact Board in 2006 with the aim of providing Global Compact with a strategic Human Rights input.  
From 2012 TIM was one of the members de "The Human Rights Peer Learning Group" (PLG), consisting in the context of the 
Global Compact Network Germany with the support "technical" of Twentyfifty Ltd1. The eleven companies, which accounted for 
PLG in 2017, participated direct ly in the selection, preparation and presentation to the topics discussed (good practice, joint 
analysis, lessons learned), with the contribution of input and external experts. The main activities of 2017 were as follows:  
•  meeting of March: "The due diligen ce on the modern slavery - answers to the new expectations of law and stakeholders";  
•  webinar in M ay: "Integration of the due diligence Human Rights into human resource management";  
•  meeting of September: "Integration of the due diligence of Human Rights through the global activities". At the meeting, 
hosted by Relx Group (London), participated some members of the Global Compact Network british, italian, spanish, and 
german;  
•  webinar  in December:  "Access to remedy in practice - Updates from Forum on business and Human Rights of the UN".  
 
In recent years, in order to strengthen its commitment to the protection of Human Rights, TIM has implemented, inter alia (th e 
relative details are given in the following paragraphs): 
•  Human Rights Due Diligence;  
•  the “Respecting Human Rights in the TIM Group” policy;  
•  information and training on Human Rights.

Due Diligence  
 [GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] As of 2012, TIM has 
been involved in the Company Coaching and Capacity Assessment on Business and Human Rights, organised by Global 
Compact Network Germany, as part of which the OCAI1 for Human Rights due diligence in companies was also explained 
(expressly required by the UN “Gui ding Principles on Business and Human Rights”). The OCAI is a self -assessment questionnaire 
which fully reflects the content of the aforementioned “Guiding Principles”, made up of twenty -two questions concerning the 
main elements of corporate responsibilit y for Human Rights2.  
The goals of the due diligence include:  
•  the identification and mapping of Human Rights risks resulting from the company's operations3; 
                                                                    
1 Organisational Capacity Assessment Instrument, created by Twe ntyfifty Ltd. with funding from the Global Compact Network Germany Foundation.  
2 The questions asked by the instrument:  
reflect the interpretations provided by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights;  
focus on the main elements outlined by  the “Guiding Principles” (four questions concern the Human Rights policies that may be in place, four concern 
assessments of company activities that have an impact – actual and/or potential – on Human Rights, eleven concern the integration of respect for 
Human Rights in company activities, two concern tracing the company's response to the negative impacts it has caused and comm unication of the 
Human Rights performance, and the last question concerns the reporting mechanisms in place at the company in the e vent of Human Rights violation). 
TIM has not considered the question relating to conflict -affected areas as the Group does not operate in any such contexts. In completing the OCAI, for 
each question, the company/department assesses its own position, curren t and potential, on a spectrum of six levels that range from “non -responsive” to 
"Human Rights promoter". The two lowest levels identify a reactive approach to Human Rights ("non -responsive" and "reactive" respectively), the third is 
an active approach ("e fficient management"), the three higher levels represent a proactive approach to Human Rights (rising from "proactive 
experimentation" to "strategic integration" and finally "Human Rights promoter")  
The tool does not operate as a compliance expert  
3 The company’s operational activities include the supply chain. Among the groups deemed vulnerable, in addition to children, women,  the elderly, 
disabled people and local communities, TIM has identified indigenous people and migrants' work    TIM Sustainability Report 2017

management system that regularly monitors and traces the performances (if possible through appropriate indicators, such 
as those concerning health and safety), and that the relative responsibilities have been assigned; 
•  the definition of a gradual improvement path which, starting with simple respect for the local laws, guides the policies and 
processes of Human Rights towards sharing with the appropriate stakeholders through appropriate involvement initiatives;  
•  the highlighting of any gaps or inconsistencies between the company's various departments and/or between the different 
companies of the Group;  
•  the possibility to discuss Human Rights with the other companies.  
 
[GRI 412 -1] TIM carried out the first internal due diligence on Human Rights from autumn 2012 to spring 2014, on the basis of 
the “Guiding Principles”, the use of the OCAI questionnaire, and the involvement of the Group's two biggest entities in terms  of 
workforce (the percentage of employees covered was 98%) and investments: Do mestic BU (excluding Olivetti and TIM Sparkle) 
and the Brazil BU. The entire due diligence process has been studied and coordinated by the SRMR (Sustainability Reporting, 
Monitoring and Relationship) Department, which invited the Group’s departments1 and companies to fill in the self -assessment 
questionnaire . The SRMR Department examined the questionnaires that had been filled in and conducted the related feedback 
with the Italian departments in order to further examine the contributions provided and define  the action plans for the level two 
and three self -assessments (respectively 3.1% and 8.6% of all the responses )2. 
In fact, while the self- assessment process revealed a potential risk situation with reference to Human Rights, the Department 
concerned trans mitted the corresponding action plan to the SRMR Department, which monitored the progress achieved in the work.  
In Italy, at the end of the feedback, the following emerged:  
•  on a scale of one to six, the average score of all the answers was 4.4;  
•  the need t o prepare the TIM Group's Human Rights policy (around 2/3 of the insufficient self -assessments regarded this 
aspect);  
•  the usefulness of organising internal Human Rights training courses; 
•  In 2018, due diligence on Human Rights is planned; this will concern Olivetti and TIM Sparkle, bringing the percentage of staff 
and investments of the Domestic BU close to 100%.  
[GRI 412 -2]  In Brazil, dissemination of the online information and training course launched at the end of 2017 should have a 
positive effect on the results of the due diligence itself, planned for 2018.

131 THE COMMITTMENT TO RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] The Policy applies to 
every individual within the Group and also concerns Third Parties who have business dealings with TIM.  
The purpose of the Policy, issued in 20151, is to make respect for Human Rights an essential requirement in the performan ce of 
TIM’s operational activities. Both in Italy and in foreign companies, thanks to the Human Rights due diligence too, the Group  has 
set up processes through which it undertakes to respect Human Rights and has identified those that may be negatively 
influenced by the Company's activities, such as:  
•  [GRI 408 -1] [GRI 409 -1] Essential Human Rights (e.g. working hours, equal pay, minimum age to enter the world of work, 
accessibility for disabled people, maternity protection, forced/compulsory/restricted work) ; 
•  [GRI 403 -3] health and safety rights;  
•  [GRI 407 -1] rights agreed with the unions and included in National Labour Agreements (in line with the principles of the 
International Labour Organization);  
•  [GRI 406 -1] rights concerning diversity, equality and non- discrimination.  
The Group’s internal processes also focus on a series of individual rights affected by the core business, including the right s: 
•  associated with access to telecommunications services and innovation;  
•  associated with the privacy of the Group’s people, customers and suppliers, and the protection of their personal data;  
•  associated with freedom of expression, in particular online, supported by access to telecommunications technologies; 
•  deriving from the company's zero tolerance approach to an y form of corruption;  
•  potentially violated by added value services (for example, services with content reserved for adults and gambling);  
•  of children and young people to be protected from (cyber)bullying or harassment;  
•  of our customers concerning responsible advertising;  
•  associated with environmental protection (in particular electromagnetic fields);  
•  of the communities in which TIM carries out business, with particular attention to vulnerable groups of people (e.g., disable d 
people, minors, the elderly, women);  
•  associated with the use of armed security in accordance with the highest standards and international practices and with the 
highest transparency possible. 
The Policy sets out the unfiltered and anonymous reporting mechanisms in line with the requirements of the company 
procedures, available on the Group's website.

[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] Following the 
publication of the Policy, in 2 015 a classroom training course was organized and attended by representatives of the various 
company departments. The course was run by an external company with expertise in sustainability issues1 and was attended by 
the Director General of Amnesty International Italia.  Moreover, an online course was created for everyone in the company, 
available from the end of 2015 on  intranet. The course is currently available on the TIM Academy e- learning platform; further 
voluntary participation invitations were sent out in 2016 and 2017, the year the course was also made available in Brazil - in the 
local language and on an experimental basis - to some company departments.  
Both the workshop and the online course highlighted, among other things: 
•  what Human Rights are and the main international Institutions that govern them;  
•  businesses and Human Rights, focusing on any impacts their activities may have on Human Rights;  
•  the importance of businesses that operate in the telecommunications industry in the defence of Human R ights: 
•  TIM and Human Rights: what can be done - in the case of doubt - by individuals of the Group for the protection of Human 
Rights;  
•  how and when to use the reporting mechanism.  
[GRI 412 -2] The online course on respect for Human Rights was also offered to all BU Domestic employees in 2017, in 
connection with the publication of the Group policy on the Respect for Human Rights. The training activities mainly concerned  
the dissemination of the Group’s Policy for the Respect of Human Rights and observance of  occupational Health and Safety

[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412 ] The Group's Code of 
Ethics and Conduct requires employees, collaborators, consultants, as well as third parties who have business relations with the 
Group and all the stakeholders affected by the Human Rights Policy - in respe ct of activities and services of interest to the Group 
- to promptly inform the Head of the TIM Audit Department, either directly or via their line manager, of any violations or 
collusion to violate:  
•  legal or regulatory requirements,  
•  provisions of the Code  of Ethics,  
•  policy and internal procedures  
and any irregularities and/or negligence.  
The handling of reports, including those for which the Head of the Audit Department is responsible (known as “whistleblowing” ), 
is a requirement of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act  and of the “UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights”. 
The “Whistleblowing” procedure requires the Head of the Audit Department, who answers directly to the Board of Directors, 
independently of the senior executives:  
•  to ensure that incoming comp laints are received, logged and undergo preliminary analysis;  
•  based on the results of the preliminary analysis, to launch a structured audit activity (if required);  
•  to communicate the results of the analyses to the relevant departments so that they may tak e the appropriate corrective 
actions (if required). The non -compliance is only closed once the Audit Department has verified the effectiveness of the 
corrective actions implemented by the relevant departments;  
•  to ensure the traceability and retention of th e documentation regarding the complaints received and their analysis;  
•  to update the reporting procedure and disseminate it in agreement with the Human Resources & Organisational Development department.  
The whistleblowing

[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach]  [GRI 401]  The materiality analysis TIM conducted in 2017 confirmed that both the 
stakeholders and the Company consider the management of the workforce and the development of internal employment, in 
addition to the health and safety of workers, as material topics for the whole Group.  
The telecommunications sector is marked by rapid evolution due to the concomitant action of various factors, including: the 
technological adaptation of infrastructures, changing styles of customer consumption and the convergence process underway. 
In this context, people’s abilities to adapt and manage change become an obligation; new business models shaped by the digitisation of processes and services in fact require the continuous updating of technical -behavioural skill sets and working 
styles.  
To take on the challenge of the future, TIM needs to employ people capable of achievi ng results quickly and interpreting a 
model marked by continuous learning, operational and methodological flexibility and an innovative approach to problem 
solving.  
In this scenario, TIM is a knowledge company with technological and market leadership thanks to the expertise and skills possessed by its people, where the differences and sharing of knowledge represent added value to achieve the set business 
objectives. Everyone who works at TIM is personally committed through their work to laying the foundations for a Company that 
believes in the responsibility of each member and the contribution of all to achieve the company objectives, contributing eve r 
more to the deve lopment of telecommunications in the countries it works in.  
TIM is strongly committed to defining a complex set of tools and services designed to enhance and motivate the Company's 
resources, as well as satisfy the needs of customers and shareholders, ther eby creating greater wealth for all players involved. 
An effective human resources management strategy reconciles external stakeholders’ needs with those of employees and takes shape through reciprocity between what workers receive and the value services t hey provide.  
At TIM, the enhancement of human capital serves to achieve the business aims through its human resources activities, which 
are described in the following paragraphs and always implemented in full compliance with the reference policy.

[GRI 1 03-2: Management Approach]  [GRI 401]  The Head of the Human Resources & Development Department is appointed

(*) number of accidents per million hours worked 
Given the above, in Italy 2017 was characterized by significant action towards safeguarding employment and retraining 
employees, which is considered a priority. A series of actions were taken in this respect, starting with the introduction of 
structured tr aining courses for professional retraining, which allowed the sectors with the greatest impact on the business to be 
strengthened and the internal market of the Group's professional skills to be enhanced.   
TIM’s Development Model for people was conceived as an integrated system of processes aimed at enhancing the entire 
company population in relation to the specific characteristics, experiences and potential of each person. The Model intends t o 
pursue the growth of skills to increase people’s value in thei r daily work activities (“long life learning”), the enhancement of 
excellence to support the capacity to innovate, and professional and managerial growth.  
On the topic of learning, TIM Academy, with the new digital platform, in synergy with knowledge manag ement activities and in 
close integration with the innovation and research departments, enables digital learning, a new way of supporting the 
Educational Model and the skills requirement. TIM Academy is in fact involved in scouting and monitoring the new p rofessions 
and skills, their introduction and first internal use, and in large -scale consolidation and subsequent updates.  
Welfare  
This is in addition to the Welfare Model which combines tradition and future with specific strategic and organizational awar eness, which places welfare at the heart of the Human Resources strategy, enabling the use of services and initiatives 
aimed at encouraging company, family and social sustainability.  
All this is supported by partnerships with the academic and educational w orld designed and implemented to encourage cross 
fertilisation and the development of employer branding through the enhancement of internal skills and careers advice for 
students in line with digital skills.  
The strategy aimed at Human Resource is therefor e strongly focused on the caring of people which revolves around the 
following three key points: 
•  Safety Management System  
•  Equity and Inclusion  
•  Professional Retraining  
TIM's Safety Management System Model involves the full involvement of all players that participate in the security process: 
company management, operational coordination figures, appointed doctors, workers and Workers’ Safety Representatives (WSR).  
With re ference to the latter, the corporate relationship model in terms of safety, which has always been based on participation 
logic, includes over 100 specific figures who support 5 Committees made up of a mix of company/trade union members with 
specific workers’ health and safety functions.   TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
141 In this context, the specific "Health, Safety & Environment” (HSE) department supports Company organization in the 
management of health, safety and environmental issues by assessing risks and identifying the most appropriate  prevention and 
protection measures in line with technological development.  
The identification and assessment of risks found at the Company, which is the priority activity of the preventive actions, is  
ensured through constant oversight of company processes and their evolution in close connection with the management lines.  
These activities are performed by specialized internal resources capable of conducting instrumental analyses and surveys on 
safety in the workplace (for example, high and low frequency electromagnetic fields, noise, vibrations, natural radioactivity, 
lighting, micro -climate, manual handling of loads).  
The control measures applied to eliminate or contain the risks include:  
•  the numerous health and safety training programmes, differentiated according to the risks and professional profiles found at 
the Company;  
•  the latest generation protection and/or collective equipment and devices often designed ad- hoc in collaboration with the 
most important multi -nationals on the market;  
•  any organizational arrangements necessary, implemented in collaboration with the lines, which can guarantee an 
acceptable level of risk, where it cannot be eliminated.  
From the perspective of encouraging dialogue and promoting the prevention culture, even at the most operational levels 
dedicated meetings are also promoted – “safety moments ” -  at which technical experts and coordinators, supported by HSE 
personnel, discuss and explore the most topical issues and share any proposals for improvements.  
The most significant performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of the actions adopted include the outcomes of the accidents analysis, which generates improvement plans defined on the basis of the causes that led to the events and that can 
lead to the updating of the C ompany's risk assessment.  
Workers’ safety at TIM also includes the treatment of people and the implementation of solutions that place everyone in a 
position to give the best of themselves, concepts underlying economic and social sustainability.  
The Welfare Model is therefore strongly focused on developing work ability  (a person's capacity to perform their work as best 
they can now and in the future, with respect to the demands of their job, regardless of their age) and engagement to support digital transformation at TIM.  
The model is based on two fundamental principles: individual needs and engagement of people/brand reputation, which positions the set of activities in 3 specific areas:  
•  caring: the set of services and initiatives to improve work/ life balance; 
•  transformation: projects to enable people to gain a more digital, flexible and simple vision of work; 
•  inclusion: activities to place everyone in a position to give the best of their potential, identifying personalized solutions  and 
recovering  blocked energies and unexpressed areas of productivity.  
Inclusion is therefore a key area, of TIM’s welfare system, but also the most challenging one, and it is no coincidence that it is 
also considered a profoundly identity -based and strategic lever. In fact, it clearly permeates all founding documents of the new 
organizational identity: from the Ethics Code to the Human Rights Policy and values.
   TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
142 TIM’s current position remains in the conceptual area of “Inclusion Management” as incorporating inclusion in to TIM’s DNA 
allows for direct action when processes, organizations and training moments are created rather than reasoning on a section by  
section basis.  
Inclusion plays a key role in knowing how to innovate the products and services offered; anticipating market needs actually 
means going beyond the limits often generated by work routines and habits to look at the activities, processes and people from 
a unique point of view.  
In 2017, TIM was included, as the only Italian Telco, in the Top 100 of Thomson Re uters’ Diversity and Inclusion Index.  
The index measures company performance and takes into consideration four areas: Diversity , People Development , Inclusion  
and News Controversies . Only companies that manage to obtain a positive vote in all four areas r eceive an overall score, 
calculated as the average score obtained in the different areas.  
TIM’s inclusion in the Diversity and Inclusion Index confirms the Group's commitment to equal opportunities, non -discrimination 
and inclusion as the basis of its com pany strategy to improve internal expertise, organizational well- being and therefore 
company performance.  
Moreover, scientific evidence demonstrates that the most diversified contexts, where there is a meeting/clash of cultures, 
lifestyles and generations,  are those with the highest capacity to generate innovation. [GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  
[GRI 404]  Therefore, TIM’s aim is to develop skills capable of encouraging inclusion in the company to increase the capacity for 
innovation. On this topic, in 201 6 a professional retraining service was launched called “Job Center,” which starts by identifying 
the company requirements and then goes on to recruit and offer training courses useful to people for the acquisition of the s kills 
and knowledge necessary to cover the new roles. Further information is available in the related paragraph of this chapter.  
 
Brazil  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach ] [GRI 401]  [GRI 40 2] [GRI 404 ] The TIM Group and its other stakeholders consider 
human capital to be one of the main assets. This is why TIM Participações has also put in place programmes designed to create 
and maintain a high -performing and diversified workforce and promote a healthy, safe and productive working environment for 
its personnel in order to maximise the pot ential of both individuals and the organization, and position TIM among employer 
brands. In addition to the Group’s Code of Ethics and Human Rights Policy, there are policies and processes to support these 
programmes such as, for example, Recruitment, Flex Office, Performance Management, Benefit Administration, Career & 
Succession Plan, Diversity & Inclusion and Rewarding procedures.  
TIM employees' involvement is essential in order to succeed in achieving the strategic vision: “to become the best supplier o f 
telecommunications services by exploiting our position as a leading operator in ultra -broadband and our smart offer”.  
Training and communication activities were taken to publicize the company objectives with clarity and transparency and to 
support manage rs in explaining the strategy to their respective teams.  
The Head of HR Strategy reports directly to the CEO of TIM Participações. The MBO targets for this role are linked to cost 
efficiency, working environment and corporate climate.  
In 2017, the organiza tional framework evolved to support the company strategy so it could contribute to the company objectives 
by promoting the activities of the residential users segment. As for the customer experience approach and cost and process 
efficiency, the project to redefine company processes set forth a set of actions to be implemented in order to obtain better 
results.   TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
143 To achieve the objectives and keep up with ongoing evolution, TIM needs leaders that share its values, expertise and intentio ns. 
In order to have lea dership that is more aligned with the strategy, TIM’s leadership profile was reviewed taking into account the 
attitudes and expertise for present and future company challenges. The profile was developed with the help of Top 
Management, as well as specializ ed external consultants, managers and employees.  
The aim of this initiative is to stimulate the People Management process to manage Recruitment, Training, Development, 
Assessment, Career & Succession and Culture.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 401]  Given the importance of the people who work for the Company, climate 
investigations are particularly significant. 91% of employees took part in the 2017 corporate climate survey, beating last ye ar’s 
participation by 4 percentage points. This demonstrates t he reliability of our survey and that the outcomes better fit the actual 
situation.  
The methodology identifies factors that influence employee involvement and organizational support – in that one leverages the 
other – to reflect the effectiveness of the c ompany's professional figures.  
The general degree of consensus in TIM Participações was 71%, marking a 9 percentage point improvement on last year.  
In line with the strategic pillar of Customer Experience, Customer Quality & Focus increased by 10 percentag e points on 2016. 
Autonomy & Empowerment, Clarity & Guidance and Trust in Leadership also showed significant improvements.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management  Approach ] [GRI 40 5] In 2017, seminars were held to increase knowledge and define the priorities 
with the Exec utive Committee. Moreover, second level managers were invited to participate in working groups and propose 
action plans for climate- related priorities: Development, How I Work, Trust in TIM, Customer Caring and Clarity & Targeting.  
Specific action plans to  improve the results in 2017 were provided for sectors that obtained the most critical results in 2016. 
Thanks to the targeted work, the level of consensus in these sectors increased.  
Diversity & Inclusion represents another very important aspect for the Company. TIM believes that diversity is a reflection of 
society and therefore of the employment market. The Company promotes a culture that respects and appreciates differences, 
in the conviction that the greater the diversity within a group the greater th e exchange of experiences and solutions that help to 
create a healthy working environment and a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  
As described in the Social Responsibility Policy1 , any expression or forms of discrimination are expressly prohibited, whether 
they are based on sexual orientation, ethnic origin, gender, disability, age or other things.  
As of 2017, everyone can put their preferred name (“social name”) on their company ID badge based on their gender identity. This request can be made regardless of whether it is officially recognized in the civil registry.  
To promote the inclusion of disabled people (pessoas com deficiência – PcD) in the Company, TIM continued the PcD 
programme ensuring that the available work positions are also open to  this population. A communication campaign invited staff 
to share their stories and dreams, revealing the diversity within the workforce. The company also participated in special job  fairs 
aimed towards disabled people and put a variety of measures in plac e to make its facilities accessible to these employees, 
quickly adapting interior spaces and pursuing awareness -building activities with managers and teams.

TIM PEOPLE  
 
144 In doing so, TIM has been able to increase the number of disabled people hired. In fact, with refer ence to the hiring quota 
percentage (5% of the total staff) established by the Conduct Adjustment Agreement (Portuguese acronym: TAC) signed with 
the Brazilian Prosecutor's Office (Law no. 8213/91), as of December 2017 TIM, having hired 21 disabled people out of a total of 
470, was compliant by 45% with respect to 28% in 2016.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 40 3] As regards Health & Safety issues, each year the Company leads the 
Environmental Risk Prevention Programme (PPRA), a study conducted at TIM’s Brazil offices through on -site safety inspections, 
identifying the risks and control measures. The aim of the Medical Occupational Health Control Program (PCMSO) is to indicate  
occupational health checks relating to any environmental risk conditions as a  prerequisite for monitoring workers’ health. All 
employees who perform activities with controlled risks are specifically trained for the position they hold. Moreover, an Inte rnal 
Accident Prevention Week (SIPAT) is held each year to raise awareness among employees on Health & Safety related aspects. 
The internal committee for the prevention of accidents at work (CIPA) is made up of company representatives and workers based in all the regional offices of TIM Participações, in line with the legal requirement s of the Order 3.214/78 - Regulatory 
Standard 5. With the support of CIPA, the company is setting up influenza vaccination campaigns, blood donation programmes and promoting the adoption of healthy habits amongst employees.  
In addition, periodic audits and /or inspections are performed to assess the effectiveness of the prevention measures in 
processes and workplaces set up to continuously improve health and safety conditions. The Health & Safety team is made up of 29 members, strategically distributed in the regional offices of TIM Participações.

the communities in which Group companies operate; furthermore, in reading the KPIs, note that:  
•  [GRI 102 -8] TIM does not use self -employed workers to go about its business activities, although it is possible that, on an 
occasional basis, some consultancy type activities may be entrusted to self -employed professionals;  
•  [GRI 102 -8] The Group's activities do not vary seasonally, hence changes in the workforce  are correctly shown by the 
annual trends;  
•  [GRI 401 -3a] All employees are entitled to parental leave.  
 
Gender balance  
[GRI 103 -1: Management  Approach ] [GRI 40 5] There is still a long way to go before true gender balance can be achieved in 
the telecommunications sector which, like all sectors where the main activity is strictly linked to the research and developm ent 
of new technologies, still continues to have a ma inly male workforce. As women have embraced the world of work and, in a 
parallel fashion, scientific and technological culture and studies, their presence has gradually grown within companies, seei ng 
them take on more important roles with higher salaries. In TIM S.p.A., for example, the female workforce has grown by around 
8% in 17 years, and on a Group level, in this same period, by around 9%.  
This is why  
•  at TIM the Bylaws require that the BoD, and likewise the Board of Statutory Auditors, is made up of b oth genders, so that the 
members of the less represented gender make up at least one third of the total number of Directors/Statutory Auditors, 
rounding up to the next unit in the event of a fraction;  
•  the current development model pays close attention to e nsuring that individual growth paths, starting from the time of 
employment, do not contain any restrictions relating to gender or age differences, and particular attention is paid to the female component, where skills and performance are equal.

The generational imbalance is mainly due to the Italian component that, due to adverse market conditions and in order to 
guarantee work for its employees, has in the past renounced the generational renewal comprising new important hiring 
campaigns.  
 
People Caring  
TIM believes that being an inclusive company, one that is able to take care of its people, to create solutions that put everyone in 
a position to give the best of themselves, is the basis for economic and social sustainabi lity. Therefore, over 2017, the following 
activities were carried out:  
Family and personal care  
Work -life balance is the first pillar of TIM’s welfare and is based on the belief that performance and organisational well -being 
are connected to each other and to the organisation of family and work life.  
This is why TIM, has established a range of services to help its people reduce their care- loads, based on a notion of family which 
includes all of the employee’s family members, irrespective of blood or legal ties. 
The main ones include: 23 daycare centres and 2 nursery schools at the company offices or external organisations; 39 "TIM 
Summer" campuses/camps/colleges for employees' children for a total of 6,262 participants; "Mum and Dad" permits for 
parents with children up to age 11, allowing them to use permits for a few hours or entire days to offset their absence within the given 3- month period; "Mum and Dad" loans for parents with children aged 0 to 11 to benefit from loans for up to a maximum 
of 2,500 euro s for each child. Moreover, they can access a wide programme of external organisations (around 200) via 2 e -
commerce portals customised for TIM, with discounts and offers on a wide range of products and services from the most prestigious brands and leading  companies, as well as complementary discount agreements with banks and financial 
institutions, pay -TV, car rentals, transport, sports services and service agencies.   TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
149 Transformation and simplification of work  
This is the second pillar of TIM’s welfare initiative, which is especially based on Agile Work, a project involving more than 10,000 
people which makes it possible to work from home or from a satellite office close to home. Another import area of action is Mobility Management, whereby TIM helps people t ravel from home to work and back by car pooling, company shuttle buses 
(296 trips per day to the company’s offices in 5 cities), bicycle racks at company offices (1,782 bicycle parking spaces in 2 9 cities 
and 60 company offices).  
Equity & Inclusion Manage ment  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 405]  [GRI 406] [GRI 103 -3: M anagement Approach]  [GRI 40 5] [GRI 40 6] [GRI 
405]  For years, TIM has been committed to promoting diversity and inclusion as key elements when building a culture of 
positive results, whe re people are encouraged to make the strongest contribution to meet the needs of customers whilst 
encountering diversity, drawing on innovation and a new way of thinking – all key factors in the digital transformation process.  
 
The main areas of development of TIM's Inclusion Management are:  
•  Cultural diffusion and awareness , through the TIM Equity &  Inclusion Week held in many locations and 18 cities from 11 to 
15 December 2017 with over 180 events; courses on "Human rights", on inclusion in general and disability management; a 
training course on "Giving value to diversity" - all courses available to everyone on the TIM Academy e -learning platform; the 
launch of the #TIM4inclusion community: over 200 TIM people committed to the spreading the culture of inclusion; the 
social network campaign #TIM4inclusion led during the TIM Equity & Inclusion Week from  11 to 15 December, with 5 Tweet 
Quotes and 2 FB posts; a specific reference to the issues of equity & inclusion in the key organisational identity documents:  
code of ethics, human rights policy, charter of values, leadership model.   
•  Disability management : at TIM, there are over 2,000 individuals with disabilities, accounting for around 4% of the workforce. 
The following have been made available for these colleagues to have a positive work day: the "Comunico -IO” project, which 
facilitates communication bet ween colleagues with sensory disabilities and the rest of the company (for deaf colleagues, for 
example, TIM offers the LIS interpretation service in the key moments of interaction between manager and employee, subtitles in main communications on the Intra net, specific e -mailboxes to allow them to communicate with main corporate 
services, as well as free video calling services and an integrated communication platform developed internally, which can be used both from smartphones and desktop computers); profe ssional retraining (the Deaf Database Project in Open Access, 
for example, made it possible to integrate 7 deaf people from TIM in the Databases Department, with support from a deaf 
tutor and hearing supervisor already included in the activity); development and research activities: by participating in 
research projects in partnership with universities on disability management, as well as our working capital accelerators, 
which host various start -ups dedicated to disability (such as Pedius, which offers a co mmunication service for deaf people); 
support for employees' children with disabilities during TIM Summer camps; the policy for automatically adapting fixed and mobile work stations for TIM individuals with disabilities, which has already been in effect si nce 2015 .  
•  Gender : for TIM, meritocracy is everyone’s development, regardless of gender: on this premise, TIM is working in partnership 
with Valore D, both as a supporting member and as a member of the Board of Directors. Because of this, more than 100 individuals a year have the opportunity to attend skill -building courses, mentoring and coaching programmes, as well as 
courses and workshops on welfare and work -life balance; TIM has also joined the Women's Employment Manifesto, a 
document whereby it is comm itted to 9 areas of activity; TIM operates through work -related learning to bring students into 
contact with a technologically -advanced company like TIM, participation in projects (such as Valore D's “InspiringGirls”) 
aimed at girls in particular to overco me the preconception that scientific and technological subjects are a prerogative 
exclusive to male students, and the organisation of the Girls Hackathon #TIMgirlshackathon.  
•  Longevity management
: in Italy, more than half of the Group’s people were born be tween 1960 and 1980. This figure 
increases in the area of Caring Services alone. We have therefore developed the awareness that we want to go beyond  TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
150 approaching the generational topic as a "confrontation between generations" and reach an understanding of working 
longevity that focuses on the physical, psychological and motivational well -being of our people. The "Longevity" project is a 
360° project that rethinks the company and its processes based on this same increase in longevity (from welfare services to 
a redesign of the system for developing and measuring potential, through to preparing an ad hoc training plan). The first 
part of the programme has just started, centred around Mindfulness as a tool for reducing occupational and no -
occupational stress a nd the ability to correctly channel and optimise our own resources.  
•  Sexual orientation and gender identity : thanks to the partnership with PARKS, Liberi e Uguali, of which TIM is a founding 
member and Board member, we have implemented TIM’s definition of "family", which extends all benefits granted to its 
employees (car, healthcare, supplementary insurance) to all cohabiting partners, regardless of gender, and grants the 
opportunity to access the company’s many care services (crèches, summer stays, study s tays) to the family nucleus of the 
employee regardless of the blood bond, and therefore also to homosexual families and their children); we officially took part  
in the 2017 Milan Pride Parade with 50 colleagues and brand exposure; the affinity group LGBT &  allies “TIM Rainbow” was 
launched and we have been participating in various conventions to relay TIM's experience on LGBT issues. 
•  Employee volunteering initiatives : these are an integral part of TIM's inclusion management programme, since they 
promote com ing together and improving listening and comprehension skills and, indeed, inclusion. The main activities 
include: 10 colleagues took part in Dynamo Camp Onlus during the "TIM Challenge" fundraising weekend; the TIM employee music group "TCC Band" has been  selected to perform at one of the Dynamo Rock Challenge evenings for Dynamo Camp 
Onlus, with the personal goal of raising 2,000 euro for the non -profit organisation; 1,849 Group employees have renewed 
their commitment to helping CIAI (Centro Italiano Aiut i all’Infanzia – Italian Centre for Childhood Aid), the Community of 
Sant'Egidio and Save the Children, giving their support to the remote adoption of children (876 supports launched), with a 
total contribution of around 200,000 euro; 58 blood donation day s were organised (around 9,500 blood donations a year); in 
the company offices, more than 300 stands were set up to sell solidarity products and collect funds for charitable 
associations and non -profit organisations, with the participation of employees; ov er 700 colleagues signed up to take part in 
"Race for the Cure" (in Rome and Bologna) organised by the Susan Komen Foundation for breast cancer research.  
 
Other initiatives for employees  
[GRI 201 -3] ASSILT (supplementary healthcare association for the em ployees of TIM Group companies), funded by the Group 
companies, by employee members and retired members, is a non -profit -making organisation providing services to its members 
and beneficiaries that are supplementary to those provided by the Italian nationa l health service, including - together with 
public healthcare establishments - collective and individual research, knowledge -gathering initiatives and health prevention 
activities, and the promotion of health education initiatives to protect the health and  physical well -being of its members. In 
2017, the association disbursed refunds totalling approximately 51 million euros (around 550,000 cases). As of December 31, 2017, the Association had 148,000 members, including 48,000 employees, 32,500 pensioners and  67,500 family members.  
[GRI 201 -3] ASSIDA provides senior management staff with refunds for the cost of supplementary health services to those 
provided by the Italian national health service. As of December 31, 2017, the Association had 3,300 members in service or retired, 
in addition to family members, making a total of more than 7,000 assisted members.  
[GRI 201 -3] TELEMACO is the national complementary pension fund for employees in the telecommunications industry, 
established in 1998 as a non -profit association and operative since October 2000; its objective is to ensure that those subscribing 
are able to maintain their standard of living when retiring, thanks to the creation of supplementary social security, over and 
above the public provisions.   TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE 
 
151 
It is intended for workers, office staff and middle managers of companies that apply the national telecommunications cont ract, 
for employees on permanent, apprenticeship or placement contracts and for people who are physically supported by the 
workers subscribing to the Fund.  
At 1 January 2018  there were 37,702 subscribing employees of Group companies, around 59,200 total subscribers, and 191 
associated companies with active members.  
[GRI 401 -2] All Group workers, whether full or part -time, on permanent or fixed -term contracts, enjoy the same benefits, 
whilst, in Italy, the supplementary welfare institute is extended to wor kers on apprenticeship or placement contracts, as well as 
to employees on permanent contracts.  
CRALT is the recreational club for employees of the TIM Group and organises sight -seeing, sports, cultural and recreational 
activities for its members, employees , pensioners and their families. By entering into specific agreements, CRALT also allows 
members and their families to purchase goods and services at particularly good prices, which can also be settled in instalmen ts. 
One of the most significant of these is the agreement and the resulting contribution provided for the purchase of school and 
university books for the children of members, as a valuable contribution to household purchasing power. As of December 31, 2017, there were 42,436 members, including 36,901 employees and 5,535 pensioners. In 2017, CRALT made an average 
contribution of 17% to the cost of activities for the benefit of its members.

  TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
153 The main applications of 2017 are as follows:  
Recruiting and Selection : in 2017, 15 people were hired by the external market including professionals and managers. To 
support the recruiting process, the implementation of a IT system has been planned, which will integrate the online selection  
phase and the potential to support  the entire recruiting and on -boarding process.  
Onboarding programmes : these aim to provide new hires with the tools to optimise their response speed and have been 
applied to new recruits.  
[GRI 404 -3] Performance Management : the process involves the evalu ation of the goals and responsibilities of the entire 
workforce (managers, professionals and employees) and is divided into four phases (assignment of objectives, evaluation, 
feedback, development plans). In the first four months of 2017 the 2016 Performance Management process was concluded 
which involved the entire Domestic Business Unit (around 50,000 people): [GRI 404 -3] 99.7% of people were evaluated by their 
direct superior and 90% stated that they received feedback from their superior. In July, a Perf ormance Management 2017 
process was launched with the assignment of objectives and was completed in September.  
[GRI 404 -2] Individual development plans : these are made up of a set of training initiatives and on field actions set out by the 
manager, support ed by a system of data processing and analysis, the playbook, which in 2017 proposed an individual 
development plan for each employee based on the results of the Performance Management. Over the course of the year, 
approximately 20,000 individual developme nt plans were used on an optional basis, out of a total of approximately 32,000 
assigned plans (63%), including individual managerial plans.  
Over the year, the evolution of the IT platform was planned, based on the new TIM skills model. Furthermore, the process was 
fine-tuned in order to:  
•  link the Development Plans to the various moments of the individual's company life, from evaluations (e.g. Performance Management, Assessment) through to role changes, and other initiatives launched by the relevant manager;  
•  facilitate the use of developme nt plans on an ongoing basis throughout the year.  
[GRI 404 -2] Managerial Development : consists of a series of processes and plans (assessment of potential; appointment to 
executive grade; succession planning; managerial leadership development plans) for identifying and rewarding the existing and 
future managerial assets of the company. In the first half of the year, the instrumentation and reporting of the potential 
assessment processes were fully optimised to further consolidate its effectiveness and gover nance.  
Over the course of the year, the following were carried out:  
•  222 Role driven assessments (for operational or managerial coordination roles);  
•  198 People driven assessments (to feed the high potential pool and guarantee managerial turnover over time) ; 
•  27 Top Executive Assessment.  
 
In relation to managerial positions, the pipeline for the N -1 positions has been updated.  
Moreover, a "protection" project has been launched for the resource pools with critical skills and/or exposure to "market ris k", 
linke d to a renewed turnover. The affected population – comprised in this initial phase of young graduates hired by the 
Company in the last 7 years (316 people) – was clustered into quadrants that indicated a greater or lesser degree of competence 
and strategic/critical knowledge to identify and subsequently apply personalised courses set out by remuneration measures and valuable training initiatives.

TIM PEOPLE  
 
154 [GRI 404 -2] Motivation Review : in 2017, the experimental phase of this new evaluation process was carried out w ith the aim of 
identifying individual motivation. The experimentation phase involved leaders and collaborators of four Group companies (TCC,  
Sparkle, HRS and I NWIT ), in order to test the tool and proceed to the scientific validation in collaboration with U niversità La 
Sapienza. The experimentation involved a total of 1,978 people including 179 managers.  
Brazil  
In 2017 three main programmes were implemented in TIM Brasil which had a great impact on people, in coherence with the 
organizational changes and th e competitive positioning on the market:  
•  [GRI 404 -3] in 2017, an amendment was made to the evaluation scale, which now consists of 7 points, as indicated by TIM 
Italy . This should bring benefits including a standardisation of the curve and a better distribution of results.  
•  Career paths:  the Career Workshop programme continued in 2017, aiming to promote reflection and encourage involvement 
and commitment to career management, raise awareness and promote a proactive attitude to the process, and encourage self-awareness, building a career and an Individual Development Plan. The programme is aimed at leadership and 
professionals.  
•  Development Plan: in 2017, TIM's Individual  Development Plan (PDI) governance process was extended, starting with the 
new Skills Model and stimulating the role of each employee in their personal development and career path.  
 
Training   
[GRI 404 -2] The transformation of the TLC industry towards Digi tal Telco models, the technological evolution of infrastructure 
and market challenges linked to the development of new digital and innovative services are all part of an employment market 
undergoing profound transformation. Digital Transformation  requires us to rethink processes and services and to develop new 
skills and professional roles that are able to make the best use of new business opportunities.  
Given the above, at the TIM Academy, systems and methods of acquiring, disseminating, sharing and managing knowledge were strengthened and developed in 2017 to encourage organizational learning. 
 
Deployment of the Group’s Knowledge Management Model is in i ts third year of application. The activities carried out and their 
close monitoring have allowed us to deploy further activities to optimise and launch new initiatives to support the productio n 
and dissemination of new content, from creating internal and e xternal relationship networks, exchanging knowledge and 
generating ideas, with the aim of encouraging the Group's innovation processes.  
Knowledge Management aims to support all phases in the process of knowledge acquisition, management, access and dissemin ation, while also promoting the Digital Learning process. 
 
In particular, deployment of the Knowledge Management model is concentrated into the following areas of activity:  
1) the creation and development of a Network of Knowledge , that is communities concerned with topics of particular interest to 
the Company in order to develop and encourage inter -departmental integration, the enhancement of the skills and experiences, 
and access to and the dissemination of knowledge through the formalisation of know -how. At present, the Knowledge 
Management team supports around 10 communities operating in the innovation, information technology, sales, technologies 
and network maintenance sectors. These communities have a governance model as well as monitori ng and control tools to 
refine the activities;    TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
155 2) the implementation of initiatives to disseminate and develop Software Culture  in co -partnership with the Technology area's 
Software Factory company departments. The initiatives are announced and dissemina ted on the TIM Academy platform in the 
“Software in TIM” section:  
•  creation and dissemination of self -produced content on both specialist issues concerning emerging Software Skills and 
informative matters to support digital culture and ICT skills at a compa ny level;  
•  creation of a centralized software repository to house and share the source code developed at TIM. The repository is 
accessible to everyone and allows the user to create new projects, define software development teams and collect 
contributions. The repository also allows for the archiving and versioning of source code and management of the complete 
lifecycle of the software, integrating it with tools that implement continuous integration and continuous delivery chains;  
3) the creation of TIM Smar t Corners , namely short info rmal in -person meetings in the C ompany’s offices and virtual ones on 
the TIM Academy platform, in which expert colleagues voluntarily share their professional knowledge about the most innovative  
and business- related areas. The n ew format for Smart Corner Webinars includes the creation of webinars, which can also be 
accessed via the TIM Academy catalogue at a later date. This format supports the in -person mode, enabling greater use and 
adding to a repository that is always availab le for consultation;  
4) the New Capabilities Observatory  to identify emerging trends and new skills with a high business potential, benefiting from 
the contribution of various “observation hubs”, both within the Group and outside, such as partnerships with  universities, 
research organisations and internal innovation centres. In this context, the Pioneers Community, set up in October 2016 and consisting of colleagues identified as knowledge “pioneers” in their field of expertise, has provided important eleme nts for 
scouting new skills and updating the specialised know -how of jobs and professions. Community represents an innovative 
channel to “power” new know -how within the TIM Academy and speeds up the time -to-market of education courses to 
construct new skills/professionalisms. 
 
In relation to the training model and skills development in a broad sense, the main drivers to define the programmes with are  
set out below:  
•  retraining and enhancing professionalism;  
•  developing the digital skills of all company staff ;  
•  evolution of managerial profiles;  
•  individual development plans for the entire company workforce.  
In line with these drivers, TIM Academy, TIM's corporate university, has an innovative approach to learning and the sharing o f 
know -how to support the digit isation process and cultural and business transformation.  
The TIM Academy platform, which is always available with multi -device access, presents learning plans that are customised to 
the person and role, an open training offer with guided self -learning cou rses on specialised skills and professions (learning map).  
The training activities are split into four macro -categories:  
•  management education;  
•  development of role- based and specialized skills, and new capabilities;  
•  development and empowerment;  
•  institutiona l and corporate culture.  
For each of the abovementioned areas the main activities carried out in 2017 are set out below.   TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
156 Management education  
[GRI 404 -2] 2017/2018 process: in 2017, training on the managerial target focused on the cultural change needed to achieve 
the Plan objectives, on customer care and on management of people at times of transformation. The process, developed in 
“blended” mode, involved about 700 managers, proposing targeted and differentiated programmes based on the complexity of 
the roles managed: webinar sessions, online coaching courses, bite -size training and video talks, in- person labs and workshops 
on strategic topics with endorsers of excellence;   
Coaching/Mentor ing: in-person and online coaching courses were launched to support  managerial roles, which include gyms, 
structured feedback and individual interviews with the coach; a mentoring programme was launched in 2017 which involved 
around 100 people who held exchanges in the role of mentor, peer mentor, mentee or reverse mentor ; 
Online library : all managers have access to various online libraries to make full use of videos, webinars and materials from 
national and international speakers on business, finance, technology and leadership topics. In 2017, around 1,600 managers made u se of the training content in the online Libraries.
 
 
Development of role -based and specialized skills, and new capabilities  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach ] [GRI 404]  [GRI 404 -2] Training to develop role- based and specialized skills as well as 
new capabi lities is essential for the implementation of the strategic drivers, and therefore occupies a central role in the Group's 
training investments plan.  
The main projects launched in 2017 are:  
Big Data Transformation:  this is a "Big Data" skills development pa th with the aim of creating all of the new professional roles 
needed to manage the corporate and business transformation;   
Skill improvement for OA in -the-Field Technicians : blended training for around 9,000 in -the-field technicians aimed at 
bridging the g aps in the technical skills that emerged from the skill assessment.  
Field Management Training:  training for managerial roles of Integrated Access Network Assurance & Delivery (Field Force) in 
the Open Access area;  
Line professional retraining : various ret raining courses have been launched for professional roles operating in "adjoining" areas 
of responsibility or within the same business units;  
Development of the entire TIM faculty : the TIM Academy has established the "Line Faculty" with the aim of enhancing the

157 Development and empowerment  
[GRI 404 -2]The organizational changes and the evolution of business -linked skills require new tools to support t he change and 
the awareness of TIM’s people.  
Digital skills development : in order to seize the opportunities offered by the digitisation of work and the company, the TIM 
Academy has developed an e -learning course for the target population, to be opened to all the group’s employees in 2018. The 
course starts with a self -assessment of the employees’ knowledge, before proposing a certified training programme in 
accordance with the European standard DigComp1. An “open badge” is awarded following an end -of-course assessment test;  
“English@TIM” : English language training open to all the Group's employees. A personalised English course can be put 
together thanks to the online language training platform;  
The TIM Skills Model : the aim of this e -training programme, w hich was launched in March for managers and professionals, is to 
help promote the new TIM skills Model and to improve understanding of it to guide behaviour (see the Development and New 
Skills section in this chapter);  
Mindfulness:  an e- training programme  on mindfulness was developed within the longevity project, as a tool supporting 
individual effectiveness and the ability to manage the many stimuli to which we are subjecte d on a daily basis both at the 
Company and in our private lives;  
Individual deve lopment training plans : e-training courses availabl e for all those working at the C ompany, to boost the skills 
highlighted following the performance process;  
Post -onboarding training plan : around 300 colleagues, on 2013 -2016 onboarding plans, were involved in  a professional 
development programme in 2017 aimed at building both soft skills and specialist know -how to support their relevant professions 
or for managerial development.  
 
Institutional and corporate culture  
[GRI 404 -2] This training aims at supporting  the transformation of the organization culture in line with the evolution of the 
social, environmental and economic context and at disseminating knowledge of the content required by the legal formalities.  
In this sense, institutional and mandatory trainin g, involving all employees, aims to foster awareness and spread knowledge of 
the content promoted by the departments  
•  Compliance (aimed at increasing knowledge and respect for the Group's value, improving the skills in processes and 
procedures, as well as in the methodologies and the tools used for Compliance purposes),  
•  Health, Safety & Environment (aimed at ensuring compliance with the reference regulations on Safety in the workplace),  
•  Regulatory and Equivalence (for topics relating to Antitrust and Equivalence).  
 
The main 2017 projects are:

158 New Equivalence model (NEM):  after the operation carried out in 2016 concerning Wholesale managers and operators, a 
programme was launched in 2017 dedicated to staff in the commercial departments (TIM Retail), to facilitate the transition to 
the New Equivalence Model;  
Safety: in relation to the obligations deriving from current legislation, senior managers were involved, and company prevention 
and protection measures deriving from current legislation were implemen ted by providing a number of training programmes, as 
in previous years. The programmes aimed to guarantee the protection of all professionals visiting and working at the Group’s 
workplaces. All employees were involved in the compulsory safety modules;  
Anti -corruption and Whistleblowing : a specific e -learning module addressing everyone in the Group was created to encourage 
the adoption of transparency, correctness and behaviours in good faith. Lastly, awareness -raising sessions were scheduled for 
managers ab out the Competition Authority legislation and the topics of Compliance and Awareness regarding the Market 
Abuse Regulations and the new European Data Protection Regulation ; 
Diversity1: basic training and refresher courses dedicated to the Sales departments  and Call Centre personnel.  
All personnel operating in the Security Department of TIM  are trained and updated on national and European Community 
legislation and regulations governing company safety, and go about their duties in complete compliance with all current 
company procedures and policies in force. More specifically, in order to pro tect the Company's human, tangible and intangible 
resources and infrastructures, Security staff analyse risks and reports of safety incidents, preventing loss and limiting dam ages, 
interfacing with the Civil Protection Department and the other institutiona l entities responsible for managing emergencies or 
major events involving the various company assets. Security personnel do not perform crowd control duties nor escort people o r 
values, which is instead a task institutionally assigned to the police force.  
 
The Job Center  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach] [GRI 404] [GRI 404 -2] The Job Center takes care of the professional retraining process.  
The informative interview which the person has with their manager, a Human Resources representative and a representative from the Job Center is an essential step of the overall process. The aim of the interview is to openly clarify the reasons fo r the 
project, the criteria, objectives and methods of action.
 
The retraining process consists of two programmes:  
•  crossover train ing on digital skills, common to all professional profiles; 
•  specialist training, designed according to the specific requirements of the new professional role.  
The Job Center constantly monitors the end -to-end process and guides people through all stages of  the project until their first 
placement period.  An ad hoc survey is conducted at the end of the first 3 months to evaluate any fine tuning aimed at 
guaranteeing “time to perform”.  
More than 2,864 people have been involved as at 31 December 2017, of whom : 
•  98.3% have already had their informative interview

Brazil   
In Brazil, all new employees attend courses on key issues for TIM, such as ethics, sustainability, environmental policies, safety, 
the skills model, technical training and anti -corruption policies. The latter is already in keeping with the skills disseminated 
throughout the Group. The  start of the development courses includes onboarding, consumer, corporate solutions and caring 
(basic training) themes and incorporates them into activities in the relevant area, as well as a range of courses based on 
individuals’ experience in the sector in which they operate (updating, product and offer launches, recycling and development).  
In 2017 the onboarding concept was extended to all employees who start the development process on their first day at TIM, and 
they are supervised and supported for t he whole of their first year at the Company in the process of integration, orientation, 
training and assessment. The training plans are directly connected to TIM’s strategy. To increase the level of involvement an d 
knowledge of our employees, responsibilit y, new digital skills and customer experience topics were addressed.  The customer 
experience topic was developed through the training of internal multipliers, in which employees act as ambassadors for the topic at TIM.

[GRI 404 -1] The Group invested more than 14 million euros in training courses in 2017, equal to a cost of 236.98  euros per head. 
The value shown only takes into account the amount spent on training courses and does not include the personal benefit 
obtained by course participants and the positive impact on TIM’s performance. The training courses are therefore worth more 
than they cost to deliver.  
 
Collaborations with schools and universities  
In 2017 we consolidated our relationship model with the main stakeholders of the academic world, schools, social and 
institutional organisations, with the aim of guiding young people, helping implement the university “third mission”, enabling  
innovation, enhancing and fully utilising  talent and disseminating digital culture. Our partnerships are planned and 
implemented to encourage cross fertilisation , maintaining the objective of developing how our Employer Branding is perceived, 
by means of the following drivers:  
•  Enhancement of int ernal expertise  with teaching and testimonials on specific themes  
•  Careers advice for students in line with digital skills  
•  Open innovation opportunities  
 
Partnerships were therefore activated or consolidated aimed at generating value in the short/medium -term, making know -how 
available to develop and train the younger generation.  
These partnerships were established through the following main initiatives: collaboration with secondary schools (both techni cal 
institutions and high schools) within  the context of work -related learning, with the aim of building a structured relationship with 
high schools in order to enhance internal expertise, getting in touch with young people across Italy and promoting the 
Company’s image; subscribing to innovative  work -related projects, including with universities; funding of scholarships to  TIM Sustainability Report 2017

cloud computing , geomarketing, big data and e -health to LTE and robotics, including issues related to web law and economics; 
funding of scholarships for deserving Engineering degree students, primarily from Southern Italy, for the 2 two -year 
programmes provided by CONSEL- Consorzio Elis to develop ICT skills; collaboration with postgraduate study courses on themes 
relating to our business; initiatives to disseminate sources of knowledge on the topic of digital transformation with the pur pose 
of transferring knowledge aimed at supporting digital transformation  and evolution; involvement in the drafting of the 
“Osservatorio Università -Imprese” Report for dialogue between Universities and Businesses, organised by the Fondazione CRUI; 
involvement in working groups on the topic of the “School -Work Relationship” org anised by Cotec - Fondazione per 
l’Innovazione Tecnologica; the promotion of our best practices within the context of work -related learning with various 
institutional players, such as the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR), Confindustria, Assokowledge and 
Confindustria Digitale.  
The partnerships activated work in synergy with the Employer Branding initiatives, through involvement in meetings at 
Universities and Schools, with pupils, students, degree students and recent graduates and getting some young colleagues 
involved. Moreover, around 50 training internships have been started and 35 degree theses managed to date.

162 HEALTH  & SAFETY  
[GRI 103 -1: Management Approach]  [GRI 403]  The 2017 materiality analysis confirmed the protection of health and safety 
as a material topic for the entire Group. The Health and Safety at Work Management System imple mented by TIM ensures that 
the C ompany complies in full with national legislation and agreements reached with trade unions; it also establishes  numerous 
initiatives aimed at ensuring increasing safety for workers.   
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 403]    In Italy, the reference legislation is the Consolidated Law on Health and 
Safety at Work, which, amongst other aspects, specifically requir es participation and consultation on the matter with the 
workers' representatives. During 2017, the main areas of action in the field of health and safety at work concerned the updat ing 
of the risk identification and assessment process in line with the rev ised employer model, and the consequent review of the 
organisational and procedural framework linked to the management of prevention aspects.  
Campaigns to monitor physical agents continued, by means of tools to measure, in particular, vibrations, noise and  
electromagnetic fields.  Training activities were delivered for all company employees, in particular for operational technica l staff 
increasingly affected by the application of new technologies and involved in new operating scenarios. As part of the infor mation 
and awareness -raising initiatives to strengthen the safety culture, an informative digital product was produced, dedicated to the 
management of emergencies in the event of earthquakes. With reference to the monitoring of accidents, careful analysis of 
events and potential identification of corrective actions continued. Also, direct involvement of the lines affected and of the HR 
department was reinforced for greater synergy. A number of digital projects are also being developed in collaboration with 
technical personnel; these are also aimed at the application of new technologies in the Safety area.   
The Health and Safety at Work Management System implemented by TIM ensures that the Company complies in full with 
national legislation and agreements reached with trade unions; it also establishes numerous initiatives aimed at ensuring 
increasing safety for workers. The regulation requires the workers' safety representative to be elected or designated by the workers from the trade unions present in the comp any.  
TIM has a procedure in place describing the rules and requirements of each subject in the "genesis" process, the management 
and closure of reports of incidents at work and/or while travelling involving workers for which companies are required to pay  an 
INAIL [Italian national institute for insurance covering accidents at work] premium. The procedure establishes that when an injury occurs, the worker shall send an injury certificate to his manager and to the HR management. The latter shall then sub mit 
a report of the injury to INAIL, which, after suitable checks, shall either confirm or reject the injury. If the injury is no t recognised, 
the days for which the worker is absent will automatically become days of absence for ordinary sickness  
[GRI 403 -1] The number and method of designation or election of workers' safety representatives, together with the salaried 
working hours and the tools used to fulfil duties, are established during collective bargaining. The legislation is applied throughout Italy and , in particular, as concerns TIM S.p.A., Health and Safety Committees have been established. 
[GRI 403 -4] 
According to the agreements stipulated with the trade union organisations, these Committees play a participatory and 
collaborative role aimed at guaran teeing joint analyses and discussion by the company party and the union party of all matters 
relating to health and safety at work, on a national and territorial level.  To this end, the agreement establishing the 
Committees states that both the Joint Nati onal Health and Safety Committee (CPSSN) and each of the four Joint Territorial 
Health and Safety Committees (CPSSTs) shall number three members appointed by the C ompany and three members 
appointed by the trade unions signing the agreement. Apart from the specific duties assigned by the agreement to the 
Committees, the CPSSN has the task of coordinating and instructing the CPSSTs, which, in turn, act as an interface with, and 
support, the workers' representatives.

The positive downward trend in the number of accide nts at work continued in 2017, with a 8.2% fall compared to 2016. The 
accident figures also show an improvement on the values of the previous year. Details on accidents, occupational diseases and  
absences required by standard GRI [GRI 403- 2] are given in t he Appendix to this chapter.  
The main types of injuries recorded were, in decreasing order: falls, sprains/pulled muscles, road accidents, injuries from 
handling materials, blows, crushing and other minor types. As regards occupational diseases, the reports made to INAIL [Italian National Institute for Insurance Against Accidents at Work] during the year of reference and processed for acknowledgement, 
were considered.  
In 2017, the occupational diseases reported by workers concerned pathologies relating to neoplasia, the musculoskeletal system

as a material topic for the entire Grou p. The Health and Safety at Work Management System implemented by TIM ensures that 
the C ompany complies in full with national legislation and agreements reached with trade unions; it also establishes numerous 
initiatives aimed at ensuring increasing safety  for workers.  [GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  TIM has always entertained 
open, transparent relations with the trade unions and workers' representatives, in the belief that it is only through continuous, 
constructive dialogue that the best possible balance  can be struck with respect to the expectations of all stakeholders.  [GRI 
102- 41] All Group workers, both in Italy and in Brazil, are covered by Collective Labour Agreements reached with Trade Union 
Organisations and all personnel are guaranteed the possibility of attending union meetings, in terms of paid leave and compan y 
space to ena ble them to be held, as well as of freely participating in consultation procedures for the election of trade union 
representatives. In no Group operations is the right to union participation at risk or disputed. Amongst other things, union 
agreements lay down the ways in which these rights can be enforced and establish the bodies in charge of controlling 
compliance therewith. [GRI 402 -1] Organi zational changes with significant effect on employment levels and personnel are 
discussed with the trade union repr esentatives and, in some cases, an ad hoc agreement is stipulated, specifying the terms and 
conditions of the reorganisation.  [GRI 408 -1] [GRI 409 -1] Collaboration with the workers' representatives, together with the 
internal control systems and procedures , has meant that no violation or risk has been reported with regards to the application 
of the Group's Social Responsibility policies protecting the essential rights of employment, such as the ban on forced labour  or 
child labour1. 
 
TIM S.p.A.  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 402]  The search for constant dialogue and discussion with the union 
representatives led to major agreements being reached, aimed at reconciling the needs of the business with those of the peopl e 
who work in the Company. This has a llowed agreements to be reached for the implementation of efficiency improvement plans 
that can mediate between the needs of the workers and those of the Company.  For example, a complex negotiation process 
involving the leading trade union organisations wa s completed in late 2015 with the signing of a framework agreement to 
manage staff redundancies.  
Like its predecessors, the agreement provided for the use of a mixture of integrated instruments and measures that are not 
socially traumatic but that are economically sustainable, including the use in 2016 -2017 of Defensive Solidarity Contracts, as 
required by the Jobs Act, combined with the strategic role of the training lever, as a pivotal element to encourage professional 
retraining and requalification in order to counteract redundancies. Defensive Solidarity Contracts are agreements that provid e 
for wo rking hours to be reduced in order to avoid downsizing. For the workers to whom the contract will be applied, provision is 
made for INPS (Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale) to make up part of the remuneration not received due to the reduction in working hours. In 2017 the benefit on the cost of labour obtained from solidarity contracts was 117 million euros for 
the Group (118 million euros in 2016) all afferent to the Parent Company.

Brazilian government   TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
166 The other instruments agreed between the Parties, such as the mobility provisions of Law 223/91 and article 4 of the Fornero 
Law, are in any case of a voluntary nature1. 
The 2018- 2020 Business Plan and the respective HR Management Plan were presented and discussed with the Trade Unions. 
The personnel guidelines will be aimed at adopting measures intended to support the corporate transformation process that awaits the Company in terms of the digitalisation of processes and services.  
[GRI 407 -1b] The Company and the Trade Union Organizations reached an understanding tha t determines the structure of the 
2017/2019 performance bonus for companies of the TIM Group.  
The Bonus takes a new approach: it provides for equal incentive systems for all, from managers to technical personnel, and th ey 
are based on the results achieved with respect to the goals set. The agreement, which positively concludes the negotiations 
initiated with the trade union, provides for the performance bonus to be comprised of:  
•  a “basic” bonus, which uses the group EBITDA as an indicator;  
•  a “production” bo nus, which uses the revenues from group services net of product revenues as an indicator;  
•  an “improvement” bonus which uses the Customer Satisfaction Index as an indicator;  
•  a “department” bonus linked to the departmental targets.  
The objectives, changed by managerial incentive systems, recognise the contribution of all workers to the achievement of the forecast economic and production results.  
The average value of the bonus for TIM was also defined, correlated and commensurate to the achievement of the goa ls set. 
The payout, made annually for the duration of the agreement, will concern all workers, including those with apprenticeship an d 
fixed -term contracts, but the bonus will be awarded upon achievement of, first of all, the measure set for the Group Ebit da 
indicator.  
The parties have also provided for the welfare option, according to which people may choose whether to receive all or a part of the bonus in welfare services, benefiting from full tax relief. The list of services includes, inter alia, daycare  centres, taxes and 
school books, elderly care, healthcare costs, pension funds, loans, shopping vouchers, sports and free time which are only a part 
of the welfare capital, in which TIM invests a total of over 100 million euros each year. A specific joint consultancy body has been 
set up to manage the agreement, which will be notified of the goals each year, derived from the budget process, in accordance  
with the Strategic Plan; this body is tasked, inter alia, with analysing the types of services accessib le through welfare. 
With respect to the trend reversal of the Company's main economic and profit indicators, recorded in the second half of 2016,  in 
2017 TIM paid its employees a contribution made on the basis of overall efficiency recovery and improvement  of the Company’s 
economic performance. In this sense TIM’s people were paid a One- off Bonus, diversified according to their grade. Likewise, the 
disbursement also concerned staff from other companies in the Group.  
 
[GRI 407 -1b] At the end of the discussions on agile working started by TIM with the Trade Union Organizations, an 
understanding was reached, with the aim of partaking in the spread of agile working at the company, already introduced 
experimentally with a first pilot phase in 2016- 2017. The under standing on agile working reached with the Trade Union

by the Parties to achieve the goals of improving productivity, promoting so cial, economic and environmental sustainability and 
encouraging work- life balance, with particular attention to family care needs. To manage the agreement, the Parties have set 
up a system of quarterly checks to be carried out nationwide on the progress of the experiment, the equipment available, the 
organizational areas involved and the monitoring of the “hours of absence reduction” productivity indicator identified by the  
Parties. Local Trade Union Organizations will also be sent a periodic information no tice on the progress of the experiment in the 
area of reference.  
[GRI 103 -3: Management Approach]  [GRI 402]  In September, the new agile working experiment was therefore launched on 
a voluntary basis and will run until 31 December 2018; the TIM people who perform compatible activities will have the 
opportunity to work in agile working mode at another company office and/or non -company establishment indicated by the 
employee, in the manner and time indicated by the company, in compliance with the agreement est ablished. In the context of 
the procedure under law 223/91 launched by TIM in July 2017 with respect to 382 workers, the company and the trade union, during the various joint examination sessions, further explored the reasons indicated by the Company. The discussion, aimed at 
finding the most appropriate method to manage the redundancies, concluded positively with the agreement signed on 8 
November 2017; the Parties agreed on the use of collective dismissal to reduce staff numbers, identifying a maximum of 340 
workers and, in accordance with current legislation, the “non -opposition” criteria to execute the dismissals. The agreement

and UILCom -UIL, as the parties that established the recreational club for employees of the Telecom Italia Group (CRALT), signed 
an agreement that defined the new structure of the Club.The agreement reached supersedes the previous notifications of 
withdrawal from the Club and cancellation of the agreements, positively concluding the phase of discussions between the 
Parties by identifying innovative and economically sustainable solutions for reviewing the structure and management charges of the Club which ensure, in terms of efficiency and sustainability, the operational continuity of CRALT. 
Brazil  
[GRI 103 -2: Management Approach]  [GRI 402]  The Company held two meetings with natio nal federations (Fenattel and 
Fitratelp), which together represent 27 Italian trade unions, to negotiate the 2017 Profit -Sharing Scheme (PPR). Moreover, the 
renewal of the Collective Labour Agreement was also discussed, with negotiations completed with the  federation representing 
19 states, while negotiations are still underway with the other federation, which represents 8 states, due to failure to reac h an 
agreement with employees. Negotiations on the addendum to the collective labour agreement for 2017/20 18 will be resumed in 
the third round of meetings.  
 
Remuneration policy  
[GRI 102 -37] The Group remuneration policy is established in such a way as to guarantee the necessary levels of 
competitiveness of the Company on the employment market. Competitivenes s translates into supporting the strategic 
objectives, pursuing sustainable results in the long -term, ensuring the engagement with people, safeguarding internal fairness 
principles, and seeking to safeguard coherence at Group level, while taking into accou nt the diversity of the reference markets. 
The result is a remuneration structure that seeks to guarantee the correct balance between fixed and variable components, 
both short and long -term, alongside benefit and welfare systems with total rewarding in min d. In 2017, the Company 
turnaround process and the need to guarantee an economically sustainable corporate management brought about the need for a strict, selective remuneration policy.  
  TIM Sustainability Report 2017  
TIM PEOPLE  
 
168 In brief, the remuneration policy structure is essentially based on t he following components:  
•  fixed remuneration;  
•  variable remuneration;  
•  benefit and welfare.  
More specifically, the fixed component reflects the breadth and strategic nature of the position held and is dictated by 
performance in the reference markets.  
The short -term variable remuneration (MBO) on the other hand aims to establish a transparent link between pay and the 
degree of fulfilment of annual targets. To this end, the targets were fixed according to qualitative and quantitative indicat ors 
that repr esent and are consistent with the strategic priorities and business plan, measured according to pre -established and 
objective criteria. In 2017, as in 2016, the management incentives structure was simplified by reducing the number of objecti ves.  
In 2017, the gate – the Group's Ebitda objective - constituted a condition for access to the bonus associated with all incentivised 
objectives, with an amended mechanism for application compared to 2016: the level to be reached to receive the bonus is the 
Target level equal to the budget value. In 2016, the Group’s EBITDA objective was a condition of access to the bonus associated 
with the Company’s objectives and the level to reach was minimal. The objectives are Group, departmental and individual 
objectives, with different weights for each corporate department. The Performance Management objective, which was also 
provided for in 2017 for all MBO beneficiaries (excluding the Executive Directors), with a relative weight set at 30%, is bas ed on 
the overall result of the assessment, which considers both individual targets and leadership model- related behaviours, in equal 
measures.  
A contractual clawback mechanism is in force, which allows retrieval of the variable remuneration paid out to Executive 
Directors and manage rs with strategic responsibilities starting from 2016. As defined in the policy, the clawback clause can be 
triggered in the three years following payment of the sums. The long- term variable component is aimed at promoting 
consistency between the interests  of management and those of shareholders, through sharing of the business risk; the start of a 
new Long- term Plan for the 2017- 2019 three -year period was considered upon termination of the 2014 -2016 Stock Option Plan. 
For reasons of expediency and economic  sustainability, the launch of a new Long- term plan was postponed until 2018.  
In light of the termination of the employment contract of Mr Cattaneo, the 2016 -2019 Special Award, which was introduced 
when he joined the Company, should be considered extinguished.  In keeping with the Special Award regulations, the other 
beneficiaries were chosen by the CEO from the managers who, in his opinion, contributed to the achievement of “over -
performance”; following approval of the financial statements for 2019  they will receive only the sum accrued in 2016 (80% in 
shares and 20% in cash).  
No Long -Term Incentive (LTI) Plan has been pre- established by contract for the new CEO Amos Genish. Mr Genish shall 
therefore take part in the LTI plans under the terms and co nditions to be approved for the Company’s management by the 
Company’s competent bodies.  In particular, a Performance Share Plan was made available for the three -year period 2018 -2020 
- with a three -year vesting period and two- year lock up period. This Plan  is reserved to the Chief Executive Officer and owners of 
managerial positions with a major impact on company results. The Plan is subject to the achievement of the performance condition linked to the increase in both the share value and economic and financial indicators. The LTI Plan is subject to the claw 
back clause. Its approval is expected at the BoD and Shareholders’ Meeting on 24 April 2018.  With a view to establishing a total  TIM Sustainability Report 2017

169 compensation1 system, the conventional monetary tools have been joined by non- monetary ones including benefits, by 
extending some of them to everyone in the Company.  Benefits and welfare generate a separate economic value from the other 
forms of remuneration. These resources, services and performance systems are aimed at improvi ng the welfare of individuals 
and their families from an economic and social perspective.
