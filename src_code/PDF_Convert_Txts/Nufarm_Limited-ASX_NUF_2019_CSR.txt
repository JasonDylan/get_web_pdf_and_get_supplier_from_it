Nufarm Limited  Sustainability Report 2019 A Sustainability Report
2019
Nufarm Limited  | Sustainability Report 2019This report provides information 
about the sustainability practices 
and performance of Nufarm’s businesses including wholly owned subsidiaries for the year ending 31 July 2019 (referred to in this report as 2019). This reporting period aligns with our financial reporting. 
Health and safety data in this  
report includes permanent and 
non-permanent employees across manufacturing sites, offices and regional service centres. Environmental data excludes Nuseed, our sales offices and distribution centres, however these represent a small percentage of  
our environmental footprint. 
In 2019 we commenced construction 
of a new formulation facility in Greenville, Mississippi in North America. We expect to begin including data for this facility in  
our 2020 report, once the plant  
is operational. Nufarm aims to be open and transparent with our stakeholders about our positive and negative environmental, social and economic impacts. In keeping with this objective, our report has been guided by the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Standard, 2018. 
In 2017 we completed a preliminary 
materiality assessment to identify the sustainability topics relevant to Nufarm and our industry. In response to the outcomes of our stakeholder engagement and analysis, we consolidate our material issues under the themes listed in this table of contents. We believe disclosure against these material issues will provide our stakeholders with a deeper understanding of our business, planning and actions. 
This report has been reviewed and 
approved by Nufarm’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Greg Hunt however it has not had external assurance. Further information  
relating to our sustainability approach and performance  
is communicated through our website (www.nufarm.com),  
annual general meeting, annual report and disclosures to the Australian Securities Exchange  
(ASX). Our most recent previous sustainability report was released  
in 2018. This and previous annual reports can be downloaded from www.nufarm.com.

Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 1 1 Managing Director’s 
message 
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 2 Managing Director’s message 
Safety is our number one priority 
and the introduction of a global process safety management program has been a major element of the strategy implementation  
and a driver of improved safety performance. 
In 2019, performance against our 
principal safety metric, Serious Injury Frequency Rate, deteriorated. This followed a long period of sustained improvement, including 
our best-ever  performance in the 
prior year,  and was a stark  
reminder that the road to zero harm 
is not necessarily a straight line.  
We have learned the importance  
of continually reinforcing safety  
as “top of mind”, particularly in  
an environment where there has 
been a long period of improved performance. While we have expanded the focus of our sustainability efforts beyond safety and health over the past years, making sure every one of our colleagues gets home safely  
every day will continue to be  
our number one priority. 
Improving environmental controls and outcomes has been another key area for progress during the period of strategy implementation. We have developed and implemented a global environmental standard that sets expectations around our key environmental risk areas of waste and emissions, soil and groundwater protection, and resource use and conservation.  
A gap analysis against the standard 
has been completed for all manufacturing operations and  
we have improved the principal elements of our environmental management systems. 
Our efforts have reduced the impact 
of our manufacturing facilities on  
the environment with reductions in water consumption, waste water discharge and air emissions since 2016 and we will continue to seek further improvement in these metrics. 
In 2019 we made good progress 
closing gaps against our environmental standards and  
our management systems have been further strengthened with an additional two manufacturing sites obtaining ISO14001 certification.  
This brings the total number of our manufacturing sites with ISO14001 certification to five and this year  
we have committed to achieving certification at all manufacturing sites by 2024. 
Our people and the Nufarm culture 
play a critical role in both delivering on the company’s strategy and meeting community expectations. Over the past four years we have embedded common values and behavioural expectations that unite our global workforce and have helped us create “One Nufarm”.  
We have formalised our position  
on matters such as modern slavery, equal opportunity and collective bargaining in our human rights policy and committed to lifting inclusion and diversity across our workforce. In 2019 we commenced execution of our three-year inclusion and diversity plan and established regional councils to support the achievement of our target of increasing female participation  
in our workforce. Our product stewardship  
standards and processes support customers to meet growing societal concerns around the sustainability of modern agriculture. This will be an increasing focus for our product development and portfolio teams and will influence how we allocate funding to construct our portfolio  
of future products. 
A significant milestone in advancing 
the maturity of our sustainability approach was the preliminary materiality assessment completed  
in 2017. This has helped confirm  
the issues relevant to Nufarm stakeholders and is an important step as we continue to broaden  
the focus of our sustainability efforts. In 2020 we will re-engage with external stakeholders to expand our materiality assessment to  
inform the next phase of our sustainability strategy. 
There is more work to do. As we 
develop the strategy for the next phase of our sustainability journey, we will build on the strong base  
we have formed to further improve the impact of our operations  
and seek new ways to support growers in achieving their own sustainability goals. 
Greg Hunt  
Managing Director and  
Chief Executive Officer When we launched our sustainability strategy in 2015 our aspiration was  
to achieve a step change in sustainability maturity and impact. As I reflect  
on our achievements and the improved disciplines, processes and structures we have put in place, I believe we have made the business stronger, more sustainable and more accountable to stakeholders for our performance.

Sustainability at Nufarm
Nufarm plays an important role 
supporting food security and nutrition for a growing population by helping farmers improve crop efficiency. We recognise the challenges they face in using limited natural resources in a sustainable way while responding to climate volatility and growing pressures  
on biodiversity. 
We are committed to  
understanding these challenges 
and advancing change within our own organisation and throughout the value chain. We work in partnership with our customers, colleagues, suppliers, regulators, industry groups, and investors to assess, prioritise and manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities. We have adopted  
a risk-based approach to identifying potential social or environmental impacts of our operations or products.
Our approach focuses on the key 
areas where we have the most potential impact or the ability to influence positive change:
• Safety;
• Environment;
• People;
• Product stewardship and  
ethical sourcing; and 
• Governance and ethical conduct. 
These areas guided our  
materiality study which forms  
the basis of this report.Nufarm values  
and behaviours
To support our RARE values,  
Nufarm has a board approved code of conduct which guides employees’ decision making and behaviour. New employees are inducted into our code of conduct when they join the organisation.  
Our code of conduct has executive ownership through the Nufarm leadership team and can be found in the Governance section of our corporate website. 
To support of our values and code 
of conduct, we have nine employee behaviours to guide our people in all their activities (see below).
It is Nufarm’s objective to carry out 
our business with no adverse effect on our people, the community and the environment and to strive for sustainable development

Our distribution of manufacturing 
facilities enables us to tailor our products to suit local conditions and respond rapidly to customer needs. In 2019 we constructed a new formulation facility in Greenville Mississippi in North America to allow us to more efficiently supply our product in this market. This was opened early in our financial  
year 2020.
We primarily sell our crop 
protection and seed products  
direct to channel partners, who  
are distributors that sell directly to farmers and offer other agricultural inputs and advice.
Supplier location is just one of many 
considerations we evaluate when sourcing raw materials and packaging. We have significant suppliers located through Europe, Asia, North America, Brazil and Australia, and more than 3,000 suppliers around the world support our global network. Our global procurement organisation operates out of three key hub locations in Australia, China and Switzerland.

Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 9 Safety
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 10 Safety
Our approach to safety
The most significant safety  
hazards we manage relate to the 
processing of various chemicals  
at our manufacturing sites. 
Risk controls to enable safe 
processing of chemicals are well established across the global chemicals manufacturing industry. Depending on the type of hazard under consideration, we apply industry best practice quantitative and qualitative risk assessment methodologies to understand  
the level of risk, the appropriate hierarchy of control and the layers of control to be applied.
These range from the relatively 
simple 5-Whys type approaches used for non-routine and routine tasks through to sophisticated hazard and operability studies (HAZOP) and layers of protection analysis (LOPA). For these types  
of assessment, we use specialist facilitators and a cross-sectional team to analyse complex, low frequency, high consequence scenarios that have potential to occur at major hazard facilities.
Our safety methodologies and  
their application are described in 
our corporate HSE standard and  
in its cascading detailed corporate procedures. Nufarm engineers, safety and other professionals are trained and experienced in their application. If the need is identified for further specialist expertise, we engage relevant external resources to support the activity. The less 
complex hazard assessments 
carried out at a site’s operations level are supported and facilitated by trained health and safety professionals working with staff who supervise and operate the plant and equipment.
Hazard identification and risk 
assessment processes are subject  
to site level, corporate level and regulator audits to ensure the quality and effectiveness of these activities. Output from these audits are used as an additional input  
into improvements in our safety management system (SMS).
We manage risks using a hierarchy 
of controls, with the first consideration being to remove the hazard entirely and, if this is not feasible, to manage the risks using engineering controls. The next option in order of priority and effectiveness is reducing the risks through administrative controls. Personal protective equipment is used to protect people as a last  
line of defence. Depending on the hazard type and the assessed risk level, multiple layers of risk controls are established such that if any single control fails, it will not result  
in a negative event occurring.
Our HSE standard requires that  
all employees and non-Nufarm 
persons remove themselves from any situation where they believe illness or injury could result and to bring these unsafe conditions to  
the attention of management.  
They do this without fear of adverse consequence, and reporting safety risks is part of our culture.
Safety management 
systems (SMS)
Our SMS has been in place across our 
global operations for many years. 
It comprises of our corporate  
health, safety and environment (HSE) 
policy, HSE standard, HSE procedures  
and site specific HSE procedures. These apply to all Nufarm employees and non-Nufarm persons.
The SMS is managed from a 
corporate level down through  
to a regional and site level and is supported at each of these levels by qualified and industry experienced health and safety professionals and line managers. 
Where the need arises for very 
specialist advice, we engage 
appropriately qualified and 
experienced external consultants  
to advise on the issues at hand.
Our SMS meets industry standards 
for the plastics and chemicals industry as described by relevant global and regional bodies such  
as Chemistry Australia. It also aligns well with other established standards such as ISO 18001 Health and Safety Management Standard.
Our SMS is subject to continuous 
improvement arising from both 
internal and external review and developments. 
We are a member of Responsible 
Care (an initiative of the international chemical industry to improve HSE performance) and through our membership we gain insight to 
advances in best practice that we 
can adopt across our own operations. Our priority is to ensure that all our people go home safely every day.  
We continue to work towards our goal of zero-harm by embedding the processes that identify risks, implement risk reduction measures and foster a culture where people’s health and safety is front of mind in all we do.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 11 Safety (continued)
Process safety 
management
In 2017 we launched our process 
safety management (PSM) program. The program was designed to take a systematic and best practice approach to identify and control hazards at manufacturing sites where a loss of containment could result in a catastrophic incident involving fatalities inside and/or outside the site boundary and/or significant environmental damage or negative community impact.
At the core of this program is our 
PSM standard. This addresses critical risk control factors such as facility design and construction, hazard identification, assessment and control, operations process safety, hazardous materials management, asset integrity and reliability, management of change, competence and training and emergency planning and response. 
Compliance with PSM requirements 
is audited by our corporate teams and by regulators in the relevant jurisdiction. Compliance with PSM requirements is also subject to  
the major hazard facility (MHF) licensing regulations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our Pipe Road and Raymond Road sites in Australia are classified as MHF sites while our sites in Linz, Austria, Gaillon, France and Wyke, UK, all fall under Europe’s Seveso III directive. Incident Management
Hazards and incidents are recorded in our incident reporting and investigation system which  
is available to all staff. 
Investigations are participatory, 
and the methodologies used depend on the severity of the hazard or event or its potential. 
Each operating site runs incident 
management training programs and has trained HSE professionals and engineers to facilitate more complex investigations using methodologies such as root  
cause analysis (RCA). 
The high hazard to injury  
reporting ratio across Nufarm  
sites demonstrates that people  
feel safe in reporting hazards and 
near misses without the concern  
of adverse consequences. 
Serious incidents are notified to  
the Nufarm Chief Executive Officer 
within 24 hours of occurrence.
Health and safety 
audits
Since the inception of our 
sustainability strategy four years ago, we have changed our approach to auditing, focusing on, and going more deeply into, fewer but higher risk incident hazards. 
Our manufacturing sites are the 
current focus of our audit program as this is where the most serious hazards are located. 
Our SMS system is documented and 
self-audited by sites at a set frequency. 
In addition, we undertake corporate audits every two years or more frequently if significant deficiencies are identified.Good practices identified during these audits are transferred to other sites facing similar challenges. Reports and improvement actions arising from the audits are discussed by the group executive and board HSE committee.
Our sites are also regularly audited 
by government authorities to confirm 
compliance and we use external 
auditing organisations on an 
ad-hoc basis to test particular sites  
if a need is identified.
Office environments, while subject 
to the relevant requirements of the 
Nufarm SMS, are not formally 
audited but will be included in  
future program scheduling.
Non-manufacturing 
safety
The most significant non-
manufacturing hazard within our global business involves our staff driving on public roads, often in rural environments, as a part of their job. 
We have active and passive  
safety features for all company 
business vehicles. 
Our corporate driver safety 
procedure incorporates requirements 
for fatigue management, restricts 
mobile phone usage and ensures 
fitness to drive. 
We require all frequent drivers  
to undertake hands on defensive 
driver training, supplementing  
this with online training via the AlertDriving program. This program is a personalised, interactive, 
behaviour-based defensive driving training program. We have also made this program available to  
our broader employee base to  
help make them safer on the road.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 12 Safety training
All employees and non-Nufarm 
persons undergo occupational health and safety induction  
training when joining the company.  Further training is provided depending on a person’s role in  
the organisation and the hazards they may encounter while performing their job.
Workers on a chemical 
manufacturing site can receive training in areas such as chemical safe handling procedures, confined space entry, chemical and electrical isolation procedures,  
fire safety, permit to work and dangerous goods.
We use training needs assessments 
and competency-based training approaches where appropriate. Delivery of training is normally a combination of classroom style training along with on the job, supervised training using qualified personnel. Individual training records are maintained, and our training systems ensure follow-up refresher training is scheduled  
as required. 
Health and safety 
committees
We believe employee participation 
is central to the development and ongoing improvement of systems  
of work and procedures for safe operation of plant and equipment. 
There are active HSE committees 
across our business starting at the top with the board HSE committee. 
Site based health and safety 
committees provide an important 
communication and planning channel where employees and management work together to identify improvements in employee engagement, safety culture and the SMS, and also review and deploy lessons arising from incidents.In many regions it is a regulatory requirement to involve employee elected representatives with prescribed roles and powers and we comply with these requirements.
Protecting the safety  
of our communities 
Regulators play an important  
role in developing and enforcing industry standards to protect our communities and help maintain public confidence. 
Strict regulatory oversight, 
combined with our own process safety management systems,  
ensure we manage the risk from  
our operations to surrounding neighbourhoods to a community acceptable level. 
As an operator of major hazard 
facilities, safety authorities and regulators often require periodic confirmation and verification that we have adequate, effective and sustained hazard controls in place. We are committed to full compliance with regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We also belong to relevant industry groups and contribute to the development of industry standards through these forums. 
Occupational health 
and wellbeing 
Some of our employees work with 
hazardous chemicals as a part of  our manufacturing operations. 
We take the same risk-based 
approach to occupational health management as we do to safety, systematically assessing risk  
and implementing the hierarchy  
of controls.
We provide occupational health 
services to employees across all  
of our operations globally. The type and arrangements vary between sites depending on the size of the manufacturing site, the nature of the hazards at that site and the availability of local medical services. Some sites have an onsite medical centre staffed by a company doctor, company occupational health nurses and ancillary health professionals; some sites have occupational health nurses, while others contract with a local provider to deliver those services.
We have medical surveillance 
programs specific to the type of manufacturing process, materials and potential exposures at our sites along with the requirements of the relevant health authorities. 
We maintain confidential employee 
medical records, in accordance with the medical profession’s standards and practices.
Employee wellbeing
Employee wellbeing contributes to 
productivity and the achievement  
of our business objectives. 
We provide a range of health  
and lifestyle promotion programs  
to support the wellbeing of our 
employees. 
The programs are developed 
locally, with input from employees 
to identify and target specific needs 
of each workforce. 
An on-line library of materials 
supporting wellbeing topics is available to all employees on  
the company intranet.
Customer safety

Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 13 Safety (continued)
2019 performance 
Despite some regions and operating 
sites achieving significant injury prevention milestones in 2019, overall company performance against our principal safety metric, Serious Injury Frequency Rate, deteriorated  
from our best ever performance recorded in the prior year. 
The nature of the injuries incurred 
was predominantly manual handling related injuries with  
some contact and burn injuries. 
The severity of injuries, as measured 
by the length of time a person is absent from work, increased,  
with one incident during the year causing permanent disability  
to one of our colleagues. We acted quickly to identify  
and address the causes for the deterioration in performance and satisfy ourselves there had not been a systemic weakening of controls.  
Our efforts to refresh the focus on safety across our global workforce through stop work initiatives and safety leadership programs improved performance toward  
the end of the year. 
One non-compliance with 
regulatory health and safety requirements relating to incorrect documentation was recorded during the year. This has been addressed to the satisfaction  
of regulators. We made good progress in closing out action items identified during the PSM gap audit in 2017 with 83% of actions now completed (2018: 52%). The program remains on track for completion in 2020. 
We continued to deliver practical 
defensive driver training in all our regions. The “AlertDriving” program was rolled out to more than  
600 employees who drive a high number of kilometres each week  
as a part of their role.
This year we provided over  
17 ,500 hours of safety training to  
our employees and non-Nufarm 
persons.

Our approach 
Our people are integral to how we 
create value for our customers and stakeholders. Their commitment and capability are a key component  
of our success.
Our workforce
We aim to provide an agile 
workforce that responds to the 
seasonal needs of our customers. 
Most of our workforce is full time 
and where the nature of the role allows it, we support flexible  
work arrangements. 
We employ casual, contract labour 
for short periods of time to support manufacturing activities such as labelling and packing during periods of high seasonal demand. 
We also engage the professional 
services of contractors who have unique knowledge or skills to support specific project activities. These include, but are not limited  
to, engineers and information technology experts. 
Human rights
Our human rights policy sets out  
our position on matters such as collective bargaining, modern slavery, inclusion and diversity  
and equal opportunity. 
The policy recognises and respects 
employees’ rights and freedoms to join or not to join organisations of their choosing, to associate freely and bargain collectively.Employment and business decisions based on attributes unrelated to job performance, such as race, gender or sexuality, are not tolerated. 
We have a zero-tolerance stance to 
all forms of modern slavery, both in our operations and our supplier base. 
As a policy, we do not employ 
young workers (persons under  
18 years of age) in hazardous areas of our operations. Due to this and the complex nature of our business, our operations are not considered to be at significant risk of forced or compulsory labour or child labour.
We have processes and controls  
in place to prevent any form of 
modern slavery entering our business through our own recruitment practices or the use  
of third-party labour providers. 
Inclusion and diversity
We believe we are stronger  
when our plans and operations reflect the thinking of all our  
people, representing a broad range of backgrounds, cultures  
and experience. 
Our approach to inclusion and 
diversity is set out in our inclusion and diversity policy, and our strategies and programs are overseen by an executive steering committee and implemented by inclusion and diversity councils  
in each region.Our program for the development 
of current and future leaders, 
NuLead, includes training to  
help our people use evidence  
to reduce the bias in people  
related decision making. 
Our global footprint supports a 
culturally diverse workforce of leaders and teams, representing local cultures and customers in  
over 100 countries. 
The board of directors considers 
gender diversity as a relevant consideration in its succession planning and we are working towards a target of not less than  
30 percent of either gender  
making up our workforce. 
We recruit across the career 
lifespan. This is important to achieving our ambition of increasing the number of senior roles filled from internal appointments. As we make progress against this goal we expect to increase the number of employees in younger age groups to replenish our pipeline of talent.
Disability and inclusion programs 
offered in North America provide opportunities for individuals with developmental disabilities and/or those living with mental illness to work part time in areas that fit their skills.
The Australian Workplace  
Gender Equality Act (WGEA) deems 
Nufarm as a designated relevant employer. We comply with the WGEA requirements. Our people and culture play an important role in delivering on our strategy and meeting community expectations. We aim to provide an 
inclusive and diverse work environment where individuals are valued for their diversity and empowered to reach their full potential. 
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 17 People (continued)
Performance and career 
development
Our performance and career 
development program is called Grow Plan Succeed. 
This is a company-wide program 
that aligns employee priorities  
and career development goals  
with business objectives. 
All employees are expected  
to participate in this program,  
which includes regular check-in 
conversations with managers  
and matrix managers to discuss progress against agreed goals. 
Our training programs are primarily 
aimed at providing employees  
with training that is relevant to their current role and responsibilities. These programs are broadly  
based across roles and regions. They span from training our  
sales people to employee apprenticeship programs at  
our manufacturing sites. 
We also provide leadership 
development programs to build  
the skills that will develop our  
next generation of leaders. 
We provide support for employees 
leaving the company due to termination of employment on  
a region by region basis.  
This could take the form of career transition support, language programs or other employee specific tuition programs.Employee remuneration 
and benefits
We use a global remuneration 
framework to govern remuneration decisions and practices. 
The framework adopts a principal 
of equal pay for equal work and determines remuneration levels based on factors including job description, local market remuneration rates, the skills  
and experience of the employee and criticality of the role. 
We engage external services  
from remuneration specialists or 
market data providers on a case  
by case basis.
Benefits provided to employees 
vary between regions and local employment conditions, however we contribute to retirement plans  
for all employees, meeting local regulatory requirements as  
a minimum.
Remuneration and remuneration 
policies for our board of directors and senior executives are disclosed on pages 29 to 52 of our 2019 annual report.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 18 2019 performance 
Inclusion and diversity
In 2019 we commenced delivery  
of our global inclusion and diversity 
strategy. The strategy aims to embed inclusion and diversity in  
the way we conduct our business wherever we operate around the world. Key activities included: 
• conducting six inclusion and diversity executive steering committee meetings;
• establishing a process and undertaking a global pay  
parity review;
• creating a checklist to assess our ‘people policies’ for bias, and commencing policy reviews around the world;
• continuing unconscious bias awareness training;
• raising awareness of inclusion and diversity through regular communications, assisting to improve employee consciousness of the benefits of a more inclusive work environment;
• continuing the introduction  
of our contemporary talent  
and succession planning methodology that reduces manager bias in the assessment and selection cycle, with a broader range of leaders now utilizing the methodology; and
• continuing to establish recruitment metrics that assist  
us to drive increased female 
representation at Nufarm. Other key initiatives supporting 
inclusion and diversity included:
• continuing to introduce inclusive leadership training for all people managers as they are promoted or join Nufarm; and
• introducing our One Nufarm Behaviours recognition program where 565 people were recognised with 1,518 badges  
of appreciation. 
Performance and career 
development 
This is our second full year with  
the Grow Plan Succeed career 
development program. Performance objectives are now  
in place for 72 percent of women and 74 percent of men.
During the year we implemented  
a training system that will provide 
greater visibility of global employee training and education metrics.  
This will replace data on employee training that is currently compiled  
by each site or department. 
Remuneration and benefits 
We conducted gender parity reviews across all regions.  
Gender pay was analysed  
for employees performing the  
same type and level of job in the organisation. The methodology follows the principle of equal  
pay for equal work. Results of  
the gender pay parity review demonstrated that each region is remunerating employees at parity.
The remuneration structure for our 
senior executives was reviewed during the year to ensure it continues to align with the company’s objectives and some changes were recommended for the 2020 year. Further information on these changes is provided  
on pages 29 to 52 of our 2019 annual report.Objectives  
for 2020
In the second year of implementation for our inclusion and diversity strategy, our focus will be: 
• reinforcing understanding of inclusion and diversity and extending capability training to  
a wider audience; 
• supporting policy compliance to eliminate potential bias; and 
• developing greater gender equality within our internal talent pipeline.
Further information  
on our inclusion and  
diversity goals can  
be found in the 2019  
Nufarm Corporate Governance Statement in the corporate governance section of our website.

Gender diversity
Female representation was steady  
on the prior year at 24 percent,  
with 31 percent of new or vacant 
positions filled by female candidates (2018: 30 percent). Forty-six percent of external appointments to the senior management level were female, reflecting the benefits of our  
policy of having one female  
on the panel for all executive  
and senior management external appointments as well as one female on the shortlist for this group. 
In contrast 14 percent of internal 
promotions to senior management level were female. Twenty-three percent of all internal promotions across the organisation were filled by females compared to 26 percent last year. Lateral moves showed a higher female representation of  
34 percent (2018: 20 percent) and 23 percent of all global mobility was represented by females.  
There were no reported incidents  
of discrimination.

Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 26 Environment
Our approach 
Environmental 
management framework
The key potential environmental 
impacts of our manufacturing operations relate to soil and groundwater contamination,  
waste, effluent and emissions. 
We manage our impacts through  
an environmental management 
framework comprised of corporate policies, standards and procedures. 
We apply the same risk 
management principles to environmental risks as we do to safety. We systematically evaluate the environmental significance in our aspects and impacts and put 
control measures in place to reduce 
environmental risk to as low as reasonably practicable.
We are committed to being fully 
compliant with environmental regulations in the jurisdictions  
in which we operate. 
Our manufacturing sites have 
environmental management systems that meet local regulatory requirements and align with the higher, internal standards that  
we have set for ourselves. 
We provide environmental training 
to our employees and contractors as a part of their induction program. 
We have an internal corporate 
audit framework in place to ensure ongoing compliance with our environmental standards and we undertake ongoing monitoring activities to ensure compliance  
with regulatory requirements.Energy and greenhouse 
gas emissions 
We undertake two primary types  
of manufacturing at our operations: 
synthesis and formulation. Synthesis involves chemical reactions, formulation does not. Synthesis activities are more resource intensive, consuming approximately 80 percent of our total energy use. 
Our manufacturing operations 
generate scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions through combustion activities and purchased steam and electricity. 
The primary energy consuming 
activities at our manufacturing  
sites are: 
• boilers, which generate steam  
to heat materials or provide space heating; 
• electricity for producing  
chlorine and powering  
process equipment; and
• fuel for manufacturing and distribution vehicles. 
We seek to continuously improve our energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through activities like improvements to steam systems or upgrading the energy efficiency of equipment or lighting. 
Our site at Wyke in the United 
Kingdom operates a combined heat and power plant which  
is a highly efficient means of generating steam and electricity. Other air emissions
Our manufacturing sites generate non-greenhouse gas air emissions. We have combustion emissions  
as well as volatile organic compounds (VOC) and particulate matter (PM) generated by our formulation processes.
We eliminate process emissions 
using scrubbers and activated carbon filters and we monitor  
the emissions to ensure ongoing compliance.
We use refrigerants in process 
equipment and air conditioning. Our manufacturing sites are progressively replacing any residual ozone depleting substances and have preventative maintenance plans in place to prevent leakage. We use energy, water and other chemicals to produce our products.  
This generates greenhouse gas and other air emissions as well as  
effluent and waste. We work to reduce our resource consumption and eliminate the potential environmental risks from our emissions through robust environmental management systems and a risk-based approach.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 27 Environment (continued)
Water and effluent
Water is an essential component  
of our products, both in the 
manufacturing process and  
when growers mix the product  
with water to spray their crops. 
We support growers to optimise 
water usage by developing multi-action products and products that support more complex tank mixes. This allows growers to achieve their desired outcomes with reduced water and energy use.
Our manufacturing sites use  
water for production, cleaning  
and cooling. High quality fresh 
water is important for maintaining the quality of our products and all sites use third-party supplied water. 
Each of our manufacturing sites  
has been tasked with establishing  
a water stewardship program.  
The program involves a 
comprehensive water balance, identification of water related impacts in the catchment area  and Nufarm’s influence on these,  
an assessment of risk, and control measures to manage these risks. 
Single-use cooling water is  
our largest water use. For our 
manufacturing facilities at Gaillon  
in France, this is taken from local groundwater and at our site in  
Linz, Austria, it is taken from the Danube. Uncontaminated cooling water is safely released back  
into the Seine in France and  
Danube in Austria in line with  
local environmental licences. 
Monitoring and impact assessments 
have determined this has negligible environmental impact on the rivers. 
Where we can, we reuse water 
internally, however there are strict 
quality and regulatory controls  
on our products that require us to 
thoroughly clean our production 
equipment between production 
campaigns. This can limit the 
suitability of wash water for 
recycling and reuse application. We treat our waste water on site, 
dispose of it to domestic sewers and/or use third party waste water treatment facilities. All sites have controls in place to protect surface water bodies and at some locations we also treat rainwater that falls onto our sites to ensure that even very low levels of chemical are not released directly into waterways. 
There are local regulatory limits  
in place at all locations where  
we discharge water and effluent 
and we monitor these to ensure compliance. Our largest facilities have online monitoring which immediately stops effluent from discharging if limits are approached.
The largest chemical component  
of our effluent is salt, which is a 
waste product of our phenoxy synthesis operations. 
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 28 Waste
Responsible management and 
reduction of waste is a growing challenge faced by companies and communities alike, and Nufarm is no exception. Our manufacturing sites generate both hazardous and non-hazardous waste originating from spent raw material packaging, cleaning operations and past 
use-by-date or obsolete product 
returned from customers. Where possible, we rework the wash waters and out-of specification material to minimise generating additional waste.
We take responsibility for the waste 
packaging generated by customers using our products through container collection and recycling initiatives outlined in the product stewardship section of this report. Soil and groundwater 
We provide primary and secondary containment for our chemicals at our manufacturing facilities to minimise the risk of a loss of containment to the environment. We have a process safety management (PSM) program in place to prevent a loss of containment through application  
of rigorous layers of protection. 
Some of our manufacturing sites  
are located on land that has a  
long history of chemical use prior  
to Nufarm ownership. As a result, 
these sites have a legacy of soil  
and groundwater contamination. When acquiring these sites, we undertook remediation works to make the sites safe to operate and prevent any offsite environmental impact. 
We have ongoing groundwater 
monitoring programs in place to support management of this legacy and we are currently undertaking an assessment at our North Laverton site in Australia. Further remediation maybe required at some of our manufacturing sites in the future which would be done under direction of the local regulatory authority. Biodiversity
Many of our sites are located in industrial zones with no direct or indirect impact on significant or protected areas. However, there are two protected areas on our site in Gaillon and another seven within 800m of the site. These areas are classified under Zone naturelle d’intérêt écologique, faunistique  
et floristique (ZNIEFF) and Natura 2000 as having high biological or ecological value. Our operations have had no impact on these areas, and we have not needed to protect or restore any habitats this year.

While most of our sites are in industrial areas, some operate close to residential neighbourhoods and from time to time we receive complaints from our neighbours.  
We have complaint management processes in place at these sites to quickly investigate and respond  
to concerns raised by neighbours.

Our performance
Environmental 
management framework
Two years ago, we commenced  
an environmental improvement 
program at our manufacturing  
sites to strengthen and further improve our environmental management systems. 
This began with each site 
undertaking an environmental gap analysis against the corporate requirements and implementing gap closure plans. These plans focus on the key potential environmental impacts of our manufacturing sites such as soil  
and groundwater, waste, effluent and emissions. 
We made significant progress with 
environmental gap closure during 2019 with 65 percent of action items now complete, up from 14 percent last year. Our objective is to have 90 percent of activities complete by the end  
of next year. Due to the long-term nature of some environmental activities the plans will not be fully implemented for several years. 
We further strengthened our 
environmental management  
system during the year with  
our sites in Linz, Austria, and  
Port Klang in Malaysia achieving ISO14001:2015 certification. 
This brings the total number of  
sites with certification to five (other 
certified sites are Wyke, UK, Gaillon, France and Merak, Indonesia) and we have committed to certifying  
all twelve of our manufacturing  
sites to ISO14001:2015 by 2023. 
Environmental training was an area 
for improvement identified through the gap analysis conducted two years ago. This year we provided 1,500 hours of environmental training and this will be an area of focus for a number of sites in 2020. Energy and Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions 
Total energy consumption reduced 
in 2019 while greenhouse gas emissions increased due to increased fuel consumption. 
Performance against energy 
intensity and greenhouse gas intensity measures deteriorated due an increase in the mix of synthesised products manufactured relative to formulated products (synthesis of products requires more energy  
and generates more greenhouse gas than formulation). 
The change in mix was a result of a 
reduction in formulation of products in Australia where manufacturing was temporarily halted for several months due to ongoing drought conditions which reduced demand. Synthesis activities continued in Australia as these products also service an export market and were not as impacted by the drought.

6. G reenhouse gas intensity includes only the scope 1 and 2 emissions reported under Greenhouse gas emissions.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 30 Other air emissions A major driver of the improvement  
in other air emissions has been the 
installation of an incinerator to eliminate our primary hazardous  
air pollutants (HAP) at our site in Linz. We have now had a full year operating this unit and seen  
a greater than 95% reduction  
in these emissions.

Water and effluent
We reduced our water withdrawal and consumption again this  
year. This was achieved through improvements to groundwater extraction and cooling systems  
at our site in Gaillon, France.  
The resulting 315 ML reduction in water withdrawal over the last  
two years represents eight percent of the Nufarm Group’s total water use and has led to a corresponding drop in water discharge. As with energy, our synthesis activities require more water  
than formulation activities and generate more effluent. 
Water and discharge intensity 
increased during 2019 as a result  
of an increase in the mix of synthesised products manufactured relative to formulated products. 
Our plant in Merak, Indonesia 
installed a waste water treatment plant this year, improving the quality of waste water discharged from the site and we are currently installing  
a treatment plant at our operation  
in Maracanau, Brazil. 
We are continuing to research  
new advanced technologies to 
improve the quality of the effluent we discharge to domestic sewers  
to benefit downstream water users.
We had no significant impact on 
natural water bodies from either effluent discharges or run-off from our sites this year.

Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 32 Waste
Changing regulations in the United 
States several years ago resulted in us needing to dispose of all vessel wash water as hazardous waste. As our business grew in the US this led to a year on year increase in hazardous waste. The site applied for and now has just received regulatory approval to reuse  
some of these wash waters on site again. The project to implement appropriate controls for the management of these washings  
is underway and we expect to  
see the amount of hazardous  
wash water generated from this region start to decline as we  
begin to progressively implement  
the improvements.

One of these was an odour complaint from at our site in Wyke, UK and the other a noise complaint at out site in Gaillon, France. 
The improvements we’ve made  
to odour emissions control at Maracanau, Brazil have been  
very successful at improving the  
air quality for the local community 
and we have not received any complaints this year.

Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 34 Priorities  
for 2020
Our focus for 2020 is to 
embed our corporate environmental audit process and undertake the actions that arise  
from it and to drive environmental 
improvements activities 
progressing our environmental gap closure plans to 90 percent completion. Figure 4 – Environmental monitoring

and Monitoring
From time to time incidents may 
arise that result in the regulators issuing remedial notices as a part of their regulatory oversight. We work with these regulators to ensure full compliance with their requirements while also addressing the underlying cause of the incidents. While we 
have a goal of zero non-compliance with regulatory requirements,  
this year we had ten incidents. 
Seven of these related to minor  
but reportable exceedances  
on effluent and air emission 
parameters. The balance was  
for remedial notices issued in a  
prior year that are being actively addressed, one of which was closed early in our 2020 financial year. We have not received  any monetary fines or sanctions related to these items.
We continued to comply with 
release parameters for other, routine monitoring activities, exceeding 99.5 percent compliance. This year we  
have increased our monitoring, undertaking several soil and groundwater studies.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 35 Ethical sourcing
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 36 Ethical sourcing
Our approach  
to sourcing 
Our global supplier code of 
conduct sets expectations of  
our suppliers including business conduct, environmental performance, human rights,  
child and forced labour and employee health and safety.
The code guides our supplier 
selection and the ongoing evaluation of supplier relationships.
Our human rights policy establishes 
a zero-tolerance stance on all forms of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain.
In line with the requirements  
of the UK Modern Slavery Act,  
our Modern Slavery Statement 
describes the actions we have taken 
to identify and prevent modern slavery in our supply chain.
We partner with EcoVadis to  
conduct corporate social responsibility (CSR) assessments  
of our suppliers. This process increases our supply chain transparency and is an important step towards improving the sustainability of our supply chain.
Our Modern Slavery Statement can 
be found on the homepage of our website and copies of our supplier code of conduct and human rights policy can be found in the corporate governance section of our website. Supplier Impacts
Our most significant suppliers manufacture the chemicals and packaging we use to manufacture our products. We source from more than 3,000 suppliers located in  
over 20 countries. 
Like us, they have the potential  
for environmental impact through 
air emissions, hazardous waste, effluent, resource consumption  
and greenhouse gas emissions. 
The hazardous chemicals used  
by our suppliers also present a 
higher occupational health and safety risk to their workers, however, these industries typically provide extensive safety training and this requires workers with above average skill and education levels. 
While the risk of modern slavery 
exists in all supply chains, our main 
suppliers are not considered as 
vulnerable to modern slavery 
practices as are industries that rely 
on workers to carry out manual  
or menial tasks. Assessing supplier 
performance
We established a supplier CSR 
assessment process three years ago. We engaged EcoVadis,  
a global leader in this field, to undertake the program with us. 
The assessments evaluate suppliers’ 
environmental, social, ethical and sustainable procurement policies, actions and results.
We work to build long term 
relationships with our suppliers  
and there is not significant turnover in our major supplier base. We use a risk-based approach to determine supplier priority for CSR assessment. This considers the risk associated with the supplier’s country of operation, their importance to Nufarm and their industry. 
We have a number of important 
chemical suppliers in China and 
India who were given a high 
priority for CSR assessment based 
on country risk. We recognise our social and environmental impacts extend 
beyond our own business to our suppliers and work with them to achieve the same standards we aspire to ourselves.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 37 Ethical sourcing (continued)
2019 performance 
In 2019 we increased the number  
of existing suppliers that have 
completed annual CSR assessments from 37 percent to 49 percent of total spend across 117 suppliers.  
This metric is measured as the  
spend with assessed suppliers  
as a percentage of total business spend. Our existing suppliers are our most important and continue  
to be the focus of our supply  
chain CSR program. 
New suppliers are subject to  
our supplier code of conduct  
and ongoing evaluation process.  
As they represent a small portion  
of our total spend they have  
not been requested to undertake  
a CSR assessment this year.
Figure 5 – Suppliers in CSR assessment 
program as percentage of total spend
2019 2018 201723%37%49%We also revaluated existing 
suppliers that had previously  
been assessed and found that overall, they had improved their  
CSR performance since their  
first assessment. 
We benchmarked our suppliers’ 
assessment scores with EcoVadis’ extensive number of chemical sector assessments and found  
our suppliers outperformed the sector average across all themes; environment, labour, fair business practices and sourcing.
Of the suppliers we have assessed, 
none were found to have significant actual or potential environmental  
or social impacts in our supply chain this year. We do not consider our suppliers to have a significant risk of incidents of child labour or forced or compulsory labour. We also found no evidence of modern slavery practices in our assessed suppliers this year.
We have not terminated any 
significant business relationships with suppliers on environmental or social grounds this year, however we have mutually agreed corrective action plans with two percent of our assessed suppliers to address  
both social and environmental considerations. These are suppliers who did not reach our minimum internal standards. An additional  
25 percent of our assessed suppliers have self-initiated their own corrective action plans demonstrating a strong drive to 
improve sustainability performance.
Objectives  
for 2020
In 2020 we will 
continue to expand our coverage for supplier CSR assessments.

Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 40 Product stewardship
Integrated Pest 
Management 
We understand the pressures 
farmers face to increase yield  
while minimising impact on the environment and addressing concerns about the sustainability  
of modern agriculture. 
We support integrated pest 
management practices that combine physical, biological  
and chemical methods to provide economically and ecologically sound solutions for pest control. 
We do this by supporting industry 
bodies, such as CropLife, that fund research and education and by providing farmers with tools and training to help them improve the sustainability of farming practices. 
Our major contribution to industry 
knowledge and practice draws  
on our expertise in the area of  
pest resistance management. 
Pest resistance is an ongoing  
threat to global food security  
and a key driver in the need for  
the use of an integrated pest 
management approach. 
We participate in various industry 
initiatives and are involved in research to understand resistance mechanisms. 
In Australia, we sponsor WeedSmart 
(weedsmart.org.au), a program where industry, government and universities have partnered to enhance on-farm practices and promote the long-term, sustainable 
use of herbicides.We have a range of initiatives  
and decision tools to directly 
support and educate farmers in managing herbicide resistance.  
The CATS (CombAt Troublesome weedS) platform in the United States provides comprehensive integrated weed management solutions to help farmers control and prevent  
the development of resistant  
weed populations.
In conjunction with Australian 
growers we developed Weed Logic, a tool that provides growers with a medium-term strategy for sustainable and cost-effective resistance management. 
Through our alliance with  
Farmers Edge, a global leader in 
precision agriculture, we are also helping to provide farmers with access to digital solutions and risk management platforms to help them maximise their crop productivity and profitability while balancing their sustainability goals.
The regulatory 
framework 
The Food and Agriculture 
Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) sets the foundation for the crop protection industry and its regulators, assessing pesticides  
and establishing the minimum standards for their use. 
Regulatory bodies play an 
important role in directly setting  
and enforcing stringent product stewardship standards for  
the industry. Before any agricultural chemical product can be manufactured  
or sold it must be assessed and registered by the relevant  
regulator. Regulatory bodies in major agricultural markets are independent government bodies, such as the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States  
of America, The European Chemicals Agency, and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).  
They conduct product assessments based on extensive evidence-based review of scientific data.
Regulatory assessments typically 
include studies of residue, toxicology, eco-toxicology, environmental effects, product chemistry and efficacy studies and occupational health and safety. 
Regulators consider both published 
and unpublished scientific studies  
in determining whether a product  
is safe for use. 
Based on their assessment, 
regulators decide whether to register the product, specify the conditions under which it is permitted for use, and prescribe specific safety 
precautions and warnings to be included on the product label. 
Once a product has been 
registered for use, regulators  
have the right to reconsider the approval or registration at any time. Reconsideration may be initiated when new research or evidence raises concerns about the use or safety of the product. Regulators may also consider community concerns as part of their review. Product stewardship starts with our support  
for sustainable farming practices and extends  
through our supply chain. 
Nufarm Limited  Sustainability Report 2019 41 Product stewardship (continued)
We engage directly with regulators 
in relation to the registration of our products, or as part of the industry-wide taskforces which generate data and information required  
by regulators.
In some instances regulatory  
bodies in one jurisdiction may 
restrict a product for particular  
use and these bans may not be mirrored in other jurisdictions.  
For instance, neonicitinoids are  
a class of insecticides for which  
the regulatory requirements in Europe vary considerably to the regulatory requirements in other parts of the world. 
Nufarm’s policy is to comply  
with the regulatory requirements  
of each of the markets in which  
we operate. We do not apply the 
regulatory restrictions or approvals of any one jurisdiction across our global business.
Product Development 
Product development starts with understanding emerging crop trends and identifying the needs  
of growers. 
We combine these insights with  
our knowledge of the competitive 
landscape and increasingly stringent regulatory environment  
to develop new products. 
Our product development is 
typically based on existing off-
patent chemistry or new chemistry from industry partners which have been tested and licensed by regulators. We create unique formulations from these products that confer particular benefits  
to end users including efficacy, safety and environmental benefits. Each formulation is then tested  
and registered by the relevant regulatory bodies. Examples of product development that address environmental issues include:
• products with increased concentrations to support  
lower on-field chemical application rates and improve transport efficiency;
• prioritisation of solvents and adjuvants with the lowest ecological profile, and where feasible, natural materials; 
• development of spraying technologies to reduce  
chemical usage; and
• products with improved compatibility to enable farmers to mix different solutions together in the one tank, allowing for fewer sprays, reduced water and fuel usage. 
Throughout our development process our products undergo compliance checks in line with regional regulatory requirements, e.g. REACH compliance in Europe.
Biological solutions
Biological-based crop solutions  
are another tool that can help farmers reduce the impact of farming on the environment. 
Our biological product range  
and pipeline is developed  
through licensing, acquisition and 
development. While our current portfolio is small relative to our overall portfolio, it is growing and we believe it provides attractive alternatives for customers and will help mitigate regulatory product risk over a longer-term time frame. 
The most significant addition to  
our biological portfolio in 2019  
was Trunemco
TM, a biochemical 
and microbial seed treatment for 
soybean, cotton and corn crops. TrunemcoTM primes the plant’s 
physiology and activates its own defence system to protect against nematode invasion. We will work  
to launch this product in 2020. 
Development activities on a  
range of other biological products 
will continue through 2020 and beyond. This will include review  
of further acquisition opportunities, development with other industry partners and early stage  
research organisations.
Product Application 
We support farmers in the efficient use of crop protection products to improve their accuracy and limit unnecessary use.
Our product development 
framework incorporates testing  
the use of different spray nozzles  
so we can provide expert advice  
to growers to improve spraying accuracy by using the best nozzles for application of our products. 
We provide farmers with hands-on 
educational workshops that reinforce good spraying practices, nozzle selection and provide growers with opportunities to  
ask questions.
In Australia, we have invested in 
SprayWise
® Decisions, an internet 
subscription service that helps  
rural landholders and contractors better plan and match the timing  
of chemical applications to prevailing local weather conditions. This helps them to minimise drift  
and its potential unintended impacts, reduce chemical use  
and maximise spray effectiveness.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 42 Manufacture and 
supply chain 
Information on managing the 
environmental footprint of our manufacturing plants is provided  
in the Environment chapter. 
Our approach to supply chain 
management and ensuring  
our raw materials are ethically  
sourced is provided in the  
Ethical Sourcing Chapter. 
Product Quality 
Strict controls around the quality  
of crop protection products are important to ensure the quality  
of farmers’ crops. 
Our quality control systems and 
framework incorporate standards for raw material sourcing and product development to protect human health and minimise environmental risk. 
All products are developed and 
manufactured to strict global  
quality and safety standards.  
These standards were designed with a focus on ensuring our products are safe to use, with industry regulatory requirements  
as the baseline.
Our standards also consider  
grower needs and application 
requirements to ensure we deliver  
a safe, effective product.
We have laboratories and trained 
technicians in all regions to test  
our products to ensure quality  
and safety levels meet the stringent regulatory requirements needed to sell our products around the world. Sustainable packaging
We are working to minimise  
the impact of our packaging through initiatives aimed at  
reducing packaging waste  
and increasing the recycled  
content of our packaging.
Distribution 
Where feasible, we manufacture locally, reducing the cost and environmental impact of transporting liquid products long distances. 
Transport of our products by road, 
rail and sea is very tightly regulated. We use the services of specialist licensed service parties to transport products to supplement our own distribution capabilities. 
We apply United Nations (UN) 
packaging standards to our products to protect them on their journey so they arrive at our customers in the same condition  
as they left our sites.
Safe and Resp onsible Use 
Our products are heavily regulated in all jurisdictions in which they are marketed and sold, including the very specific requirements for product labelling and provision  
of safety data sheets. All of our products have undergone a  
health and safety assessment as a prerequisite for the provision of this safety information for our customers.
Regulatory controls require our 
products to be labelled with the 
active ingredient and its content 
along with any relevant dangerous goods markings. Our safety data sheets provide further detail on  
the chemical composition of the product, safe use instructions and disposal, handling and storage and measures to protect the environment in the case of an accidental spill. We also provide extensive technical information to assist growers to get optimal benefit from our products. 
This is supplemented by training and 
advice on using our products safely and sustainably.
Through our membership of CropLife 
and other industry associations we are also supporting advocacy and education for the safe and sustainable use of crop protection products.
Container management 
and obsolete stock
We take ownership for our product 
packaging through to the end  
of its life by partnering with local service providers and non-profit organisations for the safe collection of empty, used containers. 
These include inpEV in Brazil, 
drumMUSTER in Australia, the  
Ag Container Recycling Council (ACRC) in the United States and 
PAMIRA’s agricultural packaging recovery system in Germany.  
These organisations and others collect used agricultural chemical packaging from farmers and distributors and recycle the materials. Through these mechanisms, we reduce the impact our products have on landfill space and on non-renewable resources.
We have an ongoing project to 
rationalise our product range to reduce obsolete stock and drive efficiencies in our supply chain, reducing waste and impact on  
the environment.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 43 Product stewardship (continued)
Biotechnology-derived 
plant products
Excellence Through Stewardship 
(ETS) is a global industry-coordinated organisation that promotes the universal adoption  
of stewardship programs and quality management systems for  
the full life cycle of biotechnology-derived plant products.
Nuseed, our wholly owned 
subsidiary, belongs to this organisation ensuring our stewardship and quality management systems meet or exceed these internationally-recognised standards. These standards are applied to our biotechnology portfolio globally, including omega-3 canola. 
ETS facilitate third party audits  
of Nuseed’s biotechnology 
processes as part of our continuous improvement process.
Glyphosate
Nufarm purchases glyphosate and formulates it with other chemicals for end use. 
Independent regulators in major 
agricultural markets where Nufarm sells glyphosate have assessed the risks of glyphosate to humans and the environment. These regulators have determined that glyphosate  
is safe to use in accordance with label directions.In 2015 the International Agency  
for Research on Cancer (IARC)  
listed glyphosate as a probable carcinogen in Monographs  
Volume 112. 
The preamble to the Monographs 
explains that the Monographs represent the first step in carcinogen risk assessment and it carefully distinguishes between a cancer “hazard” and a cancer “risk”.  
The preamble defines a cancer ‘hazard’ is an agent that is capable of causing cancer under some circumstances, and a cancer ‘risk’ as an estimate of the carcinogenic effects expected from exposure  
to a cancer hazard. 
The Monograph notes that  
it evaluates cancer hazards  
(not cancer risks). It highlights that 
the distinction between a hazard and risk is important, and that the Monographs identify cancer hazards, even when risks are very low at current exposure levels.
As a result of these definitions,  
many common, everyday products, 
such as aloe vera, pickled vegetables and coconut oil,  
have been identified by IARC  
as probable carcinogens.Regulatory bodies in major agricultural markets have reviewed their assessment of the risk of glyphosate to human health following the IARC decision.  
Each of these regulatory bodies  
has determined that glyphosate  
is safe to use in accordance with label directions. 
In October 2019, the National 
Hazardous Substances Committee in Thailand voted to phase out the use of glyphosate. 
We believe regulatory decisions 
should be independent and based on scientific data. We are confident that the scientific data supports the safety profile of glyphosate and continue to support our customers and farmers who use glyphosate.
Safety Data Sheets that provide 
further information on the safety  
of our glyphosate-based products can be found on the Nufarm website of the country in which  
we sell each product. 
Nufarm Limited  Sustainability Report 2019 44 Nufarm Limited  Sustainability Report 2019 45 Governance and  
ethical conduct
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 46 Governance and ethical conduct 
Board of directors
The governing body of the 
company is the board of directors. 
The board’s responsibility is to 
oversee the company’s operations and ensure that Nufarm carries  
out its business in the best interests  
of all shareholders and with  
proper regard to the interests  
of all other stakeholders. 
The board charter defines the 
board’s individual and collective responsibilities and describes those responsibilities delegated to the managing director and senior executives. A copy of the board charter is available on the corporate governance section of the company’s website. 
Board members are selected based 
on their experience and skills to 
ensure the board properly 
discharges its responsibilities.
There are eight members of  
the board with a majority being 
independent, non-executive directors, in line with the Principles. The exceptions are Greg Hunt  
who is the managing director  
and chief executive officer and Toshikazu Takasaki. 
As a major shareholder in Nufarm, 
Sumitomo’s interests are represented by one board member position, which has been held by Takasaki-san since 2012. 
The board reviews its composition 
and terms of reference annually. It also evaluates the performance and determines remuneration  
of the managing director and  
senior executives. 
Full details of the executive 
remuneration structure are set out  
in the remuneration report on pages 29 to 51 of Nufarm’s 2019 annual financial report.
Board committees
The board is supported by four committees: the audit and risk committee; the nomination and governance committee; the human resources (HR) committee; and the health, safety and environment  
(HSE) committee. 
The HSE committee is responsible  
for reviewing and reporting to the 
board on strategic matters including 
significant environmental and safety issues and, in conjunction with the board, has approved the group’s sustainability strategy.
The responsibilities of the HR 
committee include to review and make recommendations to the board in relation to Nufarm’s board and executive remuneration strategy, structure and practice.
The committee is responsible for 
seeking and approving independent remuneration advisers who will provide independent remuneration advice, as appropriate, on board, chief executive officer and other key management personnel remuneration strategy, structure, practice and disclosure.The HSE and HR committees have joint oversight of Nufarm’s material social aspects while making recommendations to the board  
on matters of policy and practice. 
Copies of both the HSE and HR 
committees’ charters are available on the corporate governance section of the company’s website. Our HSE Policy, which was approved by Nufarm’s CEO, is also available on our website.
The responsibilities of the 
nomination and governance committee include composition of the board, reviewing the mix of skills and diversity on the board and recommending changes to the board membership and whether  
to support the re-election of a retiring director. In conjunction with the human resources committee,  
the nominations and governance committee ensure the diversity policy is applied to the selection  
of board members. In 2019, women comprised 29 percent of the Board’s non-executive directors. 
A copy of the committee’s charter 
and a summary of the policy and procedure for director appointments are available on the corporate governance section of the company’s website.
Each year each board committee 
will self-assess whether it has discharged its responsibilities  
as set out in its charter. Nufarm is committed to high standards of corporate governance and has a range 
of policies and procedures in place to support this aim. Details of board committees and their terms of reference, along with other corporate policies and protocols,  
can be found in the governance section of our website. Nufarm is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and we comply with the third edition of the  
ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (the Principles).
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 47 Governance and ethical conduct  (continued)
Executive leadership
The board has delegated  
authority for the daily management 
of Nufarm’s environmental and social aspects to the executive leadership team. 
Reporting directly to the CEO,  
the group executive for 
manufacturing and supply  
chain, Elbert Prado, is responsible for environment and safety.
Conflict of interest
Board members must identify any conflicts of interest they may have  
in dealing with the company’s affairs and then refrain from participating in any discussion  
or voting on these matters. 
Further information on this policy 
can be found in the board charter, available in the corporate governance section of the company’s website. Directors and senior executives must disclose any related party transaction in writing. 
Information on cross board 
memberships and major 
shareholdings is made publicly 
available to interested parties as  
it arises through our annual financial 
report and statements released  
to the ASX.
Code of conduct
Nufarm’s code of conduct guides 
our work and represents our commitment to fair, ethical and professional business practices  
and legislative requirements. 
We require all Nufarm directors, 
employees, contractors and consultants to be familiar with and uphold the company’s code of conduct in all business dealings. Wherever we operate, the  
health and safety of our people,  
our contribution to sustainable development, and conducting business with integrity are key priorities in delivering value to our shareholders and stakeholders. 
We are politically impartial except 
where the board believes it is necessary to comment due to any perceived major impact on the company, its business or any of  
its stakeholders.
Other policies
Where there are no legislative requirements with which to comply, we develop policy statements to support the code of conduct and ensure appropriate standards  
are met. 
These policies include the 
communications policy, diversity policy, security trading policy and continuous disclosure protocol. 
We have a whistle-blower policy  
to provide employees with a 
confidential mechanism to report any suspected unethical or illegal behaviour. Nufarm’s Code of Conduct and additional policies can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the company’s website.
Our regional legal counsel teams 
provide training at least every  
two years to sales, marketing and procurement management and  
staff covering topics relevant to  
their region such as competition  
law and our anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies. 
Risk management
The board is committed to identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing its material  
business risks. To that end, the board has implemented a sound risk management framework which  
it reviews at least annually to  
ensure its effectiveness.
The board is responsible for the 
oversight of the company’s risk management system. 
The board ensures that appropriate 
policies are in place to ensure compliance with risk management controls and requires management to monitor, manage and report on business risks. 
A dedicated risk management 
system is in place to facilitate management’s ownership, prioritisation and reporting of risks throughout the group. This includes reporting on the status of risks and mitigation across all risk categories.
The board delegates certain 
responsibilities to board committees 
and primarily to its audit and risk committee, which is chaired by  
an independent director. The audit and risk committee’s responsibilities include providing an oversight  
of the effectiveness of Nufarm’s enterprise-wide risk management and internal control framework.  
In so doing, it considers the interests of all relevant stakeholders. 
The company recognises a number 
of operational risks related to its crop protection business including:
• market consolidation;
• climate conditions and seasonality;
• regulatory, freedom to operate, product registration, product use and business sustainability;
• human resources and change management;
• relationships with key suppliers and customers;
• licences and operating permits for manufacturing facilities; and
• liquidity and foreign exchange.
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 48 A detailed list of risks managed  
by Nufarm is set out on pages 19  
to 24 of Nufarm’s 2019 annual 
financial report. 
Further information can be found in 
Nufarm’s audit and risk committee charter and risk oversight and management, both available in the corporate governance section of the company’s website.Critical health, safety and environmental concerns are reported directly to the Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)  
board sub-committee and delegated to the relevant group executive for resolution.
There were no critical environmental 
concerns reported to the HSE sub-committee this year. There have been no new legal actions against the company for anticompetitive behaviour, anti-trust or monopoly practice, and there have been no incidents of corruption this year.

stakeholder  
engagement
Nufarm Limited Sustainability Report 2019 50 Materiality and stakeholder  
engagement
Our stakeholders are those who 
have a direct relationship with  
or who are potentially impacted  
by our activities. They include employees, customers, investors, suppliers, government regulators, local communities and non-government organisations. 
The content included in our 2019 
Sustainability Report has been guided by the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. 
The chapters in this document 
provide detail on sustainability issues we have determined to  
be material to Nufarm following engagement with internal leaders, employees, key partners,  
customers and external analysts.Key topics and concerns raised by stakeholders throughout the year have also been considered when preparing this report. A summary of the areas of interests raised by our stakeholders is included in Table 18.
More information on material  
risks that could impact the 
achievement of our business objectives is provided in our 2019 annual report on pages 19 to 24. 
Materiality Assessment 
In 2017 we completed our first internal materiality assessment  
to evaluate our key sustainability issues. The assessment included  
a survey and review of important issues, from the perspective of internal leaders, employees,  
key partners and customers. This assessment was the first  
step towards a more robust approach to identifying our material sustainability issues  
and the areas our stakeholders considered priorities for disclosure. 
In 2020 we will undertake a further 
materiality assessment extending the scope of the first study by specifically engaging key stakeholder groups on material sustainability topics and overlaying additional insights from our discussions with sustainability  
and financial analysts. The feedback we collect from stakeholders helps shape our  
business strategy and plans by identifying the issues that are  
most material for Nufarm. 
Figure 6 – Material Topics
Safety first culture; Nufarm practices ethical sourcing;
