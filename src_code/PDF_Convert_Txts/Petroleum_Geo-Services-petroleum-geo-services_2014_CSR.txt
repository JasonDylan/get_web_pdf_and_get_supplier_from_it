CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014People Activities in 2014
The Voice of the Employees
The PGS bi-annual Global People Survey uses the Ennova  Employee Index (EEI), a benchmark of employee satisfaction,  
motivation and loyalty in 28 countries. The survey answers two central questions:
 How satisfied, motivated and loyal is a given group  of employees?
 How does a manager create satisfaction, motivation  and loyalty amongst this group of employees?
92% of PGS employees around the world participated, putting us amongst the top 5% in response rate according to the EEI benchmark. High response rates provide a very high level of precision in the results:
 Slight improvement in overall "Corporate Satisfaction"  and "Motivation" (compared to 2012) 
 Good results in most action areas (compared to benchmark) 
 "Reputation", "Immediate Superior" and "Cooperation" are most positive action areas
 "Senior Management" and "Daily Work" rated high in "Satisfaction" and "Motivation"
 "Opportunities for Professional and Personal Development" score, although it increased compared  to 2012, still has room for improvement
For analysis and actions see Looking Ahead
One Culture Grows Offshore
The PGS One Culture initiative, established in 2013, is built around Vessel Management Teams (VMT) which run our marine surveys and projects. Each VMT comprises the most senior offshore managers, both maritime and seismic disciplines, combined with relevant office-based operational functions. Through One Culture we have streamlined how we manage operational risk, and strengthened cross-functional cooperation. 
During 2014, we took this a step further by providing more 
uniform reporting and hierarchy in all functional disciplines within our Operations business.
The VMT has established clearly defined roles and processes 
for monitoring operational and technical risks across the fleet, and mustering adequate resources. They also provide systematic and structured operational and project risk information to senior executive management.
Now, with onboard, vessel and senior vessel management 
teams in place, we are far better positioned to continue to optimize all Operations functions both offshore 
and onshore. This should improve HSEQ and technical 
performance even further, and increase cost-efficiency. 
Risk Management
Health and safety is about managing the risks that our people face on the job. In 2014 we continued to improve  our risk management process:
 Improving toolbox meetings
 Establishing a new process for management  of chemicals
 Utilizing management of change at all organizational levels 
 Ensuring all stakeholder groups onshore and offshore participate in project risk assessment 7
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014Looking Ahead 
To follow up on our PeopleSurvey, line managers will 
engage with their employees through the following:  
 Defining actions and identifying improvement areas
 Unit actions are documented in the 2015 performance contracts, and followed up and evaluated during year-end performance contract reviews 
 In parallel, business area management groups will identify high-level improvement actions
We will continue to strengthen our risk  management approach
 Further evolve project risk assessments
 Expand our focus on vessel risk management 
 Evaluate how HSE management systems can be  made more efficient by simplifying how we workContinuous focus on 
better risk management and project risk assessments will be a key factor in further improving the HSE performance trends.8
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014Environment
The oceans of the world are our working place. 
We operate across the globe in a range of environments from the tropics to the arctic, from developed areas to frontier areas. We share our working place with many others that rely on the oceans for their income or sustenance. It is our responsibility to ensure we generate as much high quality seismic data as possible with the least amount of environmental impact and interference with the activities of other users of the oceans.9

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014Environmental Activities in 2014
In 2014, we further integrated environmental risk 
management into our business processes through the establishment of a global environmental compliance network. This closely monitors scientific advances and changes in regulations in order to improve our environmental risk assessments and survey mitigation plans.
Other activities in 2014:
 A trial of energy monitoring systems on selected vessels 
and improved energy monitoring for offices Further development of passive acoustic monitoring methods  for mammals and testing of sound source verification methodologies
 Defining the PGS environmental strategy  for the next  5 years
PGS assumed the chairmanship of the IAGC Environment Committee in 2014 and will continue to build on the science-based and collaborative approach we have established in the seismic industry. 
Looking Ahead 
PGS will start implementing a new environment strategy for the period 2015 to 2020. Acknowledging that the oceans are our working place, the strategy is centered on our responsibility to conduct our business in a manner that ensures that the world’s oceans remain healthy and productive.
We believe the seismic industry should work more closely 
with academia to promote oceanic research, for example by sharing data and offering our vessels as research platforms. In this way, all PGS surveys have the potential to create additional value for society. Our goals are: Effective and efficient environmental risk management using best available techniques
 Promoting and supporting oceanic research through academic partnerships and sharing environmental data
During 2015 we will re-align our environmental management system to support the new strategy and we look forward to sharing more information and updates as we do so.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014Conduct
Our reputation and our future depend on 
our compliance with local and international legislation. Operating in the oil and gas industry around the world exposes us to potential corruption risk. That is why it is important to PGS that we conduct our business with integrity and strong ethics. Through its Core Values and Code of Conduct, PGS is committed to a high level of accountability and transparency in all its business dealings. 12
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014Conduct Initiatives 
in 2014
PGS is committed to fighting corruption. In 2014 we 
continued our efforts to ensure that employees and business partners know our standards, and are familiar with relevant PGS policies and procedures for how we engage with people when we do business. Our anti-corruption program is compliant with all international regulations and laws. In 2014, we paid special attention to:
 Employee awareness training and practical guidance
 Regular monitoring of areas highly exposed to  corruption risk
Looking Ahead 
In addition to the anti-corruption monitoring controls,  we have planned the following activities for 2015:
 Compliance training, including E-learning,  face-to-face, train the trainer
 Global corruption risk assessments
 Anti-corruption effectiveness survey
 Revise and update anti-corruption policies  and proceduresEmployees Who Have Completed

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014Stakeholders
Our future business depends on maintaining 
good relations with the people who depend on us. We aim to nurture these stakeholders through transparent two-way communication, to increase mutual understanding and encourage positive relationships that benefit all parties. Our stakeholders include owners, employees and employee groups, customers, suppliers, industry organizations, local communities, non-governmental organizations and governments.14
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014Stakeholder 
Activities in 2014
Supply chain management 
Supplier selection procedures are a key component of our risk management and compliance activities, and all our suppliers are regularly evaluated. We further developed our pre-qualification procedure during 2014. We focus on dialogue and meet regularly with key strategic suppliers to align business plans, identify opportunities and improve performance. 
Purpose built support vessels 
Sourcing good support vessels is a challenge. In 2012 we initiated a project with Thor ltd, a support vessel provider,  to purpose build and charter four new support vessels. Our aim was to establish a long-term relationship, where PGS supports the financing of the vessels through long-term charter, and in return Thor provide vessels based on our specific requirements. In the process we have exchanged knowledge and competence, and our systems have achieved a higher standard. PGS’ proactive approach with this supplier is producing benefits for both companies.  
Sponsorships and contributions 
PGS has two main sponsorship areas. The first is with the Abel Foundation a part of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, to increase mathematics excellence in Norway and West Africa. The other is new and focuses on ocean preservation and research. In addition, various local sponsoring initiatives have been run by our local offices. PGS also contributes to different industry related programs. Read more about these on our web page:  www.pgs.com/Responsibility
Looking Ahead 
Key activities in 2015 will include introduction of supplier performance scorecards, and development of centralized management of charity initiatives. We will build closer relationships with ocean research organizations supporting our environment strategy. 3 803
