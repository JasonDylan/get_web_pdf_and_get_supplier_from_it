Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportKeeps Operations Running to Supply Customers and Provides Needed Medical 
Oxygen During COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges 
across the globe � Throughout the crisis, Air Products has  
continued to work with customers and governments to provide 
critical industrial gases, including emergency medical oxygen, 
while staying focused on keeping our employees safe �
Prompted by early spikes in the number of cases of COVID-19, 
some local hospitals in countries where we operate were forced 
to scramble to cope with large numbers of patients by setting 
up temporary facilities � Air Products worked with local  
officials in several countries to deliver and install  
infrastructure to provide medical oxygen at temporary 
“pop-up” medical facilities �
In the U �S�, Air Products delivered and installed medical oxygen  
equipment at the Miami Beach Convention Center’s temporary  
hospital in Florida, providing the hospital with much needed 
oxygen within 72 hours � The Company undertook a similar 
effort to provide medical oxygen and related equipment to a 
temporary hospital at the U �S� Tennis Association’s Billie Jean 
King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York City �
Air Products also enabled the supply of medical oxygen to field 
hospitals across Europe � In the United Kingdom, Air Products’ 
teams worked with the National Health Service (NHS) to 
quickly get medical oxygen supplies installed at the Nightingale Hospital in Birmingham � Similar installations were 
completed for the NHS Louisa Jordan Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland and for the Ifema (Madrid) and Valladolid  
Hospitals in Spain � 
The Company and its employees provided additional support to communities around the world for COVID-19 relief �  
In China, the Air Products Foundation awarded a $100,000 grant to One Foundation to assist in COVID-19 recovery  
efforts � Similarly, Air Products Korea donated approximately $85,000 to the non-profit Community Chest of Korea  
for medical supplies to aid in preventing COVID-19 from spreading and to assist underprivileged citizens in the  
community � Support of those in need also was a goal of donations in India where employees made contributions to 
the PM Cares Fund and our Kochi facility provided groceries to 750 families in its neighborhood and personal  
protective equipment (PPE) for workers and volunteers at the community kitchen sponsored by the local government �
While continuing to serve its customers, Air Products implemented additional safety protocols aimed at keeping  
employees safe � With a pandemic response plan in place prior to COVID-19, we were able to move quickly � Some of 
these actions included having employees work from home whenever possible, while keeping Company offices and

7Air Products’ higher purpose is to bring people together to collaborate and 
innovate solutions to the world’s most significant energy and environmental 
sustainability challenges � 
Industrial Gases – Essential to Modern Life
Industrial gases are used to make materials that go into our homes and  
businesses, cars and fuels, health care, food and more � Their use also helps 
companies across many industries to improve yields, reduce energy  
consumption and lower emissions � 
For example, our oxy-fuel burners enable glass and metal manufacturers to 
efficiently use oxygen in their production processes, thereby reducing the 
amount of fuel needed and emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx)� Our gases and 
technologies also contribute to the circular economy by enabling the use, or 
recycling of, resources and reducing emissions to the environment �
As the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen, we provide vast quantities of  
hydrogen to petroleum refiners to lower sulfur content and enable the  
production of cleaner-burning gasoline and diesel fuels, significantly  
reducing vehicle emissions by people around the world� We are also a leader 
in hydrogen for mobility and fueling infrastructure and are bolstering the  
hydrogen economy and energy transition in many global regions � In addition, 
we remain a leader in liquefied natural gas equipment, air separation plants, 
and hydrocarbon recovery and purification equipment �We live our purpose through our 
business strategy and our efforts to 
protect the environment and care for 
our stakeholders � These are the  
underlying concepts of our Grow  
– Conserve – Care  sustainability 
approach shared throughout this 
Report �
Sustainability is embedded in our 
business strategy, which is focused 
on serving energy, environmental 
and emerging markets � Our strategy 
is evidenced through the products, 
technologies, and services we offer, 
and the projects we carry out � Our 
products and technologies are  
supported by our innovation  
capabilities and our desire to  
collaborate on real solutions for our  
customers and the world� Our  
core competency is our ability to  
develop, execute, own, and operate  
complex process facilities that  
can transform local economies � 
Sustainability creates our 
growth opportunities, and our 
growth opportunities support 
our sustainability focus and 
goals. We believe that solving 
sustainability challenges is 
good business and the right 
thing to do.
Our products enable our  
customers to be more  
productive and efficient –  
to make more with less while 
reducing their impact on the 
environment. We estimate 
that in 2020 our products  
enabled our customers and 
their customers to avoid the  
equivalent of 72 million  
metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions. This figure is three 
times our own direct and  
indirect CO2 emissions.Our Purpose and StrategyData & Index Communities Employees Climate Environment Customers Strategy ContentsAddressing the World’s Need for Clean Energy  
and Materials
Our technologies for gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility and energy transition put us at the 
center of one of the greatest global challenges and opportunities today: addressing the world’s need for clean energy 
and materials while reducing environmental impacts � As a result, we are developing and delivering some of the  
largest and most complex projects in the history of Air Products while fulfilling our core values of safety and  
integrity and providing reliability and operational excellence to our customers � 
Gasification 
We view gasification as one of the many tools necessary to help countries and customers meet the world’s growing 
need for cleaner, sustainable chemicals and materials � Utilizing our leading gasification technology  
as part of world-class projects, Air Products supports development around the globe by directly and indirectly  
growing local economies and enabling plentiful, local resources to be converted into high-value chemicals and  
materials �  
Gasification plants typically convert low-value fossil feedstocks like  
coal and petcoke to useful chemicals and energy while significantly  
reducing pollutants like sulfur oxides that are harmful to human  
health � The process produces carbon dioxide as a by-product that  
can be easily captured in a concentrated form, providing a pathway  
to reduce emissions where market conditions support carbon  
sequestration or utilization � New gasification technologies continue  
to emerge, opening routes to alternative feedstocks such as  
sustainable biomass and the use of waste materials in support  
of the circular economy �
Natural gas is often considered an important part of the energy transition � As the global leader in liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) technology and equipment, Air Products’ LNG offerings are vital to helping meet the world’s increasing  
energy needs and desire for clean energy � Our technology and equipment, which are at the heart of an LNG  
production plant, are some of the moste efficient available � Our technology takes natural gas and unlocks its value by 
liquefying it and making it possible to economically transport it � The LNG is eventually re-gasified and used as a fuel�  
Air Products is also developing new, low-carbon intensity liquefaction processes to provide innovative solutions  
to the energy transition �
For over 50 years Air Products has manufactured LNG heat exchangers that are operated in 20 countries around the 
world� In 2020, we announced several agreements to provide our proprietary LNG technology, equipment and related 
process technology and advisory services to customers, including heat exchangers for Sonatrach’s LNG facility in 
Algeria and equipment to Qatargas for the North Field East Project in the State of Qatar �

Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability Report9
Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportCarbon Capture 
Carbon footprint reduction is a core  
part of Air Products’ growth strategy  
and sustainability goals � We view  
carbon capture as a necessary and  
high-impact way to tackle climate change and essential to meeting the Paris 
climate goals and beyond� At the same time, we understand that  
implementation of carbon capture requires supportive policies and  
favorable project economics, and strong partnerships with governments  
and our customers �
Capturing carbon and storing it underground is effective but requires  
amenable geology and often relies on government support � Using captured 
CO2 for enhanced oil recovery is a proven, viable option � Air Products is  
developing proprietary carbon dioxide storage and utilization technologies 
that we plan to deploy in high return carbon capture projects �
We see many opportunities for carbon capture � For example, the CO2  
from gasifiers is capture ready and can be used for many purposes or  
sequestered as needed� Likewise, CO2 can be captured from hydrogen plants 
as demonstrated by our Port Arthur, Texas CO2 purification and capture 
project � This facility, the largest of its type in the industrial gas industry, was 
designed and constructed by Air Products to capture CO2 from two steam 
methane reformers � Through 2020, the facility has captured nearly 7 million 
tons of CO2 that is transported by pipeline and then used for enhanced oil 
recovery �
Indonesia has stated its commitment to building a prosperous and sustainable future for its people, supported 
by its plentiful natural resources � With a heavy reliance on fuel imports, but plentiful domestic coal to sustain the 
energy demands of a large and growing nation, there is a great opportunity, and need, to secure sustainable and 
innovative solutions that derive more value from the country’s resources � We believe that gasification, the process 
of converting coal to cleaner, higher value methanol and other chemicals, is an important element of the solution 
for Indonesia� 
As a global pioneer and leader in coal gasification, Air Products brings world leading technology, expertise, and 
capabilities to our new US$2 billion coal-to-methanol gasification production facility in Bengalon, East  
Kalimantan � Identified as a national strategic priority by the Indonesian government, the facility is the first of  
its kind in Indonesia and offers a better and cleaner use for coal� The  
methanol produced by it will be capable of being used in a range of  
greener, more valuable products, such as biofuels, which are in high  
demand and strategically important to the country � While the process does  
produce CO2, it produces significantly less than would be emitted through  
more traditional uses of coal, and it also removes harmful substances such 
as sulfur oxides and particulate emissions �Gasification for World-Scale Methanol Production
Air Products’ gasification technology 
also can support the transition to 
lower-carbon chemical production 
by providing high process and energy 
efficiency, a critical first step in  
lowering industrial carbon emissions, 
and by using Air Products-developed 
carbon capture, utilization, and 
storage technology � These benefits 
are especially valuable in countries 
where development and utilization 
of local resources are closely tied to 
improving local living standards �
Air Products enables large-scale  
gasification projects that produce 
chemical building blocks, which 
customers use to create high-value 
products like chemicals and  
materials, hydrogen, fertilizers,  
and transportation fuels �  
Construction of world-scale  
gasification facilities is underway, 
including a facility in Jiangsu  
Province, China that will produce 
syngas for ammonia and other  
products, and a facility in Hohhot, 
China that will produce syngas for 
ethylene glycol production �
Data & Index Communities Employees Climate Environment Customers Strategy ContentsAir Products developed the technology enabling the capture of CO2 at 
Port Arthur and we plan to deploy this technology for more projects � 
Our CO2 vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) technology captures CO2 
from hydrogen in a single step, producing a high-purity CO2 stream 
ready for use or storage � This technology solves a key issue related to 
carbon capture – that the CO2 available is often at low pressures and 
concentrations, making capture difficult and expensive � 
We are also evaluating numerous other carbon capture projects �  
For example, the Company is developing CO2 capture for its  
operations in Rotterdam, in cooperation with the Porthos Project, 
which will transport CO2 from industry in the area and store it in 
empty gas fields beneath the North Sea� These developments aim to 
be significant contributors to the goals of the ‘Klimaatakoord,’ the 
climate agreement announced by the Dutch government in 2019 
pursuant to which the Netherlands aims to reduce its CO2 emissions 
by 49% from 1990 levels by 2030 � These efforts are in line with  
Air Products’ ambitions to reduce carbon emissions intensity �
Hydrogen for Mobility and the Energy Transition
As the world’s largest hydrogen producer, Air Products has  
experience across the full value chain for hydrogen � We have the 
capability and know-how to make hydrogen through all available 
production methods and to distribute and dispense this increasingly 
important fuel� We have a fleet of over 110 hydrogen production  
facilities with nearly 9,000 tons per day of capacity �  From small  
on-site generators, to world-scale steam methane reformers, to  
electrolyzers used to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen,  
hydrogen production is core to Air Products’ business � We expect  
that hydrogen will play an increasingly significant role in meeting  
society’s need for sustainable transportation, especially for heavy 
duty vehicles where hydrogen excels compared to other  
technologies �
Reliable supply of hydrogen is a key element of the hydrogen 
economy � Air Products is a leader in hydrogen fueling infrastructure 
development, with proven capabilities to distribute hydrogen safely 
and economically � We supply hydrogen to 
our customers using specialized trucks and 
dedicated pipelines, including the world’s 
largest hydrogen supply pipeline network 
and system located in the U �S� Gulf Coast � We 
also have developed a comprehensive suite 
of hydrogen fueling infrastructure solutions 
including retail dispensing of hydrogen that 
mirrors traditional consumer gasoline fueling �Carburos Metálicos, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Air Products, has signed 
an agreement with ENSO (Bioeléctrica 
de Garray) to capture and clean CO2 
produced by ENSO’s plant in Soria, Spain 
that uses biomass as fuel� In turn, the 
plant will provide the power and heat 
required for Air Products’ process, using 
a circular economy approach �
After being processed, the CO2 will  
be supplied to our customers that  
previously received CO2 from a different  
Air Products facility that was farther 
away and used a different production 
technology � As a result, Air Products 
expects to avoid emitting several  
thousands of tons of CO2 to the  
atmosphere every year and  
approximately 100,000 kilometers in 
road transport and associated  
emissions �
The project is being financially  
supported by the European Union’s LIFE 
Programme, created in 1992 to boost  
the achievement of environmental  
and climate action goals �Carburos Metálicos 
Builds an Innovative 
CO2 Capture, Cleaning 
and Use Plant
10 Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportData & Index Communities Employees Climate Environment Customers Strategy ContentsBecause of our decades of experience, Air Products is well positioned to meet the 
growing demand for low and zero carbon hydrogen fuel in support of global  
emissions reduction targets � As a demonstration of this capability, we completed or 
announced several hydrogen projects in 2020, including:
• Air Products’ investment in the largest liquid hydrogen  
   plant in China, which is expected to start-up in 2022;  
• Our first hydrogen fueling station in Korea located at  
   Ulsan, one of three hydrogen demonstration cities in  
   the country;
• Inaugurating new hydrogen fueling stations in  
   Saudi Arabia and Spain; and
• Expanding use of the hydrogen filling station at  
   Heathrow Airport in London to consumers and taxis �
We believe world-scale projects are required to rapidly reduce the cost of green  
hydrogen and more quickly help the world reduce its carbon footprint � To that end, 
we have announced a $5 billion joint venture with ACWA Power and NEOM, to build 
a world-scale green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility  
powered by renewable energy in NEOM� We are committed to  
support the transition to hydrogen �
NEOM, a new model for sustainable living located in Saudi Arabia, is the site of the world-scale green  
hydrogen-based ammonia project that will enable Air Products to produce carbon-free hydrogen to power  
buses and trucks around the globe � 
The joint venture project with NEOM and ACWA Power is based on proven, world-class technology and will include: 
the innovative integration of around four gigawatts of renewable power through solar, wind and storage; production 
of 650 tons per day of hydrogen by electrolysis; production of nitrogen by air separation using Air Products’  
technology; and production of 1�2 million tons per year of carbon-free ammonia using Haldor Topsoe technology 
through Air Products’ global alliance agreement �
The project is scheduled to be onstream in 2025 � Air Products will be the exclusive off-taker of the green ammonia 
and plans to invest an additional $2 billion downstream, bringing Air Products’ total investment to $3 �7 billion �  
Air Products expects to transport the green ammonia around the world to be dissociated to produce green hydrogen 
for the transportation market with the potential to eliminate three million tons per year of CO2 emissions as well as 
smog-forming emissions and other pollutants from the equivalent of over 700,000 cars �
NEOM is a transformative and innovative project based on proven, world-class technology – representing a massive 
change in how the world gets its energy for mobility � We believe that many more of these types of projects will be 
required to scale-up for the hydrogen economy �World’s Largest Green Hydrogen

Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportImproving the efficiency of combustion processes is a key consideration for glass and metals industries � Air Products’ 
natural gas and oxygen pre-heating technology can significantly increase the energy efficiency of oxyfuel combus-
tion in glass melting applications � In such processes, a significant amount of waste heat is generated as a byproduct 
of furnace operation and leaves the process through the flue gas � The energy in the flue gas can be used to  
preheat the incoming natural gas and oxygen to the 
optimum temperature, thus reducing the energy 
requirements for overall furnace operation � The 
preheating can result in up to an 8-10% efficiency 
improvement for our customers and, when com -

We also encourage suppliers to incorporate environmental sustainability into their operations and supply chains as 
described in the principles outlined in our Sustainability Expectations of our suppliers � Additional supplier  
requirements are provided in the Care section of this Report �
Efficient Use of Resources
The principal raw materials for making atmospheric gases and hydrogen are air, energy as electricity or steam and 
natural gas � Air, which is considered by many to be a renewable resource, represents more than 90% of the raw 
materials we use on a weight basis � Similarly, 80% of the raw material used for our carbon dioxide business is from 
renewable sources �
Industrial gas manufacturing is energy intensive � ASUs require electricity or steam to compress air so it can be  
cryogenically distilled into oxygen, nitrogen, and argon � Likewise, the production of hydrogen consumes natural gas, 
and in some cases refinery off-gas, as a feedstock and/or fuel in the production process � 
Packaging is not a significant issue for Air Products because we supply most of our products in two-way bulk  
containers, semi-bulk containers or via pipelines � For small-scale supply in certain regions of the world, we use cylin -
ders that are long life, returnable, and reusable transportable pressure vessels with typical life spans of 20+ years �

Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportWhy It’s Important
Energy consumption and CO2  
emissions are inextricably linked� We 
believe that the world needs clean, 
sustainable energy – energy that 
protects our environment and moves 
us all toward a better future �What We’re Doing
We believe a diverse mix of solutions is needed to meet clean energy needs 
while reducing GHGs � For example, we supply vast quantities of hydrogen 
to petroleum refiners to lower sulfur content and produce cleaner-burning 
gasoline and diesel fuels � Likewise, our oxyfuel burners improve productivity 
for glass and metal manufacturers while reducing energy consumption and 
emissions � We have leading technologies for gasification, carbon capture and 
hydrogen for mobility and the broader energy transition �
The production of industrial gases is energy intensive, which is why we have 
continually increased the energy efficiency of our ASU and HyCO facilities 
through improved plant designs and efficient operations � These efforts also 
reduce CO2 emissions and water consumption � In fact, improving energy  
efficiency is one of the five mechanisms we are focused on in order to meet 
our new “Third by ‘30” CO2 intensity reduction goal�
Energy consumption is the most significant variable in the cost of our  
production processes � We carefully track and manage energy purchases, and 
our conservation programs are focused on continually improving energy  
efficiency across our plants, particularly larger facilities � Efficiency  
improvements are realized through higher plant utilization, increased 
production at new, larger, and more efficient facilities and through facility 
improvement projects � Several of our facilities have been certified to the ISO 
50001 Energy Standard�

Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportOur Commitments and Contributions
We met most of our environmental sustainability goals in 2020 (from a 2015 baseline year)� Specifically:
•   We exceeded our goal to reduce energy use intensity by 2�5% for ASUs, realizing a 3 �3% improvement � We were  
unable to fulfill our 1�5% energy efficiency goal for HyCOs due to lower product demand in 2020 �
•   We met our goal to reduce GHG emissions intensity by achieving a 2� 6%  reduction �
•   We significantly improved the distribution efficiency of our fleet and exceeded our goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 
10%, reaching a 20% reduction �
•   We exceeded our goal to conserve water and lower use intensity by 5%, reducing water intensity by 26%�
We have established a significant goal to reduce CO2 emissions intensity by  
one-third by 2030 from a 2015 baseline year � We have also established a resource  
conservation goal, striving to continue increasing the energy efficiency of our  
operations, which supports our CO2 emissions intensity goal and reduces water  
consumption � We also will continue our work to conserve water, especially in  
areas where water is stressed�
Carbon productivity is a measure of how much value is generated from the consumption of energy. We are 
working to improve our carbon productivity through several mechanisms including: improving the energy 
efficiency of our production processes and product distribution; increasing our use of renewable energy; 
pursuing opportunities to further deploy our carbon capture technology and expertise; and enabling our 
customers and their customers to avoid CO2 emissions. Below are carbon productivity results for 2020, with

towards our new “Third by ‘30” CO2 emissions intensity reduction goal� In 
2020, we increased procurement and on-site generation of renewable energy �
We purchase renewable electricity directly through our energy suppliers or  
by buying Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) that link our power  
consumption to a specific asset that generates renewable electricity �  
For example, in 2020 we signed a long-term agreement to purchase  
electricity from a new large-scale solar plant in the southwest U �S� for a large 
ASU � We also purchase renewable electricity directly in the United Kingdom, 
and through Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs), a type of REC�  
In other parts of Europe, the RECs are called Guarantees of Origin (GOs) that 
demonstrate the electricity we use comes from renewable sources � Carburos 
Metálicos, our wholly owned subsidiary in Spain, began procuring GOs for  
its production plants in 2020 � We also continued to purchase electricity  
covered by GOs in France and are moving towards monthly matching of  
electricity production and consumption related to the GOs � We also have 
linked to ENGIE’s The Energy Origin (TEO), a blockchain approach that  
substantiates the renewable origin of the electricity we consume and is  
the first renewable energy blockchain to be validated by an independent 
third-party �48.2

Supporting the Energy Transition
The world faces a huge challenge in shifting toward clean, sustainable  
energy sources � Air Products supports its customers in executing their  
energy strategies to promote economic growth and social development �  
We recognize that carbon-based fuels will continue to be instrumental for 
the equitable development of the global economy and can employ our  
gasification and carbon capture technologies where needed� As the  
world transitions to lower carbon energy sources, our hydrogen and LNG 
technologies and products enable our customers to reduce emissions from 
legacy energy sources while they pursue new sources of energy for their  
operations and manufacturing processes � Please see the GROW section of 
this Report for details on these businesses and our view on their benefits ��
Improving Distribution Efficiency
We have trucking fleets around the world that are focused on safely and  
efficiently delivering our products to our customers � To improve our  
distribution efficiency and reduce our Scope 1 CO2 emissions, we have many 
initiatives underway, including investments in new trucks, trailers,  
technology, and facilities � 
Continuing efforts to modernize our fleets with new, more efficient trucks 
have increased fuel efficiency � Distribution efficiency has also been improved 
through the addition of trailers with higher payloads � We continue to run 
trials on trucks that use alternative fuels – LNG, CNG, electricity and diesel-
electric hybrids – and look forward to using hydrogen as a fuel for our trucks � 
We also have increased the number of hybrid cars in our vehicle fleet �Technology is key to improving  
distribution efficiency and we are  
using data to help our drivers be 
more agile in addressing driving  
parameters that they can control 
such as revving and idling � This is 
complemented by improvements in 
scheduling that improve efficiency, 
reduce miles, and decrease return 
trips � We are also investing in new 
distribution facilities, such as our 
Reichstett depot near Strasbourg, 
France to optimize delivery to  
medical customers in the region  
and thus reduce our CO2 emissions �
We exceeded our 2020 distribution 
efficiency goal, reducing fleet-related 
CO2  emissions in 2020 more than 
20% compared to our target of a 10% 
reduction in emissions (from a 2015 
baseline year)�
Climate Scenario Analysis
Scenario analysis is a tool that  
evaluates the potential effects of 
future events on an organization, 
such as climate change � Air Products 
has continued to evaluate climate 
scenarios that are in line with the 
recommendations of the  
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) and Task Force for 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), examining potential climate-

Why It’s Important
Water is critical to the health and 
sustainability of our world� Unlike  
climate change, water is a local 
concern as consumers rely on nearby 
sources for this important resource � 
Efforts to conserve water are needed, 
particularly in areas where water 
demand exceeds supply �
Water Consumed*
* Includes water discharged but not returned to sourceWhat We’re Doing
We use water primarily for cooling, to make hydrogen using the steam  
methane reforming (SMR) process, and to provide steam and water to our 
customers � The steam is a co-product of our SMRs and has a significant  
energy efficiency advantage and related environmental benefits when  
compared to steam generated in boilers � 
Because of these uses, our water consumption is tied closely to energy use; 
therefore, improvements in energy efficiency can also reduce water  
consumption � We have also saved water by improving cooling tower  
operations and converting to recycled gray water in our plants, particularly in 
Southern California where water is stressed� Across our plants, we estimate 
that 7% of our water was from recycled sources in 2020 �
Our Commitments and Contributions
In 2016, Air Products established a goal to reduce water consumption by 5% 
on an indexed basis by 2020 from a 2015 baseline � We achieved this goal in 
2017 and continued to improve water efficiency through subsequent years, 
reducing our water intensity by 4% in 2020 compared to 2019 for a total 
reduction of 26% since the baseline year �
Our consumption of water, 
on an absolute basis,  
decreased to 14.4 billion  
gallons in 2020 due to  
increased water recycling 
and lower power demand. 
Additional data on water 
withdrawals, consumption 
and discharges is provided in

14.4  
billion
gallonsFor several years, Air Products has worked with SUEZ - Water Technologies & Solutions to improve water use  
efficiency at our facilities, primarily through effective management of cooling towers � We use water to remove heat 
from our processes, which are energy intensive � This water is cooled in towers where the heat is transferred from the 
water that flows downwards to air that is flowing upwards � Efficient operation of cooling towers can substantially 
decrease the amount of water or “blowdown” that must be removed from the cooling towers to maintain necessary 
operating conditions � Reducing blowdown significantly reduces water consumption �
Working together, Air Products and SUEZ have optimized cooling tower operations and reduced water use at many 
sites � Plant trials – where water recycling was increased in the cooling towers and treatment methods were adjusted 
– improved operations and reduced water consumption � The adjustments also improved heat transfer efficiency and 
reduced power consumption and maintenance � Since 2016, Air Products has saved over 200 million gallons of water 
(cumulatively) in North America by collaborating with SUEZ to improve our cooling tower operations �Collaborating to Conserve Water  
We construct our facilities on or near customer sites to  
enable products to be distributed efficiently. As a result, 
some of our operations are in water stressed areas, par-
ticularly areas where the baseline water stress is high or 
extremely high according to the World Resources Institute 
Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. In 2020, 22% of our facilities, 
based on the number of sites, were in water stressed areas.
In addition to improving energy efficiency, we are also  
committed to the responsible use of water. We have made 
significant progress in reducing water use intensity at our 
ASU and HyCO facilities since 2009 and will continue to do so 
through energy efficiency improvements and conservation 
projects that will focus on areas where water is stressed. We 
also will continue to increase our understanding of the water 
required for our megaprojects and identify areas where we can 
make meaningful progress in conserving water.

Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportWaste
Industrial gas production does  
not generate significant waste � 
Hazardous waste generation from 
acetylene manufacturing results in  
a by-product lime slurry � This slurry  
is often beneficially reused in  
other processes, such as water  
neutralization, brick production and 
in hardening materials in landfills �
Other sources of hazardous waste 
include spent catalysts, waste oils 
and solvents, waste paint and  
materials used to cleanup small 
spills � All waste is managed and 
treated in accordance with the  
regulatory requirements of the  
jurisdiction in which the waste is 
generated� Waste that cannot be 
recycled is disposed of in an  
environmentally sound and  
regulatory compliant manner � 
In 2020, the amount of hazardous 
waste we generated globally was 14 
million pounds, and our non-hazard-
ous waste in North America totaled 
11�1 million pounds � Hazardous waste 
volumes increased in 2020 due to 
recycling of used cylinders � Additional 
waste data is provided in the GRI 
Content Index �Environmental Compliance
Regulatory fines decreased in 2020 to $3,300 and 17 notices of violation were 
received in FY20 compared to 14 the prior year � There were no reportable 
spills �
Air Emissions
The manufacture of atmospheric gases produces negligible Scope 1 and other 
air emissions � Most of our air emissions are from hydrogen manufacturing 
and utility operations that support our facilities � We monitor and report air 
emissions in accordance with applicable regulations � 
•   NOx and SOx are products of combustion and are primarily from fuel used 
in our boilers and SMRs � 
•  Other air pollutants result from the minor loss of materials used in our  
processes or solvents used in the maintenance of equipment that include 
toxics under the U �S� EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program, other  
criteria pollutants, hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and volatile organic 
chemicals (VOCs)�
Additional data on air emissions is provided in the GRI Content Index to  
this Report �
Ozone Depleting Substances and Fluorinated Gases
Air Products does not manufacture ozone depleting substances, fluorinated 
gases or refrigerants � We do sell gas mixtures that contain small quantities  
of these substances, as well as some pure refrigerants, as permitted by  
applicable regulations � We also recover, recycle, and reclaim fluorinated gases 
for destruction �
Biodiversity
Early in the planning stages of any new capital investment, from new plants 
or expansions to pipelines, we assess safety, human health, socioeconomic, 
cultural, and environmental impacts � These assessments can influence  
decisions to modify a project or develop mitigation strategies to ensure  
the ecological health of the location and region is maintained or  
enhanced� Likewise, our construction practices focus on preserving the  
local environment by reducing the likelihood of spills or negative  
effects from runoff �
Air Products discharges water into eight Conservation International Biodi-
versity Hotspots including: the Atlantic Forest, California Floristic Province, 
Chilean Winter Rainfall and Valdivian Forests, Indo-Burma, Mediterranean 
Basin, Sundaland, Tropical Andes and Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena� The water 
discharged into these locations in 2020 was insignificant �

employees in over 50 countries, Air Products established these new targets 
following analysis of our global employee representation metrics and future 
talent needs as well as by assessing industry benchmarks and peer  
companies � While these goals are specific to women and minorities, our  
DIB efforts are focused on all of our employees as we work to be the most 
diverse industrial gas company in the world�Talent and Diversity
I truly believe that the only 
element of long-term,  
competitive advantage is  
the degree of commitment 
and motivation of the people 
in the enterprise. So, the only 
way to have a competitive 
advantage is to create an  
environment, a culture, 
where your people want to 
come to work and contribute 
to a higher purpose. ”

enhanced training opportunities for employees �
Our development competencies are aligned with our “4S” culture of Safety, 
Speed, Simplicity, and Self-Confidence � Every employee focuses on  
mastering nine core competencies and receives an annual coaching

Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportDiversity in the Workplace 
Air Products diversity in the workplace data continues to see positive trends as we increased the percentage of 
women in executive roles and U �S� minorities in management � 
We continued to engage with external diversity partners to support talent development within their  
organizations and our own � Though much of the engagement in 2020 was virtual due to COVID-19, our dedicated 
employees attended numerous conferences, acted as mentors, and continued building out alumni networks �  
Recruiting via virtual conferences, including for NACME, NSBE, SHPE and SWE (as defined on the next page)  
was highly successful and the relationships with our external diversity partners continue to grow � 
In 2020, Air Products was again recognized for strong performance in Diversity and Inclusion, including earning a 
100% score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2020 Corporate Equality Index for the fourth  
consecutive year �  
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging 
As we work to be the most diverse industrial gas company in the world, we are building a workforce that reflects the 
places we do business, fully utilizing the diversity of the talent pool, and fostering a respective and inclusive culture 
so that employees seek out diverse perspectives, feel empowered to confidently express their viewpoints and create 
meaningful change in support of our higher purpose �
As societal tensions across the globe increased in 2020, the Air Products community stood together against racism 
and hate � We underscored our belief that every person has the fundamental right to be treated with dignity and  
respect � By engaging employees in multiple regions in listening sessions, colleagues were able to increase their 
awareness and understanding of these issues and work together on action plans to further build inclusion �

in the U �S� and Canada, and we are evaluating ways to potentially expand 
the scope � Through the program, employees can notify the Company if they 
believe they have been discriminated against outside of the workplace and 
an Air Products attorney will engage external legal counsel on his/her behalf � 
If there is sufficient evidence to move forward, Air Products will cover  
the external legal costs �

opportunities �
In 2020, our efforts focused on addressing the many impacts of the  
COVID-19 pandemic � We provided significant grants to support basic needs 
for the unsheltered, hungry, and unemployed, particularly in urban areas �  
We connected our employees to non-profits, virtually, to provide mentoring 
and advice regarding business processes related to accounting, finance,

Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportThousands of suppliers are essential to our success � We work with quality 
suppliers who help Air Products deliver value and excellent service to our 
customers and who share in our commitment to ethical business practices � 
All suppliers are expected to abide by and conform to our Code of Conduct 
in their business dealings with us and to support sustainability through the 
principles outlined in our Sustainability Expectations of Suppliers, which 
include environmental, human rights and community considerations �
In total, Air Products spent almost $6 billion in power, equipment,  
materials, and services with nearly 30,000 unique suppliers and service  
providers in 2020 � Energy is the primary raw material purchased to  
manufacture industrial gases, particularly electricity and steam for our  
ASUs, and natural gas for our HyCO plants � Steel, aluminum, and capital 
equipment subcomponents are the primary materials procured for our 
equipment business � There were no significant changes in our supply  
chain year-over-year � 
Because Air Products operates regionally, our procurement teams are  
primarily local to our businesses and work with regional and local suppliers � 
In addition, our corporate team supports procurement of capital equipment 
to construct large industrial gas production facilities and other global  
projects �
The supplier qualification process is a combination of prequalification and 
ongoing monitoring � New suppliers are qualified using criteria including 
commercial risk, safety, performance, and sustainability � If noncompliance is 
identified for an existing supplier through ongoing monitoring, our  
procurement teams work with the supplier to rectify the issue �
COVID-19 Response
COVID-19 placed many stresses on our supply chain, especially with regards 
to PPE sourcing � A portion of Air Products staff were and continue to be 
essential workers required to be on site throughout the pandemic,  
requiring Company-provided PPE to stay safe � Furthermore, Air Products 
exceeded regulations in requiring the use of N-95 masks for personnel where 
distancing could not be maintained� Procurement teams met the challenge 
of keeping PPE supplied and in stock for the duration of 2020 through a  
combination of crisis preparedness and rapid response � 
Supplier Diversity
It is our policy and practice to provide maximum practical opportunities to 
diverse suppliers � In 2020, Air Products spent hundreds of millions of dollars  
in the U �S� with diverse suppliers, including small, socially, and economically 
disadvantaged, and other minority-owned and women-owned U �S�  
businesses that can provide competitive sources of materials and services � 
We offer advice and guidance to assist minority business firms in building 
relationships and becoming successful suppliers to us �Human Rights and Conflict 
Minerals
We complete annual human rights 
assessments for our operations and 
supply chains � From a supply chain 
perspective, we examined human 
rights risks relative to procurement 
spend and supplier location using 
country-specific risk information 
from third parties � Most of our  
suppliers are in heavy industries 
that are not as susceptible to human 
rights violations as other industries � 
No significant risks were identified 
through our assessment, and we are 
not aware of any allegations of  
violations of human rights in our 
supply chain in 2020 �
In addition, Air Products specifically 
evaluates our supply chain for the 
presence of conflict minerals � The 
Conflict Minerals Rule under the 
Dodd Frank Act requires companies 
to perform and disclose due diligence 
on the source of minerals within its 
supply chain including tantalum, tin, 
gold, and tungsten � The purpose of 
this regulation is to ensure that the 
purchase of those materials does 
not support armed conflict and the 
associated emergency humanitarian 
crisis in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo � 
To address the issue of conflict  
minerals, Air Products includes  
conflict minerals clauses in our 
standard contractual terms and 
conditions � We also comply with the 
Dodd Frank Act through the annual 
disclosure of our Conflict Minerals 
Report �Supply Chain SustainabilityData & Index Communities Employees Climate Environment Customers Strategy Contents52
Air Products  |  2021 Sustainability ReportStakeholder Engagement
We work closely with our key stakeholders – customers, employees, investors, communities, suppliers, and  
government regulators – to understand and respond to their needs and collaborate for shared benefit � Meetings, 
presentations, and ongoing dialogue with stakeholders throughout the year provide many opportunities for  
collaboration on sustainability �
Stakeholder Assessment
Air Products has been conducting stakeholder assessments since it began reporting in accordance with GRI  
guidelines � Stakeholder assessment have included:
•   Evaluating sustainability issues identified in various frameworks, standards, questionnaires, customer, and other  
    company reports and stakeholder questions
•   Interviewing and/or surveying key stakeholders to understand their sustainability concerns and priorities
•   Reviewing the results with our Sustainability Leadership Council to confirm  the priorities and further shape our   
    sustainability efforts
Topics for stakeholder assessments were taken from many sources, including SASB, TCFD, and CDP (see next page)�
Stakeholders reflected on these concerns and provided their feedback on the importance and potential impacts of 
the issues � The concerns rated by the stakeholders with the highest level of importance and impact are included in 
our Sustainability Priorities and frame our sustainability reporting �
The priorities for this Report have been updated slightly (see below) and confirmed by our Sustainability Leadership 
Council:
•  Safety has been expanded to Safety and Health and moved up in stakeholder importance, aligned with additional 
needs from COVID-19 �
•  Diversity has been expanded to Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging and moved up in stakeholder importance, 
aligned with our new diversity goals and efforts to be more inclusive and encourage dialogue about racism �
