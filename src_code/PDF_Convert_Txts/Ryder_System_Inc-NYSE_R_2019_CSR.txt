2019/2020 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
IMPACT FOR GOODNOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:  Certain statements and information included in this report are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning 
of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include our sustainability goals, commitments and 
programs; our business outlook, plans, priorities, initiatives and objectives; our assumptions and expectations; and the scope and impact of our risks and opportunities. 
These forward-looking statements are based on our current goals, plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which could cause 
actual results to differ materially from historical experience or from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although we believe there is 
a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. Forward-looking statements involve projections, and assumptions 
about our business outlook. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be evaluated with consideration given to the many risks and uncertainties that could 
cause actual results and events to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including those risks set forth in our periodic filings with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risks on 
our business. Accordingly, all such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any 
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.TABLE OF CONTENTS
