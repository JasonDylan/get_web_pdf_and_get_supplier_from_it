CORPORATE SOCIAL  
RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
At Comcast and NBCUniversal, we believe in the power and 
possibilities of media and technology. It’s more than what we do,  
it’s who we are. We’re a company of about 136,000 employees 
committed to leveraging our global assets in ways that go beyond 
creating value for our customers and shareholders to connecting and 
strengthening communities. As a company uniquely positioned to 
inform, empower, and inspire, we embrace the opportunity to create 
conversation and mobilize action to address some of the nation’s 
most critical issues. At Comcast and NBCUniversal, it’s not just about moving our business forward, it’s about moving people forward.  4
|  2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT  ABOUT COMCAST AND THIS REPORT
A MESSAGE FROM BRIAN L. ROBERTS
Since its founding, Comcast Corporation 
has been focused on shaping the future 
by driving innovation through technology 
and our smart people. That has never 
been more true than today.
I am happy to share that 2013, our 
company’s 50th anniversary, was a 
year of momentum for Comcast and 
NBCUniversal. Through our combined 
company, we brought our customers, 
shareholders, and employees the benefits 
of scale from our industry-leading 
products to our operating efficiencies.
As we continued on our path to creating 
a world-class technology and media 
company, we also leveraged the reach 
of our businesses to enhance the 
investments we make in our communities. 
As much as ever, we are committed to 
finding new, improved ways to use our 
expertise to responsibly drive our business 
forward, and set a positive example for 
our industry.
From our start in 1963 in Tupelo, 
Mississippi, giving back to our 
communities has been a part of our 
company’s DNA. In 2013, Comcast and 
NBCUniversal contributed a combined 
$415 million in cash and in-kind services 
to charitable organizations nationwide. 
We provided this support to aid people 
in need by strategically partnering with 
national nonprofits with the most reach 
locally, including Boys & Girls Clubs of 
America, United Way, and Big Brothers 
Big Sisters of America. 
As both technology and societal 
challenges evolve, we are committed to 
using our resources to raise awareness of 
and address the most pressing issues of 
the day. In 2013, we took additional steps 
to help close the digital divide by further 
expanding our Internet Essentials program, 
making broadband technology more affordable for more low-income Americans. 
Our goal is to remove educational and 
economic barriers so that success is 
within reach for everyone.
Comcast and NBCUniversal also used 
our digital and broadcast platforms to 
inform the general public about important 
matters, from tackling childhood obesity 
through NBC’s The Biggest Loser, to 
providing $45 million in public service 
announcement (PSA) airtime to help 
parents select appropriate children’s programming, to collecting online 
interviews commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of the March on Washington.
Of course, the linchpin of our company’s 
community investment efforts is the talent and commitment of our employees. Last 
year during Comcast Cares Day, our 
company’s annual day of service, we celebrated milestones in mobilizing our 
employees to make positive change in our 
communities. I am proud that since the 
first Comcast Cares Day in 2001, more 
than 500,000 volunteers have contributed 
3 million hours of service. 
While every year comes with its own 
challenges and opportunities, we 
believe our company’s ongoing growth 
and strategic investments will position 
us to continue to make a difference in 
our communities, and inspire others to 
do the same. We are humbled by the 
amazing things we accomplished in our company’s first 50 years, and we’re even 
more excited about what’s ahead.
Brian L. Roberts  
Chairman and CEO
“As much as ever, we 
are committed to

|  2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT  ABOUT COMCAST AND THIS REPORTQ: WHAT CORE PRINCIPLES OR 
BELIEFS SHAPE THE COMPANY’S 
FOCUS ON CORPORATE SOCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY AT THE  
HIGHEST LEVEL?
DAVID: When Ralph Roberts founded 
Comcast more than 50 years ago, he 
nurtured a family atmosphere among 
employees and encouraged the local 
cable systems to help people in need 
in their communities. As our company 
evolved from a tiny cable system into a world-class media company, that 
commitment — to caring, kindness, 
and ethical concerns — grew with it. 
Comcast is a company with a heart and 
soul, a company that cares about the 
communities it serves, and about our customers and their daily lives.
We make an enormous impact when 
we work side by side with nonprofit, 
civic, and government leaders in 
the thousands of communities we 
serve. When we strengthen these 
communities, we strengthen our 
business and our brand.
Q: HOW DO COMCAST AND 
NBCUNIVERSAL USE THEIR COMBINED 
BUSINESS STRENGTHS TO ADDRESS 
PRESSING SOCIAL CHALLENGES AND HELP MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE 
IN COMMUNITIES?
DAVID:  In ways no one else can, Comcast 
and NBCUniversal leverage our digital and 
broadcast platforms to direct attention 
to society’s most pressing causes and 
issues — and help foster conversation in 
search of answers. We do this by donating 
tens of millions of dollars in PSA airtime 
every year to nonprofit, advocacy, and government organizations. We respond to calls to action, such as helping veterans 
returning to civilian life find meaningful 
employment — including by hiring 2,000 
veterans ourselves since 2012.
From health services and expos 
provided by our NBCUniversal owned-
and-operated stations and Telemundo 
stations to the annual Flyers Wives 
Carnival fundraising event organized 
by Comcast-Spectacor Charities, all of 
our businesses actively mobilize to help address society’s challenges. That’s part of our DNA as a company.
Q: HOW HAS THE COMPANY’S 
COMMITMENT TO ACTING  
RESPONSIBLY EVOLVED?
DAVID: In the three years since initially 
acquiring NBCUniversal, we’ve taken 
significant steps toward becoming the 
most successful model of diversity and 
inclusion in the communications and 
entertainment industry. We continue 
to build a more diverse, inclusive, and 
engaged workforce with initiatives 
to develop and promote diverse 
candidates. We are steadily increasing 
our total hours of diverse programming available On Demand and online, and 
increasing diversity on air and behind 
the camera. In 2013, we launched our two newest diverse networks, REVOLT 
and El Rey. We are spending more with diverse suppliers than ever before. We are making communities stronger by 
expanding digital literacy, promoting 
community service, and developing 
tomorrow’s leaders. We know we have 
more to do — and we are committed 
to doing more every day — but we are 
proud of the progress we’ve made so 
far. That progress has built a strong foundation for the future.“We make an enormous 
impact when we work 
side by side with leaders 
in the thousands of 
communities we serve.”
—David L  . Cohen,  
Executive Vice President  
and Chief Diversity Officer
Q: WHERE HAS THE COMPANY 
ACHIEVED ITS GREATEST  
COMMUNITY IMPACT? 
DAVID: We believe closing the digital 
divide is the civil rights battle of the 21st 
century. As a technology and media 
company, we know the Internet has the 
power to transform lives, strengthen 
communities, and inspire a new generation of leaders. Through Internet 
Essentials, the nation’s largest and 
most comprehensive Internet adoption 
program, we have connected more 
than 1.2 million Americans to the power 
of the Internet at home. With our Time 
Warner Cable transaction, we see a 
tremendous opportunity to bring the 
benefits of Internet Essentials to millions 
of additional families.DAVID L. COHEN

|  2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT  Every other Thursday afternoon, Michael Mascaro sets aside 
his regular Comcast duties so that he and Aavon, a New Britain, 
Connecticut, fifth grader, can build model roller coasters, do 
arts and crafts, and connect with each other.
The two are a part of Beyond School 
Walls, our innovative workplace-
based mentorship program. Created 
in partnership with Big Brothers Big 
Sisters (BBBS) of America, Beyond 
School Walls matches at-risk youth 
with Comcast employees as part of 
our mission to strengthen individuals and communities through one-on-  
one mentoring.
Since the program’s 2008 launch, we 
have expanded Beyond School Walls 
to include 325 Comcast “Bigs” who 
volunteer their time as mentors to When Michael learned that his office was 
participating, he jumped at the chance to 
offer a child the same kind of guidance 
and support he received from his lifelong 
BBBS mentor, Tim.
“Tim’s subtle nudges helped guide me in 
the right direction,” says Michael. “Having 
that same opportunity to positively 
influence Aavon is deeply satisfying.”
Most of the youth who participate in our 
Beyond School Walls program achieve 
better grades and are less likely to drop 
out of high school as a result. And while 
Michael and Aavon spend a lot of their 
time playing — “He loves Connect Four, 
and he beats me regularly,” says  
Michael — the program’s workplace-
based setting also gets Aavon thinking 
about potential career opportunities. “By 
bringing Aavon to the office, I’m able to 
show him how I work with technology on 
an everyday basis,” he says. 
Just as Aavon gleans impactful life 
lessons during his time spent at the 
Comcast offices, Michael feels that he, 
too, is growing and evolving. “I’m just 
a better person all around for being a 
mentor,” he says. “I’d love to see more 
people and businesses get involved in programs like this — it’s so important to 
pay it forward.”

Walls program is deeply satisfying. 
“Littles” at 14 of our U.S. offices. In our 
efforts to guide participating Littles 
toward new and more positive directions, 
we have also contributed more than  
$50 million in cash and in-kind support 
to the national BBBS organization and 
its local chapters around the country. 
Michael knows firsthand what a positive 
impact mentoring can make in a child’s 
life. The Comcast advanced services 
director — who also serves on the 
board of directors of the Nutmeg BBBS 
chapter in Hartford, Connecticut — was 
once a Little in the program, too.ENRICH COMMUNITIES 12

This unique opportunity — launched 
in 2013 by Universal Orlando — takes 
place at Give Kids The World (GKTW) 
Village, a nonprofit, storybook-themed 
resort where children with life-
threatening illnesses and their families 
can spend an entire week relaxing 
and recharging in a fun and nurturing environment. We work closely with 
GKTW to give “wish families” access to 
our theme parks, and we invite Universal 
Orlando team members and guests to 
volunteer at GKTW Village.
“The volunteer vacation package gives our 
visitors an easy way to instill the values of 
service and generosity in their children,” says Diane O’Dell, Universal Orlando’s 
Vice President of Community Relations. 
“It also provides crucial support to our 
longtime partner GKTW.”Volunteers play a critical role at GKTW, 
filling about 1,400 shifts each week. 
They get involved in a wide range of 
activities — including serving meals 
in the Gingerbread House restaurant, 
landscaping the grounds, operating the 
GKTW train, and assisting wish families 
in games of putt-putt golf at Marc’s 
DinoPutt course. 
“When we heard about the opportunity, 
it was like it was custom-made for our 
family,” says Brian Lahmann, a recent 
volunteer at GKTW.
“I was really excited to help out the 
wish families,” agrees his son Nolan 
Lahmann, who served meals in the 
Gingerbread House. “I could see them 
smile, and I knew I was a part of helping 
them feel happy.” UNIVERSAL ORLANDO GUESTS VOLUNTEER TO HELP   
“WISH FAMILIES”
In the heart of Florida, something unexpected is taking place. 
Guests at Universal Orlando Resort’s two destination theme parks are spending part of their vacation as volunteers to help create unforgettable experiences for families in need.
The Lahmanns’ volunteer vacation was 
even more special because of their unique 
connection to GKTW. Nolan, now 11, 
celebrated his sixth birthday at the Village after ending chemotherapy treatments for 
leukemia. “Having been on the receiving 
end of the amazing generosity it takes to 
make the Village run, we felt honored to 
return as volunteers,” says Brian. 
Ice cream for breakfast, storybook 
character visits, weekly Halloween celebrations, and VIP access to 
Universal Studios and Universal Islands 
of Adventure are just a few of the experiences offered to wish families during their time at GKTW Village and  
our theme parks. 
“You see kids and families — who are 
facing these insurmountable challenges —  
skipping up and down the Avenue like 
they don’t have a care in the world,” notes 
Pamela Landwirth, President of Give Kids The World. “We literally could not 
provide this kind of experience without 
our volunteers and wonderful partners like 
NBCUniversal, who embrace our wish 
families with open arms.”
“Give Kids The World is truly a magical 
place,” says Brian. “The fact that it’s 
staffed largely by volunteers makes it even 
more so — it felt amazing to give back. 
Our entire family couldn’t stop smiling, 
even after we left.”

• Launching a new partnership with LIFT — a national nonprofit focused on lifting 
families out of poverty — that will expand digital literacy hubs at the organization’s 
resource centers in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.  
• Partnering with Boys & Girls Clubs of America — as the founding sponsor of 
My.Future — on Essentials, a new computer skills curriculum that provides 
access to digital literacy for club members across the country. Annually, more 
than 4,000 local clubs serve nearly 4 million young people through membership 
and community outreach.Here are some of the highlights of our work in 2013.
Comcast sponsors more than 50 high school

As part of our efforts to recognize 
outstanding high school seniors who 
excel both in their classrooms and 
their communities, we awarded nearly

 CREATE MEDIA THAT MATTERS 15
|  2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT  CREATE MEDIA THAT MATTERS
Upwards of 300,000 service 
members leave the military 
each year, but many find 
the transition to the civilian 
workforce unforgiving. Their 
specialized skills don’t always 
match up seamlessly with 
the types of background and 
expertise civilian employers  
say they’re seeking.
To help overcome this challenge, 
NBCUniversal spearheaded the launch 
of “Next Steps for Vets,” an online portal 
that provides employment information, 
small-business development tools, and 
educational resources tailored to military 
veterans.
Created in partnership with the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, “Next Steps 
for Vets” aims to empower veterans 
with clear, accurate information on how 
to map out new lives after hanging up their uniforms for the last time. Comcast 
and NBCUniversal are also partners in 
Hiring Our Heroes, a U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce Foundation initiative devoted 
to easing veterans back into  
the workforce.
“These tools identify and answer the 
real questions veterans are asking,” 
says former U.S. Marine Corps officer 
Andy Blenkle, who spearheaded the 
development of the site’s Resume Engine and GI Bill calculator as executive director 
of iostudio — a creative agency that employs a large number of former military 
members. “Service members completely 
immerse themselves in military culture 
for years,” Andy continues. “When the 
time comes to leave the service, many 
suddenly realize they have no idea what to 
do next.”
Andy says iostudio jumped at the 
opportunity to work with NBCUniversal, 
whose platform brings instant credibility to veterans’ causes. “When a brand 
like NBCUniversal lends its support to 
veterans and employers alike, it influences 
other corporations’ attitudes and shows 
just how valuable veterans are to the 
workforce,” he says. 
The Resume Engine is one of the site’s 
most powerful tools, as it helps veterans 
translate their military experience into 
marketable skills in demand among 
civilian employers.

flight deck of an aircraft carrier has vital 
skills and responsibilities, but how does 
he describe his experiences — in a 
way that is understood and accepted 
by interviewers and applicant tracking 
systems — for civilian jobs requiring the same skills?” asks Andy. “The Resume 
Engine is a military skills translator 
that explains how a veteran’s military 
experience can be a valuable asset to 
businesses while also taking into account 
how employers screen resumes.” 
The site’s GI Bill calculator, meanwhile, 
helps veterans evaluate all the educational 
benefits for which they’re eligible. “The 
government has added a number of 
valuable benefits to the traditional  
GI Bill, including a post-9/11 GI Bill,” Andy 
explains. “The GI Bill tool makes it easy 
by answering the question, ‘What am I eligible for?’ We then send them to the appropriate website with downloadable 
forms.”
Other “Next Steps for Vets” tools include  
a 12-step guide to starting a small 
business, a searchable job-fair map with 
hundreds of locations around the country, 
and access to job-search resources and 
best practices. 
“The portal delivers information in such 
an intuitive, simple way,” says Andy. 
“NBCUniversal has done a great job of 
promoting awareness of veterans’ issues, 
and then using its reach to make a real 
impact on people’s lives.”

“It’s our responsibility 
as a broadcast 
network to develop 
programming for 
everyone, whether 
they’re parents, kids, 
or older adults.”
—Bob Greenblatt, Chairman, 
NBC EntertainmentQ: WHY IS FAMILY-FRIENDLY 
PROGRAMMING IMPORTANT FOR NBC?  
BOB:  We feel it’s our responsibility 
as a broadcast network to develop 
programming for everyone, whether 
they’re parents, kids, or older adults. And it’s harder to pull off than it sounds. 
What kids and teenagers want to watch 
is usually very different from what adults want to watch. You need stories that are 
fun and positive, with some excitement in 
there as well.
Q: WHAT MADE 
THE SOUND OF  
MUSIC LIVE!  RESONATE WITH  
SUCH A BROAD AUDIENCE?   
BOB: The Sound of Music  story has been 
beloved for generations. In many ways 
it’s a very adult story, with the onset of 
Nazism and the religious themes. But the heart of the story is about kids growing up in a family, so kids identify, too. And 
the music binds everything together. It’s proved to be the Holy Grail of stories 
that work for many age groups. 
Q: HOW DID PEOPLE REACT   
TO THE BROADCAST?  
BOB: They loved it. I heard so many 
people say they hadn’t sat down as a 
family and watched a show like that in 
years. I heard from people all over the 
country, even people I didn’t know. 
Q: HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT DEVELOPING A NEW FAMILY-FRIENDLY SHOW?     
BOB: Think back to the great eight o’clock 
shows like The Cosby Show, when mom, 
dad, and the kids would gather like PROGRAMMING THAT BRINGS 
FAMILIES TOGETHER
NBCUniversal scored a huge hit in 2013 with The Sound of Music 
Live!, a one-night, three-hour event that delighted audiences of 
all ages and gave families a great reason to come together. Bob Greenblatt, Chairman of NBC Entertainment, talks about how The Sound of Music Live! contributed to NBCUniversal’s legacy of family-friendly programming, and why developing new family-oriented shows continues to be a priority for the network.

—Janis Kearney, personal diarist to President Bill Clinton

statement.”
—Nolan Atkinson, recounting a conversation he had with baseball 
legend Jackie Robinson after the march
“Everywhere on Earth that I’ve been, the words of Martin 
Luther King’s dream are known and repeated. And 
people have taken that dream and given it their own 
content.”
—Andrew Young, former U  .S . Ambassador to the United NationsHIS DREAM, OUR STORIES
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his celebrated  
“I Have a Dream” speech at the August 1963 March on 
Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a major milestone of 
the civil rights movement.  
To commemorate the speech’s 50th anniversary, we produced “His Dream, 
Our Stories,” an online collection of interviews and a free companion 
e-book featuring deeply personal, videotaped accounts from more than 
100 civic leaders, elders, clergy, and activists commemorating the march 
and its legacy. Just as the movement is alive today, the project lives on to 
chronicle the lives and stories of those who fight for equality for all people.

don’t do that much anymore. So the first 
thing we do is ask how we can get back to 
that. That might mean making the show an event — like a live musical — or it might 
mean more reality shows like The Voice, 
which people of all ages love because it’s so fun and cheerful. Plus, families tend to 
watch The Voice together so they can cast 
live votes for their favorite artists.
Q: DO YOU HAVE ANY NEW  
FAMILY-FRIENDLY SHOWS ON   
TAP FOR NEXT YEAR?      
BOB: Family-friendly shows will always be 
part of our lineup. We’re planning another 
live musical, Peter Pan, on December 4, 
2014. And we’re always looking to develop 
more reality shows that appeal to a broad family audience. 
Q: MANY NBCUNIVERSAL SHOWS 
INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL OR SOCIALLY 
RELEVANT STORYLINES THAT ARE BENEFICIAL TO KIDS. HOW DO YOU 
DECIDE WHEN IT’S APPROPRIATE TO 
EXPLORE SUCH ISSUES?      
BOB:  We have a diverse group of people 
working here in all branches, and we 
encourage them to express their feelings, 
backgrounds, and life experiences in the 
programming. If something is personally meaningful to them, we know it will likely 
be meaningful to our viewers. We also 
rally around important issues, such as sustainability in connection with Earth 
Week, and talk with our writers about 
inserting environmental storylines or messages. A lot of these issues aren’t 
exclusive to families, but if a child 
learns something about diversity or the environment while watching NBC, we 
think that’s great.

“Today, the TV navigation paradigm for 
someone who’s blind is largely limited to 
the use of the channel up and channel 
down button to search for a program 
to watch. That’s really just one step 
removed from having to get up and turn 
the knob, like we did back in the ’70s,” 
says Tom Wlodkowski, Vice President of 
Accessibility at Comcast.
Tom leads a companywide effort to make 
our products and services more functional 
and enjoyable for people of all abilities. 
His team gathers extensive customer 
input to help shape the development, 
testing, and implementation of Comcast 
and NBCUniversal offerings. For example, 
developing the U.S. cable industry’s first 
talking TV interface was a major focus 
in 2013. Tom also oversees our efforts 
to provide more accessible customer 
support services and promote greater 
accessibility and inclusiveness within our company culture.
“Accessibility really means independence 
and inclusion,” says Tom, who is 
blind. “We measure our success by how 
effectively people with disabilities can 
interact with our products — such as 
UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE THEME PARKS 
We continually work to create a more inclusive entertainment 
experience for guests with disabilities at Universal Orlando Resort’s 
two destination theme parks – Universal Studios and Universal 
Islands of Adventure – and at Universal Studios Hollywood.

our rides and attractions, so guests of all abilities can enjoy a 
fully immersive experience,” says John Sprouls, Executive

watch full-length TV programs with closed 
captions on a mobile device, or the ability 
for customers with a physical disability to 
use their voice to navigate the program 
guide on their set-top cable box.” 
Tom and his team follow the principles 
of universal design, which recognize that 
technology solutions should allow users 
with varying abilities to interact with them 
in multiple ways. “We work to figure out 
what different modes are required and 
then integrate that directly into the  
design,” he says.
We take a variety of paths in our effort 
to provide more universally accessible 
experiences for our customers with 
disabilities. At the Comcast Accessibility 
Lab, a workshop and showcase for 
assistive technologies, our engineers and designers interact with new product 
capabilities like voice navigation and eye-gaze technology that address the 
varying needs of users with disabilities. 
Their attention to detail is helping us 
develop groundbreaking features such as 
our talking cable TV interface within the 
X1 Platform™ by XFINITY
®, which has the power to revolutionize the way people 
who are blind interact with television. 
To help our customers with disabilities get 
the most out of their Comcast experience, 
we created the Comcast Accessibility 
Center of Excellence. Specially trained 
representatives at the center quickly and 
efficiently assist customers with issues 
such as setting up closed captioning and 
video description, receiving their bill in 
Braille or large print, and fulfilling requests 
for large-button remotes.   
Working to ensure our web and mobile 
products are compatible with assistive 
technologies and exploring the addition of 
accessibility enhancements in our XFINITY 
Home automation service further support 
our commitment to enabling the “Smart

PROMOTE  DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
|  2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT  Q: WHY IS SUPPLIER DIVERSITY 
CRITICAL TO ADVANCING COMCAST  
AND NBCUNIVERSAL ’S OVERALL BUSINESS OBJECTIVES?
DAPHNE: We believe that diversity of 
thought and ideas helps to make us a 
better and stronger company. A diverse 
supply base brings that to us.
AJAMU: Maintaining a diverse supplier 
base helps us deliver innovative 
products and services that keep our 
customers excited.
Q: HOW ARE YOU HELPING YOUR 
DIVERSE BUSINESS PARTNERS IN RETURN?   
DAPHNE: The day-to-day job of our 
Supplier Diversity leaders is really to 
be advocates — helping our partners 
navigate our processes, raising their visibility, and even introducing them to 
our peers in the media and entertainment 
industry. Most of these businesses are simply looking for an opportunity to 
compete. The ability of ferroconcrete, an 
Asian American, female-owned brand and design firm, to say, “Hey, we created 
the TODAY logo!” opens more doors for 
them — not only inside Comcast and 
NBCUniversal but also across the entire 
industry.
Q: HOW DOES WORKING WITH 
DIVERSE SUPPLIERS IMPACT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE ECONOMY?  
DAPHNE: Creating economic growth 
opportunities in diverse communities is key. When we help create opportunities, 
particularly for small, minority-owned businesses, those same businesses are 
more likely to hire diverse individuals. This 
creates more jobs in our nation’s growing diverse communities, which in turn 
contributes to the overall economy.
Q: IN WHAT WAYS ARE YOU REACHING 
OUT TO THEM TO CREATE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES?     
AJAMU: Comcast participates at more 
than 80 events a year, from panel 
discussions to one-on-one matchmaking 
sessions between diverse suppliers and our different business groups. 
We’ll connect with vendors and have a 
conversation about what they do and how they can work with us. After the 
introduction, we’ll stay in touch. When 
opportunities come up, our team will gather a list of diverse suppliers that we 
believe might be a good fit and invite 
them to participate in an RFP .
Q: HOW DO THE DIVERSE VENDORS YOU CONNECT WITH ADD VALUE TO THE 
COMPANY’S OFFERINGS?       
AJAMU:  Our suppliers are literally an 
extension of Comcast and NBCUniversal. 
They help us enhance our products and services, but they also reflect our 
corporate culture so our customers can 
have one seamless experience. I’ve found many to be particularly client-centric and 
nimble – they can turn on a dime and 
provide customized experiences for us and our customers. DIVERSE SUPPLIERS FOSTER 
INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY 
As a media and technology leader, we rely on innovative people and 
a diversity of ideas to help fuel the success of our business. Ajamu Johnson, Executive Director of Supplier Diversity and Strategic Procurement for Comcast and NBCUniversal, and Daphne Harvey, Senior Vice President of Sourcing at NBCUniversal, describe how working with diverse suppliers produces stronger results across our company and helps strengthen our communities. 
“NBCUniversal treats us 
like partners, with a  
great deal of respect.  
We feel even more 
welcome because of our 
diversity. They want to work with companies that 
are trying to do things 
differently, who support  
a diverse workforce.”

DAPHNE: Diverse suppliers bring us 
innovation of thought — that next great 
way to tell a story or help us get to 
market quicker, better, faster. It’s exciting to have these businesses contributing to 
our entertainment supply chain, helping 
to keep our products fresh, new, and — more importantly — relevant to our ever-
changing customer base.    23

This one-on-one matchmaking event 
connects diverse suppliers with potential 
procurement opportunities at Comcast 
and other large cable providers.
NBCUniversal engaged in matchmaking 
sessions and provided coaching to 
Native American-owned businesses 
during the American Indian Chamber of 
Commerce of California’s 10th Annual

Q: WHAT ATTRACTS EMPLOYEES TO 
COMCAST AND NBCUNIVERSAL?

innovation. To help achieve that focus, 
we cross-pollinate talent between Comcast and NBCUniversal through 
several of our professional development 
programs to generate fresh ideas and expose people to different areas of the 
overall business. We also highlight the 
unified and distinct aspects through our Spirit of Comcast and NBCUniversal

Internet Essentials has made broadband access affordable for the Guinn family, including Latrivia 
Guinn (left), with her daughter Donique.Like most families across 
America, Latrivia Guinn’s 
family needed computer and 
Internet access to perform 
everyday tasks like doing 
homework and research, 
using social media, and 
paying bills. But it wasn’t 
an affordable option — 
until Latrivia learned 
about Internet Essentials, 
Comcast’s flagship broadband 
access initiative.
Created to help bridge the digital divide 
between families who have access 
to critical technology tools and those 
who don’t, Internet Essentials provides 
affordable high-speed Internet service 
to the Guinn family for less than $10 per 
month. Now Latrivia’s children can do 
homework, check email, surf the web, 
and enjoy educational games anytime 
they want. 
“It’s made a huge difference in our lives,” 
says Latrivia, who decided to return 
to school and relied on the web while 
putting herself through nursing school at 
nearby Jackson Community College in 
Jackson, Michigan. 
Available to U.S. families with at least 
one child eligible to participate in 
the National School Lunch Program, 
Internet Essentials has opened a new 
world of educational, employment,  
and social opportunities for more than 
1.2 million low-income Americans 
since its launch in 2011. Comcast 
offers Internet Essentials across our 
footprint, which includes more than 
30,000 schools, and we have partnered 
with more than 8,000 community and 
government organizations to expand 
the program and unlock the full 
potential of digital learning.BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE — ONE FAMILY

“Through our 
partnership with 
Comcast, these

Tony Dungy (right) is the national spokesperson for Comcast’s Internet Essentials initiative.John Willis, Executive Director of the 
MLK Center, says Latrivia’s story is 
typical of many low-income families 
in the Jackson community and 
beyond who are ready and willing to 
learn digital literacy skills, but lack 
the necessary resources and support. 
With Internet Essentials, that’s no 
longer the case.
“About 90 percent of the families in 
our community are below the median 
income for our city,” says John. 
“Through our partnership with Comcast, 
these families now have the opportunity 
to apply for jobs, develop Internet and 
computer skills, use iPads ®, and even 
learn how to use video production tools. 
Our work together is opening people’s 
eyes to what’s possible.” 
The Guinn family’s experience 
has been particularly inspiring to 
John. “I watched Latrivia grow from 
a guarded, shy young lady who had 
not done much computer work to a 
proud nursing school graduate,” he 
says. “And her kids are doing great in school. It’s been amazing to see such 
wonderful growth.” 
Latrivia is equally enthusiastic. “My 
kids love it, and I use the Internet for 
almost everything — I’ve been able 
to look for a new job, pay most of my 
bills, do couponing, shop online, and 
so much more. Now, I’d feel like a fish 
out of water without it.”

he sees strong alignment between our program’s goals and those of the 
nonprofit Dungy Family Foundation he runs with his wife, Lauren. Based in Tampa, Florida, the Foundation believes in strengthening, sustaining, and

LIKE COMCAST HELP KIDS DEVELOP 
HEALTHY MEDIA HABITS?
DR. RICH: Like any for-profit company, 
Comcast has a responsibility to think 
beyond its bottom line and account for 
the physical, mental, and social health 
of its consumers. Comcast has done 
an excellent job, in my experience, of 
recognizing that media are powerful and 
approaching the conversation in a healthy 
way. They’re asking how we can enhance 
the positive effects of media and protect 
against potential harm.
Q: HOW CAN PARENTS HELP CHILDREN 
DEVELOP A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP 
WITH MEDIA?
DR. RICH: Parents and children need to 
recognize that media platforms are tools, 
and it’s up to individuals to use them in conscious and focused ways. Rather than 
talking about the Internet as an inherently 
dangerous place, we should be helping 
HELPING FAMILIES MAKE 
SMART MEDIA CHOICES
TEACHING CHILDREN DIGITAL AWARENESS 
As Comcast’s Senior Vice President of Operations Compliance, 
Susan Jin Davis plays a critical role in shaping Comcast’s strategy for 
online safety and digital citizenship. “In our expanded role, we serve as both the conduit to media content and the content itself,” says 
Susan, explaining why Comcast is committed to helping parents 
manage their children’s media consumption.
“We want to give parents the tools and support to help their kids make 
smart media choices — now and for the rest of their life,” she says.
Moving forward, Comcast’s priorities include:
• Transitioning the discussion from parental controls to media mastery
• Creating tools and products that are easy to useDr. Michael Rich has spent his career offering advice on how 
families can make smart media and technology choices. Commonly 
known as the “Mediatrician,” the onetime filmmaker and founder of 
the Center on Media and Child Health at Boston Children’s Hospital 
works with Comcast to provide guidance for our parental controls 
microsite, www.xfinity.com/parents. Here, he discusses Comcast’s 
approach to encouraging healthy media use for children.
• Building a platform that allows parents to control and monitor 
media access on several networks at once — including 
video, mobile, and data — along with helping parents carry 
over settings from one network to the next
Comcast offers a variety of tools to help parents engage with 
their children’s digital media lives, including videos and online 
columns, TV and movie locks, Common Sense Media ratings, 
Family Sense® social monitoring tools, and Norton™ Family 
parental control software.

letting them know that you respect them

that dialogue, you can talk about the 
content of the games. Playing with them 
and sharing your observations is much 
more effective than screaming from the 
next room, “I hate that game; turn it off.”
Q. HOW DOES YOUR PARTNERSHIP 
WITH COMCAST HELP SPREAD THE 
WORD ABOUT MEDIA AND   
CHILDREN’S HEALTH?
DR. RICH:  We’re able to model — for the 
first time, perhaps — a true partnership 
between industry and academia on how 
we can educate and empower parents 
and children to use these tools well. 
And from a purely practical standpoint, 
Comcast has great distribution. The more 
we can integrate this message with all of 
Comcast and NBCUniversal’s products as 
they go out, the more it becomes part of the fabric of how people use media.

children learn to master these tools — and 
that means being involved in your kids’ 
digital lives. It’s like learning to drive a car. 
You don’t teach by saying, “Don’t hit that 
tree.” You say, “Let’s drive the car,” and in 
the process you learn safe driving habits. 
It’s the same thing for learning to navigate 
the digital world. 
Q: YOU’VE CREATED A NUMBER OF 
DIGITAL PARENTING VIDEOS FOR 
THE XFINITY WEBSITE, AMONG 
OTHER ACTIVITIES. WHAT ARE SOME 
PRACTICAL TIPS THAT PARENTS CAN 
FIND ON THE XFINITY WEBSITE?
DR. RICH:  One suggestion is to let 
kids teach their parents how to use 
technology. Kids are early adopters — 
they’re flexible and resilient thinkers. 
What they don’t have are fully developed 
executive brain functions, particularly 
in areas like impulse control and 
future thinking. So while you might get

When Comcast announced the 
acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2010, we also announced a number of voluntary public-interest benefits and commitments that will allow us to better serve the entertainment, communications, and information needs of American consumers. The Department of Justice and the FCC also placed certain conditions on the NBCUniversal transaction, including competitive, public-interest, and diversity provisions that align with many of our voluntary commitments.
In February 2014, we filed our third 
annual report detailing our progress over

Telemundo Philadelphia (WWSI), one of two stations added to the Telemundo Station 
Group in 2013, began airing two Spanish-
language weeknight newscasts on January 13, 2014 — the station’s first-ever local 
news programs. In support of the launch, 
the station recruited 15 Spanish-speaking journalists and other professionals to fill 
the roles of reporter, producer, anchor, and 
photographer, as well as positions in sales, finance, and engineering.
During 2013, the NBC Owned Television 
Stations produced and aired approximately 
2,500 hours of regularly scheduled local 
news programming over and above the amount aired in the year preceding the 
closing of the transaction, surpassing the 
requirement to add 1,000 hours of new local news programming by approximately 
1,500 hours. At the Telemundo Station 
Group, the stations aired approximately 2,300 hours of regularly scheduled local 
news programming over and above the 
amount aired in the year preceding the closing of the transaction, not including the 
news from the recently acquired stations in 
Philadelphia and McAllen, Texas. This total exceeds the requirement in this condition 
by approximately 1,300 hours.

EXPANDING OUR VOD AND  
ONLINE PROGRAMMING
We have surpassed our original 
commitment to make more content 
available via video on demand (VOD) 
and online. During 2013, the total number of VOD choices available 
at no additional charge to Comcast 
customers averaged 38,991 per month — nearly doubling the 20,000 
choices needed to satisfy our year-three 
commitment. This includes more than 9,000 VOD broadcast content choices, 
averaging 778 per month — the only 
VOD service that offers programming from all four major broadcast networks 
as soon as the day after it airs.
PARTNERSHIPS WITH NONPROFIT 
NEWS ORGANIZATIONS
We continue to maintain nonprofit news 
organization partnerships between 
the Voices of San Diego and NBC7 
San Diego; ProPublica and NBC4 New York; The Chicago Reporter and 
NBC5 Chicago; WHYY and NBC10 
Philadelphia; and KPCC Southern California Public Radio and NBC4 
Southern California. In addition, NBC6 
South Florida continues its partnership with the nonprofit Florida Center for 
Investigative Reporting to enhance the 
station’s local investigative reporting.
EMPOWERING PARENTS
We are expanding our efforts to empower parents in making informed 
programming choices for their children. 
Our programmers continue to use ratings icons that are 50% larger 
than they were prior to the Comcast 
acquisition and use high-contrast color combinations. All ratings icons, 
including post-commercial break 
events, are displayed on-screen for  15 seconds.We also added on-screen parental ratings icons to NBCUniversal-produced or 
-licensed TV programming provided to  
14 NBCUniversal websites, plus  
hulu.com and xfinitytv.com.
In 2013, our qualifying networks (those 
with an above-average concentration of 
adult viewers between ages 25 and 54 
who have children in their household)  
aired PSAs with a value of more than  
$61 million on the topics of digital literacy, parental controls, nutritional guidelines, and childhood obesity. This amount 
includes the PSAs on childhood obesity 
that aired at least once during each hour of NBC’s core educational and instructional 
programming, plus an average of two 
times a day on Sprout. Our investment exceeded the $15 million annual spend 
required by the FCC conditions by more 
than $46 million, for a cumulative three-year sum of $102 million — $57 million 
more than required.  
Common Sense Media (CSM) content — 
including thousands of review videos, tip 
videos, ratings, and recommendations — is integrated into Comcast’s VOD service  
and promoted on xfinitytv.com.  Comcast 
also expanded its partnership with CSM to 
integrate the organization’s TV and movie ratings into the “Kids” section of  xfinitytv.com.  As Comcast Chairman and CEO 
Brian Roberts demonstrated on stage at The Cable Show 2013, CSM ratings are fully integrated into Comcast’s next-
generation X2 user interface, providing 
clear, practical information for parents at the point of decision. This platform will 
allow XFINITY TV customers to filter kids 
content by age, making it even easier for 
parents to discover movies and television 
shows for their families. It also will provide 
CSM’s ratings across platforms, so parents will have access to the information 
when watching video on a TV, PC, tablet, 
or smartphone.
CHILDREN’S PROGRAMMING
Our VOD programming choices geared toward children now average 6,871 
per month. This represents 4,093 more 
children’s VOD choices than the 2,778 average monthly choices available during 
the year preceding the closing of the 
transaction. Comcast also launched its XFINITY TV “Summer of Kids” event to 
spotlight its substantial library of family-
friendly VOD content, along with more than 1,000 downloadable children’s 
assets. In addition, Comcast provides 
authenticated subscribers with access to

BROADCAST TELEVISION 
INVESTMENTS
Since 2011, Comcast has invested billions 
of dollars in programming for the NBC 
Television Network and has supported 
the necessary infusion of creative energy and organizational support to reclaim its 
leadership among the broadcast networks.  
As a result of these investments, NBC is winning the 2013–14 primetime season 
in key demographics for the first time in a 
decade. NBC’s TODAY continues to gain momentum and deliver substantial ratings 
growth, and NBC Nightly News with 
Brian Williams is America’s most-watched network evening newscast. 
The Telemundo network ranked as 
the fastest-growing Spanish-language 
network year over year in primetime 
among total viewers and adults between ages 18 and 49, and Telemundo Studios, 
the biggest producer of Spanish-language 
original content in the country, continues to expand a production operation that 
now delivers more than 750 hours of 
telenovela programming a year through its Miami studios.
VENTURE CAPITAL
Comcast has delivered on our commitment to establish a $20 million 
venture capital fund to expand 
opportunities for businesses with minority ownership in new media  
content and applications. Comcast 
Ventures’ Catalyst Fund (formerly the Opportunity Fund) continues to offer 
impactful opportunities for minority 
entrepreneurs. In 2013, Comcast Ventures renewed its partnership with 
DreamIt Ventures, a leading technology 
accelerator program, to fund the minority entrepreneur accelerator program 
DreamIt Access. Participating start-
up companies received seed funding and had access to DreamIt Ventures’ 
benefits and services, including business 
talent, legal and accounting services, mentoring, office space, guidance 
from leading business visionaries, 
and contacts to reach the next level of development. Through the DreamIt 
Access partnership, DreamIt and 
Comcast have successfully sponsored 20 minority-led start-ups since 2011, the 
vast majority of which are still operating. 
Most of these companies are focused on web and mobile technologies. The 
Catalyst Fund is making follow-on 
investments in some of the DreamIt Access companies, as well as initial 
investments in other early-stage 
ventures led by diverse entrepreneurs with innovative technology ideas and 
solutions that fit within the sectors of 
Consumer, Enterprise, and Mobile.
BROADBAND NETWORK 
EXPANSION
In 2013, Comcast expanded its existing 
broadband network by 2,381 miles, 
surpassing the annual 1,500-mile 
requirement by 881 miles and bringing the combined three-year total to 6,289 
miles — 141% of the 4,500-mile build-
out required by the FCC conditions. In addition, we extended our broadband 
network to 296,744 additional homes 
in 2013, bringing the cumulative total to 718,511 and far surpassing our

and have secured the 2015, 2018, and 
2021 Super Bowl games. The networks of NBCUniversal will continue to be 
the home of the best NHL games, and 
Telemundo will be the place to turn to for World Cup and FIFA events from 
2015 through 2022.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
We have gone above and beyond our 
commitments to enhance diversity in 
various areas. We are striving to develop 
the premier model of diversity and inclusion in the communications and 
entertainment industries.

“We knew there was an opportunity to 
do something exciting with this project,” 
says Andrew Stumpf, Director of Facilities, 
Development, and Construction. “And I 
think what we’ve done really lives up to 
that expectation.”
The Brokaw News Center — home 
to the Los Angeles bureaus of NBC 
News and Telemundo, as well as the 
locally owned-and-operated KNBC4 
and KVEA stations — is a testament 
to Comcast and NBCUniversal’s 
dedication to technological innovation and environmental stewardship. Features 
like LED studio lighting, fiber-optic 
wiring, advanced cooling systems, and 
efficient power management controls 
give the facility an advanced technology 
infrastructure that helps conserve energy 
throughout the Brokaw News Center.
“The team took a film processing plant and 
turned it into a state-of-the-art news center,” 
says Matthew Braatz, Senior Vice President A BLUEPRINT FOR INNOVATION 
AND STEWARDSHIP 
With the design of NBCUniversal’s new state-of-the-art Brokaw 
News Center, we wanted to do more than simply build a new headquarters for our West Coast broadcast operations. We wanted to make a statement. To do so, we reimagined — and completely rebuilt — an aging office complex in Universal City into a future-focused, more environmentally sustainable facility. 
of Broadcast Operations. “It’s an amazing 
facility that’s really built for the future.”
Doing so took the familiar phrase “reduce, 
reuse, recycle” to a new level. For 
example, 96% of the 2,760 total tons of 
debris generated during the demolition 
phase was recycled or reused. 
Andrew and his team also connected the 
mechanical and electrical systems —  
along with intelligent air conditioning and equipment layouts that allow for 
more controlled airflow — to enable two 
buildings to effectively act as one. 
“With everything from the lighting load to 
the cooling systems, we have controls in 
place to get the most benefit out of our 
energy use while also having the most 
flexibility,” he says.
Studio sets that would typically rely on 
high-energy lamps now have highly 
efficient LED lighting. Highly concentrated “The infrastructure is 
very forward-
thinking. It allows us 
to adapt the facility 
for whatever 
technology changes 
may come.” 
—Matthew Braatz, Senior Vice 
President of Broadcast  
Operations, NBCUniversalequipment areas were designed after large 
data center “server farms” to maximize 
airflow and minimize cooling capacity.
“The infrastructure is very forward-thinking,” 
Matthew says. “It allows us to adapt the 
facility for whatever technology changes 
may come.” 
Operations personnel also have more 
control over energy usage and can 
transfer power when and where it’s 
needed. Even the trestles and shades 
adorning the exterior serve both aesthetic and conservation purposes. “We’re saving 
a significant amount of money and power over what a normal broadcast facility 
would require,” adds Matthew. 
In fact, the Brokaw News Center’s 
sustainability innovations will yield 
annual estimated savings of 800,000 
kWh of electricity, the equivalent of more 
than 700,000 pounds of carbon dioxide 
emissions, and more than $128,404 in energy costs. 
“To me, it really makes a statement,” 
Matthew says. “It shows how we as 
a company are investing in and feel 
strongly about the sustainable future of 
broadcasting.”Andrew Stumpf, Director of Facilities,

In late 2013, Dennis Mathew 
found insight in an unexpected 
place — his family’s Christmas 
lights. Often a source of faulty, 
tangled frustration during the 
holiday season, the strings 
of twinkling bulbs adorning 
his Philadelphia-area home 
suddenly had a different impact 
on Dennis. 
As Vice President of XFINITY Home 
Deployments for Comcast Cable, Dennis 
knew that XFINITY Home’s capabilities 
had evolved from home security into 
multi-faceted automation. But as he was 
beta-testing a new product application 
that will allow customers to monitor their 
energy usage, Dennis saw the platform’s 
value in a whole new way. 
“All of a sudden I was much more diligent, 
because I could see how much energy 
the lights were using just by looking at 
the XFINITY Home app on my phone,” 
Dennis says.
It’s exactly that sort of reaction that 
Dennis and his team aim to bring to 
XFINITY Home customers when they add 
new and enhanced features.
“We are well positioned to build on the 
platform and allow our customers to 
find more ways to reduce energy usage,” 
Dennis says. “We’re looking to innovate 
so we can help customers be more 
environmentally conscious while also accomplishing their other goals — such as saving money.”
That mission of innovation took an 
important step forward in 2013 as TURNING A HOUSE INTO A MORE 
SUSTAINABLE HOME
XFINITY Home joined forces with 
EcoFactor to introduce the EcoSaver™ 
solution — a feature that integrates 
with XFINITY Home thermostats to help 
heating and cooling systems run more 
efficiently and intuitively. 
“Comcast was at the top of our list of 
ideal partners,” says John Steinberg, 
Co-founder of EcoFactor. “The XFINITY 
Home team shared our vision for how 
energy management could simplify 
people’s lives and become a part of 
a larger, integrated home automation 
solution.”
A significant part of that shared vision 
is what John calls “savings without 
sacrifice,” a concept that aims to give 
customers maximum convenience. 
XFINITY Home customers can rely on 
the system to adjust to their preference, 
such as having automatic “home/away” 
thermostat settings, in order to better 
optimize energy and cost savings. 
“We focus on generating results in a 
way that let people focus on living their 
lives,” John says. “XFINITY Home with “XFINITY Home with 
EcoSaver delivers 
multiple benefits — 
comfort, convenience, 
leading-edge 
technology, cost 
savings, reduced 
energy use — that 
appeal to everyone.”

EcoSaver delivers multiple benefits —

Dennis and his team are continually 
working on home automation solutions 
for everything from door locks and 
garage door openers to appliance 
controls and HD-capable security cameras.  
“Our vision is for the home to get smarter 
and smarter,” he says. “We want your 
systems to understand where you are, 
what your preferences are, and how to 
react accordingly. You’re comfortable, 
you’re conserving energy, you’re
