Sustainability Management(SM) Framework 
SK Telecom has taken various measures aimed at enhancing value for customers, employees and
shareholders and building trust with business partners, governments and regional communities. TheEthics Management Group, which is responsible for incorporating sustainability into business practices,appoints ethics management agents in 55 departments throughout the company. It operates taskforces and working groups to boost synergies between related departments. Sustainability issues thathave significant implications to our business, such as joining the UN Global Compact, are subject toreview and resolution by the SK Telecom Board of Directors. We plan to set up senior-level channels
for closer inter-departmental cooperation to effectively respond to demands for greater accountabilityand changes in the operating environment.
Stakeholder Engagement
We conduct regular surveys to measure the satisfaction levels of participants and beneficiaries of
social contribution programs, in addition to our customers and employees. The surveys are used tomake continuous improvements. We plan to add a regular survey targeting business partners in 2008.
In preparation, we developed the survey index and carried out a preliminary assessment in 2007. Inaddition, the Social Contribution Advisory Group identifies local and international trends in corporatesocial responsibility and the needs of our communities. Comprised of related outside experts, thegroup was set up to ensure effective implementation of our social contribution activities. 
We devoted substantial time and effort to step up our external communication activities in 2007. We
took part in presentations and debates to gather stakeholders’ feedback on our sustainabilitymanagement and identify areas for improvement. A survey was also conducted targeting 210 opinionleaders and 500 persons of the general public to determine the prerequisites to becoming the world’smost admired company. In 2008, we plan to renew the company website and set up a new global-level
consultative body to gather stakeholders’ opinions on sustainability management on a regular basisand to more effectively incorporate their views in how we conduct our business. SK Telecom 2007  Sustainability Report

Materiality Assessment Process 
We identified a total of 232 issues upon reviewing various sources of information including internal
documents on company strategy, a study benchmarking global telecom operators, and media analysis.After categorizing the issues to determine their level of significance, we arrived at 35 issues for whichwe analyzed the social concerns and business impact. For social concerns, we used the results ofmedia analysis, global standards, reports from peer companies, and the results of a corporatereputation survey. For business impact, we performed an in-house evaluation for each issue based onstrategic correlation, financial impact, and impact on risk and reputation. 
Major Issues Derived from Materiality Assessment
The major issues are covered in the “Materiality Issues to Our Business and Society” section (pages
13~31) of the report. Issues deemed to have a relatively lower significance are detailed in the “OtherIssues and Performance Data” section (pages 34~39) along with the GRI performance indicators.

Digital Inclusion
In the case of CDMA/WCDMA, our network already covers 99% of the Korean population and 89% of
nationwide territory. We continue with efforts to extend network coverage to islands, mountainousregions and other areas with poor access. Moreover, we are carrying out projects that utilize ourtechnology and nationwide network to enhance the quality of life for residents of remote regionsthrough such services as “mobile hospitals” (vehicles or ships carrying medical equipment). SKTelecom participated in the mobile hospital project in Chungcheongnam-do province in 2007 inaddition to Busan.
Our services are being continuously upgraded to meet the specific needs of different population
groups. In 2007, we introduced a payment plan specially designed for senior citizens who mainly usetheir cell phones to receive incoming calls. We also offer a program called “Mobile Phone UsageEducation” for the elderly in conjunction with the Korea Association of Senior Welfare Centers. The
program was launched in September 2007 with classes at five senior welfare centers in the Seoulmetropolitan area and was expanded nationwide in November. University students who are members
of SK Telecom’s Sunny assisted the program.  
Our customers include about 40,000 people with hearing or speech disability. In March 2007, we
opened a video telephony center manned by agents who provide free consultation through sign
language when a registered hearing impaired user makes a video call. We also lowered flat rates by35% for text messaging, multimedia messaging and video call, services which are widely used bypeople with hearing or speech disability. A special payment plan for users with such disabilities was
introduced in August to alleviate their cost burden. SK Telecom introduced “SK Telecom IT
Competition” for physically and mentally challenged youth in 1999 to enhance computer skills amongthe youth with various disabilities. A total of 1,235 youngsters from across the nation took part in the2007 competition, and 350 who passed the regional qualifiers competed in the final held in June.

Despite the aggravated business environment caused by severe competition in the industry, SK
Telecom is investing steadily to develop products and services for future growth. We are engaged inefforts to commercialize Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA), 3Gmobile technology which is being developed in China. Related to this endeavor, we jointly set up anR&D center in Beijing with Datang Telecom of China in February 2007. In April of the same year, wesuccessfully completed a test of the world’s first international video conference based on TD-SCDMA.In particular, we set up the Human-Centered Innovation Team whose role is to analyze people’sbehavioral patterns by drawing on the discipline of anthropology in order to develop products andservices that satisfy consumer needs. 
Open Collaboration System 
SK Telecom will combine Web 2.0 spirit of openness, participation and sharing with win-win partnership
to strengthen the capabilities of our business partners and promote strategic cooperation. In 2007, wedrew up a strategy for open collaboration whereby venture businesses propose new ideas and SKTelecom studies the commercial viability of those ideas. The strategy covers ways to select, foster andevaluate business partners. We plan to launch an information system to efficiently oversee the relatedprocesses in the first half of 2008.
Open Idea+Festival 
We launched the Open Idea+Festival in 2007 to promote win-win cooperation through joint
commercialization of ideas from small- and mid-sized venture businesses. The festival was held in Aprilto uncover new ideas and business models from existing and potential business partners. The eventattracted 77 participants and a total of 42 ideas and business models were acknowledged. We arecurrently making a progress on joint commercialization for the Grand Prize winner and will continue withsuch endeavors in the future. 
Collaborative R&D Program
SK Telecom provides funding for joint research with outside research organizations and SME partners to
support R&D and commercialization of viable new businesses. Since 2004, we provided a total of KRW17.5 billion in a wide range of areas including satellite broadcasting and protecting intellectual propertyrights for contents. In particular, KRW 1.6 billion was channeled toward the development of mobileconditional access solution between 2005 and 2006. Work is currently underway to commercialize thesolution in China and Thailand. Meanwhile, some 50 business partners are involved in our overseasoperations in the US, Vietnam and China. In addition, we help business partners reinforce their R&Dthrough a variety of programs.

Wireless communications are enabling us to be connected everywhere, all of the time, while the growth of
Internet access over mobile phones opens up the opportunity to increase access to information and exchangeideas and opinions. With this increasing importance comes an opportunity for mobile companies to design newproducts, services and technologies that provide social, economic and environmental value. As SK Telecomgrows internationally in markets such as the US, Vietnam and China it will find itself in locations with their ownunique social, economic and environmental priorities. We would like to see SK Telecom explore where and howits operations and services can be used to advance education, healthcare and environmental goals in theselocations. Specifically, we hope that SK Telecom can explore how these sustainability priorities can best beintegrated into its core product, service and technology offerings and development processes. With growingattention to global resource scarcity, SK Telecom can be a leader in leveraging technology for a moresustainable world. Achieving this would place SK Telecom among the leaders in CSR.
Expert CommentaryBuilding Trust in Global Markets
SK Telecom has built up a strong presence in overseas markets such as Vietnam, the US and China
based on strategies tailored to the needs of the respective regions. Community involvement programsform an integral part of our global operations. We carry out various social contribution activities prior tolaunching our local business. That has contributed to gaining trust from the local communities, which isvital for success. 
Vietnam
In conjunction with the Smile for Children, SK Telecom has been supporting free surgeries for Vietnamese
children with facial deformities since 1996. A total of 2,495 children have been benefitted by the surgeriesby the end of December 2007. In 2006, we introduced the Thu-Vien SK Telecom project jointly with Global
Civic Sharing to help develop the country’s educational infrastructure. Another milestone was the opening
of the SKT-SSU IT Training Center in Ho Chi Minh in December 2007 to foster IT professionals.
Outstanding trainees from the center will be given the opportunity to study and work in Korea. 
China
SK Telecom is also helping to improve the educational environment in China. In August 2007, we
opened the Yanbian IT Center which provides IT training to teens and university students in Yanbian,
an area where computer and Internet education is underdeveloped. In Urumqi, we set up the HopeElementary School which allows 240 children to continue their education. In January 2008, the SK
Fund was created under an agreement between China and SK. The fund supports a program that
provides training and business start-up assistance for university students as well as a programdesigned to promote science and creativity among middle/high school students. 
16SKT¿ „ﬁ_SR_ˆ `   2008.6.9 6:10 PM  ˘ ` 16    SK Telecom is aiming to emerge as a leading telecommunication service provider in
Korea and beyond. To this end, we are committed to improving service quality andsafety. In July 2006, we voluntarily stopped offering of adult contents. In 2007, wepioneered diverse privacy and security initiatives in Korea designed to protectcustomer information and youth customers and prevent spam messages. Our aim in2008 is to identify risks such as customer information leaks, wireless Internet billingerrors, and spam messages that can potentially hurt our strong legacy of customertrust. 
Voice of Customers
SK Telecom operates the VOC (Voice of Customers) management system to continuously monitor
customers’ concerns and grievances and to make improvements as necessary. As part of our effortsfor complaint prevention, we incorporate customers’ opinions in drawing up our marketing policy, billingand pricing system, and other facets of operations. We also set up the necessary infrastructure toacquire CCMS (Customer Complaints Management System) certification which specifies the systemsneeded for the prevention of and follow-up to customer complaints. We became the first
telecommunications company to gain CCMS certification from the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) inJanuary 2008. 
We enhanced the VOC process in 2007 by introducing a new system whereby a customer who makes
a repeat call within four days is connected to the same service agent. We also launched the Call Backservice. In August, we opened the Customer Complaint Department in the Customer CounselingCenter which serves as a channel for receiving customer opinions and addressing complaints.Customer service agents receive training at Rainbow Academy to obtain the skills required to satisfydiverse customer needs. 
The number of complaints filed against SK Telecom with external organizations such as the Korea
Communications Commission, Korea Consumer Agency and Consumer Union of Korea dropped 32%year-on-year to 7,223 in 2007. In addition, the company continued to rank first in the mobile telecomcategory in the three major customer satisfaction surveys conducted in Korea.

SK Telecom makes every effort so that our customers may use our services with peace of mind. We
clearly inform customers of our pricing system, use of personal information, and other important factsthat customers need to know. To enhance billing accuracy, we review the billing details of allcustomers. When we detect an excessive jump in a customer’s monthly charge, we make a separatecheck to verify the figures. Since early 2007 we have utilized Product Life-cycle Management (PLM) tocheck the quality and possibility of billing errors before the launch of any new and promotionalproducts. 
We have taken various steps to respond to demands to ease the cost burden of telecom services. We
have been offering the caller identification (CID) service for free from January 2006 and we lowered
rates on text messaging in January 2008. In 2007, we introduced a plan under which discounted rates
are applied to calls made between SK Telecom service subscribers. This plan has been hugelypopular, attracting more than 2 million customers in just five months. We will expand this discount
program between our subscribers and offer a family discount scheme in 2008 to help lower household
telecom expenditures.
In addition, we offer the Silver Plan for senior citizens, the i-Kids Plan for children aged 12 years or
under, and a pricing plan to meet the needs of the disabled to alleviate the burden of customers whocannot easily use the mobile telecom services for economic reason. 
Responsible Marketing 
During the sales process, we pursue effective communication with customers to convey accurate
product information. Through periodic analysis of marketing data and monthly onsite monitoring, weinspect whether our marketing policies are being properly implemented and take measures to addressany oversights. Through rigorous monitoring and supervision, we are working to prevent inappropriateand illegal marketing activities at our branches, dealers and other customer outlets.

Mobile telecom has become an essential part of life in Korea. However, its rapid growth has given rise to
various consumer complaints. First, telecom expenditures are higher in Korea than in any other countrybecause the local market is not fully competitive. Another cause for criticism against mobile telecom operators isthe failure to prevent problems related to youth telecom spending by not taking into account that their servicesare used by a wide range of people. Recently, the premature launch of WCDMA without sufficient technologicalbacking has raised questions about possible loss for consumers. It is encouraging that SK Telecom is showinghigh levels of customer satisfaction after improvements to how it responds to consumer complaints. Butconsidering that SK Telecom is a company that serves half the population, it will face even greater demandsfrom consumers. The ability to respond appropriately to such demands will enhance SK Telecom’scompetitiveness.
Expert CommentaryService Quality and Reliability  
Customers are giving high marks to the quality of our basic services including call quality, as
demonstrated by our top ranking in major customer satisfaction surveys such as National CustomerSatisfaction Index, Korean Customer Satisfaction Index and Korea Standards on Service QualityIndex. On the back of our world-class CDMA service featuring over a decade of operational know-how,we are now striving to secure the same level of quality service for WCDMA. In 2007, we launched ayear-long campaign to improve quality of our core services including wireless Internet by surveying andimproving quality within 220,000 major buildings and 200,000 underground repeaters. 
We are also working to offer greater service reliability to our mobile phone users by curbing any health
risks that may be associated with the use of mobile phones, both physical and mental. In regards toelectromagnetic radiation, we only support devices that have met the Radio Research Laboratory’sICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) standard. 
Customer Privacy Protection 
Fully complying with the Act on Promotion of Utilization of Information and Communication Network
and Data Protection, we notify our customers of what and how we collect personal information andrequest their approval on our privacy policies released via subscription applications or on our website.In April 2007, we set up Korea’s first Security Operation Center to better safeguard customerinformation. Since the end of 2007, all subscription applications are scanned and transmitted to the
customer database managed by the head office. The original paper forms are returned to theapplicants. This system prevents customer data leaks at dealers due to accidental misplacement. In
cases of promotional events or service and system updates in which large amounts of customerinformation are handled, we conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment to counter leaks of valuableinformation due to internal errors or hacking attempts.
Regarding criminal investigations and issues related to national security, SK Telecom provides
customer data to national security agencies only after a strict procedure adhering to related regulationssuch as the Protection of Communications Secrets Act. Furthermore, customers can access identitytheft cases via an online system run in cooperation with the Association of Communications andInformation Industries.

In 2007, the TAP (T-DNA Acceleration Program) wascarried out for the 220 teams at SK Telecom from February to April. The program was designed toidentify and seek change necessary to enforce the concept of T-DNA. 
Diverse measures are also being taken to build a creative and truly international organization befitting
a global telecommunications company. First, to create a horizontal and creative organization, weunited various titles under the single “manager” moniker at the end of 2006. We also introduced theBilingual Program and Global Internship Program to create a working environment where people ofdiverse nationalities can work together seamlessly. In 2007, we implemented a trial run of concurrent
Korean and English usage in 30 teams through our bilingual program. The number is being raised to77 teams in 2008 which represents roughly 30% of our organization. 
To support an innovative corporate culture, we incorporated management methodologies such as 6

Particularly in 2007, we carried out processoptimization and standardization for 10 key processes, such as developing new businesses andboosting customer value. To accumulate and better utilize these results of process innovation, weopened the “Work Portal” in October which strengthened our company knowledge-sharing system.Following an organizational reshuffle at the end of 2007 to ground a responsible management systemfor each business, we adopted a “Company In Company” system. This will enable us to moreefficiently conduct our process optimization work in 2008, in addition to internalizing innovativeactivities and strengthening organic ties between systems.

Expert Commentary
22SKT¿ „ﬁ_SR_ˆ `   2008.6.9 6:10 PM  ˘ ` 22    Until now, customer and major stakeholder interest in the environmental aspect of
our business has been relatively low compared to the manufacturing industry, as themobile telecommunications industry is known to have a lesser impact on theenvironment. However, interest is growing in our environmental management, led byglobal investment institutions and local NGOs. In response, we are expanding ourmanagement of environmental data and conducting environment managementactivities centering on issues of interest to stakeholders, such as electromagneticwave radiation from base stations, climate change and recycling used handsets. 
Climate Change
As Korea is not on the list of countries bound to reduce GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol,
climate change-related regulations have received less attention. Nevertheless, SK Telecom has beenworking with various industry and academic institutions, including the Korea Business Council forSustainable Development (KBCSD) and Business Institute for Sustainable Development (BISD), tomonitor trends on related regulations and to participate in industry actions to counter climate change.Climate change is expected to lead to greater costs for many companies, due to extreme weatherconditions and higher oil prices. SK Telecom’s energy consumption structure leaves it more vulnerableto price hikes of indirect energy sources such as electricity, rather than primary energy sources.

Every industry sector, as well as every citizen of the world, has the opportunity and the responsibility to
contribute to making the future more sustainable. Used in the right way ICT can function as an importantenabler of sustainable development, by improving citizens’ quality of life, supporting economic growth andinnovation as well as enabling competitiveness. If we are to be credible in delivering this message then we mustprove our point. ICT companies should be the first to apply the services they market to achieve sustainabilityimprovements. This requires a change of attitude that can only be driven by proper awareness-raising efforts.To fully exploit ICT benefits, cooperation and partnerships are needed with governments and NonGovernmental Organizations in particular, to create the conditions for deployment of technologically advancedproducts and services.

difficult to operate base stations using environmentally friendly energy sources that do not produceCO
2emissions. As of the end of 2007, we have installed 66 small repeaters powered by solar cells for
mainly mountainous regions where electricity supply is irregular. However, operations are hindered bya lack of sunlight and damages incurred by hikers. 
Accordingly, SK Telecom is striving to reduce energy consumption levels, focusing on minimizing use
at offices, as well as by pursuing efficient network operations, and replacing air-conditioners. At thebeginning of every year, all offices set a goal for reducing energy use and awards are given to thebest performers. We are introducing the use of natural air-conditioning systems to reduce electricityuse, as air-conditioning is a necessity in operating network equipment. We plan to only install natural
air-conditioning systems when replacing old air-conditioners. SK Telecom is also encouraging the use
of teleconferencing for business meetings to curtail energy use arising from business trips.
SK Telecom conducts various R&D activities in response to society’s demands for efficient and
environmentally friendly services and products. We provide such services as “T-MAP navigation” whichcalculates the best driving route by considering real-time traffic situations. These services allow ourcustomers to save on travel distance and energy costs. Approximately 400,000 customers subscribethe service at the moment. I   Preventing Global Warming with Natural Air-Conditioners   I
Natural air-conditioners use water as their main coolant. When temperatures dip under a certain level,
direct heat exchanges between water and the atmospheric energy cools the water, reducing the use ofthe large compressor, and thereby producing less energy consumption by more than 50% compared tothe conventional air-conditioning system. Additionally, our natural air-conditioners use water in thecoolant pipes between the indoor and outdoor units of air-conditioners, thereby decreasing the use ofcoolants compared to conventional cooling systems which entirely use chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Byreducing the risk and number of coolant leaks during the installation of the systems, we are contributingto not only preventing global warming but also working to reduce ozone-depleting substances.
SK Telecom began testing systems related to natural air-conditioners in 2001 and supported efforts by
manufacturers to improve their systems for use in base stations. Based on test results at our base
stations collected from 2003 to 2005, we had invested a total of KRW 8.0 billion to install 570 units bythe end of 2007. The investment cost us KRW 4.3 billion more than it would have to install conventionalcooling systems. However, we estimate that environmental benefits for 2007 alone have amounted toreducing approximately 6,000 tons of CO
2and 6 tons of CFCs. Once we replace all of our conventional
systems with the natural air-conditioners, we believe this will translate to annual reductions of 145 GWhin electricity consumption, 61,000 tons in CO
2and 100,000 tons of coolant.

25SK Telecom also developed “D Home service” which allows remote control of home lights and gas
valves to reduce energy use and minimize the risk of gas leaks, and “TPEG Service” which uses aDMB receiver for real-time information on traffic circumstances and accidents to provide the best routeguidance. SK Telecom is currently developing an intelligence building service using ZigBee technologywhich can integrate functions such as securing entrances, asset management, energy managementand monitoring internal environments. 
Electromagnetic Radiation around Base Stations
The enforcement decree and enforcement procedure of the newly revised Radio Waves Act of Korea
took place in 2007. Accordingly, base stations that have transmitter devices with antenna radiating totalpower of over 30W on antenna towers measuring no more than 10m, and are installed near residential,commercial, industrial and management areas must regularly measure electromagnetic fields insurrounding areas. SK Telecom conducted 209 measurements in 2007, up from 47 in 2006, and allmeasurements were lower than levels mandated by the Ministry of Information and Communication.We plan on 828 electromagnetic field measurements in 2008.
The effect of electromagnetic waves on the human body and our environment has not been sufficiently
studied. According to an April 2006 survey of 400 SK Telecom customers living in Korea’s five largestcities, many respondents said that in addition to minimizing electromagnetic waves, they expect thegovernment and telecom operators to provide more objective and accurate information. From 2000 to2004, SK Telecom contributed KRW 750 million for phase one of the “Study on the Effect ofElectromagnetic Radiation on the Human Body”, an initiative led by the Ministry of Information andCommunication with the participation of the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute(ETRI) and Radio Research Laboratory (RRL). The joint study produced the expected results of settingstandards for protecting the human body from electromagnetic waves and of developing devices toprevent exposure to the radiation. However, it did not uncover the impact that mobile phoneelectromagnetic waves have on the body. We are committed to supporting related research and willcontribute a total of KRW 750 million toward the second phase of the five-year study which began in2007. Phase two will continue the epidemiologic study of electromagnetic radiation and influence onthe body, along with measuring the emission levels at base stations.
Handset Recycling
Mobile phones that are discarded without undergoing appropriate procedures pose a threat to the
environment. SK Telecom is working toward the responsible collection and disposal of mobile phones.However, as we cannot demand that customers return handsets when replacing them, the amount ofcollected handsets has been steadily decreasing.

SK Networks Co., Ltd. while 14.8% were sold to a qualified recycling center. As for domestic recyclingfirms, SK Telecom and SK Networks personally visit the businesses to oversee the entire recyclingprocedure for the handset body, battery and charger. In 2007, we made three visits to the recyclingcenter to regulate the disposal process. In August 2007, we launched an event awarding customers whoreturned their handsets with free concert tickets. We then expanded our efforts by launching a collection
campaign with 4,000 schools and retrieved approximately 132,500 handset bodies. Since October 2007,
SK Telecom engaged with other telecom operators in Korea and managed to collect 130,000 usedhandsets in just two months. Their sale raised about KRW 100 million which was then delivered to theCommunity Chest of Korea. In 2008, we plan to execute more efficient collection programs.
Environmental Impact of Our Services
Base Stations and Environment
As of the end of 2007, we had 19 base stations and 42 repeaters installed in environmentally protected
areas. In the process of erecting the nationwide WCDMA network, a number of new base stations andrepeaters were sometimes located in protected areas. Generally however, the total area used for abase station is less than 165m
2and is very unlikely to damage the habitat of wild animals or
endangered species. In the selection of candidate locations for base stations and discussions with landowners, SK Telecom comprehensively considered the opinions of nearby residents as well as theimpact on the ecology and scenery. In 2005, we formed the “Working Group for BuildingEnvironmentally-friendly Base Stations” and established our own standards regarding “green” wirelesssites. At a time when network coverage has reached saturation levels and new repeater installationsare increasing, the number of base stations shared among operators rose dramatically in 2007.
I   Establishing a Standard Model for Eco-Friendly Wireless Sites Reflecting Customer Opinions   I
As the number of antennas increased due to the expansion of new services such as WCDMA, SK
Telecom applied 6 Sigma methodology to the development of an eco-friendly wireless site model whichwould satisfy customers. In 2006, we conducted a survey of 500 outside customers, 200 employees andbusiness partners about the qualities that an eco-friendly antenna must have, which was followed byevaluations by the general public and experts to produce ten standard models. A trial run was thenconducted on satisfaction levels regarding the antennas’ appearance and performance. In 2007, we alsoestablished six standard models for in-building antennas. The models will gradually be adopted beginningwith major city centers.

Vehicles Operated by Operation & Maintenance Business Partners
To reduce harmful gas emissions from vehicles used by business partners in charge of operation and
maintenance of our base stations, SK Telecom plans to stipulate in contracts that our partners usegasoline-run vehicles that comply with Euro 4 standards. In 2007, only eight out of 786 vehiclesoperated by our partners satisfied Euro 4 standards. Considering that Korea started introducing carsthat meet these standards only after October 2007, the ratio is expected to gradually increase.
Reducing Hazardous Substances 
Since 2006, SK Telecom has been using lithium polymer batteries for standby power in optical
repeaters, with such batteries installed in 1,506 repeaters as of the end of 2007. Lithium polymerbatteries are easy to recycle and are more friendly to the environment than lead storage batteries. Inaddition, we intend to replace halogen-based fire extinguishers with more eco-friendly fireextinguishers in new base stations from the second half of 2008.  
Saving Energy and Resources In Using Mobile Telecom Services
Standardization of mobile phone peripherals not only contributes to customer convenience but also
saves resources. Since SK Telecom began supplying standardized chargers in 2003, we haverepeatedly stressed the need for standardized peripherals. As a result, we established a standard 20
pin size for earphones at the end of 2007 and new mobile phones featuring these standardizedearphones are set to be released in 2008.
SK Telecom is also adopting DM (Device Management) technology that can remote control all data
and software contained in a handset from a server. Once a comprehensive remote managementinfrastructure is set up for mobile phones using the technology, we expect to improve our ability toprovide consultations and services to customers, better protect personal data, in addition to reducingresources and energy used in maintaining mobile phones.
We started the nation’s first M billing service in April 2005 which allows subscribers to download their
bills onto their handsets through wireless Internet. In August 2005, we introduced M Customer CenterService to provide subscribers free mobile services such as checking their fees or applying foradditional services. In August 2007, SK Telecom further improved M billing functions, which resulted in3.85 million subscribers or about 20% of all our customers using e-mail and M billing, lowering annualpaper usage by 600 tons. In 2008, we will continue to make upgrades to M billing for greater
convenience and carry on with PR activities to reach our target of having 25% or 5 million subscribers
receive billing statements through their cell phones.

calls by investors, civic groups and other stakeholders for improved corporategovernance. With the re-organization, SK Telecom expanded its autonomous andresponsible management whose focal point is the BOD and has been working toenhance corporate transparency. In recognition of such effort, SK Telecom wasnamed Award of Excellence Winner in an assessment of corporate governance by theKorea Corporate Governance Service in 2007, following Award of Distinction in2005 and 2006.
Corporate Governance
SK Telecom has been working to raise the expertise and independence of the BOD through measures
such as appointing outside directors after input from the Independent Director RecommendationCommittee, in addition to regularly holding Independent Directors Briefings and Independent DirectorsPreliminary Approval Meetings to boost the role of outside directors. Meetings attended by onlyindependent directors were held 33 times in 2006 and 31 times in 2007. Compensation of directors isapproved at the general shareholders’ meeting in accordance to the articles of incorporation andcompany performance.
In 2007, five committees were operated under the BOD - the Audit Committee, the Independent Director
Recommendation Committee, the Compensation Committee, the CapEx Review Committee and theGlobalization Committee. With the exception of the Independent Director Recommendation Committee,the other four committees were all chaired by independent directors. In 2007, the BOD comprised of 12members, eight of whom are independent. However, in March 2008, SK Telecom reduced the numberof directors to eight (three standing directors and five independent directors). 
SK Telecom is promoting internal audit functions through an internal control system based on the
Sarbanes Oxley Act. We are ensuring that the procedure of appointing members to the Audit Committeeis done in a transparent manner while audit operations are independent. We are also striving to reflectemployee and shareholder opinions on our management activities through the general shareholders’meeting and CEO IR activities. In 2007, we held about 430 meetings with external stakeholders to shareinformation on our business activities.
Chul-Ki Ju �Vice President and Secretary General, Global Compact Network Korea 
Numerous issues facing the global economy are highlighting the importance of corporate social responsibility
and thereby spurring expansion of the UN Global Compact. The UN Global Compact represents a firmcommitment to realize sustainability management by promoting ten principles in the areas of human rights,labor, the environment and anti-corruption. Incorporating the ten principles in their core values will enablecompanies to enhance their corporate image and brand value while earning full support of the stakeholders. SKTelecom has been an active member of the Global Compact since 2007. I look forward to seeing SK Telecomgrow into a creative company that leads change and innovation in the era of globalization by embracing theGlobal Compact’s ten principles and pursuing ethical and transparent management.

To create a transparent and fair working environment, SK Telecom is establishing its ethical
management infrastructure such as its Code of Ethics and Ethical Counseling Helpline. In 2007, wecontinued with our ethical management education and conducted EIRM (Ethical Issue Raising &Mapping) activities in 39 teams (979 participants). EIRM activities allow employees to select andmanage ethical risks which may arise in general business activities. In the future, SK Telecom plans to
expand the scope of such activities for preventing ethical risks to include overseas subsidiaries. As part
of such plans, we translated our ethical management handbooks into Chinese and distributed them to
our local staff in China in 2007.
When employees engage in unethical activities and instances of irrational work procedures occur
despite such preventive measures, reports are filed through a direct reporting system to the AuditCommittee chair and the Ethical Counseling Center. Employees found to have clearly violated SKTelecom’s ethics regulations are subject to disciplinary action. The internal process is also beingimproved for a fundamental solution to the possible occurrence of similar cases. In 2007, the number ofdisciplinary actions taken against employees due to violating ethics regulations and other issues was 12. 
Compliance 
In April 2002, a ceremony took place in which all SK Telecom employees pledged to comply with the CP
(Compliance Program). In August 2005, a compliance team was created to systematically manage anyrisks that may occur in various processes of establishing a business model, contracts, sales and PRactivities, such as inflicting damages on customers and limiting competition.
Thanks to these efforts and changes in the regulatory environment which lifted a ban on mobile phone
subsidies, SK Telecom paid a much smaller amount in penalties in 2007. Major causes for the penaltieswere the payment of subsidies, limiting mobile number portability and wrongful subscription to youth feeprograms.

As globalization ushers in a new set of expectations about the role and responsibilities of business in society, it
has become very important for SK Telecom and other global companies to integrate philanthropy into a moreinclusive citizenship strategy. Leading companies are using philanthropy as a crucial asset in bridging businessand social needs and issues. Companies such as SK Telecom will be challenged in corporate philanthropy on anumber of fronts over the next decade. Transitioning from a more traditional giving platform to a more strategicand integrated philanthropy will require those in philanthropy to be more focused on linking philanthropy to  thebusiness, and to becoming more attuned to stakeholder needs and issues. Likewise expanding philanthropy intoa global initiative will be imperative for both the needs of business and society. And finally, companies will bechallenged to use philanthropy to create seeds of innovation, bringing their resources, to assist in addressingand resolving critical and persistent social issues, and linking it to other unique corporate assets of people,technology and business acumen.
Expert CommentaryAt SK Telecom, we believe Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) grounded on the
principles of integrity is crucial to earning public support and trust, a vital element fora company’s sustainability and growth. For us, CSR means proactive socialinvestments needed to address the difficult challenges facing our communities. Thatis why SK Telecom is working with SK affiliates to achieve our corporate mission of“sharing happiness.” We strive to make a real difference in our communities and withthe underprivileged by delivering the benefits of our technology, knowledge andpassion.

Investment in Local Communities 
For our society’s less fortunate, SK Telecom is helping to expand welfare infrastructure, create jobs and
support efforts for self-support and self-reliance through endeavors such as SK Happy Meal Box, 1318Happy Zone and Happy Music School. 
SK Happy Meal Box
We deliver nutritious lunchboxes to children and seniors who are at risk of going hungry. As of the end
of 2007, we operate 29 provision centers across the country and provide more than 10,000 lunches aday. The program has also helped create 500 jobs. Our two centers in Seoul Gwanak and IncheonNam-gu were designated ‘social enterprises’ under the Social Enterprise Supporting Act which tookeffect in July 2007. More than a program that provides free meals and creates jobs, we plan to developSK Happy Meal Box to enrich communities and improve quality of life. 
1318 Happy Zone 
Happy Zone is the name of our support facilities for underprivileged teens between the ages of 13 and
18 who slip through the social welfare safety net. Since the opening of the first center in November2006, 29 Happy Zones have been set up nationwide as of the end of 2007. The facilities offeracademic, cultural, college/crisis counseling programs as well as meal services to more than 1,000teenagers.

represented and disadvantaged backgrounds. A total of 60 students in three musical fields of piano,violin and cello receive one-on-one instructions from Korea’s top professors. The program is aimed atsupporting the students to realize their dreams.
SK Telecom is striving to improve the quality and social impact of our philanthropic endeavors by
regularly conducting satisfaction surveys of our major CSR program beneficiaries and participants. We
have been surveying the health, nutritional state, eating habits and satisfaction rate of children whoreceive various free meals by service type, including SK Telecom’s Happy Meal Box. This comparativesurvey provides us with a basis for improving the health and nutrition of children who are receiving ourmeal service. An assessment index was also developed to measure the performance of 1318 HappyZone. It researches the development index for all teen participants and the results are used to devisemeasures to improve service.
SK Telecom also invests in a wide range of programs aimed at enriching our communities including IT
challenge for teens with disabilities and Habitat-SK Happy Village. We also dispatch teachingassistants to support the integration of disabled children into mainstream education.
Volunteer Activities 
Volunteering is a vibrant part of the SK Telecom culture that brings together employees and customers.
The CEO and senior management take initiative and motivate others to take part in community service.We support employee involvement through several innovative programs including volunteering duringwork hours, family volunteering and year-end volunteering campaign. As of the end of 2007, members
of SK Telecom’s volunteer group averaged 18.6 volunteer hours for the year.

(GRI) G3 Guidelines as a basis for reporting. To fully comply with global standards,we referenced the newly presented G3 guidelines of Indicator Protocol andTelecommunications Sector Supplement.  
Use of Reporting Principles 
GRI G3 Guidelines define reporting principles that a company must comply with to validate the report
scope’s selection process and quality of performance data. Based on these reporting principles, SKTelecom is streamlining the reporting process to obtain stakeholder confidence. In particular, we usedthe following GRI reporting principles to ensure the quality of this report: Materiality, StakeholderInclusiveness, Sustainability Context and Completeness. The procedure for Materiality Assessment isdetailed in “Materiality Assessment” at page 11. 
In 2008, we plan to refine our reporting process by setting up an internal protocol to calculate accurate
data per performance index in accordance with data quality assurance principles. After consideringfuture business competency and outside stakeholders’ demands, we will expand our Report Boundaryby including domestic and overseas invested firms over which SK Telecom exerts significant influence.As part of efforts to facilitate communication with stakeholders in overseas markets where we operate,we will publish a summarized version of our 2007 sustainability report in Chinese and Vietnamese. Wewill continue to strengthen Materiality Assessment competency through active stakeholder engagementand strive to raise the usability and value of the report.

We have declared our firm commitment to respect human rights in our Code of Ethics which stipulates
that “SK Telecom does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or disability.” For the pastfour years, the proportion of our female workforce remained at around 13%. As of April 2008, we,however, do not have any female representation on the board, and there are only three women in thetop posts. 
With the expansion of our overseas operations, we are pursuing a strategy to reduce the number of
employees dispatched from Seoul headquarters and increase local hires. As of the end of 2007,overseas offices recruited some 900 local talents. We are also gradually increasing employmentopportunities for disabled persons and foreigners.
Human Resources Development 
SK Telecom has developed training programs that reflect the changing business environment and the
multi-faceted needs of diverse stakeholders. All employee draw up an “Individual Development Plan”based on the company’s annual training plan after an assessment of individual skills. We offer in-houseand outside education courses and monetary incentives to promote personal and professional growth.In 2007, the average training hours completed per person reached 118 for team leaders and 105 formanagers. 
For efficient development and management of individual careers within the organization, we operate the
innovative “Job-Person Fit System.” It allows employees to track their past duties and career history, setup a mid-to-long term career path and identify their transfer aspiration according to that goal. The resultsare reflected in regular personnel changes aimed at promoting professional growth. All employees arerequired to formulate individual KPI (Key Performance Indicator) before each periodic evaluationthrough the “People Review and Coaching System.” The outcome is included in the personnelperformance report.
To ensure economic security after retirement, SK Telecom offers various support programs including a
class that helps employees adapt to changes after leaving the company. In December 2005, the Koreangovernment introduced the retirement pension system to stabilize the retirement pension. SK Telecomhas yet to implement this system, but we have accumulated a sufficient amount of reserves (outsidereserve ratio of 63.5% in 2007). We plan to introduce the retirement pension system in 2009 in line withthe government policy and broaden the investment scope of our retirement fund.

In 2007, we added CS training for security personnel to enhancecustomer satisfaction. We also commission special agencies such as Korea Security Association to trainour new security personnel. 
Heightened awareness on human rights in Korea is expected to lead to an increased interest in the
subject in our daily lives and developing countries. To further our goals of strengthening and promotinghuman rights principles in business management, we joined the UN Global Compact in 2007. Weconstantly monitor potential human rights violations upon entering new markets and overall globaltrends. In addition, we are expanding exchanges and partnership with related groups. In 2007, wesupported the Korea Center for UN Human Rights Policy program that offers information to Vietnamesewomen marrying Korean males and Amnesty’s Toy Gun Redemption Campaign, which offered books tochildren in exchange for toy weapons. For the month of May, we initiated the “Thank You” campaign tofight the social stigma attached to AIDS and to offer practical help to AIDS patients. The money raisedfrom the campaign was donated to Korea Federation for HIV/AIDS Prevention. SKT¿ „ﬁ_SR_ˆ `   2008.6.9 6:10 PM  ˘ ` 35    2004 2005 2006 20073,7952137581009,351

Annual union membership rate (the actual participation rate among employees eligible for membership)
at SK Telecom remains unchanged at 80%. Based on the labor union agreement, eligibility requirementsfor union membership undergo a slight adjustment every year according to changes in the organization. 
SK Telecom holds prior discussions with the labor union regarding changes in operations that may
negatively affect employees. In 2007, we addressed issues such as changes in employee benefits andwelfare policies, improvements in working conditions and employee stock ownership payment. Anychanges in the company’s articles of incorporation, company name, organizational structure and laborconditions are immediately notified to the labor union. In 2007, we gave post-notification on topicsincluding investment in foreign firms, BOD meeting agenda and changes in organizational structure. 
Supporting Our Business Partners
Our business partners include global electrical and electronics companies supplying main network
equipment, SMEs supplying supplementary equipment such as antennas and repeaters, engineeringand construction companies in charge of facility installation, R&D firms, small-scale contents providersand dealers. We offer a wide array of programs to help our business partners build up their financial,R&D and management capabilities which can in turn enhance their competitiveness. 
Financial Assistance
SK Telecom provides diverse financial assistance for business partners such as fund contributions,
loans secured by future payment streams (Future Flow Collateralized Loan), and loans for dealers. In2007 alone, we extended financial support worth KRW 110 billion to some 360 business partners. 
Reinforcing R&D
We provide idle IT equipment to our SME partners without any charge (worth a total of KRW 2.8 billion
during 2004~2007) to help them reinforce their R&D infrastructure. We operate the Nate BusinessCenter to help reduce our partners’ cost burden associated with the development of new technologyand contents. We are also strengthening our support for SME partners wishing to enter overseasmarkets. In April 2006, we deployed personnel who provide assistance with international businessmatters. Other forms of assistance include free test rooms and infrastructure. In 2007, we providedcontents-related services on 17,000 occasions through the Nate Business Center as well as test bedsand technology consulting.SKT¿ „ﬁ_SR_ˆ `   2008.6.9 6:11 PM  ˘ ` 36    We signed an agreement with the

Enhancing Management Capabilities 
SK Telecom offers some 100 online courses on diverse subjects including management, finance,
marketing and technology via the SK Win-Win Partnership Academy, as well as offline lectures ontopics such as business insight and management training. In 2007, more than 17,000 partner firmmembers participated in our training programs. We also introduced 6 Sigma methodology to ourbusiness partners. In 2007 alone, six business partners carried out eight 6 Sigma tasks. Currently, weoperate a mini-MBA course specialized for the information and communication field with YonseiUniversity and plan to expand the 6 Sigma Management course.

Rewarding Outstanding Business Partners
Every year, SK Telecom holds Partners’ Day to show appreciation to our suppliers. We evaluate major
business partners’ contribution to our overall operations and their potential competencies and rewardoutstanding suppliers. In February 2008, 26 business partners were recognized, up from 24 firms theprevious year. The contributions by outstanding firms are disclosed to all employees through internalbroadcasts and newsletters to instill a sense of pride in our win-win partnerships.
Working with Business Partners for Sustainability 
As many of SK Telecom’s business partners are small-scale enterprises, it has been difficult to request
their uniform participation in social responsibility activities that incur additional costs. To help these firmspursue sustainability management, we are expanding our social responsibility training program tobusiness partners. Since 2006, SK Telecom has been providing free sexual harassment preventioneducation to our business partners via PartnerOn Academy. The program has been well received by oursuppliers with the number of participants growing dramatically. In 2007, 2,181 people from 53 firmssigned up for the class, up from 550 participants from 12 firms in 2006. 
We plan to strengthen our support for building business partners’ sustainability management capacities
by providing free ethics management education in 2008. Moreover, we will take further steps toencourage suppliers to fulfill their responsibilities to society. For instance, we plan to include a socialaccountability clause in the Fair and Transparent Transaction Agreement, which suppliers will berequired to sign, and the annual partner evaluations.

Public Policy Cooperation  
Year 2007 was a landmark that laid out the government’s new framework of regulations with the
announcement of a “mid-to-long term telecommunication policy roadmap.” Its aim is to vitalize themobile communication market to promote consumer welfare. SK Telecom has played an active role informing government policy by introducing a variety of affordable products to broaden user options,submitting recommendations on bundling and resale policy, subsidy regulations, connection feecalculation and frequency policy, and taking part in public hearings and workshops on related issues. 
Starting in 2008, we expect a shift to ex-post regulation, expansion of free competition and pursuance of
telecommunication policy to create a fair competition environment. In addition, we project the creation of aconvergence competition environment such as bundled sales through introduction of policies promotingcompetition among wire, wireless and fusion markets. SK Telecom will continue to work closely withgovernment regulatory agencies to invigorate the entire market and maximize consumer welfare.
Support for Sustainable Development 
Following our declaration in support of the UN Global Compact in May 2007, SK Telecom became an
active participant in creating the Local Network in Korea. We are also joining efforts to expandsustainability management throughout the industry by seeking membership in various sustainability-related agencies in Korea and overseas such as Business for Social Responsibility, Business Institutefor Sustainable Development and Korea Business Council for Sustainable Development. In June 2008,SK Telecom plans to sponsor the UNGC Seoul Conference. 
Managing Environmental Impact of Our Operation
SK Telecom is managing environmental impact data through the Facility Management System (FMS)
centering on our buildings located across the country. 
�Use of Water Resources 
SK Telecom has no water supply source that impacts the environment as we use water supply for
running sanitation facilities and cooling equipment. 
�Waste Generation 
We generate some 6 million liters of waste annually from our offices across the nation. Waste
materials that can be recycled are handled separately.
�Green Purchasing
SK Telecom has been a participant of the Green Purchasing Voluntary Agreement between industry
and the Ministry of Environment since 2005. Accordingly, we have been tracking eco-friendly productpurchases since 2006. In 2007 alone, we purchased KRW 3.6 billion worth of green productsincluding office furniture, OA equipment and office supplies.

To the readers of the SK Telecom 2007 Sustainability Report
Introduction
We have been engaged by SK Telecom Co.,Ltd. to review specified information in SK Telecom 2007
Sustainability Report (further referred to as The Report ). The Report is the responsibility of the
company’s management. Our responsibility is to issue an assurance report in relation to the scopedescribed below.
Context and Scope
In The Report SK Telecom describes its efforts and progress in relation to sustainability and reporting.
Our engagement was designed to provide the readers of The Report with: 
■reasonable assurance on whether the data on financial performance, as specified in the section
‘Work Undertaken and Conclusions’ are properly derived from the 2007 Non-consolidated financialstatements of SK Telecom Co.,Ltd. 
■limited assurance on whether:
- the data on the total greenhouse gas emissions, annual volunteer hours per person and disposing
collected handsets for the year 2007 are reliable;
- the information in the following sections of The Report is fairly stated:
�Our Journey towards Sustainability (pages 9 to 10);
�Customer Care (pages 17 to 20);
�Innovative Workplace (pages 21 to 22);
�Green ICT (pages 23 to 27);
‘Fairly stated’ means that The Report properly reflects the information contained in the underlying
sources such that it is consistent with the source information.Reasonable assurance is a higher level of assurance than limited assurance, which is reflected in thenature and depth of the work performed. To obtain a thorough understanding of the financial resultsand financial position of SK Telecom Co.,Ltd., the reader should consult the SK Telecom audited Non-consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Reporting Criteria
There are no generally accepted standards for reporting sustainability performance. SK Telecom
Co.,Ltd. applies its own internal sustainability performance reporting criteria, in addition to using the2006 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative. 
Standards 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance
Engagements (ISAE 3000): ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of HistoricalFinancial Information’, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Amongstothers this standard requires that:
■the assurance team members possess the specific knowledge, skills and professional competenciesneeded to understand and review the information in 
The Report , and that they comply with the
requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants to ensure their independence;
■when providing limited assurance, which is a lower level than reasonable assurance, a negative formof conclusion is used.
Considerations and Limitations
Environmental, health, safety and social performance data are subject to inherent limitations given their
nature and the methods used for determining, calculating and estimating such data.

Work Undertaken and Conclusions
■Financial data
We have reconciled the data on financial performance in the section of The Report listed below, with
the audited 2007 Non-consolidated financial statements of SK Telecom Co.,Ltd. 
�The section ‘Creation and Distribution of Economic Value’ on page 8
Based on the above, the data on financial performance, as specified above are properly derived fromthe 2007 Non-consolidated financial statements of SK Telecom Co.,Ltd. for which the independentauditors issued an unqualified audit opinion dated January 31, 2008. 
■Specific sections
For the reliability of the data on the total greenhouse gas emissions, annual volunteer hours perperson and disposing collected handsets for the years 2004 to 2007 we conducted:
�a review of the data reported by reporting organizations;
�a review of the systems used to generate, aggregate and report these data;
�a review of the data validation process at product division level;
�a review of the calculation made at corporate level;
Based on the above, the data on the total greenhouse gas emissions, annual volunteer hours perperson and disposing collected handsets for the year 2007 do not appear to be unreliable.
For the information in the sections of 
The Report , as specified above under ‘Context and Scope’ we
conducted:
�a media and internet search to obtain insight into the relevant sustainability aspects in the reportingperiod;
�a review of the systems and processes used to generate this information;
�a review of internal documentation and intranet sources;
�interviews with staff in order to assess the information included in the specific sections;
Following our review we discussed changes to the draft Report with SK Telecom and reviewed the
final version of The Report to ensure that it reflected our findings. 
Based on the above, the information in the sections, Our Journey towards Sustainability, CustomerCare, Innovative Workplace and Green ICT does not appear to be unfairly stated. 
Commentary
Without affecting the conclusions presented above, we believe that following information could be useful
to the readers’ decision-making process.
SK Telecom is providing sustainability information reliable to its stakeholders by implementing the
materiality test in The Report . We recommend that SK Telecom pay attention to enhancing the
evaluation process of grasping and managing sustainability issues. In addition, SK Telecom needs toreport on the sustainability performance of its subsidiaries and to attune reporting criteria to support thereporting process.
We have discussed our observations regarding the reporting process and report outside the scope of
our assignment with SK Telecom management. We found them receptive to our comments.
