With a thriving workforce of more than 30,000, we believe 
that our employees are the cornerstone of our business. Therefore, we are committed to providing an industry-leading working environment to enable all employees to reach their full potential as they ‚ÄúMake Every Trip the

In recognition of the importance of diversity and inclusion, we 
have introduced an Equality and Diversity Policy which applies to all current and prospective employees. It stipulates guiding principles in prohibiting discrimination in the recruitment process or at the workplace on the basis of sex, pregnancy, marital status, family status, disability, and race. Our employees are rewarded with competitive remuneration based on factors such as average salary standards, professional competence and work performance. We are committed to providing a range of attractive benefits such as medical care, maternity and child welfare, travel benefits and a range of leave entitlements. 
Staff communication is essential 
in upholding healthy and harmonious work relations. We adopt various communication channels such as a monthly HR Open Day, suggestion mail box, departmental meetings and bi-annual satisfaction surveys. Through these methods, we gather feedback from our staff with regards to their interests and any potential areas for improvement.
During the reporting year and to the best of our knowledge, 
there were no reported cases of non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations that have a material impact on the Group relating to compensation, dismissal, recruitment, promotion, working hours, rest periods, equal opportunity, diversity, anti-discrimination, other benefits and welfare including maternity and paternity leave, safe working environment, protecting employees from occupational hazards, and preventing child and forced labour.

Our policies govern issues in relation to responsible travel including quality assurance and 
protection of intellectual property rights, customer data and privacy. One of our strengths 
is independent quality assurance governed by our Quality Management System which 
details the responsibilities of relevant departments as well as implementation, monitoring 
and improvement procedures. To ensure our service quality, we have established customer 
complaint handling procedures and a fair and independent process for complaint 
investigations. This year, we further optimised the user interface and system design of our 
Artificial Intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù) Customer Service System. As a result of the enhancement, our 
AI response rate in 2019 increased by 35% compared to last year.Responsible Travel Across Our Value Chain
Providing Emergency Response
Services for Travelers
Guided by the ‚ÄúSafety First‚Äù principle for  all our customers, we have
developed our Global SOS Emergency Response platform which
provides assistance to travelers in times of crisis. Apart from major
incidents, travelers can also seek support on the platform for more
common issues encountered during international travel, including
seeking medical assistance and recovering lost possessions.
On 17 June 2019, a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Yibin
in Changning County. The devastation resulted in 13 casualties as 
well as more than 200 injuries. In response to the unpredictable 
massive destruction, we activated our Global SOSEmergency Response mechanism. Various departments including 
air ticketing, accommodation, vacation, and customer service 
responded jointly in order to provide diverse types of support for 
affected customers. Our assistance included full reimbursement of 
air tickets, car rentals, package tours, and hotel bookings.

OUR VALUE CHAINWith over 300 million members registered on our platform, we understand that our customers place a great 
deal of trust in us to handle and protect their personal data and privacy. Our Customer Data and Privacy 
Protection Policy outlines our approach and commitment to protecting customer information. In 2019, we 
adopted the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management Systems to bring information security 
under management control. 
Due to our rapid business development in recent years, intellectual property rights and patent protection 
has become one of our Group‚Äôs key focus areas. Under our comprehensive Patent Management System, 
training opportunities and incentive mechanisms are provided to our employees who wish to develop their 
expertise in technological innovation. Furthermore, we have established a patent team responsible for 
patent application matters and reporting invention progress to management. At present, the Group has 
around 600 patents under approval process and a total of 459 approved patents. Responsible Travel Across Our Value ChainResponding to Emerging Laws
and Regulations
We make every effort to address potential regulatory risks that
may significantly affect our business. The General Data Protection
Regulation (‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù) is a recently implemented regulation in the
European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù) focused on data protection and privacy for all
individual citizens of the EU and the European Economic Area. Before
implementation of the GDPR on 25 May 2018, the Group established
a dedicated task force to ensure we are ready to meet the regulation
requirements. The task force implemented the following measures:
‚Ä¢ Conducted data mapping to streamline data processes
‚Ä¢ Managed relationships between data controllers and
data processors (including handling cross-border data
transfers)‚Ä¢ Implemented data subject rights procedures and 
control mechanisms
‚Ä¢ Updated our Customer Data and Privacy Protection 
Policy, enhanced data incident / security breach 
notifications and response mechanisms
‚Ä¢ Established Data Protection Officer positions
The measures were implemented over the course of one year and 
the results sufficiently respond to the corresponding data subject's 
claims and comply with the GDPR. We will identify enhancement 
opportunities to ensure personal data protection factors are taken 
into account during system design and operation.

Promotion of Sustainable Tourism
Our business portfolio connects us to a wide range of stakeholders, including travellers, 
business partners, NGOs and regulatory bodies, around the globe. Building on this strength, we have been implementing initiatives related to sustainable tourism over the years. In 2019, we partnered with The United Nations Development Programme (‚ÄúUNDP‚Äù), Chinese International Centre for Economic and Technical Exchanges (‚ÄúCICETE‚Äù) and China Tourism Academy (‚ÄúCTA‚Äù) to establish the ‚ÄúTravel for Good Alliance‚Äù which aims to bring industry partners together to share best practices and practical management tools. Currently, more than 20 travel companies as well as environmental groups have joined to explore innovative ways to foster environmentally responsible travel. 
We see waste disposal as a pressing issue to be addressed in the hospitality 
industry. As such, the alliance co-launched the ‚ÄúTravel More, Impact Less‚Äù environmental campaign with the aim to reduce wastage of single-use hotel supplies and to enrich travellers‚Äô environmental awareness. Hotels participated in our campaign encourage guests to recycle daily necessities in hotel rooms and minimize the negative impact on environment from traveling. Seven Langham hotels in China was the first batch of pilot hotels to actively pr omote this public 
welfare project, and we strive to promote wider participation amongst our industry partners to foster sustainable tourism in a collaborative manner.

Energy Reduction
As a responsible corporate citizen, we recognise our role in combating the global challenge of 
climate change. Considering our business nature, our carbon reduction measures focus mainly on reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency at our headquarters. Designed as a green building, our headquarters was awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold precertification with several implemented environmental initiatives including the application of an intelligent building energy management system and the use of solar energy. At our office premises, we continue to identify energy-saving opportunities through technological upgrades. For instance, we have replaced all obsolete lighting fixtures with LED lamps and enhanced our intelligent lighting control system, measures which have helped reduce our annual electricity consumption by approximately 519,000 kWh and 347,000 kWh, respectively. 
Dedicated to promoting low carbon travel, we are the 
first travel company in Mainland China to initiate a carbon offsetting programme, Ctrip Forests, to mitigate environmental impacts associated with our business activities. Since 2008, Ctrip Forests has served as a platform providing customers with information regarding their carbon footprint and rewarding customers who choose carbon offsetting options
2 with ‚Äúsapling points‚Äù that can 
be redeemed as tree saplings. In collaboration with China Green Foundation, Ctrip has planted more than 1.1 million of trees across Beijing and Inner Mongolia over the years. 
2 Ctrip offers customers a wide range of carbon offsetting options, including the use of low carbon 
transport such as environmentally-friendly buses and bikes.21

Trip.com Group is dedicated to contributing to the communities we serve all over the world. We have been upholding our 
Corporate Social Responsibility philosophy ‚Äúbe an excellent corporate citizen in the world‚Äù by carrying out charity work for more than a decade in China. Initiated in 2017, our ‚ÄúTransport Public Welfare + Poverty Alleviation through Tourism‚Äù scheme provides 100 travel packages which aim to promote the local economy and alleviate poverty in more than 1,000 tourist destinations in China. Since 2018, the Group has expanded our charity efforts overseas and travelled extensively throughout the Middle East and West Africa to understand the medical and health conditions faced by local children and the strong need for support and basic facilities in these areas. In response, we organised resources and provided materials and construction assistance to communities in need based in the Middle East and West Africa. In 2019, we strengthened our community investment commitments around the world by establishing ‚ÄúSTAR‚Äù, our long-term social responsibility strategy. Under this strategy, we plan to invest 10 million RMB in 50 charity projects through our newly launched public welfare platform.

Caring for the Community
Alleviating Poverty in China
This year marks the 27th anniversary of the declaration of 17 October as the 
International Day for the Eradication of Poverty by the United Nations General Assembly and the 6th anniversary of China‚Äôs National Poverty Relief Day which promote public awareness of the need to eradicate poverty. In support of the events, Ctrip announced the opening of offline stores in over 450 county-level cities, including 16 poverty counties, to promote local entrepreneurship. This initiative can help poverty alleviation by creating employment and driving sustainable tourism in the rural areas. 
Fighting Severe Malnutrition in Sierra Leone
Last year, the Group engaged the local community in the Republic of Sierra Leone by providing food and clinical support to improve the quality of living. In 2019, our volunteers travelled to Sierra Leone to support mothers and infants at local clinics in the fight against malnutrition and hunger. They also provided educational assistance and donated laptops to local schools, promoted health awareness through sporting events and environmental awareness through tree-planting activities.
Raising Environmental Awareness in Rural Malaysia
In September 2019, 15 employees from our Singapore and Malaysia offices took part in a volunteering project in a school located in a rural village in Sabah, Malaysia. We donated supplies such as projectors, whiteboards, stationery and sports equipment to over 100 primary school students from low-income rural families. Our volunteers also highlighted the importance of recycling through a workshop where they crafted creative art projects from discarded materials.

Educating Students about Haze in Indonesia 
In October 2019, our volunteers travelled to Palembang, Indonesia to provide 
haze management guidance as well as an educational activity for students affected by the toxic haze. We delivered essential provisions including masks and school equipment for the students. The haze management education and provisions delivered served to motivate students to be more aware of the haze hazard.
Visiting a Local Orphanage in Vietnam
On 27 July 2019, employees from our Vietnam office visited a local orphanage in Ho Chi Ming City. Aside from contributing funds and daily supplies to the orphanage, our employees spent time taking care of and playing with the orphans.
