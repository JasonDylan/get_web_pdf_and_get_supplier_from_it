A Message to Our Stakeholders
Long before we opened our first Target store in suburban 
Minneapolis, our company was founded with a deeply held belief that the enduring success of our business relies on the strength and vitality of the communities  we serve.
Fifty-six years later, not only do we still believe in  
that essential connection between business and  community, we have broadened our philosophy  on corporate responsibility.
Today, our team – almost 350,000 strong – is rallied 
around a single, unifying aspiration: to help all families discover joy in everyday life.
Inspired by that purpose, we are building on our legacy 
of philanthropy and volunteerism. We see opportunity to use every dimension of our business to make a positive impact. That means leveraging our size, scale and core strengths to create value for our teams, our guests, our communities and investors, and the planet we share.
This work is about more than doing what is right by  
our stakeholders. It is about using our purpose to guide every choice and every critical business decision we make. And it represents a significant step change  
in the way we are prioritizing our investments and  
deploying our resources. We have organized our  
corporate responsibility strategy around four key  
themes: empowering our teams, serving our guests, fostering our communities and designing for our future.
Throughout this report, you will see many examples of 
this work coming to life all across our company – from how we are challenging our teams and vendors to develop cleaner, healthier products to the ways we are building and operating some of the most sustainable buildings in retail.
We will share how we are championing diversity and 
inclusion across our workforce and throughout our  business, positioning our stores as hubs for community and creating new spaces to bring kids and families together. You will see new policy positions on chemicals and water use, as well as how we are finding new ways to support a more circular economy.
And, finally, you will see where we think we can drive 
immediate impact by investing in our team.
Last fall, we took a leadership position on wage –  
moving to $11 an hour for a starting wage and  committing to $15 by 2020. We raised our starting  wage again this spring, to $12. And we are investing in new training opportunities, at every level of the company, so that our team members can develop new skills and deeper expertise, become better leaders and ultimately build rewarding careers at Target and beyond.
But paying more is only part of the equation. Pay must 
also be equitable. We have a long-standing practice  of paying our team members equitably regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. And we regularly audit to  ensure we uphold that commitment, because treating  all team members fairly is a non-negotiable.
While our corporate responsibility ambitions are global in 
scale and cut across multiple sectors and constituencies,  
we are approaching this work with a great sense of  humility. Driving meaningful results and change takes time, focus, patience and partnership.
Said another way, this work is a journey. And while  
we have a long way to go, I am proud of our progress. Every action we take that strengthens the health and  vitality of the communities where we live is a step  forward in building a better, brighter future for Target  and the people we serve.

A Message to Our Stakeholders    3� 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportQ&A With Our Vice President of Corporate Responsibility
Q:  Target has taken a journey when it comes to  
corporate responsibility. How has it evolved? 
A:  We learned a great deal in 2017 from the journey of 
creating our new corporate responsibility strategy.  
This strategy marks a pivot in the role that corporate 
responsibility plays in Target’s business. It is evolving from primarily philanthropy to linking business and  
societal value; from a singular issue to driving multi-faceted positive impact; from being stand-alone to being woven into all we do; and from pockets of action to enterprise-wide engagement. It has allowed us to ensure that corporate responsibility is truly  
delivering on Target’s purpose and is poised to ensure we have a thriving business now and into the future. 
Q:  What was the case for change?
A:  Our operating environment has radically shifted, and we needed to evolve and adapt. Guest expectations of all retailers, including Target, are rising, and their purchasing decisions are increasingly being motivated by concerns like whether a retailer has committed to sustainable business practices or taken a stand on an issue that matters to them. We had a huge opportunity to better serve this guest need. 
We had to build foundational elements into our  
strategy in terms of issues that could pose risk for a 
business of our size. There also was an opportunity for us to better use corporate responsibility to drive competitive advantage by doing things in a way that leverages Target’s unique assets and strengths as a business. And most of all, we could also see untapped business opportunity; we look at businesses driving significant revenue via their corporate responsibility strategies and aim to maximize our ability to capture 
this opportunity for Target.
Q: What corporate responsibility achievements are 
you most proud of in 2017? 
A:  One of the achievements I am most proud of is our 
continued dedication to delivering on guests’ rapidly changing needs and preferences. In response to our guests’ desire for clean, transparent products, we recently began rolling out a common framework for what is considered nutritious, clean, transparent and responsibly sourced. Starting in January of this year, we began in-store and online implementation of our Wellness Product Standards. Through iconography  
depicting key attributes, such as organic or cruelty-  
free, we hope to make it easier for guests to access and understand our carefully curated selection of  
products that are better for you, your family or the planet. 
And beyond the shelf, we are working to ensure  
our products are made using natural resources  
responsibly. We have made progress already by  
establishing cotton, forest products and packaging 
policies and commitments, and are working on issuing a deforestation statement as well. These are just a few ways we are delivering on our promise to improve our products to align with guest preferences and values 
and help make a positive impact.
Q:  Many corporate responsibility initiatives that  
improve the bottom line in the long term do not pay off initially. How do you bring along  stakeholders in that early stage when there  will not be an immediate payoff?
A:  Our leadership is intentional about creating the right  
incentives and motivations to get stakeholders  
onboard with initiatives that do not immediately  
contribute to our bottom line. For instance, we knew 
our goal to add solar rooftop panels to 500 of our stores and distribution centers by 2020 would require having a long-term vision. In 2017, we added more than 65 megawatts of solar across 86 new solar projects – more than any other U.S. retailer, and are well on our way to reaching our goal. This would not have been possible without the support, insights and engagement of our stakeholders who understand that to make a significant impact, we must think beyond 
the short term.Q:  What excites you the most about this new strategic 
direction for corporate responsibility at Target? 
A:  The four pillars of the strategy each contain a big 
idea. When it comes to our team, we are hard at work thinking about how to make our jobs among the most rewarding in retail, and I am so proud of our initial commitment to get team members to $15 an hour by 2020 – and that is just the beginning. For our guests, I am excited to bring the core Target competency in eliminating tradeoffs to bear on the choices guests too often have to make between affordability, efficacy and sustainability. I am also thrilled that the growth of our joyful new private-label brands will be powered by helping our guests meet their need for value and values. When it comes to our community pillar, we are  
essentially reimagining the role a retailer plays in a  
community so our presence helps power the prosperity and well-being of whole communities. As a  
company, we are reasserting the case for bricks and mortar, while not slowing down as we innovate to become a best in class digital retailer. And it is a privilege to bring the power of Target’s design prowess to the exciting challenge of how we make the circular economy a mainstream part of our products and of our guests’ shopping and consumption behaviors. It feels like a blueprint for retail 2.0, and a way for us to truly stand behind our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life.

2017 Year in Review    5Our Corporate 
Responsibility  Strategy
Corporate Responsibility Strategy    6� 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportOur Corporate Responsibility Strategy 
We call our corporat
e responsibility strategy Future at 
Heart, and it encapsulates our ambition to put the needs of 
people, communities and the planet at the heart of how we work today, to help create a better tomorrow. 
While it builds on our heritage as a responsible business, 
Future at Heart represents an exciting step in our  corporate responsibility ambitions. Aligned with Target’s broader business transformation and guided by Target’s purpose, Future at Heart is designed to leverage our core strengths and lean into our competitive advantage to create value for the people, communities and planet that we serve – today and tomorrow.
Future at Heart is the result of a process to re-imagine our 
corporate responsibility vision and better connect it to our purpose and strategic priorities. In partnership with teams across the business, we asked ourselves some provocative questions: How can our owned-brand products and brands evolve so guests do not have to choose between value and values? How can we ensure a job at Target enables team members to care for themselves and their families? How can we elevate the well-being of the people in our manufacturing supply chain communities? How can our stor
es accelerate economic prosperity in our communities, 
especially traditionally underserved communities? How can we use philanthropy to drive transformative change on the issues impacting our business and society today and  tomorrow? And how can our world-class designers  embrace a circular mindset to envision a business that leaves the world better for future families? 
Future at Heart is our response to these questions – and 
to changing social and environmental realities. We have set four strategic ambitions – Empower Teams, Serve Guests, Foster Communities and Design Tomorrow. 
It has wide-ranging implications for our business – on how 
we design and develop our products and brands, thinking about both beginning and end-of-life and the natural  resources we need; on where we locate new stores and how we partner with local communities; on how we design work for our team members t
o make it rewarding and joyful; 
and on how guests experience our products and stores every time they go on a Target run or shop online.  
This is just the beginning. As one of the largest employers  
in the United States, with stores in more than 1,800  communities and more than 30 million guest visits every week, we have a significant opportunity to drive change at scale and deliver joy to all families today and tomorrow. If we are successful, Future at Heart will help us create an even stronger workforce, empower guests to make healthy and responsible choices and contribute to thriving  communities and a healthy environment. It should also help us attract and retain the best team in retail, earn us guest love and loyalty, make Target a welcome neighbor in every community and be responsive to shifting environmental realities, building a successful business for the long term. 
That is what Future at Heart is all about.

We Strive to Ensure Target  
Team Members & Manufacturing Supply Chain Workers Thrive
Our team members are what the Target brand is all 
about. As we look toward the future, we are continuing to invest in our nearly 350,000 team members and create good jobs that allow them to thrive. We believe an investment in them is an investment in the future of our business, and should also deliver joy to all families by first including the families of our team members.
The world of work today is changing, and what team 
members need from a job at Target is changing as well. There is no one-size-fits-all. So, we are evolving our approach by being responsive to team members' needs and giving them opportunities to develop skills for their future. We believe in fostering a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace that provides equitable  opportunities for our team members.
We also desire to improve the livelihoods of workers 
throughout our global manufacturing supply chain,  striving to elevate worker well-being, enhance worker safety and work to eliminate forced labor, if discovered.To Empower Teams, we 
are focusing on  three key areas:
Economic Attainment & Well-being
We provide competitive compensation  
and benefits that enable Target team  members to meet their needs. 
Meaningful Work & Opportunity
We foster a diverse and inclusive  workplace that provides experiences to learn, grow and make a difference for our guests and their communities.
Global Livelihoods
We strive to enhance worker safety,  well-being and economic opportunity throughout our manufacturing supply chain.

Team Member: As of February 3, 2018, 
we employed nearly 350,000 full time, part 
time and seasonal employees, referred to 
as “team members.” Team members include 
store employees.
Manufacturing Supply Chain Workers:  
All vendors, suppliers, manufacturers,  
contractors, subcontractors and their 
agents.� 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportTarget Team
As one of the largest employers in the United States,  
we understand the value of the people that serve our guests every day. Our team is an important part of what sets Target’s shopping experience apart. We believe that, in return for putting their best foot forward every day at Target, we have a responsibility to provide our team members with the resources and experiences they need to grow and thrive. 
Economic Attainment  
& Well-being 
Target has a long history of investing in our team by  
giving them opportunities to grow professionally, take care of themselves, each other and their families and make a difference for our guests and their communities. We believe that taking care means investing in one’s whole self, both at and outside of work. 
Competitive Pay & Benefits 
We recognize the impact increased wages have on our team members’ ability to sustain financial stability and look after themselves and the people they love. That is why we have committed to pay all team members a  minimum hourly wage of at least $15 by the end of 2020. We moved to an $11 minimum hourly wage in 2017. And, we took the next step by moving to a $12 minimum hourly wage earlier this year, starting with our existing team members.
This represents a major investment in our team, which 
should enable us to continue recruiting and retaining strong team members, ultimately delivering on an  elevated experience for our guests and for the  communities we serve.Empowering our team members is about more than  just pay. We have also expanded upon the training and support for them to build skills, develop professionally and continue to offer expertise and industry-leading service to our guests. 
We offer health and wellness programs for eligible team 
members, including health care benefits, paid parental leave, paid short-term disability and optional long-term disability. 
From their first day on the job, we provide eligible team 
members with a large portfolio of benefits, discounts and perks. On top of a 10 percent team member discount, a few of the additional benefits that set us apart include:
• Wellness Savings: Wellness products are not just  
for our guests to enjoy. We offer team members an 
additional 20 percent wellness discount on fresh fruits and vegetables, Simply Balanced products and  C9 Champion athletic merchandise at Target and  Target.com. In the first two years of the offering,  team members and their families have saved over  $22 million. 
• Team Member LifeResources: We believe taking 
care of our team means investing in their whole selves, both at and outside of the workplace, and we seek to enhance the well-being of our team and their families. Our Team Member LifeResources (TMLR) offering  exceeds the average employee assistance program. All team members and their entire household have free, 24/7 access to trained clinicians who offer guidance and support in various facets of personal well-being. This includes up to five free counseling sessions, per issue, per year, for team members and their entire household. We also have in-store  counselors in over 160 stores to support our team members. As we look toward the future 
and all of the investments we are 
making in our business – from 
our reimagined stores to our 
supply chain – our team is at the 
center of bringing it all to life. So, 
we are investing more than ever 
in pay, hours, development and 
training opportunities for our 
team. 
-  Stephanie Lundquist,  
Chief Human Resources Officer, Target
By the end of 2020, we have committed to pay  
all team members a minimum hourly wage of at 
least $15. 
This represents a major investment in our team.  
And it is helping strengthen our business and better 
serve our guests, by allowing more team members 
to think about building a long-term future with 
Target. 
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Empower Teams    9� 2018 Corporate Responsibility Report• 
Financial Resources: We have supported our team’s 
continued education by offering tuition reimbursement  for more than 20 years, including investing more than  $46 million over the past five years to support team members pursuing their GED, undergraduate and  graduate degrees. We also offer access to the Target Credit Union and budgeting tools, as well as a  dollar-for-dollar 401(k) match for eligible team  members, up to five percent of eligible pay.
• Flexible Scheduling: We know our team appreciates 
the opportunity to work a variety of schedules at  Target. In fact, 40 percent of our workforce are  student or retiree age and are looking to build  schedules around their availability. With input from  our team members, we post store schedules no later than 10 days in advance, allow store team members to trade and pick up shifts at their store location and do not do on-call or snap scheduling. We also know that, while some team members have limited availability, others would like to take on additional hours. So in the past year and a half, we have introduced more specialty positions and added millions of payroll hours. 
Pay Equity
Target cares deeply about and values the team that comes together, every day, to serve our guests. We try to provide meaningful and interesting work, as well as career growth and development opportunities for the nearly 350,000 teammembers who work at Target. We also understand the importance of providing equitable pay to all team members based on their experience, expertise and position. And this is not just our goal or policy – it is living out our company values of treating team members fairly. 
Our latest pay audit of U.S. team members confirmed that. 
Taking into account relevant factors such as position, tenure and location, Target pays team members equitably,  regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. We are proud of this and know that maintaining equity requires an ongoing, dedicated focus and commitment. 
To get to this point, we engage in several meaningful  
routines with our team. We provide training and tools to those responsible for hiring and compensation decisions  to reduce the threat of bias, whether conscious or  unconscious, affecting decision making. We removed  questions about prior salary from most hiring situations so we are less likely to perpetuate previous pay gaps for  qualified job candidates. And, we regularly conduct pay audits to ensure pay is fair and equitable across the team. 
However, we recognize this important work will require 
ongoing effort. We will continue to conduct regular pay audits and address any issues we may find. A diverse and 
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Empower Teams    10inclusive t
eam is a better team, which results in a better 
 experience for all our guests. We believe that when we  build our teams through equitable treatment, including  equitable pay, we ultimately build a better Target.
Crisis & Disaster Support 
We want to be there for our team members when they need it most, especially before, during and after a crisis or disaster. In 2017, as team members across the country were impacted by Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma and devastating wildfires, Target’s Disaster Assistance Program helped nearly 2,500 team members with more than  $1 million immediately after the natural disasters. 
On top of that, team members raised an additional 
$550,000 by donating to a fund that Target matched, dollar-for-dollar, to support nearly 600 fellow team members impacted by the hurricanes.
We also offer closure pay to eligible team members if their 
stores are temporarily closed and look to transfer team members to another store in their area if their store will be closed longer than a week. 
Most recently, we created a Team Member Giving Fund, 
which allows team members to donate through a third- party to help fellow team members in times of hardship, such as house fires or serious illness. 
� 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportMeaningful Work &  
Opportunities
We strive to support team members with the chance to 
learn, as well as earn, and want to empower them to do their best work. And we support them on their career journey, finding new growth opportunities and  experiences.
Education & Skills
As we continue to design and evolve jobs for the  changing retail environment, we are doing so with the goal of preparing our team members for success, at Target and beyond. Our team members engage with over 30 million guests each week. We believe that an investment in our team members’ development is an investment in the experience they create for our guests every day. 
Training & Development
We have initiated several programs that provide  eligible team members with paid training and education on retail business management, guest service and  product assortment. The training is fully paid and helps our team gain skills while better serving our guests. 
We expect to continue to invest hundreds of thousands 
of paid training hours to develop a sales force of experts across the business by building our team members’ product knowledge, developing service skills and  implementing continuous learning programs. For our store teams, we have invested significant payroll hours  in onboarding for new team members, as well as  certification programs and training in specialty areas of the store, like beauty, apparel and electronics. In 2017, team members participated in 325,000 hours of these specialty training opportunities. We have brought  on-demand learning to our team’s fingertips through mobile device-led training that allows them to learn on the sales floor and engage real-time with guests on the latest trends and information.
We have also engaged our vendors to visit stores and 
help train our team members on new products, so they can better represent them for our guests. And, we  have brought in service and sales training experts to  help our team members learn more about creating a welcoming, inspiring and rewarding guest experience. Training developed for our store leaders will help them build critical leadership skills to effectively coach their teams and reinforce positive behaviors. 
Skills-based Volunteerism 
Our teams engage in skills-based volunteerism as a way to share their unique skills and talents by using them to address unmet needs within the broader community.
As an example, in 2017, more than half of the lawyers, 
paralegals and administrators on Target’s Legal Affairs team lent their time and legal know-how to pro-bono work in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area and beyond. From helping people apply for DACA status to creating wills free of charge for local first responders, the Legal Affairs team spent hundreds of hours sharing their expertise in service to their local communities. This marks the sixth consecutive year this team has exceeded the national benchmark for pro-bono service among corporate legal departments. 
We also put our design chops to good use in our  
hometown of Minneapolis, when our in-house design team designed the official Super Bowl LII volunteer uniforms pro-bono for the more than 10,000 volunteers who supported festivities surrounding the big game. 
Supporting Our Communities
Coming together as one team extends beyond our Target family to every community we serve. Building on our long history of supporting communities where we operate, each year we work toward a goal to volunteer 1 million hours and encourage our team members to participate in our annual Team Member Giving  Campaign. In 2017, our team members exceeded  our goal, volunteering nearly 1.1 million hours of their time. Additionally, our team members donated  approximately $9.3 million to nonprofit organizations across the country as part of the campaign.
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Empower Teams    11� 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportDiverse Workforce  
& Inclusive Workplace
We aim to champion a more inclusive society and to  
deliver inclusive guest experiences by embracing diversity and giving everyone access to the same opportunities. Hiring and retaining diverse talent, increasing diverse  representation at all levels and every member of our team having equitable experiences are critical to delivering on  our aspiration. An intentional focus on a workforce that represents the spectrum of guest perspectives, and a  workplace that supports and enables those perspectives to exist within our business objectives, is what will help us deliver on behalf of our guests. We are proud of where we are, but will continue to evolve our approach in alignment with Target's purpose and strategy.
The Bullseye, Your Brain and its Bias
Investing in the inclusion acumen of our team through  immersive experiences, fueling individual curiosity and topical trainings were main focuses in 2017 and will also continue to be in 2018. In order for our team to feel safe being authentic individually and co-exist with other team members' authenticity, it was important to help our team understand how to manage their bias. We launched bias training to provide our team with tools to recognize and manage bias and to understand how our similarities and differences can enhance our team and our business. 
We are taking a thoughtful approach to how we roll it out 
to our full organization. We started with taking 7,000 of our headquarters team members through a three-hour bias training session that equated to 21,000 hours of training. 
In addition, we are embedding bias training for our team 
members into regular training that they have throughout the year, as well as for new team members joining Target. The format of the training will vary depending on the team member and their position, but includes a variety of online training modules, classroom training and team  conversations.

Living Our Inclusivity Value
In Safe Hands
In 2017, the Muslim Network hosted a "What is Ramadan?" 
event to help our team understand more about the experienc-es of our team members of Muslim faith. Two team members who attended the event also ended up becoming the mentor and manager for an intern of Muslim faith. Because of what they learned during the event, they were able to prepare the existing team with information that helped them welcome the intern, as well as have resources available for her to exercise her faith. As a result, the onboarding experience created a sense of belonging that made the intern feel safe at Target.

As we continue to service a broader spectrum of guests, it is crucial to our business to have differing perspectives present. So, when a first generation Arab-American  
began working as a team member in one of our  
California stores, the store leader recognized that he was bilingual in Arabic and English. He proactively requested that the team member's Target name badge be in both languages, so guests would be aware and able to  
engage with him in a different language. The team  
member also expressed how this simple gesture made him feel proud of his heritage and like he belonged at Target.Leadership of the Future 
Gender and racial/ethnic diversity in the supply chain industry is something Target has been focused on in our own operations.  Knowing this, our global supply chain team created the Target Arrows Camp. It was a two-day experience we hosted for MBA students dedicated to developing logistics talent for the future. It offered a chance for the students to build practical skills through networking, competition and mentorship with experts and other leaders. It also provided a window into the Target Arrows  Leadership Development Program, a three-year program designed to develop future leaders who will solve complex problems and design new and innovative solutions to transform Target’s global supply chain and logistics. � 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportManufacturing Supply Chain

enriching and protecting the people who help create our products, the families they support and the communities where they live and work. We focus our global livelihood efforts on engaging with manufacturing supply chain workers to elevate their well-being. 
We work with strategic partners to help us reach our 
goal of elevating the lives of at least three million people in the factories and communities where our goods are produced. 
We support the livelihoods of workers around the world 
who help make our products through innovative  programs and partnerships. 
• Nest Standards for Homes and Small  
Workshops: Since 2016, we have partnered with 
Nest, a nonprofit focused on developing the global  artisan and handcraft industry to improve the  livelihoods of artisans and home-based workers.  In 2017, we joined Nest and other retailers to draft more than 130 compliance standards for home-based workshops that encompass worker rights and  business transparency, child advocacy and protection, fair compensation and benefits, worker well-being, health and safety and environmental sustainability. • CARE Dignified Work Initiative: In 2017, we began 
our partnership with CARE, an international NGO that addresses economic inclusion and marginalization of women and their communities, to empower female workers in our supply chain located in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam. In 2018, we are expanding upon this work to provide female workers with the enhanced capacity to identify, articulate and advocate for themselves on issues that affect their well-being. 
• Fair Trade Certification: We were among the first 
U.S. retailers to source decorative home goods that were Fair Trade certified through our partnership with Fair Trade USA. In 2017, the first factory that Target nominated for Fair Trade USA certification became certified.
Helping Migrant Workers 
Communicate with Their  Families 
Communication between migrant workers and  
their families is a persistent challenge that is not 
unique to our supply chain, as over 60 million  
children in China are left behind when one or  
more of their parents leaves to find work. In 2018, we engaged with Collective Responsibility, a  
China-based strategic advisory firm and  
innovated with five Chinese universities to create  
a technology solution to help bridge the  
communication gap between migrant workers and their children. Three smart phone app ideas were tested at six Chinese factories where Target’s owned-brand products are made. School and home visits in Sichuan Province validated the potential  
impact of the apps on migrant worker families.  
As a result, a smart phone app is planned for  
development in 2018, which will eventually be  
made available to workers and their families within our supply chain in China.

Providing occupational safety for workers within our 
manufacturing supply chain is a key component of our efforts to improve global livelihoods. Our Standards of Vendor Engagement require that our suppliers provide  a safe and healthy working environment that complies with local laws and minimizes occupational hazards. 
Target was a founding member of the Alliance for 
Bangladesh Worker's Safety in 2013 and continues to engage with the Alliance to elevate safety conditions for garment factory workers across Bangladesh. We use  our seat on the Alliance’s Board of Directors to drive industry-wide change and provide on-the-ground support for factories as they continue to complete the remediation process to adopt the Alliance’s strict safety standards. 
Eliminate Forced Labor
We believe we have a responsibility to protect the  people who help create our products and make every  effort to deliver products to our guests that are made ethically and responsibly. In 2017, we continued to deepen our commitment to identify, and if discovered, work to prevent forced labor in our supply chains, by working to break down the factors that enable forced labor to exist around the world. 
Addressing Forced Labor Risks
We are working alongside our suppliers, global sourcing experts and other key partners to help prevent forced labor in global supply chains. We are utilizing new  technologies, community engagement programs, prevention efforts and more robust standards related to abuses that occur outside the four walls of a factory.
• The Consumer Goods Forum: Our CEO Brian  
Cornell sits on the Board of Directors of The  
Consumer Goods Forum, and we have adopted the organization’s Resolution on Forced Labor. The resolution is the first industry commitment of its kind and includes the adoption of three key principles: that every worker should have freedom of movement, no worker should pay for a job and no worker should be indebted or coerced to work. 
• Verité: We have enlisted Verité to develop policies for 
our suppliers to protect foreign contract workers in our supply chain – seeking to set clear expectations for suppliers and laying out procedures, standards and verification mechanisms that will help support our adoption of the Employer Pays Principle.
• Responsible Business Alliance (RBA): Target 
joined the RBA’s Responsible Labor Initiative’s  Steering Committee in 2017 to continue to develop cross-industry approaches to advancing labor  practices, specifically related to responsible  recruitment and protections for foreign migrant  workers. 
• LaborLink: In 2017, we launched a pilot program  
with Laborlink to aim to prevent human trafficking in Northern India. Workers from eight factories and 10 communities participated in a survey that informed both digital informational messaging and local non-profit partners’ educational programs. By conducting awareness programming prior to migration, we hope this will help address the needs of community  members and may reduce the possibility of trafficking. 
• GoodWeave: All handwoven rugs produced for Target 
in India are certified by GoodWeave as child labor free. In 2017, we continued partnering with GoodWeave to further develop a technology platform that should enable end-to-end supply chain mapping and  monitoring for child labor risks in our supply chain in North India.
• International Justice Mission (IJM): In 2017,  
we entered into a partnership with the International Justice Mission to implement the group’s Safe  Migration Program and Grassroots Prevention  Campaign in India. These programs seek to prevent labor trafficking and support trafficking survivors by engaging with vulnerable communities and local authorities.

we are proud that we were the first major retailer to go public with a list of tier 1 factories in 2014 and the first U.S. retailer to publish our apparel tier 2 wet processing 
Endorsing the WEST  
Principles
We were early endorsers of the Worker  
Engagement Supported by Technology (WEST) Principles and use emerging technology to  
engage workers in our global manufacturing  
supply chains to help mitigate the risks of abuse and exploitation. By signing on, we join other brands, manufacturers and nonprofits in a  
commitment to the following eight principles:
•Starting with integrity and purpose
•Using worker-centric and inclusive design
•Building trust with workers
•Facilitating uptake and ownership
•Managing security and risk
•Analyzing engagement and impact
•Informing decisions and system changes
•Collaborating and sharing learningsfacilities (these include fabric dyeing, printing and  
finishing mills as well as garment laundries) in 2016. 
As part of our efforts to improve transparency and  
visibility into our supply chain, we continue to engage 
and collaborate with external stakeholders and  
benchmarking initiatives. 
In 2017, we were included in the first-ever Corporate 
Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB), which assessed 98 
of the largest publicly-traded companies in the world on 
100 human rights indicators. We received a 30  percent 
score, slightly above average. We are leveraging this 
data to evolve our human rights work and intend to 
use the results of the 2018 CHRB that is scheduled for 
release in November to attempt to improve upon our 
human rights performance moving forward. Read more 
on our current labor and human rights policies here.
Target also participates in the Fashion Transparency 
Index (FTI), a project of nonprofit Fashion Revolution, 
which reviews and ranks 150 of the largest global  
fashion and apparel brands and retailers in the  
categories of Policies & Commitments; Governance; 
Traceability; Know, Show & Fix; and Spotlight Issues. 
FTI assesses how transparent organizations are about 
suppliers, supply chain policies and practices, as well as 
social and environmental impact.�2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportServe Guests
We Deliver Value with Values 
Our guests’ expectations are changing. They want to 
do business with brands that match their values. And they do not want to accept tradeoffs – between what is affordable and what is best for their family, or between performance and the planet. At Target, we have a history of eliminating tradeoffs for our guests. It is at the heart of our brand promise to Expect More. Pay Less. 
Now we are bringing that same thinking to help deliver 
better products and services that meet our guests’ need for both value and values. This starts with raising the bar for what guests can expect from products they buy at Target. For example, it means removing the complexity and guesswork for guests who have told us they find it is extremely confusing to decode which products are better-for-you and/or better-for-the-planet.  
Our owned brands are a key differentiator for Target. 
We are working across our portfolio of owned brands to improve the environmental performance and social impact of each brand. For example, we are identifying opportunities to reduce packaging, eliminate unwanted chemicals, source more sustainable raw materials and leverage the voice of our brands to bring attention to important societal issues such as supporting children with different abilities.
We also want all families to find products that reflect  
their needs at Target. That means trying to make our assortment as inclusive as possible. Our design and  procurement teams help us bring new, innovative  products and brands into our stores that meet the unique needs and preferences of our guests. We have been especially focused on growing our assortment of multicultural toys, beauty and food, as well as inclusive apparel to make our guests feel confident and  empowered to be their most authentic selves. 
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Serve Guests    16To Serve Guests,  
we are focusing on  three key areas:
Better Products
We offer better-for-you and sustainable 
products, services and experiences without compromising convenience, cost or efficacy.
Purposeful Brands
We aim to build positive environmental  and/or social impact into the way we make and market our owned brands.
Inclusive Products & Experiences
We offer products, services and  experiences that bring joy to all families  by meeting diverse needs.
¬ Read more about our goals in this area �2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportWe know our guests care a lot about what is in our  
products, how they are made and where ingredients come from. They trust us to provide them with better products that are responsibly made. We use our size, scale and expertise to create new, better-for-you product choices – like our Simply Balanced grocery brand – and have high standards for product quality and safety. Better Products, Services & Experiences
Better Products 
Our Chemicals Strategy & Policy
Our guests want to know about the chemicals used in their favorite products, and they look to Target for better options for their families. In 2017, to build on our work of offering cleaner, better-for-you product options, we created our chemicals strategy and policy that addresses our entire value chain, operations and every product we sell – a first  in the retail industry. We believe that by supporting our  vendors in being more transparent about the ingredients  in products, we can spur innovation across all our  product categories and operations and help reduce  unwanted chemicals in the homes and lives of millions  of guests.
Our chemicals strategy is an integral part of our  
sustainability commitments and our overarching responsible sourcing aspirations. When our Sustainable Product Index (SPI) was created in 2013, it helped us assess products for healthier living, environmental impact, packaging and  sourcing practices. Now, we use our chemicals strategy as the foundation for formulated essentials. We expect other  initiatives, like our Wellness icons, to build on it.
Target is working to drive transparency, proactive chemicals 
management and innovation across all of our owned- and national-brand consumer products, and operations:• Transparency: We will strive for full visibility to chemicals
contained in or used t
o make the products we sell and
use in our operations.
• Chemicals Management: We will work with business
partners to implement policies, practices and tools thatfacilitate the management of chemicals throughout oursupply chain and across our operations.
• Innovation: We recognize that safer alternatives may
not exist today for some chemicals, therefore we willactively pursue and promote new approaches tochemicals development and the commercialization ofsafer alternatives.
To implement this strategy, we have teamed up with vendors, supply chain partners, nonprofits and other key industry stakeholders to identify unwanted substances in our products and operations, understand how they impact health and the environment and work to develop safer alternatives. Our hope is to bring stakeholders together to champion a consistent, industry-wide approach to greener chemistry. 
Alongside the policy, we have made great strides against 
our first set of chemicals goals aimed at addressing  unwanted chemicals with the biggest potential health  impacts, factoring in their prevalence within our products. 
In our first year of executing our new chemicals strategy, we 
have made progress in the following key areas: 
• Textiles Chemicals Management: We have developed
a Restricted Substance List (RSL) to remove unwanted
chemicals from products and a Manufacturing RestrictedSubstance List (MRSL) aimed at removing unwantedchemicals from our manufacturing processes. For ourMRSL, we adopted the list from Zero Discharge ofHazardous Chemicals (ZDHC), an organization we havealso joined. • Formulated Chemicals Transparency: We track our
pr
ogress on formulated essentials through a system that
helps us handle, store and transport environmentallysensitive items in accordance with local and federal laws.The requirements for suppliers are expanding within thissystem so that we can leverage existing data to betterunderstand our progress toward our chemicals goals inthese categories.
• Alternative Preservatives: We funded and
co-sponsored the Green Chemistry & CommerceCouncil's (GC3) Preservatives Challenge to driveinnovation in the preservatives category. This project isone of the ways in which we are using our investments tohelp advance greener chemistry in beauty and personalcare products and meet our goal to invest up to$5 million in green chemistry innovation by 2022.
We recognize that we are on a journey toward greener chemistry that will sometimes require us to develop new tools along the way. Because the retail landscape is always changing, we will continue to iterate, update and set new chemicals goals as needed, expanding the categories we cover and chemicals addressed.
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Serve Guests    17�2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportWellness Icons
We believe it is important to offer products that help our 
guests support their health and well-being. In 2018, we introduced our Wellness icons as a way to enhance our guests’ ability to make informed purchasing decisions. We have carefully curated our wellness products to try to make them better for our guests, their families and the planet through the minimum requirements of our Wellness Product Standards. If a product meets minimum requirements, the item is eligible to receive icons that highlight information we know is important to our guests, so they can more easily find the type of item they are searching for in our stores and on Target.com.
To receive an icon, a product must meet its category’s  
minimum requirements, which are as follows:
• Essentials & Beauty: Product is formulated without the
following unwanted chemicals: propyl-paraben, butyl- 
paraben, phthalates, formaldehyde, formaldehyde-donorsor nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs). To understand theformulation and the chemicals therein, we also expect fullingredient transparency from our vendors of theseproducts for screening purposes. This means thatgeneric ingredients, like fragrance, must either be naturalor have sub-ingredients listed.
• Food & Beverages: Product is made without synthetic
flavors, colors, preservatives, sweeteners, high-fructosecorn syrup or added trans-fat.
• Supplements & Nutrition: Product is made without
synthetic flavors, colors, sweeteners, high-fructose cornsyrup or hydrogenated oils.

In addition to our owned-brand product  innovations, we are always on the hunt for new better-for-you and better-for-the-planet products that will increase the choices available to our guests.Supporting Innovation for Emerging Brands & 
Creators
Innovation is an important part of our growth. We believe  
in opening our doors to new ideas and concepts, and  encourage innovation that might help us improve our guests’ shopping experience at Target. That is why we  have invested in developing a powerful retail accelerator capability that includes three programs: 
• Target Takeoff: In May 2017, we hosted our first Target
Takeoff – a mini accelerator retail program centered
around supporting emerging businesses that are solvingproblems in areas where we hope to grow our business.We launched Takeoff with the brand theme “better-for-you,” resulting in the launch of food and personal careproducts at Target, including Salty Girl Seafood, asustainable seafood brand and woman-owned business.
• Target + Techstars: For the past two years, we have
partnered with Techstars Retail to implement a three-month intensive startup accelerator focused on bringingnew technology, experiences, products and solutions toretail. We are actively working with 12 past participantstartups, including Inspectorio and Local Crate.
• India-based Accelerator: Launched in 2014, our
Bangalore-based accelerator program focuses onstartups that we hope can bring in transformative ideasacross five key areas: search, content, data, social andmobile.
Our Chemicals Policy in Action
In 2017, we launched our exclusive baby brand, Cloud Island, 
which includes nearly 500 items for expecting families to choose from. Many products in the line, including bedding, changing pads and play mats, are Standard 100 by OEKO-TEX certified, meaning they are tested for and do not contain more than 300 potentially harmful substances.�2018 Corporate Responsibility Report
Inclusive Products &  
Experiences 
We strive to design products that serve a variety of guests 
– regardless of size, body type, skin tone or abilities. Ourintention is to offer products and experiences that reflectthe diverse makeup of our guests.
Inclusive Apparel
Our design agenda includes creating an assortment of adaptive, sensory-friendly and inclusive-sizing apparel. The goal is to make guests feel comfortable and confident when wearing our apparel brands.
• Adaptive: We offer guests more choice in clothing to
meet their needs. Our Cat & Jack adaptive apparel line is
made especially for kids and toddlers living withdisabilities to make it easier for families to dress theirkids in the morning. Our internal design team created 40different items that have unique features such as sideand back snap and zip closures and hidden openings forabdominal access. The line is also made with extra-soft,comfortable and durable cotton knits.
• Sensory-Friendly: For kids with sensory processing
sensitivities, getting dressed can present a challenge forthe whole family. Our design team came up with a limited selection of sensory-friendly pieces for our Cat & Jack children’s clothing brand. The pieces include heat- transferred labels instead of tags, flat seams and one- dimensional graphic tees that aim to minimize discomfort when in contact with skin. 
• Inclusive-Sizing: We introduced an exclusive women’s
lifestyle brand, Universal Thread, which includes anassortment with multiple fits, silhouettes, lengths, risesand sizes. We developed this brand based on interviewswith nearly 1,000 women from around the United Stateswho told us they dreaded shopping for new clothes andthat oftentimes, what they wanted was not offered fortheir body type. Universal Thread offers sizes 00-26W,the most expansive range of sizes ever offered at Target.
Inclusive, Multicultural & Natural Beauty
We offer guests more than 1,000 beauty products that  provide something for different skin tones, skincare needs and hair types. We have been seeing increased interest from our guests in inclusive, multicultural and natural beauty products. That is why in 2018, the theme for our second annual Target Takeoff program is “beauty,” with a focus on startups that emphasize these features in their products.• Inclusive and Multicultural: In 2017, we expanded our
shade r
ange by adding eight new cosmetic brands to
our growing beauty assortment. Designed by a diversegroup of women, the more than 150 new products aredesigned for medium-to-dark skin tones.
• Natural: Our guests are asking for more beauty products
that are made with natural ingredients and fewerunwanted chemicals. In 2017, we began offering FATCO ,
a natural skincare line made with grass-fed tallow. This isin addition to brands we already carry, like Burt’s Bees,Yes To, Pacifica and SW Basics.
Valuing Supplier Diversity
Developing relationships with and expanding opportunities for diverse suppliers not only makes good business sense, but also is central to our support for diversity and inclusion across the enterprise. Partnering with underrepresented businesses helps to improve the shopping experience  for our guests by providing them with a broader selection  of products. In 2017, we worked with over 650 diverse  suppliers
† and increased our spending with diverse suppliers  
by 46 percent over 2016. One of those suppliers includes  Bennett Packaging. Based in Missouri, it is a certified  woman-owned company that we have selected to package our Cat & Jack Baby Outfit Box subscription boxes. 
 † To be considered a diverse-owned company at Target, a supplier must  
be headquartered in the United States and 51 percent owned, operated   
and controlled by one of the following: an ethnic minority, woman, veteran  or LGBT individual.Showing Our Appreciation  
for Veterans
At Target, we want to meet the needs of all our 
guests, including veterans, active military and their family members. To show our deep appreciation for the men and women in uniform, this past Veterans Day, we offered a 10 percent military discount from November 7-11 in all our stores and online.

We Accelerate Economic  
Development
We have always been deeply connected to the  
communities we are lucky enough to call home. By  investing in the places where we live and work, we  create more sustainable communities for future  generations of guests and team members.
Now we want to go further, becoming intentional about 
how our business can accelerate economic development and bring communities together.
As we look to bring the Target brand to neighborhoods 
where our presence and investment can foster  economic vitality – and, of course, joy – this priority is already influencing how we design and locate our stores and distribution centers. We are finding, for instance, that when we tailor our stores to serve local needs, our business performs better. 
This new approach means looking at communities that 
are new for Target, especially in traditionally underserved areas, and thinking about the role our business and  philanthropic support can play. We also want to sendan important message to our nonprofit and communitypartners that we are open to testing and learning howwe can best adapt ourselves to their needs and become good neighbors to them. 
We are just at the beginning, but we are committed that 
by 2025, we will have made a transformative economic impact in priority underserved communities.

Our business depends on the strength, resiliency and 
vibrancy of the communities where we operate. We engage our team members, guests and communities in our efforts to accelerate economic development, create spaces that meet our communities’ expectations and enable our  positive impact to be felt far beyond the walls of our stores. 
Local Engagement
Engaging our Teams
Every year since 2014, Target volunteers have contributed more than 1 million hours of volunteer service in the  communities where we do business. In 2017, we  surpassed our annual volunteer commitment with over  1 million volunteer hours. Our team members tracked nearly 6,000 environmentally focused hours just during Earth Month, on projects to keep their communities vibrant and more resilient. Our team members also frequently jump in during disaster recovery to complement the other efforts we support.
Engaging our Guests 
In April 2018, we started piloting Target Red, a free loyalty program that allows guests to earn exclusive benefits, with our first test market in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. A unique benefit of the Target Red program is that guests accrue votes they can cast to help direct Target’s local  community donation efforts. Target supports local and nationally recognized nonprofit organizations, giving guests a choice among various causes. Target then makes  charitable donations to eligible nonprofit organizations based on votes submitted by Target Red users.When developing Target Red,  
we went straight to our guests to  
better understand what would be 
most meaningful to them in a  
loyalty program. That's what they'll 
see reflected in this test – a free and 
easy way to be rewarded simply for  
shopping at Target. On top of the 
shopping benefits, the program also 
aims to create a more personalized 
experience for our guests, like giving 
them a chance to help direct our  
community giving in their own  
backyard.

One area ofemphasis is in North Minneapolis, where we areworking with local partners to maximize opportunitiesfor the community and increase racial equity in areassuch as housing, education and wealth.
• In 2017, we established a new partnership with
Twin Cities R!SE (TCR), a nonprofit dedicated totransforming lives out of poverty through stableemployment. Offering work skills training,internship opportunities, job search assistanceand employment placement services, TCRcoaches provide one-on-one support andpartners with participants for a year after theyhave landed employment.

In 2017, weworked with agencies to host over 275 events in ourstores across the United States, impacting more than15,000 underserved kids and their families.
Welcoming Spaces &  
Community Opportunity
When we are identifying new store locations, feedback 
and relationship building matters. We conduct guest  research and proactively seek out community input to look for ways to co-create with the neighborhood.
The Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn is a  
high-density, urban community home to young, diverse  families. As we prepared to open the doors of our  Target small-format store in Bensonhurst in October 2017, we saw a big opportunity to use our space to welcome and engage community members. We looked to several local organizations, businesses and elected officials to help us understand the unique needs of the neighborhood. With their partnership and guidance, we took several steps to support a successful opening and sustained success in the Bensonhurst community: 
• We restored parts of the historical theater that was
once located at our new address, repairing its
ornamental ceiling, chandeliers, balcony and seatingarea and delighting residents who remembered thespace in its former use.
• We piloted a community space for guests and their
families to use for informal gatherings and in-storeexperiences.
This approach, and the positive community reception, is already informing where we locate new stores and how we create welcoming and more joyful experiences for our team members and guests.

Disaster Support
When disasters occur, we look to partner with local 
organizations to help those in need and protect our team members and guests. We take care of our impacted team members and their families by helping them get needed resources and providing financial support to help our  communities get back on their feet. 
In response to Hurricane Harvey’s impact on the Gulf 
Coast, Target pledged up to $3.5 million to help  impacted team members and local and national  disaster relief organizations in relief and recovery efforts. The donation benefitted the American Red Cross and  The Salvation Army, to help enable them to provide shelter, food and bulk supplies of essentials to the community.  We donated four trailers of food from our food distribution  center in Denton, Texas, to Feeding America and  The Salvation Army to support the Houston and Dallas  Food Banks. And our teams pitched in to care for their communities in a big way – from volunteering in the  rescue efforts to working around-the-clock to reopen closed stores and keep much-needed supplies on our shelves. Team members from across Texas even  bussed into Houston to pitch in and cover shifts. At our headquarters, we packed 6,000 meals that we shipped directly to Houston and distributed to hurricane victims.
And as communities across Florida and the southeastern 
United States began to pick up the pieces after Hurricane Irma’s devastating impact, Target committed up to  $1 million in cash and in-kind donations to help with  relief and recovery efforts, including 16 trailers of goods. Funds were directed to local and national disaster relief  organizations, including the American Red Cross,  The Salvation Army and Habitat for Humanity to help rebuild homes across the southeast and $50,000 in local store GiftCard support to local nonprofits to supply multiple  shelter operations with baby supplies, water, batteries, personal care products, blankets and more. Here’s a snapshot of our additional efforts:  
• California Wildfires (October 2017): We
donated $150,000 in cash and in-kind supportto aid response and recovery efforts, includingGiftCards for our stores to distribute to localcommunity organizations, food donations andadditional cash and product donations to localorganizations.
• Hurricane Maria (September 2017): We
donated $100,000 in cash and products to aidresidents of Puerto Rico impacted by HurricaneMaria. The support included cash grants andin-kind product donations to local and nationalnonprofit partners including Save The Childrento aid recovery efforts. We also worked to getproducts such as food, water, baby supplies,toiletries, cleaning supplies and more to impactedresidents.
• Helping Communities Respond to Crises:
Following mass shootings in Las Vegas andParkland, Florida, our local stores providedin-kind support in the form of snacks andbeverages to various grieving centers andlocations holding blood drives. In Parkland, wealso provided over 100 backpacks with suppliesto replace those that were taken as part of theshooting investigation.
To me, volunteering means giving of myself in order to make a change in a  
community or in someone's life. Seeing the impact of the volunteering that 
Target has done in various communities gives me a sense of pride in the  
company I work for.

Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Foster Communities    23� 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportDesign Tomorrow
We Embrace  
Future Forward Design
We believe operating a sustainable business and using 
resources responsibly will allow us to serve our guests for many generations to come. Recognizing that we all have a role to play in combating the impacts of climate change, we have developed science-based climate goals that should help us build a resilient business and contribute to a thriving environment.
Our aspiration to develop a comprehensive circular 
strategy builds on extensive work to date to address the environmental impacts of our business, including our efforts to reduce waste, invest in renewable energy and pursue sustainable water management. We will continue to deliver progress on our greenhouse gas (GHG), water and waste goals and see our work in circular as closely aligned with these current and future ambitions.
The circular economy is one of the biggest  
opportunities we have to design a sustainable future.  As a brand with a heritage in democratizing design, we are working to become the retailer that takes circular  mainstream. We want to be the mass retailer that offers the greatest number of products, services and  experiences that are circular by design, incorporating this concept into our owned brands and working with recycled and sustainably sourced materials. 
We are also working to design an experience that is  
better for our guests today and enables us to partner with them to leave the world better for future families. Over the long term, we want to make circular behaviors easy, fun and aspirational for our guests. It starts with taking back products guests no longer need – and do not quite know how to dispose of – such as used car seats and plastic bags.
Beyond circular, designing tomorrow also means  
ensuring our operations are sustainable – from  packaging considerations to store design. 
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Design Tomorrow    24To Design Tomorrow,  
we are focusing on  three key areas:
Responsible Resource Use
We aim to source and influence our  
suppliers to manufacture environmentally and socially responsible products. 
Circular Behavior & Innovation
We seek to establish a culture and  mindset around circular design and zero waste lifestyles.
Sustainable Operations
We aspire to design and operate the most  sustainable buildings in the retail industry. 
¬ Read more about our goals in this area �2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportClimate and Energy 
To combat the impacts of climate change and run our 
business more sustainably, we are aiming to reduce our GHG emissions and increase the energy efficiency of  our operations.
Climate Policy
In 2017, we introduced a new climate policy and goals to guide our progress, based on the latest climate science. We have set goals to reduce our greenhouse gas  footprint, and continue to work with our industry  partners, policymakers and other stakeholders to  accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.
While we are implementing projects in our owned- 
brand manufacturing facilities that will result in the avoidance of Scope 3 emissions, within the year, we aim to develop an additional Scope 3 goal that, coupled with our Scope 1 and 2 goals, will fulfill our commitment to the Science-Based Targets initiative. This initiative provides guidance for and champions science-based target setting as a powerful way of boosting companies’ competitive advantage in the transition to the low-carbon economy. These new goals build on our 2020 commitments to improve energy efficiency, drive investments in renewable energy and lower our overall hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) impact.
Target has long been committed to making our business more sustainable, 
which leads to a stronger, cleaner supply chain and operations and a healthier 
environment for our team members and guests. That is why we set goals to 
reduce our greenhouse gas footprint and are working with industry partners, 
policymakers and other stakeholders to accelerate the transition to a  
low-carbon economy.

Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Design Tomorrow    25� 2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportSustainable  
Operations
We aim to build and remodel intentional 
spaces that are designed with our long-term impact on the environment in mind. 
Resource Efficient Buildings
• ENERGY STAR: We continue to 
pursue ENERGY STAR certification of our U.S. buildings and met our goal of achieving this designation in 80 percentof our buildings by 2020. In 2017, we received ENERGY STAR certifications for an additional 106 stores and two headquarters buildings, bringing our total certifications to 1,509 stores, four headquarters buildings and two data centers. 
• Electric Vehicles Program: We are 
making advances in our electric vehicle infrastructure with the help of industry experts Tesla, ChargePoint and ElectrifyAmerica. Our current electric vehicle program spans 18 sites in five states, and we plan to expand our electric vehicle program over the next two years to more than 600 parking spaces at over 100 sites across more than 20 states with charging stations. 
• Natural Refrigerants: Another way 
we are eliminating GHG emissions and saving energy is through the use of HFC-free refrigerants in our food distribution centers and stand-alone refrigerated display cases. All five of ourFood Distribution Centers use HFC-free refrigerants for cold storage areas, and more than a thousand stores have HFC-free refrigerants in stand-alone cases. We continue to be an active member of the GreenChill Partnership, a partnership with the EPA to help reduce refrigerant emissions.   
• Smart Building Innovation Lab: In 
2017, we opened our Smart Building Innovation Lab to drive sustainable value for our guests and team  members through networked,  controlled and intelligent assets.  The lab focuses on smart building innovation with various mock systems for training, testing and discussion on 
 creating smarter building controls,  electrical, plumbing and lighting  systems. 
Renewable Energy
We are working toward sourcing  100 percent renewable energy in our  domestic operations, as well as  increasing the use of renewables in  communities where our facilities and  distribution centers are located and in  
 our supply chain. As a member of the  Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), Target and other organizations help promote and develop new  renewable energy opportunities.
• Offsite & Utility Efforts: In pursuit of 
our commitment to source 100 percent 
renewable and to expand investment in offsite renewable energy to comple-ment onsite renewables, we signed a Virtual Power Purchase agreement in 2016 with Stephen’s Ranch Wind Farm in Texas. The farm provides us 40 MW, 
 which is capable of generating clean energy for approximately 60 stores on an annual basis. In 2017, Target signed a new 100 MW wind deal in Kansas that will have the potential to offset additional usage once construction is complete in 2019. Target also recently announced its participation in green tariffs with two utilities, Puget Sound Energy and  Georgia Power . The Georgia Power  
tariff is a new initiative Target joined, along with several other Fortune 50 companies, which will leverage a total of 177 MW of new solar power to help meet corporate customers’ energy needs.
• Onsite Solar: Growing our solar  
program is a big priority for us. In 2017, we added more than 40 MW of solar, increasing our total solar capacity to over 204 MW. In some cases, Target may generate the solar energy in support of utility and state clean energy programs and policies. In those instances, we do not retain the renewable energy credits. Onsite, we are well on our way toward our goal of 500 buildings with rooftop solar panels by 2020, with more than 436 projects completed at the end of fiscal year 2017. 
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Design Tomorrow    26
At Target, we are  
designing for tomorrow 
and putting solutions in 
place across our business 
to leave our homes better 
for future families. And we 
are proud of the progress 
our team has made over 
the past year toward  
Target’s goal to install  
rooftop solar panels on 
500 buildings by 2020.  
As we continue our  
commitment to supporting our local communities, it is 
an incredible honor to be 
recognized by SEIA (Solar 
Energy Industries  
Association) for the  
second year in a row. 
- John L  eisen, Vice President,  
Property Management, Target�2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportDeforestation
As a retailer with a wide variety of products, we understand 
the responsibility we have to protect forests around the world. We are committed to aiding in the global effort to end deforestation and forest degradation, and focus our efforts in the places we can have the most positive impact today— specifically palm oil and wood-based materials.  
We are committed to sustainably sourcing palm, wood, 
paper and wood-based fibers in our priority owned brands, and wood-based fibers in packaging. We will build on our existing priority raw material commitments by evaluating high-risk commodities—including soy, leather and rubber— and their material significance to Target. Where necessary, we will address salient issues with relevant time-bound and measurable goals.
Furthermore, Target recognizes that forests are not the  
only ecosystem under threat from commodity production. We are currently undertaking efforts to identify how and where conversion of other types of natural habitat, like grasslands and savannahs, touches our supply chain, such as our domestic beef supply chain. We have joined the  U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef as a way to advance sustainability efforts in the domestic supply chain.
Read more about our work to end deforestation within our 
supply chain on our Corporate Site.
Forests 
We support responsibly managed forests, and to that end, introduced our new Responsible Sourcing Policy on Forest Products in 2017. This policy helps us toward our long-termintention that all wood, paper, paper-based packaging and wood-based fiber used in the products we purchase and sell is sourced from well-managed forests that have been credibly certified and/or are from post-consumer recycled materials.We are starting with products containing wood or  paper-based materials, like tissues and paper towels,  wrapping paper, furniture and rayon used in apparel,  which comes from wood pulp. Then we plan to work on sourcing our owned-brands’ packaging from sustainably managed forests. 
By the end of fiscal year 2018, we expect that our party 
supplies brand, Spritz, will be our first owned brand to be fully compliant with our forest products policy. In 2017, the Spritz team started introducing Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Chain-of-Custody certification and is on track to meet this goal. We have also committed to making our up&up, Pillowfort and Cat & Jack brands fully compliant with  our forest products policy by 2020, and Threshold and Smith & Hawken fully compliant by 2022.
Palm Oil 
We continue to work closely with our owned-brand  vendor base to emphasize that in 2018, all palm oil in  our owned-brand food (Market Pantry, Archer Farms, Simply Balanced), personal care (up&up) and household cleaning products (up&up) is required to be fully traceable and sustainably sourced. In 2017, 37.4 percent of palm oil in products covered by our commitment was certified sustainable via physical certification (Mass Balance or  Segregated) or covered by PalmTrace credits. 
Target continues to engage its vendors on the  
implementation of Target’s responsible palm oil sourcing commitment through a biannual survey to determine the volume of palm oil and palm kernel oil used in the owned-
 brand products covered by its commitment, includingthe percentage that is certified as sustainable, classified across PalmTrace Credits, Mass Balance and Segregated. Our commitment covers palm volumes purchased directly by our vendors for use in products, vendors that source palm oil indirectly through finished product components and vendors that source palm oil and kernel derivatives in household and personal care products.In 2017, Target:
• Continued collecting and validating volume and
traceability data from all vendors, including supplier
engagement and active follow-up, with our partner,Proforest;
• Engaged with key importers into the U.S. market on
traceability;
• Engaged critical vendors regarding their path toward
Target policy compliance;
• Supported vendors/suppliers on process to deliver
certified products;
• Shared tools, training materials and guidance documents
to aid commitment implementation; and
• Joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil’s North
American Sustainable Palm Oil Network, designed tofacilitate cross-sector work in a pre-competitive space onthe sourcing of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) inNorth America, foster collaboration and impact programsin producing nations and share best practices.
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Design Tomorrow    27
�2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportRaw Materials 
From the moment natural resources  
are sourced, to how they are transformed into the products our guests love, we strive for transparency, quality and safety. As part of that commitment, we aim to  do our part to source raw materials in a way that helps protect the planet and  supports the communities that source them. In addition to our existing policies for sourcing sustainable palm oil,  paper-based packaging and forest  products, we also have a policy for cotton. 
Cotton
Cotton (both virgin and recycled) is vital  to our business as a staple raw  material found in many of our owned-brand products and the brands that we carry in our stores. Cotton farming is  critical to the economic well-being of many of our sourcing communities around the world, and growing it can be resource intensive. We are focused on leveraging our scale to drive positive change within the cotton industry by championing responsibly grown and  harvested cotton used in our owned-brand products. 
Target is committed to sourcing 100 
percent sustainable cotton for our owned-brand and exclusive national brand products by 2022. We are using a combination of programs that promote, measure and provide education around sustainable cotton production that best suit the varied geographies, supply chains and practices that Target relies upon.  For example, in 2017 Target became  a member of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI). To date, we have sourced the equivalent of nearly 7.4 million pairs of jeans of Better Cotton. We also continue to work internally and with our vendors to incorporate sustainably sourced cotton. Read more about our long-term cotton transparency aspiration, continuous improvement efforts and our definition of sustainable cotton on our Corporate Site.
Recycled Raw Materials 
As part of our focus on circular design, we are always looking for new and  innovative ways to use recycled raw  materials in our owned-brand products and do so as often as possible. 
We established a new goal in 2016 to re-
place all conventional polyester with poly-ester made from recycled plastic in Target owned-brand apparel, accessories and home products. For instance, Cat & Jack uses Repreve recycled polyester in its swimwear, graphic tees, newborn body-suits, basic tees and tanks and more. In 2017, our recycled polyester programs in Apparel and Accessories, Home and Hardlines products used more than 36 million pounds of recycled polyester. 
Animal Welfare 
We believe that every animal deserves  to be free from hunger and thirst,  discomfort, pain, injury or disease, fear and distress, and is free to express normal behavior throughout an animal’s entire lifetime. We do not support the  use of routine, non-therapeutic  antimicrobials – including all antibiotics – to promote growth. We expect our  suppliers and the producers they work with to phase out this practice and only use antimicrobials when medically  necessary. 
Our Food Animal Welfare & Antibiotics 
Policies outline the standards and  principles that we expect our Meat,  Dairy and Deli vendors to follow when sourcing and producing products for  sale at Target. 
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Design Tomorrow    28Sustainable Seafood
In 2017, we achieved 100 percent sustainable fresh and frozen seafood at Target and released an updated  Sustainable Seafood Policy, committing to more traceability and sustainable shelf-stable tuna, as well as sushi. 
Supplier  
Transparency:  Environmental Focus 
We source Target-brand products  
from more than 2,700 registered 
manufacturing facilities in more than 49 countries, all of which we require to uphold our Standards of Vendor  Engagement (SOVE). These standards outline how we expect our vendors to be good environmental stewards. Our SOVE include six foundations of  
environmental oversight for vendors  
and their manufacturing supply chains:  
environmental management and  
monitoring systems; water stewardship; waste reduction and disposal; energy management; emissions to air; and environmental licenses and permitting.Target has No Tolerance standards for wastewater and environmental permits.
Increasing transparency within our  
supply chain helps us monitor  
whether our business partners are  
conducting their production practices 
in an environmentally sustainable way. Target is committed to increased supply chain transparency. View our global factory list here. �2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportWater
We believe clean, drinkable water and sanitation are 
human rights and should be accessible for all. Healthy ecosystems and sustainable water management are essential in the delivery of these basic rights. 
Target recently joined the Zero Discharge of Hazardous 
Chemicals (ZDHC) organization, and plans to use its wastewater guidelines for our 2025 manufacturing goal for water. The guidelines were designed to help compa-nies reduce unwanted chemicals in manufacturing and prevent them from being discharged in wastewater and impacting surrounding communities.
We will continue water conservation work that is already 
in progress too, like our recent efforts with Conserva Irrigation to optimize the outdoor irrigation systems at our stores. This has already saved more than 36 million gallons of water and should be in place at more than 300 stores by the end of 2018.
In 2017, we collaborated with World Wildlife Fund  
(WWF) on a water risk assessment of our water  reduction efforts across our supply chain, stores and distribution centers. As a result, in early 2018 we  announced a holistic approach to freshwater  stewardship that acknowledges water as part of a bigger global system linked to other megatrends such as  climate change, rapid urbanization and population growth. Our actions are intended to contribute to im-proved water quality, quantity and access through  a focus on:
• Raw Materials: We know that our water footprint
starts with growing the raw materials needed to
produce our products, and we are working to betterunderstand our basin-level impacts to prioritize ourresponses.
• Manufacturing: Working in our areas of greatest im-
pact, we plan to do more with less water – especiallywhere local conditions demand. Looking across ourproduct supply chains, we want wastewater leavingour vendor’s facilities to be of quality that could besafely used as drinking water. Since 2012, we havepartnered with the Natural Resources Defense Council(NRDC) to implement Clean by Design, a program to reduce the environmental footprint of textile mills. To date, we have improved water efficiency with our suppliers by over 3 billion liters of water. In 2017, we became a strategic partner of the Apparel Impact Institute, a collaboration of brands, manufacturers and industry associations that have come together to  select, fund and scale projects such as Clean by Design more quickly.
When it comes to our owned brands, our  
Universal Thread jeggings are finished using Kitotex,  a technology that uses Chitosan in the dyeing  process to help reduce water, chemicals and energy consumption.
• Direct Operations: Across our stores, distribution
centers and headquarters locations we are takingaction to reduce water scarcity, support water qualitycompliance and address storm water flows. Havingaccomplished our 10 percent per square foot waterreduction goal in stores four years early, weannounced a new goal for 2025 to reduce our annualwater consumption by over 500 million gallons. Ournew water usage goal is a 15 percent absolutereduction from our 2010 baseline usage in stores,distribution centers and headquarters locations. Ourabsolute water use reduction goal encompasses allareas of our direct operations. The change in the goalboundaries and metrics reflects the continuingimportance of water conservation initiatives in ourdirect operations, throughout the entire business andin the communities we serve. We have already seena 9.9 percent absolute reduction in water usage infiscal year 2017, which included 53 weeks insteadof the typical 52 weeks in a year. In 2017, irrigationsmart controllers and optimized irrigation systems at170 stores located in markets with the greatest waterrisks saved over 36 million gallons in water. We planto scale this irrigation efficiency program to morethan 300 stores in 2018. In addition, over the next 24months, we will seek to understand our position onwater quality within our U.S. building operations.

Since 2016, we have partnered with International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) to create the Vietnam Improvement Program (VIP), which aims to promote a green, environmentally-efficient manufacturing supply chain in Vietnam, focused on footwear and apparel garment factories, as well as tier 2 wet processing factories. In 2017, 10 of our vendors’ factories realized over 1 million cubic meters of  
water savings and 130 million kWh of energy  
savings per year. Investments to achieve these  
savings pay for themselves in less than five months.  �2018 Corporate Responsibility Report

• In 2017, Target volunteers dedicated over 1,000
hours to clean up waterways, beaches andwatershed areas, diverting thousands of poundsof trash from our water sources and plantingnative material that helps to further protect thesewaterways.
Waste
At Target, we are working to develop a holistic approach to circularity across our business and value chain. That means designing our products and supply chain in ways that recycle materials in a waste-free loop, and helping our guests live that way too. We have invested in initiatives to help us test, learn and move forward to establish a culture and mindset of zero-waste living and circular design. 
Circular Behavior  
& Innovation
We are aiming to make the circular economy the norm for 
our industry and incorporating circular design discipline in our product innovation. For instance, our Universal Thread brand has incorporated sustainable materials and circular design into a number of product elements, including the use of recycled cotton in select styles and Repreve polyester made from recycled plastic bottles in a portion of the jeans.
As fashion trends come and go, the average American 
throws an estimated 70 pounds of unwanted clothing into landfills each year. The country’s leading fashion players, including Target, are teaming up to tackle this important issue. In 2017, we became a strategic partner to the Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), supporting efforts to change the way fashion is produced and consumed. As part of our work with GFA, we have also committed to the following: 
• Textile innovation: By 2020, we will invest US
$1 million in textile recycling technologies, with the goal of
accelerating the transition to a circular apparel industry.
• Durability: By 2020, all Target owned-brand apparel will
be designed for functional durability to last the life cycle
†
of the product.
W
e also have joined Fashion for Good (FFG), a global  
initiative with a mission to support needed systemic  changes in the fashion industry by fostering impactful  innovations and acting as a convener for change. 
†As part of our commitment to quality, all our owned-brand general 
merchandise has a one-year return policy – a promise to guests 
that we do not compromise quality to sell products at a value.

Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Design Tomorrow    30�2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportSustainable Packaging 
We strive for continuous improvement of the sustainability 
of our packaging. In 2017, we updated our sustainable packaging goals to reflect our guests’ expectations for  environmentally responsible packaging, support our  business priorities, address industry-wide challenges and focus in areas where we can drive the most change:
• We are working closely with our suppliers and other
partners to eliminate expanded polystyrene, foam
packaging that is difficult to recycle.
• We are working with our vendors to understand the origin
of raw materials that go into our paper-based packagingto source from sustainably managed forests, starting withour owned-brand products.
• As part of our work with the Sustainable Packaging
Coalition, we are continuing to look for ways to add theHow2Recycle label to our owned-brand productpackages. The label is an industry standard that letsconsumers know exactly how to recycle a particularpiece of packaging, and we are already compliant,where space allows, with more than 3,800 owned-brandproduct food packages.
• As the first retailer to join The Recycling Partnership, we
are investing to increase access to curbside recycling incommunities.• We have joined industry efforts to create more demand
for r
ecycled packaging. This includes the Materials
Recovery for the Future Collaborative, a project workingtoward a vision that all flexible packaging can be recycled.
We are especially concerned with the limited availability of recycling options for expanded polystyrene for our guests and distribution centers. As a contributor to plastic pollution on land and in waterways, we understand the challenges foam creates as a common plastic pollutant; yet as an  inexpensive, effective and broadly available packaging material, finding acceptable replacements to expanded polystyrene is a challenge that will take time. 
Currently, we are identifying the presence of foam  
packaging used across the enterprise and developing  solutions to shift away from it by testing alternatives with  the hope of making the best decision for both guests and Target. We are also partnering with vendors and industry peers to find acceptable, more environmentally sustainable replacements that do not create unacceptable cost or  performance trade-offs.
We continue to engage with industry organizations like the 
New Plastics Economy and our peers to address common challenges and achieve a zero-waste world. As an  Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) Recycling Demand Champion, we are working to play a prominent role in expanding the market for mixed residential plastics, driving investment, increasing demand and producing more high-quality post-consumer recycled plastic.Recycling and Trade-in Programs
We believe if we can make it easier for our guests to  recycle, we can collectively scale our impact. In 2017, we built on the success of existing programs and began development of new ones. Here are just a few examples of ways we are innovating to bring more recycling options to our guests: 
• Recycling Used Car Seats: Our guests often tell us
they are looking for sustainable ways to dispose of their
old, outgrown car seats. Unfortunately, there are somebig obstacles preventing car seats from being easilyrecycled, including safety concerns and lack of eligibilityfor most curbside recycling programs. In 2016, we invitedguests to bring used seats to their local Target storeand get a great deal on a new one. Since then, we havecollected more than 170,000 car seats and our vendorpartner, TerraCycle, recycled them into new products,diverting 2.6 million pounds of materials from landfills.
• Denim Trade-in: Textiles are another hard-to-recycle
item that we are exploring. A new trade-in program wetested in March 2018 allowed guests to convenientlydrop off used denim. We teamed up with I:CO(I:Collect), an organization that gathers and recycles orreuses unwanted clothing, to implement this program.More than 180 stores across the Pacific Northwest,Mountain and Gulf Coast regions participated in the initialtest. The denim collected will likely be used secondhandor recycled into products like cleaning cloths, carpetpadding or yarn for new clothing.
Reducing Plastic Hangers
We use approximately 500 million plastic clothing hangers in our stores every year. To reduce waste, we have had a sustainable 
closed-loop hanger reuse program in operation since 1994. This program reused enough hangers in 2017 to circle the globe  
4.6 times and saves us $17.5 million each year versus buying new ones.  
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Design Tomorrow    31In 2017, our electronics  
recycling program recycled more than 4.2 million pounds of electronics.�2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportOperational Resource Recovery
In 2017, we diverted 74 percent of our retail waste from 
landfills through salvage, donations, organics, reuse or recycling, surpassing our goal of 70 percent diversion by 2020. Now we have our sights set on 75 percent  diversion by 2018. Our progress is a result of the  Salvage and Waste teams’ efforts in managing the  salvage, donation, organics, recycling and trash  programs for U.S. headquarters, distribution centers  and Target stores. 
• Food Waste: Managing food waste is an important
part of our overall waste diversion strategy. In the
United States, 40 percent of food produced goesuneaten, and reducing food waste by 15 percentcould feed 25 million people every year. In 2017,as part of our food waste prevention strategy, wedonated more than 76 million pounds of food (64million meals) through our partnership with FeedingAmerica, with stores donating fresh and packagedfoods to local food banks and other organizations.
In August, we committed $1.3 million to support the
establishment of seven Feeding America RegionalProduce Cooperatives to increase the amount ofproduce available for distribution, while also reducingwasted food. In 2018, we are continuing to deliverdonations reporting at the store level to drive strongerparticipation, and look to expand the scope ofdonatable items.
In 2017, we performed waste stream audits to
understand what is being sent to landfills. Stores wereselected based on store type, volume, geographyand trash volumes to obtain a representative sampleof our full supply chain. Waste audits consisted of 14stores, two regional distribution centers and one fooddistribution center. We plan to audit locations on anongoing basis to measure progress in line with ourwaste minimization goals. We will use the data fromthese audits, along with other data points, to enhancereporting to drive execution of our programs.Tracking trash, donations, recycling and organics  programs at the store level continues to be a focus  for us in driving execution for waste minimization.  In 2017, we launched new reporting to deliver  store-level data for donations which provided more  visibility. This reporting increased the data received  by our donations partners and drove increased  participation rates at stores, which led to a 15 million pound increase compared to 2016 donations. 
In 2017, the results of the waste audits showed us the 
value of conducting audits and the need to establish a consistent waste audit approach. We will take these learnings to drive future strategies and execution. Based on the significant opportunities found in the waste audits, the need for store-level data is a top  priority. With a desire to strive for a zero-waste  mindset, program execution, data and analytics,  innovations to capture donations, organics recycling and other waste programs will need to become  more robust through execution, program awareness, resources and property-level tracking.
As a member of The Consumer Goods Forum, we  
adopted its Food Waste Resolution, committing to halve Target’s food waste within our operations by 2025. We also expect to continually engage experts and consultants in food waste at key moments as we develop our strategy, and seek new partners and programs to reduce food waste going to the landfill.
• Zero-Waste Certification: Target’s Waste
Minimization team recently became zero-wastecertified as TRUE Advisors by the U.S. Green BuildingCouncil. As part of our efforts, we recently launchedcomposting and began tracking waste at ourHighland Park Target store in St. Paul, Minnesotastarting in May 2018. We also hope to certify thisproject location by achieving an average of 90 percentor greater overall diversion from landfill, incinerationand the environment for solid, non-hazardous wastesover a 12-month timeframe.In 2017, we launched an organics recycling 
program at 66 Target store locations. Building upon the learnings from those locations, in 2018, we plan to expand the program to 209 additional stores (including four distribution centers and one food distribution center), totaling 307 Target  
locations. 
In addition, we compost organic waste at our 
corporate headquarters. In 2017, we composted 582,000 pounds of organic waste.
Corporate Responsibility Strategy: Design Tomorrow    32We adopted The Consumer Goods Forum's  
Food Waste Resolution, committing to halve  
Target’s food waste within our operations by 2025.Materiality
Our Approach
We are intentional about taking action on the societal issues that matter most to our 
business and our stakeholders. Conducting a corporate responsibility materiality  assessment helps us to more effectively adapt our strategy, focus our resources and customize our reporting to meet our stakeholders’ expectations. Reporting on our material issues helps us be “in accordance” with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. 
It is important to understand the definition of materiality used for our materiality  
assessment in this report is different than that used for filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Issues deemed material for purposes of this report may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.
Materiality   33�2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportMateriality Process 
Our approach to materiality is not a static process, and 
we are continually working to refine the process to make it more useful. In 2016, we leveraged external research and an internal analysis of the impact of social and environmental issues to our business and the degree of impact/influence we have on those issues.
In 2017, we shared those findings with stakeholders to 
hear their feedback and expectations on the issues that matter most, and how we can most effectively work to address those issues.
• Internal Stakeholders: We worked closely with
internal working groups to realign and prioritize the
environmental and social topics of concern and ourapproach to those topics.• External Stakeholders: We engaged Business for
Social Responsibility
 (BSR) to administer a stakeholder
survey to gauge how we are doing on these issues.Overall, most of our external stakeholders believe thatwe are focused on the right issues and haverecognized Target’s current leadership, and our planto take a future leadership role, on a wide range ofissues.

Progress Against Our Goals: Our Continued Commitments & What’s Next    50About this Report
Scope
This corporate responsibility report updates  
stakeholders on our progress against our corporate responsibility commitments. We are ambitious in our commitments, which means that sometimes there are setbacks. We are open about these challenges and are dedicated to doing what is required to address them.
In addition, our commitments may be altered as our 
business priorities change and corporate responsibility priorities change.
This report represents Target’s global operations for 
fiscal year end 2017. Unless noted, as with our  manufacturing activities abroad, goals and other data within the report reflect our U.S. operations.

We have changed the naming convention of this report 
to reflect the year of publishing (2018) as opposed to our previous reports, which reflected the year that the data represented. As such, there will be no report titled the 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report, as this 2018 Corporate Responsibility Report represents the fiscal year 2017 data.

responsibility matters. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has overall oversight  responsibility over corporate responsibility matters. Target recognizes that environmental, social and governance issues are of increasing importance to many investors. The Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and the Corporate Responsibility team work with functional leaders across the company to determine strategies, policies and goals related to sustainability and regularly report to and seek input from the Nominating and Governance Committee on those matters, including review of the annual Corporate Responsibility Report.

GRI 102 Changes in reporting 102-49 Report Name Change 
We have changed the naming convention of this report to reflect the year of publishing (2018) as opposed to our previous reports, which reflected the year that the data represented. As such, there will be no report titled the 2017 Corporate  Responsibility Report, as this 2018 Corporate Responsibility Report represents the fiscal year 2017 data.
Governance 
The Nominating and Governance Committee’s oversight authority became effective as of June 2018. Thus, all references to the Nominating and Governance Committee within this report apply to Target's new governance structure beginning in June 2018. 
Water Goal Change  
After reaching our goal in 2016 to improve water usage efficiency at stores by 10 percent per sq. ft. from our 2010 baseline, Target has decided to further its commitment to water conservation and sustainability by setting an absolute water use  reduction goal. 
Absolute Water Reduction Goal, p. 47 GRI 409-1: Forced or Compulsory Labor  
In previous years, the data Target supplied in relation to the Forced or Compulsory Labor GRI Disclosures inaccurately  consisted of the total number of Target suppliers that underwent a social compliance audit during the applicable year. As  a consequence, the numbers reported did not accurately represent the number of Target suppliers at “significant risk” for  incidents of forced or compulsory labor (which would have been a small fraction of the total reported) and also did not refer  to the work Target performed that year to identify, address and combat forced labor. Having reassessed the reporting  requirement of GRI disclosure 409-1, which does not require quantitative reporting, our responses in this response and going forward will refer to our qualitative work focused on the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor.

Community 
ServiceManagement Approach  
(103-1, 103-2, 103-3)103 At Target, community service is part of our rich history of investing in our communities. Just as important as our financial  
contributions, is time and talent contributed by our team members across the globe. In 2017, we set a goal and achieved  1 million hours of volunteer service and we have maintained this commitment annually ever since. Each of our locations across  the globe—whether headquarters, a store, a distribution center or global office, contributes to this commitment.  
Our team is encouraged to volunteer where it feels locally relevant, and where they have passion. We continue to encourage  
participation in skills-based/pro bono community service via our Law pro bono work, nonprofit board service program and  skills-based challenge events. 
In 2018, we will provide additional opportunities for team members to help us achieve our 1 million hours commitment of  
service in Target communities.  
Disaster Support
Management Approach  
(103-1, 103-2, 103-3)103 Every disaster is local and with Target stores in more than 1,800 communities, a global supply chain and nearly 350,000 team  
members, disasters often have a direct impact to Target.  
Natural disasters are increasing in frequency and getting larger in size and scale and are therefore, more destructive.  
Additionally, man-made disasters are becoming more frequent as well.  
Target responds to natural disasters around the world in communities where our team members live and work as well as where  
Target has stores, distribution centers, headquarters offices and manufacturing supply chain presence. Donations include a mix  of cash grants, in-kind product and leveraging our resources to build back communities stronger than before. Target responds to man-made disasters by supporting the needs of the community and first-responders on site through in-kind product  donations.  
Target’s Global Crisis Management team provides coordination of local leaders and HQ team members to respond to the needs of 
the team, store and community. Our goal is to keep the Target team safe, allow Target to quickly re-open stores and help the com-munity get back on its feet.  We evaluate each response independently to understand the needs of our team, guests and communi-ties to prepare for the next disaster.

Procurement Practices
Animal 
WelfareManagement Approach  
(103-1, 103-2, 103-3)103 We believe that every animal deserves to be free from hunger and thirst, discomfort, pain, injury or disease, fear and  
distress, and is free to express normal behavior throughout an animal’s entire lifetime. We do not support the use of routine, non-therapeutic antimicrobials – including all antibiotics – to promote growth. We expect our suppliers and the producers  they work with to phase out this practice and only use antimicrobials when medically necessary. Our Food Animal Welfare &  Antibiotics Policies outline the standards and principles that we expect our Meat, Dairy and Deli vendors to follow when  sourcing and producing products for sale at Target.
We are working with our suppliers to increase our offerings of cage-free shell eggs nationwide, working toward a 100 percent 
cage-free shell egg assortment by 2025, based on available supply. We are also partnering closely with our pork product vendors to eliminate the use of sow gestation crates by 2022. We monitor our suppliers annually to confirm adherence to our standards.

•Invest up to $5 million in green chemistry innovation by 2022
Our guests want to know about the chemicals used to make their favorite products, and they look to Target for better options for their families. In January 2017, we launched a new strategy, including a chemicals policy and goals, to help us manage chemicals across our assortment and operations. We believe that by supporting our vendors in being more transparent about the ingredients in products, we can spur innovation across all of our product categories and operations, and help reduce unwanted substances from the homes and workplaces of millions of guests.
We are continuing to report on the progress to goals where we have available data, and to establish baselines in the cases 
where we do not currently have data available. Throughout 2018, we will continue to scope out other potential goals and options for including additional operations and product categories under Target's Chemicals Policy.

(103-1, 103-2, 103-3)103 Goal:
•Support responsibly managed forests and palm oil production
As a retailer with a wide variety of products, we understand the responsibility we have to protect forests around the world. We are committed to aiding in the global effort to end deforestation and forest degradation, and focus our efforts in the places we can have the most positive impact today – specifically palm oil and wood-based materials.  
We are committed to sustainably sourcing palm, wood, paper, and wood-based fibers in our priority owned brands, and 
wood-based fibers in packaging. We will build on our existing priority raw material commitments by evaluating high-risk commodities – including soy, leather and rubber – and their material significance to Target. Where necessary, we will address salient issues with relevant time-bound and measurable goals.
Furthermore, Target recognizes that forests are not the only ecosystem under threat from commodity production. We are  
currently undertaking efforts to identify how and where conversion of other types of natural habitat, like grasslands and  savannahs, touches our supply chain, such as our domestic beef supply chain. We have joined the U.S. Roundtable for  Sustainable Beef as a way to advance sustainability efforts in the domestic supply chain.

(103-1, 103-2, 103-3)103 Goal:
•All palm oil in Target’s owned-brand food, personal care and household cleaning products will be fully traceable andsustainably sourced by 2018 or sooner
We continue to work closely with our owned-brand vendor base to meet our goal. In 2017, 37.4 percent of palm oil in  products covered by our commitment was certified sustainable via physical certification (Mass Balance or Segregated) or covered by PalmTrace credits.  
Target continues to engage its vendors on the implementation of Target’s responsible palm oil sourcing commitment through 
a biannual survey to determine the volume of palm oil and palm kernel oil used in the owned-brand products covered by its commitment, including the percentage that is certified as sustainable, classified across PalmTrace Credits, Mass Balance and Segregated. Our commitment covers palm volumes purchased directly by our vendors for use in products, vendors that source palm oil indirectly through finished product components and vendors that source palm oil and kernel derivatives in household and personal care products.
In 2017, Target:
• Continued collecting and validating volume and traceability data from all vendors, including supplier engagement and active
follow-up, with our partner, Proforest;
• Engaged with key importers into the U.S. market on traceability;• Engaged critical vendors regarding their path toward Target policy compliance;• Supported vendors/suppliers on process to deliver certified products;• Shared tools, training materials and guidance documents to aid commitment implementation; and• Joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil’s North American Sustainable Palm Oil Network, designed to facilitate
cross-sector work in a pre-competitive space on the sourcing of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) in North America,foster collaboration and impact programs in producing nations and share best practices.

Water  Stewardship & Management
Management Approach  
(103-1, 103-2, 103-3)103 Goals: 
•Drive sustainable water stewardship in Target owned-brand product design and manufacturing
•By 2025, absolute water reduction by 15 percent in stores, distribution centers and headquarters locations
We believe clean, drinkable water and sanitation are human rights and should be accessible for all. Healthy ecosystems and sustainable water management are essential in the delivery of these basic rights.
Water is important to the success of our business operations, from our supply chains to our stores and the communities within 
which we operate. We will focus our freshwater stewardship efforts in areas and on issues where our influence and support can help deliver the greatest impact. We used World Wildlife Fund’s (WWF) water risk assessment to review our water use reduction efforts across our manufacturing supply chain, stores and distribution facilities. This helped us develop a holistic  approach that acknowledges water as part of a bigger global system of megatrends. Our plan is ambitious, so we will focus our efforts in four main areas (Raw Materials; Manufacturing; Direct Operations; and Beyond the Fenceline) where we can make the greatest impact, with initial goals to guide our progress. 
Our initial goals are meant to impact three primary outcomes: improving water quality, making water use more efficient and 
increasing access to clean water.   
We are collaborating with NGOs, including WWF, to further our water stewardship efforts. We are testing the ability to scale 
local supply chain efforts through joint work on textiles in China's Taihu basin. We also joined the Ceres Connect the Drops Campaign and the AgWater Challenge to advance water stewardship efforts in California.  
Target recently joined the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) organization, and plans to use its wastewater 
guidelines for our 2025 manufacturing goal for water related to owned-brand apparel textile facilities. The guidelines were  designed to help companies reduce unwanted chemicals in manufacturing and prevent them from being discharged in  wastewater and impacting surrounding communities.
For millions around the world, access to funds stand between them and safe water in their homes, so we have launched a  
partnership with Water.org. Through an initial $1 million investment, we will work together to empower people in  communities where our goods are produced, enhancing their lives by removing barriers to access affordable financing for water and sanitation.
We will continue water conservation work that is already in progress too, like our recent efforts with Conserva Irrigation to 
optimize the outdoor irrigation systems at our stores. This has already saved more than 36 million gallons of water and should be in place at more than 300 stores by the end of 2018.

working closely with industry partners, policymakers and other stakeholders to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon  economy.
While we are implementing projects in our owned-brand manufacturing facilities that will result in the avoidance of Scope 3 
emissions, within the year, we aim to develop an additional Scope 3 goal that, coupled with our Scope 1 and 2 goals, will fulfill our commitment to the Science-Based Targets initiative. This initiative provides guidance for and champions science-based target setting as a powerful way of boosting companies’ competitive advantage in the transition to a low-carbon economy. These new goals build on our 2020 commitments to improve energy efficiency, drive investments in renewable energy and lower our overall hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) impact.

MinimizationManagement Approach  
(103-1, 103-2, 103-3)103 17 Waste Stream audit sites: 14 stores, two regional distributions centers, one food distribution center
Waste Stream Audits:
In 2017, Target continued its annual waste stream audit program to understand what is being sent to landfill, by auditing  14 stores, two distribution centers and one food distribution center. Stores were selected based on store type, volume,  geography and trash volumes to try to obtain a representative sample of the full Target chain. Target uses the data from these audits, along with other data points to implement robust reporting to drive execution of our programs. Target will continue to audit locations on an ongoing basis to measure progress in line with the Waste Minimization goals.
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (RRR) Report:
Mid-2017, Target introduced the RRR Report to Property Management Field Leaders. This report provides store-level detail for Waste Minimization and Environmentally Sensitive Item Management (ESIM) programs (e.g., trash, open tops, donations, hangers). With the introduction of this report, Target has seen an improvement in all programs reported. This report also drove awareness and engagement with key partners in stores, field, distribution centers and headquarter locations. The awareness of controllable expenses and impact on environment has driven continued results towards Target’s 2020 waste diversion goal.
Vendor Partnerships:
Target works with key consultants and third-party vendors to drive innovations with waste. For example, in 2017, in  partnership with a vendor, Target introduced a webclip for store and field team members to access data from the compactor monitor to view tonnage, hauls, trigger percentage, etc. at the store level. Waste Minimization also added more commodities to their program scope in 2017 (rigid plastic, organics rollout and shopping carts) through vendor partnerships.
What’s Next:
In 2017, Target successfully piloted two programs to track Waste Minimization programs: Cardboard RFID and Donations app. Both tools are scheduled to rollout to all stores in 2018. Target is also focused on food recovery through item-level tracking, donations, organics and education for our team members and guests. This is a program that will continue to build and develop in 2018. Also, as a member of The Consumer Goods Forum, we have committed to reducing food waste within our own retail and manufacturing operations by 50 percent by 2025. Finally, we piloted a greeting card recycling program in a subset of stores that we hope to continue to expand throughout 2018.

• In 2017, Target donated over 76.9 million pounds of food (64 million meals) to Feeding America partners. In 2018, Target
will continue to deliver donations reporting at a store level to drive stronger participation and look to expand the scope ofdonatable items.
• In 2017, Target launched an organics recycling program at 66 Target store locations. Building upon the learnings from those
locations, in 2018, Target plans to expand the program to 209 additional stores (including four DCs and one FDC), totaling307 Target locations. Target will also continue to seek new partners and programs to reduce food waste going to the landfill.
• Tracking donations, recycling and organics programs at the store level continues to be a focus for Target as this data is
crucial to driving execution for Waste Minimization. In 2017, Target launched new reporting to deliver store-level data fordonations which provided visibility. This reporting increased the data received by our donations partners and droveincreased participation rates at stores.
• In 2017, the results of the waste audits showed Target the value of conducting audits and the need to establish a consistent
waste audit strategy. Target will take the learnings to drive future strategies and execution. Based on the significantopportunities found in waste audits, the need for store-level data is a top priority. With an aspiration to achieve Zero Waste,program execution, data and analytics, innovations to capture donations, organics recycling and other waste programs willneed to become more robust through execution, program awareness, resources and property level tracking.

(103-1, 103-2, 103-3)103 Goal: 
•Pay all team members a minimum hourly wage of at least $15 by the end of 2020
At Target, we value the nearly 350,000 individuals who come together as a team to serve our guests. We have long invested in our team by giving them opportunities to grow professionally; to take care of themselves, each other and their families; and to make a difference for our guests and our communities. 
We offer industry-leading resources to our team members and their families to support them in their times of need. All team 
members (and their entire household) have free, 24/7 access to trained clinicians, receive free in-person counseling sessions and can get help with things like daycare, elder care, budgeting advice or access to community resources. And in some stores, we also offer on-site counselors to support team member needs. In 2017 alone, we helped more than 76,000 team members get the support they needed.
We recognize the impact increased wages have on our team members’ ability to sustain financial stability and look after  
themselves and the people they love. That is why we have committed to pay all team members a minimum hourly wage of at least $15 by the end of 2020. We moved to an $11 minimum hourly wage in 2017. And, we took the next step by moving to a $12 minimum hourly wage earlier this year, starting with our existing team members.

Women’s  Empowerment  (in Target’s manufacturing supply chain)
Management Approach  
(103-1, 103-2, 103-3)103 Target developed three significant partnerships in 2017 related to women’s empowerment and well-being in our  
manufacturing supply chain. Target made a three-year $4.5 million commitment to fund CARE’s work in our manufacturing  supply chain communities in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam. A key component of this work is the formation of EKATA (Empowerment, Knowledge and Transformative Action) groups, which are self-help and solidarity groups of female factory workers formed in the communities where they live. EKATA groups provide training to female factory workers, facilitate access to social services and act as an information resource for other workers. The project is in the initial set-up phase of work.  
We are working with UNICEF on a pilot program designed to create an enabling environment for improved well-being of  
factory workers and their children in the apparel and footwear sector in Vietnam. Aligned to UNICEF’s mission, results for children are at the heart of this program. However, given the number of mothers specifically in the worker population, the interventions are focused heavily on women and help workers understand topics such as maternity protections, wages and working conditions.
We partnered with BSR’s HerProject, a collaborative initiative that strives to empower low-income women working in global 
supply chains. Our work focused on providing workers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China and Indonesia access to HERhealth, HERfinance and HERrespect.�2018 Corporate Responsibility Report75 GRI Standards Content Index    GRI Standard Disclosure Title Disclosure

pounds of food to Feeding America affiliates and agency partners through our stores, food and distribution centers. These pounds equate to over 64 million meals provided to communities where Target has a presence. Target also partnered with Feeding America to support the launch of seven Regional Produce Cooperatives across their affiliate network of food banks. The Cooperatives enable food banks to receive a greater variety of produce at a lower cost and with more consistency. The Cooperatives create an efficient and effective model to procure and process larger volumes of produce while allowing food banks of all sizes to receive the product needed for their local communities. Cooperatives will be able to accept more produce donations, thereby eliminating food waste throughout the supply chain.
Target also supports food banks and shelves in the Target headquarters area, and store teams actively participate with local 
area food banks. Efforts like these will continue in 2018.
