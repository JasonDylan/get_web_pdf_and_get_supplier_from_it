DENISE M. MORRISON
Dear Campbell Stakeholders,
At Campbell, our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments — has fundamentally altered how we think, 
talk and act about our food, from farm to table: from how our food is grown and the ingredients we select, to how we prepare our foods and the types of brands in our portfolio.
For nearly 150 years, Campbell has made real food and real experiences that connect our consumers to each other 
and to the world around them. People trust us to provide foods and drinks that are good, honest, authentic and flavorful — made from ingredients that are grown, prepared and cooked or baked with care.
And, now more than ever, consumers expect brands to be 
socially responsible, serve a purpose in their lives, reflect their values and beliefs, and make a difference in the world. Moreover, they want companies like ours to be authentic and open, particularly about how and where their food is made, why certain ingredients are used and how those ingredients are produced and sourced.
We welcome this era of transparency as a new opportunity 
to connect with consumers. We know the people who buy our foods hold us to a higher standard, and we welcome that accountability. That’s our character as a company.
In January 2016, we became the first major food 
company to call for a mandatory national labeling standard for products that may contain genetically modified organisms (GMO) and proposed that the federal government provide a national standard for non-GMO claims made on food packaging. 
This decision was guided by our Purpose, rooted in our 
consumer-first mindset, and driven by our commitment to transparency — to be open and honest about our food. We have always believed that consumers have the right  
to know what’s in their food. GMO has evolved to be a top consumer food issue, reaching a critical mass of consumers in favor of putting it on the label. The time has come for the federal government to level the playing field and provide food companies with clear direction, definitions and standards for disclosure. I truly believe it is the right thing to do for consumers and for our business.That’s also what led to the creation of www.whatsinmyfood.com, where we provide detailed information for top products, such as our iconic Campbell’s Condensed Tomato and Chicken Noodle soups. It is a big step toward being even more open and honest with our consumers — about what goes into our food, about how we make our food and about the choices behind the ingredients we use. In 2016, we intend to add information on all of our major products in the U.S. and Canada to the website, with subsequent plans to expand globally. Through this engagement, we will explain the reasons for our choices and use feedback from stakeholders as valuable input to guide future decisions about our food.
It is an extension of work we’ve been doing for years. 
For example, while many of our North American products already contain no artificial colors or flavors, based in large part on consumer feedback, we are working to eliminate most of the remaining artificial colors and flavors from this portfolio by the end of fiscal 2018. 
This is bigger than removing certain ingredients from 
our products. It represents the start of a real-food design philosophy — one that simultaneously harkens back to our roots with an eye on the future, to ensure the food we make is the food that consumers want, that tastes great and that is made with real ingredients that fit into their real lives.  
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT StrategySTRATEGY  |  9We depend on sustainable agriculture, clean water 
and a resilient supply chain to produce the crops and ingredients needed to make our food. Indeed, our commitment to sustainable agriculture is literally part of our roots. 
We are the largest carrot grower in North America, 
and many of our tomatoes come from generations  of American family farmers who have been in our network for more than 100 years. We strive to support those farms and farming families, and they in turn, year after year, continue to help us serve our consumers who rely on our products for their own moments that matter. 
I thank you for your interest in our company, and  
our commitment to corporate responsibility and 
sustainability. When you read through this report,  
I hope that you are as inspired as I am by what our employees are doing to ensure that we strive unerringly for sustainable, responsible operations every day, and I invite you to let us know what you think at csr_feedback@campbellsoup.com.
As the leader of Campbell Soup Company, I know 
we can make a profit and make a difference, and  
we are doing both through our business and by living our Purpose in a way that’s authentic, that’s transparent and that truly matters.
Best,
Denise M. Morrison

STRATEGY  |  14Taking a Fresh Approach 
Running a responsible food business begins at the farm and 
ends at the table, but every detail in between matters to us. We must leverage our Purpose at all points along our value chain — making Real food that matters for life’s moments the filter for all of our decision making. Our key strategies set forth in FY2015 included plans to drive deeper transparency into how our foods and beverages are made in an effort to build greater consumer trust and to increase our focus on health, well-being, fresh and better-for-you products.
Consumers demand greater transparency, which supports 
both a resilient supply chain and resilient healthy communities where we live and work. Our consumers trust us to govern ourselves in a way that will reliably bring our products to their table for their own moments that matter — in a way that is not simply conscious of profit, but also of our impact on the planet and people. 
For this reason, we put corporate responsibility (CR) and 
sustainability at the heart of our Purpose and core business strategies. At Campbell, we define CR and sustainability as advancing global nutrition and wellness; helping build a more sustainable environment; and honoring our role in society, from the farm to the family. 
To ensure that we held ourselves accountable to our Purpose, 
in FY2015 we conducted our annual formal strategic planning process. The practice allows us to take a step back each year and reassess and refine our core strategies, including CR, sustainability and community affairs. This process, coupled with stakeholder engagement and a broad assessment of key external drivers in the marketplace, helps to inform business-wide and individual performance goals for the coming year.
Our strategic plan for CR and sustainability rests on four 
key pillars:
• Environmental stewardship;• Engaging with our customers and consumers;• Community impact; and• Building a high-performance workplace.
Setting the Bar High for CR Governance 
Our formalized governance structure helps us to successfully 
integrate CR and sustainability into our everyday operations. This structure begins with the support of our CEO and oversight by our Board of Directors, and flows down into the culture of Campbell’s workforce leadership and management.With nearly eight years of a formalized CR and sustainability program under our belt, we continue to make strides  
in the way we manage and oversee CR-related decisions and strategies across the enterprise. Our Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability, Dave Stangis, is responsible for leading our global CR and sustainability strategies. Dave reports to President and CEO Denise Morrison. Annual updates on CR and sustainability are also provided to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
Recently, we improved our sustainability governance 
structure by redesigning our Sustainability Leadership Team and moving to a Sustainability Leadership Network with oversight from a Sustainability Steering Committee. The Network is a cross-functional team consisting of leaders in sustainable agriculture, environmental engineering, packaging, procurement and supply chain. 
The Network is responsible for developing short- and 
long-term goals, strengthening metrics and providing quarterly updates to the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is composed of senior leaders from each of our operating divisions as well as from global engineering, corporate responsibility, global procurement, research  
and development and supply chain. 
At the end of the day, however, it is the many Campbell 
employees who work day in and day out to bring our  CR and sustainability strategy to life, through formal job assignments as well as participation in our plant facility green teams, employee-led Sustainability Network and various volunteer initiatives.

STRATEGY  |  16Proactive, consistent stakeholder engagement with a variety 
of internal and external audiences is critical to implementing an effective CR and sustainability strategy. Along with the wide reach we have as an industry-leading company comes an immense responsibility to be a good listener to those who are impacted by our business operations. Each of our stakeholders, at all points along the value chain, warrants regular dialogue on the issues and concerns that are top of mind for them. These discussions and continued collaborations provide us with perspectives that then inform our strategic priorities and help to build a competitive advantage. We make sure to have a range of touchpoints with stakeholders throughout the year, including meetings, conferences, roundtable discussions, community meetings, interviews and surveys. 
Our three-pronged approach to stakeholder engagement 
includes identifying issues that are most important to  
our stakeholders; setting processes for meaningful and effective engagement; and benchmarking for leadership performance within and outside our sector. Beyond engagement, we make it a priority to respond to the issues identified through our thorough stakeholder efforts. We do so through various collaborative measures, including creative public-private partnerships, CEO engagement in industry and CR organizations, and through our Scientific Advisory Panel.

STRATEGY  |  17Health and Nutrition Stakeholder Engagement  
& Research 
Many of today’s complex nutrition issues require a 
collaborative and multidisciplinary approach to solutions that span the public and private sectors. As an industry leader, Campbell has established a legacy in performing and supporting health and nutrition research through innovative partnerships with stakeholders that in

• Supporting the Produce for Better Health Foundation, 
as a donor and through participation in the marketing and communications and research subcommittees and through sponsorship of their annual meeting
• Collaborating with retailer health and wellness programs 
through the development of nutrition education resources, including recipes that aligned with the Dietary Guidlines for Americans, coupon and recipe booklets, nutrition articles and more
• Hosting a group of 100 retail dietitians at World

• Conducting an annual survey of dietitians to collect 
feedback on our products, clients’ consumption and referral habits, nutritional characteristics of products and resources they seek for clients
• Sustaining Arnott’s partnership with the Dietitians 
Association of Australia (DAA), the governing body of dietetic and nutrition professionals in Australia, through which Arnott’s supports professional development. Arnott’s also contributes to the Grains & Legumes Nutrition Council, the independent authority on the nutrition and health benefits of grains and legumes.• Sponsoring the annual Dietitians of Canada conference 
in Quebec City with about 900 dietitian attendees
• Engaging with the Interfaith Center on Corporate 
Responsibility on public health issues, including obesity, undernutrition and access to nutrition

2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Strategy
In order to help Campbell identify and prioritize our 
most relevant issues related to CR and sustainability, we conducted an in-depth materiality assessment this year. This process allowed us to better understand how the priorities and concerns of external stakeholders align with our business priorities and CR objectives. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Reporting Guidelines mandate that organizations do a materiality assessment as part of their reporting process to inform what are the most critical — or “material” — issues to report. 
Campbell defines CR material issues as those that 
influence the judgment and decisions of our external and internal stakeholders and have an impact on our stakeholders and business today and in the future. In order to identify the key issues of importance, we seek the input of a variety of stakeholder groups and measure the risks and opportunities for all relevant environmental, social and governance topics. Our goal in this process is to help inform our overall CR and sustainability strategies, set priorities and ensure that our annual CR Report communicates how we are managing those material issues.
Our assessment adhered to the following steps:
Step 1: Identification of Issues
We reviewed publicly available CR communications of 
our peer set, including CR reports, press releases and corporate websites, to analyze what CR issues and initiatives currently are of priority across our industry. We then conducted a thorough media audit of trade, CR and mainstream media outlets to understand what issues are trending and of the highest concern in the news. We also had conversations with various NGOs, investors and CR organizations to confirm our findings. 
Step 2: Stakeholder Survey
We organized a widespread survey of global employees, customers (retailers), suppliers, NGOs, community partners, government or regulatory agencies, investors, trade organizations and consumers. The survey was not only sent directly to targeted external stakeholders, but was also posted publicly on Twitter and LinkedIn to gather input from as varied an audience as possible. In total, we received responses from more than 1,250 survey participants.Step 3: Stakeholder Interviews
To further vet the issues and rankings as identified by the survey results, we conducted detailed stakeholder interviews. Sustainable Brands interviewed five internal stakeholders, while Business for Social Responsibility interviewed five external stakeholders. In addition, we did post-survey interviews internally with more than  60 employees globally and 12 external stakeholders. 
Our stakeholders were asked to rate the importance 
of each of the following issues identified in our initial materiality research, including: 
Responsible Business Practices
• Transparency: Communicating openly with 
stakeholders on material issues and being clear with 
customers and consumers about what is in our food and where it comes from
• Responsible Sourcing Practices: Addressing issues in 
the supply chain, including human rights, workplace safety, being capable of fully tracing product inputs to their supply source, and full traceability of product inputs in our supply chain
• Sustainable Business Models: Doing business in a 
way that increases the size of the business while simultaneously reducing our environmental footprint and increasing positive social impact
• Business Ethics: Upholding ethical principles in the 
business and workplace, including consumer privacy, fraud, bribery, corruption and corporate governance
• Public Policy and Engagement: Actively engaging in 
public policy on issues affecting our industry
Society
• Health, Nutrition and Wellness: Improving the health 
profile of our products and engaging in public 
discussions on healthy and nutritious lifestyles
• Animal Welfare: Ensuring the ethical treatment of 
animals in our value chain
• Food Access: Ensuring wholesome, nutritional food 
is available to as many people as possible in an affordable manner
• Community Involvement: Improving the communities 
in which we live and work through philanthropic efforts, including donations, volunteerism and other community programming
• Human Rights in the Supply Chain: Combatting 
child labor and forced labor in the supply chain and evaluating our suppliers in the area of human rightsMATERIALITY

Step 4: Validation
Campbell’s CR Steering Committee met to review the findings and validate the issues. Then these issues were presented to various company leaders who also provided their input on the importance of these issues to Campbell’s overall company strategies. 
Based on the results of these steps, we created a 
materiality grid, which maps where our long-term business success aligns with marketplace and stakeholder priorities. We will utilize these findings to identify and validate opportunities for strengthening our CR and sustainability strategy and reporting in the future.

HEALTH, NUTRITION & AWARENESS
 
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products
Our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments — guides how we think about nutrition and health. It is our 
North Star amidst today’s dramatically shifting food landscape. As a key voice in the food industry, we must ensure that our products are relevant and meet the expectations of our nutrition-savvy consumers, who are increasingly demanding healthier and fresher food with minimal artificial ingredients and processing. 
It is imperative for Campbell to stay abreast of changes in food and nutrition to better understand how we can 
provide our customers with the healthy food they desire and thus identify the opportunities we have for growth. In 2015, the food world continued to shift in unprecedented ways. These changes are reshaping the way food is grown, made, marketed, sold and consumed. In turn, an evolving food and nutrition landscape is fundamentally altering the way we think, talk and act about our products. We know that if we don’t evolve with these trends, we will not be able to thrive as a food company. Some of the trends influencing our food and nutrition strategy are:
Rise in Chronic Diseases
 
According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, rates of chronic diseases related to poor-quality 
diet and physical inactivity have increased, with half of all U.S. adults having one or more preventable, diet-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overweight and obesity. 
Heightened Consumer Interest in Fresh and Healthy Foods
Consumer interest in health and wellness is growing as they recognize the role diet plays in health and well-being. 
They are demanding healthier, more “real foods,” which we define as foods with fewer artificial ingredients and minimal processing. Consumers are increasingly seeking fresh, natural, organic products and those made with ingredients they recognize. They are telling us to avoid artificial preservatives, colors and flavors and are seeking products with vegetables, whole grains and other components associated with good health. 
Intersection of Health and Technology
We refer to the increased fusion of health and technology as society becoming “wired for well-being,” and it will 
have a profound impact on consumers’ food choices. People will soon make decisions about what to eat or what PRODUCTS  |  25How We Manage
Consumer demand and these evolving food trends, 
along with an industry call for greater transparency, were key drivers behind our decision to take a step back and give our nutrition strategy a refresh. In FY2015, we outlined our new corporate Strategic Imperatives, which included expanding our business in the areas of fresh and well-being. To help meet our new Strategic Imperatives, we implemented a major restructuring of the company. By reorganizing our business to prioritize food categories rather than regions, health and well-being became even more embedded into our products and overall corporate responsibility strategy. We will continue to accelerate growth in our Campbell Fresh division and expand into new categories in the packaged fresh category, as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
We aspire, with this new approach, to make Campbell 
even more synonymous with real and better-for-you foods in the future. Moving forward, Campbell will continue to evolve its health and wellness strategies and policies to reflect these consumer demands. Currently, we are doing this by:
• measuring our progress;
• expanding our healthy product portfolio; and• engaging and educating our consumers.not to eat based on individual needs. Consumers are already leading “quantified lives” — tracking their activities  
and fitness through “wearables” that measure aspects of their overall health. The emerging trend in this area is bio-
monitoring. We’re seeing it in health care and medicine, and it is only a matter of time before it impacts the food industry. In the future, consumers will no longer wonder about the “right food” for them because bio-sensors will  
scan their metabolism and recommend the “right” diets.
Our consumers are also increasingly using digital tools to shop and share their opinions about food. People love to 
socialize about the food they cook, shop for and eat. They take photos of their food and share, like and comment on their friends’ experiences through social media. This creates interesting opportunities for Campbell that we’re actively exploring.
Consumer Demand for Greater Transparency
Consumers today are savvy and have greater expectations of food companies to disclose how and where their food 
is made, which ingredients are used and how those ingredients are produced and sourced. In its 2015 Global Annual Review, PWC cited food integrity and transparency as one of four colliding megatrends, noting: “High profile  
contamination, adulteration and fraud incidents in the US, Europe and Asia have eroded public trust in the food industry, raising consumer awareness of food quality and ensuing safety risks. There is growing demand for higher quality food and transparency of food ingredients, origins and production processes, especially among the world’s growing urban middle class.”

PRODUCTS  |  26Our Progress
In order to ensure that our products reflect the latest 
nutrition findings and consumer demands, we lean on the expertise of our nutrition and health stakeholders and partners to find better-for-you product solutions. We are constantly seeking ways to improve the nutritional value of our food and beverages so that we can, in turn, help people improve their diets and meet their personal health goals. To do this, Campbell seeks to reduce the nutrients or ingredients of concern in our products such as saturated fats, sodium, sugar and artificial ingredients. At the same time, we pursue positive nutrition by increasing vegetables, whole grains, and other food components or nutrients underconsumed in the diet.Measuring Progress
We know that this is a journey, and we must set goals and make progress against them each year. Since 2010, we’ve measured our progress by making continuous improvements in the sales of better-for-you products. To track our progress against these goals, we evaluate the nutrition of our products against government and other scientifically accepted criteria, and in FY2015, expanded this assessment to include our global product portfolio.

Offering a Portfolio of Healthy Options 
Campbell believes that consumers should have options from which to choose, especially when it comes to better-for-you products. We are committed to promoting and encouraging healthy eating by creating products that are not only nutritious, but affordable, and meet the local and regional tastes and customs of our diverse customer base.
In FY2015, we brought consumers even more variety to 
the grocery store shelf by: • Expanding our organic offerings; 
• Building out our lean, lower-calorie, no added sugar, 
no artificial ingredient and “light” product lines;
• Launching two new varieties of Goldfish Snacks that 
contain 12 g or more of whole grains per serving; 
• Growing our fresh division with the acquisition of 
Garden Fresh Gourmet; and
• Simplifying our recipes to remove ingredients that 
our consumers do not want.  
CRITERIA 
 
Government criteria for 
“healthy” foods
 
Efforts to reduce or limit nutrients that, in excess, may contribute to negative health outcomes. 
 
The contribution of our foods to a healthful diet through the provision of food groups or nutrients that are underconsumed in the diet 
$2.9 billion, or 29 percent, of total gross sales of foods met the definition of “healthy,” defined as those foods with nutritional profiles satisfying the FDA and other globally accepted criteria for our entire global portfolio. This is an approximate $215 million, or 8.6 percent, increase over FY2014 in the U.S and includes an additional $205 million in international sales.
 
$5.4 billion, or 53 percent, of total gross sales were generated by products brought to market that are lower in calories, saturated fat, trans fats, sodium and/or total sugars. 
 
$3.2 billion, or 32 percent, of total gross sales of consumer products globally that make a positive contribution to the diet through servings of fruits and vegetables or are a good source of fiber, vitamins, or minerals. This is a $259 million, or 9.7 percent, increase in the U.S. with an additional  
$275 million coming from international sales.

PRODUCTS  |  29Engaging and Educating Our Consumers 
We believe we have a responsibility to engage and inform our 
consumers about health and nutrition as it relates to our products so they can make food decisions that are good for their health and the well-being of their families. To help them make informed decisions, we present our consumers with a variety of tools and resources — on-package, online and through other communication channels. 
Most importantly, when a product is in hand, we ensure that 
the item contains simple language or obvious markers to help consumers identify health criteria. Consumers can also feel confident that any health claim made on the label is backed by stringent criteria developed by third-party experts. For instance,  
all of our products claiming to be “healthy” are required to meet the FDA nutritional criteria. 
In 2015, we continued to engage with consumers in a number 
of ways to empower them with nutritional know-how and meal planning, including:
• A weekly Meal-Mail newsletter electronically delivers meal ideas 
and recipes to more than 650,000 busy U.S. customers. 
• Campbell’s Kitchen website (www.campbellskitchen.com)  
offers consumers quick, easy, delicious recipes along with 
timesaving tips and coupon savings. 
• Cook with Campbell’s website (www.cookwithcampbells.ca) 
connects on-the-go Canadian consumers with simple meal planning and preparation ideas. They also offer a monthly Meal-Mail with recipes for consumers.
• Ideas for Innovation website (www.campbellideas.com)  
gives employees, consumers, customers, suppliers, contractors, inventors and friends the opportunity to share their ideas with us, including how to improve the health and nutrition of our products.
• Campbell’s Online Nutrition Portal (www.campbellnutrition.com) 
offers consumers the inside scoop on the nutritional attributes of our products, and helps consumers make choices that align with the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Consumers are able to search Campbell offerings by beneficial nutrients, dietary restrictions, nutritional needs and by brand or product name.
We also always welcome the feedback of our consumers, and our Consumer Affairs team reviews and addresses all inquiries, whether it is through our surveys, toll-free telephone number, letters, emails, social media engagement using @CampbellCares or our “Chat with Us” feature on our corporate website.

IMPLEMENTING HEALTH RATINGS  DOWN UNDER
As part of our global commitment to health and 
wellness and a long-standing history of providing our consumers with clear nutrition information to help inform choices, our Arnott’s brand, one of Australia’s largest biscuit and snack producers, has begun progressively implementing a voluntary Health Star Rating (HSR) that was approved by the Australian Federal Government in June 2014. We are currently determining the best way to integrate the HSR system with existing on-pack information across the entire Arnott’s range, but products displaying the HSR are already starting to appear on shelf. 
LISTENING TO CONSUMERS’ NEEDS
There are many small decisions that go into each and every purchase in the average American household. As a food company making items and ingredients found on store shelves, it is our job to understand what consumers want in a healthy food product  and how they find what they’re looking for, as well as anticipating what they might want next. 
Our Consumer and Customer Insights Department 
(CCID) does just that: they listen to and spend time with our consumers to understand their lives and their needs. CCID’s research helps us create healthy, nutritious products that best fit consumers’ lives and communicate with them in a way that makes sense to each individual’s personal journey, from what they’ll have for dinner, to what they’ll snack on during the day, and what they may plan to eat next week.
By understanding and immersing themselves 
into these consumers’ lives, CCID can identify meaningful and lasting ways to connect them with Campbell’s brands, and those insights can help fuel innovation. In order to make products that continue to meet changing tastes and needs around nutrition, our team is focused on knowing consumers in each part of their journey at every stage of the day — especially before they get to the last-minute question of “what do you want to eat?”
PRODUCTS  |  30Changing Recipes for the Better 
In FY2015, based on feedback from parents, we simplified the recipes of our existing 
Campbell’s Condensed kids’ soups and removed MSG, while continuing to make  the soups without artificial preservatives, colors or flavors. Currently, 98 percent of our portfolio is free of artificial or added preservatives, colors and flavors. We also announced plans to eliminate the use of artificial colors and flavors in our North American portfolio by the end of FY2018. Additionally, we created the NO GO list: NO artificial flavors or colors; NO added preservatives; and NO MSG. These ingredients will not be used in any new product we are creating in the Americas Division and we will continue to look for ways to reduce our use of high fructose corn syrup.
Extending Our Fresh Options 
We continue to grow our better-for-you portfolio through strategic acquisitions. In 2015 we acquired Garden Fresh Gourmet, another milestone in our efforts to increase our presence and sales in the packaged fresh category. Garden Fresh Gourmet makes the number-one branded refrigerated salsa in the U.S., along with hummus, dips and tortilla chips. This acquisition is another milestone in reshaping our portfolio toward faster-growing categories. Garden Fresh Gourmet’s on-trend products will allow the Campbell Fresh division to expand in the deli section of the grocery store perimeter and will complement our strong presence in the produce section. 
This is the latest in a series of moves we have made in response to increased consumer 
interest in fresh foods and health and well-being, first with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms followed by the acquisition of Plum. Garden Fresh Gourmet is part of the Campbell Fresh division, which leverages the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated platform. Packaged fresh foods represent a $19+ billion category that grew 4.9 percent in the past year, above the industry average. 
Organic Gets the Spotlight 
Organic eating is a priority for many Americans, and we want to make sure that those who choose to eat organic — no matter where they live — have options that are both authentic and delicious. We live in a food culture where consumers are increasingly seeking foods that are made with simple, natural and organic ingredients. According to the Organic Trade Association, 81 percent of U.S. families already choose organic foods at least some of the time, and more than half of consumers ages 18 to 29 are actively trying to include organic foods in their diet. 
To meet this growing demand, we increased our organic offerings with line extensions in 
our core portfolio. In early 2015, we launched Campbell’s Organic, a line of six premium, ready-to-eat soups, which includes vegetarian and gluten-free varieties. Building off this momentum, we also introduced three organic kids’ soups, Mega Noodle, Chicken and Stars and Disney Princess Frozen. These soups are non-GMO and use ingredients sourced from certified American Organic farms. We also expanded the Plum line of organic food for babies, tots and kids, launching 29 new organic meals and snacks in the U.S. and expanding the brand to Canada.

YOU ARE WHAT YOU POST
In 2015, Bolthouse Farms challenged consumers to a “Fruit and Veggie Takeover” 
of the Internet. This consumer engagement project resulted from a survey of what food images people share on social media. On this journey to track the health of the Internet, we found that on average, there were more than 1.7 million food hashtags used each day. Of those hashtags, only 37 percent were of fruits and veggies, with the majority composed of foods like bacon, pizza and donuts. The Takeover was intended to shift this imbalance and put fruit and veggies in the social media spotlight. By changing the foods posted online, we can inspire healthier eating habits offline. During March, Bolthouse Farms challenged consumers to participate for one week to help reach the goal of one million “healthy” images per day by posting and tagging fruit and veggies using the #urwhatupost hashtag.
PRODUCTS  |  31The food industry is in the midst of revolutionary change. Changing demographics, socioeconomic shifts and digital 
connectivity are forcing the industry to adapt and evolve. One of the most pervasive shifts is around transparency. Consumers are seeking transparency in all areas of their lives, driven by an inherent distrust in large institutions. This distrust has been accelerated by digital connectivity where information and debate are available in one click. 
For the food industry this translates into consumers’ desire to know what’s in the food they buy, where it is made and 
how the food is produced. A new generation of consumers is seeking food that better aligns with their values, and is authentic, natural and wholesome. And, they expect a level of transparency at each step of the supply chain — from farm to table. 
Campbell believes that providing easy access to this information builds consumer trust — something we have invested in 
doing for more than 145 years. In this new era of transparency, we are on a journey to be open and honest about our business and earn the trust of a new generation of consumers.
In this changing environment, Campbell’s Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments — serves as our North Star. It is a filter we apply to strategic decisions and informs the way we engage with our consumers. It has also been a guiding factor in identifying strategic imperatives that we feel are key to our success, one of which is transparency. We have made a commitment to set the standard for transparency in the food industry. We are doing this by engaging our consumers in conversation that allows us to address the issues that are most meaningful to them. Actions such as introducing mandatory GMO labeling on all products, removing artificial colors and flavors from our recipes, and transitioning to non-BPA packaging are all a part of this journey. It has also inspired us to look at our recipes and use more of the ingredients people tell us they want, and less of those they would prefer to avoid. As part of our efforts, we have also launched a website where we are open about the ingredients we use and the choices we have made.Material Issue

Why It Matters
How We Manage
PRODUCTS  |  32What’s in My Food?
Campbell’s purpose-driven commitment to setting a 
new bar for transparency in the food industry led us to take a big step in FY2015 by sharing with our consumers what goes into our food, how we make our food and why we make the choices behind the ingredients used in our food. The impetus for these decisions followed extensive consumer research about what they wanted to know about food. Our intent is not to be perfect, but rather to strive continuously for an open exchange of information so consumers can make the most informed choices possible for themselves and their families. 
The centerpiece of this new direction has been the 
introduction of a website — www.whatsinmyfood.com — where consumers can access a wide range of information about our products, and have questions and concerns addressed in one easily accessible place. This site provides information on several of our top brands, such as iconic Campbell’s Condensed soups, V8 beverages, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish and SpaghettiOs. These steps are just the beginning, and there is a great deal of work ahead of us. In order to create a more open and honest dialogue, we welcome feedback that will help us on this journey. 
We have also been proactive in transparency of 
ingredients derived from GMO crops, and, in 2015, we became the first major food company to disclose the presence of these ingredients made from GMO crops in our products via our website, www.whatsinmyfood.com. Our decision was guided by our Purpose, rooted in our consumer-first mindset, and driven by our commitment to transparency — to be open and honest about our food. We believe it is the right thing to do for consumers and for our business.
Responsible Labeling
GMO Labeling
One of the most hotly debated topics within the issue  
of transparency in the U.S. is the labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). An overwhelming majority of U.S. consumers today believe that they have the right to know what is in their food and want food companies to label GMOs on their products. There is currently no U.S. federal regulation requiring labeling to inform consumers about the presence of GMOs in their food. Campbell believes that consumers have a right to know what is in their food, and that is why we support mandatory national GMO labeling. However, we oppose a state-by-state “patchwork approach,” as we believe it is incomplete, impractical and costly to implement for food makers. More importantly, it is confusing to consumers. Therefore, in FY2016, we formally announced our support for the enactment of federal legislation in the U.S. to establish a single mandatory labeling standard for foods derived from GMOs.
The decisions we have made with regard to GMOs have 
not been because we dispute the science behind GMOs or their safety. The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence indicates that GMOs are safe and that foods derived from crops using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. In the U.S., many farmers who grow canola, corn, soybean and sugar beets choose to use genetically modified seeds and have done so for nearly 20 years. More than 90 percent of these four crops in America are currently grown using GMO seeds. It takes an average of 13 years to get a GMO seed approved by the government for safety. Ingredients derived from these crops are in many of our products and we will continue to use them. We also believe that technology will play a crucial role in feeding the world. For us, it is simply a matter of transparency. 
Facts Up Front
With Facts Up Front, we collaborated with the Grocery 
Manufacturers Association and the Food Marketing Institute to provide consumers with a voluntary and uniform “front of pack” labeling scheme. We place icons on the front of products displaying their calorie count, saturated fat, sodium and sugar content per serving. Facts Up Front supports the current Nutrition Facts Panel appearing on the reverse of our products, and is consistent with current FDA and USDA food labeling regulations. By the end of FY2015, 100 percent of Campbell’s and Pepperidge Farm products displayed the Facts Up Front icons. Transition and timing for new brands and acquisitions is in development.

Why It Matters
Food safety is receiving unprecedented attention in the marketplace and in the public policy arena today. It is easy 
to see why: the Centers for Disease Control and Protection report that about 48 million people, or one in six Americans, suffer from food-borne illness every year; 128,000 people are hospitalized and 3,000 die. Yet foodborne illnesses are largely preventable. Food safety and quality are assumed requirements for any major food company in the industry today. It is a given that we will dedicate every resource to ensuring that our consumers are protected from foodborne illnesses, allergens or other health and safety concerns. We know that if we aren’t diligent in our food safety processes, there are significant financial and reputational implications that could be devastating.
We closely monitor our product safety throughout the 
entire value chain — from the moment ingredients are harvested on the farm to the minute finished products leave our distribution centers. As we strive to implement continuous improvement, our quality control systems are kept up to date with the most modern technology, while meeting the industry’s highest standards for quality assurance.We have a long history of regulatory compliance, as well as quality standards and policies that are industry-leading and global in approach. We require these standards of our own facilities, as well as of our contract manufacturers and suppliers abroad. In 2015, we kept a close watch on the latest food safety trends and research, shared best practices with peers as a leading member of the Grocery Manufacturers Association and maintained our commitment to Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certification for all of our manufacturing facilities.

FOOD SAFETY & QUALITY
 
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products
PRODUCTS  |  34Our Progress
Ingredient Safety
Our products are only as safe as the individual ingredients 
used in them. That’s why we invest in supplier engagement around ingredient safety. We collaborate directly with our suppliers, packaging companies and co-manufacturers to ensure that our product ingredients and packaging materials are safe and that quality controls match our stringent standards. 
To maintain these relationships, we work with our 
partners to help align their operations with new rules and regulations in food safety and quality standards. Our Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual, 
updated on a regular basis, outlines our strict safety and quality requirements. Suppliers are subject to occasional comprehensive audits so that we can make certain our high standards are being followed. We also use preventive control systems like the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and prerequisite programs, at both our facilities and supplier facilities. 
Food Safety Modernization Act
Under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2011, foreign suppliers are required to verify that their food safety systems and programs meet U.S. standards before their products are permitted to enter U.S. commerce. We use a worldwide mapping system of our supply base to review and monitor sourced product ingredients and track supplier performance and compliance. In 2015, new requirements were added under the FSMA, creating stricter guidelines on preventive controls, produce safety and foreign supplier verification and third-party auditors. 
Allergens
In order to protect those consumers who have allergies to certain ingredients, a priority in the manufacturing process is to minimize the risk of allergens ending up in food products by mistake. Food allergens at Campbell facilities are regulated using strict internal controls that safeguard our consumers against any cross-contact with unintended ingredients. Our data system is designed to maintain the accuracy of label ingredient statements and allergen disclosures, and our own advanced coding and scanning technology verifies individual packages for labeling accuracy, allergen control and product traceability. Some of the food allergens that Campbell monitors include fin fish, peanuts, wheat, shellfish, tree nuts, soy protein, eggs, sesame seeds, dairy protein and gluten.

Managing Quality 
Our goal for food safety and quality is zero tolerance for variance, and we maintain robust standards and controls to eliminate and avoid hazards. However, we are always prepared to take swift action when and if we suspect that the safety of a product is compromised or at any degree of risk. For any class of food safety incident, our crisis management team responds swiftly, working in tandem with the appropriate regulatory agency and internal teams to initiate a recall process. In this process, consumers are alerted about the safety concern, and we take steps to remove the product immediately from store warehouses and shelves. Working through protocols established by government agencies around the world, Campbell teams provide regular updates to the agencies on the scope and status of any product recall. During the execution of any recall, we will provide ongoing support to consumers and our retail trade customers to address any questions and concerns they may have. After a recall, Campbell implements an in-depth root-cause analysis to take the necessary corrective actions.Continuous Improvement
Our Global Quality and Food Safety organization focuses its efforts not only on prevention but also on continuous improvement of its programs. Each year, the organization works diligently to build stronger and more effective food safety and quality systems. We work continuously to fine-tune our systems and practices to ensure not only strict adherence to our policies and standards, but also to our ongoing objective of getting every aspect of product quality “right the first time.” The organization sets measurable goals from year to year, and, in FY2015, consumer complaints and incident rates were driven down. Our quality teams have fostered an exacting food safety mindset across our businesses, and these efforts are showing measurable and sustainable results in auditing, statistical process monitoring and supplier oversight. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement, we can effectively manage risk, while delivering excellent products to our customers.
 PRODUCTS  |  35Why It Matters
How We Manage
As a global food company, we have the responsibility to ensure that the way in which we source our ingredients is 
both sustainable and ethical. We understand that our supply chain is key to delivering uncompromising value to our customers and consumers. We continuously seek to enhance the quality of our products and brands, not only by the ingredients we use, but also by working with suppliers who meet our responsible sourcing standards. 
Understanding and mitigating the environmental, economic and social risks within our supply chain is necessary 
to ensure our products are produced in a responsible manner. By incorporating responsible sourcing practices, we are able to mitigate negative impacts to the environment, realize economic savings, improve supplier relationships, reduce social, reputational, environmental and financial risks, and ensure long-term resiliency. 
Last year, we developed a strategic approach to address our evolving supply chains and focus on more ethical and sustainable sourcing. Our Procurement Sustainability strategy focuses on the following key areas:
• Understanding and Managing Risks;
• Engaging our Suppliers;• Setting Expectations; and• Managing Performance.This past year, as a result of the findings from our 
materiality process, we have identified the need to further enhance this strategy and put additional resources in place to address the increased expectations of both our internal and external stakeholders. We are currently building out this strategy and intend to provide additional details about the strategy in FY2016. Material Issue
RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
 
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products
PRODUCTS  |  36Understanding and Managing Risk 
Our supply chain risk management process consists  
of three parts: risk identification, risk analysis and risk 
mitigation. We’ve identified “hot spots” within our supply chain related to sustainability issues and are proactive with our suppliers to address these key issues. Our risk analysis model includes sustainability, financial and supply risks associated with our product categories. Currently, our most important risks are associated with the rising cost of raw materials, impacts to climate and deforestation, brand and reputational damage, business disruption, regulatory challenges and supply chain interruption. 
In 2015, we embedded value chain risk mapping as part 
of the overall purchasing manager’s category strategy. When a Campbell buyer develops their strategy for an ingredient or raw material, we develop tools to consider sustainability as part of the value-added opportunity. Our formal supply chain mapping system gives us a holistic view of our entire supply chain and shows areas of opportunity to collaborate with suppliers to improve functionality and sustainability, while driving cost savings. 
Engaging Our Suppliers 
One of the key elements of our strategy is to partner and collaborate with our suppliers to better understand sustainability issues in each category. Campbell collaborates with strategic suppliers on sustainability issues through our Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) program. Our SRM program enhances and expands our regular communications and idea exchanges with select suppliers, engaging them on topics such as sustainability projects, best practices and benchmarking, while addressing emerging trends in ethical and responsible sourcing. Our ultimate goal is to leverage these critical relationships for a mutual gain. Our SRM program once again proved to be successful in 2015 by establishing best practices in sustainability, cost savings and responsible sourcing.
Setting Expectations 
Because responsible sourcing is integral to delivering the company’s Purpose, we require our suppliers to follow environmental and social standards that are aligned with our expectations. Our Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual identifies the expectations and 
requirements for current and potential brokers, co-packers, re-packers, special packers, suppliers, warehouses and licensees to meet our CR and sustainability objectives. These standards cover a variety of critical subjects, including legal compliance, health and safety, human rights, quality, governance, animal welfare, environmental issues and employment standards. If a supplier is found to be out of compliance with the requirements, they are required to develop a formal corrective action plan — allowing Campbell to directly engage with the supply chain on responsible sourcing performance. In FY2016, we plan to revise the manual to reflect more rigorous expectations related to sustainability and ethical sourcing. Managing Performance 
Our Supplier Sustainability Scorecard captures environmental performance metrics, as well as social responsibility efforts, to better understand the policies and practices of our supply base. The Scorecard allows Campbell to benchmark and identify supply chain opportunities, especially where Campbell can directly engage suppliers on sustainability. We expect that the Scorecard will become a competitive differentiator when reviewing future supplier relationships. Our Campbell-certified auditors also conduct onsite audits of our suppliers, based on the standards laid out in our supplier base manual, and we perform third-party audits to maintain high accountability and performance. Follow-up audits and assessments are conducted based on the risk potential of supply interruption.

Commitments and Progress
Supply chain issues in the food industry have grown 
increasingly complex in today’s global economy, making visibility a constant challenge for major food brands such as ours. We hear increasingly from our external stakeholders — including NGOs, suppliers, industry and professional associations, consumers, academic institutions and other outside experts — that supply chain issues are a top corporate responsibility concern. 
We collaborate with these stakeholders and rely on 
their expertise to better understand their concerns, communicate and establish a position, provide information and, when appropriate, take corrective action. A few examples of the types of NGO groups we engage with include the Humane Society of the United States, the Rainforest Action Network, GreenAmerica, Environmental Defense Fund and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. While we are currently evaluating our ethical and sustainable supply chain strategy, we have made commitments and progress in some key areas. 
Deforestation 
Deforestation is a major concern among many NGOs 
and other stakeholders. Irresponsible sourcing of ingredients such as palm oil, soy, beef and pulp/paper can harm fragile ecosystems and impact many vulnerable communities. We also recognize that deforestation is seen as a key contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. There are also many negative social impacts from irresponsible sourcing of these ingredients. 
We see the connection between the long-term vitality of 
our business and an imperative to advance environmental and social sustainability. In addition, Campbell’s President and CEO Denise Morrison is the Vice Co-Chair of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF). The CGF member companies have agreed to mobilize their resources to help achieve zero net deforestation by 2020. As part of this commitment, Campbell has set targets to source palm oil sustainably, and to work with a range of our suppliers to drive more sustainable sourcing of other ingredients and packaging to help achieve zero net deforestation by 2020.
Palm Oil 
We are a relatively small user of palm oil, which is an 
ingredient in some of our cookie and cracker products. We understand that unsustainable harvesting of palm oil can have serious social and environmental impacts. Both Campbell and our palm oil suppliers are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a group composed of palm growers, palm oil users, retail food chains and NGOs. As a company, Campbell is working with our suppliers to ensure that the palm oil we source is derived from sustainable practices. Our commitment is to purchase 100 percent certified sustainably sourced palm oil through a combination of mass balance and segregated, where feasible, by the end of 2016. We previously committed to doing this by the end of 2015, but due to several barriers such as excessive cost and inability to secure the supply needed, we were unable to meet that timeline.
As we continue to make this shift and strive for full 
segregation of our palm oil purchases, we will also work with our suppliers, industry groups and others to provide transparency and traceability into our supply chain. For more information, please see our Palm Oil Guidelines, which include details on our commitments and milestones. 
Human Rights 
We are keenly aware of the potential for human rights 
risks within our supply chain and know that we must be proactive in assessing and addressing these risks. We will continue to perform risk assessments of our global agricultural supply chain to ensure that we are proactively addressing any potential human rights issues. For example, we partnered with Business for Social Responsibility in 2014, to analyze our agricultural supply chain, measuring the potential risk of various crops, including tomatoes, jalapeños and sweet potatoes sourced globally. Based on the potential risk indicators identified, we continue to develop a risk profile for each supplier in this area as we map out sustainability issues within our supply chain categories. Also, as part of our commitment through the CGF, Campbell is actively involved in CGF’s Social Sustainability Committee, which is focused on efforts to eradicate forced labor in the supply chain. We understand that this is an important issue and we are working to put more formal strategies in place in this area.
Animal Welfare 
We are dedicated to the humane treatment of animals 
and believe that animal welfare is an important part of our vision for a responsible supply chain. As part of our animal welfare commitments, we developed an animal welfare policy that was integrated into our annual revision of the Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual. As stakeholder expectations continue to change, we consistently evaluate necessary changes in our policies. As such, we have made specific commitments to eliminate the use of gestation crates for pigs by 2022 and to source only cage-free eggs within our supply chain by 2025. 
 
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT ProductsPRODUCTS  |  38Conflict Minerals 
Since Campbell does not use conflict minerals in the 
production of foods and beverages, we are not subject to the related disclosure requirements by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We are working with our suppliers that are subject to the SEC disclosure requirements to ensure they have appropriate policies and reporting procedures in place. To date, we have determined that about 75 percent of our packaging suppliers do not use conflict minerals, and we are continuing to evaluate the remaining 25 percent.
Supplier Diversity
We believe our suppliers should be a reflection of our diverse consumers and the markets in which we sell our products. Supplier diversity adds value to our long-term growth, strengthens our competitive advantage and has the potential to increase market share and shareholder return. We strengthen our U.S. supply base by offering diverse suppliers equal access to potential business opportunities.
In FY2015, Campbell exceeded its diversity spend goal 
with $171 million purchased from more than 250 women- and minority-owned suppliers. Since 2006, our diversity spend has increased at an average compound annual growth rate of more than 7 percent, with a spend of nearly $1.5 billion since the program inception. In our continued efforts to be more reflective of the communities we serve, we have broadened our categories of diverse suppliers to include both veteran and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) businesses. By supporting minority- and women-owned businesses, Campbell has increased our social impact on local communities by offering employment opportunities, modeling for younger generations and encouraging purchases from other diverse businesses. The business advantages from a robust supplier diversity program are clear. We’ve witnessed competitive costs and quality improvements; responsiveness and agility to adapt to changing business needs; dedicated and enhanced customer service; and fresh perspectives and new ways of thinking that promotes innovation. 
We advocate for our diverse suppliers through stakeholder 
engagement efforts, including corporate memberships and sponsorships at supplier diversity events with leading organizations such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council.

Why It Matters
The rising global population and accelerated global development and resource use require that companies implement 
holistic approaches that achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. Sustainable business models incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests. They drive corporate innovation for sustainability and help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes. Companies that adopt this approach aspire to grow their businesses while also reducing their environmental footprints. 
As one of the world’s leading manufacturers of quality food and beverages, with growers and production facilities 
around the globe, we understand the necessity of being good stewards of the environment. Reducing the resources we use and having an environmental management system in place help us to mitigate the impacts of climate change, better manage compliance, reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The risks of not doing these things can be detrimental to a manufacturing business and can impact profitability and reputation.
How We Manage
Our commitment to the environment is manifested through our sustainable business model strategies, which include understanding risks, setting goals and measuring progress against those goals. We make the biggest impact for our consumers, customers, employees and shareholders when we set and meet high goals as a business. We take a precautionary approach to the environment by seeking to apply processes or practices with less environmental impact when possible. Our primary  
2020 sustainability goal is to reduce our environmental footprint — defined as water and GHG emissions per tonne of food produced — by 50 percent. As we work Material Issue
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL
PLANET  |  43
 
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet
Our Progress
toward this goal, we’ve integrated strategies throughout 
our global business operations to ensure the widest possible impact. Our supporting 2020 goals, which track back to Campbell’s FY2008 baseline, keep us continually focused on building sustainable business models. They include: 
• Reducing energy use by 35 percent and sourcing  
40 percent of our electricity from renewable or 
alternative energy sources;
• Recycling 95 percent of waste generated globally;
• Eliminating 100 million pounds of packaging from 
Campbell products; and
• Deriving 100 percent of our global packaging 
materials from sustainable sources (renewable, 
recyclable or recycled content).
We have also continued to strengthen our Environmental Management System (EMS) in order to measure performance, ensure compliance and integrate environmental programs into our global business operations. Our EMS includes a technology platform that is used to manage compliance issues and to help us manage and measure our progress against our goals. 
Another key to a successful environmental sustainability 
strategy is to ensure that there is accountability across the entire business. This year, we evolved the way we drive sustainability strategy, performance measurement and results to clarify accountability and improve measurement and shared learning across the enterprise. We have created a Sustainability Steering Committee with key work streams and assigned leadership. This cross-functional Committee and network teams, which are co-led by the Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability and the Vice President of Global Engineering include business leaders who are accountable for setting goals and managing progress against the goals in energy, water, waste, agriculture, packaging, procurement, transportation and contract manufacturing. The network teams are also responsible for evaluating and setting both long-term and annual performance. 
Energy & Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
The food and beverage sector is one of the top five consumers of fuels and power in U.S. manufacturing, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Electricity usage and the burning of natural gas generate GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. As a corporation, we have an obligation to our employees, our customers and the environment to manage and reduce the energy that we use to produce our products. By finding efficiencies in our processes, we can reduce energy usage and the associated GHG emissions. 
To ensure we are managing energy use effectively, we 
have tracked and publicly reported on electricity and fuel use in our manufacturing facilities since 2008. Since that time, we have reduced our energy usage by 9 percent per tonne of food produced and our GHG emissions by 23 percent per tonne of food produced.
As part of our energy management strategy, this past year  
we brought online a co-generation, combined heat and 
power unit at our Toronto, Canada, manufacturing facility that satisfies 93 percent of the steam and 95 percent of the plant’s electricity needs. We are also in the process of installing a second fuel cell at our Bloomfield, Connecticut, plant that will be operational in the summer of 2016. The two fuel cells, combined with an onsite solar array also installed this past year, will generate 100 percent of the plant’s electricity demand.Our Bolthouse Farms operations have converted more than 200 diesel engines to cleaner electric power. This massive project spanned six different growing regions across the state of California and resulted in significant GHG emissions reductions. Bolthouse also achieved long-term overall cost and maintenance reductions, and can now participate in “demand-response” electricity reduction programs with the local utility provider. 
Renewable Energy
We continue to evaluate and implement renewable energy technologies at our plant locations to demonstrate the viability of these clean sources of energy and to contribute to state Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) compliance markets. 
In 2015, a new solar array came online at our Pepperidge 
Farm bakery in Bloomfield, Connecticut. In partnership with BNB Renewable Energy Holdings and SunPower Corp., the 1 megawatt solar array generates the equivalent of 15 percent of the bakery’s annual energy demand. The ground-mounted, fixed-tilt array comprises 2,720 high-  
efficiency SunPower solar panels and sits on five acres  
of land leased from Pepperidge Farm. In its first year, the array produced more than 1.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. The solar array in Bloomfield is the second largest to be installed at facilities owned by Campbell, and one of the very few solar arrays operating at a food manufacturing site in the industry. Pepperidge Farm has agreed to purchase the equivalent of 100 percent of the electricity produced by the system for 20 years. PLANET  |  44
 
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet
Waste 
Waste is generated across a business value chain: 
upstream in supplier facilities and processes, at the center in our manufacturing sites and downstream by our customers and consumers. Without efficient management practices in place, waste can have a direct impact on communities when it is discarded in landfills or leaks into waterways. Waste to landfill also generates GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. 
Fortunately, solutions for reducing waste are very 
often wins for efficiency and cost as well. Recycling and reusing materials can be a source of revenue, while reducing cost to landfill. Campbell has a long tradition of reducing food waste to landfill through recycling, reuse, food donation and sending inedible food waste to feed animals at local farms — as outlined by the EPA Food Waste Hierarchy. To build on this work, Campbell began tracking and reporting all waste and disposal methods at our plant locations in 2008. We have a goal to achieve a recycle rate across all facilities of 95 percent by 2020. This year, we increased our recycle rate to 84 percent.Water
Campbell relies on water across our value chain — in the fields that grow ingredients, in the plants where we manufacture our products and in some of our products as a primary ingredient. Maintaining a clean and sustainable supply of water is imperative to the future of both our company and the communities where we operate. We recognize the impacts of our business, and we strive to comply with all applicable legislative and regulatory requirements with respect to water quality and consumption. We also engage at vital points in our value chain to manage and reduce water consumption as outlined in our Global Water Policy. 
Water scarcity is a particular business risk in certain 
locations where the cost of business could increase due to limited water supply. Furthermore, water scarcity could impact our ability to source ingredients or to manufacture products when an adequate supply of water is not available. We proactively manage water scarcity risks by working with growers and manufacturing personnel to track water usage and increase efficient water use. 
Since 2008, Campbell has been tracking and publicly 
reporting on water usage in our manufacturing facilities, where we implement capital improvements focused on water reduction. Since 2008, our water usage has decreased by 24 percent per tonne of food produced.

Campbell’s global packaging team is committed to 
continuously improving our sustainable packaging footprint. Our packaging professionals are engaged in both short-term improvements and long-term innovation that reduce the environmental impact of our products. A global packaging sustainability program ensures that our packaging design teams are trained to incorporate environmental implications into their analysis from day one. Our three 2020 packaging goals include: 
• Eliminating 100 million pounds of packaging through 
both material selection and reduction; 
• Sourcing 100 percent of our packaging from sustainable 
materials, including renewable and recyclable materials 
and packaging made from recycled content; and 
• Engaging 100 percent of our packaging supply base 
proactively in the development of sustainable alternatives that are economically feasible, grounded in science and technology, and have sustainable end-of-life scenarios. 
To help us attain these 2020 packaging goals, Campbell follows five packaging principles that drive innovation:
• Protect: Implement packaging that delivers the safest, 
highest-quality food, while ensuring consumer and 
brand protection.
• Reduce: Continuously use packaging material and 
processes that utilize fewer resources while maintaining product quality and supply chain efficiency.
• Recycle: Utilize recyclable and recycled content in 
packaging materials whenever possible.
• Renew: Use renewable resources in packaging 
materials whenever safe and effective.
• Partner: Work with suppliers to promote clean production 
technologies and best manufacturing practices.
In FY2015, packaging efforts for Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks eliminated 316,000 pounds of raw material from our manufacturing processes. This year’s reduction was largely driven by the reduction of steel used for certain soup products and the 3 percent material reduction in Goldfish packaging. This year, we surpassed our goal by eliminating a cumulative amount of more than 112 million pounds of packaging materials since FY2009. In FY2016, we will be developing a new enterprise-wide sustainable packaging strategy. 
Logistics & Transportation
Transportation and handling of our raw materials, ingredients and finished products from farm to factory to stores presents multiple opportunities to create efficiencies. Our goals for reducing our carbon footprint are focused on reductions of our Scope 3 GHG emissions through supply chain efficiencies, which are driven by our internal optimization efforts, as well as through our third-party warehousing and transportation partners. Key initiatives include:
• Evaluating our manufacturing/sourcing footprint 
continually, to shorten the product sourcing distance 
from farm to table; 
• Optimizing our sourcing profile to reduce supply chain 
“touches,” thereby reducing the need for unnecessary product positioning;
• Improving our storage and transportation “density,” 
which enables fewer miles traveled inside and outside our Distribution Centers (DCs);
• Utilizing more environmentally friendly transportation 
methods, such as intermodal and compressed natural gas, to service our customers;
• Aligning with carriers that are utilizing higher-efficiency 
power units, with improved miles per gallon;
• Employing better DC “yard management” to reduce idle 
times and minimize unnecessary shuttle movements;
• Ensuring that all core U.S. retail carriers are EPA 
SmartWay certified;
• Improving performance on DC recycling efforts (air 
bags, plastic overwrap, corrugate, etc.);
• Reducing the potential for landfill waste through 
product damage reduction initiatives; and
• Making improvements in high-efficiency LED lighting 
(among others).

2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet
A common bumper sticker in rural areas of the U.S. reads “No farms, no food.” Agriculture is indeed the root of our 
company and products. For 147 years, Campbell has worked closely with farmers to source high-quality ingredients for our nutritious and flavorful products. 
In recent decades, the growth of the global middle class and overall global population has translated into 
unprecedented demand for agricultural products, placing increased pressure on land, water and agriculture inputs. It is material to our company to invest in the efficiency of agricultural supply chains to ensure their resilience in an often volatile global economy. 
Agricultural science also indicates that, for most food products, the farm is where many significant environmental 
impacts are incurred. Often, crop irrigation is the largest contributor to a food product’s water footprint, and fertilizer production and use is the largest contributor to its GHG footprint. In 2016, a CR materiality assessment confirmed the importance of agriculture sustainability to Campbell, with a high percentage of stakeholders indicating its relevance. Large retail customers have also identified agriculture sustainability as being of critical importance to price and supply resiliency, as well as to meeting customer expectations. Material Issue
SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
“I’ve spent a lot of time at different forums, and sustainable agriculture is the next big thing that food 
companies are working on. There’s a big shift happening. Customers and a desire for transparency are 
drivers, but as food companies we also realize that sustainability of supply reduces risk in today’s world. 
There’s a growing realization that agriculture represents the largest impact on natural systems, yet we need 
agriculture to survive. We’re starting to see a lot of organizations express an interest, for the first time, 
in improving farming practices. I see sustainability programs as a way to communicate to the world the 
progress that growers have made and the environmental benefits that come from efficiency.” 
Dr. Dan Sonke, Manager, Sustainable AgriculturePLANET  |  48Our Progress
How We Manage
Our Sustainable Agriculture Program encourages 
responsible and resilient agriculture systems to protect the long-term viability of the farms and ecosystems from which we source our ingredients. Responsible management of agricultural resources has been a hallmark of Campbell operations since our beginning. When our Sustainable Agriculture Program re-launched with a strategic emphasis in 2012, we were building upon more than 140 years of investment in agricultural research and farmer relationships. 
Today, our Sustainable Agriculture Program is guided 
by a formal strategic plan centered on tomatoes and other iconic crops in the Campbell portfolio. We take a “measure to manage” approach, in which key agriculture metrics are identified and used to provide perspective to growers about their performance. While individual farmer information is kept private, we provide farmers with a snapshot of how their metrics compare to the average performance of other Campbell suppliers who grow the same crop in the region. The perspective helps them identify strengths and opportunities for their individual fields and farms. We expect the adoption of embedded technologies and “big data” analytics to accelerate these capabilities in the future.
This is a relatively new concept for sustainable agriculture 
programs, and one in which Campbell is a key voice. We have a leading role in such industry efforts as the Stewardship Index for Specialty Crops and the Food, Beverage and Agriculture Sector Working Group of The Sustainability Consortium. Our program is also linked with Campbell Procurement and other industry-wide efforts regarding strategic ingredients such as poultry, beef, dairy and flour. In 2013, Campbell began working directly with these suppliers to communicate our strategic plan for synchronizing their sustainability efforts with our own. 
Our sustainable agriculture strategy continues to focus 
on driving improvement in five priority areas — GHG emissions, water, fertilizer and pesticide reduction, and soil quality improvements — all of which were identified through a stakeholder engagement exercise in 2012. For three of these priorities, we have set
 
2020 goals: 
• Climate: Reduce GHGs per pound of ingredient by  
20 percent
• Water: Reduce water use per unit of ingredient by  
20 percent
• Fertilizer: Reduce nitrogen applied per pound of 
ingredient by 10 percent
In addition, in August 2014, Campbell furthered its commitment to sustainable agriculture through its partnership with Walmart and announced an additional goal to reduce GHGs and water use by 20 percent per  
ton of food produced for its five key agricultural ingredients: tomatoes, carrots, celery, potatoes  
and jalapeños.
 
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet
As a business with a value chain that begins on the farm, we are acutely aware of the potential risks to the food system posed by climate change. Weather pattern changes over time can have a direct impact on many of our agricultural producers, which in turn, could significantly impact agricultural inputs to our product portfolio. Our climate strategy is integrated with our overall sustainable business strategy and encompasses sustainable agriculture, procurement, supplier engagement, performance reporting and reducing our carbon footprint. Fertilizer Optimization and  GHG Emissions Reduction
The production and use of nitrogen fertilizer is the largest contributor to GHG emissions from farming practices. Best practices and improvements in the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer use are crucial to achieving our GHG reduction goal. In tomatoes, our year-on-year data shows that nitrogen use efficiency is increasing with the adoption of best practices and technologies. Drip irrigation technology is part of the solution. At the University of California, Davis, Russell Ranch facility, scientists documented a PLANET  |  49more than 50 percent reduction per acre of the key GHG 
associated with fertilizer — nitrogen oxide — when drip irrigation was used to deliver the fertilizer close to the plant roots. This practice also increases crop yields, a financial incentive for farmers. We urge our growers to adopt drip irrigation, where economically feasible, along with nutrient management planning best practices such as soil testing and nitrogen budgeting. 
A Collaborative Partnership
Our key retail customers also understand the nitrogen opportunity. In 2013, we agreed to work with grain suppliers to improve fertilizer efficiency on 70,000 acres earmarked for Pepperidge Farm products supplied to Walmart. In 2015, we signed an agreement with SUSTAIN, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and United Suppliers — a cooperative of agriculture retail chains and crop consultants throughout the U.S. and Canada. This innovative program enlists the aid of a voice that farmers trust — their crop consultant advisers — and equips that voice with knowledge of tools and techniques for farms to implement in their cropping systems. 
This partnership expanded our fertilizer optimization 
programs in sourcing areas of Ohio and Nebraska that provide wheat to Pepperidge Farm. We plan to enroll an additional 70,000 acres into our fertilizer optimization programs by 2020. The project aims to improve water quality and reduce GHG emissions by optimizing fertilizer use and advancing soil conservation for farmers in our wheat and corn sourcing areas. 
SUSTAIN is part of EDF’s Sustainable Sourcing Initiative 
to enable Campbell, along with industry peers, to do  
our part to make fertilizer efficiency and soil health the norm in U.S. grain production. EDF is a leading developer of reporting systems to track and measure both the environmental and economic benefits of fertilization optimization and conducts on-farm trials of fertilizer optimization tools to make sure farmers are using the best tools available.
Efficient use of inputs such as fertilizer also has positive 
business implications for our growers. It helps reduce the likelihood of regulatory impacts, which can negatively affect cost or production for their operations. Preventive adoption of best practices also enhances our growers’ efficiency, as well as reducing cost and improving yields in many cases. 
Water and GHG Reductions
We have made progress in each of our priority areas, particularly water consumption. In FY2015, we reduced our agricultural water use (gal/lb raw tomato) by 18 percent and produced 12 percent fewer fertilizer-related GHG emissions per ton of tomato, measured year over year. Based on data collected in 2015, we know the typical Campbell farmer needs approximately 8.5 gallons of water for every pound of tomatoes produced, which is in line with other irrigated fruits and vegetables. But there’s still room for improvement. To reach our 2020 goal, we’re working directly with contract farms to develop more sustainable irrigation practices.
Water and fertilizer continue to be major priorities for 
our key stakeholders, with fertilizer a key contributor  to GHG footprints as well as water-quality impacts. As recent droughts have demonstrated, restrictions on water availability for irrigation significantly impact what crops farmers can grow and where they can grow them. Campbell has been able to manage through drought conditions successfully due to close working relationships with farmers, through the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies and practices, and through a small amount of shifting volume among sourcing regions. 
Drip irrigation, for example, is one of the most efficient 
methods of watering crops because drip-irrigated tomato fields typically use about 40 percent less water

number of Campbell growers using drip irrigation has almost doubled in the last five years, with 60 percent of Campbell’s tomato acres currently using this type of irrigation. Using our 2012 baseline data, we are seeking to increase that number by identifying drip-irrigation opportunities across geographies. By showing individual growers how their water use compares to local/state averages, we ultimately want to help them move toward more efficient irrigation practices. 
In 2014 and 2015, some of our tomato farmers and our carrot-
growing operations at Bolthouse Farms were able to secure drought grant funding from the state of California to implement water-saving technologies, while also reducing GHG emissions. Bolthouse Farms has also been piloting improved irrigation techniques on certain farms, which has reduced water use on those pilot farms by 20 percent. 
After two years of working primarily in tomatoes, we pledged in 
2014 to expand our climate and water goals to four additional key vegetables: carrots, potatoes, celery and jalapeños. As a result, we now have data to set a baseline in these vegetables and are exploring collaborations to identify opportunities. For example, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in New Jersey will be working with Campbell vegetable growers in that state in 2016 to assess conservation practices appropriate to each farm.
Our focus on water extends to our agriculture processing plants 
as well. For example, our tomato processing plants in Dixon and Stockton, California, reduced freshwater pumped per ton of tomatoes processed by 35 percent in FY2015 as compared to a 2010 baseline. The plants track performance daily throughout each harvest season. During the off season, learnings from harvest are built into improvement plans to be implemented during the following harvest. 
As a proactive employer and neighbor, these actions began even 
before it was clear California had entered its most recent drought.
Pesticide Use 
Reducing pests and disease helps create healthier crops and increases yields, but the industry’s traditional control methods have often depended on pesticides. Today’s sustainable pest and disease management, however, is achievable through a focus on prevention and by employing a variety of coordinated methods, collectively known as integrated pest management (IPM). 
Pesticide reduction is an area where Campbell has historically 
been a leader. Though an effective IPM program will generally utilize pesticides to some degree, Campbell works with growers to ensure that prevention practices are the first line of defense. 
To enhance our IPM efforts, each year, Campbell agriculture 
experts work to add more disease-resistant tomato varieties to our agriculture program, with the goal of creating traditionally bred plant varieties that allow farmers to increase yields while reducing or eliminating the need for pesticides.

How We Manage
Why It Matters
Ethical business practices are essential to the long-term success of a company. Strong business ethics set the tone 
for the culture of an organization and provide guidance for employees in making decisions that are beneficial to themselves and to the organization. At Campbell, we understand that having a foundation of ethical business practices creates positive impacts on the company and allows us to attract and retain the type of talented employees who share our values. Setting this foundation also reduces many risks that companies today face, including being fined for poor behavior or experiencing damage to their reputation, one of a company’s most valuable assets that can be difficult to rebuild. At Campbell, we pride ourselves on the reputation we have built and in providing our employees with an ethical workplace where they are proud to work.
Campbell’s compliance and ethics program, known as Winning With Integrity, reflects our conviction that conducting business in compliance with the law and the highest standards of business ethics is essential to our success. As reflected in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (The Code), the foundation document of our program, employees share responsibility for ensuring that the Winning With Integrity principles are fulfilled every day, through each and every action taken — whether in the marketplace, the workplace or the community. The Winning With Integrity program equips our employees with the resources, tools and guidance to help build a better Campbell.
The Code outlines our company’s basic standards 
and expectations, highlights important policies and summarizes certain fundamental legal requirements that our employees must follow. Each new employee receives a copy of the Code, which is available in multiple languages. In FY2013, we updated the entire Material Issue

Policy and Human Rights Principles, are reviewed and revised, as necessary, each year. New policies are periodically issued and disseminated as circumstances warrant. A central Index of Standards and Procedures for Compliance, maintained by the legal department, provides a comprehensive inventory of the policies, procedures and guidelines in use at the corporate level and within the individual businesses and functions. Similarly, a companion Index of Mechanisms for Monitoring and Auditing Compliance is maintained by the legal department to confirm responsibility for ascertaining that the policies and procedures are being followed. Both of these indices are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, including review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Integrity Hotline
Campbell’s Integrity Hotline enables complaints, concerns and questions to be raised with the company or the Board of Directors on a confidential and/or anonymous basis. Hotline access is available through a secure Internet 
website and toll-free from all countries where Campbell has operations. The availability of this Hotline is widely publicized, and all reports are thoroughly investigated.Code and included new sections on expense reporting 
and personal and familial workplace relationships. The updated version was approved by the CEO and the Board of Directors, announced and distributed to employees in their language of choice and posted on the company’s internal and external websites.
In FY2014, we integrated our acquisitions, Plum and 
Kelsen into the Winning With Integrity program and did the same with Garden Fresh Gourmet in FY2016.
Campbell’s legal department is responsible for 
maintaining and administering the Winning With Integrity program. The Vice President — Corporate Compliance/Deputy General Counsel has overall responsibility for the direction and administration of the program and has direct access to the Chair of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for all compliance-related matters.

These and other training and development opportunities are discussed between managers and employees around the world as part of annual performance reviews. This review process also factors in individual development plans, which are customized around each employee’s career experiences, skills, interests and aspirations. 
Employee Engagement
To support our move to a high-performance organization, we realized the need to implement a more comprehensive tool that measures not only engagement, but also our organization’s levels of performance excellence in key areas. In 2012, we began measuring this performance through the annual Drive Survey. The results of the Drive Survey are used to guide top-level changes in support of our strategic priorities and to further develop our high-performance culture. Manager excellence is a key driver in a high-performing organization, and we survey our global salaried population twice per year on manager excellence topics. We also leverage this survey to measure other key strategic initiatives like customer orientation and company Purpose. Our continuous improvement process also includes a survey of the Campbell employees every other year. This is especially important in the integration of new acquisitions so that we are capturing feedback holistically.Rewarding Performance
High-performing people create high-performing organizations. We drive individual high performance by assessing our employees based on their contributions to the business, not just tasks completed. We incentivize strong performance results through ongoing programs designed to help advance their careers, maximize their contributions within their roles and develop the requisite skills to perform more effectively. 
Peer recognition is also an important part of building a 
high-performance culture. Campbell has a number of employee recognition programs at both the local and global levels that are designed to identify and reward employees whose contributions and actions make a difference. One such program is our Make a Difference Awards. This unique online recognition program allows our employees to formally thank another employee for making a difference at any time of the year. The recipients of MAD awards receive a gift card and a certificate to display in their workspace.

2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT People
The past year was one of growth for Campbell’s 
commitment to WD&I. We took significant enterprise-wide steps to further integrate diversity and inclusion as a business imperative. Highlights include launching:
• Our newest employee affinity group called Roots, 
aimed at engaging Campbell employees on real food 
and sustainability;• The Real Series, focused on engagement and retention 
of black talent; and
• The eRecipe book, published by our Norwalk-based 
BRANs and the OPEN network’s New York and Philadelphia Pride partnerships, to connect consumers with our products. To better meet the needs of America’s increasingly diverse population, our workforce should mirror the increasing diversity of our consumers. We keep our finger on the pulse of diversity trends in the marketplace in order to help us create an authentic connection with our current and future employees. According to the most recent U.S. Census, ethnic groups will account for 85 percent of the population growth through 2050. In today’s workforce, 40 percent are women, 20 percent are people with disabilities and 10 percent are people who identify as LGBT. 
Understanding how to adapt our business to this changing consumer landscape, and adapting our Workforce 
Diversity & Inclusion (WD&I) strategy accordingly, is critical to our ability to achieve high performance and fulfill our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments. We continue to concentrate on cultivating leadership and employee capabilities and awareness around diversity and inclusion, while enriching our culture and employee engagement through our Business Resource Affinity Networks (BRANs).Material Issue
DIVERSITY & INCLUSION
PEOPLE  |  61Our Progress
 
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT People
Building on the momentum of 2015, we are well 
positioned to accelerate our journey toward a more authentic culture of diversity and inclusion. To drive continuous improvement, we conducted a strategy refresh in FY2015. Moving forward, WD&I will be focused on three key drivers of success:
• 
 Driving high perf
ormance by ensuring leaders and 
employees understand the connection between WD&I 
and high performance, and by equipping them with the information, tools and vehicles to personally activate their commitment.• 
  P ositioning inclusion as our strategic differentiator 
through support of leadership and management in leveraging the diversity of the talents, perspectives and skills that our increasingly dynamic workforce brings to the table at Campbell.
• 
 Incr
easing visible and measureable accountability by 
improving how we track and analyze WD&I data to more effectively drive strategy and elevate enterprise accountability by clearly articulating goals and metrics. 
By attracting and retaining talent reflective of our consumers and transforming our culture into our Greatness Agenda, Campbell enabled leaders and employees to unite in several key growth areas. These include Positioning for Growth; Building Awareness and Adaptability; Engaging Leaders’ Talent; and Creating Community.
Positioning for Growth
We have integrated WD&I into the Global Talent Management Center of Excellence, helping to build synergies, increase efficiencies and eliminate silos across the enterprise. These enhanced collaborations, centered on attracting talent (sourcing and recruiter training), manager empowerment and engagement (toolkits and key messages) and talent growth and retention (development programs for high-performing team members) and resulted in positive results in FY2015. 
Building Awareness & Capability 
Creating a culture of inclusion does not happen overnight. We are investing in teaching our employees about their unconscious biases and increasing their levels of self-awareness in order to change behavior. In FY2015, we launched a new development program, Inclusive Leadership: Discovering Unconscious Bias, designed to help employees appreciate the increasing diversity of our workforce and leverage the richness of our differences. Leadership and human resources professionals received this training initially. Based on the positive results, we are rolling out the program to additional groups of employees in 2016.Engaging Leaders, Talent & Creating Community
We drive leadership and management engagement and accountability through a variety of touch points. These include biannual WD&I-focused leadership meetings, constant coordination with human resources leadership and trickle-down communication of key diversity and inclusion messages from enterprise leadership. 
Fostering Future Women & Minority Leaders
Looking to ensure the next generation of Campbell leaders, we invited 30 students from Camden Academy Charter High School to our World Headquarters in FY2015 as part of the second annual global STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) Career Accelerator Day. STEM Career Accelerator Day 2015 aimed to expose and excite 10,000 students in grades eight through 12 to engage with STEM careers through an experiential visit and interaction with professionals. 
A particular focus for the global program is to engage 
young women and students from minority backgrounds to consider STEM careers. This a unique opportunity to not only engage and inspire students who have an interest in STEM, but also to allow Campbell, as an employer, the opportunity to help frame the curriculum and develop the skills needed for future STEM roles and potential future candidates. 
As an advocate for mentoring future women leaders  
in business, in FY2015 we hosted the official launch of Women of the Dream, a nonprofit organization focused on developing African-American girls to help them achieve careers and healthy, productive lifestyles through workshops, mentoring, networking and scholarships. The program has the potential to make a profound impact in our hometown of Camden for the next generation of women. PEOPLE  |  62Business Resource Affinity  
Networks (BRANs)
Our BRANs are employee-led, company-supported volunteer organizations that help us focus and connect with our increasingly diverse employee and consumer bases. We rely heavily on our nine BRANs as pathways to leverage talent and increase cultural curiosity, sensitivity and connection. By leveraging our BRAN leadership positions as stretch assignments to grow capability and increase visibility of high-performing talent, we get the best of multiple worlds: inspired leadership from passionate employees, innovative development opportunities and grassroots-level role models who motivate peers and leaders alike. Our networks currently include:
Asian Network of Campbell (ANC): Focuses on Asian employee and professional development
Black Resource Group (BRG): Works to 
attract, retain and empower top black talent
Bridge Network: Fosters trust and 
collaboration across generations
Campbell Administrative Professionals 
(CAPs): Enhances organizational vitality and promotes excellence among administrative employees

employees at our Maxton manufacturing facility

to add value through LGBT initiatives
Roots: Inspires employees to bring our 
Purpose to life by exciting the Campbell community around real food and sustainabilityWomen of Campbell (WoC): Strives to help  
Campbell women achieve and demonstrate their full potential
Board Gender Diversity
It is important that our Board of Directors reflects the diversity of our marketplace. In 2015, we were honored by two leading organizations focused on advancing women’s leadership, the Women’s Forum of New York and the Executive Women of New Jersey (EWNJ). At their Breakfast of Corporate Champions, the Women’s Forum of New York named Campbell a “corporate game changer” for having at least 20 percent female representation on its Board of Directors. EWNJ recognized Campbell with the Corporate Board Gender Diversity Award, which acknowledges publicly held companies in New Jersey who have at least three women on their boards. Currently, four females sit on Campbell’s 12-member Board, including one executive.
Legacy of LGBT Advocacy 
Ensuring and respecting diversity and creating an inclusive workplace will continue to be key to unlocking our potential. In 2015, we received a perfect score for the seventh year on the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation’s annual Corporate Equality Index, were designated as a Best Place to Work for LGBT Equality and earned a spot on the HRC’s 2016 Buying Guide for Equality — a guide to businesses, products and services that support LGBT equality. These awards are evidence of our commitment to being one of the nation’s top places where employees can confidently bring their whole selves to work. 
The Financial Times, in partnership with OUTstanding, 
an LGBT network for business leaders and allies, named Campbell’s Bethmara Kessler, Vice President of Corporate Audit, to the Top 100 Leading LGBT Executives, with Kessler being ranked 59th. To be named to the OUTstanding Top 100, each nominee was judged by the following criteria: activities undertaken to make the workplace a more welcoming place; activities a nominee is involved with outside of the workplace that help to achieve positive change for LGBT people; recent business achievements; and seniority and influence in the business. Kessler also serves as the Business Advisor for Campbell’s OPEN network.
 “As the first woman to lead Campbell in our 145-year history, I feel that I have 
a responsibility to serve as a role model and mentor for young women and 
help them open doors of opportunity. I want all of you [student mentees] 
to know that the women in this room stand with you as you begin a journey 
that can change your lives and help set you on the path to a fulfilling and 
rewarding life. We’re here to help you soar!”

2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT People
Campbell takes an active approach toward ensuring 
that its employees are provided with a safe and healthy working environment. A decade ago, Campbell created the Global Safety Leadership Team to develop and implement our Global Safety Strategic Plan. The plan aims to reduce injuries across Campbell and to deliver world-class safety results. Our Safety Leadership Team establishes direction and provides leadership in executing the plan, which includes:•
 T he development and implementation of global 
safety standards, including technology and online tools that help communicate safety measures clearly and consistently to our global workforce;
•
 Annual r
egional safety conferences to share best 
practices and develop local safety teams; 
•
 Annually c
onducting three-day safety audits at our 
manufacturing locations, focusing on programs, conditions and behaviors; andNo matter the type of business, all organizations understand that there is the possibility of a workplace accident. Employees are exposed to a variety of hazards, from dangerous machinery to stress. There are various reasons why having effective workplace health and safety systems in place is important. Ensuring a safe work environment reduces costs associated with lost-time injuries, ensures legal requirements are met and provides employees with a workplace culture that respects and protects their well-being. Ensuring the health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and it goes beyond social responsibility — it also makes good business sense. Material Issue
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY
PEOPLE  |  66Our Progress
Safety Results
Campbell’s safety focus has allowed us to exceed 
industry benchmarks for several years. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor, through 2012 our industry averaged 1.1 lost-time incidents for every 200,000 hours worked. In FY2015, however, Campbell’s rate was only 0.29. In addition, Campbell’s occupational injury and illness frequency rate per 200,000 hours was 1.95 in FY2015, whereas the industry average for the 2012 data year was 5.4.
Recognizing Safety Achievements
Beyond tracking and improving injury and illness rates, Campbell recognizes employees and teams when they reach important safety milestones. Our Safety Flag Program recognizes Campbell facilities where safety systems have kept employees free of lost-time injuries for at least one year, or more than one million work hours. Today, eight of Campbell’s 25 manufacturing sites proudly fly the Safety Flag, many with gold Campbell “C”s added for reaching additional million-hour milestones. Additionally, Campbell’s Global Safety Excellence Award recognizes up to four Campbell facilities each year for their ongoing efforts to ingrain workplace safety into their cultures. Plants are evaluated based on a number of criteria, and the winning facilities are recognized each year in June as part of National Safety Month. The FY2015 winning plant was Maxton, North Carolina.•
 Saf
ety recognition at Global Leadership Team 
meetings and through our global Greatness Awards.
To ensure safety in the workplace, our employees must be fully engaged and trained in appropriate safety procedures. Safety systems are embedded into manufacturing plant operations through employee engagement initiatives, safety training and procedures, such as our Daily Direction Setting (DDS) process. Each region within the Campbell organization conducts an annual health and safety conference to build awareness and strengthen the ties between operational safety and workplace wellness.

We have developed two goals that support this focused 
lens. By 2020, Campbell is committed to measurably improving the health of young people in our hometown communities by reducing childhood obesity and hunger by 50 percent. In addition, we seek to make a positive impact on the lives of 100 million youth through our volunteer, community and signature programs.In our effort to help our local communities thrive, Campbell utilizes four strategic approaches in our community efforts:
• Social impact;
• Innovation;• Employee engagement; and• Strategic investment and in-kind giving.What we do every day matters. At Campbell, we believe we have a fundamental responsibility to help our local 
communities thrive. Investing in our community and supporting our neighbors matters to us as a company, it matters to our employees and it matters to the people who are the fabric of the communities where we live and work. It is this commitment and our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments, that guides our community efforts. 
Our Purpose is based on a set of unwavering beliefs. The first of which is we believe food should be delicious, 
accessible and affordable — all three — without compromise. As a food company, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our capabilities and expertise to increase food access in communities where we have operations, and we center our community efforts on this issue.Material Issue
COMMUNITY IMPACT & FOOD ACCESS
PEOPLE  |  68Our Progress
 
2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT People
We believe real change is not just in philanthropic giving, 
but in the power of combining financial investments with the passion and skills of our employees, our capabilities as a food company, and the commitment and engagement of local community leaders and organizations. Together, we are driving innovation in food access and in local community issues where we have operations. 
Social Impact
Access to fresh, nutritious and affordable food is a hallmark of our social impact program, Campbell’s Healthy Communities, which operates in our hometown communities to address issues of food security, nutrition education, health and well-being. Camden, New Jersey, a town of 77,000 residents and home of Campbell’s World Headquarters, has only one full-service grocery store and was our initial focus. This $10 million, 10-year initiative is directed toward measurably improving the health of young people in our hometown communities. In the past five years, the effort has expanded its footprint from Camden to Norwalk, Connecticut, home  
of Pepperidge Farm headquarters, in addition to Napoleon, Ohio, and Everett, Washington, sites of two  
of our manufacturing facilities.
Campbell’s Healthy Communities is focused on four key 
areas — food access, physical activity and access, nutrition education and public will. The core of the program is in the collective impact approach. In Camden, 11 investee organizations work together on a common agenda with shared measurement systems, mutually reinforcing activities and continuous communication. This approach is reinforced by a leadership organization which drives the work and creates long-term sustainability for the program.
We understand that food access and nutrition education 
are only two pieces of the complicated health puzzle. By increasing access to physical activity programs and combining those efforts with healthy eating, Campbell’s Healthy Communities program participants are seeing measurable differences in their BMI percentiles. An example is Camden’s Soccer for Success program, which operates 15 sites with nearly 700 participants each year. In 2015, 57 percent of Soccer for Success participants lost up to 30 BMI percentile points. 
We view Campbell’s Healthy Communities as more than 
just a social impact program — it is all about the innovative approach to making lasting change in our local communities. We don’t have all the answers, and not every initiative we have tried has worked. What is unique about the program is its ability to learn from failure and, most importantly, course-correct with the input and guidance of our program sites and community partners. As we learn, we share our structure and changes with our newest Campbell’s Healthy Communities  
locations, enabling them to become champions of change in measurably improving the health of young people in our hometown communities.

PEOPLE  |  69Innovation
For Campbell, innovation is the key to success, both in 
our business as a food company and in our work as a corporate citizen. As we strive to create healthy communities and make nutritious food available to those  
in need, we must think outside the can. Campbell has been doing just that through reimagining the traditional school bake sale and through the creation of produce-  
to-donate products such as Just Peachy salsa and Plum’s Super Smoothie.
The UnBake Sale
When the new Smart Snacks in Schools nutrition 
standards took effect in July 2014 as part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, the traditional school bake sale of sweets was suddenly obsolete. In response, Bolthouse Farms developed the UnBake Sale, a fundraiser featuring better-for-you fun and delicious snacks made of fruits and vegetables.
Bolthouse Farms initiated the UnBake Sale by 
encouraging schools to sign the “100 School Pledge” on www.theunbakesale.com. The website features a toolkit with recipes for healthy snack items, printable promotional items and a checklist to get started on hosting an UnBake sale fundraiser. Healthy snacks include irresistible apple and grape turtles, raspberry and blueberry caterpillars, and banana and strawberry bunnies.Just Peachy
What do you get when you combine a growing  
food insecure population in southern New Jersey,  
an increased demand for services at the Food Bank  
of South Jersey, passionate Campbell employees and excess but nutritionally sound peaches headed for landfill? Just Peachy salsa, of course.
Developed in 2012, Just Peachy salsa utilizes some  
of the 800,000 pounds of peaches thrown away each 
year (due to being undersized or slightly blemished) by just one farmer’s cooperative in southern New Jersey. When the Food Bank of South Jersey had an idea to create a shelf-stable product to sell at retail,  a team of Campbell volunteers jumped right in. They developed the recipe and manufacturing process and even got 12 Campbell suppliers to donate packaging and ingredients. In addition, Campbell employees volunteered to box the salsa to ready it for distribution.
In the four years since the creation of Just Peachy, the 
Food Bank of South Jersey has grossed more than $250,000 in revenue that supports its nine hunger relief programs. The product is sold at 25 southern New Jersey retail outlets, including farmer’s markets, restaurants and select ShopRite stores. 
The Full Effect
Plum was founded on the belief that every child 
deserves the very best food from the very first bite. More than 16 million children in the U.S., or one in five, are food insecure and don’t have access to regular meals. Not only that, but it is recognized that ages  0 to 3 are the most critical years developmentally for children. Plum launched The Full Effect in 2013 — a produce-to-donate initiative dedicated to nourishing little ones in need throughout the U.S. The Full Effect name comes from the fundamental belief that when little ones are full of the right nutrients, they can live up to their full potential and have their full effect on the world. 
One of the signature initiatives of The Full Effect is a 
Super Smoothie pouch made with accessible organic superfoods, including fruits, vegetables and grains, that help fortify the diets of kids who don’t get regular healthy meals. In 2014, Plum launched the Super Smoothie as a buy-give product at retail — for every four-pack purchased, a Super Smoothie was donated to a little one in need.
With the help of Plum’s supply chain and nonprofit 
partners, the company donated more than 700,000 Super Smoothies in FY2015. Donations of Super Smoothie and other Plum products reach children  
in need across the country through a small group  
of extraordinary nonprofit partners, including Conscious Alliance, Convoy of Hope and the Homeless Prenatal Program.

FY2015 EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT HIGHLIGHTS
PEOPLE  |  70Employee Engagement
At Campbell, our people are at the core of what we do. In 
our effort to drive community work that matters, we rely on the skills and passion of our employees. Volunteerism occurs year-round at Campbell, with more than 14,100 U.S. volunteer hours tracked in FY2015. These efforts are supported by Dollars for Doers, a program that recognizes and encourages employee volunteerism. For every 25 hours an employee volunteers, the partner nonprofit receives a $500 grant. In FY2015, 101 Dollars for Doers grants were awarded totaling $169,500. 
During Campbell’s annual week of service, Make a 
Difference Week, employees from across the company come together to help our local communities thrive. In FY2015, more than 2,500 Campbell employees from across 14 locations in the U.S. participated in 109 projects focused on building healthy communities and driving food access. Some of those projects are profiled below.Focused, year-round volunteering takes place with Feeding America, its member food banks and affiliated agencies. In most areas where Campbell has a facility, we’ve established a steady volunteer partnership with the local Feeding America food bank — sorting and boxing food, leading cooking and nutrition classes and even providing capacity-building support through board service. In FY2015, nearly 25 percent of Campbell’s total volunteer hours were dedicated to Feeding America food banks and their member agencies.
Strategic Investment & In-Kind Giving
At Campbell, we believe that impact is generated, not simply by giving grants, but also by strategic investment in long-term partnerships in focused priority areas. In FY2015, the Campbell Soup Foundation launched the Campbell Healthy Communities Impact Award program to award and recognize public/private partnerships in our manufacturing plant communities that were advancing 
In Camden, New Jersey, volunteers planted fruit trees and cold weather vegetables in community gardens with the NJ Tree Foundation, prepared meals for 400 homeless patrons at New Visions Homeless Day Shelter and built raised garden beds for the Salvation Army. 
In Norwalk, Connecticut, 300 Pepperidge Farm employees 
sorted food and built shelving systems for the Connecticut Food Bank. 
Across 13 manufacturing facilities, employees packed and 
donated 2,060 backpacks full of food to youth in need. These youth participate in the National School Lunch program during the school week, but do not know where their next meal is coming from on the weekend.
In San Francisco, California, Plum employees prepared and 
served meals to seniors and critically ill neighbors through Project Open Hand.

In Australia, the employee-funded Arnott’s Foundation focuses its giving on creating positive environments and healthy communities that allow Australian families to build, maintain and enjoy a better quality of life. The main beneficiary of the Arnott’s Foundation is Camp Quality, which provides support to the families of children diagnosed with cancer. In FY2015, the Arnott’s Foundation provided AU$574,000 to Camp Quality, which funded the Family Camp Program benefiting hundreds of Australian families. This total represented a 34 percent increase in employee donations over FY2014.In the U.S., Campbell is the largest contributor to the United Way in many of the communities where we have operations. Support of the United Way and its work is high, with participation rates topping 98 percent in our Camden, New Jersey, World Headquarters in FY2015. Overall, 13 Campbell and Pepperidge Farm locations hosted giving campaigns last year, with employee contributions totaling $1.11 million. Coupled with a match from the Campbell Soup Foundation, United Way organizations across the country received almost $1.68 million to support its focus areas of education, income and health, including bridging the food access gap for those who need it most.
In-Kind Giving
As a food company, our products are one of our greatest 
assets. Partnering with organizations like Feeding America, Campbell donates more than $50 million in in-kind product annually through direct agency donations and reclamation. Providing access to our nourishing food, especially to those who need it most, is one critical way we help our local communities thrive. 
Campbell Canada continued its multiyear commitment 
with Food Banks Canada in FY2015, providing more than 2 million pounds of food to support food-insecure Canadian families.

2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Reporting
This is Campbell Soup Company’s 8th annual Corporate 
Responsibility Report. In this report, we strive to provide our stakeholders with a balanced view of our corporate responsibility strategy and performance in our worldwide operations during fiscal year 2015 (ended August 2, 2015). This report includes content on our key material issues and an update to key performance metrics, including progress against our 2020 goals. Our previous report was published in 2015. Significant policy or program advances and recognition occurring before or after FY2015 may also be included.
In preparing this report, we used the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, including the Food Processing Sector Supplement. This report exceeds the disclosures necessary to meet the core-  
level reporting requirements, including some content that addresses comprehensive-level disclosures. Please see our GRI Index for more details and www.globalreporting.org  
to learn more about the GRI framework. 
This Campbell CR Report covers our owned and leased 
facilities on a global basis where we have operational control. Unless otherwise stated, principles and policies referenced in the report apply to locations operated worldwide, and to all employees of Campbell Soup Company. Bolthouse Farms was acquired in August 2012. Plum was acquired in June 2013, and Campbell worked with Plum to incorporate it as a Public Benefit Corporation (Plum, PBC) under Delaware law in August 2013. Kelsen was acquired in August 2013. This year, we made progress in incorporating these acquisitions into many of our reported metrics. Garden Fresh Gourmet was acquired in June 2015, and we will work to incorporate their performance in the next update of the CR Report. This year, our environmental data was restated back to the base year of 2008 to include the Bolthouse Farms, Plum and Kelsen acquisitions. The metrics and goals in this report are established and measured by the Campbell business units and corporate functions that are responsible for achieving them. This is done in consultation with internal and,  
in some cases, external stakeholders, as well as by reference to external benchmarks and leadership practices. Our goal is to deliver a useful and accurate description of our performance. Given our rapidly changing business, the number of acquisitions and divestitures, and the limited data from the acquired acquisitions, we are currently working to reevaluate some of our long-term performance goals and anticipate doing that in the next year. 
Last year, we successfully completed a third-party 
limited assurance review consistent with guidance provided by ISO 14064-3 of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory. This assurance process was under the supervision of the Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability. We did not complete third-party assurance of other sections of the Report.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Environmental
Energy & Emissions
Does the company have short-term goals related to 
energy reduction?Yes. In addition to our 10-year goal to cut our environmental footprint in half by 2020 — defined as water used and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per tonne of our food produced — we have a short-term goal to reduce our energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 2 percent annually. 
What is the percentage of energy used that is derived 
from renewable sources?6 percent.
What is the percentage of energy used that is derived 
from non-renewable sources?94 percent.
What is the amount of energy used that is derived from 
renewable sources at any other level than enterprise (including facility, business unit, region, etc.)?Approximately 85 percent of the electricity used at our Napoleon, Ohio, facility is sourced from the grid, of which 9 percent is renewable energy, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Does the company utilize carbon offsets?
Yes. Plum purchases carbon offsets in the amount  
of the GHG emissions from the energy used in its headquarters building in Emeryville, California.
Does the company purchase any carbon credits?
Yes. Campbell and Bolthouse Farms plants in California purchase carbon credits to be in compliance with the Air Resources Board Cap-and-Trade Program. Does the company use carbon sequestration/capture?No.

What are the company’s methane emissions from 
direct sources?186 tonnes of CO2e. 
Does the company have a commitment to reducing its 
HCFC/CDC CFC emissions?For our refrigeration systems, Campbell uses both natural refrigerants and synthetics. Our primary refrigeration needs involve process cooling, product/ingredient storage coolers, freezers and comfort cooling. The company has begun a phase-out program of HFCs. This is consistent with our commitment to the Consumer Goods Forum resolution for eliminating HFCs due to the associated GHG emissions. CFCs and HCFCs are being phased out in accordance with the Montreal Protocol. As our HFCs and HCFCs systems require replacement, they will be replaced with natural refrigerants or alternative solutions with an equivalent GWP less than 10, in markets where it is legally allowed, commercially viable and technically feasible with safe operation assured.
The company is in the process of removing HFC and 
HCFC refrigerants, which are mainly found in our bakery operations. Three bakeries in the U.S. have been converted to ammonia refrigerant-based systems. The company has plans to convert our remaining five U.S. bakeries and three Australian bakeries. One of those facilities will be converted by 2017 and the remaining by 2020. 
Does the company tie incentives to energy and/or 
emissions conservation goals?Yes, the company’s annual incentive plan includes emissions reduction goals.Campbell is committed to helping our external stakeholders learn more about our corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts. To support this effort to be more transparent, we have compiled environmental, social and governance information that is frequently requested by many of our stakeholders.

Genetically Modified Ingredients
What is the company’s position on genetically 
modified (GMO) ingredients?In January 2016, Campbell updated its position on GMO ingredients.  Please see the company’s press release, which is reiterated below:
• Campbell Soup Company (NYSE: CPB) today announced 
its support for the enactment of federal legislation to 
establish a single mandatory labeling standard for foods derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
• Campbell believes it is necessary for the federal 
government to provide a national standard for labeling requirements to better inform consumers about this issue. The company will advocate for federal legislation that would require all foods and beverages regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to be clearly and simply labeled for GMOs. Campbell is also supportive of a national standard for non-GMO claims made on food packaging.
• As a result of its decision to support mandatory national 
GMO labeling, Campbell will withdraw from all efforts led by coalitions and groups opposing such measures.
• The company continues to oppose a patchwork of 
state-by-state labeling laws, which it believes are incomplete, impractical and create unnecessary confusion for consumers.
• Campbell is optimistic a federal solution can be 
established in a reasonable amount of time if all the interested stakeholders cooperate. However, if that is not the case, Campbell is prepared to label all of its U.S. products for the presence of ingredients that were derived from GMOs, not just those required by pending legislation in Vermont. The company would seek guidance from the FDA and approval by USDA.
• Campbell continues to recognize that GMOs are safe, 
as the science indicates that foods derived from crops grown using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. The company also believes technology will play a crucial role in feeding the world.• Campbell has been engaged in the conversation about 
GMO labeling for several years and has taken action to provide consumers with more information about how its products are made, including the presence of GMOs, through efforts like its website www.whatsinmyfood.com. With 92 percent of Americans supporting the labeling of GMO foods, Campbell believes now is the time for the federal government to act quickly to implement a federal solution.

decision can be found on Campbell’s newsroom.
Public Policy
Does the company actively participate in the 
discussion of local, state, national and international public policy issues?Yes. We engage in issues that are relevant to our business strategies and operations, from food safety and advertising to health care and international trade. We also contribute to public dialogue on policy issues through our memberships in food and related industry trade associations. Committed to industry-wide transparency, we emphasize candid dialogue and open interactions with government agencies and officials.
Does the company have policies for political engagement 
and does it disclose political contributions?Yes, Campbell is recognized as a leader in political accountability. Campbell’s U.S. lobbying disclosure reports are filed with the appropriate state and federal authorities under the U.S. Lobby Disclosure Act. We also file disclosure reports with the Election Law Enforcement Commission for lobbying activity with the State of New Jersey.

Bolthouse Farms was acquired in August 2012, Plum in June 2013, Kelsen in August 2013 and Garden Fresh Gourmet in June 2015. Campbell divested its European simple meals business in October 2013. As a result of these changes in the Campbell portfolio, and in accordance with the guidance from the WRI WBCSD GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, we removed the divested European business from our environmental data back to our baseyear in last year’s report.

In 2016, we elected to change our method of accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans and the calculation of expected return on pension plan assets. Historically, actuarial gains and losses associated with benefit obligations were recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were amortized into earnings over the remaining service life of participants to the extent that the amounts were in excess of a corridor. Under the new policy, gains and losses will be recognized immediately in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. In addition, we will no longer use a market-related value of plan assets, which is an average value, to determine the expected return on assets but rather will use the fair value of plan assets.
