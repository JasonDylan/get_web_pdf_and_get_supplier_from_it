SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011contents
Welcome to the latest Sustainable 
Development Report from Gazprom Neft. 
Our Company has published Sustainable 
Development Reports concurrently 
with Annual Reports each year since 
2008. The purpose of the Reports is to 
improve transparency by complementing 
information on our operational and 
financial performance with an insight into 
the principles and practices which we 
use to address social and environmental 
issues, and into implementation by our 
Company of its social responsibilities. The Report provides information about 
Gazprom Neft, its subsidiaries and associ -
ates (‘Gazprom Neft’, ‘the Company’, or 
‘the Group’) for the 2011 calendar year. 
The Report presents our Company’s financial 
situation and operating results based on 
consolidated data. The Report draws on 
management and audited financial accounts 
of JSC Gazprom Neft compiled using Russian 
Accounting and US GAAP standards. Data on 
the Company’s social and labour relations 
and its environmental protection activities 
comprise Gazprom Neft, its subsidiaries and 
its associates based in Russia and in the CIS 
countries, unless otherwise indicated. 
The data were gathered and organised using 
corporate information systems by specific 
areas of activities, based on information 
requests compiled in accordance with 
the GRI-G3 recommendations and also based 
on previous Company experience of drafting 
annual sustainable development reports.
Preparation of this Report has been 
guided by version G3.1 of the Sustainability 
Reporting Guidelines, provided by the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI), which represent 
the latest internationally accepted standards 
for reporting in the sphere of sustainable de -
velopment. As in previous issues, this Report 
is guided by Level-B GRI requirements,  which 
calls for broad disclosure including both stan -
dard performance indicators and manage -
ment approaches1.  Some indicators from the GRI Oil and 
Gas Sector Supplement were also used, 
and the Report covers all the areas of 
social responsibility that are required 
by ISO 26000:2010 Guidance on Social 
Responsibility.
Preparation of the Report was com -
bined with an internal self-assessment by 
the Company of its compliance with the so -
cial responsibility principles enshrined in 
ISO 26000:20102. The assessment consid -
ered how the Company’s mission, strategy, 
corporate culture and policies measure up 
to the Standard, and the extent to which 
the Standard is applied in organising practical 
activities in specific fields. Application of 
the provisions of ISO 26000:2010 is high -
lighted in the relevant sections of this Report.
Attention to sustainable development 
issues is important both for achieving 
the Company’s strategic objectives and for 
meeting the information needs of stake -
holders concerning economic, social and 
environmental aspects of Company opera -
tions. The reader is referred to the Table of 
Contents for the range of topics covered by 
the Report. Selection of subject matter for 
the Report was guided by the provisions of 
ISO 26000:2010, GRI Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines, and understanding of informa -
tion needs as a result of interaction with key 
stakeholders in 2011.  ABOUT THE REPORT

are helping to reduce our environmental 
footprint. The successful transition of 
Company refineries to production of top-
grade eco-friendly fuels also marks an im -
portant step forward in combatting pol -
lution. Gazprom Neft worked to improve 
corporate transparency and disclosure of 
information to stockholders and inves -
tors in 2011, and our practice in applying 
international standards of social responsi -
bility reached new levels. I am convinced 
that all these efforts are of the greatest 
importance in achieving Gazprom Neft’s 
plans and strategic goals.ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN OF    
THE BOARD OF JSC GAZPROM NEFT
Gazprom Neft’s business results broke 
a number of records in 2011. Our rate 
of production growth, for example, was 
the highest in the Russian oil and gas 
industry. We made rapid progress in 
the refining segment and in sales of fuel, 
particularly through premium distribution 
channels, and we substantially broadened 
the geography of our operations. These 
results offer the best possible proof of 
our Company’s leadership potential. 
The achievements of 2011 represent 
a major step towards the goals set out 
in our long-term development strategy, 
and provide a firm foundation for further 
business growth and increase of our 
capitalization.
While we were helped by the favorable 
market situation last year, our staff also 
made an equally important contribution 
to our success through their professional -
ism, dedication and focus on results.Gazprom Neft continued its system -
atic work in developing the Company’s hu -
man potential in 2011, installing the latest 
HR management systems, and adopting 
new programs for training and retrain -
ing. We continued to accord the highest 
priority to issues of safety in the work -
place. As a socially responsible Company, 
Gazprom Neft has agreements with 
regional authorities to implement large-
scale social projects that offer major 
benefits in locations where the Company 
has operations. The environmental safety 
management system at Gazprom Neft 
ensures control over environment-
related risks. Funds invested in innovative 
development programs for oil production 
and refining, and programs being carried 
out to upgrade our production capacity,

Gazprom Neft raised all aspects of its 
business to new levels in 2011. Oil and gas 
production increased by 8%, refining vol -
umes grew by 7%, and the volume of sales 
via premium channels was 38% greater than 
in 2010. 
These achievements were made possible 
by favorable market conditions and consistent 
implementation of the Company’s long-term 
strategy to double key production indicators 
and to retain leadership in the Russian oil and 
gas industry as measured by operational and 
financial efficiency. 
Our Company led the Russian industry 
in 2011 in terms of hydrocarbon production 
growth rate, and we expanded the geogra -
phy of our business by entering a new pro -
duction area — Orenburg Region. Work con -
tinued upgrading our refining assets in order 
to improve the quality of our petroleum 
products and to produce engine fuels in 
higher environmental classes. The Company 
expanded its filling station chain in Russia 
and abroad, became the leader in gasoline 
and aviation fuel supplies in the domestic 
market, and substantially increased its 
presence in the lubricant and bunker fuel 
segments. These results reflect the profes -
sionalism, efficiency and accountability of 
all the Company’s employees.Gazprom Neft acknowledges the close 
relationship between business efficiency and 
social responsibility. Professional develop -
ment and social protection of our employees, 
minimization of environmental impact from 
operations, and support for the socio-eco -
nomic development of the regions where we 
operate are unconditional Company priorities. 
Our new projects undergo thorough environ -
mental and social impact analyses in consulta -
tion with all stakeholders at the planning and 
development stage. 
The Company offers extensive profes -
sional and career development opportuni -
ties to its employees. In 2011, it designed 
and implemented five new professional 
training programs based on up-to-date 
training techniques. A program is underway 
to create a pool of executive employees who 
can succeed to top management positions. 
By the end of 2011, there were 1,373 such 
employees in this category. Total invest -
ments in personnel rose by 11.5% in 2011 to 
a level of RUB 45.3 billion. 
Organization of a large number of sports 
and recreation events provides further impor -
tant evidence of Gazprom Neft’s concern for 
its employees: the number of Company em -
ployees participating in such events increased 
by 14% in 2011 compared with 2010.Gazprom Neft wants to become 
an international oil industry leader in terms 
of industrial and environmental safety. 
The Company carefully monitors the en -
vironmental context of its operations, and 
implements a set of programs that seek to 
reduce negative impacts. Expenditures by 
Gazprom Neft on environmental secu -
rity totaled RUB 3,656.7 million in 2011. 
The Company works particularly hard at 
raising levels of employee know-how in oc -
cupational and environmental safety. 
The principles of social responsibility 
and sustainable development are deeply 
ingrained in Gazprom Neft’s corporate culture. 
The Company’s employees share these prin -
ciples and play an active part in implementing 
socially important programs and supporting 
social projects as volunteers. Over 3,000 of 
the Company’s employees took part in volun -
teer programs during 2011.
Gazprom Neft has a tradition of holding 
corporate forums and informal dialogues 
between management and employees to 
address topical issues in Company business. 
The Company’s 2011 corporate forum gathered 
350 delegates from all of the enterprises within 
Gazprom Neft Group. A number of the propos -
als, which were put forward by employees at 
the forum, are already being implemented. ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN

MISSION & STRATEGY
The Company has formulated its 
mission to reflect the expectations of all 
stakeholders (stakeholders, customers, 
partners, state and society, employees), 
with main emphasis on growth, 
efficiency, and responsibility.
The Development Strategy, which 
Gazprom Neft adopted in 2010, defines 
core business principles, goals, develop -
ment directions and target performance 
results for the parent company and 
for Group subsidiaries and associates. 
Gazprom Neft aims to become a Russia-
based, internationally present company 
with a geographically diversified asset 
portfolio across the entire value chain, 
taking an active part in the development 
of regions where it has operations, and 
adhering to principles of social and envi -
ronmental responsibility.The future of the Russian oil sector 
depends on the ability of companies to 
meet growing demand for their outputs in 
a context where crude oil production is be -
coming more difficult and quality require -
ments for refined products are becoming 
more exacting. The most urgent tasks in 
crude oil production are to boost recovery 
efficiency at established fields, where 
the resource base is already depleted, and 
to develop new fields in remote regions 
and offshore. The key tasks in refining 
are to upgrade capacities and achieve 
greater refining depth, boosting yields of 
light petroleum products. Gazprom Neft’s 
strategy is designed to address the chal -
lenges which face the entire Russian oil 
industry, and thereby contribute to ensur -
ing growth of the industry in the medium 
and long term.THE MISSION OF GAZPROM NEFT 
supply high-quality fuels to consum -
ers, to conduct its business honestly 
and responsibly, to take care of its 
employees, and to achieve leadership 
by criteria of business efficiency, thus 
securing long-term and balanced 
growth.
BUSINESS TARGETS

Gazprom Neft significantly 
increased its output levels in 
2011 through acquisition of 
new assets and improvement 
of development efficiency at 
existing fields. Compared to 2010, 
hydrocarbon production volumes 
grew by 8.4% and refining 
volume by 6.8%. Gazprom Neft’s 
financial performance in 
2011 was unprecedented in 
the history of the Company: 
EBITDA grew by 40,30%, and net 
profit was 70% higher y-o-y. 
Company revenues in 2011 
grew by 34.3%. The Company’s 
sales network also developed 
successfully. Petroleum product 
sales volumes on the domestic 
market grew by 18,3% in 2011 
against 2010. Gazprom Neft 
became the leader in automotive 
gasoline and aviation fuel 
supplies to the domestic market 
and significantly increased its 
share of the lubricant and bunker 
fuel segments.
Such results are a reflection of 
the favourable market environment, 
but they are also the fruit of further 
implementation of the Company’s long-
term strategy to double key production 
indicators while retaining leadership than in 2010. The growth was mainly 
due to refinery upgrade programmes, 
investments in development of NIS, 
and rapid expansion and rebranding of 
the filling station chain.
Gazprom Neft made a number 
of acquisitions in 2011, the largest 
of which were shares in Sibir Energy, 
shares in Serbian NIS, and assets in 
Orenburg Region (the Tsarichanskoye 
and Kapitonovskoye fields). A number of 
oil field service assets were sold. Total 
investments in asset acquisition net of 
proceeds from sale of the oil field service 
businesses were USD 1.0 bn. Investment 
in foreign projects and new asset 
development projects totalled USD 0.5 bn.by operational and financial efficiency. 
During the reporting year Gazprom Neft 
continued its work to create a platform 
for future development, investing in 
asset expansion and upgrading existing 
capacities. 
In 2011 Gazprom Neft accounted 
for 9% of total Russian crude oil and gas 
production4 and 14.8% of the country’s 
refinery output5, as well as 6% of 
Russian crude oil exports via capacities 
of the national pipeline monopoly, 
Transneft6. 
Investments by Gazprom Neft in 2011 
totalled USD 5.5 bn. Capital investments 
in organic growth and asset maintenance 
were USD 4.0 bn in 2011, or 22% more OPERATING & FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2011

EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION OF CRUDE 
OIL & GAS  
Gazprom Neft and its fully controlled 
subsidiaries completed construction of 
25 appraisal, prospecting and exploration 
wells at their license areas during 2011, and 
18 of the new wells gave commercial hydro -
carbon inflows. Total exploration drilling in 
2011 was 59,136 m (not including metres 
drilled by the Center for Science-Intensive 
Technologies), which is comparable with 
levels in 2010. Exploration drilling in 2011 
led to discovery of the Myginskoye oil field 
with С1+С2 crude oil reserves of 2 mn t, and 
the Ignyalinskoye oil and gas condensate 
field with С1+С2 crude oil reserves of over 
40 mn t and gas reserves of 20 bn m3. 
Gazprom Neft and its subsidiaries also 
discovered 23 new oil and gas deposits at 
the Ety-Purovskoye, Vyngapurovskoye, 
Priobskoye, Urmanskoye, Vakunayskoye, 
and Tympuchikanskoye fields with recover -
able С1 crude oil reserves of 9.4 mn t and 
С2 reserves of 17.2 mn t. Total increase of 
the Company’s crude oil reserves in indus -
trial categories was 62.7 mn t in 2011.
Gazprom Neft’s proven SPE hydrocar -
bon reserves increased by 164 mn TPE 
in 2011 due to revision of reserves and 
new acquisitions by the Company (the 
Orenburg field group). Replacement of 
production by proven hydrocarbon re -
serves was 214% in 2011.
Gazprom Neft retained its positions in 
2011 as a Russian industry leader by levels 
of crude oil and gas production.Gazprom Neft has a number of major 
ongoing production projects outside 
Russia. It is intended that international 
assets of the Company should account for 
about 10% of its consolidated hydrocar -
bon production by 2020.
The Company is rapidly developing 
its gas production business in order to 
commercialize associated and natural 
gas reserves at oil fields and thereby 
add value. In 2011, aggregate produc -
tion/use of gas by Gazprom Neft Group 
(including shares in production by JVs) 
was 9,067 mn m3 (0.88 mn ft3/day). 
Deliveries by the Company of marketable 
gas (after own consumption, injection 
into strata and transport losses) stood at 
8,544.5 mn m3 (0.663 mn ft3/day).
CRUDE OIL REFINING, 
SALES & MARKETING  
Gazprom Neft showed one of the highest 
rates of growth in refining among Russian oil 
companies in 2011. Inputs to Company refin -
eries grew by 6.8% in the reporting year, from 
37.9 to 40.5 mn t of crude oil. The Company 
is implementing a large-scale program to 
upgrade and renovate capacities and to build 
new installations, with the target of increasing 
the depth of refining to 90-95% and raising 
yield of light petroleum products to 77%. 
The program will raise process technologies 
at Company refineries to best international 
levels by all main criteria, including environ -
mental and safety criteria.The Omsk Refinery completed the first 
stage of reconstruction of its KT-1/1 catalytic 
cracking facility in 2011. Work was also carried 
out at Omsk on hydrotreatment units for 
catalytic cracking gasoline and for diesel fuel, 
a project was launched to build a deep refining 
facility for crude oil, and the Refinery began 
production of polymer bitumen materials. 
The Moscow Refinery began construction 
work on isomerisation and gasoline hy -
drotreatment units and reconstruction of 
a diesel fuel hydrotreatment unit. The YaNOS 
Refinery completed construction work on 
new isomerisation and gasoline hydrotreat -
ment units in 2011. Completion of these 
projects will increase output of high-octane 
gasoline, which complies with the Russian 
Government’s Technical Regulations for fuel 
quality.The Company production subsidiary, 
Gazprom Neft-Khantos, achieved 
particularly rapid growth of output in 
2011, producing 10.849 mn t of oil, 
which is 10.6% more than in 2010 
and 3.2% above the 2011 business 
target. Gazprom Neft’s foreign 
subsidiary, Naftna Industrija Srbije 
(NIS), also put in an outstanding 
performance in 2011, raising crude 
oil production by 16.7% to 1.133 mn t 
from 971,000 t in 2010.< previous

cracking facilities).
Gazprom Neft increased output of petro -
leum products by 7.6% to 38.3 mn t in 2011.
Upgrade programs at Company refiner -
ies and optimisation of the product range 
increased output of automotive gasoline by 
11.7%, high-quality aviation fuel by 5.6%, and 
Euro-4 and -5 diesel fuel by 2.6 times in 2011. 
Gazprom Neft also joined the Top-3 Russian 
producers of bitumen in 2011 thanks to out -
put growth by 24.8%. 
The Company secured its positions on 
the retail market for petroleum products 
in 2011. The Company sells petroleum 
products both in Russia, where it has one 
of the most extensive sales networks 
in Russia, and in neighbouring states.

network of filling stations in 2011, raising 
the total number of stations to 1,670, in -
cluding 1,245 in Russia and the CIS. Average 
sales per filling station in Russia rose by 
40% to 14.2 t per day, and the Company had 
retail presence in 27 regions by the end of 
the year. All stations in the Company chain 
are standardised under the Gazprom Neft 
retail brand. According to an online survey 
by Romir Research Group, Gazprom Neft 
was among filling station brands with best 
recognition in Russia in 2011. 
Gazprom Neft launched sales of 
premium-class engine fuel under the G-Drive 
brand in 2011. G-Drive accounted for 19% of 
total AI-95 gasoline sales in 2011 at stations 
where it was available. Pilot sales of G-Diesel 
began at the end of 2011, thus expanding 
the range of the Company’s premium retail 
motor fuels.The value of sales of non-fuel goods 
and services at filling stations rose to 
RUB 4.9 bn in 2011. Trading space for 
this business increased in the period 
to 32,100 m2, and sales per m2 rose to 
RUB 153,000. A uniform product range 
matrix was imposed at all outlets.
Gazprom Neft Lubricants was 
the leader in Russia in 2011 by the number 
of new products brought to the market 
(30 items), and its share of the packaged 
lube oil market increased from 8.2% to 
10.5%. Volumes of packaged lube oil sales 
in Russia grew by 30% in 2011 and sale of 
G-Family products doubled in comparison 
with 2010. Recognition of the Company’s 
G-Energy premium brand rose by 18% in

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011
Company strategy gives priority to increased 
sales of gas engine fuels – liquefied petroleum 
gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas 
(CNG), – main advantages of which include low 
environmental impact and cost effectiveness. These advantages are particularly 
valuable for public transport and 
commercial vehicles in large cities. As of 
today, the share of LPG and CNG in total 
consumption of motor fuels in Russia 
is less than 4%. However, significant 
growth of the LPG market is expected 
as mass-production of gas-powered 
cars develops and more gas filling 
stations are built. Most of Russia’s LPG 
consumption potential is concentrated 
in large metropolises, particularly 
Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and could 
rise to 3 bn m3 per year, which 10 times 
more than current consumption. 
Gazprom Neft is rapidly developing 
its sales of gas fuels for vehicles. 
The Company had 131 gas filling units 
at its filling stations by the end of 2011 
when LPG sales volumes were over 
90,000 tons. The Company is targeting 
increase in the number of its multi-fuel 
stations selling LPG to 285 stations 
by 2020, when total annual sales of gas 
fuel for vehicles should be in excess 
of 260,000 t. Supplies of liquefied 
gas for the retail network will come 
from the Company’s own refineries (in 
Omsk, Moscow, and Yaroslavl), and from 
facilities of Gazprom Group and SIBUR.25< previous

Kazakhstan (Astana), Tajikistan 
(Dushanbe) and Kyrgyzstan (Bishkek). 
Sales geography on the external 
market expanded significantly dur -
ing the year: by the end of 2011 
Gazprom Neft-Aero was refuelling 
aircraft in 30 countries (49 cities) as 
compared with 11 countries  
(18 cities) in 2010.
Gazprom Neft Marine Bunker 
reinforced its leading positions on 
the Russian bunkering market in 
2011, raising its market share to 
18.5%. Direct-to-vessel sales of ma -
rine fuel grew by 44% against 2010 
to 1.3 mn t, and total annual sales of 
marine fuel increased by 1.5 times 
to 2.2 mn t. Gazprom Neft Marine 
Bunker entered new sales markets 
in Russia and abroad: the company 
now provides bunkering in the ports 
of Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, 
Sakhalin Island, and in the Baltic 
ports of Klaipeda, Tallinn and Riga.Gazprom Neft is a major exporter of crude 
oil and petroleum products. Main export routes 
in 2011 were via Novorossiysk and Tuapse 
seaports on the Black Sea, the Baltic port of 
Primorsk, and through the Druzhba pipeline 
to the Czech Republic and Germany. Gazprom 
Neft Group exported 13.1 mn t of crude oil in 
absolute terms in 2011, or 2.8 mn t less than in 
2010. Decline of crude oil exports by 17.9% in 
the reporting year was due to increase of crude 
oil refining at the Company’s refineries in 2011.
INNOVATION
Developing innovation in priority business areas 
is a prerequisite for the Company’s successful 
long-term growth. Increasing efficiency of oil 
production from depleted resources at estab -
lished fields, developing new regions in Yamal, 
Eastern Siberia, and Orenburg Region, beginning 
offshore operations (including work beyond 
the Arctic Circle), implementing projects outside 
Russia, developing non-conventional hydrocar -
bon sources, lowering environmental burden, 
energy saving – all these huge and complex tasks 
of crude oil exploration and production call for 
innovative solutions. The main objectives of R&D 
and innovation efforts in refining business are to 
improve product quality, lower production costs, 
and to develop and produce new kinds of technol -
ogy, products and services.
In 2011, the Joint Scientific Research 
Centre for Innovation Technologies in Crude 
oil Production (JSRC) was jointly established 
by LLC Gazprom Neft Science and Technology 
Centre and Saint Petersburg State Mining 
University. The JSRC is centred on eight scientific 
research laboratories with the most up-to-date 
experimental tools and equipment. The main themes of research work by 
the JRSC in 2011 were:
• improvement of reservoir recovery and well 
output;
• research into crude oil composition and 
properties, solid deposits and corrosion in 
crude oil production equipment;
• selection and testing of liquids used for 
bottom-hole treatment, well kill, repair and 
insulation work, hydraulic fracturing;
• development and adaptation of existing 
technologies;
• developing formulae for drilling muds and 
grouts.
The main goals of Gazprom Neft’s 
innovation and scientific research ef -
forts in crude oil refining are to ensure 
competitiveness in technology, improve 
product quality, reduce production costs, 
to develop and produce new kinds of 
technology, products and services, and to 
resolve current production problems. In 
2011, the Company's Management Board 
approved a Strategy for Development of 
Innovation and Scientific Research in Oil 
Refining and Petrochemical Processing up 
to 2020. The document defines principles 
and key performance indicators for inno -
vation activities in logistics, refining and 
sales, as well as key directions for develop -
ment of innovative technologies in crude 
oil refining and petrochemical processing.  < previous

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011contents
OUTLOOK: PLANS FOR 2012
R&D in crude oil refining and petrochemi -
cal processing is being carried out in 
partnership with major Russian research 
entities, whose work has application in 
the main technology areas that are of 
importance to Gazprom Neft. Research 
institutes that are partners of Gazprom 
Neft include the Topchiyev Institute of 
Petrochemical Synthesis, the Gubkin 
Russian State University of Oil and Gas, 
the Institute for Hydrocarbon Refining, 
OJSC NPP Neftekhim, etc.
During 2011, the Company’s crude 
oil refining units implemented both large 
long-term innovative projects to develop 
strategically important technologies, and 
workshop-level R&D to meet the production 
needs of a specific refinery. One large-scale 
innovative project in 2011, carried out 
jointly with the Institute for Problems of 
Hydrocarbon Refining of the Siberian Branch 
of the Russian Academy of Science, was 
the development and production launch of 
a biceolyte catalyst for catalytic cracking 
at Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery. Use of 
the new catalyst helped the Omsk Refinery 
to increase its output of light petroleum 
products, achieve deeper refining, and lower 
sulphur content in products, while also 
cutting operating costs. Gazprom Neft is 
currently the only Russian manufacturer of 
cracking catalysts.Gazprom Neft’s development strategy 
calls for increase of investments in 
organic growth to USD 4.8 bn in 2012, 
including increases of 13% in exploration 
and production, 58% in crude oil refining 
and 12% in sales of petroleum products. 
A further RUB 0.7 bn will be invested to 
develop new assets and to implement 
major oil production projects.
According to the approved Business Plan, 
hydrocarbon production should rise by 4.1% 
in 2012 to 59.6 mn TPE. Gazprom Neft will 
continue to increase its resource base and 
make efforts to stabilize production at exist -
ing assets. Large fields will be developed, 
both in Russia (fields in the northern part 
of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, 
Messoyakha group fields, Novoportovskoye) 
and internationally (Badra, Junin), and assets 
in Orenburg Region will be integrated.
Key Company objectives in refining are 
to increase process efficiency and product 
quality. In 2012 refineries will continue to 
implement programs for improvement of 
engine fuel quality, changeover to Euro-4 
and Euro-5, and increase of high-octane 
gasoline output. Work will also be carried 
out to increase refining depth. Scheduled 
events include launch of hydrotreatment 
units for catalytic cracking gasoline and 
diesel fuel at the Omsk Refinery, and 
completion of  a gasoline hydrotreatment 
unit and isomerisation unit, as well as re -
construction an L-24/2000 hydrotreatment 
unit at the Moscow Refinery.  Further steps in the program for upgrade of 
NIS refining facilities in Serbia will include 
commissioning of a light hydrocracking 
facility at the Pancevo Refinery.
Expansion and efficiency improve -
ments of the retail network in 2012 will 
include reconstruction and rebranding of 
filling stations, and further implementa -
tion of customer loyalty programmes. 
The filling station chain will be expanded 
in the Southern Federal District, Nizhny 
Novgorod and  Chelyabinsk Regions, 
Saint Petersburg and Krasnoyarsk, as well 
as in Kazakhstan. Special emphasis will be 
placed on sales of G-Drive fuel (both gasoline 
and diesel). Main actions will include pro -
grams to promote G-Family products, launch 
of the new lube packaging facility in Omsk 
and achievement of capacity production 
there, creation of a distribution network for 
Gazprom Neft-Lubricants in Central Asia 
and Northern Europe, creation of a bunker 
terminal network (terminal construction in 
Saint Petersburg, Murmansk, Ust-Luga and 
Kaliningrad), and expansion of market pres -
ence in the Baltic states and the Balkans. 
As regards overall efficiency of petroleum 
product sales, priority will be given to sales 
of aviation fuel, lubricants, bitumen, and 
to petrochemicals and bunkering (i.e. to all 
premium business segments). Main objec -
tives are to boost sales efficiency, expand 
business geography, and increase market 
share in premium market segments.
Programs to increase operating ef -
ficiency will be implemented in all core 
business areas.< previous

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
& SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Gazprom Neft does all it can to observe 
the principles of sustainable development 
and social responsibility in conduct of its 
business. These principles are understood by 
the Company in the way that they are understood 
by the international business community and as 
set forth in ISO 26000:2010 Guidance for Social 
Responsibility.   Sustainable development  – development that meets the needs 
of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their needs.
Social responsibility  – responsibility of an organization 
for the impacts of its decisions and activities on society and 
the environment, through transparent and ethical behavior that 
contributes to sustainable development, including health and 
the welfare of society:
• takes into account the expectations of stakeholders;
• is in compliance with applicable law and consistent with 
international norms of behavior;
• and is integrated throughout the organization and practiced 
in its relationships.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011
Infrastructure will be developed in parallel 
with industrial facilities: roads will be built, 
territories improved, and power supply 
units installed. The company is carefully 
assessing the potential social and environ -
mental impact of implementing the new 
projects. Environmental audit is carried out 
when preparing investment decisions in 
order to identify the technologies that are 
best suited to local specifics. In 2011 a so -
cial and environmental audit of this types 
was carried out for the Junin-6 project in 
Venezuela.Strategy of Gazprom Neft in explora -
tion and production is based on efficient 
implementation of major projects to 
develop new fields in Russia and abroad, 
together with increased operating ef -
ficiency at existing assets in order to 
achieve the production target of 100 mn 
TOE (tons of oil equivalent) by 2020. The 
first three projects are focused on three 
very large assets in the northern part of 
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, 
which will form a powerful new oil and gas 
production centre. The fourth project, 
focused on fields in Orenburg Region, 
has much growth potential, promising 
production increments of up to 3 mn TOE 
or more in the next three years. And two other projects are being implemented by 
Gazprom Neft in the world’s largest oil 
and gas provinces: Iraq and Venezuela. 
In addition, the Company has assembled 
a portfolio of exploration projects, includ -
ing several offshore. As it embarks on this 
large-scale program of major projects in 
various climatic, geological, geographi -
cal and political contexts, the Company 
faces radically new challenges in the so -
cial, labour and environmental spheres. 
These challenges have required the cre -
ation of a new internationally compliant 
health, safety and environment system 
within Gazprom Neft-Razvitie7 and 
within the frameworks of the projects. The Company has already clarified its priorities
in this area by definition of six key major projects .29
7 Gazprom Neft-Razvitie is a specialized organization within the Company’s exploration and production business division, serving as a centre for competencies  
and for the management and development of human resources in major projects.< previous

 chaptercontents30
JSC GAZPROM NEFT
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011contents
Priorities for sustainability are defined 
by the nature and scale of the Company’s 
core activities, as well as the chal -
lenges which it faces in the course of its 
development. One of these challenges is 
the deteriorating quality of reserves and 
the resulting need to increase efficiency 
of development work at established fields, 
and to enter new and remote regions 
where issues of environmental vulnerabil -
ity have to be addressed. More stringent 
requirements for the quality of petroleum 
products entail other challenges, includ -
ing technology upgrades and innovation 
in oil refining. Finally, there is the issue of 
sourcing talented personnel for Company 
development, which is no easy task in 
a context of human resource shortages in 
Russia’s real sector, and therefore calls for 
a set of special programs.
Gazprom Neft’s development strat -
egy takes account of a broad strategic 
context, where social and environmental 
factors are no less important than fac -
tors of a financial and economic nature. 
Sustainable development is an inte -
gral part of the Company’s long-term 
strategy. The tasks, which Gazprom Neft 
constantly sets and resolves, relate not 
only to financial and technology issues 
but also to the accumulation of social 
capital, rational use and preservation of 
natural wealth. These tasks are closely 
interlinked within the Company’s unified 
strategy.  Gazprom Neft acknowledges that oil 
companies, due to the great social 
significance and scale of environmental 
impact of their operations, bear 
significant social and environmental 
responsibility, requiring consistent, 
comprehensive work to manage 
the consequences of company opera -
tions for society and the environment, 
and engagement with a wide range of 
stakeholders.  
The key principle underlying the for -
mulation and implementation of 
Gazprom Neft’s sustainable development 
strategy is the achievement of balance 
between the economic, social and envi -
ronmental components of its business. 
The Company also takes full account of 
expectations regarding its responsible 
conduct as reflected in international and 
Russian law and in its contractual obliga -
tions, as well as expectations identified in 
the course of interaction with stakehold -
ers. The Company builds its strategy with 
due attention to priorities of national 
and regional development. In 2011, 
Gazprom Neft continued to implement 
a systematic approach to formulation 
of its strategic development concept. 
The Company plans a step-by-step transi -
tion to an integrated system for long-term 
strategy design and protection of its mid-
term business plans in order to ensure 
coordination of management actions at 
all levels and in all areas of business.They include a range of issues that con -
tribute to secure development: safety in 
the workplace, reduction of negative envi -
ronmental impact, rational use of natural 
resources and of personnel, observance of 
labour rights and the need for professional 
development, and participation in local 
community development. Achievement of 
target benchmarks in crude oil production, 
refining and sales depends on finding solu -
tions to a set of tasks in human resource 
development, and the implementation of 
new, more efficient and environmentally 
friendly technologies.
Implementation of the Company’s 
sustainable development strategy in 2011 
was in conformity with mid-term goals 
for 2011–2013 as defined by the long-
term strategy of Gazprom Neft. While in 
the previous period (2008–2010) Gazprom 
Neft laid foundations for rapid future 
growth8, the current period (2011–2013) 
envisages the launch of a number of major 
projects which will ensure long-term busi -
ness development in all areas of Company 
business.
The Company’s mid-term sustainability 
goals for 2011–2013 mainly cover the prin -
cipal issues of social responsibility set out 
in ISO 26000, including such issues as cor -
porate governance, human rights, labour 
practices, the environment, fair business 
practices, consumer issues and involve -
ment in community development.STRATEGIC CHALLENGES & BENCHMARKS

Thus, mature assets are handled by 
the Production Directorate, implementation 
of major new projects is the responsibil -
ity of the Major Projects Directorate, while 
expansion of the exploration and resource 
base is the responsibility of the Exploration 
and Resource Base Development Directorate. 
The growth of gas production, both through 
greater utilisation of associated oil gas and 
through entering projects with a significant 
gas component, justified the creation of 
a special Gas Directorate. A newly created 
organisation, Gazprom Neft-Razvitie, will 
serve as a centre for competences, manage -
ment and development of human resources 
in major projects, supporting the implemen -
tation of major development projects at new 
fields in Russia.In 2011, Gazprom Neft continued 
integration of new assets into its corporate 
governance structure. Unified corporate 
governance standards were implemented 
and governing bodies were formed at 
the new assets. Spin-off of the Company’s oil 
field service business was also completed in 
2011 by the sale of a number of subsidiaries. 
Gazprom Neft’s disposal of its oil field service 
assets should both reduce costs and encour -
age greater competition in this business 
segment, thus raising the quality of oil field 
services. The Company has made efforts to 
ensure stable development of the assets in 
the future and acceptance by the new owner 
of the terms and conditions of collective 
agreements which were in place when the as -
sets were part of Gazprom Neft.
The Company made a number of organi -
sational changes in 2011 to improve business 
efficiency. The most important of these 
changes were in exploration and production 
operations. E&P is the key business unit of 
Gazprom Neft and rapid growth of business 
scale and increase in the number of produc -
tion subsidiaries have necessitated various 
organisational changes. Special directorates 
were established within the unit during 2011, 
each containing large portfolios of important 
projects. The new structure of the unit uses 
a principle of asset development stages 
(exploration, major project implementation, 
production and development of gas busi -
ness), which will help personnel of the cor -
porate centre to achieve maximum focus on 
high-quality management through the entire 
life cycle of assets.  The candidate for the role of independent 
auditor is approved annually by the General 
Meeting of Stakeholders at the proposal of 
the Board of Directors.
The Company has a structured, objec -
tive remuneration program for top and 
senior managers establishing a link between 
short-term goals, including those related to 
sustainable development, and the amount of 
remuneration14.
The Company implements mechanisms 
aimed at eliminating possible conflicts of 
interest in senior management bodies15.
Gazprom Neft strives to maintain a high 
level of informational transparency. The 
Company publishes financial statements to 
international standards, as well as manage -
ment reporting and sustainable development 
reports. Since 2010, preparation of these 
documents has been synchronised and 
they are published simultaneously. These 
documents are also available for viewing on 
the Company’s website. In this way access to 
data reflecting all aspects of the Company’s 
activities is provided to all stakeholders and 
the general public. The mechanisms by which 
Gazprom Neft’s stakeholders can influence 
the actions of the Company’s manage -
ment bodies are set out in the Company’s 
Corporate Code of Conduct. Information 
on compliance with the Corporate Code 
of Conduct is published in the Company’s 
Annual Report for 2011.
The Company works closely with 
stakeholders and develops relationships 
with the investment community in order 
to ensure a high level of transparency. 
The high level of information disclosure to 
Gazprom Neft’s stakeholders and inves -
tors has been noted in a number of studies 
by independent investor relations agen -
cies and is also proved by awards, which 
the Company has won in this field16.
14 Information on the amount of remuneration to members of the Board of Directors and members of the Management Board of the Company is provided 
in Gazprom Neft’s Annual Report for 2011.
15 More detailed information on compliance with the Corporate Code of Conduct is provided in Gazprom Neft’s Annual Report for 2011.
16 This is described in more detail in the next section of the present Chapter.The spin-off of oil field service as -
sets in 2011 included the sale of 
SpetsTransService transport com -
pany, which was bought by Service 
Logistics Company. According to 
terms of the sale, SpetsTransService 
will retain long-term contracts with 
Gazprom Neft Group enterprises and 
corresponding guaranteed volumes 
of work until the end of 2013. The 
agreement also requires the new 
owner to comply with the terms and

Gazprom Neft views stakeholder 
engagement as a key element of 
corporate social responsibility. 
Stakeholders include organisations and 
individuals with interests that are in any 
way connected with the decisions or 
activities of a company. Gazprom Neft 
distinguishes a number of key 
stakeholder groups, whose interests

have the most significant influence 
on the Company’s ability to realise its 
strategic goals. These are stakeholders 
and investors, the Company's staff, 
government authorities, business 
partners, local communities, and 
the general public. In formulating 
its approaches to engagement and 
interaction, the Company bears in mind 
the level and scale of relationships

For example, a distinction is made among 
the Company’s personnel between 
operating personnel, various levels of 
management, and young specialists, 
while the local communities’ category is 
sub-divided into such groups as school 
leavers and students, veterans of war 
and labour, small indigenous peoples in 
Northern Russia, and public associations 
specialising in environmental and social 
work.
The Company’s stakeholder engage -
ment mechanisms ensure feedback, allow

practice of investor meetings, corporate 
forums and conferences held jointly with 
business partners, government author -
ity representatives and representatives 
of the expert community, as well as public 
hearings on social and environmental issues 
of concern to stakeholders. Gazprom Neft

communication technologies in order to 
develop a dialogue with stakeholders.Stakeholder engagement principles 
and priorities are reflected in corporate 
documents (Corporate Code of Conduct, 
Corporate Code, documents regulating 
specific areas of Company business). 
Development of the engagement system 
is reflected in the Company's sustainable 
development reports for 2007–2010.
The main areas of engagement in 
2011 were determined by the tasks of 
the Company’s strategy implementa -
tion and the priorities of its stakehold -
ers. According to the recommendations 
of ISO 26000:2010 (Guidance on Social 
Responsibility), the Company placed 
special emphasis on stakeholder inter -
ests, which may relate not only its own 
interests but to the interests of society as 
a whole.
Gazprom Neft constantly studies 
the internal and external social environ -
ment, refining the agenda for stakeholder 
engagement in a way that takes account 
of the strategic benchmarks and priorities 
of stakeholders. In 2011, the Company 
started work on a detailed ‘stakeholder 
map’ which will help to distinguish 
stakeholder groups of special impor -
tance for Company strategy more clearly. 
Segments are distinguished within each 
key group, whose interests and roles may 
differ to some degree.  MAIN STAKEHOLDER

Traditional forms of consumer engagement, such as 
quality satisfaction surveys, were supplemented in 
2011 by a special action: the ‘Open Expert Review 
of Service Quality’, which was held at Gazprom 
Neft filling stations across Russia between May 
and September. The action gave every motorist 
the opportunity to express an ‘expert opinion’ on 
the level of service at Company’s filling stations. A total of 50,000 people took part in 
the action, sending over 100,000 mes -
sages to the Company. The 6000 cus -
tomers who submitted the most useful 
comments were rewarded with branded 
souvenirs, and the finalists were invited 
on a ‘expert tour’ across Russia. The 
tour was organized on a regional basis: 
a Central Russia team visited the Urals, 
the Urals team visited Siberia, and 
the Siberians visited Central Russia.
The average share of positive as -
sessments in all comments on the quali -
ty of service, employee friendliness, fuel 
quality, service speed, and cleanliness 
at Gazprom Neft filling stations reached 
85% in 2011.

Grade 2, type 2 Euro diesel fuel produced at 
YaNOS and intended for use in Arctic condi -
tions won the ‘New Product of the Year’ 
award and a special diploma at the ‘100 Best 
Russian Goods’ competition. The prod -
uct meets requirements of the European 
ЕН 590, Euro-4 standard.
Sales of premium products conforming 
to international specifications (G-Family 
products) doubled in 2011, reflecting 
the strategic transformation of Gazprom 
Neft from a raw materials producer into 
a customer-oriented marketing company, 
manufacturing high-margin lube oils for re -
tail and industry markets. Russian consumer 
recognition of the G-Energy premium brand 
grew by 18% in the reporting year. 
As it expands its sales network and de -
velops new sales channels, the Company 
endeavours to build relations of trust and 
mutual advantage with customers, sharing 
full information on product features and 
strictly complying with laws that govern 
advertising. Promotion of the Company’s 
consumer brand through advertising is 
being supported by the introduction of 
unified standards for filling station service 
and regular monitoring of compliance with 
the standards by reference to the Gazprom 
Neft Filling Facilities Personnel Operating 
Rules Book and the Filling Station Chain 
Functional Quality Book.  
20  The loyalty program, “We are going the same way”, is based on a bonus system that awards discounts on goods and services at Gazprom Neft filling stations by means of a loyalty card. 
Cardholders accumulate points awarded for their purchases and use them to pay for further goods and services. The program currently functions in 23 regions where Gazprom Neft 
filling stations operate, including Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Tver, Omsk, Ekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, and others. The program was started in 2010.A unified product range matrix has been 
introduced at all of the Company’s petro -
leum product supply enterprises. Customer 
reaction to these efforts has been positive 
(Gazprom Neft’s filling stations were among 
the Top-3 brands in Russia by levels of con -
sumer recognition in 2011). Revenue from 
sales of non-fuel goods and services at filling 
stations rose to RUB 4.9 bn in the reporting 
year, and the number of individual custom -
ers who had joined the filling station loyalty 
program, “We are going the same way”20, 
exceeded 1.9 mn by the end of 2011. 
Gazprom Neft actively supports devel -
opment of exchange trading in petroleum 
products in Russia as a mechanism for effec -
tive, fair and transparent pricing. Gazprom 
Neft is a co-founder of the Saint-Petersburg 
International Mercantile Exchange (SPIMEX), 
and has been trading in petroleum products 
on a regular basis at the Exchange since 
November 2009. The Company’s Exchange 
sales volumes grew by 2.5 times y-o-y in 
2011 when Gazprom Neft sold over 2.5 mn t 
of petroleum products on SPIMEX (14.4% 
of total petroleum products supplied by 
the Company to the domestic market). The 
Company’s share in the total volume of petro -
leum products sold via SPIMEX was above 
22% in 2011. Gazprom Neft ranks second 
among Russian vertically integrated oil com -
panies by the volume of its exchange sales.Gazprom Neft-Aero acted as the of -
ficial refueller for pilot groups at 
the 10th International Air Show, MAX-
2011, held at Zhukovsky (Moscow 
Region) in 2011. The Company sup -
plied fuel for the aircraft of various 
pilot groups: the Russian Knights, 
the Swifts, Falcons of Russia, Rus, as 
well as the Baltic Bees (Latvia) and 
others. Selection of Gazprom Neft 
as the official refueller at MAX-2011 
is an acknowledgement of the busi -
ness quality and leadership status of 
Gazprom Neft-Aero on the Russian 
aviation fuel market.
The Company has provided refu -
elling services, including sales of fuel 
‘into-plane’, since January 1, 2008. 
Since December 2008, Gazprom 
Neft-Aero has been a strategic part -
ner of the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) in refuelling 
services. Gazprom Neft-Aero is one 
of the three leaders on the Russian 
aviation fuel market by volume of 
sales. < previous

Government authorities engagement 
principles
• compliance with legislation;
• fulfilment of tax liabilities and 
responsible use of labour and natural 
resources;
• partnership in addressing 
the challenges of sectoral and regional 
competitiveness. 
As one of the country's largest companies, 
Gazprom Neft engages with both federal 
and regional government authorities. 
The Company strives to be a reliable partner 
for government in addressing the tasks of 
Russia’s socio-economic development. 
The Company takes part in the work 
of expert organisations21 that develop ap -
proaches to issues of sustainable develop -
ment in the oil industry. Company specialists 
work with representatives of government 
agencies and other major Russian companies 
on such matters as rational sub-soil use, es -
tablishment of a well functioning gas market, 
and industry regulation.• On July 8, 2011 in Kirishi (Leningrad 
Region), Prime Minister Vladimir Putin 
chaired  a meeting with industry 
representatives to discuss the situation 
on the Russian refining and petroleum 
product market. The CEO of Gazprom Neft, 
Alexander Dyukov, described progress in 
Gazprom Neft’s refinery upgrade program 
and presented a review of the current 
state of the Russian motor fuel market and 
related development issues. Mr Dyukov 
noted periodic imbalances between supply 
and demand on the motor fuel market, 
caused by rapid post-crisis recovery of de -
mand, pronounced seasonality of demand 
and new requirements of the Technical 
Regulations for motor fuel quality. 
The Gazprom Neft CEO proposed a number 
of measures to improve market efficiency, 
including creation of a motor fuel reserve 
system, coordination of repair schedules at 
refineries, and permission for sales of some 
fuel classes to be continued after 2012. 
Other measures suggested by Mr Dyukov 
to increase market transparency and 
prevent unreasonable price increases 
included development of fuel trading via 
exchanges and the introduction of flexible 
excise rates for petroleum products. 
• In 2011, Gazprom Neft was made 
responsible for developing new technical 
regulations on the safety of oil refining 
and petrochemical facilities for purposes 
of the CIS Customs Union. The Company 
has prepared a draft and submitted it to 
the Russian Ministry of Energy. 
• A cooperation agreement between 
Gazprom Neft and the Ministry of Transport 
calls for the parties to hold regular work -
ing meetings and discussions to share 
information and provide consultation on 
development of bitumen production, road 
construction, and the production and use 
of road bitumens in Russia. The Ministry of 
Transport gave a positive assessment of 
Gazprom Neft’s contribution to the work. The Company’s regional policy is 
designed to take account of the tasks of 
regional development. Gazprom Neft cooper -
ates with regional and municipal authorities 
through socio-economic partnership agree -
ments in order to help address these tasks22. 
The company strictly complies with all 
laws related to political activities and does 
not participate in political movements or 
organisations. Gazprom Neft may cooper -

principles  
• achieving a balance between 
the Company’s development strategy 
and regional development priorities;
• constructive engagement with local 
authorities and the general public to 
address urgent socio-economic and 
environmental issues.
A favourable social climate in regions 
of presence is an important factor for 
successful implementation of the Company’s 
strategic goals. Gazprom Neft cares for 
the interests and expectations of local 
communities, and engages in a constant 
dialogue with them to ensure early 
identification of problems and development 
of constructive cooperation. Subjects of this 
dialogue include environmental protection 
issues, social infrastructure tasks, and 
preserving cultural traditions23.  Most of these issues are then taken into 
account in socio-economic agreements 
with regional and municipal authorities. 
The Company also cooperates with 
non-profit organisations and the expert 
community in addressing these issues. An 
example of such cooperation is the project 
to create municipal sports infrastructure in 
the towns of Noyabrsk and Muravlenko. 
When developing new refining projects, 
Gazprom Neft conducts environmental and 
social risk analysis, and discusses potential 
impact on the natural and social environment 
with the local community in order to find 
optimal solutions in common.The Company has started design 
of infrastructure facilities in 
preparation for development of 
the  Novoportovskoye field. Storage 
tanks, an oil treatment plant, and 
personnel facilities need to be built 
at the field. Transport infrastructure 
will include a pipeline to Cape 
Kamenny and an on-shore reservoir 
tank farm. Discussions to secure 
consent of the local population to 
the construction plans are being 
pursued in parallel with technical 
work. The local population at 
Novoportovskoye consists of 
several dozen reindeer herding 
families and fishing communities  
in small settlements along the Gulf 
of the River Ob. Contacts began in 
the form of information meetings 
with Gazprom Neft specialists. Public 
hearings were held in summer 2011, 
at which the locals expressed their 
views concerning the construction 
of key facilities at the field. Technical 
solutions have been agreed, includ -
ing crossing places for reindeer 
herds along the pipeline to Cape 
Kamenny (there are 270,000 rein -
deer on the Yamal Peninsula and in 
neighbouring Gydan, representing 
the largest concentration of these 
animals in Russia).< previous

These tools are being actively implemented in 
the Company. 
Main results of efforts to develop corporate 
culture in 2011 included:
• development of interactive communication 
platforms (the Corporate Forum, discussion 
sections on the Company’s intranet portal and 
in corporate media);
• development of work site attendance by man -
agers of all levels and communication with 
employees across levels within the Company;
• implementation of the ‘Gemba’ project (man -
agers spend time carrying out the functions of 
an ordinary employee in order to identify areas 
requiring improvement); 
• inclusion of discussion of corporate values in 
agendas for meetings between managers and 
workers and in agendas for quarterly meetings 
of business units.The tasks of corporate team building 
and creation of corporate culture 
are increasingly important as 
the scale of Gazprom Neft’s business 
grows. Meeting the challenges 
of our Company’s development 
strategy depends on the existence 
of a professional team with common 
values, common understanding of 
the tasks involved, and focus on 
efficiency and results. Development 
of corporate culture is a strategic 
priority for Gazprom Neft.  
The Corporate Code approved by 
the Company in 2011 defines key 
values as part of this culture.
Issues in this sphere figured on agendas at 
the Company’s Management Board meetings 
in 2011, including the extended meeting of 
the Management Board in September 2011.
A concept was designed in 2011 for further 
development of Gazprom Neft’s corporate 
culture, based on the Company’s mission and 
values and tailored to support the Company’s 
strategic goals. A study of corporate culture 
within the Company found that Gazprom Neft 
employees perceived corporate values as mean -
ingful and relevant. These values are supported 
by corporate employee relations and internal 
communications practices. The study also 
identified areas for development. In particular, 
employees said that it would be desirable to pro -
mote corporate values and relevant behaviour 
standards more broadly among personnel, and 
to show how they can be implemented in every -
day business at all levels of the Company.  It is important to instil a positive attitude towards 
leadership values, and to increase motivation 
and commitment to achieving results (not 
merely to corporate loyalty and rule follow -
ing). Evaluating the potential of employees and 
the match between their performance and 
Gazprom Neft’s corporate values must become 
an important part of the personnel assessment 
and development system.
Results of the study and interactive 
dialogue with personnel identified main tools 
for further development of the Company's 
corporate culture, including democratisation 
of corporate practices, development of goal-
specific management and internal competition, 
encouragement of initiatives ‘from below’, 
management through presence (regular at -
tendance at work sites by top managers), and 
personal involvement of the management team 
in transmitting corporate values.  CORPORATE CULTURE

The outcome of the workshop took the form 
of conclusions and proposals by the man -
ager-participants based on what they had 
learnt in their working day. These included 
ideas to address the problem of excessive 
workload and ways of improving communi -
cation between the operator and the filler. 
The participants noted that the experience 
gave them an understanding of how to opti -
mise the work process and motivate station 
employees to comply better with service 
standards, as well as a valuable direct contact 
with customers and an understanding of 
what additional services should be offered to 
motorists.49
24 The Japanese term ‘gemba’ means ‘the real place’. Today, the term is used in management to mean the work place or the place where value is created. The idea of ‘gemba’ 
practice is continuous improvement of any processes: if a need for changes arises, specialists should collect relevant data on site and suggest optimal changes.In summer and autumn 2011 a workshop was 
held at Gazprom Neft fuel supply enterprises 
using the ‘Gemba’24 methodology: heads of 
13 Company sales enterprises from various 
Russian regions and CIS countries took 
the work places of fillers, operators, deputy 
managers and managers a filling stations. 
The purpose of the workshop was to develop 
proposals on optimising the work of filling 
station employees and improving customer 
service quality. The workshop participants 
competed with each other on a range of cri -
teria to win nominations for ‘Best Idea’, ‘Best 
Participant’ and ‘Best Team’. The Gemba 
technique, which was devised in Japan and 
has won broad recognition worldwide, helps 
managers to obtain an objective picture of 
the situation at production sites, understand 
the problems faced by employees in their 
routine work, and unlock potential for better 
performance.

The system of corporate media available 
to stakeholders includes the Company’s 
website and websites of its subsidiaries and 
affiliates, as well as the corporate maga -
zine, Siberian Oil. The Company uses all 
standard communication tools, including 
press releases, press tours, conferences 
and round tables, competitions, exhibi -
tions, presentational events and materials 
about the Company, with special emphasis 
on the latest communication technologies. 
The corporate website was rebuilt in 2011, 
expanding its content and functionality and 
making it into a versatile tool for commu -
nication with various target audiences – 
media, the industry community, investors, 
stakeholders, financial analysts, suppliers, 
job applicants and others.Corporate communications are a key 
mechanism of stakeholder 
engagement. Gazprom Neft’s internal 
corporate communications system 
allows a constant dialogue with 
employees on topics and issues of 
relevance for the Company’s devel -
opment and of importance for its 
employees. The Company’s external 
communications contribute to devel -
oping a dialogue with external 
audiences for whom information on 
Gazprom Neft’s business is interesting 
or important and with whom 
the Company strives to build relation -
ships of trust and cooperation.
The internal communication system 
includes corporate media, regular meetings 
between Gazprom Neft management and 
employees, organisation of communal lei -
sure activities for employees (sports events, 
creative contests, festivals, etc., which help 
to develop team spirit). Up-to-date commu -
nication technologies within the Company 
enabling regular interactive conversation 
and prompt reaction to urgent issues. The 
content of internal corporate media is 
chosen to take account of the Company’s 
strategic priorities and the information 
needs of audiences. 
Surveys in 2011 showed that employees 
highly appreciate the work of Gazprom Neft 
corporate media, and the scope and timing 
of information provision. However, there 
were also suggestions that issues should be 
discussed with a  greater level of openness. In response to this request, the Company’s 
newspaper, Neftegazeta, began publication 
in 2011 of full responses by management to 
employee questions regarding a wide range 
of topics, from the Company’s strategy to 
specific managerial solutions. Amendments 
were made to the format of the Company’s 
2nd Corporate Forum in response to em -
ployee suggestions. In particular, open 
discussion time was increased by reduction 
of the time allocated for presentations by 
managers.
Key tasks for the Company's external 
communications are brand promotion and 
information support for Gazprom Neft busi -
ness in various regions. The Company uses 
a wide range of tools to communicate with

The practice of a Corporate Forums, which 
Gazprom Neft introduced in 2010, was 
continued in  2011. The Forums represent 
a new dialogue format: an informal meeting 
where management and employees discuss 
matters of importance and share opinions. 
The Forum is part of the Company’s new 
internal communications system based on 
a principle of “two-way traffic” – unhindered 
horizontal and vertical flow of information 
that allows everyone at the Company to 
receive information and to be heard.
The Forum has a special place in 
the internal communications system, 
because it is attended by representatives 
from all Group enterprises and employee 
groups, allowing them to obtain information 
‘at first hand’ and discuss any problem 
directly with senior management of 
the Company.Open and sincere dialogue at 
the first Forum was highly appreciated by 
employees. But what they appreciated 
most, and what ensured commitment to 
continuing the dialogue was prompt action 
by Company managers in response to 
the critical remarks and suggestions put 
forward at the Forum. Activity by employees 
in the ‘Questions to Management’ section 
of the corporate intranet portal came 
alive after the Forum and the practice of 
‘cascade briefings’ to convey corporate 
information to employees has been rapidly 
developed at many Company subsidiaries 
and affiliates. There was much interest in 
preparations for the next Forum in 2011 and 
employees used all available channels – 
the intranet portal, e-mail, and suggestion 
boxes installed in the workplace – to 
propose questions for discussion.  Questions were collected during a period 
of two months, ensuring that topics with 
most relevance to employees would be 
aired at the Forum and helping to make it 
successful. Delegations to the 2011 Forum 
came from all levels of management, and 
from all of the Company’s engineering and 
technical profiles, ensuring that information 
delivered at the Forum would be disseminated 
throughout the Company. The Forum 
gathered 350 delegates representing all 
Company enterprises and all regions of 
presence. Several of the proposals heard by 
the managers at the Forum are already being 
implemented, including ‘tours’ for employees 
to other enterprises within the Group. Changes 
will be made to arrangements for the third 
Forum based on the experience of the firsts 
two, including greater worker and engineer 
representation in Forum delegations.JSC GAZPROM NEFT

Information support for Gazprom Neft 
activities in its regions of presence 
remains a key priority for corporate 
communications. The Company worked 
closely with regional media in the re -
porting year. Company managers met 
with journalists and press tours were 
organised (to the Ety-Purovskoye field of 
Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz and to 
the Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery, where 
the new Izomalk-2 facility was displayed). 
The Company’s media group, Blagovest, 
which comprises a number of print 
media, as well as TV and radio channels, 
completed expansion of its coverage 
from the town of Noyabrsk to the whole 
of the Company’s production region in 
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. 
The Company’s openness at regional level 
ensured broad media coverage: Gazprom 
Neft and its subsidiaries were discussed in 
a total of 5,412 articles published by media 
in Omsk, Tomsk, Tyumen and Orenburg 
regions and in Khanty-Mansiysk and 
Yamalo-Nenets districts.
Advertising activities and sponsorship 
programs are designed to promote the im -
age of Gazprom Neft as a fast-growing, 
high-performing and socially responsible 
company, and to strengthen its market po -
sitions. In 2011, Gazprom Neft developed 
its advertising campaigns in the media 
and street advertising. The Company also 
continued its sponsorship of professional 
sports clubs, which offers a valuable tool 
for reaching target consumer audiences 
while helping sportsmen to achieve best 
results and promoting healthy lifestyles 
throughout society.A new record for monthly traffic on 
the Gazprom Neft website was set in 
November 2011, when Google Analytics 
counted more than 100,000 unique 
visitors (106,761 for the Russian version 
of the site). Total number of visits 
(197,397) and the number of pages 
viewed (544,769) set new records 
in the same month. Overall website 
traffic increased by more than 1.5 times  
in 2011 against 2010.Gazprom Neft is also implementing 
sponsorship programmes outside 
Russia. An exhibition of photographs 
by young Russian artists entitled 
‘Russia, New View 2011’ was held 
at Belgrade Fortress (Kalemegdan) 
with the support of Gazprom Neft, its 
Serbian subsidiary NIS and the Russian 
Embassy in Serbia. The exhibition is 
a part of a charity project to renovate 
the fortress, which is the principal 
symbol of the Serbian capital. The 
exhibition opening was timed to 
coincide with Serbia’s celebration 
of ‘Russia Day’. Gazprom Neft 
and NIS, together with Gazprom 
Export, also supported a concert in 
Belgrade by the New Russia State 
Symphonic Orchestra, at which 
works  by Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, and 
Shostakovich were performed under 
the baton of Yury Bashmet. < previous

SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
The Sustainable Development 
Report has become an important 
corporate communications tool 
for Gazprom Neft in recent years. 
The Company has published such 
Reports annually since 2007 
and since 2008 their preparation 
cycle has been synchronised with 
preparation of the Annual Report. 
The Company now has a joint 
working group for preparation of all 
its annual public reporting, which 
ensures the integration of reporting 
processes, consistent improvement 
of information quality, and a broad 
strategic context, showing the link 
between sustainability and economic 
value. Following global trends in 
corporate reporting and using 
the experience we have already gained 
in reporting integration, the Company 
plans to start publication of a single 
integrated Corporate Report in 
the near future.  The Company has studied and implement -
ed the sustainability reporting principles 
set out in the Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initia -
tive25. The Company strives to consistently 
improve the quality of this reporting.  
The methodical correctness of apply -
ing ‘Level B’ GRI Guidelines in preparing 
the Sustainable Development Report 2010 
was confirmed by GRI. When preparing 
the 2011 Report, the Company working 
group made an assessment of conformity 
of the Company’s sustainable development 
position with the provisions of ISO 26000 
and of application by the Company of 
the ethical aspects described in the Stan -
dard. Such internal assessment based 
on ISO 26000 is seen by the Company as 
indispensable for further improvement of 
our sustainability practice.

and new forms of education, support for 
small indigenous peoples in the Russian 
North, and preservation of biodiversity 
in offshore operations were also found 
to be important. These issues were also 
highlighted in the Report.
The 2011 Report gives more attention 
to sustainability governance and manage -
ment, as well as stakeholder engagement 
issues, and offers examples of Company 
response to the requests of specific 
groups. Presentation of the Company’s 
long-term goals is supplemented in 
the Report by the description of concrete 
and measurable goals.Priority issues for stakeholders 
were identified based on the analysis of 
feedback material, sociological studies 
and media monitoring, as well as through 
direct dialogue in specific spheres of 
Company business. Substantial priority 
issues in the reporting period included:
• the Company’s development strategy and 
development outlook; 
• competitiveness of products and services; 
• development of the corporate gover -

As of today, the headcount at Gazprom 
Neft enterprises is about 59,000 people 
working in more than 24 regions 
of Russia, and also in Kyrgyzstan, 
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Belarus, 
Serbia, Austria, and Italy. Ordinary 
workers represent 62% of personnel, 
while managers, specialists and office 
employees are 38%. Average age of 
employees is 38.The biggest share of Gazprom Neft 
personnel – a little under one third of 
the Company’s total headcount (29%) – 
work in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous 
District, where they are mainly employed 
at oil and gas production enterprises. Omsk 
Region accounts for 14% of Company 
personnel (38% of them work at the Omsk 
Refinery). The share of employees work -
ing in Saint Petersburg almost doubled in 
the reporting year compared with 2010 
due to relocation of the Group’s Corporate 
Centre from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. 
Some 5.5% of Company employees now 
work in Russia’s northern capital. Serbian 
NIS accounts for 16% of the Gazprom Neft 
headcount. Average headcount declined by 
9% in 2011 y-o-y due to business restructur -
ing and focus on core personnel: the Group 
partially disposed of its oil field service units 
and outsourced some of its production and 
refining functions, which reduced numbers 
of Gazprom Neft’s own employees. Much 
higher staff turnover rate in 2011 compared 
with 2010 (15.8% against 1.9%) is explained 
by these actions.DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY

Main principles of the Company’s 
staff policy are reflected in Gazprom 
Neft’s Corporate Code. The Company 
respects personal liberty, human rights 
and dignities, excludes any forms of 
discrimination and harassment and 
demands the same of its employees. 
Gazprom Neft consistently implements 
an equal opportunities policy, respects 
employee rights and provides equal 
opportunities for development of 
skills and abilities. All employees 
and job applicants are given equal 
opportunities to prove themselves. 
Human resource decisions are made 
purely on the basis on an employee’s 
qualifications, professional qualities, 
work achievements and the needs of 
the business.
All of the Company’s regulatory documents and 
programmes of social and employment relations 
as well as collective agreement are designed 
in strict compliance with the Constitution of 
the Russian Federation and Russian laws, includ -
ing the Russian Labour Code, and do not contain 
any provisions that allow unequal opportunities 
by gender, age or any other criteria that are not 
permitted by legislation (restrictions exist on 
employment of women and young people aged 
under 18 for heavy and hazardous work).
Company officials monitor and control 
compliance with labour law, and the Company 
exercises control over implementation of obliga -
tions under its Collective Agreement. 
The Company has adopted a Personnel 
Management Strategy up to 2020, which ensures 
alignment of human resource issues with general 
corporate strategy.  PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 
Sales units (aviation fuel and petro -
leum product supply enterprises) expe -
rienced strong growth in 2011, including 
purchase of new assets. New staff were 
recruited to sales enterprises purchased by 
Gazprom Neft in 2011.There will also be much opportunity for hori -
zontal career paths by Company employees 
(migration to other business divisions and 
learning of new skills). Internal candidates 
are prioritised when filling new jobs and 
internal rotation programs are among main 
activities of the Personnel Department: new 
deployment of employees who already have 
experience in the Company reduces recruit -
ment costs and adaptation periods.

The specifics of work with personnel vary 
between operating units. 
Strategy implementation is based on in -
troduction and step-by-step extension to all 
Group enterprises of a unified system of poli -
cies and standards governing the Company’s 
personnel management processes (staffing, 
personnel records, motivation and remu -
neration, development and training).
Work continued in 2011 to enhance 
the incentive and remuneration system 
and to develop the personnel performance 
management system.The Personnel Management Strategy is designed 
to combine optimal use of personnel for 
achievement of the Company’s goals with 
a system of tools to meet the socio-econom -
ic expectations, requirements and interests 
of employees. Mechanisms to implement 
the Strategy include recruitment and hiring, 
creation of a succession pool, management 
of benefit packages, employee performance 
evaluation, training and development cours -
es, and improving the efficiency of personnel 
management practices. At the same time, 
the Company tries to organise these activi -
ties in a way that ensures clear links between 
employee evaluation, development, hiring 
and staff rotation processes.PERSONNEL PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In 2011, a large-scale project 
was implemented to relocate 
the Company’s Corporate Centre 
from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. 
The Company arranged the move 
to a tight schedule: organisational 
changes and new local regulatory 
documents were designed and 
approved as necessary, and a schedule 
for relocation of organisational units 
was prepared. Special attention 
was given to design of a relocation 
compensation system. The Company 
was therefore able to retain its most 
valuable staff, minimising the stress 
associated with inevitable replacement 
of a part of Corporate Centre personnel.
Recruitment in Saint Petersburg 
was carried out quickly in order to 
ensure business continuity at all of 
the Company’s business divisions. 
The move was completed without 
delays within the target timeframes, 
and the new team had already 
started work in Saint Petersburg by 
December 2011.EMPLOYEE

Gazprom Neft places much emphasis on 
non-financial forms of employee motivation. 
The company has developed a non-financial 
motivation concept, and uses various approaches to 
ensure that employees feel valued by the Company, 
and that they understand the importance of their 
contribution to the success of the business.   
Such approaches include proficiency 
contests, sports competitions and 
recreational activities, as well as corporate 
communication sessions. 
The Company annually awards two 
kinds of labour distinctions: ‘Distinguished 
Employee of Gazprom Neft’ and ‘Gazprom 
Neft Veteran’. These titles are awarded as 
part of the corporate awards schedule and 
they are regulated by a special corporate 
standard.An important part of Gazprom Neft’s 
incentives system and HR brand27 is 
the Employer Value Proposition – a set 
of financial, professional and social 
benefits offered by the Company to its 
employees. The Value Proposition was 
developed through a dialogue, which 
identified the main value orientations and 
expectations of employees.  Its key components are the opportunity 
to work for a stable and fast-developing 
company offering excellent prospects 
for professional development and with 
a comprehensive corporate culture.
27  An HR brand is a company’s image as an attractive and responsible employer, its reputation among job applicants and employees. The HR brand reflects a company's 
corporate culture, its basic principles and values.JSC GAZPROM NEFT

SOCIAL GUARANTEES
The Company’s business units apply collective 
agreements and other rules and standards, 
which make various social benefits and pay -
ments available to employees over and above 
what they are entitled to under Russian law. 
Social benefits at most business units include 
voluntary medical insurance, insurance against 
accidental injury, meal payments, financial as -
sistance in case of urgent need, and other items. 
In 2011, the Company adopted a uniform system 
of social benefits that harmonized the list of ben -
efits and related procedures. Under the system, 
practically all business units in the Group will 
practice accident insurance starting from 2012. 
It is also intended that business units will switch 
to a uniform system of benefits in 2012-2014.
The collective agreement referring to vol -
untary medical insurance ensures that Company 
employees receive qualified consultations by 
doctors and treatment in the country's leading 
clinics. A corporate mortgage program has been 
set up in several regions to help employees 
purchase their own housing. The program offers 
reimbursement to the employee of a portion of 
mortgage loan interest.
Gazprom Neft is committed to team-build -
ing and encouragement of a healthy life style 
among its employees. A wide range of sports 
and recreational events are held every year at 
Company enterprises for this purpose, includ -
ing competitions between the sports teams of 
various subsidiaries.  About 1,800 employees 
took part in such sports events in 2011, which 
is 14% more than in 2010 . Events included tra -
ditional festivals of summer and winter sports 
(‘Spartakiada’), a football tournament between 
teams from Company refineries, and many 
others. In 2011 Gazprom Neft also took part 
for the first time in the Summer Spartakiada of 
OJSC Gazprom.Concern for veterans – both war vet -
erans and retirees with many years 
of service at the Company – is a tra -
ditional part of Gazprom Neft’s 
corporate culture. Veterans benefit 
from financial assistance, as well as 
involvement in  cultural and sports 
events. In 2011 the management 
and trade union committee of 
Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz 
delivered a package of New Year 
presents to veterans (a money pay -
ment of RUB 35,000, various food 
goods and commemorative souve -
nirs). Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery 
celebrated the 45th anniversary of

Design and implementation of social 
programs at Gazprom Neft is assisted 
by trade union organisations, which 
cooperate with the Company to address 
issues of professional, social and labour 
rights and protection of employees’ 
interests. The Company has an inter-
regional trade union organisation, 
which transmits employee response 
to the Company’s social and economic 
policies and helps in policy design. 
HR managers at subsidiaries hold regular 
meetings with trade union leaders, 
and a large gathering of HR managers 
and trade union representatives from 
subsidiaries and affiliates was held 
in Moscow Region in June 2011 to 
discuss relevant issues in all areas of 
personnel relations. The participants 
discussed development of the social 
benefit system, the ‘mobile personnel’ 
concept, development of professional 
competences, internal rotation opportu -
nities for specialists within the Company, 
and a number of other issues. The event 
included a meeting between trade union 
leaders and Vitaly Baranov, the Deputy 
Chairman of the Management Board with 
responsibility for administrative issues, 
to discuss interaction between trade 
unions and Company managers, new 
corporate policies in various regions and 
the Company’s HR standards.Mutual obligations of employees and 
the Company with respect to social and 
economic issues, industrial safety and 
employment matters are regulated by 
collective agreements. Standard collec -
tive agreements at Company subsidiaries 
contain a work safety section, which defines 
the responsibilities of employers and trade 
unions to put in place and oversee work 
safety measures and to monitor them. 
The section defines the responsibilities of 
work safety commissioners, members of 
commissions (committees) for work safety 
and trade union officials for creation of safe 
working conditions and prevention of inju -
ries and illness in the workplace. Collective 
agreements also regulate the balance 
between employer and employee interests 
during reorganisations and staff cuts, includ -
ing a minimum notice period28 before such 
actions are carried out.
Trade union organisations at Company 
enterprises devote much attention to 
youth issues, setting up youth commis -
sions to involve young employees in 
improvement of work conditions, accom -
modation and social conditions. The com -
missions design programs and proposals 
concerning the interests of young workers, 
which can be written into the relevant 
sections of collective agreements, as well 
as preparing and implementing adap -
tation programs for young recruits to 
the Company. The commissions also help 
to organise leisure activities for young 
workers, including entertainment, sport 
and recreational events. WORKING WITH TRADE UNIONS
The trade union’s youth relations 
commission at Gazprom Neft-
Omsk Refinery won a contest in 
2011 for youth councils at regional 
enterprises organised by the Omsk 
Trade Union Federation. Criteria 
applied in the competition included 
the number of young employees 
in a company’s trade union, social 
guarantees provided to young 
specialists, and involvement of 
the youth association in major events 
held both by the enterprise and by 
the Omsk Trade Union Federation.

TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT
The Company’s personnel development 
programs use common standards 
throughout Russia. Work continued in 
2011 to build a system of personnel 
training and development based on 
a corporate model of competences, 
and aligned with business objectives. 
Five modular corporate training 
programs were designed and launched 
during the year (a total of 25 have been 
implemented to date) and the corporate 
training matrix was extended.
Unique target programs that match 
strategies of the Company’s business units

training at Gazprom Neft. Such programs 
include:
• Development of Fields with Complex 
Geological Structure (25 persons trained, 
jointly with Shell Corporate University);
• Supervising in Drilling (26 persons trained 
at the Schlumberger Training Center);
• FivePlus (developing the competence 
of high-potential employees to fill top

The Company continued to develop its 
system of technical competence monitoring, 
which uses the results of employee testing to 
help plan future technical training programs. 
During the year, more than 200 position 
profiles were prepared in the oil refining seg -
ment, bringing the total number of profiles 
to 500. Increasing use is made of distance 
learning techniques. The share of employees 
who underwent some form of training in 
the course of the year grew by 0.1% in 2011 to 
0.85%, which is above the industry average.
New cooperation and partnership links 
have been forged with training providers 
in Saint Petersburg following relocation of 
the Company’s Corporate Centre to the city. 
Four Petersburg providers were added to 
the corporate program list in 2011.  The high level of qualification of 
Gazprom Neft specialists is con -
firmed by the results of prestigious 
professional competitions. In 2011, 
specialists at the Gazprom Neft 
subsidiary, Muravlenkovskneft, 
were among winners in the 12th na-
tional competition, ‘Engineer of 
the Year 2011’: the title ‘Professional 
Engineer of Russia’ was awarded 
to Marat Azamatov, the Company’s 
Deputy Chief Geologist (Head of 
the Department for Design and 
Monitoring of Well Interventions 
and Overall Production Planning); 
and Alexey Shorokhov, the Deputy 
Head of the Company Division for

It enables rapid appointment of well-qualified 
candidates to key posts and increases 
the share of internal appointments, which is 
a desirable outcome as internal candidates 
understand the Company and share its values. 
The succession pool ensures career op -
portunities for Company employees through 
individually-tailored programs for develop -
ment of their managerial and professional 
skills. A project is now being implemented 
for unified management of succession 
pools across all Company subsidiaries us -
ing common principles and rules and in 
2011 Gazprom Neft enacted a new version 
of the corporate standard, ‘Formation of 
a Common Succession Pool for Key Positions’, 
which establishes a more flexible and ef -
ficient approach to pool formation, includ -
ing optimisation of candidate nomination 
and appointment procedures. The revised 
standard allows employees to put themselves 
forward to join the succession pool: whereas 
previously an employee could only join 
the pool at the recommendation of a manager, 
the employee can now submit a request to 
be considered for specific jobs via the corpo -
rate portal. The succession pool contained 
1,373 employees in 2011. CREATING A  SUCCESSION POOL
Creation and development of 
a high-quality succession pool is 
a priority in HR management at 
Gazprom Neft. The Russian oil and 
gas industry faces very acute human 
resource issues at present, with 
a deficit of specialists throughout 
the management and value chain, 
from production to refining and sales. 
The succession pool uses career 
planning mechanisms to ensure 
that the Company has sufficient 
high-quality personnel and that jobs 
of key importance for Company 
development are appropriately filled. Special emphasis is placed on training 
and development of employees in 
the succession pool at the Company’s 
Serbian subsidiary, NIS, where financing 
of these activities more than doubled 
in 2011 compared with 2010. NIS 
also attributes much importance 
to cooperation with Serbian higher 
education establishments: the company 
has provided internship opportunities 
to students at relevant faculties of 
Belgrade and Novy Sad universities 
since 2010. More than 100 young 
professionals have joined NIS in the last 
two years. < previous

MANAGEMENT APPROACHES
The Company’s HSE work is in 
conformity with its corporate 
Policy on Industrial Safety, Labour 
and Environmental Protection  
and is coordinated at the level 
of the Corporate Centre by 
the Occupational Safety Department. 
The Department includes sections 
specialising in industrial and fire 
safety, work conditions, environmental 
issues, and special programs for civil 
defence and emergency management. 
Since June 2011 the Department 
has reported directly to the CEO 
of Gazprom Neft and relevant 
changes in subordination of HSE 
functions were also effected at all 
Company subsidiaries and affiliates. 
Company management believes 
that the reorganisation will improve 
the quality of HSE risk management.The Company has a collective body, 
the Industrial Safety, Labour and 
Environmental Protection Council, to 
enable discussion of the most important 
occupational safety issues, formulation of 
new strategic objectives and adjusting of 
current objectives. Council members are 
the managers of functional sub-divisions 
of the Occupational Safety Department 
and managers responsible for HSE at 
the Company’s major assets. An extended 
meeting of the Council was held in 2011 
with participation by the heads of services 
at various Company subsidiaries and repre -
sentatives from core business segments. 
The meeting discussed a plan for revision of 
the current occupational safety standards 
and development of new standards, based 
on suggestions for improvement which 
have been made. It was decided to revise 
eight standards and seven standards were 
put on a ‘to be developed’ list. The Council 
approved main criteria for evaluating HSE 
performance by subsidiaries in 2012.Scheduled work was continued in 
2011 for the establishment of an HSE 
management system in compliance with 
the approved corporate strategy.
Progress can only be achieved through 
the assessment of current efficiency and 
the setting of goals. Therefore in 2011 
the Company developed and successfully 
applied an Integral HSE Indicator, which 
tracks development of accident and injury 
rates, as well as success in implementation 
of fire safety, transport and environmental 
programs at subsidiaries. Indicators levels 
and progress was measured on a quarterly 
basis using the Azimut IT control system. 
This comprehensive approach gives a real -
istic picture of the HSE situation at an en -
terprise and enables timely correction 
by management when necessary. It was 
decided to continue use of the Integral 
Indicator in 2012.

corporate HSE Policies to all Gazprom 
Neft Group employees and third-party 
stakeholders.Gazprom Neft management believes that 
the HSE management system is a crucial 
element of efficient production control 
and is committed to the successful 
management of occupational risks 
related to impacts on employees' life 
and health, equipment, property, and 
the environment. No economic, technical 
or other considerations shall be taken

Gazprom Neft began to hold confer -
ences on occupational safety issues in 
2010 and a positive outcome encouraged 
the Company to make such conferences 
into regular events. Three corporate con -
ferences were held in 2011: on industrial 
safety and labour protection (March), fire 
safety (June), and environmental safety 
(November). Participants agreed that 
the conferences are an efficient means 
of exchanging information and experi -
ence, and for discussing relevant issues 
and plans. Representatives of Government 
supervisory agencies, other oil and gas 
companies, equipment manufacturers and 
suppliers always attend the conferences.Contractors that pass selection and win 
tenders must enter into an HSE agreement 
with Gazprom Neft detailing the rights and 
obligations of the parties regarding safety 
and security measures throughout the pe -
riod when work will be performed and ser -
vices provided, and defining coordination 
procedures for this period. At the end of 
the contract, the customer (Gazprom Neft) 
conducts a comprehensive assessment 
of the contractor’s occupational safety 
performance, which makes it possible to 
rank contractors and use the results for se -
lection purposes in the future. Accounting 
of contractor occurrences was carried out 
using the Azimut IT control system.Successful HSE management depends 
on regular audit to appraise the current 
state of the system and success in apply -
ing new mechanisms, and to design rec -
ommendations for improving the system. 
In 2011, the Company underwent an audit 
of the HSE management system audit at 
key oil production, refining and supply 
enterprises. The audit was conducted by 
groups of appropriately qualified auditors 
from various subsidiaries and affiliates 
operating in the Company’s core business 
segments. Subsidiaries and affiliates are 
took steps to improve management sys -
tems based on recommendations given 
after the audit. This work will be continued 
in 2012.
Sustainable functioning of the environ -
mental protection management system re -
quires appropriate staffing and Gazprom Neft 
takes professional training of employees 
in this sphere very seriously. The Company 
carries out regular workshops for managers 
and professionals who are responsible for 
environmental safety and waste manage -
ment. In 2011, 551 managers and specialists 
were trained in environmental safety and 
over 60,000 Company workers took classes 
in HSE standards.
The Company has implemented 
the corporate standard, ‘Procedure for 
Managing Contractors and Interactions in 
HSE and Civil Defense’, which was adopted 
in 2010. HSE issues are prioritised from 
the stage of selection of potential contrac -
tors. By using questionnaires and request -
ing information the Company defines 
the current HSE situation at a potential 
counterparty, identifies potential risks 
and screens any contractor, which ap -
pears inadequate by HSE criteria before 
any contractual relations are established. < previous

Protecting the environment and natural 
resources is an important objective of 
Gazprom’s business, and this applies to all 
the Company’s subsidiaries in all segments. 
Use of an integrated environmental management 
system enables enterprises to adhere to this 
principle in all aspects of their activities.
The environmental management system of 
Gazprom Neft Shipping LLC was certified 
in 2011, confirming that company’s cur -
rent environmental management system 
conforms to ISO 14001:2004 in respect of 
petroleum product transportation by sea 
and inland waterways, and cargo handling 
operations. Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery 
also underwent an audit to certify confor -
mity with the requirements of ISO 9001 
and ISO 14001. Based on the inspection, 
auditors concluded that the Refinery’s 
integrated management system was 
designed, implemented and maintained 
in accordance with the requirements of 
international standards.HSE management systems at 
Tomskneft VNK underwent a regular 
audit in 2011. A commission from Russian 
Certification Technologies, an authorised 
certification body, checked conformity of 
the enterprise with the requirements of 
ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007 
by inspecting its fields and facilities in 
the town of Strezhevoy. Technical facilities 
at Tomskneft oilfields were examined, 
documents were reviewed, and conversa -
tions were held with managers and employ -
ees at various levels. The auditors visited 
Tomskneft’s industrial safety, capital con -
struction and energy departments, as well as the environmental safety centre, civil 
defence division, oil production and  treat -
ment facilities and other organisational 
units. The inspectors also visited the town 
of Strezhevoy, the Sovetsko-Sosninskoye, 
Zapadno-Poludennoye fields, and 
the Pionerny and Vakh shift camps. The 
audit confirmed that the HSE management 
system at Tomskneft VNK meets interna -
tional standards. The audit was the fourth 
since international management standards 
were introduced at the company. The next

ROAD SAFETY
Gazprom Neft continues to implement 
measures for road safety, including the devel -
opment of regulatory documents, holding of 
road safety months at Company enterprises 
and staff trainings. This approach has yielded 
results in the form of rapid year-on-year 
declines in the number of traffic accidents, 
by 24% in 2010 and 34% in 2011.EMERGENCY READINESS
Gazprom Neft’s HSE Policy and standards are 
designed to minimise risks and prevent accidents. 
Priorities include creation of posts (staffing) for 
supervision of civil defence, improving manage -
ment team qualifications, individual response 
training for emergencies, and maintaining 
a high level of emergency readiness. Emergency 
prevention and response activities are based on 
action plans, which have already been developed, 
approved and implemented by subsidiaries and 
associates. Financial and material provisions in 
case of emergency are in place at subsidiaries and 
associates, and their levels of readiness for emer -
gency management is checked through regular 
exercises and training.The Company seeks to achieve ongoing 
improvement in levels of safety at work, 
consistently reducing rates of accident, 
injury and work-related illness.
INJURY PREVENTION
Implementation of a corporate HSE 
manage ment system and programs under 
the Company’s HSE Policy led to a major 
decline in the rate of fatal injury (by 38%) in 
2011. The Company has a corporate standard 
de fining the procedure for providing workers 
with personal protective equipment. Special 
clothing bought by the Company meets domes -
tic and European safety requirements. In 2011, 
the Company spent RUB 13,000 per employee 
to buy personal protective equipment.
Health and safety is an area of mutual 
responsibility and constructive relationships 
between the Company and trade unions. Mutual 
obligations regarding these issues are reflected 
in collective agreements and employee health 
programs. In the last three years, there has 
been a reduction in the number of employee 
evacuations from the work place due to illness 
requiring hospitalisation.

Rapid organisational and technical 
development, expansion of the opera -
tional assets of Company subsidiaries 
and associates, reassignment of tasks, 
functions and responsibility between 
them, and various other external and 
internal factors make it important to 
strengthen the management system for 
environmental safety and protection, 
and to implement approaches that 
comply with international best practice.
It is published on the Company’s website 
and is available at all subsidiaries and af -
filiates. Information on Policy realisation is 
also provided to external stakeholders.
In 2011, information on environmental 
aspects of operations by Gazprom Neft-
Omsk Refinery was presented to the First 
Regional Environmental Forum in Omsk 
Region. Refinery managers responded 
to the questions of local residents about 
measures to ensure environmental safety 
of operations.REDUCTION OF NEGATIVE  IMPACT ON
THE ENVIRONMENT & EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES
The environmental protection model, 
which the Company strives to achieve, 
addresses the tasks in Gazprom Neft’s HSE 
Policy in order to ensure a socially accept -
able level of environmental risk. Key prin -
ciples and mechanisms are defined as part 
of corporate environmental programs and 
projects. Control over risks associated 
with negative environmental impact of 
Company production facilities is exer -
cised at all stages, from risk identification 
to monitoring and control of preventive 
and corrective measures. Information on 
environmental security, implementation 
of environmental activities and changes to 
key environmental indicators are included 
in routine and regular reporting.
Enhancing competences, awareness 
and involvement of personnel across 
the entire production chain is an important 
driver for successful realisation of HSE pro -
grams. The Company’s Policy in this field 
has been communicated to all employees. A rating by Interfax International 
Information Group of enterprises 
in Russia and Kazakhstan found 
the Yaroslavl Refinery, Slavneft-
YaNOS, to be the leader in its region by 
criteria of environmental and energy 
transparency. Slavneft-YaNOS received 
an index score of 99.5%, putting it 
in first place among 49 production 
enterprises in Yaroslavl Region and 
among the Top-10 enterprises in Russia. 
The rating compares enterprises using 
essential indicators of environmental 
friendliness and energy efficiency 
of their production processes. 
Voluntary information disclosure 
by the companies for purposes of 
the rating shows willingness and 
ability to take responsibility for their 
environmental performance and to 
engage in a dialogue with the public.Assessment of the environmental 
impact of enterprise operations, 
evaluation of management systems 
and of the efficiency of environ -
mental activities is an integral part 
of work to improve environmen -
tal security. One such program is 
the ‘Comprehensive environmen -
tal survey of site and facilities at 
Gazprom Neft-Moscow Refinery’, 
which began in August 2011 and 
aims to obtain reliable and objective 
information on the environmental 
situation at the Moscow Refinery. 
The program is identifying past and

The Company spent RUB 979.2 mn on 
disposal of production and consumption 
waste in 2011. The money was spent on 
integrated maintenance and management 
of industrial and household waste landfills, 
elimination of sludge pits and reclamation 
of oil-contaminated land, collection and 
disposal of waste, and transfer of waste 
for disposal and decontamination by other 
organisations.
Statutory payments for negative 
impact on the environment were reduced 
by RUB 211.1 mn in 2011 compared with 
2010 thanks to environmental protection 
measures carried out by the Company.  SPENDING ON ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY  
& PROTECTION 
Gazprom Neft is implementing a set of 
actions for consistent reduction of nega -
tive impacts on the environment, guided 
by an integrated policy with emphasis 
on conformity to environmental require -
ments, effective planning, and integration 
of environmental measures with Company 
operations throughout the production 
chain. The Company’s subsidiaries and 
affiliates have approved their own envi -
ronmental safety programs that include 
various activities for rational use of natural 
resources and environmental protection.
Realisation of these programs in 2011 
required considerable spending on devel -
opment and implementation of innova -
tive technologies, upgrade of production 
equipment, preparation of environmental, 
regulatory and procedural documents, 
conduct of environmental control and 
monitoring, management of production and consumption waste, raising qualifica -
tions and providing training for specialists, 
making statutory payments to compen -
sate negative impact on the environment, 
as well as other environment-related 
activities.
A large part of capital costs were 
spent on construction and renovation of 
landfill sites for industrial and household 
solid waste (Gazprom Neft-Vostok LLC in

Projects as part of the Company’s associ -
ated gas program include construction of 
gas-collecting systems and gas-processing 
plants, and development of transport. 
The Noyabrsk integrated project, which 
began in 2011, will enable utilisation of 
an extra 1–1.2 bln m3 of associated gas per 
year through simultaneous expansion of 
gas transportation capacities by Company 
subsidiaries and of gas refining capacities by 
SIBUR Holding in the Noyabrsk area. A gas 
pipeline from the Severo-Yangtinskoye field 
to the Muravlenko Gas-processing Plant has 
been completed and is ready for launch, and 
will enable additional utilisation of about 
20 mn m3 of gas in 2012. Construction of 
a 35-km gas pipeline for associated gas 
supply from the Shinginskoye field to 
Luginetskaya Gas Compressor Station was 
completed in December 2011 and will en -
able delivery of up to 55 mn m3 per year by 
Gazprom Neft-Vostok LLC.  Increase of payments for harmful atmo -
spheric emissions compared to 2010 reflected 
the start of operations by Muravlenkovskneft 
(a branch of Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegaz) 
at new fields, where levels of associated gas 
utilisation were below targets, as well as 
acquisition and construction of new assets in 
the sales segment.
Gazprom Neft processes project environ -
mental documents in a timely fashion, and 
carries out industrial control and environmen -
tal impact monitoring to ensure compliance 
with environmental legislation, and with 
the Company’s own regulatory and proce -
dural documents, and to achieve consistent 
reduction of negative environmental impact. 
Programs for preventive and corrective mea -
sures are updated on the basis of environmen -
tal monitoring results.ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIONS
Expansion of operations, new field launches 
and acquisition of new industrial  assets tend 
to increase gross atmospheric emissions. 
Technologies for minimising such emissions 
are therefore highly relevant.
Gazprom Neft’s exploration and produc -
tion enterprises implement various ongoing 
measures to reduce emissions of pollutants 
into the atmosphere. Measures include as -
sociated gas utilisation programs, overhaul 
of fixed assets (pumping equipment, gas 
pipelines, tanks, flares and furnaces), use of 
special measurement equipment to gauge 
emissions from stationary sources, etc. 
Associated gas utilisation in 2011 (including 
joint ventures) stood at 64.5%, compared 
with 60.4% in 2010. The increase reflects 
implementation of investment projects in 
associated gas transportation and utilisation 
as well as expanding refinery capacities of 
Company partners.

USE OF WATER RESOURCES
The Company took various steps to raise 
the efficiency of water resource utilisa -
tion in 2011. Facilities with treatment 
capacity of 125 m3/hour were built and 
commissioned in stage one of a program 
to upgrade treatment facilities at Gazprom 
Neft-Omsk Refinery (purified and decon -
taminated residential sewage is useable 
as a water input for industrial processes). 
Work was also carried out to retrofit 
treatment facilities at the Mendeleyev 
Refinery in Yaroslavl, and cooling towers 
at the YaNOS Refinery underwent a major 
overhaul. The measures improved water 
supply arrangements at these business 
units and helped to reduce their water 
intake.
Exploration and production enterpris -
es took measures to increase the safety of 
underwater pipeline crossings and pipe -
lines installed above water courses. R&D 
work was carried out to justify adjustment 
of regional standards for permissible re -
sidual oil content in soils with usable water 
resources, as well as adjustment of maxi -
mum permissible oil and petroleum prod -
uct content in the beds of surface water 
bodies in Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous 
District. This work will provide a scientific 
rationale for maximum permitted oil and 
petroleum product content in soils and 
the beds of surface water bodies, which 
will help to improve the efficiency of envi -
ronmental actions.Another utilisation project is being 
implemented jointly with SIBUR Holding at 
the southern license area of the Priobskoye 
field (Gazprom Neft-Khantos LLC). The whole 
facility consisting of four units is scheduled 
for start-up in Q4 2012.
Lowering of atmospheric emissions 
from refineries in 2011 was due to: installa -
tion of up-to-date floating-roof equipment 
at the product storage facilities of Gazprom 
Neft-Omsk Refinery and Slavneft-YaNOS 
(reduction of benzol and xylene emissions); 
upgrade of units for utilisation of coke drum 
steam (reduction of hydrogen sulphide 
emissions) and covering of oil remov -
ers at the recirculated water supply unit 
(reduced emissions of hydrogen sulphide, 
benzol, xylene, phenol and amylenes) 
at Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery. Design 
work was carried out for an automatic air monitoring station at the Gazprom Neft-
Moscow Refinery. Gazprom Neft sales 
enterprises of the Company carried out work 
to prepare project documents and obtain 
permits, licenses, and approvals for newly 
acquired, constructed and renovated assets.  
They also deployed a new system for 
gasoline vapour recirculation during vehicle 
refuelling by customers, fitted filters to 
breather valves on reservoirs, and carried 
out laboratory and aerodynamic testing of 
ventilation systems. 
Gazprom Neft-North-West developed and 
manufactured a prototype for a petroleum 
product vapour recovery unit with high ab -
sorption efficiency to be used at filling stations 
as part of work by the Company to analyse 
the environmental and economic impact of 
vapour recovery systems at retail facilities.
In 2011, Gazprom Neft became the first 
Russian oil company to transfer emission 
reduction units (ERUs, each representing 
1 t of СО2), obtained in conformity with 
the established procedure for implemen -
tation of the Kyoto Protocol mechanism 
in Russia, from the Russian national 
register to that of another country. This 
occurred when the Company transferred 
about 295,000 ERUs, obtained in August-
December 2009, from the Russian Carbon 
Unit Registry to Japan’s National Carbon 
Unit Registry as part of a joint project under 
the Kyoto Protocol at the Ety-Purovskoye 
field. The ERUs will be purchased by a major 
European energy company. The work 
started in 2010 and the project partners 
are Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Oil 
Corporation (Japan).A gas-turbine power plant with 
12 mW capacity was brought into 
operation in 2011 by Tomskneft at 
the Igolsko-Talovoye field. The plant, 
which cost about RUB 870 mn to 
build, will ensure sustainable power 
supply for company facilities at fields 
of the Vasyuganskaya group and will 
be fuelled by associated gas from 
the Igolsko-Talovoye, Karayskoye 
and Tagayskoye fields in Tomsk 
Region. Completion of repair work 
at two other existing gas turbine 
units will raise associated gas use in 
the Region to 79 mn m3 per year and 
the utilisation rate will increase.< previous

Government Technical Regulations, 
‘On requirements for automotive and aviation 
gasoline, diesel and marine fuel, jet fuel and 
heating oil’ were enacted in 2008. According 
to the Regulations, Russian refineries must fully 
change to production of fuels complying with 
environmental Class 4 (corresponds to Euro-4) 
from 2015, and Class 5 (corresponds to Euro -5) 
from 2016. All of Gazprom Neft’s refineries 
in Russia were producing Class-4 fuel in 2011 
(a year ahead of the Government deadline).The Omsk Refinery started production of fuel 
conforming to Class 4 under the Technical 
Regulations at the beginning of 2011. All of 
the Refinery’s SuperEuro-98 gasoline now 
fully conforms to Euro-5 requirements. 
Annual output of SuperEuro-98 gasoline is 
more than 88,000 t.
Commissioning of the catalytic cracking 
gasoline and diesel fuel hydrotreatment 
facility at Omsk will enable changeover of 
other fuel grades to higher environmental 
classes (Premium-Euro-95 and AI-92), which 
match the Technical Regulations and are in 
strong demand on the market.
The Omsk Refinery will make a complete 
transition to gasoline and diesel production 
in conformity with Classes 4 and 5 as early 
as 2012, when the new units reach design 
capacity. This will improve the environmental 
situation in regions, which are supplied by 
the Omsk Refinery (mainly the Siberian 
and Ural Federal Districts), and will help to 
increase the market share of Omsk Refinery 
products.OMSK REFINERY

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011
Gazprom Neft's third Russian refinery, Slavneft-
Yaroslavnefteorgsintez (YaNOS), operated by 
the Company in conjunction with TNK-ВР, was 
the first in Russia to start production of Euro-4 
diesel fuel: the Refinery began production of 
diesel fuel with 50 ppm sulphur content in 2005 
and production of environmentally friendly diesel 
fuel with ultra-low 10 ppm sulphur content began 
in January 2007.
Construction of two new process installations 
was completed in 2011: an isomerisation 
unit for straight-run gasoline fractions and 
a hydrotreatment unit for catalytic cracking 
gasoline. They will enable production of high-
octane components, such as isomerate and 
catalytic cracking gasoline with low sulphur 
content conforming to Class-4 and Class-5 
requirements. The isomerisation unit has annual 
input design capacity of 480,000 t, and capacity 
of the gasoline hydrotreatment unit is 870,000 t. 
YaNOS expects to complete construction 
of the first block of a new 3 mn t diesel fuel 
hydrotreatment unit 1.5 mn t annual capacity at 
the start of 2013. The block is designed to produce 
Class-5 diesel fuel.The Moscow Refinery began producing Class-4 
gasoline and diesel fuel in 2011 following 
equipment upgrades. Catalyst reactivation 
in the LCh-35–11/1000 Catalytic Reforming 
Unit enabled steady production of high-
octane gasoline components, and loading of 
the hydrotreatment unit with a catalyst made by 
the company Haldor Topsoe enabled production 
of diesel fuel with sulphur content below 
50 ppm. The Moscow Refinery now produces 
about 180,000 t of high-octane gasoline per 
month, of which more than 60,000 t is in Class 
4, as well as 100,000 t of graded diesel fuels. 
Construction of a Penex light gasoline fractions 
isomerisation unit and a hydroforming unit for 
catalytic cracking gasoline is now in progress 
and their launch in 2013 will make all engine 
gasoline outputs compliant with Classes 4 and 
5. Changeover to Class-5 standards in diesel 
fuel production is happening in two stages: all 
diesel supplies to the Moscow market are already 
Class-4 compliant, and completion of the new 
diesel fuel hydroforming unit in 2014 will make all 
diesel outputs comply with Class 5.85

The upgrade program being implemented 
at the three refineries will enable changeover to 
production of Class-4 and -5 motor fuels within 
the set time limits as well as increasing the depth 
of refining and reducing environmental impact of 
operations Total cost will be about RUB 346 bn in 
the period up to 2020. 
Similar programs are also being implemented 
at the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. In 2011, 
the Pancevo Refinery in Serbia started work on 
a hydrocracking and hydrotreatment complex, 
which is scheduled for launch in 2012. It will boost 
refining output and depth at Pancevo, producing 
more environmentally friendly fuel with low 
sulphur content.< previous

rate the waste into natural processes and 
reduce reclamation costs. Scientific solu -
tions that can achieve these objectives are 
of great importance:  in 2011, the Company began work on a document that details 
future work to design, construct and oper -
ate sludge pits and to develop a technol -
ogy for conversion of drilling waste into 
soil material. Criteria are being developed 
to identify locations and instances where 
breakdown and disappearance of waste 
can be allowed to occur naturally. These 
documents will contribute to the efficien -
cy of work for elimination and reclamation 
of sludge pits.WASTE MANAGEMENT
Most of the waste generated by explora -
tion and production operations is drilling 
sludge, and efficient management of this 
waste is one of the Company’s main envi -
ronmental tasks. A comparative analysis 
of the efficiency of various biological 
agents was carried out in 2011 to deter -
mine the best technology for elimination 
of sludge.
Company subsidiaries carry out 
obligatory work for reclamation of 
land disturbed and contaminated 
by their operations. Gazprom Neft 
has set the goal of removing all 
long-standing sludge pits in its 
operating regions by 2013. As part 
of this program 138 sludge pits 
were reclaimed in Yamalo-Nenets 
Autonomous District, Khanty-
Mansiysk Autonomous District and 
Tomsk Region during 2011. Also, 
starting from 2011, new sludge pits 
will be eliminated immediately after 
completion of drilling work.
The Company strives to ensure 
the transparency of its environmen -
tal programs for all stakeholders. 
In August 2011 Gazprom Neft-
Noyabrskneftegaz invited journal -
ists to learn more about its land 
reclamation program: journalists 
visited the West-Noyabrskoye and

Sciences held a regular meeting of its ex -
pert advisory group for preservation and 
study of walrus populations in the south-
eastern part of the Barents Sea. The 
group was set up by the Marine Mammals 
Council with the assistance of World 
Wildlife Fund (WWF) Russia in 2009. The 
group is comprised of representatives 
from environmental and scientific organ -
isations, public authorities, and oil and 
gas companies which are carrying out or 
plan to carry out offshore operations in 
this region. Specialists of Gazprom Neft’s 
Industrial Safety Department are active 
participants in the group. Joint efforts by 
the Marine Mammals Council, Gazprom 
Neft and WWF Russia have enabled stud -
ies on the habitats of the Atlantic Walrus, 
which is considered to be a particu -
larly vulnerable species and is listed in 
the Russian ‘Red Book’ of endangered

in the Pechora Sea, vulnerable species 
and main anthropogenic factors were 
identified, and proposals were developed 
for minimising environmental impact 
from Company activities in the region. 
During the meeting, the expert advisory 
group gave a positive evaluation of its 
relationship with Gazprom Neft, and it 
was decided to continue the cooperation

Company expansion and the launch of 
new capacities entail increasing needs 
for electricity. The Company is working 
to improve oil recovery and upgrade 
refining capacities, while making opera -
tions less electricity-intensive. Company 
business units have initiated programs 
to develop their own power generating 
infrastructure and rational use of energy 
as a part of Gazprom Neft’s unified 
strategy for development of operations. Energy saving is a strategic priority of 
Gazprom Neft, and the energy compo -
nent in unit production costs is being 
reduced through medium-term programs 
to raise energy efficiency. ENERGY CONSUMPTION & ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Various environmental safety actions are 
planned for 2012 to develop and implement 
new technology solutions, reclaim oil-
polluted land (taking account of the specifics 
of terrain and soil composition), and 
address the problem of sludge pits. Efforts 
to reduce air pollution will be focused on 
reduction of associated gas flaring: increase 
of associated gas utilisation will be attained 
through a portfolio of projects, some to 
be implemented in 2012, including launch 
of new facilities at the South-Priobskaya 
Compressor Station and a new gas pipeline 
from the North-Yangtinskoye field to 
the Muravlenko Gas-processing Plant.
Reduction of negative environmental 
impact from refinery operations will be 
achieved through upgrading programs 
and improvement of existing processes at 
all of the Company’s refineries, increasing 
the share of more environmentally friendly 
fuels in total outputs, as well as implementing 
up-to-date gas emission and sewage water 
treatment technologies, and disposing of 
generated and accumulated waste.Gazprom Neft plans to pursue its 
programs to improve performance in 
HSE and civil defence during 2012. 
Scheduled work for implementation of 
the integrated HSE management system 
in 2012 includes activities to review 
efficiency and to adjust the system, as 
well as establishment of a mechanism for 
making adjustments and improvements 
to the system and to work processes in 
the future. Comprehensive evaluation of 
the HSE situation at enterprises will be carried 
out using (among other tools), the integral 
HSE performance indicator, which was 
developed in 2011. Work will continued in 
2012 for audit of HSE management systems at 
oil production, refining and supply enterprises, 
and to revise the current and design new 
HSE standards. Development of seven new 
standards is scheduled for 2012.
Further reductions in rates of injury and 
work-related disease will be achieved by a set 
of corrective activities based on the results 
of inspections, audits and risk assessments, 
and also through development of industrial 
safety training for personnel.OUTLOOK: PLANS FOR 2012
• As one of Russia’s leading oil compa -
nies Gazprom Neft makes every effort 
to improve energy efficiency. About 
65% of total energy consumption 
by production enterprises is for oil 
production by means of submersible 
centrifugal pumps (SCPs), so improv -
ing the energy characteristics of SCPs 
can deliver huge savings. Specialists of 
Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz have 
therefore made use of an energy-sav -
ing submersible pump unit: pilot tests 
promised energy efficiency improve -
ments by 20-25% in oil production and 
the new unit was put to work at a well 
in the Mid-Iturskoe field in April 2011, 
where it provided a substantial cut in 
energy consumption without reducing 
production levels. The technology 
was developed by a Russian company, 
NOVOMET. By the end of 2011, 69 wells 
were using these energy efficient 
valve-driven pumps, and average 
energy savings per well were 22%. 
Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz 
plans to deploy 200 more of the new 
SCPs at its Muravlenkovskneft operat -
ing unit in 2012.
• NIS has established a new Energy 
business unit in order to develop 
company potential in the hydropower, 
biofuel and other renewable energy 
segments. A number of highly-quali -
fied EU specialists have been hired to 
work in the new business unit. < previous

Gazprom Neft will continue to engage 
with governmental, expert and public 
organisations as part of its HSE efforts, and 
will call on representatives of these groups 
to gauge the success of the Company’s 
efforts to reduce environmental impacts and 
to assess the Company’s own methods for 
measuring progress. Work will also continue in the field 
of energy saving and efficiency to create 
a constantly functioning mechanism, 
consisting of an energy management 
system, external and internal power 
supply systems, and various energy-saving 
measures as part of medium-term energy

In 2011, Gazprom Neft signed socio-
economic cooperation agreements with 
Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District and 
with Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. 
These regions are of strategic importance 
for the Company’s development: KhMAD 
accounts for about a half of the Company’s 
consolidated crude oil production, and Yamal 
is where Gazprom Neft’s new major production 
projects are focused. Building stable and 
long-term relationships with the Governments 
of Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenets 
Autonomous Districts is an important driver of 
the Company’s success. Under the agreements, 
Gazprom Neft will continue to assist projects 
for socio-economic development of these 
regions and improvement of the quality of life 
of local people.Gazprom Neft and KhMAD are working 
together to stimulate investment activity 
in the District and to create favourable 
conditions for further geological survey -
ing. An understanding has been reached 
to carry out joint work for implementation 
of environmental programs and proj -
ects to develop scientific and technical 
potential in the District. The agreement 
with KhMAD calls for Gazprom Neft to 
help finance construction of educational 
institutions and develop social infrastruc -
ture in the District. Specific objects of 
financing include pre-school institutions 
and major cultural events. 
Measures under the socio-economic 
development agreement between 
Gazprom Neft and YaNAD contribute to 
sustainable development of the Company 
and strengthening the region’s com -
petitiveness. In 2012, a skills centre will 
be created on the basis of production 
enterprises in the towns of Noyabrsk and

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011contents
Vyborg is a unique town in Leningrad 
region, famous for its ancient castle 
and other medieval buildings. But 
until recently very few people knew 
that a wooden town dating from 
the 15th-17th centuries – complete 
with  houses, streets, household 
goods, coins and decorations – lies 
buried beneath the Vyborg we see 
today. Archaeologists discovered 
a zone near a medieval house where 
layers from the beginning of the 15th 
to the 19th were particularly well 
preserved, offering a rare opportunity 
to explore the yard of a house at 
the time when the house was built in 
the 16th century, and also in previous 
and subsequent periods. Usual 
practice at that time was to build 
town houses without intervening 
space, making it virtually impossible 
to find another such medieval yard 
in Europe. Thanks to Gazprom Neft, 
which sponsored the excavations 
in 2011, the archaeologists found 
a number of interesting artefacts, 
including household items, clasps 
and rare coins. Medieval trading 
seals – the first ever found in 
the town – are of particular interest 
from a scientific point of view. Items 
of Swedish and German origin found 
by the archaeologists in Vyborg 
prove that the town was actively 
involved in the Baltic trading system 
and represented a cultural cross-
roads. The findings call for revision of 
previous assessments of the town’s 
early history and suggest that Vyborg 
should be ranked with such medieval 
urban centres as Tallinn, Tartu, Riga, 
Hamburg and Lubeck.of Company business in Saint Petersburg, 
which is one of the leading centres of 
Russian and world culture, makes it 
natural that the Company should support 
cultural heritage and research initiatives 
in that city. As part of its cooperation with 
Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Region in 
2011 Gazprom Neft supported restoration 
projects for the Commandant's Pier (part of 
the Peter and Paul Fortress) and the build -
ing of the Russian Geographical Society, 
as well as providing funds to the Institute 
for the History of Material Culture (part 
of the Russian Academy of Sciences) for 
archaeological excavations in the town of 
Vyborg.
Support for traditional life styles 
of indigenous peoples in the Russian 
North  is another important aspect 
of the Company’s regional policy. In 
the framework of socio-economic agree -
ments, Gazprom Neft enterprises provide 
ethnic populations and households with 
building materials and workwear, transfer 
funds for purchase of food stuffs, and 
provide outboard engines, chain saws and 
snowmobiles. The Company’s subsidiar -
ies – Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz 
and Muravlenkovskneft – are the tradi -
tional sponsors for the ‘Day of the Reindeer 
Herder’, which is a traditional national 
holiday for the local peoples in Yamalo-
Nenets and Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous 
Districts. Traditional sports at the celebra -
tions in 2011 included reindeer racing, 
jumping over sledges, and tug of war. 
Prizes to contest winners were Buran 
snowmobiles provided by Gazprom Neft 
enterprises.
Another important project that 
received Company financing in 2011 was 
repair of the road between Tara, Egorovka, 
and Litovka, which is an important part of 
the infrastructure of the Russian North and also spends substantial amounts to build 
sports and recreational facilities and mini-
stadiums, which make physical culture 
and sport into a part of everyday life for 
its employees and the general public in 
regions of Company operations. The sports 
complexes in Noyabrsk and Tarko-Sale and 
the program for construction of open-
access sports grounds in Yamalo-Nenets 
Autonomous District offer excellent ex -
amples of such social investments. These 
sports grounds have high-tech surfaces, 
which have been specially developed for 
year-round use: the hard surface for sum -
mer sports is resistant to rain and snow, 
and can be covered with water for ice 
sports in the winter. The sports grounds 
are equipped for 12 sports, ranging from 
mini-football to badminton. The Company’s 
program for creation of sports grounds 
began with the opening in September 
2011 of the first all-purpose ground with 
an artificial surface in Microdistrict No. 7 
in Noyabrsk. 
The Company gives special attention 
to children’s sport and is the organiser of 
the Gazprom Neft Cup, which is an annual 
tournament of children’s ice-hockey teams 
as part of the Continental Ice-hockey 
League (KHL). The tournament received 
the status of the official KHL children’s 
tournament in 2011, so children’s teams 
representing the strongest KHL clubs 
congregated in Omsk in the reporting year 
to take part in it. Master classes for young 
ice-hockey players, meetings with profes -
sional clubs stars, and contests for best 
technical and physical preparedness take 
place alongside official matches as part of 
the tournament. 
Preservation and care for historical 
and cultural monuments  are also im -
portant components of Gazprom Neft’s 
corporate culture. Strong development < previous

GREATER EFFICIENCY OF SOCIAL 
ACTIVITIES IN RUSSIAN REGIONS   
financed the purchase of ozone water 
treatment systems for kindergartens and 
creation of a recreation area on the River 
Taz embankment in Krasnoselkup. 
Shortage of places in pre-school 
facilities is another key social problem in 
Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District, 
and the District has been implementing 
a special program since the second half of 
2010 to address the problem.  Efficiency of the Company’s social activity 
in the regions depends on fine tuning of 
its social programs and projects to match 
priority regional development objectives 
and compliance with regulatory require -
ments. The Company has a system for 
regular monitoring of the socio-economic 
situation in Russian regions, which keeps 
track of the most urgent issues, events 
and problems, as well as a program for 
monitoring of regional legislation. These 
mechanisms enable efficient management 
of social and legal risks and identify 
priority social objectives that will assist 
development of Company business in 
specific regions. 
Monitoring of the situation in the regions 
was carried out daily in 2011 and the results 
enabled timely adjustment of current 
projects and design of new proposals. For 
example, monitoring results in the second 
half of 2011 justified amendments to 
the list of social projects being imple -
mented in the territory of Krasnoselkup 
district of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous 
District under the relevant socio-economic 
agreement: Gazprom Neft additionally However, additional efforts have proved 
necessary and meetings were held 
between the Deputy CEO of Gazpromneft, 
Alexander Dybal, and the District Governor 
to find a solution as part of the Company-
District cooperation agreement: 
construction of a modern pre-school 
education centre is now planned in the city 
of Khanty-Mansiysk at the expense of 
Gazprom Neft.

Communication support for Company 
participation in regional socio-economic 
development was broadened in 2011. Main 
activities of Gazprom Neft in this sphere 
are regularly highlighted by the Company’s 
media outlets, including materials on 
the Company’s social policy and other 
programs reflecting the Company’s 
assumption of its social responsibilities. Gazprom Neft also uses its media capacity 
in regions to obtain and carefully analyse 
feedback. Stakeholder engagement in 
the regions has also been developed 
through intensive cooperation to resolve 
socially relevant issues. < previous

JSC GAZPROM NEFT
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011
Stakeholder engagement is an  important 
component of social project development 
and implementation. The Company has 
created and tested a model for involvement 
of stakeholders in implementation of regional 
sustainable development initiatives. This model includes:
• diagnostics of the situation and identifying 
the relevant circle of stakeholders;
• involvement of the stakeholders in 
dialogue, and in the design, promotion and 
implementation of decisions;
• joint assessment of results and planning of 
further initiatives.
The example of the project for creation 
of healthy life-style infrastructure in 
Noyabrsk can serve as an example of model 
implementation, as shown below.
Project results:
• The project had strong support from 
residents: polling showed that 91% 
of Noyabrsk residents are in favour of 
the development.
• The new sports grounds were used to 
capacity in 2011. The average number of 
persons training in the mini-stadiums is 
130 per day (about 46,000 single visits 
per year).
• Based on data of the town Sports 
Committee on usage levels, the number 
of people involved in sports will increase 
by 9,000, that is by 75%, from 12,000 to 
21,000 residents or from 12% to 20% of 
the population within one year and solely 
at the facilities, which have been launched 
to date. 
• A joint program of the Company and 
the town administration has been prepared 
for the development of town sports 
infrastructure.104

The program is based on a balanced ap -
proach, which connects the Company’s 
regional policy priorities and the regions’ 
own social priorities. CHARITY DEVELOPMENT
APPLYING THE MODERN METHODS OF 
CHARITY ORGANISATION 
The Company encourages employee 
participation in charity actions, both in 
fund raising and by taking part individu -
ally in donor and volunteer programs and 
the activities of the Company’s Charity 
Commission.
The practice of corporate volunteer -
ing developed rapidly at Gazprom Neft 
in 2011. Voluntary participation by 
employees in social programs increases 
the impact of corporate charity: volunteer 
support gives more than welfare assis -
tance, since it offers the additional value 
of a caring human attitude. Volunteer 
programs are also important for the volun -
teers and the Company.   A ceremony to market completion 
of the Federal Scientific-Clinical 
Centre of Paediatric Haematology, 
Oncology and Immunology was held 
in Moscow on June 1 (Children’s Day) 
with the assistance of the Gift of Life 
Fund. Gazprom Neft rendered finan -
cial assistance to the Fund for pur -
chase of medical equipment (a BN 
ProSpec analyser and incubators). 
The Prime Minister of the Russian 
Federation Vladimir Putin took part 
in the opening ceremony.

Volunteer projects enable employees to 
manifest qualities, which are not al -
ways called for at work, to receive moral 
satisfaction from acts of kindness, and 
to develop additional team skills. For 
the Company volunteer programs are valu -
able as a tool for promoting responsibility 
and team work, strengthening corporate 
culture and for enhancing motivation and 
creativity. Participation in such programs 
by Company top management is a particu -
larly important motivational factor.
The employees of the Corporate 
Centre and of all subsidiary and associ -
ate companies took part in volunteer and 
donor programs in 2011. The following 
events were held:
• ‘Prepare a Child for School’ (purchase of 
books and stationery for orphanages);
• ‘Letter to Father Frost’ (New Year gifts 
from Father Frost in response to  letters 
from orphanage children: in 2011 em -
ployees at the Corporate Centre made 
the wishes of 178 children at Orphanage 
No. 11 in Saint Petersburg come true);
• ‘The Last  Bell’ (gifts to orphanage school 
leavers);
• Donor Day is held simultaneously at 
the Corporate Centre and at subsidiary 
and associate companies in association 
with the corporate donor program of 
the Federal Medico-Biological Agency 
of Russia. Money which is collected is 
transferred to the Gift of Life Fund. TARGETED AID
Funds were provided in 2011 as part of 
the Company’s targeted aid program 
for construction of a sports ground in 
the town of Muravlenko and construc -
tion of a football pitch with an artificial 
surface in the town of Noyabrsk. Pre-
school institutions in Tomsk Region, 
the NGO Yamalo -Nenets Autonomous 
District Innovation Development Fund, 
and the Peter and Paul Fortress Culture 
and Educational Programs Fund also re -
ceived assistance.
Employees at Gazprom Neft’s 
Corporate Centre have established 
a volunteer group for cooperation 
with orphanages and rehabilitation 
centres. In May 2011 a charity action 
was carried out to help children 
at the Dolzhansky and Rzhevsky 
social and rehabilitation centres for 
children, located in Orel and Tver 
regions, respectively. The centres are 
located far from Moscow and there -
fore tend to be neglected. Volunteers 
from Gazprom Neft got to know 
the children, presented them with 
gifts and gained an understanding of 
the children’s needs and the needs 
of their teachers. Money and other 
items needed by children were then 
collected. More than 100 people 
from the Corporate Centre took part 
in the action. A playground was built 
for children at the Rzhevsky Centre, 
and the premises at the Dolzhansky 
rehabilitation centre were repaired. 
Toys, summer sports equipment, 
clothes, household goods, needle -
work sets, roller-skates, medicines 
and stationery were bought for 
children. < previous

Department, was singled out as one of 
the best Russian managers in a rating by 
the Russian Managers Association and 
Kommersant Publishing House.PUBLIC RECOGNITION
Public recognition of Gazprom Neft’s 
social programs is a tribute to their 
success. In 2011, the Company 
received dozens of letters of 
gratitude from regional and local 
administrations, and from public 
organisations.

The final draft text of this Report was, 
at the Company’s request, reviewed by 
a group of leading independent experts 
in sustainable development, including: 
Dr. Teodorina Lessidrenska, GRI 
Associate and the GRI’s Ambassador 
for Russia, CIS and CEE; Elena 
Feoktistova, Director of the Centre 
for Corporate Social Responsibility 
and Non-Financial Reporting at 
the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs; and Veronika Kabalina, 
Professor and Head of the Department 
of Human Resources Management 
at the Faculty of Management of 
the National Research University 
Higher School of Economics. These 
expert opinions are published below. In comparison with the 2010 report, 
the presentation of the company’s organiza -
tional profile is improved in terms of its clarity 
and detail. The overview of the company’s op -
erational and financial results and its economic 
performance for 2011 is clear and extensive. 
Projections for 2012 set a forward-looking 
tone that is also present in all other sections of 
the report, and this is an important character -
istic seen in the best sustainable development 
reports. The comprehensive description of 
the company’s business mission, strategy and 
goals includes the company’s principles of 
social and environmental responsibility as part 
of its business strategy.
The section on Sustainable Development 
Strategy is one of the best achievements of 
the 2011 Report. The outline of the company’s 
definition of sustainable development and so -
cial responsibility (the two pillars of its sustain -
ability strategy); the brief review of the com -
pany’s challenges, directions and priorities 
in the area of sustainable development; and 
the detailed presentation of the company’s 
sustainability goals for the period 2011–2013 
mark significant progress in development 
of the company’s sustainability strategy in 
comparison with the 2010 Report. 
Further in the same section, the chapter 
on Management in the Areas of Sustainable 
Development and Stakeholder Engagement 
presents a good review of the company’s 
corporate governance structure, including 
general information on members of the highest 
governance body responsible for the company’s 
sustainability aspects. The chapter gives a good 
general review of the integration of sustainable 
development issues, such as anticorruption 
and environmental and operational safety, into 
the company’s risk management. It highlights

TEODORINA PENTCHEVA LESSIDRENSKA,
Independent Expert, GRI Associate  
and the GRI’s Ambassador for Russia,  
NIS and CEE34 
The present statement and recommenda -
tions are based on my review of the Russian 
version of the JSC Gazprom Neft Sustainable 
Development Report 2011 (‘the Report’). I 
used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3-1 
Guidelines as a basis for evaluating the informa -
tion presented in the Report. During my review 
of the Report, I also applied my knowledge of 
ISO 26000, and where appropriate I took into 
account the AA1000APS (2008) principles of 
inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness. The 
observations and recommendations in this 
statement represent my personal independent 
opinion. I was not involved in the preparation of 
any part of the Report. Prior to this assignment, 
I reviewed the 2010 Report and submitted 
recommendations for improvement in an unof -
ficial capacity. 
The Report is based on the GRI Guidelines 
(version G3-1). The company has declared that 
the Report applies Level B of this standard, 
which implies expanded disclosure including 
both standard performance indicators and 
governance. In the process of preparation of 
the Report, the company has implemented 
an internal self-assessment of its activities in 
the sphere of sustainability and social respon -
sibility based on ISO 26000:2010
Observations and conclusions
The Report gives a detailed and thorough 
presentation of the business results of 
Gazprom Neft and its subsidiaries and as -
sociates in 2011, including financial indica -
tors and ESG performance.

made toward development of a company-wide 
comprehensive approach in management of 
all material aspects and issues of sustainability 
performance. 
There is also a very good overview of 
the company’s different types of stakehold -
ers, and of the relevance to each of them of 
principles and areas of engagement – the pre -
sentation is extensive and generally satisfies 
the GRI principle for stakeholder inclusive -
ness. Stakeholder engagement mechanisms 
are also described well and in detail.
At the end of the first section, the newly 
introduced chapter on Corporate Culture 
brings valuable additional details about the cur -
rent system of corporate values, the results 
achieved in the process of its improvement, 
and its importance for development and imple -
mentation of the sustainability strategy. 
The company’s sustainability performance 
is presented in three sections of the Report: 
Development of Workforce Potential; Secure 
Development: Health, Safety and Environment; 
and Regional Policy and Community 
Development. These sections include extensive 
information on a wide range of sustainability is -
sues in the environmental, social and economic 
areas of company performance. Quantitative 
data for the 2011 reporting period is presented 
in comparison with relevant data from previous 
reporting periods, and in most places is backed 
up with good analysis. Cases are used to bring 
depth to the analysis of important issues and to 
give a perspective on developments and prog -
ress made with respect to certain sustainability 
issues by various business units of the company. 
Each section provides extensive description of 
governance and systems relevant to the sustain -
ability aspects addressed in the section. 
Recommendations
Based on the level of sustainability report -
ing reflected in Gazprom Neft Sustainable 
Development Report 2011 and the level of its integration with the annual financial reporting 
cycle, it appears that Gazprom Neft is ready 
to make the next step forward in line with 
the latest trends toward a more integrated and 
analytical approach in presentation of financial, 
environmental, social and governance aspects 
of the company’s performance and impacts. 
Therefore, it is recommended that in the next 
reporting cycle Gazprom Neft considers 
development of an Integrated Report in line 
with the recommendations of the International 
Integrated Reporting Committee (IIRC) and 
current best practices in integrated reporting 
worldwide.
An Integrated Report requires further 
work on deepening the alignment and 
linkages between the company’s busi -
ness strategy and sustainability strategy, 
with the goal of presenting them as one 
integrated strategy. The integrated report -
ing model would also present an effec -
tive platform for further improvement in 
the recommended areas below: 
• In the 2012 Report the broader sustain -
ability context should be addressed. 
The next report should expand on how key 
sustainability challenges and opportuni -
ties determine sustainability goals and 
targets for innovation, finding technologi -
cal solutions, and main business objectives. 
The 2012 Report should include a more 
elaborate description of risks and oppor -
tunities arising from wider sustainability 
trends, and prioritize them in accordance 
with their relevance for the company’s 
strategy, competitiveness, financial perfor -
mance and core business risks, opportuni -
ties, and targets. Challenges and negative 
developments should be presented and 
discussed more openly. An integrated 
approach will also provide a stronger base 
for detailed analysis and description of 
the process used in selection of issues to be 
addressed in the Report.• An integrated approach will also help to 
build a comprehensive set of measurable 
targets linked to development direc -
tions and priorities in each key area of 
the sustainable development strategy. 
The 2011 Report contains description of 
planned activities and tasks for 2012 at 
the end of each performance section, but 
measurable indicators do not cover all 
the areas of sustainability strategy. 
• The reporting on environmental perfor -
mance will benefit from further expansion of 
the scope and depth of coverage of the GRI 
environmental indicators, to include, for 
example, climate change initiatives. There is 
also a need for specific quantitative targets in 
minimization of negative impacts and risks.
• It is recommended that the company 
should consider participation and reporting 
in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). 
The company should develop and report 
on its processes and controls to measure, 
monitor and report carbon emissions. 
Environmental effects and impacts of 
offshore and onshore oil and gas activ -
ity need to be presented in more detail in 
the Gazprom Neft 2012 report. 
• The 2011 Report is written in a manner that 
is understandable and accessible to a wide 
circle of stakeholders. It will be available in 
two languages - Russian and English. A glos -
sary of technical terms is provided. However, 
further work needs to be done on better dis -
tribution of the volume of reported informa -
tion between different formats and channels, 
including maximum use of the Internet. Such 
distribution is a prerequisite for integrated 
reporting.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011contents
While noting the merits of the Report, 
I recommend attention to some issues 
which offer scope for  further improvement 
in the quality of the reported information: 
• it would be useful to accompany the infor -
mation on sustainable develop  ment goals, 
which is clearly set out in the Report, with 
details of specific plans to achieve those 
goals in the next reporting period and to 
present relevant indicators for evaluating 
the expected results; 
• information on the results attained would 
be better perceived if they were compared 
with the target parameters, since this would 
enable a more complete evaluation of 
the progress made and of issues, and draw 
attention to areas of rapid growth; 
• there should be more analysis of problem 
areas;
• stakeholder engagement aspects 
would be better presented if they were 
complemented with more specific 
examples and results of the engagement.
The practice of independent 
confirmation of the Report should also 
be consistently followed and further 
developed, including a public certification 
procedure, which will contribute to 
further development and enhancement 
of the reporting process at the Company, 
and which is in conformity with best 
practice in this area.
March 26, 2012The innovative approach used in 
preparing the Report is worth special 
notice: the Company analysed its 
responsible business practices on the basis 
of the provisions of ISO 26000:2010 and 
recommendations of the Russian Union 
of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs for 
self-assessment of a company’s activities 
in accordance with the social responsibility 
principles based on this standard. 
Gazprom Neft was among the first 
Russian companies to conduct an internal 
self-assessment in a number of important 
aspects of its business organisation in 
accordance with the requirements set 
out in ISO 26000:2010, and the Company 
draws attention to this in the 2011 Report. 
An essential step was thus made in 
the development of sustainability 
management and in improving the culture 
of corporate non-financial reporting. 
The Company demonstrates understanding 
and recognition of social responsibility and 
sustainable development principles that 
have been assumed at international level, 
offering the stakeholders clear coordinates 
for evaluating its activities and a platform for 
dialogue. 
It appears that the Company will further 
expand the scope of its self-assessment 
in conformity with the provisions of 
ISO 26000:2010 and move consistently 
towards integrating social responsibility 
principles into its business processes, 
including all governance levels and areas of 
responsibility. ELENA FEOKTISTOVA
Director of the Centre for Corporate 
Social Responsibility and Non-Financial 
Reporting of the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs
The JSC Gazprom Neft 2011 Sustainable 
Development Report has been prepared 
to a good level of quality, displaying 
consistency and progress in development of 
the reporting process at the Company.
The Report shows that sustainable 
development and corporate social 
responsibility issues are considered by 
the Company as matters of strategic 
importance. The information provided 
reflects the Company’s position regarding 
the stated priorities and goals of sustainable 
development, covers governance in 
this sphere, as well as strategy and main 
results achieved in the reporting period in 
key business areas, including economic, 
environmental and social components. 
Expanded coverage is given to approaches 
to stakeholder engagement.
The information provided offers 
continuity with the previous Report. 
The data in the Company’s Sustainable 
Development Report and the Annual 
Report, which are synchronised in terms 
of preparation, complement each other, 
providing the stakeholders with a more 
complete and comprehensive insight into 
the Company’s business and its impacts it 
makes on the external community.< previous

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011contents
has shared its approaches to conducting an in -
ternal self-assessment based on this standard. 
What directions should be pursued in 
the future? This question is partially answered 
by the Company itself, which has supplemented 
each section of the Report with an outlook 
for 2012. It should also be noted that the 2011 
Report discloses Company plans regarding 
the development of non-financial information, in 
which the Company relies both on previous ex -
perience and international trends established in 
recent years. And the Company has demonstrat -
ed its commitment to best practices by declaring 
its intent to move to preparation and publication 
of an integrated corporate report in the future.
I see two opportunities for development 
of the Company’s non-financial reporting in 
the near future. The 2011 Report gives a much 
bigger insight then the previous report into 
stakeholder engagement. However, it would 
be desirable to see more detailed coverage of 
the process of information exchange with inter -
nal stakeholders and its outcome. Such exam -
ples are present in the Report, but they appear 
to require expansion. This would raise the issue 
of stakeholder engagement to a higher quality 
level and enable a clearer presentation of 
the role of stakeholder engagement mecha -
nisms in implementing development strategy, 
including new mechanisms for integrating 
stakeholder interests into the management 
decision-making process.
The Report gives much attention to 
issues of work with personnel. However, 
the Report might benefit from incorporating 
the live voices of employees, and opinions 
and wishes of real people.
March 26, 2012the Company applies an integrated approach 
to building its management system, incorpo -
rating mechanisms that respond to the most 
urgent social issues. It is reported that 
Gazprom Neft is implementing an Integrated 
Risk Management System (IRMS) and devel -
oping a program to control corruption risks.
A response to relevant social demands can 
be found in the section of the Report covering re -
gional policy and local community development, 
where new forms of organisation of charitable 
activities are highlighted. The Report incor -
porates information on topical environmental 
issues and discloses the experience of individual 
companies within Gazprom Neft. The principal 
provisions of the corporate health, safety and 
environment policy and the Company’s com -
mitments in these areas are presented in more 
detail as compared with the previous report. 
On the whole, the information in 
the 2011 Report is rendered in a more struc -
tured and specific manner and the reporting 
scope on a number of indicators has been 
expanded. Sustainability reporting prac -
tices have also been extended to foreign 
subsidiaries of the Company: a Gazprom Neft 
entity, NIS, was the first company in Serbia to 
prepare a sustainable development report in 
conformity with international standards.
For the first time, the Company engaged 
independent experts to review and render 
a public evaluation of the Company’s Report. 
The Company continues its efforts to improve 
the quality of reporting prepared according to 
GRI Guidelines. When preparing the Report, 
the latest version of this standard, G3.1, was 
used. The Report also employed a number 
of indicators from the GRI Oil and Gas Sector 
Supplement. The Company was among the first 
Russian companies to start using the new 
international social responsibility standard, 
ISO 26000:2010, and in the Report the Company VERONIKA KABALINA

Resources Management,

When a company issues a non-financial report 
which is not the first one — the Report in ques -
tion by Gazprom Neft (‘the Report’) is already 
the sixth Sustainable Development Report by 
this company – a concerned reader will have 
a question: what new things has the Company 
done in the past year and has information 
about these things become more interesting 
and comprehensible in the Report? 
Answering this question, we should note 
that the 2011 Report both extends the range 
of information provided and offers new 
approaches to information presentation, 
reflecting development of the Company’s 
sustainability practices. 
The Report contains information not only 
on successful operating and financial results 
in the reporting year, but on establishment 
of conditions for sustainable development, 
which include capital investment in upgrade 
of production facilities, investment in foreign 
projects and projects to develop new assets. 
As compared to the previous Report, broader 
coverage is provided on matters of sustainabil -
ity management, and more attention is given 
to the role of the Board of Directors. Changes 
in the management system are also reflected, 
including organisational changes which testify 
to the flexible response of the Company to 
evolving business conditions.

in the Report, one can conclude that < previous
