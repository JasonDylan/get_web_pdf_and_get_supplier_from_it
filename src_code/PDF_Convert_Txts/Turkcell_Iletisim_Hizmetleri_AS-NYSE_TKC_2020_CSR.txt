TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 APPENDICESChairman’s message
Bülent Aksu
Chairman of the Board of Directors
Please see page 33 for detailed CV.
2020 was a year, in which we wit -
nessed a global health crisis that led to 
unpr
ecedented economic, social and 
environmental developments in the re -
cent world history. As of March 2020, the C
OVID-19 pandemic started to af -
fect our country as well. The pandem -
ic led to various social and economic cha
llenges that impacted individuals, 
businesses and overall society for the whole year. Our government has de -
veloped policies since the first day of the p
andemic to mitigate its impacts 
on our citizens. As Turkcell, we have also taken several measures to mini -
mize the effects of the pandemic con -
sidering the health of our customers, b
usiness partners and employees.
As the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to reconsider our knowledge and habits, it also highlighted the key role of communications in our lives. Accord -
ingly, we concluded the year having s
trengthened and renewed our servic -
es and products so as to better fight aga
inst the negative impacts of this 
recently-emerged phenomena.
We successfully met the rising demand 
for digital services and telecommuni -
cations offerings during the pandemic via o
ur robust infrastructure. We con -
tinued to offer the best experience to o
ur people through our telecom servic -
es, the key to our consistent growth, as w
ell as our digital products portfolio, 
our digital business services that pro -
vide organizations with an end-to-end d
igital transformation opportunity, and 
our new generation payment systems in techfin.
Our most important tool to drive value 
creation in this challenging environ -ment was our robust telecommunica -
tions infrastructure, in which we have 
in
vested TRY32 billion over the past 
five years. In a period, when telecom operators around the world requested internet broadcasters to restrict service or lower video resolution as a solution to the intensive use of the network, we successfully managed a traffic increase, approaching  50%, with our robust infrastructure. We continued our 5G preparations at full speed concen -
trating on network transition and R&D ac
tivities. Additionally, we carried out 
valuable activities together with our business partners towards developing domestic and national 5G products and digital solutions.
We enabled our customers to meet 
all their communication needs with -
out leaving their homes through our w
ebsite and Digital Operator appli -
cation, the infrastructure of which we op
timized recently. We increased the 
upload speed fourfold to 20 Mbps and the minimum download speed up to 50 Mbps, to improve the experience of our fiber internet subscribers for re -
mote working and distance learning. Due 
to strong customer interest in high -
er speeds, in September we launched o
ur 200 Mbps household internet offer.
We provided solutions for those, who needed communication the most, such as healthcare workers, our custom -
ers aged 65 and above, and children c
ontinuing distant education, through 
support packages. We helped efforts to raise awareness of the pandemic communicating #lifesathome caption to our customers. We made the time they were obliged to spend at home more enjoyable by providing addition -
al benefits on our services such as BiP, Der
gilik, fizy and TV+. As the payment 
methods of people started to digitize, our new generation payment platform Paycell stood out with its easy-to-use and secure payment infrastructure. The digital content purchases over Paycell doubled compared to last year reflect -
ing the change in payment habits.
V
ideo conference systems have be -
come widely used tools in the new 
w
orking models led by the pandemic. 
However, the security and data privacy issues associated with various systems have raised concerns among  individ -
ual users and corporations. In order to addr
ess these issues, we rapidly took 
the necessary steps to offer our cus -
tomers a secure alternative. Accord -
ingly, thanks to the efforts of Turkcell eng
ineers , we launched our advanced 
digital conference solution, BiP Meet, and took the remote meeting experi -
ence to the next level.
T
he developments regarding data pri -
vacy and protection in the early days 
o
f 2021 once again underlined the 
critical importance of developing and using domestic and national applica -
tions. Our communication and life plat -
form BiP, which has been developed b
y Turkish engineers and reflects our 
commitment to the issue, attracted the interest of users with the rising aware -
ness of the society on data privacy. BiP s
tarted to be used in many countries 
thanks to the features including instant translation and video calls of up to 10 people, differentiating it from competi -
tion in the international arena. I believe that as a c
ountry, we should be using About Turkcell28 29ABOUT TURKCELL VALUE CREATING TURKCELL STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL CAPITAL HUMAN CAPITAL MANUFACTURED CAPITAL INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL NATURAL CAPITAL OUR SOCIAL VALUES AND RELATIONS

saging, but in all other fields. We will 
ine
vitably encounter with similar nega -
tive experiences in the future unless we r
ely on our own digital solutions.
We implemented a TRY47 million sup -
port package  to keep our ecosystem f
unctioning and preserve employment 
as part of the fight against pandem -
ic. We also stood beside our people in ne
ed, having made a TRY20 million do -
nation to the “Together We Are Enough My T
urkey” campaign launched by our 
President Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
We continued to carry out activities in 
the health sector leveraging our quar -
ter-century experience in communi -
cations and technology also in 2020, when he
alth issues became even more 
important. In this period, in which Tur-
key has marked worldwide best prac-
tices in the health sector, four hospi -
tals, two of which were field hospitals, 
w
ere opened. We continued to provide 
service through the Turkcell Hospital Information Management System at Yozgat, Adana, Elâzığ, Eskişehir, Bur -
sa, Başakşehir Çam and Sakura, and T
ekirdağ City Hospitals. All of these 
facilities, equipped with Turkcell tech-
nologies, are focused on providing the 
b
est healthcare service to our people.
As the leader in supporting the digital transformation of our country, we con -
tinued to offer our corporate custom -
ers wide range of solutions including ho
sting services, cloud infrastructure, 
backup services, disaster recovery and security services. In this respect, we reached a total white space  area of 39,500 m
2 with our data centers 
established in four cities and at eight locations. While our traditional data centers are located in Dudullu, Kar -
tal, Yenibosna and Söğütözü, our new gener
ation data centers, that are 
equipped with superior technologies and built to international standards, are located in Ankara Temelli and Euro -
pean side, Gebze, and İzmir. Our ability t
o manage over 11,000 virtual servers  
and over 20 petabytes of data for our corporate customers underpins their 
trust in the Turkcell brand. In this con -
text, we continued our activities around dat
a centers keeping our pace in 2020. 
Our data centers, in which we have invested over TRY2 billion to date, en -
able us to provide services addressing the ne
eds of the region, backup data 
across different geographies, and en -
sure the security of customer data.
W
e deem compliance with the law on 
the protection of personal data as part 
of all our products and services among our top priorities. In this respect, we took advanced measures with respect to data privacy and security to ensure compliance with the regulations of our country, as well as with the Gener -
al Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which w
e are subject to regarding 
our products and services provided in European Union countries. While our Compliance Committee  carries out its activities to audit processes, pro -
cedures and policies with respect to dat
a security, we aim to improve our 
risk management and accountability having established Data Impact Anal -
ysis process. Within the scope of GDPR c
ompliance, we appointed a Data Pro -
tection Officer (DPO) to the Turkcell Gr
oup. We will continue to implement 
all necessary actions to comply with national and international legislation, as well as GDPR in the upcoming pe -
riods.
In
tellectual capital is undoubtedly a 
subject of equal importance to finan -
cial capital in strengthening a compa -
ny. As part of this vision, we conducted 
s
everal valuable projects in 2020 in 
accordance with diversity and inclu -
siveness principles that shapes Turk-
cell’s human resources practices. In 
p
articular, we give utmost importance 
to increasing the number of wom -
en employees to enhance equality of opp
ortunity within our sector. In this 
respect, we launched our “Women En -
gineer Employment” project targeting w
omen engineers, who are to begin 
their career or whose career was in -terrupted for various reasons. As part 
o
f our recruitment activities to help 
reverse brain drain, which is another key consideration for us from a hu -
man resources perspective, we kicked o
ff the “Stars Coming Back” project in 
2020, thus opening Turkcell’s doors to Turkish professionals working abroad. While we have created over 1,000 employment through the “GNÇYTNK” program over the past 6 years, we also implemented a new project in 2020 for young people. Accordingly, we gave 10,010 university students and recent graduates the opportunity to gain ex -
perience at Turkcell’s departments of their
 choice via our “Unlimited Talent 
Program”. As part of this mega pro -
ject, which we enabled online remote ac
cess as the pioneer of digital trans -
formation, our young people had the opp
ortunity to engage in countless job 
experiences from technology trainings to personal development workshops, networking and mentor support to meeting with senior management and award competitions. In order to create stronger synergy, our artificial intelli -
gence systems grouped young people ac
cording to their specific areas of 
interest, whereby the participants had the opportunity to fully utilize Turkey’s most extensive experience project.
Although 2020 was a year that chal -
lenged organizations in terms of mac -
roeconomic and governance perspec -
tives, Turkcell became even stronger 
wi
th the developments realized in 
the last quarter of the year. The his -
torical decisions taken at our Gener -
al Assembly held in October with the s
trong participation of our sharehold -
ers marked the start of a new era for o
ur Company. At the General Assem -
bly of Turkcell, which represents Turkey in the in
ternational capital markets, 
amendments to its articles of asso -
ciation were approved by the share -
holders. Turkey Wealth Fund became the lar
gest and controlling  shareholder 
with a 26.2% stake following the com -pletion of share transfer transactions 
sub
sequent to the General Assembly. I 
wholeheartedly believe that our Com -
pany will continue its consistent growth and b
ecome more competitive at the 
global level with the simplified share -

Turkcell, which is a significant value for our country, is listed both at Borsa Istanbul and the New York Stock Ex -
change for 20 years. It is our intention t
o enhance the value created over 
those 20 years to a higher level in the upcoming periods, with the trust of our domestic and foreign investors.

ny in Turkey responding to the call of the Uni
ted Nations in September 2020, 
which celebrated its 75th anniversa-

lobal crisis caused by the pandemic, 
we signed the declaration that requires demonstrating transparent and ethical leadership as the public sector, civil society and private sector, prioritizing value-oriented strategies and acting in cooperation with stakeholders to elim -
inate inequalities.
A

priorities is to reach out and improve 
lives through the power of technology and communications, while providing our customers the highest quality ser -
vice. We stood by our people in 2020 as w
e have done for the past 27 years, 
with our social responsibility projects focused on social benefits and re -
duction of inequality. We touched the l
ives of 200 thousand young and 
disabled individuals with our Whiz Kids and People Without Boundaries projects that we have invested in for many years in the education area. Our We also stood 
beside our people 
in need, having 
made a TRY20 
million donation to 
the “Together We 
Are Enough My

launched by our 
President Mr. Recep 
Tayyip Erdoğan.I wholeheartedly 
believe that 
our Company 
will continue its 
consistent growth 
and become 
more competitive 
at the global 
level with the 
simplified 
shareholder 
structure and 
thereby enhanced 
decision-making

TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020APPENDICESDream Companion, My Sign Language 
and My Gem Inside projects are the best examples of how inequalities can be reduced utilizing the power of tech -
nology. Following the earthquake, /f.altlood and avalanche disasters we faced, we mobilized our technology and commu -
nications power for our people in the /f.altield. We marked a /f.altirst in the world with our Helping Hand project, which we rapidly implemented over Payce -
ll platform after the /f.altlood disaster in Giresun. We reached out to  tradesmen  and families impacted by the /f.altlood, and provided our support via Paycell. In addition to the support provided by our Company, “Turkcell Volunteers”, whose entire income is generated via the do -
nations of Turkcell Group employees, helped our people via the campaigns initiated for Elâzığ, Giresun and İzmir. We will continue to be at service of Turkey, both with our technological power and our social bene/f.altit projects, as we have been for 27 years.
While developing globally competi -

importance to these technologies be -
ing people-oriented. In this respect, we established “the Arti/f.alticial Intelli-gence Principles”, in a /f.altirst for Turkey. We shared our commitment to these principles with the public via the arti -
/f.alticial technologies we have developed. Furthermore, we adapted a sustaina -
ble technology development approach that is ethical, responsible and respect -
ful of human rights. Duly, our Human Rights Policy states that we undertake the mission of carefully observing the governance processes of Arti/f.alticial In -
telligence Principles. 
As part of our sustainability activities, 
one of our key focus areas, we took important steps in 2020, and realizing many /f.altirsts. We are truly proud of es -
tablishing our Integrated Value Crea -

newable energy investments towards becoming a carbon-neutral company, the Green Loan we obtained to /f.altinance those investments, as well as issuance of human rights and environmental policies were other important develop -
ments of this year. And so I am pleased to present you with our integrated an -
nual report, one of the most valuable outputs of these activities, and which we prepared for the /f.altirst time this year so as to enable all our stakeholders, especially our investors, to get to know Turkcell better, and evaluate it from a wider perspective.
I would like to extend my sincere grat -

TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 APPENDICESMessage from the CEO 
Murat Erkan
Chief Executive Officer
Please see page 45 for detailed CV.
2020 was a year, in which COVID-19 pandemic led to drastic changes in economic and social terms worldwide, and transformed daily life and ways of doing business. And as we met brand-new concepts such as social distanc -
ing, remote working and distance e
ducation, we also witnessed a rapid 
digital transformation in our lives. In fact, all of these developments have further underlined the importance of investments in communication infra -
structures and technology. Today, it is widely ac
cepted that having a strong 
telecommunication sector is the only way to ensure the successful trans -
formation of education, the business w
orld and the wider economy in this 
new environment.
As the Turkcell family, we mobilized 
our technology infrastructure, know-how and experience so as to provide our customers a high quality and unin -
terrupted communication experience thr
oughout 2020 operating period, 
which was shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic. We benefitted from the advantages of our leader position in the sector in terms of digitalization, and of investments in our infrastructure over the years. Leveraging our strong mobile and fixed infrastructures, we successfully managed the increased traffic on our network, while meeting the changing demands of our custom-ers without any difficulty. Indeed, our d
igital services, digital business ser-
vices and techfin services successful -
ly met the rapidly rising digitalization ne
eds of our both consumer and cor-
porate segment customers.W
e took several measures for our 
employees and customers within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented the remote work -
ing model prioritizing the health of o
ur employees since the first COV -
ID-19 case was detected thanks to o
ur communication systems and in-
formation technology infrastructure. Our
 remote working model also in-
cludes over 10 thousand call center emplo
yees. While the pandemic led 
to increased data and digital services usage, we have successfully managed the resulting network traffic increase through our strong telecommunication infrastructure and  our timely invest-ments. During this period, we offered supp
ort packages for customers aged 
65 and above, healthcare workers and students, and thereby stood by them. We improved the connection quali -
ty of our fiber subscribers, who work f
rom home, or who continue their ed -
ucation remotely. In line with the in-crease in time spent at home, interest in o
ur digital services also increased 
accordingly. We provided additional benefits in various services we pro -
vide through our rich portfolio of dig -
ital services. In cooperation with the Minis
try of Health, we created a BiP 
channel where up to date COVID-19 information, measures and content are shared. Turkcell customers aged 65 and over, who stayed at home, could make a call to Paycell’s call center and order basic food and cleaning agents and pay through their bills. As part of our social responsibility projects, we provided new 3D printers to the Whiz Kids Laboratories opened with our support, and children could produce face shields for healthcare workers.
As customer behavior changed sig -
nificantly over the pandemic period, 
onl
ine platforms saw increased us-
age for shopping. We also observed s
trong rise in transaction volumes on 
our website and Digital Operator ap -
plication, which are among our focus ar
eas and that we regularly develop. 
While the number of visitors to digi -
tal sales channels reached 30 million p
er month in 2020, the 3-month ac-
tive users of Digital Operator appli -
cation was 23 million. Online top-up tr
ansaction volume realized over these 
channels tripled on an annual basis. In this context, the share of digital sales channels in Turkcell Turkey consumer revenues (excluding our fixed busi -
ness) reached 14.3% in fourth quarter o
f 2020.  Going forward, we will con -
tinue to focus on sales through digital channels
, which positively impacts our 
operational costs. Another important development of 2020 was the launch of our technological marketplace, Turkcell Pasaj. Our customers can pur -
chase thousands of products including smar
tphones, new generation tech -
nologies, household electrical appli -
ances, personal care products, gaming c
omputers, sports products, music and 
hobby products from Turkey’s leading suppliers with Turkcell assurance over Turkcell Pasaj, which was developed by Turkcell engineers.About Turkcell40 41ABOUT TURKCELL VALUE CREATING TURKCELL STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL CAPITAL HUMAN CAPITAL MANUFACTURED CAPITAL INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL NATURAL CAPITAL OUR SOCIAL VALUES AND RELATIONS
TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 APPENDICESOur digital-oriented strategy
and strong business model led to robust resultsIn 2020, all macroeconomic develop -
ments were affected by the conse -
quences of COVID-19 pandemic. The e
conomic activity in many sectors 
came to a halt with the distortions in the global supply chain and demand, and also with increased unemploy -
ment. These developments eventually le
d global economies to contract in 
2020. Yet despite these conditions that affected Turkey and our other coun-tries of operation, we sustained our suc
cessful operational and financial 
performance in 2020, thanks to our digital-oriented strategy and robust business model. Turkcell’s consolidat -
ed revenues rose by 15.8% to TRY29.1 bi
llion. Consolidated EBITDA increased 
by 17.7% to TRY12.3 billion leading to an EBITDA margin 42.2% on 0.7pp im -
provement. Our EBIT margin was 21.6%. W
e registered a strong net income 
performance of TRY4.2 billion on 30.5% rise. Our operational capex to sales ra -
tio (excluding licenses) was realized at 18.5% in l
ine with our plans. Moreover, 
along with these solid set of results, on the back of our strong balance sheet, cash generation strength and profita -
ble operations, we distributed TRY812 mi
llion in dividends to our sharehold-
ers, which corresponds to the highest r
ate permitted by legislation.
Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we strengthened our subscriber baseIn a period, when the effects of the pandemic were deeply felt, we stood by our customers with our wide range of offers, additional benefits and cam -
paigns that addressed the changing cus
tomer needs through an innovative 
and value creation focused approach. In particular, we responded to the ris -
ing data usage demand via products and s
ervices offered over our mobile 
and fixed networks. Consequently, as our customers appreciated our value propositions, our subscriber base ex -
panded with net additions of 1.1 million in 2020.
 Accordingly, despite the chal -
lenges of the pandemic, we achieved o
ur target of adding 1 million subscrib-
ers in 2020.
W
hile our postpaid subscriber base 
expanded strongly with 1.6 net annu -
al additions, the share of our postpaid 
sub
scribers in total mobile subscribers 
reached 66%. Mobile blended ARPU (excluding M2M) rose 15.0% reach -
ing TRY49.1 driven mainly by growing p
ostpaid subscriber base, rising data 
and digital service usage and upsell efforts.
Demand for our fixed offers was also 
strong in 2020, as our customers spent more time at home. While we regis -
tered net 180 thousand fiber subscrib -
er additions, our total fixed subscriber b
ase exceeded 2.4 million. Residential 
fiber ARPU rose by 9.2% to TRY70.9. Superbox, our product offering unin -
terrupted household internet service at fi
ber speeds over the mobile net -
work, became one of our most suc -
cessful products of 2020 amid rapidly gr
owing demand for fixed broadband. 
In 2020, where the importance of fast and high-quality household internet service became ever clearer, Super-box reached 591 thousand total sub -
scribers with 268 thousand net sub -
scriber additions, successfully meeting s
trong customer demand. Our IPTV 
subscriber base also rose to 871 thou -
sand subscribers with 152 thousand ne
t additions  this year.
We met the rising digital needs of our customers via our three strategic focus areasIn 2020, we continued to serve our customers with our innovative and inclusive digital services developed by Turkish engineers. Our standalone digital services revenue rose 26% for the year. In a period of increased time spent at home, we stood by our cus -
tomers with our digital service portfo-lio. We made their time at home more enjo
yable by offering digital experi-
ence over TV+, fizy, lifebox and Dergi-lik platforms, while enabling them to ma
ke video calls with their loved ones 
via BiP. We continued to develop our digital portfolio by adding various new features and services this year as well. We also established separate compa -
nies for BiP, TV+, fizy and lifebox servic -
es marking a significant milestone for their
 competition strategies. Through 
our product, TV+ Ready, we offered the opportunity to turn every television into a smart TV thanks to the embed -
ded TV+ application. We introduced the T
urkcell Digital Security service to 
address continuously rising internet usage so as to ensure the security of our consumer segment customers. We also added the lifebox transfer service to our portfolio, allowing users to eas -
ily and securely share files. We began t
o offer YaaniMail e-mail service to our 
corporate customers this year, provid -
ing uninterrupted service over our data c
enters. Meanwhile, as remote work -
ing practices led to increased demand f
or video conferencing, we developed 
the BiP Meet application to meet this need, and offered it to our customers. We felt proud as 12
th Ambassadors 
Summit was held digitally over BiP Meet, developed by Turkish engineers. Moreover, we established a private closed platform for ASELSAN over BiP, ensuring that the intra-company cor -
respondence of around 8 thousand emplo
yees is conducted securely. Re -
cently rising concerns over data priva -
cy resulted in greater demand for the BiP appl
ication, where all user data is 
stored at high security data centers of Turkcell located in Turkey. In the first two months of 2021, BiP registered 27 million new users. We continued to ex -
port the digital services we developed in 2020.
 As part of our collaboration 
with Digicel, our BiP, TV+, lifebox and Fast Login services are currently being used in 32 countries, including the Car -ibbean, Central America and Pacific r
egions.
The revenue of digital business servic -
es, one of our strategic focus areas, and wi
th which we accompany pri-
vate companies and public institutions on 
their digital transformation journeys 
increased by 30% in 2020. We suc -
cessfully met the increased demand f
or new generation technologies such 
as data center, cloud, cyber security, managed services, system integration projects, internet of things, large data and business applications, in addition to the conventional telecom services in our portfolio. We took the lead in corporate digital transformations by being awarded over 2,300 projects with a total contract value of TRY1 billion in 2020. Of these, 420 were system integration projects for which we provided end-to-end solutions. We have a backlog in the amount of TRY967 million from the system inte -
gration projects signed to date. As the lar
gest data center operator of Turkey, 
we offered our more than 1,600 cor -
porate customers the opportunity to manage their
 data remotely, support -
ing their business continuity. We put in
to use the cloud section of Ankara 
Temelli Data Center, Turkey’s largest data center, launching “Government Cloud” specifically designed for public institutions. Meanwhile, having imple-mented the technological infrastruc-ture of 4 new hospitals in the health s
ector, two of which are field hospi-
tals, we reached a bed capacity of o
ver 8 thousand at 9 hospitals in total, 
also continuing our market leadership of this sector. Additionally, this year, we increased the number of glob -
al vendor partnerships to 21 through s
trengthened cooperation. By further 
increasing our competencies in this field over the coming period, we will remain the digital transformation part -
ner of corporations and become the le
ader in the information technologies 
market.In 2020, we

digital services 
revenue rose 26% 
for the year. In a 
period of increased 
time spent at home, 
we stood by our 
customers with 
our digital service 
portfolio. As the largest 
data center 
operator of 
Turkey, we offered 
our more than 
1,600 corporate 
customers the 
opportunity to 
manage their 
data remotely, 
supporting 
their business 
continuity. About Turkcell42 43ABOUT TURKCELL VALUE CREATING TURKCELL STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL CAPITAL HUMAN CAPITAL MANUFACTURED CAPITAL INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL NATURAL CAPITAL OUR SOCIAL VALUES AND RELATIONS
TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 APPENDICESOn the techfin front, our third strategic 
focus area, we helped our customers to complete all their payment transac -
tions swiftly and securely via our new gener
ation payment platform, Paycell, 
in the pandemic period, during which payment habits changed and the de -
mand for digital payment services r
ose. Our 3-month active subscribers 
using the Paycell application, differen -
tiated by its ease of use and secure p
ayment infrastructure, reached 4.7 
million. Thanks to the “Ready-to-use Limit” feature added to Paycell in July, users can spend their mobile payment limits over their Paycell cards. Ready-to-use-Limit reached 190 thousand in -
dividual users and a total volume of TR
Y85 million by the end of the year. 
The transaction volume on the Payce-ll card more than doubled compared t
o the same period of the previous 
year. Digital content purchases rose by 70% compared to the previous year to TRY84 million per month. In 2020, we took an important step to ensure that the 24/7 money transfer service to the IBAN numbers of contracted banks. We also added the mobile POS prod -
uct this year to the Paycell merchant s
olutions. Having been registered by 
the Ministry of Treasury and Finance and the Revenue Administration, Pay -
cell Android POS offers cost and ef-ficiency advantages to member mer -
chants, while providing the processes o
f collection, inventory monitoring 
and e-invoice over a single platform. Moreover, the total sapling donation to the Paycell Forest project, which we implemented as part of the Breath to the Future project of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, exceeded 11 thousand.
We continued to generate cash
Thanks to our strong operational per -
formance, disciplined cost manage -
ment practices, and effective working c
apital management and efficient 
capex planning, we generated TRY3.4 billion free cash flow from our opera -
tions in 2020. Thus, despite exchange r
ate fluctuations, our net debt to EBIT -
DA ratio improved by 0.2x and de -
clined to 0.8x by the end of the year. T
he foreign currency cash we hold and 
the derivatives instruments we use to mitigate foreign currency risk support -
ed our strong net income performance.
W
e continued to invest in projects 
that will drive the future
One of the major topics of the up -
coming period will be 5G technology. Having c
ommenced use in over 60 
countries, 5G technology will play an important role in the digital transfor -
mation of institutions and sectors with the 
novel services it has to offer. While 
participating in studies both locally and at the international level towards bringing the technology of the future to our customers, we work towards making our infrastructure ready for the 5G transition. Within this frame-
work, we take part in a diversity of 5G 
pr
ojects of international technological 
organizations such as those of NGMN, GSMA, and ITU. Additionally, this year, we also continued our support for the “End-to-End Domestic and National 5G Communication Network Project” established under the leadership of the Information and Communication Technologies Authority and with the support of TÜBİTAK, together with Communication Technologies Cluster firms. 
During the pandemic period, our cus -
tomers’ need for fast and high-quality 
W
i-Fi service increased. We signifi -
cantly improved indoor internet cov-erage through the Wi-Fi 6 technology that 
we implemented this year, and 
initially used in households in Turkey. Duly, we ensured internet usage of uniform quality throughout the home by preventing speed cuts caused by building structure.
The increased time spent at home, and 
the adaptation of remote working and While 
participating 
in studies both 
locally and at 
the international 
level towards 
bringing the 
technology of 
the future to our 
customers, we 
work towards 
making our 
infrastructure 
ready for the 5G 
transition.distance learning practices made the importance of access to fiber connec -
tions more apparent. Therefore, fiber ac
cess, which is essential to the digital 
transformation of our country and the transition to 5G technology, remains as a priority issue for our industry. As Turkcell, we believe in the need to rapidly implement a shared model in infrastructure investments so as to op -
timize use of our country’s resources. In this r
espect, we believe that instead of 
competing on infrastructure, we could invest our resources in services and projects, which could create greater value for our country.
We focused on our 
sustainability activitiesAs Turkcell, we attach priority to cre -
ating sustainable value, realizing social r
esponsibility projects and leveraging 
the power of technology and com -
munication to create social bene -
fit. The educational projects that we c
onduct leveraging our technological 
competencies with a commitment to equal opportunities, support achiev -
ing Sustainable Development Goals. In this r
espect, as part of People with-
out Boundaries project, we continue t
o offer diverse solutions to people 
with disabilities enabling them the opportunity to participate in daily life equally. We support the education of students with our Whiz Kids project that makes a difference with its rich content, while we raise awareness regarding electronic  waste via our Recycle into Education project. Going forward, we will continue to leverage technology to support our people in realizing their potential, to eliminate social barriers and to ensure social equality of opportunity. 
We view national and international 
non-governmental organizations as among the most valuable business partners in our ecosystem. In this re -
gard, while carrying out projects in c
ooperation with national and sec -toral NGOs, we feel the pride of rep-resenting Turkey on international plat -
forms. Accordingly, we are among the f
ounding members of the United 
Nations Global Compact CFO Task Force, an initiative that guides the fi -
nancial leaders of global companies in the field o
f sustainable finance. 
We contributed to the drafting of the Principles for Integrated Sustainable Development Goals Investments and Finance together with 42 internation -
al companies from diverse sectors. T
hese principles were announced to 
the world at the 75th session of the 
UN General Assembly meeting held in New York in September. Moreover, registering a first in the sector, we of -
fered our employees GSMA “Sustaina -
ble Business Development in the Mo -
bile Sector” online training.
W
e continued to utilize sustainability 
financing instruments this year as well. 
In this context, we signed a 5-year maturity EUR50 million green loan fi -
nancing agreement with ING Bank. T
his agreement marks the longest ma-
turity corporate green loan agreement thus f
ar signed in Turkey. We plan to 
utilize the credit for the financing of our sustainable investments.
The importance we attach to human 
resources has been one of the signifi -
cant values of Turkcell since its estab -
lishment. While making an investment in
to the intellectual capital and local 
development of our country via the “Stars Are Back” recruitment project, we offered 10,010 university students and new graduates the opportunity to gain experience at Turkcell and steer their future through the “Unlimited Tal-ent Program”.
A ne
w era began for Turkcell with 
simplification of its shareholding 
structureTurkey Wealth Fund became the larg -
est and controlling shareholder of our C
ompany with a 26.2% stake through the share transfer transactions com -
pleted in October. I consider this sig -
nificant development that led to a simpl
ified shareholding structure to be 
a milestone in Turkcell’s history. I also believe that our Company will contin-ue to deliver strong operational per -
formance, and sustainable and prof-itable growth in this new era entered in
to with Turkey Wealth Fund, which 
expressed its confidence in, and sup -
port for our strategy on all platforms.
And s
o in leaving 2020 behind, a year 
that emphasized communication and 
technology as being an indispensa -
ble human right, I wish to thank all o
ur employees for their contribution to 
our success, and our Board of Direc -
tors for their confidence and support. I w
ould like to express gratitude to our 
customers and business partners who have remained with us throughout our success story.
While celebrating the 20
th anniversary 
of being listed on both Borsa Istanbul 
and the New York Stock Exchange, we are to pioneer our sector adapting a new reporting structure. I am, there -
fore, delighted to present to you, our v
aluable stakeholders, the first Inte -
grated Report of Turkcell and of our s
ector. As Turkcell senior management, 
we have paid the utmost attention to implementing IIRC Framework require -
ments, in preparing our 2020 integrat -
ed annual report. Accordingly, we are pr
oud to present our first integrated 
report to you, our valuable stakehold-ers.  I firmly hope that 2021 becomes a y
ear in which we all look to the future 
in good health and confidence.
Sincerely,
Murat Erkan

Susta/i.loclTRKnab/i.loclTRKl/i.loclTRKty strategy
As part of our 2020 
integrated annual report, we designed Turkcell’s value creation process to tangibly measure the value-created and transparently communicate it to our stakeholders. Within the framework of value creation model, we present the main capitals of Turkcell via performance indicators that are enriched by its business operations and core competencies.Adaptation of Sustainability and its policies by all Turkcell employees, feature among the Company’s strategic goals, andare assigned as Key Performance Indicators for everyone from the Chief Executive Of/f.alticer to employees.
The six capital-based approach 
speci/f.altied in the IIRC Integrated Re-porting Framework has been adopt -
ed in establishing our value creation process. In the development of our value creation process, we organized integrated thinking focused meet -
ings and workshops with various departments of our Company to re -
/f.altlect their activities and capture their interactions with other divisions in light of Turkcell’s strategic focus ar -
eas, sustainability strategy and core competencies. We have identi/f.altied 
the global and local trends, risks and opportunities that have the potential to impact our value creation pro -
cess, and thus our business activities. 
As Turkcell, we conduct our activi -
ties not in isolation, but in connection 
with the stakeholders in our ecosys -
tem. In this respect, we have re/f.altlect -
ed the connection of our activities to our stakeholders, as well as to Sus-tainable Development Goals, with icons in our value creation process.Our value creat/i.loclTRKon process and bus/i.loclTRKness model
Keeping in mind 
the importance of sustainability initiatives for our country and the world we live in, we carry out our activities to increase our social contribution, reduce our negative environmental impact and offer innovative solutions to our customers.

We have a signi/f.alticant potential for 
sustainable value-creation as one of the leading players in the telecommu-nications sector. The telecommunica -
tions sector has the potential to save 10 times more carbon emissions than its own carbon footprint thanks to the innovative solutions provided to cus-tomers. Furthermore, mobile technol -
ogies offer great bene/f.altits for equality of opportunities among societies, and for access to /f.altinancial, health and ed -ucation services by expanding smart -
phone and broadband penetration, thereby providing access to various online services such as online banking.
We enhanced Turkcell’s existing sus -
tainability strategy in 2020 to create 
long-term value for our society. In this respect, we integrated Turkcell’s supe -
rior digital services, deep experience in the sector, core competencies, fo-cus on the Sustainable Development Goals and the high growth potential of our sector into the strategy. Turkcell’s sustainability strategy has been de -
veloped in accordance with our stra-tegic focus areas and business strat -
egy, by considering the sustainability potential of the telecommunications sector. We integrate our sustainability strategy into our business operations by carrying out activities under three main sustainability focus areas, “com -
bating climate change with the power of technology”, “accessible and inclu -
sive services focused on human hap -
piness” and “being a good corporate citizen”, and we implement practices with regards to these focus areas.
Relevant units of our Company re -
ceived sustainability and human rights 
trainings from GSMA in 2020. In 2021, activities have been initiated to ensure that all employees will receive train-ing on Sustainability and ESG policies.
In 2021, inclusive sustainability goals, 
which include renewable energy use and installation, increasing women’s employment, compliance of suppli -
ers from environmental, social and governance perspectives, the recy-cling of waste, and adaptation of Sustainability and its policies by all Turkcell employees, feature among the Company’s strategic goals, and are assigned as Key Performance In -
dicators for everyone from the Chief Executive Of/f.alticer to employees.
Our Company’s ESG Key Perfor -
mance Indicators (KPI) such as gen -
der equality, use of renewable energy, 
and employee training are included in our sustainability report, which we have published since 2011. These Key Performance Indicators are subject to BIST SI (Borsa Istanbul Sustain -
ability Index) and CDP evaluation.
We continue to establish systems to 
closely monitor sub-parameters re -
lated to ESG Key Performance In-dicators. When the respective data can be veri/f.altied, we present such KPIs together with local and internation -
al sector benchmarks as  part of our Sustainability Committee activities.
As a signatory to numerous 
international principles and programs such as UNGC, United Nations Women Empowerment Principles (UN WEPs), and GSMA’s Digital Declaration on Climate Change, we closely follow global developments in sustainability, taking the best practices in the /f.altield as a reference.

es and solutions has risen swiftly. As Turkcell, we have been pursuing our activities aware of this potential in the tech/f.altin /f.altield, catering to our custom -
ers with our services and solutions un -
der the Paycell and Financell brands. 
With Paycell, our vision is to integrate 
technology and /f.altinancial services in accordance with changing customer needs and habits, and to enable more customers to readily access /f.altinancial services by offering fast and secure payment solutions. Factors including Turkey’s large and young population, high smart device penetration, near -
ly 30 million unbanked potential us-ers, high prevalence of cash usage in shopping, rising e-commerce volumes and supportive regulatory develop -
ments, create a favorable environ-ment for increasing the penetration of digital payment services in Turkey and support the usage of solutions offered by Paycell. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has im -
pacted the world since the beginning of 2020, changed the payment hab -
its of people and increased the de-mand for digital payment services. As Paycell, we meet the digital payment needs of our customers through our wide payment solutions portfolio, and thereby facilitate their lives. Accord -
ingly, we introduce our services and solutions to our customers in various verticals including direct carrier billing, bill payment, e-wallet, money trans-fer and payment facilitation over our application, which we position as a Super App. In the fragmented tech/f.altin market in Turkey, where competition is focused on providing solutions in par -
ticular verticals, Paycell is differentiat -
ed by its strong positioning enabled by its wide portfolio of services, and its access to Turkcell’s deep technol -
ogy expertise, large customer base and sales channel. As part of its go to market strategy, Paycell focuses on increasing the number of merchants through mobile POS and QR payment solutions, while making efforts to raise the number of Super App users.  
Financell, the leader of the non-bank 
/f.altinancial sector by customer num -
ber, aims to contribute to the digital transformation of Turkey by becoming the /f.altinancing partner of Digital Busi-ness Services in accordance with our Group’s growth strategy in the cor -
porate segment. Under the Financell roof, we offer /f.altinancing solutions to our consumer and corporate segment customers for their purchases of tech -
nological products and services. We effectively manage credit risk by con -
ducting a faster credit assessment, leveraging our credit risk infrastructure and digital transformation capabil-ities. Meanwhile, we aim to become the largest Insurtech player in Turkey with the end-to-end digital solutions of Turkcell Sigorta. We offer innova -
tive solutions for customers’ risk man -
agement with fast and easy access products. In this respect, customers have the opportunity to conveniently access and purchase insurance prod -
ucts via all Turkcell channels including call center, digital channels and stores.

Material topics
The process of material topic identificationIn order to identify the 
material topics that guide our management approach and 2020 integrated annual report structure, we analyzed global and sectoral trends together with our key internal and external stakeholders’ views, global stakeholders’ reports, and the principles set out by international organizations such as GSMA, GRI and SASB.We identified the topics of the ques -
tionnaire, which we addressed to 
o
ur key stakeholders based on glob -
al trends and by incorporating the o
utputs of workshops with working 
groups, which include representatives from our key departments. We took priorities of our stakeholders into consideration while we conducted a comprehensive stakeholder anal -
ysis by reaching out to our internal and e
xternal key stakeholder groups 
through the questionnaire to receive their opinions. We evaluated and in -
terpreted the 2020 Turkcell materi -
al topics, which we classified under en
vironmental, social, governance, 
products, and infrastructure topics, from the perspective of our strategic focus areas and core competencies, as well as the results of stakeholder analysis. Following this stage, we in -
tegrated these topics with Turkcell’s sus
tainability material topics identi -
fied in previous reporting periods. As p
art of the external trend analysis, we 
analyzed SDGs, the World Economic Forum Global Risks Report 2020
*, and 
the initiatives that guide the busi -
ness world and mobile communica-
tion sector. We also took the reports 
p
ublished by companies operating in 
the same sector into consideration in order to assess their perspective on society and the sector. Having integrated the views of our senior management, we established Turk -

Competition management
Turkcell and Turkcell Group companies take various measures to ensure and protect effective competition in the markets where they operate, as well as to carry out business and transactions in accordance with the relevant com -
petition law and regulations. The main ob
jective of competition law is to pre -
vent dominant players in the market t
o abuse their power by establishing 
inter-company agreements, decisions and practices, which avoids, distorts or restricts fair competition. Moreover, the competition law controls merger and acquisition transactions to pre -
serve competition in the markets, and ma
kes necessary regulations and con -
ducts supervision to protect competi -
tion. In this context, certain processes ar
e followed within Turkcell, including, 
but not limited to the following:
• The guidelines, briefings and train -
ings prepared as part of the competi-
tion compliance process are examined 
b
y all employees.• In line with our general principles, 
any verbal or written agreements and communications with competitors on the following issues are avoided; price determination, sharing of customer/region, sharing of trade channels, re -
striction of supply amount or initiating a b
oycott, and collusion in tenders.
• Sharing sensitive information among 
competitors is prohibited. 
• Causing difficulties for the activities 
of competing companies, prevention 
of new entrance to the market, high sales prices and sales prices below cost are avoided.
• Resale prices of third parties that re -
sell Turkcell products and services are 
no
t interfered in by Turkcell. Recom -
mended sales price notification rules ar
e precisely followed.
Turkcell and Turkcell Group companies act in all their markets of operation in accordance with competition rules under the Turkish Commercial Code, the Law on the Protection of Compe -
tition, the Electronic Communications L
aw and secondary legislations. 
We disclose information on critical cases that Turkcell is a party to, as part of our disclosures to the BIST, SEC and other related authorities in com -
pliance with CMB and IFRS standards. In 
this context, critical cases arising 
from competition law are also includ -

eliminary research initiated, or in -
vestigation filed against our Company b
efore the Competition Authority for 
alleged violation of competition reg -
ulations under the Law on the Protec -
tion of Competition.Our employees, customers and suppliers can convey reasonable doubts and information regarding cases that violate, or may present a potential violation of business ethics to the Turkcell Ethics Committee anonymously through the Ethics Line (532 210 4444).

pected to reach 1.8 billion by 2025*.Ap
art from the telecom sector, 5G 
also opens the door to fundamen -tal changes in various sectors such as he
alth, automotive, entertainment 
and services. As a software-based technology, which will be central to several sectors, 5G is to drive strate -

TA.Trends and their impacts
2020 has been a turning point for the industry in which we operate. It highlighted the exciting and fun -
damental trends of recent years such as technological developments, changing economic structures and 
e
volving social needs. As Turkcell, we closely follow up on those trends, as well as issues such as COVID-19, 
mobility and climate change, and shape our business model and strategy to accurately address and man -
age such issues. As we have to date, so too in the future do we aim to introduce our country and our people wi
th the latest technologies via our domestic and national digital services developed by our engineers and 
software developers. We further aim to contribute to the digital transformation of our country and create value for all our stakeholders with our innovative and value-added solutions. While evaluating and analyzing such global trends, we make use of publicly available sources such as industry reports and opinions, as well as the reports of international organizations. This section includes insights into the prominent trends and Turkcell’s approach to managing them.
Big data
As the world comes to terms with the Industry 4.0 revolution, the business world is at the adaptation stage to this new era, where all information is instantly shared via the Internet of Things and creating big data, through digital transformation. Even though numerous companies recognize the potential value of big data, these companies still need to transform their technological infrastructure so as to benefit from the opportunities that can be achieved with big data predictions.
In the telecommunications world, a 
large amount of data is produced every day through social media net -
works, connected devices, customer b
ehavior, government service portals, 
call data records, billing information and similar sources. As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult for mobile operators to cope with rapid fluctuations in data volumes. While leading to difficulties for the tele -
communications industry in terms of t
echnical infrastructure requirements, 
big data also offers the opportunity to turn this challenge into an oppor -
tunity with big data analytics appli -
cations.
How do we manage?We work on this technology over the 5G test networks we established in select cities using the temporary 5G test frequencies allocated by the ICTA. In those test areas, we analyze the transition of our 4.5G network to 5G, observe 5G network performance and examine 5G network products. Moreover, we contribute to the de -
velopment of local 5G infrastructure wi
th the “End-to-End Domestic and 
National 5G Communication Network” Project that we signed as a stake -
holder in 2017, and which is carried o
ut within the scope of Communica -
tion Technologies Cluster (HTK) activ -
ities and supported by TÜBİTAK. With o
ur 5G test networks, we not only 
experience the technology itself, but also aim to establish a domestic and national 5G digital ecosystem by im -plementing 5G solutions for different v
ertical sector business models. We 
are happy to be the pioneer of numer -
ous 5G studies in our country for this p
urpose so far. We have taken various 
important steps in using 5G technolo -
gy ranging from communicating with dr
ones to pre-medical intervention to 
a patient while in the ambulance, from the first live TV broadcast over 5G to the VR experience in sports competi -
tions. Using our 5G test networks, we wi
ll continue to lead the establishment 
of a domestic and national 5G digital service ecosystem. Moreover, with our 5G R&D team, established in 2017, we participated in numerous national and international projects on focus areas determined in the 5G area and devel -
oped projects with our own resources. W
e have created a wide ecosystem 
through collaborations with regulato -ry and standardization organizations and univ
ersities and research insti -
tutions, and by working closely with man
y local and foreign institutions 
and organizations, including compa -
nies from various sectors. We actively under
took the Vice Presidency role in 
the “Machine Learning for Future Net -
works including 5G” focus group, es-
tablished under “ITU-T Study Group 
13 - F
uture networks with a focus on 
IMT-2020, cloud computing and trust -
ed network infrastructure (SG13)” that t
ook place between February 2018 
and June 2020. Furthermore, we con -
tinued to support the development of t
echnology by actively participating in 
the “Technologies for Network 2030” focus group established to work on 6G issues in SG13.How do we manage?
As Turkcell, we provide our corpo -
rate customers the opportunity to unders
tand the shopping habits of 
potential customers and reach them with our big data analytics services. Big data also enables us to interpret changes in the shopping habits of ex -
isting customers, and accordingly to o

 APPENDICESDigital transformation and inclusion
While the speed of accessing and processing information increases with rapidly developing mobile com -
munications technologies, the de-
pendency on physical locations and 
ass
ets decreases. These dynamics 
create valuable new opportunities for many individuals and institutions. The rapid and intense increase in global transactions over the internet with the COVID-19 pandemic shows that  new business models are to emerge that will potentially add value to the lives of users. According to a Forbes article, as of April, there was a year-on-year growth of 129% in e-com -
merce orders in the USA and Cana-
da. The fact that many companies s
tarted working remotely due to the 
pandemic, and that such applica -
tions were successful, suggests that 
r
emote working will continue par -
tially after the pandemic. This shows that the imp
ortance of services and 
applications in the field of commu -
nications will continue to rise in the up
coming periods.
Digitalization reduces the distance between people in different countries and rapidly increases the accessibil -
ity of digital applications, products and s
ervices. Mobile communica -
tion services cover 5.2 billion people ar
ound the world, corresponding to 
67% of the world’s population. The number of people with access to in -ternet through mobile applications has r
eached 3.8 billion, making the 
telecom sector one of the most ef -
fective channels for digital services t
o reach people. The telecom sector 
has great potential for eliminating in -
equalities around the world and for pr
oviding access to information and 
services, including financial services. Over the past 20 years, mobile tech -
nologies have accounted for about 10% f
or every USD100 increase in per 
capita income.* Additionally, with the mission of providing access to digi -
tal services, the telecom sector can p
ave the way for social development 
for various socio-economically dis -
advantaged groups, including wom-
en and the youth.

Climate change risks directly affect 
Turkcell’s business operations. As Turk -

tallation of base sta -
tions. We take measures against the risk
s of extreme weather events and 
natural disasters caused by climate change, and plan for the transfer of data centers to locations with cold climates, foreseeing a rise in average air temperatures in the long term. For our energy-focused activities, we turn to environmentally friend -
ly green energy resources within the f
ramework of Sustainable Develop -
ment Goals. We have implemented o
ur Turkcell Sustainability Strategy in 
2020, in line with our goals of meet -
ing all our electricity demand from re -
newable energy sources by 2030 and b
ecoming a carbon neutral company 
by 2050.Climate changeGlobal warming, which threatens the existence of life on earth and the im -
pacts of which are felt more inten -
sively each day in diverse perspec -
tives from daily life to government p
olicies, mainly results from human 
activities. Global warming triggers a series of chain reactions in economic, ecological and social life and causes global migration crises, resulting in an obstacle to economic activities, and epidemic diseases arising from the destruction of biological diversity. We acknowledge that climate change and biodiversity risks are interde -
pendent. As a recent example, scien -
tific studies show that COVID-19 has b
een mainly caused by issues associ -
ated with natural capital. With global w
arming continuing at an escalating 
pace, the studies indicate that all these interconnected problems will further escalate due to pandemic risk, climate risk and biodiversity risk.Considering forest fires, flood dis -
asters and incidents related to de -
struction of biodiversity, which have incr
eased in frequency all over the 
world in recent years and have be -
come extremely difficult to control, W
orld Economic Forum (WEF) de -
fined the top five global risks in terms o
f probability as climate-related risks 
in its 2020 Global Risk Report. In or -
der to manage these risks effectively, b
usinesses need to achieve net zero 
emissions rapidly and focus on the implementation of circular, renewa -

t is anticipated that the concept of 
mobility will not only trigger signifi -

Sustainable Finance relates to fi -
nancing activities where funding can 
b
e accessed based on a range of en -
vironmental, social and governance cri
teria. The climate crisis has led to 
the rising importance of non-finan -
cial risk factors for investors, and re -
porting on these factors has become wide
spread accordingly. With the 
support of the United Nations Glob -
al Compact, companies have started t
o manage their business strategies, corporate finance and investment activities in accordance with the tar -
gets determined within the frame -
work of the SDGs. In p
arallel to the increasing risks as -
sociated with climate change, sus -
tainable borrowing instruments are e
xpected to expand, while banks will 
set stricter rules on the sustainabili -
ty performance of the projects they financ
e. According to KPMG’s re -
port “The numbers are changing the w
orld”, 34% growth was registered 
in ESG impact investments between 2016 and 2019, and the ratio of sus-
tainable investment to total man -
aged assets in Europe reached 48.8%. T
he “European Green Deal”, issued at 
the end of 2019, underlines the critical importance of sustainable financing activities for financing investments and projects to be implemented within the scope of the long-term plan.
The accelerated digitalization, wid -
er use of cryptocurrency and block -
chain and the rising global smart -
phone penetration provide a conven -
ient environment for the development o
f financial technologies (fintech). 
According to the KPMG report “Pulse of Fintech”, the fintech field has made a significant improvement with the doubling of investments in the field between 2018 and 2019 compared to the period between 2014 and 2017. After the mega mergers and acqui -
sitions realized in fintech field in 2019, in
vestments in fintech-related servic -
es such as digital banking and con -
tactless payment systems rose with the e
ffect of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
especially in the first half of 2020, and fintech investments reached USD25.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Smartphones, which are the prima -
ry means used for internet access b
y people, play a facilitating role for 
many technologies and services, in -
cluding fintech. Fintech and mobile s
ervices have the potential to provide 
access to financial resources and services for the unbanked popula -
tions. As the World Bank’s 2017 Findex r
eport indicates, access to the finan -
cial systems provides the opportuni -
ty of financial and social independ -
ence, especially for those deprived o
f certain fundamental needs such 
as having a bank account, and also for women, corresponding to 56% of adult population. As 44% of its popu -
lation does not have a bank account ac
cording to the Interbank Card 
Center (BKM), Turkey has great poten -
tial in the fintech field with its young p
opulation and high smartphone use 
ratio. Through the legislative change that took effect as of July 2020, the concept of “Open Banking” has also taken root in Turkish banking legisla -
tion as a key step for fintech. Thus, the r
egulatory environment in Turkey 
has become more convenient for the development of fintech applications.Sustainable financing activities
The development of fintech applications
As we are well aware of the in -
creasing transparency and reporting e

 APPENDICESHow do we manage?
In parallel with the developments in the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyze new dynamics in the most efficient manner and respond quickly to the changing needs of our customers and society. As the importance of telecom services has risen significantly due to the rising demand for distant education, health and entertainment services,  we have improved our infrastructure and in -
creased our support to prevent any s
ervice disruptions. We supported dis -
tance learning by providing additional dat
a quotas for students and teach -
ers. We doubled the monthly internet quo
ta to 6 GB for “teachers and stu -dents” who will benefit from the EBA (
distance education platform) infra -
structure. We donated 15 GB data al -
lowance and 15 thousand minutes for thr
ee months to ensure that the field 
personnel of the Ministry of Health can work without communication disrup -
tions. During the transition period to r
emote working, we provided over 
1,600 corporate customers, some of which are among Turkey’s largest en -
terprises, the opportunity to manage dat
a centers remotely. We also stood 
by our customers through our digital services. BiP Meet offers a secure vid -
eo conferencing experience for online me
etings, while TV+ enables users to watch TV channels and movies. We offer fizy for music lovers, magazine applications for those who keen to read newspapers and magazines, as well as Yaani search engine, and Paycell for secure and fast payments without touching money or credit card. Moreover, all of these applications can be used by all operator users.

ur transaction volumes, commission 
revenues, advertising revenues and subscriptions are also growing. 
• The growing importance of mo -
bile applications with remote work -

the 
world to work remotely. This has 
increased the importance of com -
munication infrastructures, software and the s
ecurity of these systems for 
companies. Remote working is antici -

OVID-19 pandemic. As a leading 
technology company equipped to meet respective needs in this area, we provide services via our products such as BiP, Yaani Mail, lifebox and BiP Meet to high security standards.
Digital business services
• Increasing demand for data centers 
in accordance with regulations to store personal data in our country: In order to maintain data security and ensure privacy of personal data, as Turkey’s largest data center operator, we continue our activities with the vi -
sion that Turkey’s data should remain in T
urkey. In this context, regulatory ar -
rangements concerning the storage of c
ertain data in Turkey have increased 
the demand for our data centers, thus helping us improve our business and contributing to our revenues.• Global IT service providers to face 
difficulty in price competition due to currency impact: Due to the impact of currency movements, we are in a position to offer advantageous prices for our digital business services com -
pared to foreign service providers.
• Ab
sence of accepted major play -
ers in the new generation technolo-
gies market such as IoT and artificial 
in
telligence: We use our big data, IoT 
and artificial intelligence (AI) expe -
rience and competencies in various ar
eas including the development of 
products and services. The absence of accepted major players in IoT and artificial intelligence solutions, which are still developing areas, creates an advantage for Turkcell. The Republic of Turkey’s national vision to encour -
age development of domestic and nationa
l technologies, is considered 
as an opportunity for Turkcell.
• The increasing importance of re -
mote health services, distance learn -ing, remote working, and of products 
and s
ervices in these areas: The in -
creasing need for remote solutions during the p
andemic period led to 
increased demand for products and services, which we focus on, in the field of remote health, education and working solutions.

Turkcell, we also offer end-to-end digital transformation services via customized solutions to Turkish com -
panies and public institutions, togeth-

the 
positive perception of its 27 years 
brand in the eyes of customers, and its nationwide strong sales network, Turkcell has a competitive advantage in the medium-sized companies seg -

 APPENDICESCOVID-19 note
Due to measures taken during the 
pandemic period, including cur -
few restrictions, the use of data on mobi
le and fixed networks has in -
creased with greater time spent at home 
and the rising use of remote 
working and education platforms. This has resulted in a significant increase in the need for digitaliza -
tion. In this context, while rising de -
mand for our data and digital ser -
vices  and solutions has positively imp
acted our revenues, our inter -
national roaming revenues have no
tably decreased due to travel 
restrictions. Additionally, there were a number of delays to our corpo -
rate projects.
W
ith a focus on liquidity manage -
ment and collection risk  in order to 
ma
intain our strong financial per -
formance, we made dynamic rev -
enue projections and implement-
ed effective cost control actions. 
Me
anwhile, we prioritized revenue 
generation in planning our capital expenditures. During the pandem -
ic, we maintained communication wi
th our stakeholders with the 
same level of focus. We transpar -
ently communicated our risks, ex -
pectations and assessments to our s
takeholders in the COVID-19-fo -
cused teleconference meeting we or
ganized at the beginning of April. 
Subsequently, we shared updates on the subject during our quarter -
ly announcements and meetings wi
th our investors.
As Turkcell Group, going forward we plan to lead the digital trans -
formation process that has been ac
celerated by the COVID-19 
pandemic, leveraging our strong financial structure, innovative digi -
tal services and solutions, and our cus
tomer-oriented business ap -
proach. Ensuring the sustainability o
f this transformation and imple -
menting services that establish the d
igital backbone of Turkey remain 
key objectives of our financial ef -
forts.W
e view our financial capital as the 
key economic input of all activities we carry out on our journey towards creating stakeholder value. Ensuring the continuity of our superior service quality through our strong infrastruc -
ture, introducing our country and peo-
ple to the latest technologies, further 
impr
oving employment conditions, re -
alizing social responsibility projects of true b
enefit and creating shareholder 
value through dividends and increased market capitalization requires robust financial performance. In this respect, strong and sustainable financial per -
formance is among Turkcell’s material t
opics.
As part of our activities within the scope of financial capital, we aim for the revenues generated by our operations to deliver strong opera -
tional profitability through disciplined c
ost management practices. We also 
take measures to effectively manage our working capital and operational capex, thereby supporting the strong cash flow generation capability of our operations.
Our business model hedging practice 
is of great importance to us in terms of the sustainability of financial per -
formance. In this regard, we price our pr
oducts and services factoring in 
prevailing economic conditions in ac -
cordance with our inflationary pricing p
olicy, aiming to maintain real revenue 
growth and eliminate the inflationary impacts on our operational profitabili -
ty. Furthermore, through the active use o
f hedging instruments, we also pro -
tect our financials against exchange r
ate fluctuations, while securing our 
cash flows. Maintaining strong liquid -
ity resources provides a resilient posi -
tioning against macroeconomic crises. W
e ensure the efficient use of capital 
through the balanced management of our leverage level. Meanwhile, the effective management of our working capital with strong collection practic -
es supports our cash generation per -
formance.Revenues from operationsIn generating revenues from ope -
rations, we ensure the continuity o
f the innovative services we offer 
our customers, improve the emp -
loyment conditions of our emp-
loyees, contribute to the national 
e
conomy through our investments, 
and create value for our investors.
2020 was a year during which all 
macroeconomic developments reflected the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, as the world’s econo -
mies shrank on related disruption t
o the global supply chain and de -
mand.In this context, our business mod -
el hedging practices and successful b
udget management approach help 
transform our successful operational activities into strong financial results. Efficient capital allocation is anoth -
er core topic in terms of our financial c
apital. While carrying out activities 
to allocate our capital resources to more profitable areas that bring high -
er growth, we also aim to unlock the p
otential value of our assets in our 
balance sheet.
We closely monitor local and global 
debt and capital markets for the fi -
nancing of our operations and invest-
ments, meeting our financing needs 
thr
ough optimum funding methods by 
utilizing diverse borrowing instruments of appropriate currency, cost and ma -
turity structure. We effectively utilize b
oth traditional financing instruments 
such as bank loans and open credit lines, and capital market instruments such as bonds, lease certificates and Eurobond issuances in local and inter -
national markets.  As part of our solid c
orporate governance efforts, we dis -
close our financial management ap -
proach to our stakeholders through our in
tegrated annual reports and quar -
terly and annual results presentations, as w
ell as our website, and the meet -
ings we attend and organizations we hold.
 In line with the goal of increasing 
our Company’s market capitalization through transparent communication, we aim to develop and deepen the in -
vestor profile and increase the weight and numb
er of long-term institutional 
investors.Despite these 
developments, which affected Turkey and other markets in which we operate, we sustained our strong financial performance in 2020 thanks to our successful strategy and strong business model.

 APPENDICESWe have contributed 
over TRY50 billion to the Turkish economy since our establishment! The revenues generated from our operations enable us to support the economies of those countries in which we operate.We sustained our strong operational 
profitability in 2020 with the contri -
bution of remote working practices, the de
cline in travel expenses, the in -
creased share of digital sales channels, s
avings in marketing expenses and dis -
ciplined cost management practices. A
ccordingly, EBITDA increased by 17.7% 
to TRY12.3 billion, while the EBITDA mar -
gin rose to 42.2%. Our EBIT margin was 21.6%.
 In a period, during which macro -economic uncertainties prevailed due t
o the pandemic, and while the Turkish 
Lira depreciated 24% and 35% against the US Dollar and Euro, respectively, we registered  strong net income on the back of our robust operational perfor -
mance and prudent financial risk man-
agement practices. Accordingly, our 
ne
t income rose 30.5% on a yearly ba -
sis to TRY4.2 billion, marking the historic hig
h achieved by our company.We will  be able to finance the tele -
com equipment procurements to be made o
ver the next 3 years in Euros 
and Renminbi (RMB) as part of the EUR500 million, 8-year maturity loan agreement signed with the China De -
velopment Bank (CDB) in 2020 for the financing o
f our infrastructure invest -
ments. Having signed this long-term lo
an agreement at favorable terms, 
we have encouraged local currency trade with foreign suppliers, strengt -
hening trust both in Turkcell and Tur -
key’s economy. Furthermore, we sig-
ned a loan agreement of US$90 mil -
lion in December 2020 with ING BANK 
N.V
. and AB Svensk Exportkredit within 
the framework of the insurance of the Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN) for the financing of products and ser -
vices procured from Ericsson AB and Ericss
on Telekomünikasyon A.Ş. The 
loan agreement comprises three tran -
ches, each with a maturity of 10 years.
R
egarding the revenues we generate 
from operations, free cash flow ge -neration is among the issues that we 
f
ocus on the most. Our free cash flow 
generation performance, which was at a negative level between 2014 and 2018, particularly due to the frequency and network investments made in re -
lation to 4.5G technology, turned po -
sitive in 2018 upon completion of tho-
se investments in large part, and was 
f
ollowed by a rising trend of strong 
operational performance. We sustai -
ned our solid financial performance in 2020
, creating free cash flow of TRY3.4 
billion. We intend to continue this per -
formance until the next technology in
vestment cycle, by maintaining suc -
cessful operational performance and ensuring 
disciplined capital expenditu -
re and working capital management.A
s Turkcell, we operate in 4 countries, 
creating value through economic, so -
cial and technological development. W
e also contribute to the digitaliza -
tion of other nations by exporting our sup
erior digital services, knowledge 
and experience to 37 countries. 
We support the economy and GDP of other countries, as our operations and services result in increased economic activity, creating job opportunities and generating tax revenue.
Business model hedging
Business model hedging is one of our key focus areas in sustaining strong financial performance. In this con -
text, we price our products accord -
ing to prevailing economic conditions, ac
tively protect our balance sheet 
against exchange rate fluctuations using hedging instruments, and effec -
tively manage our liquidity resources. During the p
andemic period collection 
performance management has also been an issue of greater focus.As Turkcell, we pay attention to the right pricing of the value proposition we offer to our customers. While im -
plementing pricing, it is vital to take e
conomic conditions into account for 
the sustainability of our services. In this respect, we focus on pricing our products and services to reflect in -
flation. Our inflationary pricing prac -
tice contributes primarily to achiev -
ing sustainable real revenue growth, whi
le helping to eliminate inflationary 
pressure on our costs, and thereby protecting our operational profitabili -
ty. Moreover, as we determine our in -
vestment budget based on generated r
evenues, we also protect our capital 
expenditures against exchange rate fluctuations, reflecting the impact of such fluctuations to our revenues in the long run through inflationary pric -
ing. Leveraging our analytical compe -
tencies and using big data effectively, w
e price our products and services by 
understanding the needs of our cus -
tomers, and reflecting inflation trends. A
ccordingly, we offer the right price to 
the right customer at the right time.
We support our robust operational 
and financial performance with strong ARPU generation backed by inflation -
ary pricing practice. Meanwhile, our gr
owing postpaid subscriber base, ris -
ing data usage and our upsell strate -
gy also support ARPU generation. We e
xpect our ARPU performance to trend 
with the inflation path in the long term.When our non-operational capital ex -
penditures are included, we have made a t
otal  investment of TRY32 billion over 
the past 5 years. We have contributed to cost savings and the development of domestic technologies by supplying part of our network equipment from domestic production.Operating in the telecom sector brings 
responsibilities such as having a strong infrastructure capable of meeting ris -
ing capacity needs and regularly intro -
ducing customers to new technologies. T
he revenues derived from our opera -
tions and our ability to generate strong c
ash flows, along with our financing 
resources, allow us to continue our in -
frastructure investments and introduce o
ur customers to the technologies of 
tomorrow. Duly, our operational capital expenditures (excluding license fees) in 2020 amounted to 18.5% of our to -
tal revenues. During this period, while ma
king investments we followed a 
disciplined approach supportive of our goal of increasing customer satisfac -
tion, providing social benefit and sup -
porting our revenue generation.

 APPENDICESWe follow a prudent risk management 
approach within the framework of our business model hedging practice. In this respect, we hold the bulk of our cash in hard currencies as a natural hedging mechanism. As of the end of 2020, excluding FX swap transac -
tions, 74% of our cash is in USD, 4% is in EUR and 22% is in TR
Y. In addition, 
we actively use hedging tools within the scope of our prudent risk manage -
ment approach. Utilizing these tools, w
e convert our floating rate foreign 
currency denominated debt into fixed rate Turkish Lira debt. While 78% of our total debt before hedging transactions is in foreign currency as at the end of 2020, the ratio declines to 43% when the effects of hedging instruments are included. In order to reduce our risk by diversifying our foreign exchange transactions and position, we also prioritize local currency trade when making payments to our suppliers. This year, we signed Turkish Lira denomi -
nated payment agreements with our lar
gest suppliers to protect our foreign 
exchange denominated assets. Thanks to our successful hedging practices, we were able to turn our foreign ex -
change position, which was negative in 20
18, to positive in 2019. As at the 
end of 2020, we have a net FX long position of USD132 million. Going for -
ward, we aim to maintain our foreign e
xchange position at a neutral-positive 
level in order to minimize the impact of exchange rate movements on our financials.Hedging tools also protect us against interest rate risk in the market. Accord -
ingly, approximately 39% of our total deb
t has a floating interest rate as at 
the end of 2020, while our fixed rate borrowing share is at approximately 94% including the effects of hedging instruments. Also vital to the risk man -
agement approach is the fact that the he
dging tools that we use cover both 
principal and interest payments of the respective debt service to maturity. In this respect, the terms of our hedg -
ing agreements are protected against fluc
tuations in market conditions. 
Moreover, we work with well-known, reputable and reliable counter parties when entering into these agreements. 
As a telecom company that operates 
in emerging markets, we must always be prepared for ups and downs in fi -
nancial markets, and sustain a strong l
iquidity position accordingly to ensure 
operational continuity. Liquidity man -
agement is therefore a crucial area f
or our financial capital. In this respect, 
we hold TRY11.9 billion in cash, mostly in foreign currency on our balance sheet as at the end of 2020. This amount is sufficient to cover our entire debt ser -
vice until the end of 2024.
In add
ition to our strong cash position, 
our committed credit lines of USD727 
million, as well as our strong free cash flow generation performance support our liquidity position.
Another crucial focus area concern -
ing liquidity is debt management. De -
spite the significant depreciation of the T
urkish Lira against the US Dollar 
and Euro in 2020, we managed to low -
er our leverage level (net debt/EBIT -
DA) to 0.8x, thanks to our strong cash 
gener
ation performance. Until the next 
technology investment cycle, our goal will be to lower our leverage level with strong cash flow generation, and to prepare for future investments.As at the end of 
2020, we have a net FX long position of USD132 million. Going forward, we aim to maintain our foreign exchange position at a neutral-positive level in order to minimize the impact of exchange rate movements on our financials.

 APPENDICESAdditionally, the synchronized mone -
tary and fiscal expansion of govern -
ments and central banks to mitigate 
the de
vastating effects of COVID-19 
have caused the declining interest rates to fall to historic low levels. In this respect, we prepaid the USD1 billion syndicated loan, which we had utilized to finance infrastructure investments and potential investment opportunities as part of the agreement signed with BNP Paribas, Citibank, HSBC, ING and Intesa Sanpaolo banks in 2015, there -
by optimizing our financing costs. Fur-
thermore, we extended our debt ma -
turity with the long-term loans utilized 
thr
oughout the year.
Collection performance has been an area of increased focus, particularly during the pandemic period. While we took timely actions for collections, our customers were also sensitive to bill payments given that telecom services are an integral part of their lives. These two factors enabled us to maintain our strong collection performance in 2020. 
We also sustained a robust collection 
performance with respect to our fi -
nancing business in 2020 in the pan -
demic environment, keeping our cost o
f risk below sector averages. We 
follow a prudent approach to granting loans to customers. We take several metrics including the payment perfor -
mance of our customers with respect t
o their telecom bills, as well as cred -
it bureau scores into consideration as p
art of our evaluation process. This ap -
proach forms the basis of our strong c
ollection performance. We transferred our 41.5% stake in Fin -
tur Holdings B.V. to Sonera Holding B
.V. in 2019 as part of our efficient 
capital allocation focus. The cash in -
flow that resulted from this transac -
tion helped us improve our leverage r
atio and liquidity, and strengthen our 
foreign exchange position.
Moreover, as part of the support we 
provide to infrastructure sharing pro -
jects, we share fixed infrastructure wi
th Türksat and Vodafone, which 
enables us to reach more households with our services and achieve effi -
ciencies. Going forward, the poten -
tial for passive infrastructure sharing, p
articularly for fiber, will continue to 
be evaluated. In parallel to global trends, we believe that infrastructure sharing has the potential to create operational savings as well as sup -
port the national economy via the e
fficient use of resources.
Efficient capital allocationThe biggest challenges facing the tel -
ecom industry on a global scale are hig
h capex requirements and slow 
revenue growth due to competition. For this reason, many telecom com -
panies around the world are lower-
ing their resource allocation in the 
tr
aditional telecom business through 
public offerings, M&A transactions, infrastructure sharing, and sell and leaseback transactions, while in -
vesting into higher growth areas. As T
urkcell, we also invest in areas of 
low investment requirement such as digital services, techfin services, and information technologies, focusing on digital efficiency, and adopting the “Asset-Light” approach to support our economic growth. Going forward, our goal will be to achieve balanced revenue growth through traditional telecom businesses and new invest -
ment areas. Moreover, we are plan -
ning to also finance our investments in ne
w businesses with free cash flow 
generation and active portfolio man -
agement activities, along with debt financing.
 As part of active portfolio 
management, we aim to unlock the value 
  o
f the assets in our balance 
sheet by carrying out capital market or private transactions when suitable market conditions and investor appe -
tite exist. Div
ersified financing
By leveraging our established market relations, we aim to utilize alterna -
tive funding methods and resources in p
ursuit of financing diversity, be -
side our strong equity position. We uti
lize loans obtained from domestic 
and foreign banks, issue Eurobonds in international markets, bonds, bills, lease certificates and Asset Backed Securities in local markets, and obtain ECA loans for financing procurements from foreign suppliers. We also use sustainable financing (sustainability indexed loan, green loan) as part of diversified funding resources.We play a leading role in Turkey in terms of accessing sustainable fi -
nancing sources. In 2019,  utilizing a “S
ustainability Linked Loan” of EUR50 
million with 3-year maturity from BNP Paribas, we further strengthened our leading position in funding activi -
ties through sustainable financing. In 2020
, we entered into a 5-year 
maturity, EUR50 million “Green Loan Agreement” with ING to finance our environmentally-friendly investments in renewable energy, energy efficien -
cy, green digital services and green b
uildings, strengthening our position 
in this field.
Strong and transparent financial managementIt is also of importance for our cor -
porate structure that we have a tr
ansparent and accountable finan -
cial management, as well as a robust one
. We plan, manage and analyze 
our budget effectively within the scope of this transparent and strong financial management approach. In our countries of operation, we manage our tax practices transpar -
ently and accountably, directly and ind
irectly, and disclose them via our 
annual reports, material disclosures, and quarterly and annual results re -leases. Across the company, we share in
formation in many different formats, 
including share performance report -
ing, senior management reports and b
enchmarking analysis.
In line with being an exemplary corporate citizen, we carry out an -
ti-bribery and anti-corruption activ -
ities with zero-tolerance, and act in ac
cordance with legislation to main -
tain an effective competitive market en
vironment. We conduct all our fi -
nancial transactions in accordance wi
th CMB and SEC regulations.We also sustained 
a robust collection performance with respect to our financing business in 2020 in the pandemic environment, keeping our cost of risk below sector averages.

We digitize the operating model of the /f.altinance function in or -
der to provide an environment where business processes are organized over systems, manual interventions are minimized, and internal control points are automatically supported. As part of this transformation, we aim to improve operational ef/f.alticiency as well as establish a working environ -
ment comparable to best practices.
In this context, our current /f.altinancial 
maturity level was assessed, pro-gress areas were determined, and roadmaps were established in detail. Upon completion of the transforma -
tion, which considers every compo-nent of the operating model ranging from process to technology, and from organization to data, 68% of the /f.alti -

Tech/f.altin’s shining stars:   
Paycell ve FinancellIn 2020, we continued to improve the products and services we offer to our customers under Paycell. Pay -
cell, which serves over 12 thousand contracted merchants, expanded its solution portfolio for commercial businesses with the Android POS this year. Paycell Android POS, the /f.altirst Android POS device to comply with relevant legislation, and approved by the Turkish Revenue Administration (GİB), provides cost and ef/f.alticiency advantages to member merchants, while offering collection, stock track -
ing and e-invoice processes on a single platform. The Paycell Single Account project conducted in 2020, enabled users to view and easily manage their Paycell Card balance and mobile payment limits in a single account. Also in 2020, we took an im -
portant step by enabling 24/7 money transfer service to an  IBAN number with contracted banks. Moreover, we offered a completely contact-less payment experience by improv-ing the payment process at physical points in the pandemic period, during which contactless payments became more popular as customers sought new payment methods. Having en -
tered into new agreements with numerous restaurants, markets and coffee chains, we ensured that cus -
tomers could make their purchases contactless with QR codes.
Paycell enables customers to make 
purchases at member merchants without the need of a bank card or payment at the door, offering the op -
portunity to re/f.altlect the fee to telco bills. Paycell also provides the oppor -
tunity of paying corporate bills both using the application and at Turkcell stores. With the rising number of con-tracted merchants each year, Paycell customers can shop quickly and se -
curely using QR codes. Meanwhile, Paycell Card offers the opportunity of using a card to  those under the age of 18, and therefore unable to be a bank customer. At the same time, Paycell Card customers can manage their balance and mobile payment limits through a single account.
Paycell registered a /f.altirst this year by 
adding a brand new easy payment alternative. Thanks to the “Ready to use limit” feature, users can spend their mobile payment limits via their Paycell Cards at any time, and repay through their Turkcell bill at the end of the month. Moreover, they can con -
vert part of this personalized limit into funds and withdraw them in cash.
Carrying out activities that consider 
the needs of our customers, we suc -
cessfully ended 2020 having posted record transaction volumes across various products. Paycell increased its revenues by 13% this year, while its EBITDA margin was 52%. Payce -
ll’s non-group revenues rose by 62% during the same period. The number of Paycell 3 month-active users have become 4.7 million, and the number of Paycell registered credit cards reached 7.9 million with an increase of 88%.

 APPENDICESWe consider 
Turkcell employees as members of a large productive family, who carry out activities with the aim of creating social value by leveraging skills in their area of expertise, and as the key asset of Turkcell. 
During Turkcell’s 
digital transformation journey, we continue to receive the greatest support from our employees thanks to Turkcell’s strong communication and interaction culture. We aim to ensure an employment experience that makes our employees feel more valuable and productive, and hence happier. This approach is an integral part of our corporate culture.Human capital management
Throughout our journey of activities that serve our people with prod -
ucts and services that reflect Turkcell qua
lity, it is our priority to imbue our 
employees with a sense of pride in being part of the Turkcell family. We comply with legal requirements as part of our human resource process -
es in accordance with relevant laws and r
egulations. We communicate 
all operational changes that could significantly impact our employees within the legal notice period via our internal communication channels. We consider it among our core eth -
ical values 
  t o oppose discrimination 
based on gender, age, belief, ethnic -
ity, nationality, marital status, health s
tatus, and physical capacity in all of 
Turkcell’s business activities. Respect for human rights lies at core of our hu -
man resources activities. Accordingly, w
e implement human resources prac -
tices that ensure equal opportunities f
or all individuals, and support inclu -
sion and diversity. As the large Turkcell Gr
oup family of 24,675 employees, we 
adapt to the requirements of the rap -
idly evolving digital age with agility t
o better respond to customer needs. 
And we continuously develop our skills with training programs that offer rich content.
Under the leadership of the Turkcell 
HR Center of Excellence team, we carry out activities regarding the de -
sign of all our human resources pro -
cesses, changes and improvements t
o our procedures, as well as wage 
policies and the performance and development management of our employees. With the cooperation of Turkcell teams and our Organization -
al Development directorate, we carry o
ut exemplary activities in determin -
ing the goals and risks of our business pr
ocesses, defining roles and respon -
sibilities and digitizing of our human r
esources management.Our decent business practicesWe carry out all of our human re -
sources activities with a focus on val -
ue creation with the responsibility of b
eing an exemplary corporate citizen 
both in our country and globally. We hear the expectations of the strong and agile Turkcell family with regards to business management, and take swift actions to increase employee loyalty and satisfaction. We aim to make sure that Turkcell is the most preferred workplace in the eyes of our employees through the combina -
tion of our decent business practices and “Dig
ital HR” vision.
Diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity
Respect for human rights is at the core of our human resources activi -
ties. In this regard, our human resourc -
es practices extend equal opportuni -
ties to all individuals, supporting inclu-
sion and diversity. Turkcell carries out 
i
ts activities to prevent discrimination, 
inequality, human rights violations, forced labor and child labor within the scope of its Human Rights Poli -
cy and continues its efforts to adopt the
se values across its supply chain.
All related activities and practices confirm our commitment to our equal opportunity, inclusion and diversity principles. In 2020, there were no cas -
es of discrimination brought against T
urkcell İletişim Hizmetleri A.Ş. by our 
employees or third parties, and no lawsuits were filed against Turkcell for discrimination. 
We state our commitment to compli -
ance with the principles set forth in 
o
ur Human Rights Policy announced 
at the beginning of 2021 as part of our relations with our employees, customers, business partners and all our stakeholders. Thereby, we aim to ensure compliance to requirements of national legislation and international capital markets regulations that we are subject to, regarding employment conditions. COVID-19 note:In 2020, employment and work -
ing conditions were reshaped by the C
OVID-19 pandemic. Yet, we 
continued our recruitment activ -
ities to meet increasing custom-
er demand, as well as achieve 
o
ur digitalization goals. While 
carrying out activities, we also supported the national econo -
my via our successful employ -
ment practices. Having already c
onducted office independent 
working practices such as “mo -
bile working” and “office station” f
or over 3 years, we were able to 
rapidly adapt to different remote working models such as mobile working and home office when COVID-19 entered the picture. We provided our field employ -
ees with the necessary hygien -
ic materials. Moreover, we took ne
cessary actions to ensure our 
employees’ physical and psycho -
logical safety. To enable them to sp
end more quality time while 
working remotely, increase so -
cialization and enhance team mo
tivation, we organized remote 
training courses, online company activities, and various programs aimed at healthy living. In this period, we also received instant feedback from our employees, and developed our processes and principles in light of the in -
formation gathered. As part of the ‘C
OVID-19 Virtual Working 
Assessment Survey’ conducted by Kincentric and scored by our employees, we achieved robust results on each of the following main topics: ‘Anxiety and Con -
nectivity’, ‘Senior Management Appr
oach, Communication’, ‘Em -
ployee Health, Well-being, Oc -
cupational Safety’, and ‘Virtual W
ork Efficiency’. The survey re -
sults confirmed Turkcell as being among 
the top-ranked compa -
nies in Turkey in terms of positive p
erception. We also scored high -
er results in comparison to global c
ompanies across all metrics.SDG 10.4
We respect the rights of our employ -
ees arising from employee-employ -
er relations, and protect these rights wi
th our human resource practices. 
With our equal pay for equal work policy, there is no basic salary differ -
ence between our female and male emplo
yees. In order to prevent the 
incidence of child labor and debt bondage, we adopt the ILO (Interna -
tional Labor Organization) standards acr
oss our entire value chain, particu -
larly for our suppliers.

Turkcell launched the Young Talent Program in 2016 to re-
cruit talented young people. T
he need to “quickly master 
difficult jobs” that comes with digitalization, increases the importance of flexible and agile teams. Today’s business world is looking for versatile talent. The main purpose of our employment policy is to add talents who will resolute -
ly achieve results, pursue their dr
eams, possess high techno -
logical aptitude, and who can quickly adap
t to new condi -
tions. As a result, we open our do
ors to professionals who are 
experts in their fields, as well as young people who have just began their career. A key innovation of the program this year was the development of online application and evalua -
tion processes to provide 100% e
qual opportunity for disabled 
candidates. As a result of this, 3 visually impaired candidates who successfully passed all stages joined the Turkcell fami -
ly as Young Talents. We see the Y
oung Talent program not only 
in terms of youth employment, but also as an investment in new human resources required for digital transformation that will carry our country into the future.Our agile teamsAt Turkcell, we consider our business units’ agility, strength and flexibility to be the greatest source of our suc -
cess. With agile teams being one of the 
four main competencies toward 
achieving Turkcell’s strategic initia -
tives, we work to establish a flexible and ag
ile structure from Network to 
Finance, and from Law to Marketing, across our entire productive Turkcell family. In 2020, we improved our or -
ganizational structure even further in t
erms of agility. We are proud to 
have increased the number of agile teams this year from 85 to 181, helping us to take full advantage of our em -
ployees’ talent and experience. We e
ffectively manage our company re -
sources to realize our strategic focus ar
eas. We maximize agility by opti -
mizing our business processes with o
ur end-to-end value-generating 
organizational structure. The organ -
izational structures of new business ar
eas are updated according to mar -
ket needs. We determine application ar
eas by monitoring the performance 
of the pilot applications of our agile working model. And through master and management programs we con -
tinuously invest in our human capital, bring
ing young talent to Turkcell with 
the most comprehensive recruitment program in Turkey.
Making a difference in employment
As one of Turkey’s 
largest employers, we are a vast family of over 24,000 employees with our local and international subsidiaries.
Despite the adverse conditions of the 
pandemic during 2020, our human resources strategic planning success -
fully increased our business volume wi
thout delaying recruitment. Given 
our aim of providing a superior digital product and service experience, and our increasing workload in this peri -
od, we continue to seek professionals o
f technological expertise. Yet we do 
not limit our recruitment to these ar -
eas alone; we continue to recruit in man
y areas ranging from information and communication technologies 
to finance, and from marketing and sales to human resources. As Turkey’s digital operator, we have largely dig -
italized our recruitment process and emplo
yee experience. In this context, 
especially during the pandemic pe -
riod, we have made increased use o
f online assessment tools, employ -
ing artificial intelligence technology in o
ur recruitment process as part of 
our innovative approach. In our new graduate recruitment process, dur -
ing the video interview phase, we hav
e used artificial intelligence in the 
mood-assessment of approximately 3,000 candidates. When the results of one-on-one interviews we con -
duct match with artificial intelligence ana
lysis, we deem it as an indicator 
of success for our evaluation process. Our use of artificial intelligence in re -
cruitment will continue to increase.We draw particular attention to so -
cial equality of opportunity and an -
other priority topic, women’s employ -
ment, with the Women Engineers Pr
oject. We offer job opportunities at 
Turkcell by developing special work -
ing models for women who have nev -
er worked before, or who are current -
ly unable to work for various reasons such as marriage or
 motherhood. 
Accordingly, we conducted a project launched with the “Equal Conditions, Equal  Chances” motto, aimed at in -
creasing the employment of women eng
ineers in 2 phases. The first phase 
involved advertisements for female engineers who are 3
rd and 4th grade 
students. Following the evaluation of received applications, we conducted general skill and technical tests, and one-on-one human resource inter -
views. 101 people who successfully c
ompleted the process were entitled 
to participate in 6-week IOS, Java, C# and Android trainings. Those who successfully complete the program in the technology camp, set to take place in the digital environment with projects created by expert instructors, will have the opportunity to work at Turkcell, either part time or full time. Our efforts to increase the employ -
ment of women who have taken a br
eak from their career, which is the 
second phase, is ongoing.New hires*

nologies. In the meantime, by impro -
ving our service quality, we also grow o
ur revenues.
Expanding our strong fiber infrastruc -
ture annually, we grow the number of fi
ber-connected base stations. More -
over, we provide fiber access to hou -
seholds in additional cities.Mobi
le infrastructure
Our mobile infrastructure possesses a smart and flexible network structure comprising mainly our base stations. We carry out activities aiming to im -
prove the coverage area and dura -
bility of our base stations and towers, which f
orm the basis of our telecom 
business, thereby increasing the ac -
cessibility of our services.
Bas
e stations
Having adopted an approach pri -
oritizing public health, we operate 
o
ur base stations utilizing the latest 
technologies and in compliance with national regulations and international standards. We also locate our base stations accordingly to avoid creat -
ing any sort of visual pollution.
T
he base stations in our network are 
well equipped to demonstrate all ca -
pabilities of the technology that we 
pr
ovide to our customers. 
Meanwhile, our base stations, which can offer multiple technology support (singleRAN), can be defined as envi -
ronmentally friendly with their more c
ompact size and lower energy con -
sumption.
Mor
eover, we conduct risk assess -
ment tests to ensure the safety of our b
ase stations and our teams work -
ing in the field. Having conducted risk ass
essment tests at 8,832 base sta -
tion sites in 2019 and 10,281 in 2020, w
e are one step closer to achieving our short-term target of conducting 10,800 risk assessment tests each year. We aim to minimize risk factors to the greatest possible extent by im -
plementing improvement actions for ar
eas identified as a result of these 
assessments.

Base stations and public healthIn order to prevent any negative im -
pact on public health, our base sta -
tions must operate below the elec-
tromagnetic field intensity threshold 
le
vels 
  de
termined by the Regulatory 
Authority, the ICTA. These thresholds were 
  de
termined by the ICTA with a 
prudent approach at lower and saf -
er levels compared to the exposure l
imits 
  de
termined by the Internation -
al Non-Ionizing Radiation Protec-
tion Board (ICNIRP) and accepted 
b
y the World Health Organization 
(WHO). As per research in this field, no harm to human health has been identified from radio signals below ICNIRP limits. The threshold levels defined for Turkey by regulation are at 70% of the limits 
  de
termined by 
ICNIRP, and at 25% per device. The maximum limits 
  that 
a base station 
can be operated at in our country are much lower (approximately 1/4) compared to limits 
  s
et for European 
Union countries.
We are subject to the ICTA and 
its respective regulations with re -
gards to installation and inspection o
f base stations. As part of the in -
stallation process of a base station, in
formation regarding the power 
specifications, the antenna type, location of the station and its sur -
rounding is reported in detail to the IC
TA. The base stations can be in -
stalled in approved locations. Once a b
ase station is activated, EMR 
(Electromagnetic Field) measure -
ment is conducted by independent ins
titutions accredited by the ICTA 
within one week, with the results submitted to the ICTA. Moreover, the ICTA also conducts inspections and measurements on the base stations. As part of the two ICTA criteria that stand out with respect to public health, there should be no living space within the “Safety Dis -
tance” determined based on the p
ower output of the base station, 
while its electromagnetic field in -
tensity, having been configured ac -
cordingly, should be within the legal l
imits. Should any failure to comply 
with the relevant ICTA criteria be detected, the base stations are dis -
mantled, with significant sanctions or
 penalties imposed.
As Turkcell, we effectively manage the impact of our network oper -
ations on public health by imple -
menting much stricter limits com -
pared to those set by the legal authori
ties. In 2020, there were no 
cases that resulted in legal penal -
ties against our Company with re -
gards to the impact on health of our pr
oducts and services.
*  Total data volume: mobile + fixedStrong infrastructure and 
superior service quality
We ensure the delivery of 
reliable and high speed services to our customers leveraging superior digital competencies, strong financial management and 27 years of experience in the telecom sector. We closely follow technological trends and develop world-class applications to maintain strong infrastructure and superior service quality, which are among the material topics for Turkcell and our stakeholders. While carrying out activities to support the development of domestic technologies, we also engage in international projects and promote our brand beyond our country. We are proudly the largest data center operator in Turkey, carrying out our activities in this area in support of domestic technology development. We operate our base stations with an approach that ensures compliance with national and international standards with a performance that goes beyond their minimum requirements, paying utmost attention to the health of our valuable customers and overall society.Along with infrastructure investments, 
we take measures to increase the ef -
ficiency of our network implementing ne
w technologies so as to effecti -
vely manage the annually increasing ne
twork traffic of our customers. 
Hence, we do not compromise on service quality even during busy pe -
riods by maintaining efficient use of ne
twork resources. The rise in traffic, 
particularly in 2020 due to COVID-19, which was higher than expected, once again underlined the importan -
ce of infrastructure investments and e
fficiency efforts for service quality.
COVID-19 noteCurfew measures, increa -
sing remote working and r
emote education practices, 
have resulted in significant rise in fixed internet usage and 4.5G data traffic. Ac -
cordingly, we took measu -
res to increase capacity and me
et additional 4.5G traffic 
load on the network during this period. We continue our activities to effectively ma -
nage the higher demand f
or data usage over Super -
box and fiber offerings, and pr
ovide high quality service.

 APPENDICESAs part of our activities carried out 
at base station sites, we encounter occupational health and safety risks in relation to issues including working at height, electrical works, excava -
tion works, and vehicle use. In order t
o avoid these risks, we rely on our 
working principles and action plans. Until the end of 2020, 4,051 sites were inspected, risk analysis forms were prepared for 1,449 sites, and 590 sites were repaired for a safer working en -
vironment.
Mor

a
im to ensure that our base stations 
operate efficiently, in an environmen -
tally friendly manner and in accord -
ance with health and safety regu-

ation times.In
tegrated infrastructure  with 
redundant sourcesWe completed the convergence of our fixed and mobile transmission in -
frastructure in the transmission aggre -
gation layer. Having implemented this ne
w design, we optimized investments 
through the use of shared network de -
vices for fixed and mobile infrastruc -
ture. Accordingly, we created a trans -
mission network with a shared archi-
tecture for fixed and mobile services. 
Other
 benefits of the new transmis -
sion network, the standards of which hav
e already been shaped, may be 
listed as:
• Ability to position higher capacity 
devices in the transmission aggrega -
tion layer• Cr
eating a backhaul structure to 
meet 5G service needs• Ease of operational management
Our Fixed Mobile Convergence Project 
in this field received the Best Network Transformation Initiative award at the Asia Communication Awards in 2020. 
We are able to access our network 
data centers with high redundancy through our flexible transmission infra -
structure with redundant sources. We c
ontinue our network investments in 
our large data centers built in Ankara and Izmir following the one in Gebze, Kocaeli. Having opened the Istanbul Europe data center, we will focus our network investments in our large data centers, which we have recently built. Thus, while increasing investment ef -
ficiency, we are constantly building a s
tronger communication infrastructure 
against natural disasters.Telco cloudWe have virtualized 50% of our mobile and fixed core network infrastructure to date. On the back of virtualiza -
tion, we integrated infrastructures for ne
twork applications and achieved 
CAPEX and OPEX savings through horizontal and vertical architectures. Along with investment savings, we have been able to deliver services faster using similar hardware and in -
frastructure for virtualized services and s
olutions. In 2020, we completed 
our core network infrastructure migra -
tion to virtual infrastructure with re -
spect to mobile internet and HD voice s
ervices over 4.5G. Going forward, we 
will be making mobile core network investments entirely on the Telco cloud infrastructure.
TowersGlobal Tower, the leading tower com -
pany in Turkey and one of our sub-
sidiaries, operates in four countries. 
Pr
oviding services to telecom opera -

Strong fiber infrastructure
As the Company that introduced Tur -
key to fiber internet at the speed of l
ight, we provide fast, high quality 
and inclusive services to our custom -
ers, and facilitate everyone’s access t
o information and the internet. As 
Turkcell, we brought fiber infrastruc -
ture to all 81 cities of Turkey. We are a
lso able to provide corporate and 
wholesale services in every city of Turkey. We work relentlessly to deliv -
er Turkcell quality everywhere.
W
e provide a fiber internet service to 
households in 23 cities, and continue 
to expand our coverage. We continue to invest during the pandemic peri -
od. And we develop our fiber internet in
frastructure, higher speed internet 
tariffs and new technological solu -
tions. As Turkcell, we provide fiber br
oadband access to households at 
speeds of up to 10 Gbps via globally accepted G-PON/XGS-PON technol -
ogy. This value is an upper limit and may 
vary depending on variables 
such as tariff type, fiber internet us -
age density, and the maximum speed the mo
dem can support. While the 
average fixed internet speed in Tur -
key is around 28 Mbit, 90% of Turk -
cell customers prefer offerings with sp
eeds of over 35 Mbit.
In 2020, we introduced our new fib -
er customers to Wi-Fi 6 technology, ena
bling them to experience fib -
er speed at home more effectively. T
hrough this technology we provide 
up to 40% speed improvement and much better home coverage. We continue to develop technologies that meet increasing demand from our customers in the pandemic envi -

graduate and doctorate programs, designed to improve the technical knowledge base of our employees in accordance with the quali/f.altications required by our sector, are ongoing since 2014 with a rapidly growing curriculum.
In the meantime, in 
accordance with our vision of leading the production of new technologies, we contributed to the expansion of technology studies by issuing 23 academic and 95 technical publications on national and international platforms in 2020. Digital services and solutions
While our digital services and solu -
tions offer our users a richer value 
proposition, we also work on devel-oping our solutions to cover all user needs. Leveraging the power of tech -
nology and communication, we have maintained our tradition over the past 27 years of facilitating people’s lives and achieving /f.altirsts, by conduct -
ing projects be/f.altitting the title of the world’s /f.altirst digital operator. We not only offer communication services, but also produce and develop digital services. The telecommunication sec -
tor is no longer limited to voice and SMS services. Based on this strategy, we have developed numerous digital services domestically thanks to the more than 1,000 engineers working for our Company. Establishing sep -
arate companies for some of these services, we have taken an important step towards their global competitive positioning. BiP, lifebox, TV + and /f.altizy brands, which aim to stand out in the global competitive arena, are now positioned as separate companies. As part of this structure, these brands conduct their activities faster, strong -
er, and with greater focus within their own organizational structures.
In 2020, we increased 
our digital services standalone revenues by 26%.
We continue to lead the digital trans -
formation demanded by society 
through dozens of services includ -
ing video conferencing, e-mail ser -
vices, instant messaging, TV, digital broadcasting, cloud storage, digital authentication and music platform, which have been developed by Turk -
ish engineers and software develop-ers. To make this digital transforma -
tion accessible, we use our advanced analytical capabilities, and position the right service for the right cus -
tomer, thereby enhancing customer experience. Furthermore, develop-ing these services and solutions, we aim to contribute to the production of domestic technologies, and to support the national economy with self-suf/f.alticient technology solutions. Meanwhile, we design global brands and technologies, which we digitally export to the world. We consider it our primary goal to make a positive contribution to the national econo -
my and reputation of our country by creating economic value through na -

Value Created through Use of Open-Source Coding
As Turkcell, the use of open-
source software is a signif -
icant topic for us both from a user and developer perspec -
tive. Open-source software is utilized to solve various prob -
lems in software architecture. We prefer using open-source software as the building block of high-volume infrastructure applications such as ONEDESK, ULTIA, ONENT, YAP, PARS, which have been developed under the Turkcell GENS directorate. In this respect, in addition to creating value in terms of license man -
agement and cost initiatives, we support the future of the software world contributing to the development of high-quali -
ty secure software without any provider restrictions.Beehive – Turkey’scrowd funding platformThe Beehive platform, enabling en -
trepreneurs to receive necessary re -
sources from society to implement their technology and innovation-ori -
ented projects, provides various ad -
vantages in terms of crowd funding.  Beehive enables project owners to secure the /f.altinancial resources they need to launch their products via the support of individuals across socie -
ty, in large and small amounts, rather than relying on a speci/f.altic person or institution. Over 7 thousand project applications have been submitted to Beehive to date. 40 out of 73 selected projects have successful -
ly completed their campaigns with funds reaching around TRY7.5 mil-lion. Initiatives that have successfully attracted funds and started mass production have already begun to make a difference in the world.

bles enterprises to reduce their costs and grow their revenues.In accordance with our vision, we have implemented approximate -
ly 1,500 tailormade projects to date, which we continue to manage. As part of these efforts, we analyze the needs of customers across every sec -

agement team, we deliver several solutions and services across diverse /f.altields including /f.altixed access, network, cyber security, data center and cloud services, managed services, digital transformation, IoT, big data, business applications and so on. We imple -
ment the most effective solution in accordance with the speci/f.altic business processes of our customers. In imple -
menting our projects, we bene/f.altit both from our internal resources, products, processes and technologies, and the strength of our business partners in the ecosystem that we have identi-/f.altied as the most competent in their /f.altield, managing projects of high value proposition from end-to-end.In order to facilitate the digital trans -

AI based recommendation engineWe make use of the recommenda -
tion engine infrastructure developed by Turkcell engineers to increase the customer’s personalized user experience of our applications and communication channels. Current-ly, we personalize content such as suggestions, product similarities and personalized product lists in /f.altizy, TV+ and Dergilik applications with arti/f.alti -
cial intelligence support. Behind the recommendation engine is a very powerful and large data infrastruc-ture, comprising a cluster of servers, which process over 200 million items of data per day.
This large volume of 
data is processed by choosing the most appropriate algorithms speci/f.altic to the subject/problem such as machine learning, deep learning, and collaborative /f.altiltering, and regularly feeds relevant applications at integration points.
We carry out activities on the na -
tional and international fronts to 
develop measures that help identify threats, and that reduce and elimi -
nate the effects of possible attacks and incidents, and to share those measures with identi/f.altied bodies. As part of these activities, we operate information security management systems under the supervision of our senior management that ensure the security of information in accord-ance with business requirements, laws and legal regulations. In 2008, we became the /f.altirst telecommuni -
cation operator in Turkey to receive ISO 27001 Information Security and Management System certi/f.altication. We retain our certi/f.altication by con -
stantly improving our information 
security practices and by being au -
dited annually by independent audi -
tors.
Cyber security plays an important 
role both in conducting our inter -
nal activities and in the provision of products and services to our cus -
tomers. The Turkcell Cyber Security team has a competent staff of over 130 engineers, and these specialized experts work tirelessly for the sys -
tems security of both Turkcell and our customers. Our Cyber Security Center monitors our customers’ in -
frastructures 24/7, taking measures against possible threats. Within the scope of digital busi-
ness services, in addition to the cyber security services we offer to our corporate customers, we also develop products for our individ -
ual customers. The digital security service blocks users from access -
ing malicious addresses to protect them against cyber threats such as phishing and malware, informs them of past password leaks, and warns them in case of new password sei -
zure attempts via SMS and e-mail. All mobile customers can use this service to avoid fraud, or to protect their device and personal data. Our digital security service has over 10 thousand active customers.

While maintaining our position as the communication and tech -
nology leader, we managed our s
ocial values and relationships, 
which we view as being among the main considerations during the pandemic worldwide. In light of our Life’s at Home motto, we have demonstrated to our cus -
tomers and employees that we o
ffer technologies that uninter -
ruptedly continue education and w
ork from home, while support -
ing our ecosystem. We worked t
owards the goal of having hap -
pier and more loyal customers wi
th our interactive events and 
sponsorship activities. During the early days of the pandemic, our CEO Murat Erkan joined over 5 thousand Turkcell employees in live broadcasts on Pikcell. We conducted the COVID-19 Virtual Work Assessment Survey to un -
derstand our employees’ needs at the s
tart of the pandemic. 
In light of employee feedback gathered by these surveys, we swiftly developed our processes and principles. We conducted comparative surveys to measure the productivity and experienc -
es of our employees in this pro -
cess and implemented different w
orking models (such as work -
ing from home, mobile working) and w
e conducted focus group 
studies on further improvement areas. We enabled employee feedback concerning both their physical and mental health, and took action accordingly during the pandemic and period of re -
mote working through the “How ar
e you Turkcell?” project. We 
called all our employees and business partners who were physically or mentally unwell, lending our support and inquiring into their condition. We organ -
ized social events such as fitness pr
ograms, sports team activi -
ties, online workshops, e-games t
ournaments, Lucky One Knows 
competitions and Coffee Break, in which all our employees could participate online. In addition to these, we continued to strength -

plications such as Instant Awards and 
CXO Awards. Moreover, we 
made the working from home period more comfortable and easier for our employees by or -
ganizing special campaigns us -
ing Turkcell’s internet and digital appl
ication services.
Meanwhile, we stood by our customers during the pandem -
ic period. We implemented a supp

focused on managing the im -
pacts of the crisis with our pub-
lic sector business partners, the 
Minis
try of National Education, 
and the Ministry of Health, as well as with those from the civil society. We doubled the monthly internet quota to 6 GB for ‘teach -
ers and students’ using the EBA in
frastructure. To support health -
care professionals working with gr
eat devotion for our health, 
we gifted additional data and voice packages. Furthermore, we have supported the stay at home movement, a key one of the most necessary means of beating the virus, by changing the network text on our customers’ phones to “lifesathome”. In this process, we constantly informed our cus -
tomers through our social media ac
counts, sharing information 
on the current situation for their greater convenience. Meanwhile, with the #lifesathome concerts, we united Turkey’s beloved artists with their fans. For moral support, we put 11 performances with 8 million interactions into service, which can be viewed again on TV+ and fizy. As of September, we started to transform income generated by the recycling of electronic waste collected from the public at Turkcell stores into educational scholarships for the children of our health heroes who lost their lives to the pandemic, as part of our Recycle for Education project. We believe that what the pandemic has reminded us of the most is the need to work together for a “better world”. With this in mind, we started the “A Better World” internal initiative. Through all these practices, we aim to enhance sustainability, the focus of our business model, in the eyes of our employees, and in social values and relations.

We lead our country’s 
technological development with our vigorous brand, strong infrastructure, superior analytical capabilities, and quali/f.altied human resources. 
We empower individuals and 
organizations, making life easier, fun, and secure for them with our customer-oriented approach, superior analytical capabilities, and innovative digital products and services. We continue to differentiate the customer experience with offers tailored to the needs of each segment. Thanks to our strong infrastructure, we continue to meet the communication needs of our country at high speed and without interruption. Our corporate business is always supportive of the leading companies of Turkey and SMEs alike. We increase our contribution to the Turkish economy by being their business partner. The social responsibility projects we have implemented help us attain the goal of becoming a stronger society by promoting equality in all areas, and the unity of our country.Turkcell in communication
  
Despite the challenging conditions of 2020, it has been a year in which we both consolidated Turkcell’s leader -
ship in network capacity and made a difference with our compassionate and attentive communication ap-proach, by prioritizing customer need during the challenging pandemic pe -
riod. 
As a Company that re/f.altlects social 
consciousness to its communications, we began 2020 with the movie “Kad -
er” highlighting the importance of equal opportunity. 
While ful/f.altilling its corporate social 
responsibility mission of raising mo-rale under pandemic conditions, our commercial, “Be Patient” became one of the most successful of the period. With it, we aimed to make everyone who had to stay home feel that we were right there with them under all conditions, and that these dif/f.alticult days would eventually pass. We did this as a brand with the long-estab -
lished mission of connecting people to life under the motto of “Connect to Life”. 
We conducted our “So Attractive” 
communications throughout the year to underline the urgency of connec -
tion quality and to highlight our supe -
riority in this regard, with emotionally themed advertisements at the fore-front. As Turkcell, we continue to work towards goals such as internet speed through the strength of our high network capacity, while being the best operator. We reached 58 mil -
lion people with 98% integrated ac-cess through our commercial /f.altilm, in which we showcased national gems ranging from Ordu to İzmir, and from Ağrı to Urfa, as well as our coverage quality. Our So Attractive (Çok Çekici) campaign has been among the most appreciated commercials with a 41 AHI score, becoming the most pop -
ular and recalled commercial in July and August according to Adwatch results.
We also launched İşTurkcell to posi -
tion our corporate marketing busi -
ness as part of segment communica -
tion for addressing the technological 
needs of our corporate customers under “Business at Technology, Tech -
nology at Turkcell” motto. Through the new communication platform under the İşTurkcell brand, which offers our products to customers ranging from tradesmen to SMEs and corporates, we conveyed the message that our customers need only consult Turkcell for technological products and solu -
tions without turning elsewhere.Employee relations
We determine improvement actions by listening to the expectations, re -
quests, and complaints of our em -
ployees through periodically con-ducted Employee Engagement Sur-vey and Pulse questionnaires.
We undertake the use of various 
communication channels to better understand the needs of our em -
ployees. In this context, we organ-ize workshops and regular informa-tion sessions with the communities formed by our colleagues across di -
verse functions and tasks. Believing in the power of instant communication, we manage our intra-company com -
munication processes interactively on the BiP groups we have created for our employees, and work towards a timely response to their needs. 
We launched the HR Volunteers plat -
form in 2020 with the voluntary par -
ticipation of 101 employees from all 
functions within Turkcell. Regardless of their roles within the organization, we aim for our employees, who have the power to in/f.altluence and drive change, to become change ambas -
sadors. These, as our HR Volunteers, will add value to the development of human resources processes, practic -
es and products, acting as catalysts within the organization by enriching the employee experience. With our YUPO initiative, we run support pro-grams for our employees identi/f.altied as being of high potential. We aim to support our employees’ career devel -
opment through our committee and Performance Coaches, established to support the performance period pro -
cess and monitor performance eval-uation stages from a function-based perspective. Through the DOX (Digi -
tal Of/f.altice Experience) Digital Of/f.altice Committee and the DOX Subcom -
mittee, we will operate our decision making process with common pur -
pose to meet the needs of all our functions during the pandemic with-in the scope of “Alternative Working Models in the New Working Culture”, which we plan to implement in 2021.
We secure the working rights of 
the productive Turkcell family with our policies that operate within the framework of decent work practices. 
As part of Turkcell 
Human Rights Policy, Human Resources Policy and equal opportunity applications, we continue to connect millions of people to life daily with the best services and products, with the support of our productive Turkcell family and as members of the best teams at Turkey’s digital operator.

Our sales channel structure
We bring our customers all the ad -
vantages, tariffs, devices, products, and s
ervices that Turkey’s leader 
communication and technology com -
pany offers. We continue to develop s
olutions and provide customer-focu -
sed services through Turkcell stores, a
lternative sales channels, the online 
channel, the Digital Operator appli -
cation, Fiber and DSL solution centers and c
orporate sales channels.
Our retail channelAt our retail channel, we continue to provide Turkcell quality services at around 1,300 Turkcell stores, whose digital transformation was comple -
ted in 2018, and at 4,408 digital sales p
oints.
As a company that 
pioneered the digital transformation of Turkey, we now have a new generation store concept where physical contact points are minimized.Our alternative sales channel
As part of our alternative sales chan -
nel that has reached a sales volume o
f 26.8 million products, we trans -
formed each channel reaching the cus
tomer into a sales channel, while 
continuing to serve through Hyper -
markets, Bank Channels, Chains and T
elesales. Our Telesales channel has 
also become the major sales chan -
nel for our digital services with 2.5 mi
llion sales of TV+, lifebox and fizy 
products, making use of big data, our analytical models and artificial intelligence. With TV+, lifebox, and fizy collaborations with banks, we ensured the brand recognition of our DSS products and increased our sales by directing customers to our digital channels. In Bank and Market chan -
nels, we achieved a sales increase of up t
o 46% by offering TRY/package 
products to customers seeking ac -
cess to this service from their homes due t
o the pandemic.
Digital sales channels and servicesAs part of the digitalization focus, our online sales channel has also taken steps to shape Turkey’s e-commerce sector in 2020. While the number of visitors to digital sales channels reac -
hed 30 million per month in 2020, the 3-mon
th active users of Digital Ope -
rator application was 23 million. To-
day, the digital channel share in total 
r
etail device sales revenue has incre -
ased 3.6 times compared to the pre -
vious year, while total TRY/package do
wnloads had a threefold increase. 
In this context, the share of digital sales channels in Turkcell Turkey con -
sumer revenues (excluding our fixed b
usiness) reached 14.3% in fourth qu -
arter of 2020.
In line with our channel 
growth strategy, we shaped our investments with a focus on communication, traffic, sales, delivery, and loyalty. We implemented various technical 
improvements to enhance the pro -
cesses by working with Turkcell’s pro-
fessional ICT team. Under our Artifici -
al Intelligence and Data Analytics te -
ams’ leadership, we implemented our 
s
ales setups, where we emphasized 
the importance of personalization. We have adopted a creative, friendly, value-oriented, and familiar approa -
ch to communication. We maintained o
ur focus on hourly and nighttime 
campaigns to encourage our cus -
tomers to spend more time on turk -
cell.com.tr. Our campaign called the “T
hose who can’t Sleep Club”, active 
between 22.00 and 02.00 during the night, was the bronze prize winner in the Direct Response/Lead Generati -
on category of MIXX Awards Europe 2020
, organized by IAB Europe. “Tho -
se who can’t Sleep Club“ will continue t
o bring our customers brand-new 
concepts with a focus on the right time and right product at the right price. For our customers who look for more internet and more advantage -
ous prices, we have begun to design c
ampaign formats for both postpaid 
and prepaid Turkcell products, as well as for new customer registration and customer number portability catego -
ries. 
W
hile increasing our recognition 
with the use of accurate and tar -
geted media, we sought to create 
the 
perception of turkcell.com.tr as 
offering a wide range of affordable products with a quality experience. We boosted new customer traffic on the website with our strategic cam -
paigns. Focusing on an uninterrupted and e
xcellent customer experience, 
we listened to customer requests and complaints on social media; we prepared campaigns that reflected their wishes; we popped up on both product detail pages and basket pa -
ges with complementary product sugge
stions. We created alternative 
payment methods for purchases and provided delivery within 24 hours. By providing differentiated subscription services, we facilitated the applica -
tion process and better served our cus
tomers, delivering their sim cards 
to their homes.Digitalized experience   
wi
th contactless store
During the COVID-19 period, we implemented the “Contactless Shopping” concept as of Octo -
ber to protect the health of our cus
tomers and employees, and 
to minimize physical contact. Now, our customers will be able to check the offers, device spec -
ifications and award winning game
s at our stores by scanning 
the QR codes using their own smartphones.Digital SignatureAs of May 2018, we completed the digital signature transforma -
tion of all our stores (TİM/DSN/D
SN+) for individual mobile tran -
sactions. As of September 2020, w
e completed the digital signa -
ture transformation of all our in -
dividual fixed customers at Fiber Solution C
enters and DSL Soluti -
on Center Business partnerships. A
ccordingly, the digital signatu -
re usage rate of our individual fix
ed customers soared by 98%. 
As a result, while reducing our costs on such items as archives, documents, and cargo, we also enabled more secure, faster, and easier transactions for our custo -
mers.We launched a new era in device sales. We began to provide con -
tracted offers and made Finan -
cell credits available to our pre -
paid customers who were previ -
ously only able to purchase de-
vices in cash. Thus, we offer our 
pr
epaid customers the opportu -
nity to purchase a device with a c
ontract, or an upfront contract 
without switching to postpaid.We offer our devices, tariffs and digi -
tal service products in a clear, conven -
ient, and visually enriched manner with “GO” that d
igitalizes sales conversa -
tions between employees and custom -
ers as links in the digitalization chain. In add
ition to the benefits we provide 
to our customers; we increase employ -
ee engagement and motivation with sp
ecial awards. In 2020, we enriched 
the TRY/package top up and bill pay -
ment experience by implementing the “GO C
ash” application at the payment 
point, where customer traffic is heavy. We added value to our service model with the ability to offer our customers instant personalized offers, increas -
ing our sales force, and continuing to r
aise customer satisfaction through 
improved experience with “GO Cash”. 
In our supply chain model, we acceler -
ated the product order processes of our 
de
alers with Turkcell Portal. We trans -
formed from a B2B portal operating wi
th limited products and categories 
into a “Digital B2B Procurement Plat -
form” that can supply a wide range of pr
oducts and categories from multiple 
channels with a multi-vendor structure. We continue to provide customized guidance to our dealers according to their orders and sales. We accelerated our processes and enhanced the expe -
rience by establishing a “Content Man -
agement Team”. Currently, we offer 24 tho
usand products of 260 brands 
through 110 suppliers via Turkcell Por -
tal. To make the customer purchasing e
xperience contactless, easy, and fast, 
we implemented the “Reflect to my Bill” application. Today we ensure that the amount of the purchased product is reflected to the customer’s bill via Paycell. Thanks to “Pay by Bill”, which can be used not only for one product, but for the payment of the entire bas -
ket, our customers can now purchase pr
oducts using only their smartphones 
without signing any documents.
We also began to provide servic -
es for new customer registration and 
cus
tomer number porting activation 
transactions, by extending the scope of the “Bi tıkla Mağazada (At the Store with a Click)” application launched in 2019 and used in the delivery process for devices purchased through tele sales channels in the physical chan -
nel. Our customers can conveniently pick up the pr
oducts that they reserve 
on turkcell.com.tr or through tele sales channels at Turkcell stores in their pre -
ferred locations. For a unique and unin-
terrupted Turkcell experience, we give 
o
ur customers the option to choose 
the channel.
Collaborating with Turkey’s largest and most reliable suppliers, Turkcell initiated this journey with the goal of providing “secure online shopping”. Thousands of products from smartp -
hones to vacuum cleaners, and from hobb
y products to computers, are 
available on Turkey’s first electronic marketplace platform “Turkcell Pa -
saj”. Providing users fast delivery and fle
xible payment options, Turkcell Pa -
saj also offers easy cancellation and r
efund options. 
Discount options that fit all comers are offered on “Turkcell Pasaj”. The customers of all operators can also enjoy those. “Turkcell Pasaj” custo -
mers will soon be able to pick up their
 products purchased on the plat -
form around 1,300 Turkcell stores ac -
ross Turkey. Thus, a real online/offline shopping e
xperience will be introdu -
ced on “Turkcell Pasaj”.Our next move to expand our di-
gital sales channels, Turkcell Pasaj, 
has b
een launched in December 
2020. Turkcell, the world’s first di -
gital operator, takes its place in the r
apidly growing e-commerce 
market in the field of consumer electronics. Within the scope of Turkcell digital sales, we introdu -
ced our marketplace platform, T
urkcell Pasaj, on which diverse 
customers and suppliers will be able to buy and sell products in the electronic products category under www.turkcell.com.tr.  In the 
future, it will be possible to sell electronic products to Turkcell and even other suppliers via this channel. Our social values and relations188 189

The need for internet speed, being the 
most critical component of household internet for our customers, has gained in significance during the pandemic. We continued to meet our customer’ needs with Superbox, which offers a unique customer experience with easy installation, portability, and fast internet. As part of Turkcell Fiber, we provided high speed and campaign diversity to meet the needs of our customers, who have experienced its unique speed, during the pandemic period.Turkcell Fiber Speed FestivalGiven the rising need for household internet speed, especially during the pandemic, we launched a Speed Festival at Turkcell Fiber to bring the speed and quality of Turkcell Fiber to even more households. We focused on meeting customer needs with high speed and diversified campaigns. We began to offer our customers 200 Mbps speed for the first time at the retail level. Our customers using inter -

reflecting them on the bill, to purchase additional packages exclusive to their corporate lines with their individual credit cards. We introduced Flexible Packages for those customers who use data lines and cannot use up their internet,  allowing them to use the GBs they purchased on their smartphones. Hence, they were able to use a single internet package on two devices. We have introduced advantageous Hot -

During the COVID-19 period, we have 
developed two new games within the application to offer innovations to our young people. We achieved a 30% rise in application usage thanks to the high interest shown by our young customers in Blast and GNÇ Trivia. We will continue to invest in the GNÇ Mini Games platform by adding new games to those GNÇ games already played by 4 million young people on 17 million occasions in 2020, further in -
troducing our innovations to our youth.
T

thon competition for the second time this y
ear, awarding the winners. This 
year with 3,600 ideas, the number of applications to the competition has doubled from last year.

start of the year. Through another 
development, we allowed customers to view all the packages exclusive to them in a single space under the fast transaction menu by querying the number. Furthermore, we activated our prepaid packages that can be offered as gift. Duly, our customers are able to purchase communica -

Shake and Win once again made a difference in 2020 through its innovations
While Turkcell customers could choose the gifts that best fit their needs among the rich gift options of Turkcell’s most popular promotional campaign, Shake and Win, they had the flexibility to use their gifts when -
ever they wanted. With the “Shake and W

We shared over 60 million gifts with our customers every month. To max -

As the Turkcell family, we strive to make our customers feel “Safe, Valuable, Happy” in every decision we make and with every product or service we design, and we aim to provide our customers with an “easy, personalized and consistent” experience. The customer-oriented cultural transformation we initiated in 2019 is at the heart of every decision taken by all Turkcell employees with the “being here for my customer” mindset. We pay attention to our customers’ needs and demands with our people-oriented communication, reflective of our adopted mission. Primarily, we design our products and services so as to create value for people, making them accessible for all to help eliminate social inequalities. We consider our high customer satisfaction a crucial metric of our success.Our customer relations
and that offer solutions to important 
issues of interest. With the renewed Bizce, we offer brand-new features and content to meet the changing needs of women. Women also sold their handcrafted products at 16 thousand stores in Our Market plat -
form. In addition to the high quality of the handcr
afted products,  the safe 
home delivery option has stood out as the key feature of the application, especially during the pandemic. We hosted experts in the Expert category, where many questions uppermost in women’s minds from health to cuisine are answered with videos that were viewed around 200 thousand times. With the Collect Coupons Campaign, we distributed 350 thousand gifts daily to our users of the application, who collected 10.6 million coupons. We offered advantages with our sur -
prise draws and brand privileges. Our as
trology feature was used around 
500 thousand times. With our brand-new Share Discount feature, our us -

a wide range of topics, such as the inspiring stories of women entrepre -
neurs, business planning, and working p
arents on the Bizce app under the 
Get Inspired and Self Development categories.
With a focus on growth in new post -

c
ontinued to offer our customers inno -
vative offers of rich content, consist-

eater performance in the Mobile 
Number Portability (MNP) market compared to 2019.
 In 
2020, we start -
ed to offer content-rich packages to o
ur new prepaid customers. With the 
normalization process, we increased the revenue contribution of our new prepaid customers by boosting our share in the number porting market and packaging rate. 
With a “Single Turkcell” approach, 
we prioritize an “Omnichannel Ex -

In managing our purchasing process -
es, we adopt cost analysis and dy -
namic working principles. 
When assessing 
purchasing processes, we prioritize those practices that allow us to save on costs and use the integrating power of technology.Supplier Oriented Innovation Projects
The Supplier Oriented Innovation (SOI) is a program encouraging suppliers to leverage their innovative potential for company benefit. Turkcell currently works with 1,500 suppliers and has a total of 5 thousand suppliers managed within its ecosystem. These suppliers serving Turkcell also provide similar services to many different companies on a local and global scale. Suppliers can be informed firsthand of any in -
novative development in their field of w
ork at the companies they serve. 
At the same time, suppliers are able to notice the differences in business practice among different companies to which they provide the same ser -
vice, and thus assess the efficiencies as w
ell as inefficiencies regarding that 
business. The SOI program aims at being informed of global innovations in those fields in which we work with suppliers, and to evaluate the potential for suppliers to access innovations.
To encourage 
innovation, additional rights and advantages are given to suppliers and our employees who work in innovative project teams. The projects were evaluated by the Committees established at the Vice-Presidential level. A total of 47 ideas had been submitted by the end of 2020. Seven ideas were brought to the committee, 6 of which were implemented.

tracting Global Investment to Turkey, the ac
tivities of the Trade Attaché, 
and all Intra-Company Stakeholder Coordination activities. Localization efforts are critical for Turkcell, being directly related to our relations with the Local Ecosystem and the ICTA. In April 2020, we began to work on the “Turkcell Localization Program” aimed at running and following-up processes under a single roof, with the direct guidance of our Chairman and the CEO. The main categories to be followed in the short, medium and long-term have been designated, with localization potential noted at meetings held at senior management level. The studies carried out on the design of localization methodologies for these categories involve expert teams considering both demand and purchasing aspects.
Our localization 
framework ensures that purchased products are produced in Turkey and purchased services are delivered by a local workforce. The localization rate of our main suppliers, which corresponds to approximately 90% of our total purchase volume, has been realized at 36.1% in 2020.The interactions of our 
social values and relations 
with other capitals
Our social values that shape the 
way we do business and our 
relationships with our stakeholders 
are among our most significant 
capitals that guide all other capital 
components and contribute to 
the strong Turkcell image. Our 
social values and relations reflect 
in our communications, which 
increases Turkcell’s brand value 
and reputation. Accordingly, we 
realize the vision and mission 
underpinning our various capitals 
through our statements such 
as “Turkey’s data should remain 
in Turkey”, “Turkey’s robust 
infrastructure”, and “Mobile internet 
at Fiber Speed”. We support our 
robust financial capital through 
high customer satisfaction and 
loyalty. And with the awareness 
of being a good corporate citizen, 
our solid relations with employees, 
the public, our suppliers and our 
society form the cornerstone of 
our Turkcell identity, which creates 
value for the long run.In 2020, we updated our standard 
purchasing processes to support startup companies. Our Domestic and National Industrial Relations team visited techno parks, pro -
moted our new purchasing model and enc
ouraged the ecosystem to 
participate in the processes. As of the end of November 2020, with the My Great Partner Pro -
gram we have generated a pur -
chase volume of TRY14.7 million wi
th 30 companies affiliated to 17 
techno parks across 10 provinces.SDG 9.B

 APPENDICESWe plan the use of 
our natural capital by considering the balance of the natural ecosystem and the needs of future generations, aiming at the effective management of our environmental performance. We take various initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of our operational activities while improving our business processes in accordance with sustainable innovation principles. We include our employees and their families, suppliers, investors, and customers in this process.In 2020, our Company organized 
competitions with awards for en -
vironmental friendliness among its emplo
yees in light of sustainabili -
ty improvements in current business pr
actices. In addition, a business unit 
focused on sustainability was estab -
lished with KPIs related to corporate sus
tainability assigned to its employ -
ees. In 2021, a target including ESG issue
s was added to our Company’s 
business goals, and a methodology was created using ESG parameters to assess employee performance.
While Turkcell reports processes of 
environmental impact, it includes those elements of indirect environ -
mental impact in various reports (ISO 14064 Gr
eenhouse Gas Calculation 
and Verification Management Sys -
tem - CDP Climate Change Reporting e
tc.). It develops projects and good 
practices for those indirect impacts. It has developed various projects re -
lated to customers’ electronic waste, or
 employee waste. In 2021 it has for -
mulated plans to report the emission i
tems not reported within Scope 3 
emissions in the upcoming periods. 
Turkcell purchased carbon credits to 
offset carbon emissions caused by the printing of the 2020 integrated annual report. Details of the offsetting process can be followed using the QR code on the back cover of our report.
Climate crisis management 
Emissions managementIn order to manage the climate crisis effectively, the monitoring and report -
ing of our greenhouse gas emissions gener
ated as a result of our activities 
are among our main environmental priorities. In this regard, as the first mobile operator in Turkey we fulfill our responsibilities with ISO 14064-1 Corporate Greenhouse Gas Emis -
sions Calculation and Reporting Cer -
tification. We monitor our Scope 1, Sc
ope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas 
emissions resulting from our activities through calculations made using the IPCC Tier 1 and Tier 2 (electricity) ap -
proach, covering CO
2, CH4, N2O and 
HFC gases. In our ISO 14064 Calcu -
lation and Reporting of Greenhouse G
as Emissions audits, we include the 
use of personnel shuttles within the scope of our direct and indirect en -
ergy consumption and other indirect emissions
, as well as waste gener -
ated, transmission and distribution lo
sses in the electricity network, our 
logistics operations, and emissions arising from the production of energy that we consume.
As the first mobile operator to hold 
ISO 50001 and ISO 14064 certifica -
tion, we strive to have all ESG pro -
cesses verified by independent third p
arties.
Regarding the reporting of our emis -
sions, we receive external audits in e
very reporting period from an inde -
pendent party for our Scope 1, 2 and 3 gr
eenhouse gas emissions as per 
ISO 14064 requirements. In addition, since 2014 we have annually reported our emissions transparently through the CDP Climate Change Program to meet the information requirements of our stakeholders. Our base year for greenhouse gas emission calcu -
lation is determined as 2016 in terms o
f data integrity and consistency of 
scope. It is determined that 2016 was the most appropriate year for Turkcell, where direct and indirect emissions are comprehensively monitored, and where data is compliant with the re -
quirements and completeness princi -
ple. There is no activity related to the b
urning of biomass within our opera -
tional boundary.
  * Our refrigerant types are R410A, R134A, R22 and R407C.

COVID-19 note
With the spread of the CO -
VID-19 pandemic, the Turkcell f
amily switched to a remote 
working model. Subsequently, we observed that this model had various impacts on ener -
gy use both in the short- and long-t
erm. Although the long-
term effects of remote wor -
king on energy use and carbon emissions ar
e still uncerta -
in, during this period we had the 
opportunity to reduce our 
emissions as energy consump -
tion in our offices declined and o
ur business travels were limi -
ted in scope. The rising use of onl
ine platforms that we have 
developed, such as Paycell, has enabled significant savings in resource consumption.Our business model and sustainability strategy aim to transform our use of natural resources into social and eco -
nomic value, prioritizing the manage -
ment of environmental impacts during this tr
ansformation. We focus on un -
derstanding, managing, and reducing o
ur impacts, aware of the close re -
lationship between our business and natur
al capital. As Turkcell, we strive 
for the sustainable management of our operations, increasing efficien -
cy and maximizing the value gained f
rom our natural capital. We comply 
with national environmental regula -
tions. In 2020, there were no filings aga
inst Turkcell by regulatory and su -
pervisory bodies with respect to leg -
islative misconducts, or complaints in r
elation to environmental issues.

sideration. Re/f.altlecting our recently set goal of becoming a carbon neutral company by 2050, we determine car-bon price based on offers collected from our solution partners in the mar -
ket to offset the emissions from our operations. The unit price of carbon varies between EUR0.5 and EUR1 per ton.  In the upcoming periods, we plan to create an internal carbon pricing plan to offset some of our Scope 3 emissions. Within the scope of this plan, we aim to offset carbon in areas such as business travel and corporate communication events. Meanwhile, we aim to raise employee awareness of the impact of our activities, and ex -
pect it to trigger behavioral change.
Water management We attach importance to responsible water consumption within the scope of our activities, with water being among the most vital natural resourc -
es. As part of our exemplary corpo -
rate citizenship approach, we take steps to reduce our water consump -
tion through sustainable water man -
agement, which we hold among our leading environmental responsibilities. 
Although water is not a resource that 
we directly use in developing our products and services, as a responsi -
ble company in terms of resource use, we disclose the amount of water we use through our annual disclosures.
Our water demand arises from the 
daily general water use of our em -
ployees at the locations where we conduct our operations. In our Data Centers, we reuse rainwater as gray water (in toilets and urinals) with var-ious /f.altiltering processes. We continue our efforts to recycle and reuse our wastewater.
Waste management
We manage waste resulting from our operations and activities by selecting appropriate methods and technolo -
gies. Having adopted the approach of generating minimum waste and and maximum recycling, we conduct our processes in full compliance with rele -
vant regulations through our contract -
ed waste management company.
As part of our activities, we integrate 
systems that reduce waste generation and the use of natural resources into our operations. Furthermore, we sort waste, the generation of which we cannot prevent, at its source and im -
plement recycling measures.We develop practices to reduce the consumption of materials such as pa-per and toner in our of/f.altice buildings, and sort all types of waste such as paper, plastic, and domestic waste at their source. We send sorted waste to recycling facilities as part of our co -
operation with municipalities and re -
spective authorities.
We collect batteries in waste battery 
containers and deliver them to mu-nicipalities and TAP (Portable Battery Manufacturers and Importers Associ-ation) for recycling.

While we strive to improve the water performance within our operations, we also support our customers in managing their wa -
ter consumption with the solutions we offer. Our Smart Water Meter  
platform solution, which allows meters to be read and valves to be opened/closed remotely lev-eraging IoT technologies, helps control water consumption, en -
abling instant monitoring of wa -
ter use and protection of natural resources. We offer our “Filiz”  
application to farmers in order to protect scarce water resources and support sustainable agricul-tural activities. “Filiz” communi-cates critical information such as plant development, water need and disease risk to farmers, en -
abling them to take necessary measures. “Filiz” collects this in -
formation by monitoring various soil and air parameters through sensors and incorporating them into algorithms created with ar -
ti/f.alticial intelligence. “Filiz” is also 
noteworthy for its ability to reach agricultural engineers through digital channels. Almost half of the farmers in Turkey lack access to technical support. In this re -
gard, we enable access to tech -
nical information for those who need it, through digital channels. Integrating these capabilities with technology, we support sus -
tainable agriculture.

s
olid food waste collected from our 
cafeteria and office floors is recycled by compost machine and turned into organic soil fertilizer.
In order to prevent waste oil from mix -
ing with domestic wastewater, we use oi
l trap systems. We dispose of haz -
ardous waste such as batteries, toner, ele
ctronics, cables, and consumables 
resulting from our operations through licensed recycling companies having the required competency within the regulatory framework. Thus, we pre -
vent hazardous waste from interacting wi
th the environment.
Within the scope of product reuse, we sell secondhand devices as well as other types of scrap to companies using older technologies. We aim to revalue 100% of network infrastructure devices as part of such sales. Hence, we contribute to the circular economy system, which ensures that resources are not redundantly extracted or wast -
ed, but recovered for reuse. As part of the 
Modem Renewal Project launched 
in 2019, we renew or repair modem products no longer used by customers and make them ready for reuse. Within the scope of this project, 152,024 set-top boxes (STB), 63,303 Superbox prod -
ucts, 108,368 optical network terminals (
ONT) and 404,431 modems were re -
newed in 2020. Thirty three percent (
approximately 188 thousand) of the 
fiber modems used (approximately 569 thousand) and 60% (approximate -
ly 154 thousand) of the ADSL modems (
approximately 259 thousand) used 
in 2020 were sourced from modems renewed within the year. In addition, 80% of the renewed STBs, 100% of the ONTs (installed upon determination of the functionality of ONT products) and 60% of the Superboxes were used in the same year and brought into the service of our customers.
We are well aware of the adverse impact of electronic waste on the ecosystem if not properly managed. Hence, we carry out our activities in this field with the utmost care. In or -
der to convert risk into opportunity, we uti
lize products classified as electronic 
waste, yet that include rich raw mate -
rials and materials suitable for reuse, as p
art of circular economy, thereby 
achieving financial savings and effi -

paign in Turkey, in cooperation wi
th “TÜBİSAD (Informatics In -
dustry Association)”. Unused ele
ctronic devices that have 
become waste are collected at Turkcell stores in “electron -
ic waste” boxes. The proceeds deriv
ed from the sale of these 
products were donated to TEGV (Turkey Education Volunteers Foundation) in previous years. Starting with the new school year, we began to donate these proceeds to the children of healthcare professionals, who lost their lives during the pan -
demic, through the KAHEV (Fe -
male Doctors Education Sup -
port Foundation). We recycled ne
arly 6.5 tons of electronic 
waste in 2020.
As part of the project, we also 
recycle the electronic waste of our employees. With this project, we not only aim to contribute to the transformation in education, but also raise awareness of the pollution caused by electronic waste and its potential for re -
cycling. We also continue inten -
sive campaign communications t

ly-friendly and operating a more e
ffective system.
Energy management  
We address our energy management pr
actices from two perspectives; 
the energy we consume as part of our activities and the energy we produce from renewable sources. As part of our mission to ensure opti -
mum use of natural resources, and o
ur environmentally-friendly business 
model based on shaping technology according to social needs, we prior -
itize the use of renewable energy re-
sources. By 2030, we aim to meet all 
o
ur electricity needs from renewable 
resources. As the first mobile opera -
tor in Turkey, having obtained the ISO 5000
1 Energy Management System 
standard, we make use of every op -
portunity to save energy.
W
ith our Turkcell Energy Solutions 
subsidiary established in 2017 as part 
of Turkcell Group, we aim to become a consistent and transparent elec -tricity energy supplier that operates wi
thin the boundaries of private law 
in the competitive environment, in or -
der to supply low cost and environ-
mentally-friendly energy. The value 
that w
e seek to create in this context 
is based on leveraging the increased synergy and activity arising from the provision of energy, energy solu -
tions, and mobile and fixed benefits thr
ough an integrated approach. 
We calculate and monitor our energy performance via an energy intensity performance indicator defined as the ratio of non-renewable energy consumption to net revenue. The Turkcell Energy Density ratio for 2020, including our total energy consump -
tion, is calculated as 76,800 GJ/P
etabyte. The specific measurement 
unit used in the energy intensity cal -
culation is identified as “emission per p
etabyte.”

TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020 TURKCELL  INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020ABOUT TURKCELL VALUE CREATING TURKCELL STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL CAPITAL HUMAN CAPITAL MANUFACTURED CAPITAL INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL NATURAL CAPITAL OUR SOCIAL VALUES AND RELATIONS APPENDICESRenewable energy
As part of our goals of meeting our entire electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2030 and be -
coming a net-zero company by 2050, we pioneer renewable energy invest -
ments by employing the self-con-sumption model in our buildings. We therefore target becoming a compa -
ny that generates its electricity from environmentally-friendly resources.
We plan to meet our 
energy requirements from green energy sources by having power plants of our own and leasing renewable energy generation capacity from power plants in Turkey with a long-term approach. Portable Solar Field solution, which we 
developed to meet communication needs in regions where the popula -
tion increases periodically, but where access to energy resources is limited, is a product of our innovation activ -
ities. These communication stations, installed in various locations across Turkey, stand out for their environ-mentally-friendly nature and contrib -
ute to our sustainability goals. We are proud to share that our investments into renewable energy technologies will continue in the upcoming periods. 
We design our processes to minimize 
the environmental impact not only in our direct operations, but throughout our entire value chain. In accordance with our green procurement practices, we evaluate the compliance of prod -
ucts we use to various environmental criteria such as energy ef/f.alticiency and the sustainability of raw materials, and prioritize the use of products of low greenhouse gas emission.
Turkcell sets short- and long-term 
goals to reduce its negative environ -
mental impact, carrying out reporting and activities accordingly. In 2021, Key Performance Indicators for renewable energy and techno waste have been determined as a business target for the relevant teams. In 2021, prepa -
rations on the compliance process of suppliers with the Environmental and Human Rights Policies published by Turkcell have begun. The compli -
ance of suppliers with Turkcell’s ESG processes has also been assigned to the relevant objectives as business targets.
We carry out energy saving activi -
ties to ensure responsible use of our 
existing energy resources. We attach importance to the energy ef/f.alticien -
cy of our network equipment. We continue to replace air conditioning devices and energy infrastructure in data center system rooms with more ef/f.alticient, state-of-the-art products. In calculating our energy savings, we consider the approximate annual savings of each /f.altield in which saving initiatives are implemented, and cal -
culate annual savings by taking the total number of such /f.altields into ac -
count. And in pursuit of achieving en-ergy savings, we leverage practices such as /f.altields without air condition-ing, ef/f.alticient recti/f.altier technology, pas -
sive cooling, outdoor cabinets, power saving algorithms, renewable energy and GPON technology.As Turkcell Energy Solutions, we ap -
proach energy consumption and generation from an environmentalist perspective by installing solar ener -
gy power plants at our data centers and of/f.altices, and reducing the carbon emission within the self-consump-tion model framework. In 2020, the electricity generated by the self-con -
sumption model reached an amount equivalent to the 1-year electricity consumption of 1,230 households. Furthermore, we stand to encourage environmentalist methods through electricity trade with renewable en -
ergy power plants. We continue our environmentalist approach with our renewable energy supply that is cer -
ti/f.alticated with I-REC in 2020.
Turkcell Energy Solutions, which will 
continue its renewable energy invest -
ments in the coming periods, aims to make Turkcell a company that sup -
plies its electricity from environmen -
tally-friendly sources with zero car -
bon emissions.
With our group’s /f.altirst solar power 
plant, located in the Turkish Repub -
lic of Northern Cyprus, we generate 1.2 million kWh of electricity annual -
ly, preventing emission of 448 t CO
2e 
to the atmosphere. With this plant, we also reduce the demand load on the TRNC Turkish Electricity Authority (KIB-TEK) network and contribute to the digital infrastructure of the elec -
tricity network.
At the Ankara Data Center, the /f.altirst in 
Turkey to generate its own energy via solar panels, we bene/f.altit from solar power through new generation pan -
els installed on top of the building’s parking lot, meeting part of our elec -
tricity demand from renewable sourc-es. We avoided 112.5 t CO
2e GHG of 
emissions via our data center building that generates 300 thousand kWh of electricity a year. In addition, we are proud to be Turkey’s sole company, two data centers of which have ob -
tained Uptime OS Operational Sus-tainability Gold certi/f.altication. There are 64 data centers worldwide and 4 in Turkey that have obtained this certi/f.altication. Our Gebze Data Center was the /f.altirst in Turkey to receive the certi/f.alticate in 2018 followed by our An -
kara Data Center.
We continue to generate electricity 
from renewable resources through a solar energy scheme installed on the roof of the Turkcell Adana Plaza build -
ing. We utilize the energy generated through the self-consumption mod -
el to meet the electricity needs of our Adana Plaza building. We avoid around 26 t CO
2e of greenhouse gas 
emissions annually from a 70 thou -
sand kWh electricity generation ca -
pacity.
We generated 1.6 
million kWh electricity from renewables with 3 solar power projects in 2020. Hence, we met 0.2% of our energy consumption from renewables for the year.

ulations and resolutions of the Capital Markets Board (“CMB”). 
In p
arallel with corporate governance efforts established with the creation of the Investor Relations Department at the time 
of the IPO, and gained momentum in 2003, corporate governance mechanisms are being implemented in line with the cor -
porate governance principles.  T
urkcell İletişim Hizmetleri A.Ş. places a great importance on the full compliance with Corporate Governance Principles. 
In the activity period that ended as of 31 December 2020, as the amendments in the articles of association provided the 
legal ground for the election of independent board members in the following general assembly meetings, our company aims full compliance with the partially complied principle numbered 4.3.7, as mandated in the annexes of the Corporate Govern -
ance Communiqué and in the relevant legislation.

(vii)

tween some principles and the current structure of the Company and the market.

Corporate Governance Compliance Report (“CGCR”) and (ii) the Corporate Governance Fact Sheet (“CGFS”) and (iii) other relevant sections of the annual report as to the corporate governance principles in the annexes of the Communiqué on Cor -
porate Governance with which the compliance is achieved as well as the ones that are not yet complied with. 
T
aking into account the amendments of the regulations and the practices, future efforts will continue to improve our corpo -
rate governance practices including the limited number of unimplemented principles and, to ensure, within the framework 
o
f these principles, the better operation of the mechanisms with respect to the corporate governance practices of the 
partnership.

ment will be included in the interim activity reports.Statement of compliance with corporate

Cost of revenue (excluding the depreciation and amortiza -
tion): Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amorti -
zation) increased to 49.3% (47.9%) as a percentage of reve -
nues. This was due mainly to the rise in cost of goods sold

 despite the decline in cost of revenue of financial 
services (0.5pp) and other cost items (0.4pp) as a percent -
age of revenues.Administrative expenses: Administrative expenses fell to 2.6% (3.1%) as a percentage of revenues, driven mainly by lower office overhead costs and travel expenses.
Selling and marketing expenses: Selling and marketing ex -
penses declined to 4.7% (6.2%) as a percentage of revenues driven 
by the decline in selling expenses (0.8pp), marketing 
expenses (0.5pp) and other cost items (0.2pp) as a percent -

and on April 2, 2019 completed the transfer of its shares in Fintur to Sonera Holding B.V., the majority shareholder of Fintur. The final value of the transaction was EUR352.9 million. As the conditions precedent required for the share transfer were completed within Q119, TRY772 million profit generated from the transaction was reflected in the Q119 financial statements.
Income tax expense: Income tax expense declined 50.7% 
due mainly to lifecell’s deferred tax income. Please note that in Q420 lifecell registered TRY689 million deferred tax in -
come having recognized its accumulated losses as deferred t
ax assets.
Net income: Group net income increased 30.5% to TRY4,237 million (TRY3,246 million). Net income was positively impact -

(1) Superbox subscribers are included in mobile subscribers.
(2) Presentation of churn figures has been changed to demonstrate average monthly churn figures for the respective quarters.   (3) In Q117, our churn policy was revised to extend from 9 months to 12 months (the period at the end of which we disconnect prepaid subscribers who have not topped up above TRY10). Additionally, under our revised policy, prepaid customers who last topped up before March will be disconnected at the latest by year-end. As a regulatory requirement, we started to disconnect prepaid lines in accordance with new ICTA regulation, which requires deactivation of prepaid lines which lack residency documents by the 6th month of subscription starting from 2019. Furthermore, as required by the ICTA, the line of a deceased customer should either be transferred to a successor/another user or terminated. Lines, which are not transferred or terminated, are to be disconnected at the end of seven months.(4) We historically recorded all TV-related revenue under Turkcell Superonline and presented the related ARPU under fixed residential ARPU. As previously announced, our TV business has become a separate standalone subsidiary. In order to reflect this change in our organization, we decided to shift mobile OTT TV ARPU from fixed residential ARPU into mobile ARPU starting from Q320. We note that mobile TV revenues are generated by mobile subscribers. IPTV revenues will continue to be recorded under Turkcell Superonline and included under residential fixed ARPU. In order to maintain comparability, we provide ARPU data for the last three years, revised to reflect this change on our investor relations website in financial and operational data spreadsheet.Total cash & debt: Consolidated cash as of December 31, 
2020 decreased to TRY11,861 million from TRY13,524 million as of September 30, 2020 due mainly to the dividend pay -
ment, and the impact of TRY appreciation on our FX de -
nominated cash. Excluding FX swap transactions, 74% of our c
ash is in US$, 4% in EUR, and 22% in TRY.
Consolidated debt as of December 31, 2020 decreased to TRY21,586 million from TRY22,841 million as of September 30, 2020 due mainly to the impact of TRY appreciation on FX denominated debt. Please note that TRY2,099 million of our consolidated debt is comprised of lease obligations.

 APPENDICESThe number of our subscribers in Turkey grew by 1.1 million 
net annual additions, reaching 36.7 million in FY20 despite the pandemic environment. Accordingly, we achieved our 1 million net subscriber additions target for the year thanks to our solutions that meet changing customer needs, our rich value proposition, and innovative campaigns that facilitate their lives. 
On the mobile front, our subscriber base expanded to 33.4 
million on 712 thousand net annual additions in FY20. Our postpaid subscribers grew on 1.6 million net annual ad -
ditions, the highest of the past 11 years. Accordingly, our p
ostpaid subscribers reached 65.7% (62.2%) of our mobile 
subscriber base as at the end of the year. Meanwhile, our prepaid subscribers declined 892 thousand in FY20, due mainly to the disconnection of 666 thousand inactive pre -
paid subscribers in Q420 in line with our churn policy. There w
ere also 194 thousand disconnections in Q420 to reflect 
the regulatory change requiring deactivation of deceased customers’ subscriptions.
On the fixed front, our subscriber base exceeded 2.4 million 
on 187 thousand net annual additions. Our fiber subscribers grew by 180 thousand annual net additions. Superbox, our fixed-wireless access offering, registered a strong perfor -
mance in FY20. Accordingly, it had 268 thousand net annual add
itions. Meanwhile, our IPTV customer base rose to 871 
thousand on 152 thousand annual net additions. The average monthly mobile churn rate was 2.3% in 2020. The higher mobile churn rate in Q419 was due mainly to the lump sum disconnection of subscriptions in accordance with the ICTA regulation that requires deactivation of pre -
paid lines, that lack residency documents by the 6th month o
f subscription. Average monthly fixed churn rate was at 
1.9% in FY20.
Our mobile ARPU (excluding M2M) 15.0% for the full year on 
the back of a larger postpaid subscriber base and upsell efforts, as well as increased data and digital services usage.
Fiber residential ARPU grew by 9.2% for the full year driven 
mainly by upsell efforts and the acquisition of higher reve -
nue generating customers.
A
verage monthly mobile data usage per user increased 
58.1% for the full year. This was driven mainly by the increas -
ing number and data consumption of 4.5G users, as well as 
hig
her digital services usage. Accordingly, the average mo -
bile data usage of 4.5G users reached 14.9 GB in Q420. The rising numb
er of Superbox subscribers also had a positive 
impact on data consumption. 
The number of 4.5G compatible smartphones on our net -
work rose to 21.5 million on 2.3 million annual additions, 
c
omprising 91% of smartphones on our network. Total 
smartphone penetration had reached 81% as at the end of the year.Please note that this paragraph contains forward looking statements based on our current estimates and expectations regar -

 1. Reporting entity  
Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri Anonim Sirketi (the “Company” or “Turkcell”) was incorporated in Turkey on  
5 October 1993 and commenced its operations in 1994. The address of the Company’s registered office is Maltepe Aydinevler Mahallesi Inonu Caddesi No: 20, Kucukyali Ofispark/Istanbul. It is engaged in 
establishing and operating a Global System for Mobile Communications (“GSM”) network in Turkey and regional states. 
In April 1998, the Company signed a license agreement (the “2G License”) with the Ministry of Transport 
and Infrastructure of Turkey (the “Turkish Ministry”), under which it was granted a 25-year GSM license in 
exchange for a license fee of USD 500,000. The License permits the Company to operate as a stand-alone 
GSM operator and releases it from some of the operating constraints in the Revenue Sharing Agreement, which was in effect prior to the 2G License.
 Under 2G license, the Company pays in cash the Undersecretariat 
of the Treasury (the “Turkish Treasury”) a monthly tax levy, namely a 'treasury share' equal to 15% of the Company's gross revenue from Turkish GSM operations. The Company continues to build and operate its 
GSM network and is authorized to, among other things, set its own tariffs within certain limits, charge peak 
and off-peak rates, offer a variety of service and pricing packages, issue invoices directly to subscribers, collect payments and deal directly with subscribers. Following the 3G tender held by the Information Technologies 
and Communications Authority (“ICTA”) regarding the authorization for providing IMT-2000/UMTS 
services and infrastructure, the Company has been granted the A-Type license (the “3G License”) providing 
the widest frequency band, at a consideration of EUR 358,000 (excluding Value Added Tax (“VAT”)). Payment of the 3G license was made in cash, following the necessary approvals, on 30 April 2009. 
On 26 August 2015, “Authorization Tender on IMT Services and Infrastructure” publicly known as “4.5G 
license” tender, was held by the ICTA and the Company was awarded with a total frequency band of  172.4 MHz for 13 years. The tender price is EUR 1,623,460 (excluding VAT of 18%). IMT authorization 
period expires on 30 April 2029 and operators were able to commence service delivery for 4.5G starting from  
1 April 2016. 2x1.4 MHz frequency band in 900MHz spectrum and 2 units of 2x5 MHz frequency bands in 
2100 MHz spectrum were commenced on 1 December 2015, while remaining packages were commenced on 1 April 2016.  
The Company is obliged to pay the ICTA a monthly treasury share equal to 90% of 15% of gross revenue and 
10% is paid for a universal service fund. In addition, the Company pays annual contributions in an amount equal to 0.35% of net revenue to the ICTA’s expenses and 5% of net revenue to ICTA as a frequency fee 
(TRx). 
On 21 October 2020, the following main amendments to the articles of association have been approved by the 
Ordinary General Assembly:  
(i) The size of the board of directors has been increased from seven members to a total of nine members;

2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies 
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements to the extent they have not already been disclosed in the other notes below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The consolidated financial 
statements are for the Group consisting of the Company and its subsidiaries and the Group’s interest in an 
associate and a joint venture. 
(a) Compliance with IFRS 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRS IC”) applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements comply with IFRS as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(c) Functional and presentation currency  (i) Transactions and balances 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at that date.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are 
translated to the functional currency using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain 
or loss. For example, translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities such as assets held at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation 
differences on assets classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized in other comprehensive income. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss, except: 
 For capitalized foreign exchange differences relating to borrowings to the extent that they are regarded 
as an adjustment to interest costs eligible for capitalization.  
 
Foreign exchange differences are deferred in equity if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying 
net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses are presented in the statement of profit or loss on a net basis within finance income or finance costs.  
(ii) Foreign operations
 
The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
 Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of 
that balance sheet, 
 Equity for each balance sheet presented is translated at historic cost at the date of transaction, 
 Income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive income are translated at average monthly exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses 
are translated at the dates of the transactions) and 
 All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the foreign currency translation reserve, in equity. 
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other financial 
instruments designated as hedges of any net investment in foreign entities are recognized in other 
comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold or any borrowings forming part of the net investment 
are repaid the associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. Independent auditor’s report and

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(d) Use of estimates and judgments 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates. Management 
also needs to exercise judgment in applying the Group’s accounting policies. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Alterations to accounting estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
Information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are described below: 
Allowance for doubtful receivables 
The Group maintains an allowance for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of 
the Group’s subscribers and customers to make required payments. The Group bases the allowance on the 
likelihood of recoverability of trade receivables, receivables from financial services and other receivables; 
when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of asset and that events have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or 
group of financial assets that could be reliably estimated. The allowance is periodically reviewed. The allowance charged to expenses is determined in respect of receivable balances, calculated as a specified 
percentage of the outstanding balance in each aging group, with the percentage of the allowance increasing as the aging of the receivable progresses. 
Capitalization and useful lives of assets 
The useful lives and residual values of the Group’s assets are estimated by management at the time the asset 
is acquired and regularly reviewed for appropriateness. The Group defines useful lives of its assets in terms of 
the assets’ expected utility to the Group. This judgment is based on the experience of the Group with similar 
assets. In determining the useful life of an asset, the Group also follows technical and/or commercial 
obsolescence arising on changes or improvements from a change in the market. The useful lives of the telecommunication licenses are based on the duration of the license agreements. 
Gross versus net presentation of revenue 
When the Group acts as principal in sale of goods or rendering of services, revenue from customers and costs 
with suppliers are reported on a gross basis. When the Group acts as agent in sale of goods or rendering of 
services, revenue from customers and costs related to suppliers are reported on a net basis, representing the net 
margin earned. Whether the Group is acting as principal or agent depends on management’s analysis of both legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgments impact 
the amount of reported revenue and costs but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows. 
Contracted handset sales 
The Company, the distributors and dealers offer joint campaigns to the subscribers which may include the sale 
of device by the dealer and/or distributor and a communication service to be provided by the Company. The 
Company does not recognize any revenue for the device in these transactions by considering the factors below: 
 - the Company is not the primary obligor for the sale of handset, 
 - the Company does not have control over the sale prices of handsets, 
 - the Company has no inventory risk.

Multiple performance obligations and price allocation 
In arrangements which include multiple elements where the Group acts as principal, the Group considers that 
these bundled elements involve consideration in the form of a fixed fee or a fixed fee coupled with a continuing 
payment stream. A good or service is distinct if both of the following criteria are met: 
 The good or service is capable of being distinct,   
 The promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract. 
The arrangement consideration is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on 
relative stand-alone selling prices. If an element of a transaction is not distinct, then it is accounted for as an integral part of the remaining elements of the transaction. 
Income taxes The calculation of income taxes involves a degree of estimation and judgment in respect of certain items whose 
tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, 
as appropriate, through formal legal process. 
As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group is required to estimate the 
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions and countries in which it operates. This process involves estimating 
the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue and reserves for tax and accounting purposes.  
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which unrecognized tax losses and temporary differences can be utilized. Recognition, 
therefore, involves judgment regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity in which the deferred tax asset has been recognized. 
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets 
As detailed and disclosed in Note 38, the Group is involved in a number of investigations and legal proceedings 
(both as a plaintiff and as a defendant) arising in the ordinary course of business. All these investigations and 
litigations are evaluated by the Group Management and disclosed (unless information concerning provisions 
are very sensitive, and full disclosure could prejudice the outcome of cases) or accounted for in the consolidated financial statements. Future results or outcome of these investigations and litigations might differ from these 
Group Management’s expectations. As at the reporting date, the Group Management believes that appropriate 
recognition criteria and measurement basis are applied to provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets and that sufficient information is disclosed in the notes to enable users to understand their nature, timing and amount by considering current conditions and circumstances. 
Annual impairment review  The Group’s non-current are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Independent auditor’s report and

Fair value measurements and valuation process 
Some of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In 
estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 and 2 inputs are not available, the Company can engage third party qualified experts 
to perform the valuation, if necessary. The management works closely with the qualified external experts to 
establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. Information about the valuation 
techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets and liabilities is disclosed in  
Note 36. 
(e) Changes in accounting policies 
Other than the adoption of the new and revised standards as explained in Note 2(z), the Group did not make 
any significant changes to its accounting policies during the current year. 
(f) Changes in accounting estimates 
If the application of changes in the accounting estimates affects the financial results of a specific period, the 
changes in the accounting estimates are applied in that specific period, if they affect the financial results of 
current and following periods; the accounting estimate is applied prospectively in the period in which such 
change is made. A change in the measurement basis applied is a change in an accounting policy, and is not a 
change in an accounting estimate.  
The Company does not have significant changes in accounting estimates during the year. 
(g) Comparative information and revision of prior period financial statements 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared consistent with prior periods. 
(h) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting 
(i) Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a 
business combination comprises: 
 The fair value of the assets transferred, 
 Liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business, 
 Equity interests issued by the Group, 
 The fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, and 
 The fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, 
with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred, amount of any non-controlling interest in 
the acquired entity, and acquisition-date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquired entity 
over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain 
purchase. The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired 
entity’s net identifiable assets.

(i) Business combinations (continued) 
Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted 
to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under 
comparable terms and conditions. 
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial 
liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. 
Contingent consideration classified as equity is not subject to remeasurement.  Instead, any gain or loss at settlement is recorded as an adjustment to equity through other comprehensive income
. 
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or 
losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss. 
(ii) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries comprise all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the 
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 
are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are 
eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group. 
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of financial position, respectively. 
Non-controlling interest has not been attributed to Belarus Telekom on the grounds that net assets of Belarus 
Telekom is negative, Belarus Telekom is financed solely by the Company and management’s assessment of 
relevant articles of the share purchase agreement with the non-controlling shareholder. 
The Group sold six financial loans amounting to TL 439,364 between 2017 and 2019  
to Aktif Yatirim Bankasi A.S. Turkcell Varlik Finansmani Fund (the “Fund”) founded by Aktif Yatirim 
Bankasi A.S. in order to create funds for the issuance of Asset Backed Securities (“ABS”) which were issued 
by the Fund in a structure where Turkcell Finansman A.S. (“Turkcell Finansman”) acted as the source organization. These aforementioned funds are all expired and there are no issued ABS as of  
31 December 2020. Turkcell Finansman transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the 
financial loans that have been sold to the Fund resulting in de-recognition of the related assets from its financial 
statements. Moreover, the Group did not consolidate the Fund since the activities of the Fund are not controlled by the Group and the Fund has been defined as a structured entity.

(h) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting (continued) 
(iii) Changes in ownership interests 
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions 
with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying 
amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to the non-controlling and any consideration paid or received 
is recognized in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners of the Company.  
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint 
control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change 
in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the 
purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. 
In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that 
amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. 
If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence 
is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.  
(iv) Business combinations under common control 
Business combinations between entities or businesses under common control are excluded from the scope of 
IFRS 3. In a business combination under common control, assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are stated 
at predecessor carrying values. Any difference between the consideration given and the aggregate book value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity at the date of the transaction is recognized in equity. The 
acquired entity’s results and financial position are incorporated as if both entities (acquirer and acquiree) had 
always been combined, or using the results from the date when either entity joined the Group, where such a date is later. 
(v) Put option over shares relating to non-controlling interests 
Where a put option is written by the Group on shares in an existing subsidiary held by non-controlling interests, 
the Group recognizes a financial liability at the present value of the redemption amount to reflect the put option. 
If the ownership risks and rewards of the shares relating to the put option is attributable to Group, the non-
controlling interest is derecognized. The difference between the put option liability and the non-controlling 
interests derecognized is recognized in equity. For business combinations after 1 January 2009, subsequent 
changes in the fair value of the put option liability are recognized in profit or loss. 
Reserve for put option over shares relating to non-controlling interests included in equity arises from the 
difference between the fair value of the put option written by Fintur Holdings B.V. (“Fintur”) on non-
controlling shares in one of its subsidiaries and the derecognized non-controlling interests relating to that put 
option.

 (h) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting  (continued)   
 (vi) Investments in associates and joint ventures  
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control. This 
is generally the case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in 
associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting after initially being recognized at cost. 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights 
to the net assets of the joint arrangement.  The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated 
in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.  
Under the equity method of accounting, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other 
comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.  
When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in that entity, 
including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity. 
Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence 
of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
On acquisition of an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair 
values of the associate’s identifiable assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill, which is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate’s 
identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as part of the Group’s share of the associate profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired. 
The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment. The Group measures an 
associate that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount at the date of classification as 
held for sale and fair value less costs of disposal. Equity accounting ceases once an associate is classified as held for sale.  
(i) Financial instruments 
 Classification 
From 1 January 2018, the Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: 
- Those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss) and 
- Those to be measured at amortized cost. 
The classification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual 
terms of the cash flows. 
For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For 
investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). 
The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets 
changes.  Independent auditor’s report and

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(i) Financial instruments (continued)  Recognition and derecognition 
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on trade date, the date on which the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows 
from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership. 
 Measurement 
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset 
not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss. 
Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their 
cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. 
(i) Debt instruments  
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments: 
- Amortized cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent 
solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss.  
- FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where 
the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements 
in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest 
income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit 
or loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest 
rate method.  
- FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or 
loss on a debt instruments that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognized in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

(i) Financial instruments (continued)  Measurement (continued) 
(ii) Equity instruments 
The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management has 
elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. 
Dividends from such investments continue to be recognized in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established. 
Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognized in the statement of profit or loss as 
applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI 
are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. 
 Impairment 
From 1 January 2018, the Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortized cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on 
whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. 
Loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases. 
 12 month expected credit losses (ECLs): these are ECLs that result from possible default events within 
the 12 months after the reporting date and 
 Lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 
The Group applies lifetime ECL measurement for all group companies except Turkcell Finansman which applies both 12 month and lifetime ECL (general approach). 
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position 
where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts, and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. This policy had also been applied before 1 January 2018.  
Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on 
hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions and other short-term, highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course 
of business. If collection of the amounts is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. See Note 36 for a description of the Group’s impairment policies.

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial 
year which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due 
within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognized initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

(a) A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to the Group if that person: 
(i) has control or joint control of the Group (ii) has significant influence over the Group; or 
(iii) is a member of the key management personnel of the Group or of a parent of the Group. 
(b) An entity is related to the Group if any of the following conditions applies: 
(i) The entity and the Group are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary 
and fellow subsidiary is related to the others). 
(ii) One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a

(iii) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party. 
(iv) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity. 
(v) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the Group or

(vi) The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a). 
(vii) A person identified in (a) (i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key 
management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity). 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognized in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent 
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be 
drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates. 
Borrowings are removed from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract 
is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has 
been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets 
transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss.

(i) Financial instruments (continued) 
Derivatives and hedging activities  
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.  
Fair values of foreign exchange forwards, interest rate and foreign exchange swaps (IRS, Cross Currency 
Swaps etc.) and options are calculated with market levels of interest rates and Central Bank of Republic of Turkey (“CBRT”) exchange rates via Bloomberg financial terminal. If market levels are not available for 
valuation date, fair value for forward contracts will be the value of the discounted future value of the difference 
between contract price level and forward value of CBRT exchange rate with risk free rates for the period. Interest rate and currency swaps will be valued with the difference of the discounted cash flows of each leg of 
the swaps using risk free rates and CBRT exchange rates. Option transactions will be valued with option pricing models using risk free rates and CBRT exchange rates.
 
The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives 
as hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognized assets and liabilities and highly 
probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges). 
At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions. 
  (i) Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss. 
Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the options are recognized 
in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The changes in the time value of the options that relate to the hedged item (“aligned time value”) are recognized within OCI in the costs of hedging reserve within equity. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, as 
follows:  
- Where the hedged item subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, both the deferred 
hedging gains and losses and the deferred time value of the option contracts or deferred forward points, if any, 
are included within the initial cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognized in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss. 
- The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings 
is recognized in profit or loss within finance cost at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged 
borrowings. 
When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time 
remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset. 
When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of 
hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(i) Financial instruments (continued) 
Derivatives and hedging activities (continued) 
(i) Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting (continued)  
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative 
instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in profit or loss. 
The Group has started to apply hedge accounting as of 1 July 2018 for existing participating cross currency 
swap and cross currency swap transactions in accordance with IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirement. IFRS 9 
includes new hedge accounting rules aiming alignment with risk management activities. 
The Group enters into participating cross currency swap and cross currency swap transactions in order to hedge 
the changes in cash flows of foreign exchange denominated fixed and floating rate financial instruments. While 
applying cash flow hedge accounting, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument is accounted for under “other comprehensive income/expense items to be reclassified to profit or 
loss” as a “hedging reserve” in equity, and the ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss. The changes recognized in equity is reclassified and included in profit or loss in the same period when the hedged cash 
flows effect the profit or loss. In addition, time value of options included in participating cross currency swaps are accounted for cost of hedging and recognized under other comprehensive income. 
The new effectiveness test model may be qualitative depending on the complexity of hedging relationship 
provided that it is prospective only. The 80-125% range in IAS 39 is replaced by an objectives-based test that focuses on the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, and the effect of 
credit risk on that economic relationship. 
Under IFRS 9, a hedging relationship is discontinued in its entirety when as a whole it ceases to meet the 
qualifying criteria after considering the rebalancing of the hedging relationship. Voluntary discontinuation 
when the qualifying criteria are met is prohibited. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the risk management 
objective for the hedging relationship has changed, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, there is no longer an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument or 
when the effect of credit risk starts dominating the value changes that result from the economic relationship. 
When the Group discontinues hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge it shall account for the amount that has 
been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance as follows;  
-if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur, that amount shall remain in the cash flow hedge 
reserve until the future cash flows occur.  
-When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time 
remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset. 
When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

(i) Financial instruments (continued) 
Derivatives and hedging activities (continued) 
(ii) Foreign currency hedge of net investments in foreign operations  
The Company designates its foreign currency bank loans to hedge its net investment in a foreign operation. 
Foreign exchange gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the foreign currency hedge of net investments in foreign operations are recognized in other comprehensive income while 
any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement. Tax effects of 
foreign exchange gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the foreign currency hedge of net investments in foreign operations is recognized under other comprehensive income as 
well.  
On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in equity is 
transferred to the income statement (Note 16). 
(j) Property, plant and equipment  
(i) Recognition and measurement  
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment losses. 
Property, plant and equipment related to the Company and its subsidiaries operating in Turkey are adjusted for 
the effects of inflation during the hyperinflationary period ended on 31 December 2005. Since the inflation 
accounting commenced on 1 January 2011, property, plant and equipment related to the subsidiaries operating 
in Belarus are adjusted for the effects of inflation. However, the decrease in inflation rate in subsequent years 
led the three-year cumulative rate as of the end of 2014 to decrease to 65%. Accordingly, the economy of Belarus was considered as transitioning out of hyperinflationary status and in 2015 it was determined to be 
appropriate to cease applying IAS 29. Therefore, subsidiaries operating in Belarus ceased applying IAS 29 in 2015. 
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-
constructed assets includes cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing 
the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located, if any.  
Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that 
equipment. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are 
included in profit or loss. 
Changes in the obligation to dismantle, remove assets on sites and to restore sites on which they are located, 
other than changes deriving from the passing of time, are added or deducted from the cost of the assets in the 
period in which they occur. The amount deducted from the cost of the asset shall not exceed the balance of the 
carrying amount on the date of change, and any excess balance is recognized immediately in profit or loss. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount 
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate 
asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. 
 (iii) Depreciation 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over 
their estimated useful lives.  
Land is not depreciated. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
 Buildings 21 – 25 years 
 Mobile network infrastructure 4 – 20 years 
 Fixed network infrastructure 3 – 25 years 
 Call center equipment 4 –   8 years 
 Equipment, fixtures and fittings 2 – 10 years 
 Motor vehicles 4 –   6 years 
 Leasehold improvements 3 –   5 years 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of 
each reporting period. 
(iv) Borrowing costs 
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 
of a qualifying asset are capitalized during the period that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its 
intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period to get ready for their intended use or sale. 
Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred
. 
 
(k) Intangible assets (i) Telecommunication licenses 
Separately acquired telecommunication licenses are stated at historical cost adjusted for the effects of inflation 
during the hyperinflationary period, where applicable, less amortization and impairment losses.  
 Amortization 
Amortization is recognized in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis by reference to the license 
period. The useful lives for telecommunication licenses are as follows: 
Telecommunications licenses 3 – 25 years 
 
The Company has been granted the 2G, 3G and 4.5G licenses on 27 April 1998, 30 July 2009 and  
26 August 2015, respectively. The licenses are effective for 25, 20 and 13 years, respectively.

 (ii) Computer software 
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized based on the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use 
the specific software. 
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognized as an expense as incurred.  Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software 
products controlled by the Group are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are met: 
 It is technically feasible to complete the software such that it will be available for use, 
 Management intends to complete the software and use or sell it, 
 There is an ability to use or sell the software, 
 It can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits, 
 Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software are available and 
 The expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured. 
Directly attributable costs that are capitalized as part of the software include employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. 
Research expenditure and development expenditure that do not meet the criteria above are recognized as an 
expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period. 
Capitalized development costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortized from the point at which the 
asset is ready for use. 
 Amortization 
Amortization is recognized in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful 
lives. The useful lives for computer software are as follows: 
 Computer software    3 – 8 years 
Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of 
each reporting period. 
(iii) Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group which have finite useful lives are stated at historical cost 
adjusted for the effects of inflation during the hyperinflationary period, where applicable, less amortization 
and impairment losses. Indefeasible Rights of Use (“IRU”) are rights to use a portion of an asset’s capacity 
granted for a fixed period of time. IRUs are recognized as intangible asset when the Group has specific indefeasible rights to use an identified portion of an underlying asset and the duration of the right is for the 
major part of the underlying asset's useful economic life. IRUs are amortized over the shorter of the underlying asset's useful economic life and the contract term.

 Transmission line software 5 – 10 years 
 Central betting system operating right    7 – 10 years 
 Customer base    2 – 15 years 
 Brand name    9 – 10 years 
 Indefeasible right of use    15 years 
Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of 
each reporting period.  
Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but it is 
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might 
be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an 
entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to 
those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which 
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating segments. 
 (l) Investment properties 
 Recognition and measurement  
Investment properties are properties held for rental yields and/or for capital appreciation (including property 
under construction for such purposes). Investment properties are stated at historical cost less depreciation and 
impairment losses. 
An investment property is derecognized upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising 
on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognized. 
 Depreciation 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Investment Property    25 - 45 years 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end 
of each reporting period.

(m) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventory is determined using the weighted average method and comprises all costs of purchase and other costs incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Costs of purchased inventory are determined 
after deducting rebates and discounts. At 31 December 2020 and 2019, inventories mainly consisted of mobile 
phone and its accessories, tablet, sim-cards, and tower construction materials.  
(n) Impairment of assets 
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested 
annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be 
impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs of disposal and its value in use. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-
generating unit. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels (cash-
generating units) for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the 
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an 
impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
(o) Employee benefits 
(i) Short-term obligations 
Liabilities for salaries including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within  
12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognized in 
respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as employee benefit obligations in the 
statement of financial position. 
 (ii) Termination benefits 
In accordance with the labor law in Turkey, the Company and its subsidiaries in Turkey are required to make 
lump-sum payments to employees who have completed one year of service and whose employment is 
terminated without cause or who retire, are called up for military service or die. Such payments  
are calculated based on 30 days' pay up to a of maximum full TL 7,117 as at 31 December 2020  
(31 December 2019: TL 6,380), per year of employment at the rate of pay applicable at the date of retirement 
or termination. Termination benefits paid to key executive officers are presented as other expenses. Reserve for employee termination benefits is computed and reflected in the consolidated financial statements on a 
current basis. Discount rate used for calculating employee termination benefit as of 31 December 2020 is 
3.01% (31 December 2019: 3.60%). The reserve is calculated by estimating the present value of future probable 
obligation of the Company and its subsidiaries in Turkey arising from retirement of employees. Reserve for 
employee termination benefits is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method.

(o) Employee benefits (continued)  
(iii) Defined contribution plans 
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension 
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations 
once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in 
the future payments is available.  
(iv) Share-based payments 
The Group provides a cash-settled share-based payment plan for selected employees in return for their services. 
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the Group measures services received and the liability 
incurred at the fair value of the liability. Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment plan are recognized 
as employee benefit expense over the relevant service period. The fair value of the liability is re-measured at 
each reporting date and at the settlement date. Any changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss for the period.  
(v) Personnel bonus 
Provision for bonus is provided when the bonus is a legal obligation, or past practice would make the bonus a 
constructive obligation and the Group is able to make a reliable estimate of the obligation. 
(p) Provisions 
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation.  
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement 
is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the 
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. 
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the outflow required to settle 
the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value 
is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.  
Onerous contracts 
Present obligation arising under an onerous contract is recognized and measured as a provision. An onerous 
contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.  
Dismantling, removal and restoring sites obligation The Group is required to incur certain costs in respect of a liability to dismantle and remove assets and to 
restore sites on which the assets were located. The dismantling costs are calculated according to best estimate of future expected payments discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

(q) Revenue 
Revenue is recognized at the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation. 
The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. Revenue is recognized when control is transferred to 
the customer. 
Revenue from telecommunication services includes postpaid and prepaid revenue from voice, data, messaging 
and value-added services, interconnect revenue, monthly fixed fees, SIM card sales and roaming revenue. The 
Company transfers control of these services over time and, therefore, satisfies the performance obligations and recognizes revenue from telecommunication services over time.  
With respect to prepaid revenue, the Group generally collects cash in advance by selling prepaid top up to 
distributors. In such cases, the Group does not recognize revenue until subscribers use the telecommunication 
services.  
Services may be bundled with other products and services and these bundled elements involve consideration 
in the form of a fixed fee or a fixed fee coupled with a continuing payment stream. A good or service is distinct if both of the following criteria are met: 
 The good or service is capable of being distinct,   
 The promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract. 
The arrangement consideration is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price. If an element of a transaction is not a distinct, then it is accounted for as an 
integral part of the remaining elements of the transaction. 
Revenue from device sales is recognized when control of the device has transferred, being the time when 
delivered to the end customer.  For device sales made to intermediaries, revenue is recognized at the time when control of the device has been transferred, being when the products are delivered to the intermediary and the 
intermediary has no general right to return the device to receive a refund. If control is not transferred, revenue is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or expiry of any right of return. 
The Group, the distributors and dealers offer joint campaigns to the subscribers which may include the sale of 
device by the dealer and/or the distributor and the sale of communication service by the Group. In certain campaigns, dealers make the handset sale to the subscribers, the instalments of which will be collected by the 
Group based on the letters of undertaking signed by the subscribers. With the letter of undertaking, the dealer 
assigns its receivables from handset sales to the distributor and the distributor assigns its receivables to the 
Group. 
The Group pays the distributor the net present value of the instalments to be collected from the subscribers and 
recognizes contracted receivables in its statement of financial position. The undue portion of assigned 
receivables from the distributors which were paid upfront by the Group is classified as “undue assigned 
contracted receivables” in trade receivables (Note 19). When monthly installment is invoiced to the subscriber, 
related portion is presented as “receivables from subscribers”. The Group collects the contracted receivables 
in installments during the contract period and does not recognize any revenue for the handset in these transactions when the Group does not act as principal for the sale of handset.  
Starting from 2016 the Group and distributors started to offer the option to buy a device through consumer 
financing loan, which will be collected by Turkcell Finansman. The Group carries a risk of collection in these 
transactions. Turkcell Finansman collects the purchased credit from the subscriber during the contract period 
and does not record revenue related to the device when it does not act  as principal for the sale of device. Revenue from financial services comprise of interest income generated from consumer financing activities. 
Interest income is recognized as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Independent auditor’s report and

Monthly fixed fees represent a fixed amount charged to postpaid subscribers on a monthly basis without regard 
to the level of usage. Fixed fees are recognized on a monthly basis when billed. Monthly fixed fees are included in telecommunication services revenues. 
Revenues from the betting business comprise of mainly the net takings earned to a maximum of 1.4% of gross 
takings as the head agent of fixed odds betting games and mobile agent revenues of 7.25% of mobile agency turnover after deducting VAT and gaming tax as the head agent. Revenues from the betting business are 
recognized at the time all services related to the games are fully rendered. Under the agreement signed with 
Spor Toto Teskilat Mudurlugu A.S. (“Spor Toto”), Inteltek Internet Teknoloji Yatirim ve Danismanlik A.S. (“Inteltek”) is obliged to undertake any excess payout, which is presented on a net basis.  
Azerinteltek QSC (“Azerinteltek”) received authorization from Azeridmanservis Limited Liability Company 
set under the Ministry of Youth and Sport of the Republic of Azerbaijan to organize, operate, manage and develop the fixed odds and paramutual sports betting business. Since Azerinteltek acts as principal, total 
consideration received from the player less payout (distribution to players) and amounts collected from players 
on behalf of Ministry of Sports is recognized at the time all services related to the games are fully rendered.  
Azerinteltek has been authorized for Lottery games by Azerlotereya. Azerinteltek has been generating 
commission revenue over Lottery games turnover through its own agencies by applying 15% commission rate 
according to the agreement between Azerinteltek and Azerlotereya. Commission revenues are recognized at 
the time all services related to the games are fully rendered. 
Call center revenues are recognized at the time services are rendered during the contractual period.  
When the Group sells goods or services as a principal, revenue and operating costs are recorded on a gross 
basis. When the Group sells goods or services as an agent, revenue and operating costs are recorded on a net 
basis, representing the net margin earned. Whether the Group is considered to be acting as principal or agent 
in the transaction depends on management’s analysis described below and such judgments impact the amount 
of reported revenue and operating costs but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows: 
Indicators that an entity is a principal: 
 The entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service, 
 The entity has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer 
or after transfer of control to the customer, 
 The entity has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. 
The Company and the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure of Turkey, Directorate General of 
Communications mutually agreed to extend the contract, to establish and operate mobile communication 
infrastructure and operation in uncovered areas, until 30 June 2021 and to add mobile broadband services to the existing infrastructure providing GSM services under Universal Service Law and to operate the new and 
existing networks together.
 As of 31 December 2020, the Company has recognized TL 223,965  
(31 December 2019: TL 191,235) revenue from its operations related to this contract. Since the Company acts 
as principal, revenue and operating costs are reported on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. 
The revenue recognition policy for other revenues is to recognize revenue as services are provided.

(q) Revenue (continued) 
Contract costs eligible for capitalization as incremental costs of obtaining a contract comprise commission on 
sale relating to prepaid and postpaid contracts with acquired or retained subscribers. Contract costs are 
capitalized in the month of service activation if the Group expects to recover those costs. Contract costs 
comprise sales commissions to dealers and to own salesforce which can be directly attributed to an acquired 
or retained contract. Contract costs are classified as intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements. 
The asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the customer lifetime, consistent with the pattern of recognition of the associated revenue. 
(r) Income taxes  
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based 
on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. 
Income tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. 
The current income tax charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end 
of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate 
taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in 
which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate based on amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability 
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they 
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using 
tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is 
settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilize those temporary differences and tax losses.  
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amount 
and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the Company is able to control the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and 
tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Companies within the Group may be entitled to claim special tax deductions for investments in qualifying 
assets or in relation to qualifying expenditure (e.g., the Research and Development Tax Incentive regime in Turkey or other investment allowances). The Group accounts for such allowances as tax credits, which means 
that the allowance reduces income tax payable and current tax expense. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unclaimed tax credits that are carried forward as deferred tax assets.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(s) Earnings per share 
The Group does not have any potential ordinary shares in issue, therefore basic and diluted earnings per share 
(“EPS”) are equal. Since basic and diluted EPS are equal, the Group presents both basic and diluted EPS on one line described as “Basic and diluted EPS”.  
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, excluding treasury shares. 
In Turkey, entities can increase their share capital by distributing “Bonus share” to shareholders from retained 
earnings. In computing earnings per share, such “Bonus share” distributions are treated as issued shares. 
Accordingly, the retrospective effect for such share distributions is taken into consideration when determining the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. 
(t) Government grants 
Grants from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and the Group will comply with all attached conditions. 
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized in profit or loss over the period necessary to 
match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate. Government grants relating to property, plant 
and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as deferred government grants, and are credited to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
 
(u) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations  
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through 
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and a sale is considered highly probable. They are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. 
 An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs 
of disposal. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs of disposal of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously 
recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset is recognized at the date of derecognition. 
An associate must meet the conditions to be classified as held for sale. It is first measured in accordance with 
applicable standards. Such standard is IAS 28, whereby the share of profits and remeasurement of carrying 
amounts are done in accordance with normal associate rules up to the point of classification as held for sale.  
The associate is then measured in accordance with IFRS 5. It is measured at the lower of carrying amount and 
fair value less costs of disposal. Equity accounting is ceased from the date the held for sale criteria are met. 
 Non-current assets classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of 
financial position.  
 A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single 
coordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired 
exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the 
statement of profit or loss.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(v) Equity 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares 
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity instruments, for example as the result of a 
share buy-back plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of 
income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company as treasury shares until 
the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the Company. 
(w) Dividends 
Provision is made for any dividend declared, being appropriately authorized and no longer at the 
discretion of the Company, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of 
the reporting period. 
(x) Subsequent events 
Events after the reporting date; includes all events between the reporting date and the date on which the 
financial statements are authorized for issue, even if any announcement of profit or other selected financial information has been made publicly disclosed.  
In case of events requiring correction after the reporting date, the Group corrects this new situation 
accordingly. Events that are not required to be adjusted subsequent to the reporting date are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  
(y) Leases 
At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset, The Group assesses whether:  
- The contract involved the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly; 
- The asset should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, the asset is not identified; 
- The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an asset 
throughout the period of use and  
- The Group has the right to direct use of the asset. The Group has the right when it has the  decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing the how and for what purpose the asset 
is used. If these decision are predetermined; 
- The Group has the right to operate the asset or,  
- The Group designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it is 
used.  
At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(y) Leases (continued) 
Right of use asset  
The Group recognizes a right-of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  
The right of use asset is initially recognized at cost comprising of: - Amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, 
- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, 
- Any initial direct costs incurred by the Group and 
- An estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, 
restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required 
by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. The 
lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period. 
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end date of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end 
date of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis 
as those property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by 
impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability (Note 29).  
Lease Liability  
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily 
determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.  
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:  
- Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, 
- Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or 
rate as the commencement date, 
- Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and  
- The exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewable period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension 
option, and penalties for early termination of a lease if the Group is reasonably certain to terminate 
early.  
After initial recognition, the lease liability is measured (a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on lease liability; (b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made, and (c) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised 
in-substance fixed lease payments. 
Where, (a) there is a change in the lease term as a result of reassessment of certainty to exercise an 
extension option, or not to exercise a termination option as discussed above; or (b) there is a change in 
the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, assessed considering the events and circumstances in the context of a purchase option, the Group remeasures the lease liabilities to reflect 
changes to lease payments by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The 
Group determines the revised discount rate as the interest rate implicit in the lease for the remainder of 
the lease term, or the its incremental borrowing rate at the date of reassessment, if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined.

Lease Liability (continued)  
Where, (a) there is a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or 
(b) there is a change in the future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to 
determine those payments, including change to reflect changes in market rental rates following a market 
rent review, the Group remeasures the lease liabilities by discounting the revised lease payments using an unchanged discount rate, unless the change in lease payments results from a change in floating interest 
rates. In such case, the Group uses the revised discount rate that reflects changes in the interest rate. 
The Group recognizes the amount of the remeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right of 
use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right of use asset is reduced zero and there is further reduction 
in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognizes any remaining amount of the 
remeasurement in profit or loss. 
The Group accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease if both: 
- The modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more 
underlying assets and 
- The consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the 
circumstances of the particular contract. 
The Group as a Lessor  
When the Group acts an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease 
separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use-asset arising 
from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.  
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the 
consideration in the contract.  
(z) New standards and interpretations  
i) Standards, amendments and interpretations applicable as at 31 December 2020 
- Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 on the definition of material;
 effective from Annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2020. These amendments to IAS 1, “Presentation of financial 
statements”, and IAS 8, “Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors”, and 
consequential amendments to other IFRSs: 
 Use a consistent definition of materiality throughout IFRSs and the Conceptual Framework 
for Financial Reporting, 
 Clarify the explanation of the definition of material,  
 Incorporate some of the guidance in IAS 1 about immaterial information. 
 
- Amendments to IFRS 3 - definition of a business; effective from Annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2020. This amendment revises the definition of a business. According to feedback 
received by the IASB, application of the current guidance is commonly thought to be too complex, 
and it results in too many transactions qualifying as business combinations. Independent auditor’s report and

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(z) New standards and interpretations (continued) 
i) Standards, amendments and interpretations applicable as at 31 December 2020 (continued) 
- Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Interest rate benchmark reform; effective from Annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. These amendments provide certain reliefs in connection with 
interest rate benchmark reform. The reliefs relate to hedge accounting and have the effect that IBOR reform 
should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness should 
continue to be recorded in the income statement. Given the pervasive nature of hedges involving IBOR-
based contracts, the reliefs will affect companies in all industries.  
 
- Amendment to IFRS 16, “Leases” - Covid-19 related rent concessions; effective from Annual periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020.  As a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, rent concessions 
have been granted to lessees. Such concessions might take a variety of forms, including payment holidays and deferral of lease payments. On 28 May 2020, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 16 that 
provides an optional practical expedient for lessees from assessing whether a rent concession related to 
COVID-19 is a lease modification. Lessees can elect to account for such rent concessions in the same way 
as they would if they were not lease modifications. In many cases, this will result in accounting for the 
concession as variable lease payments in the period(s) in which the event or condition that triggers the reduced payment occurs.  
ii) Standards, amendments and interpretations that are issued but not effective as at 31 December 2020 
- IFRS 17, “Insurance contracts”; effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. This 
standard replaces IFRS 4, which currently permits a wide variety of practices in accounting for insurance 
contracts. IFRS 17 will fundamentally change the accounting by all entities that issue insurance contracts 
and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. 
 
- Amendments to IAS 1, “Presentation of financial statements” on classification of liabilities; effective from 1 January 2022. These narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’, clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the 
end of the reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the 
reporting date (for example, the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant). The amendment also clarifies 
what IAS 1 means when it refers to the ‘settlement’ of a liability. 
 
- A number of narrow-scope amendments to IFRS 3, IAS 16, IAS 37 and some annual improvements on IFRS 1, IFRS 9, IAS 41 and IFRS 16; effective from Annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2022.  
 Amendments to IFRS 3 , ‘Business combinations’ update a reference in IFRS 3 to the Conceptual 
Framework for Financial Reporting without changing the accounting requirements for business combinations. 
 Amendments to IAS 16 , ‘Property, plant and equipment’ prohibit a company from deducting from 
the cost of property, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, a company will recognize such sales 
proceeds and related cost in profit or loss. 
 Amendments to IAS 37 , ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’ specify which 
costs a company includes when assessing whether a contract will be loss-making. 
Annual improvements make minor amendments to IFRS 1, ‘First-time Adoption of IFRS’,  
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, IAS 41, ‘Agriculture’ and the Illustrative Examples accompanying 
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’.

 3. Financial risk management 
This note explains the Group’s exposure to financial risks and how these risks could affect the Group’s future 
financial performance. Current year profit and loss information has been included where relevant to add further 
context. 
The Group’s risk management policies are set to determine and analyze the risks faced, to establish the appropriate 
risk limits and to observe the commitment to those limits. These policies are constantly reviewed to make sure 
they reflect the Group’s operations and the changes in market conditions. 
Credit risk  
At the reporting date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk is represented by the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, financial asset at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, financial asset at amortize cost, derivative financial instruments, contract assets, trade 
receivables, receivables from financial services, due from related parties and other current and non-current assets 
(Note 36). 
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The 
Group may require collateral in respect of financial assets. Also, the Group may demand letters of guarantee from 
third parties related to certain projects or contracts. The Group may also demand certain pledges from counterparties if necessary, in return for the credit support it gives related to certain financings (Note 19). 
In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to whether they are subscribers, financial 
services customers, other corporate customers and aging profile, maturity and existence of previous financial 
difficulties. Trade receivables and contract assets are mainly related to the Group’s subscribers. The Group’s 
exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and contract assets is influenced mainly by the individual payment 
characteristics of postpaid subscribers. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade receivables and contract assets. This allowance comprises the 
general provision which is determined based on a loss event.  
Investments are preferred to be in liquid securities. The counterparty limits are set monthly depending on their 
ratings from the most credible rating agencies and the amount of their paid-in capital and/or shareholders equity. 
Policies are in place to review the paid-in capital and rating of counterparties periodically to ensure credit 
worthiness. 
The Group signs local and international derivate agreements in order to be able to execute financial derivative 
transactions with financial institutions that are believed to have sufficient credit ratings.  
The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to subsidiaries and distributors. At 31 December 2020, 
guarantees of TL 2,171,281 were outstanding (31 December 2019: TL 3,323,318). 
Liquidity risk  
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an 
adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out market positions. 
At the end of the reporting period the Group held demand deposits of TL 975,753  
(31 December 2019: TL 632,022) that are expected to readily generate cash inflows for managing liquidity risk. 
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group Treasury maintains flexibility in funding by 
maintaining availability under committed credit lines. 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (Note 36) and cash and cash equivalents 
(Note 24) on the basis of expected cash flows. In addition, the Group’s liquidity management policy involves 
projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, 
monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining 
debt financing plans.

 3. Financial risk management (continued) 
Market risk  
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices 
affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk 
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the 
return on risk. The Group uses derivatives in order to manage market risks. All such transactions are carried at within the guidelines set by the Group Treasury. 
(i) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency 
transactions, primarily with respect to the USD, EUR and RMB. Foreign exchange risk arises from recognized assets 
and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the relevant Group entity. The Group holds a significant portion of its cash and cash equivalent in foreign currencies in order to manage foreign exchange 
risk. In addition, derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange 
rates and since 1 July 2018 the Company applies hedge accounting. Details of the Company’s foreign exchange risk 
is disclosed in Note 36. 
(ii) Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is related to its financial assets and liabilities. The Group manage its 
financial liabilities by providing an appropriate distribution between fixed and floating rate loans. Floating rate 
exposures can be changed to fixed rate exposures based on short term and long term market expectations via 
financial derivatives. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group Treasury’s policies approved by the 
Audit Committee, which provide written principles on the use of derivatives. The Group’s borrowings and receivables are carried at amortized cost. The borrowings are periodically contractually repriced (Note 36) and are 
also exposed to the risk of future changes in market interest rates. 
Effect of IBOR reform Following the financial crisis, the reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as USD LIBOR and 
other interbank offered rates (‘IBORs’) has become a priority for global regulators. There are ongoing studies for 
these changes. The Group’s risk exposure that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform is its  
USD 367,787 floating-rate debt. The Group has hedged this debt with participating cross currency, cross currency and interest swaps, and it has designated at participating cross currency swap in a cash flow hedge of the variability 
in cash flows of the debt, due to changes in 6-month USD LIBOR that is the current benchmark interest rate after 
the publication of Phase-2 in August 2020. The nominal amount of these derivative instruments is USD 431,359 
and the nominal amount of the hedged part of these instruments is USD 276,069. 
The Group treasury department oversees the Group’s USD LIBOR transition plan. This transition project will 
include changes to systems, processes, risk and valuation models, as well as managing related tax and accounting 
implications. The Group currently anticipates that the areas of greatest change will be amendments to the contractual 
terms of the USD LIBOR-referenced floating-rate debt and the participating cross currency swap and updating hedge 
designations. 
Effect of IBOR reform – significant assumptions 
In calculating the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk of the floating-rate debt, the Group has made 
the following assumptions that reflect its current expectations: - The floating-rate debt will move to an alternative benchmark rate during 2022, and the spread will be similar to 
the spread included in the participating cross currency swap used as the hedging instrument; 
- No other changes to the terms of the floating-rate debt are anticipated; and 
- The Group has incorporated the uncertainty over when the floating-rate debt will move to an alternative benchmark 
rate, the resulting adjustment to the spread, and the other aspects of the reform that have not yet been finalized by adding an additional spread to the discount rate used in the calculation. Independent auditor’s report and

 4. Segment information 
The Group has two reportable segments in accordance with its integrated communication and technology services 
strategy - Turkcell Turkey and Turkcell International. While some of these strategic segments offer the same types 
of services, they are managed separately because they operate in different geographical locations and are affected by different economic conditions. 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker. The chief operating decision maker function is carried out by the Board of Directors, however Board of Directors may transfer the authorities, other than recognized by the law, to the CEO and other directors. 
Turkcell Turkey reportable segment includes the operations of Turkcell, Turkcell Superonline Iletisim Hizmetleri 
A.S. (“Turkcell Superonline”), Turkcell Satis ve Dijital Is Servisleri Hizmetleri A.S. (“Turkcell Satis”), group call center operations of Global Bilgi Pazarlama Danismanlik ve Cagri Servisi Hizmetleri A.S. (“Turkcell Global 
Bilgi”), Turktell Bilisim Servisleri A.S. (“Turktell”), Turkcell Teknoloji Arastirma ve Gelistirme A.S. (“Turkcell 
Teknoloji”), Kule Hizmet ve Isletmecilik A.S. (“Global Tower”), Rehberlik Hizmetleri Servisi A.S. (“Rehberlik”), Turkcell Gayrimenkul Hizmetleri A.S. (“Turkcell Gayrimenkul”), Lifecell Dijital Servisler ve 
Cozumler A.S. (“Lifecell Dijital Servisler”), Lifecell Bulut Cozumleri A.S. (“Lifecell Bulut”), Lifecell TV Yayin 
ve Icerik Hizmetleri A.S. (“Lifecell TV”), Lifecell Muzik Yayin ve Iletim A.S. (“Lifecell Muzik”) and BiP Iletisim Teknolojileri ve Dijital Servisler Anonim Sirketi (“BiP Iletisim”). Turkcell International reportable 
segment includes the operations of Kibris Mobile Telekomunikasyon Limited Sirketi (“Kibris Telekom”), East 
Asian Consortium B.V. (“Eastasia”), Lifecell LLC (“lifecell”), Lifecell Ventures Cooperatief U.A (“Lifecell Ventures”), Beltel Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. (“Beltel”), CJSC Belarusian Telecommunications Network 
(“Belarusian Telecom”), LLC UkrTower (“UkrTower”), LLC Global Bilgi (“Global LLC”), Turkcell Europe 
GmbH (“Turkcell Europe”), Lifetech LLC (“Lifetech”), Beltower LLC (“Beltower”), Lifecell Digital Limited (“Lifecell Digital”), Yaani Digital BV (“Yaani”) and BiP Digital Communication Technologies B.V (“BiP 
Digital”). The operations of these legal entities aggregated into one reportable segment as the nature of services 
are similar and most of them share similar economic characteristics. Other reportable segment mainly comprises the non-group call center operations of Turkcell Global Bilgi and the operations of Turkcell Finansman, Turkcell 
Odeme Hizmetleri A.S. (“Turkcell Odeme”), Turkcell Enerji Cozumleri ve Elektrik Satis Ticaret A.S (“Turkcell 
Enerji”), Paycell LLC and Turkcell Sigorta Aracilik Hizmetleri A.S (“Turkcell Sigorta”). 
The Board primarily uses adjusted EBITDA to assess the performance of the operating segments. Adjusted

The Turkish entities within the Group are subject to corporate tax at the rate of 20%. Corporate tax is 
applied on taxable corporate income, which is calculated from the statutory accounting profit by adding 
back non-deductible expenses, and by deducting tax exempt income. On 5 December 2017, Turkey’s Law 
No. 7061 on the Amendment of Certain Tax Laws and Some Other Laws, and which was adopted on  28 November 2017, was published in the Official Gazette. The Law increases the corporate tax rate under 
Corporate Tax Law, No. 5520, from the current 20% rate to 22% for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020; the 
change took effect on the Law’s date of publication. The corporate tax rate decreases to 20% in 2021. 
In Turkey, there is no procedure for a final and definitive agreement on tax assessments. Companies file 
their tax returns by the end of the fourth month following the closing of the accounting year to which they 
relate. Corporate tax payment is made by the end of the month in which the tax return is filed. The tax 
authorities may, however, examine such returns and the underlying accounting records, and may revise assessments within a five-year period. Advance tax returns are filed on a quarterly basis. 
In Turkey, the transfer pricing provisions have been stated under Article 13 of Corporate Tax Law with 
the heading of “disguised profit distribution via transfer pricing”. The General Communiqué on disguised 
profit distribution via Transfer Pricing, dated 18 November 2007 sets out the details of implementation.

perform the valuation of investment properties. Management works closely with the qualified external 
experts to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The fair values of these 
investment properties were determined using a variety of valuation methods: income capitalization 
approach and market approach . In estimating the fair values of the properties, the highest and best use of 
the property is its current use. 
Rent income from investment properties during the year ended 31 December 2020 is TL 5,855 
(31 December 2019: TL 4,078 and 31 December 2018: TL 3,092). There is TL 294 direct operating 
expense for investment properties during the year ended 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: TL 522 
and 31 December 2018: None).  Independent auditor’s report and

Market approach  
 -  28,985  21,520    
Significant unobservable inputs and sensitivity of fair values of respective investment properties are as 
follows: 
In the “income capitalization” approach, a significant increase/(decrease) in rentals will cause a significant 
increase/(decrease) in the fair value. In addition, a slight decrease/(increase) in risk premium and discount 
rate which are calculated by considering current market conditions will cause a significant 
increase/(decrease) in the fair value.  
In the “market approach”, a significant increase/(decrease) in the market value of any properties which 
are located in similar areas with similar conditions will cause a significant increase/(decrease) in the fair 
value.

Fair value of derivative instruments and risk management 
 
This section explains the judgments and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial 
instruments that are recognized and measured at fair value in the financial statements. To provide an indication of the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has classified its 
financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standards. An explanation of 
each level is as follows:  
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
entity can access at the measurement date; 
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

 (*) Since the bid-ask spread is unobservable input; in the valuation of participating cross currency swap contracts, prices in the bid- ask price range that were considered the most appropriate were used instead of mid prices. If mid prices were used in the valuation the fair value of participating cross currency swap contracts would have been TL 168,882 lower as at  
31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: TL 116,684).

Net off / Offset 
The Company signed a Credit Support Annex (CSA) against the default risk of parties in respect of a 
EUR 366,800 participating cross currency swap transaction executed on 15 July 2016 and restructured respectively on 26 May 2017 and 9 August 2018. Additionally, in the 25 June 2019, The Company signed 
a new CSA to EUR 48,012 participating cross currency swap transaction. As per the CSA, the swap’s current (mark-to-market) value will be determined on the 10th and 24th calendar day of each calendar 
month, and if the mark-to-market value is positive and exceeds a certain threshold, the bank will be 
posting cash collateral to the Company which will be equal to an amount exceeding the threshold (i.e. if the mark-to-market value is negative, the Company would be required to post collateral to the bank by an 
amount exceeding the threshold). 
With respect to valuations, on a bi-weekly basis, a transfer will take place between the parties only if the 
mark-to-market value changes by at least EUR 1,000. Following the execution of CSA, the bank 
transferred to the Company EUR 268,563 as collateral (31 December 2020: TL 2,419,189) which was the 
amount exceeding the threshold and the Company transferred EUR 144,083 as collateral to the bank  (31 December 2020: TL 1,297,886) which was the amount exceeding the threshold. The Company 
clarified this with the derivative assets included in the statement of financial position because it has the 
legal right to offset the collateral amount TL 1,121,303 that it recognizes under the borrowings and intends to pay according to the net fair value. This amount was netted from the borrowings and deducted from 
the derivative instruments in the balance sheet. As of 31 December 2020, were this transaction not 
conducted, derivative financial instruments assets would have been TL 2,038,740 and current borrowings  TL 6,354,040. 
Market risk 
The Group uses various types of derivatives to manage market risks. All such transactions are carried out 
within the guidelines set by the treasury and risk management department. Generally, the Group seeks to 
apply hedge accounting to manage volatility in profit or loss.

 35. Derivative financial instruments (continued) 
Fair value of derivative instruments and risk management (continued) 
Currency risk 
The Group’s risk management policy is to hedge its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of 
borrowing payments with various maturities at any point in time. The Group uses participating cross currency contracts to hedge its currency risk, mostly with a maturity of over one year from the reporting 
date. These contracts are generally designated as cash flow hedges. 
 
The Group designates the hedge ratio, between the amount of the hedged item and the hedging instrument 
is 1:1 to hedge its currency risk.  
 
The time value of options in participating cross currency swap contracts are included in the designation 
of the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging, which is recognized in 
equity in a cost of hedging reserve. The Group’s policy is for the critical terms of the participating cross 
currency contracts to align with the hedged item.  
The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instruments and 
hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Group assesses 
whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in 
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.  
In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are; 
- The effect of the counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the swap contracts, which is not part of 
the hedged risk and associated credit risk considered to be very low at inception in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates;   
- The entire fair value of the derivative contracts including currency basis was designated as the hedging 
instrument in cash flow hedge. The hypothetical derivative is modelled to exclude the impact of currency basis. 
 
Interest rate risk 
 
The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its interest rate risk exposure is at a fixed rate. This is achieved partly by entering into fixed-rate instruments and partly by borrowing at a floating rate and using cross 
currency and interest rate swaps as hedges of the variability in cash flows attributable to movements in interest rates. The Group applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. 
 
The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and 
hedged item based on the reference interest rates, tenors, repricing dates and maturities and the notional 
or par amounts. 
The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be 
effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method. 
 
In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are: 
 - The effect of the counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the swap contracts, which is not part of 
the hedged risk and associated credit risk considered to be very low at inception in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in interest rates;

Impairment losses 
Individual receivables, which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying 
amount directly. The other receivables are assessed collectively to determine whether there is objective 
evidence that an impairment has been incurred but not yet identified. The Group considers that there is 
evidence of impairment if any of the following indicators are present: 
 Significant financial difficulties of the customer, 
 Probability that the customer will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization and 
 Default or delinquency in payments.  
Receivables for which an impairment provision was recognized are written off against the provision when 
there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. 
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss within net impairment losses on financial and contract 
assets (Note 10). Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against Net 
impairment losses on financial and contract assets (Note 10). 
Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables, contract assets, other assets and due from 
related parties are as follows:

Exposure to currency risk 
Sensitivity analysis  
The basis for the sensitivity analysis to measure foreign exchange risk is an aggregate corporate-level currency 
exposure. The aggregate foreign exchange exposure is  composed of all assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies, the analysis excludes net foreign currency investments. 
A 10% strengthening/weakening of the TL, UAH, BYN, EUR against the following currencies as at  
31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 would have increased/(decreased) profit or loss before by the 
amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.

 Fair values  
Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
This section explains the judgments and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial 
instruments that are recognized and measured at fair value in the financial statements. To provide an 
indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standards. An explanation of 
each level is as follows: 
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
entity can access at the measurement date; 
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Independent auditor’s report and
