The content for our 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report Highlights and Chevron.com was determined by an issue prioritization process. First, a team of employees from across our business segments identiﬁ  ed environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) topics relevant to our business. The team also considered issues covered by the IPIECA/API/OGP
* 
2010 Oil and gas industry guidance on voluntary 
sustainability reporting , topics address ed in previous 
Corporate Responsibility Reports, feedback received on the 2013 Corporate Responsibility Report from internal and external audiences, media analysis, and industry peer review. Then, the team prioritized the identiﬁ  ed issues based on an internal analysis 
of topics and their importance to our stakeholders — investors, customers, host governments, local communities and our employees.
Our prioritized content is aligned with IPIECA/
API/OGP indicators. For 2014, Chevron reported fully to all 33 indicators. An IPIECA/API/OGP content index is available on page 23 of this report. In addition to this Highlights report, our expanded reporting on these indicators can be found at Chevron.com/IPIECA .

John S. Watson
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerMay 2015
At Chevron, our vision is to be the global energy company 
most admired for its people, partnership and performance. To accomplish this, we’ve built our company’s foundation on our values, which distinguish and guide us in all we do. These values are laid out in The Chevron Way, a key corporate document that provides a framework for us to follow in getting results the right way. Our 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report highlights three of our speciﬁ  c 
values — partnership, diversity, and protecting people and the environment.
We believe that business investments are the foundation 
of corporate responsibility. Not only do we produce reliable and affordable energy to enable economies, but also, in doing so we advance the communities in which we operate by purchasing local goods and services, creating jobs, and generating revenue. In 2014, for example, we spent more than $63 billion on goods and services globally. Of that, nearly $1 billion was spent on goods and services from women- and minority-o wned busin esses in the 
United States and more than $2.5 billion on goods and services from U.S .-based small busin esses. 
Beyond our direct business investments, we make select 
social investments in three core areas — health, education and economic development — to develop skilled workers, improve access to health care, and boost local and regional economies. We know that health y busin esses r equire healthy 
communities. To this end, we’ve made approximately $1.7 billion in social investments to local communities over the past nine years. And in 2014 alone, we spent approxi-mately $240 million on global social investments. We make these business and social investments in partner-
ship with local governments and communities, our busi-ness partners, and our stakeholders. Everywhere Chevron operates, we strive to build partnerships to create lasting prosperity. We work to identify community needs, and then we invest in solutions and programs that will create meas-urable and enduring value. Our commitment is to manage the effects of our operations and make strategic social investments throughout the life cycles of our projects. 
To ensure our people are well equipped to work with 
our partners, we are committed to building a workforce that represents the many countries where we operate. We believe that sustainable high performance is achieved by creating a culture that encourages and values people who offer a wide range of experiences and knowledge. In 2014, Chevron received prestigious honors and recognition for promoting a diverse and inclusive workforce. For the 10th consecutive year, we achieved a rating of 100 percent on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, which ranks U.S. companies committed to equality in the workplace. We were the only company in the oil and natural gas industry to earn a perfect score. In 2015, Chevron received the Catalyst Award in recognition of our effort to attract, retain, develop and advance women. Valuing diversity in our workforce is key to achieving our vision to be the global energy company most admired for 
its people, partnership and performance.
We know our continued success depends on our perform-
ance. Our Operational Excellence Management System provides a disciplined approach to working safely, protect-ing the environment, and operating reliably and efﬁ  ciently. 
In 2014, we delivered our best overall year in personal 
safety, as measured by recordable injuries and injuries requiring time away from work, and in process safety, as measured by loss-of-containment incidents. We also had record lows in our petroleum spill volume and motor vehicle crash rate. Our relentless focus on operational excellence — including efforts to strengthen process safety management and ensure the integrity of safeguards — contributed to the strong overall performance. 
Chevron is committed to meeting our goal of zero 
incidents and will continue to focus on achieving world-class performance in all measures of safety and environ-mental stewardship. You can track our efforts online at Chevron.com/CR, where we provide details about our efforts to invest in people, projects and communities that make our business possible.A Message From Our Chairman and CEO2 Chevron.com/CRProtecting People and the Environment
Chevron’s Operational 
Excellence Management System is how we system-atically manage process safety, personal safety and health, the environment, reliability, and efﬁ  ciency. 
We audit our pr ocesses , stand-
ards and regulatory require-ments to assure compliance, identify and manage risk of incidents, ensure preparedness for emergency response, and improve overall performance, focusing on ﬁ  ve areas:
Safety:  Achieve an incident- 
and injury-free workplace. 
Health:  Promote a healthy 
workforce and mitigate signiﬁ  -
cant workplace health risks.
Environment:  Identify and 
mitigate environmental and process safety risks. 
Reliability:  Operate with 
industry-leading asset integ-rity and reliability.
Efﬁ ciency:  Efﬁ ciently use 
natural resources and assets.
Our commitment to operational 
excellence extends beyond our employees to also include our contractor workforce, our supply chain partners and the communities where we operate.5
Our Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS) is a 
comprehensive, proven means to systematically manage process safety, personal safety and health, the environment, reliability, and efficiency. Through disciplined application of the OEMS, we 
identify and mitigate risks by integrating operational excellence processes, st andards, procedures and behaviors into our daily 
operations. Our OEMS is aligned with ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007, as well as with the Center for Chemical Process Safety’s Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety .
*
Within the OEMS, we use a management system process to drive 
continual improvement toward world-class performance. This process 
is linked to business planning and begins with defining a vision of success and setting objectives. Gaps between current performance and th ese objectives are identified during annual a ssessmen ts. 
We develop plans to close the gaps, implement the plans and review plan implementation performance.
We set high expectations for ourselves, which requires active 
leadership.  Chevron’s Board of Directors and Board committees 
oversee Chevron’s risk management policies and practices. In doing so, the Board monitors the risk a ssessmen t and management sys-
tems that are employed throughout the company. We also adopt and share best practices with our business and industry partners, and we continually take action to improve our practices and meet our commitments. In 2014, our Days Away From Work Rate for our employees and contractor workforce, at 0.02 per 200,000 work-hours, matched our 2013 record low rate.
 *  According to Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd., our OEMS meets the requirements of the 
International Organization for Standardization environmental management system standard and the Occupational Health and Safety A ssessmen t Series management system speciﬁ  cation. Managing 
 Operational Risk
Ingrained in The Chevron Way is our 
commitment to protecting people and the environment, which includes developing energy safely and reliably. We strive to develop a culture in which everyone believes that all incidents are preventable and that “zero incidents” is achievable.

Process Safety 
We apply our Operational Excellence Management System to manage process safety and work to prevent serious inci-dents, such as explosions, ﬁ  res 
and accidental releases. Along with our ongoing operational focus, we conduct reviews of facilities to reduce risk, perform ﬁ eld validation of safeguards to 
ensure they are effective, con-tinuously improve process safety operating procedures, and con-duct hazard analyses to identify ways to prevent injury and loss of containment.
We saw a signiﬁ  cant 
reduction in Tier 1 loss-

Chevron works to minimize the 
risks and impacts associated with all aspects of the life cycle of our products, including manufacture, transport, use and disposal. We assess  safety, health and 
environmental information, as well as compliance with product safety legal requirements both where our products are made and where they are sold or used. Our OEMS is designed to help assess  compliance with product 
stewardship requirements around the world.
The Globally Harmonized 
System of Classiﬁ  cation 
and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) is being implemented in more

Protecting people and the 
environment is one of our company’s core values, as detailed in The Chevron Way. 
In support of our values, we 
developed four environmental principles that deﬁ  ne our 
commitment to doing busi-ness in environmentally responsible ways:
Include the Environment in 
Decision Making:  We all make 
decisions that may affect the environment. From our everyday actions to major capital investments, we make better decisions when we consider the environment. 
Reduce Our Environmental 
Footprint:  We use our 
business  proc esses to  identify 
and manage risks to the environment and reduce potential environmental impacts throughout the life of our assets.
Operate Responsibly:  We 
apply our Tenets of Operation and improve reliability and process safety to prevent accidental releases. 
Steward Our Sites:  We work 
to decommission, remediate and reclaim operating and legacy sites with the aim of beneﬁ  cial reuse.4Environmental
Principles Protecting 
 the Environment
Chevron develops energy resources with a 
commitment to protecting the environment using world-class environmental practices and standards. For Chevron, getting results the right way happens throughout the life of our facilities  — from planning and construction through operation and decommissioning.
To achieve this, we use our Operational Excellence Management 
System to manage potential impacts from the activities that may affect the environment. Through the application of our Corporate Proc esses and Standards and our work with industry groups, 
our busin esses identify meaningful inf ormation that enables them 
to prioritize and focus their continuous improvement efforts.

Chevron is Kazakhstan’s largest private oil and 
gas producer, with a 50 percent interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO). Since 2000, TCO has invested approximately $3 billion in envi-ronmental projects and has increased gas utilization rates to more than 99 percent by using the produced gas as a fuel, reinjecting it into the Tengiz Field reservoir, or selling it on the domestic and export mar-kets. Gas utilization and other programs have increased energy efﬁ ciency and helped reduce

In addition, as part of a ﬁ  ve-year collaboration with KEHATI (Indonesian Biodiversity Foundation), a nongovernmental organization, Chevron supported and provided volunteers for the restoration of degraded forest corridors outside our operational area within the national park. 
Climate Change 
and Energy Efﬁ  ciency 
We share the concerns of 
governments and the public about climate change risks and recognize that the use of fossil fuels to meet the world’s energy needs is a contributor to rising greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the earth’s atmosphere. We are taking steps to manage GHGs and other air emissions while supporting the growth of the Biodiversity

We recognize that water, and 
particularly fresh water, is a critical resource for business, communities and the environ-ment. Although our industry is not among the largest users of fresh water in California, we continue to improve our water management practices as the state faces severe drought.
Chevron’s California 
reﬁ neries use recycled and 
reclaimed water for the majority of their water needs. Since 1999, recycled water has supplied more than 70 percent of water needs at our El Segundo Reﬁ  nery. 
Today, approximately 60 percent of water used at our Richmond 
asset retirement work. EMC puts Chevron’s environmental prin-ciples into practice across the enterprise, working in more than 35 countries around the world.
Chevron helped convert 
property at our former 
Louisville, Kentucky, lubricants plant, after a century of use, into a student parking lot for the University of Louisville. EMC provided oversight of the beneﬁ  -
cial reuse project, ensuring that the site was redeveloped in a way that protected public health and that solar-powered technol-ogies were used during the site remediation work. Reﬁ nery comes from reclaimed 
municipal sources. In addition, our Kern River and San Ardo oil ﬁ elds capture and treat pro-
duced water
* for agricultural 
use. For every one barrel of oil we extract in Kern County, the process generates 10 barrels of produced water, some of which we capture, treat and distribute to local farmers.

Chevron was honored to 
receive the prestigious 2015 Catalyst Award, the premier honor for companies committed to expanding opportunities for women. 
Our application for the 
Catalyst Award — titled 
“The Chevron Way: Engineering Opportunities for Women”— details how 
The Chevron Way’s focus on people over the past two decades established a culture that attracted and retained more diverse talent in our workforce.
The application also shows 
how The Chevron Way served as a primary driver for our diversity strategy that includes programs, proc-esses and tools to facilitate 
gender diversity and help increase the number of women in leadership roles. 
To be considered for the 
Catalyst Award, we partici-pated in a rigorous, yearlong application and review process that included extensive documentation and interviews with more than 60 employees and leaders. We shared information and perspectives with Catalyst regarding our business rationale, senior leadership support, account-ability, communication, employee engagement, inno-vation and measurable results.

than or equal to one barrel are included. 
  Petroleum spill volume in 2014 set a 
record low — 50 percent below our previous lowest result (1,700 barrels in 2012). The number of petroleum spills in 2014 was also the lowest ever recorded for Chevron. In 2014, 79 petroleum spills released 838 barrels, compared with 2,135 barrels released by 133 spills in 2013.
 2 In 2014, our freshwater withdrawals 
totaled 85 million metric tons, a 9 per-cent decrease compared with 2013. To reduce our freshwater demand, we reused and recycled wastewater.
 3 Oil concentration is determined by the 
sampling of effluent streams. 
  Chevron reports the total cumulative 
amount of oil discharged to surface water excluding spills, which are reported separately. In 2014, Chevron operations recorded a cumulative discharge of 1,311 metric tons of oil to surface water, a decrease of 8 percent from 1,418 metric tons in 2013. 
 4 In 2014, emissions were 56 million metric 
tons of CO
2 equivalent, better than our 
goal of 58 million metric tons. Chevron’s chosen base-year emissions in 2010, which account for adjustments like acquisitions and divestitures, would have been 56 mil-lion metric tons. Therefore, Chevron’s 2014 emissions are about the same as the base-year emissions. The 2014 flaring and venting GHG emissions are based on a flare gas volume of 563 million cubic feet per day and a venting volume of 69 million cubic feet per day. 
  Chevron’s GHG emissions goal for 2015 is 
57 million metric tons of CO
2 equivalent. 
To meet anticipated worldwide energy demand, Chevron’s long-term strategy has been to grow profitably in core areas and add production in new areas. Accordingly, Chevron is projecting net production of 3.1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day in 2017. As Chevron’s business grows beyond 2015 for the long term, absolute GHG emissions will increase. The emissions’ intensity will also grow as the energy intensity of the operations increases, though it will be moderated by continuing improvements in energy efficiency and minimizing flar-ing. For example, much of our projected emissions growth will be in liquefied natural gas (LNG) production. When used in power generation, LNG can drive improved global, life-cycle GHG emissions compared with other fuels. Similarly, 
our gas-to-liquids project in Nigeria will provide a beneficial outlet for gas that might otherwise have been flared — a direct result of our efforts toward reduc-ing flaring, which have been under way for several years.
  Combustion of our products resulted in 
emissions of 358 million metric tons of CO
2 equivalent in 2014, which is lower 
than the 363 million metric tons emitted in 2013.
 5 The total energy consumption of 
Chevron’s operated assets in 2014 was 702 trillion Btu, at a cost of $6.5 billion.
 6 VOC emissions decreased by 8 percent 
from 2013. VOCs declined significantly beginning in 2012 in part from the instal-lation of abatement devices in Sumatra as well as improved emissions estimation methodologies. VOCs result primarily from fugitive emissions from equipment (such as valves, pump s and compr essors), 
flaring, venting and flashing gas. 
  Sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions decreased 
by 20 percent from 2013. The decrease resulted from new opportunities to col-lect and export gas that previously was flared in Saudi Arabia/the Partitioned Zone. Nitrogen oxides (NO
X) and sulfur 
oxides (SO X) are combustion byproducts.
  Some prior years’ air emissions are 
restated in this report using site-specific data and improved air emissions estimating methods.
 7 Actual air emissions data (including 
VOC, SO
X and NO X data) for certain 
Downstream and Chemicals facilities are not currently finalized because regulatory deadlines for submitting air emissions data fall after the publication date of the Corporate Responsibility Report. In these cases, an estimate based on previous data is used in place of actual emissions data. Consequently, the total air emissions for Downstream and Chemicals may vary after all data are reported. 
 8 Waste amounts are quantified using 
methods required or recommended by regulatory agencies or authorities where applicable. In other instances, similar methods are used, including direct measurement onsite or at the point of shipping, engineering estimates, or process knowledge. 
  Chevron follows the regulatory defini-
tions of hazardous waste, including de minimis  specifications, below which 
hazardous waste quantities do not need to be reported. 9 2014 environmental, health and safety 
fines and settlements were $56.8 million. Health and safety fines and settlements accounted for approximately $261,860, representing 0.5 percent of the total fines and settlements.
 10 Health and safety performance rates 
include both injury- and illness-related incidents. 
  The American Petroleum Institute’s 
Benchmarking Survey of Occupational Injuries, Illn esses and Fatalities in the 
Petroleum Industry  data are used as 
industry benchmarks. Benchmark data on competitor-average performance in 2014 were not available at the time of publication.
 11 Data include catastrophic and major 
incidents only.
 12 Loss-of-containment incidents are 
unplanned or uncontrolled releases resulting in consequences equivalent to those specified by the American National Standards Institute/American Petroleum Institute (ANSI/API) Recommended Practice 754 and Oil and Gas Producers (OGP) Report 456: Process Safety Recommended Practice on Key Performance Indicators.Notes to pages 18 through 21Performance Data Chevron.com/CR 23IPIECA/API/OGP WHERE REPORTED

Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:
•  Proc esses were  in place to ensure that sites contributing to HES metrics 
understood corporate reporting procedures and requirements.
•  Methods used for calculating each HES performance metric were clearly 
defined and communicated.
•  Chevron’s reporting requirements for HES metrics were understood 
and carried out. Data collected at the site/local and business-unit levels were checked and aggregated into corporationwide metrics.
•  Responsibility for annually reviewing and updating reporting guidelines 
was clear, with improvement in methodology regularly undertaken.
Recommendations 
  Additional areas for improvement were provided in a separate report to 
Chevron management. These recommendations do not affect our opinion.

LRQA Assurance Statement
Relating to Chevron Corporation’s Corporate Responsibility Report for the Calendar Year 2014
This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Chevron U.S.A. 
Inc. in accordance with our contract but is intended for the readers of this Report. 
Terms of Engagement
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Inc. (LRQA) was commissioned by Chevron U.S.A. Inc. on behalf of Chevron Corporation (Chevron) to provide independent assuranc e on its proc esses used in the creation 
of the Corporate Responsibility Report (CRR) for calendar year 2014 to a reasonable level using LRQA’s verification approach.
Our assurance engagement covered Chevron’s operations and activ-
ities worldwide and specifically covered the following requirements:
•  Reviewing the effectiv eness  of the proc esses f or reporting health, 
environmental and safety (HES) IPIECA performance indicators.
•  Confirming consistency with the IPIECA/API/OGP  Oil and gas 
industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting  (2010) 
industry guidelines.
  Our assurance engagement did not include verifying the accuracy 
of data and information reported in the CRR.
  LRQA’s responsibility is only to Chevron. LRQA disclaims any 
liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. Chevron’s management was responsible for preparing the CRR and for maintaining effective internal controls over the reporting processes and CRR. LRQA’s responsibility was to carry out an 
assurance engagement on the reporting processes in accordance 
with our contract with Chevron. Ultimately, the CRR has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of, Chevron.
LRQA’s Opinion
Based on LRQA’s approach, we believe that Chevron’s reporting proc-esses were  effective in delivering HES indicators that are useful for 
asses sing corporate performance and reporting information consistent 
with common reporting elements in the IPIECA/API/OGP  Oil and gas 
industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting  (2010). 
The opinion expr essed is formed on the basis of a reasonable level 
of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgment of the Verifier.

collection and checking processes.

Chevron Downstream and Chemicals headquarters in San Ramon, California, to assess  busin ess unit understanding and implementation

the United States, Shipping headquarters in the United States and one Chevron Oronite operation in France to assess  local understanding 
and implementation of Chevron’s HES reporting requirements.

of Chevron’s reporting requirements, including key persons responsible for drafting the CRR.
•  Reviewing Chevron’s documented reporting requirements to validate 
consistency of scope, definition and reporting requirements for each of the HES performance indicators.
