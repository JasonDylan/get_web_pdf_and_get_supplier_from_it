A LETTER FROM 
FREDERICK W. SMITH
CHAIRMAN, 
PRESIDENT  
AND CEOBecause we’re at the nexus of global trade, we have a major role in 
creating prosperity for millions of people. Because we are vitally 
integrated into the communities of 220 countries and territories 
around the world, FedEx keeps moving forward. Movement is at our core, as represented by the arrow in our FedEx logo. It’s a 
built-in symbol of our forward thinking, and we’re applying that to 
global citizenship activities in bigger and better ways.
FedEx global citizenship is about connecting 
the world responsibly and resourcefully. 
More than ever, we are aligning our citi -
zenship goals with our business goals—to create the most far-reaching, impactful 
programs possible.
Our business goals include stra  t egic acqui -
sitions, new hubs, and enhanced services 
to create a more profitable FedEx. But just 
as important, achieving such business 
goals strengthens the link between emerging 
economies and the global marketplace. We 
are creating social and economic ben  e fits 
for businesses from South Africa to South Korea. Growing our operations expands 
the possibilities for com  p anies of a few 
employees to those with thousands on  
the payroll.
Consider Nissan Mexico. Its plants in 
Mexican cities employ more than 20,000 
jobs that boost the economy. One of those, 
Aguascalientes, has far outpaced the 
growth of the Mexican national economy overall. The Aguascalientes plant sends 
out about 2,400 parts a day to locations such as Canada, Brazil, and Australia. 
FedEx is central to Nissan’s global supply 
chain and in particular to its on-time repair 
parts deliveries. By having a state-of-  
the-art hub in Mexico, we’re a key link  
in creating more wealth and personal  
prosperity for an entire area.
Here in the United States, FedEx has  
long-standing programs to help small and 
medium businesses navigate a complicated 
international regulatory environment. These 
programs help FedEx customers reach 
across oceans and continents to new  
markets. For instance, once companies participate in our ExporTech class—part  
of our Know and Grow
SM program—
research shows their sales can increase significantly in six to nine months.
We believe our commitment to global citi -
zenship underpins our long-term growth 
and profitability. Our fuel reductions contain costs and reduce emissions. Our 
diver  si ty efforts add team members with 
broader talents and perspectives. Our partic -
ipation in jet fuel alternatives research 
frames a future that may save money and 
the environment. Global citizenship can be 
a strong, long-term, competitive advantage.
We added a materiality assessment to our 
citizenship program in 2014. Materiality identifies how our most important corporate 
social responsibility issues overlap with our 
business objectives. Our assessment 
sought input from external audiences as 
well as our executives and many individual 
team members. Not surprisingly, our top 
issues center on operations, safety, and 
ethics; you can find out more about the 
results of this study in Mitch Jackson’s interview on page 5. We’ll keep a sharp focus on materiality to maximize the effects of all our citizenship efforts.
We continue to address challenges even 
as we make great strides. We promote 
FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT FEDEX 4
safety through programs such as the 
National Truck Driving Championship  
competition, in which FedEx drivers  
consistently win top spots; or through 
collab  o ration with organizations such as 
Safe Kids and the Com  m ercial Vehicle 
Safety Alliance. With respect to safety trends, we’re also working diligently to 
identify root causes and reduce preventable 
accidents. “Safety above all” has been a 
core FedEx belief since our inception.
No matter how smart our strategies may 
be, there can be no success without our 
people. FedEx team members move  
forward with commitment; they execute with precision; they create possibilities for 
the world. For every activity you read about  
in this report, there may be dozens or  
even hundreds of FedEx team members 
involved in each one. Their global citizenship 
work is truly inspirational. Listen to Sarah Farrell in our Corporate 
Contributions department, who visited 
Haiti right after that country’s earthquake 
five years ago and again last November:
“Disaster preparedness is in our DNA at 
FedEx. Few companies can reach places 
all over the world as quickly and efficiently 
as we can. Because our network allows us 
to get to places like Haiti that have been 
impacted by disaster, it’s our responsibility 
to use our resources and expertise to give back where we can.”
It’s that kind of insight and action that 
keeps FedEx moving forward and creating 
countless possibilities for our customers, team members, shareowners, and the world. 
FedEx will continue to have big ambitions 
for our global citizenship strat  e gy and work 
hard to achieve our goals. We’re pleased 
with our progress but never satisfied.Sincerely,
Frederick W. Smith
Chairman,  
President and CEO
MORE THAN EVER, WE ARE ALIGNING 
OUR CITIZENSHIP GOALS WITH OUR 
BUSINESS GOALS—TO CREATE THE 
MOST FAR-REACHING, IMPACT  F UL 
PROGRAMS POSSIBLE.

Q&A WITH MITCH JACKSON
VICE PRESIDENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS  
AND SUSTAINABILITY FEDEX CORPORATION
WHAT GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ACHIEVEMENTS  
ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF?WHAT CHALLENGES DO YOU FACE IN ACHIEVING YOUR  
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS?
Our people are at the heart of FedEx. When you look at what our 
team members do in moving possibilities for our customers and communities, it’s hard not to marvel at their dedication, strengths, diverse backgrounds and impact around the world. FedEx
® Fuel 
Sense team members have, for example, helped us save more than 334 million gallons of jet fuel since 2007, which equals 3.25 million metric tons of carbon emissions avoided, in addition to the economic savings. And our FedEx Express Vehicles team is within a half of a percentage point of our goal on vehicle fuel efficiency, five years ahead of schedule.
Our logistics expertise applies beyond our core business and benefits 
communities and stakeholders the world over. We’re the logistical backbone for Orbis and its Flying Eye Hospitals. We work with EMBARQ to develop smart public transportation systems in growing mega-cities. We support legislation to reduce environmental and societal impacts of the transportation industry. And these are just a few examples. It’s tough to pinpoint only a few areas of the transfor -
mative work we are doing, so I encourage you to read on and learn more about the breadth and scope of our activities.We have big ambitions. We set a strong goal to obtain 30 percent of our aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2030. One challenge 
we face is aligning our aspirations with the realities of cost competi -
tiveness and available supply. Many smart, dedicated people are working on developing liquid fuels from biomass, but it is not  
currently available in volumes that are economically viable or meet commercial needs.
This obstacle is not unlike those that we face related to other business 
goals. Smart collaboration and unrelenting focus, clarity and execution will help to overcome these challenges. For example, we are working with several organizations, including the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative and The Nature Conservancy to support the development of sustainable alternatives to jet fuel.
CLIMATE CHANGE, URBANIZATION AND GLOBALIZATION ARE 
JUST A FEW OF THE ISSUES FACING OUR WORLD TODAY. HOW 
DOES GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP HELP FEDEX TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING MARKETPLACE?
At the most basic level, we serve our customers by providing high-value-
added logistics, transportation and related business services. And we do so day in and day out to the very best of our abilities. We strive to make every customer experience outstanding—what we call the “Purple Promise.” But beyond moving packages from point A to point B, we also connect the world—and we aim to do so responsibly and resourcefully. This means minimizing impacts on the environment  
and congestion, improving the safety of streets in cities around the world, utilizing our infrastructure to provide disaster relief and linking people to thriving markets and economies.FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT FEDEX 6
FEDEX RECENTLY CONDUCTED A MATERIALITY  
ASSESSMENT. WILL THE RESULTS IMPACT THE 
COMPANY’S GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP STRATEGY?WHAT INSIGHTS WERE GAINED THROUGH  
THE MATERIALITY PROCESS?
In a word, yes. Materiality is a requirement for the Global Reporting 
Initiative G4 framework, but its value is much greater than that. If 
we were simply undertaking this process to satisfy a reporting 
requirement without using it to strengthen our approach, it would be 
like assembling the ingredients of a good meal without actually  
preparing and enjoying it.
By and large, the results of the materiality assessment reconfirmed 
our current global citizenship strategy and indicated that we are 
already focusing on those issues that are material for us. But the 
process shed light on places where we might improve our focus 
across the enterprise. In the next year, we plan to again reevaluate our goals and metrics in our top material issues to ensure we are measuring and managing what really matters, and having a meaningful impact wherever we can.External stakeholder feedback was particularly enlightening. Broadly 
speaking, external stakeholders placed more importance on mitigating 
risks, such as greenhouse gas emissions, than seizing opportunities 
related to global citizenship through product and solution innovation. 
We feel both are important, however. Additionally, the views and 
values of external stakeholders are not always aligned. This underscores 
the importance of targeted, issues-based engagement with certain 
stakeholder groups, and is the impetus for our plan to increase our 
external engagement efforts moving forward.
What all of this leads to, as I stated last year, is that FedEx is built on  
the belief that local economic growth requires connectivity with the 
rest of the world, and we accept that it is our role and responsibility to do this sustainably.SUSTAINABILITY Q&A CONT.
MATERIALITY AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
In 2014, we undertook a robust materiality  
analysis to help us refine our global citizenship 
strategy and ensure that we are addressing areas of maximum impact. The outcomes of the analysis have helped us to reaffirm, evaluate and prioritize our top material issues at each operating company, as well as across the enter -
prise. In addition to informing and helping refine our strategy, materiality will help us continue  
to enhance the relevance of our reporting in  
the future.
To conduct a truly objective assessment, we 
worked with an external business and sustain -
ability advisory firm to create a highly customized methodology tailored to our company’s unique structure. We greatly value the perspectives of our stakeholders and worked to ensure that they were 
part of the process. Our assessment comprised:
•  A series of discussions with key external 
stakeholders representing nongovernmental organizations, academics and media, as well as our customers and business partners who were asked both prompted and unprompted questions about their views of environmental, social and ethical issues that represent the greatest risks and opportunities for FedEx.
•
  I nternal stakeholder engagement with executives.
•  W orkshops at each operating company with 
cross-functional subject matter experts.
•  A n employee survey.
•  A f inal enterprise-level workshop to refine and 
confirm the materiality results.GLOBAL 
CITIZENSHIP STRATEGYGlobal citizenship is key to our business success and is central to 
our Purple Promise. In everything we do, we are committed to moving  
possibilities forward for our customers every day, and doing so in a safe, ethical and sustainable way.
Global economic growth relies on an interconnected world. Our 
Economic Development section of this report describes in detail 
how citizenship helps us move possibilities by increasing efficiency, 
advancing new business opportunities and mitigating risks. Our  
citizenship strategy is designed to support these business objectives 
by allowing our operating companies to take a tailored approach 
based on their unique needs and capabilities within the larger objectives  
set by the enterprise.

MATERIALITY RESULTS
Our materiality assessment confirmed that our 
greatest impacts, opportunities and challenges are directly related to our operations. The above matrix illustrates a wide range of different issues we face that are critical to our global citi -
zenship. Performing well on these issues means creating efficiencies and encouraging innovation in our operations and service offerings while upholding the Purple Promise.
As we expected, our top issues focus on oper -
ations, safety and ethics. When our team members 
are knowledgeable, safe and trustworthy, they are able to focus on delivering our Purple Promise to customers. At the right, we provide some highlights on the progress we have made on many of our key material issues:•
  E missions from our transportation fleet and 
operations are among our greatest areas of impact, and we continue to drive toward industry-leading practices in this area.
•
  W orkplace safety continues to be a top area of 
focus for us, and we are continually striving to improve our track record. We recognize that our people are at the center of everything we do and invest in our team member relations and workforce development.
•
  I nnovation in our products and services helps 
us drive new business opportunities and reduce our use of natural resources like paper and fuel, while delivering for our customers.•
  O ur business preparedness efforts enable 
FedEx to operate reliably and responsibly in the communities we serve, even when diffi -
culties or disasters arise.
•
  A s a crucial player in many of our customers’ 
supply chains, our operational excellence helps ensure that our customers’ businesses are stable and more sustainable. For this reason, we focus our own supply chain efforts on more sustainable purchasing and EarthSmart
® programs to drive 
sustainability beyond our operations.
•  W e also expanded our Code of Conduct this 
year to reflect our commitment to protecting and advancing human rights in all of our operations.FEDEX ENTERPRISE MATERIALITY MATRIX

MOVING FORWARD
We view materiality as an iterative process that 
must be periodically reviewed and refined as our business and the marketplace evolve. In 2015, we plan to increase our issues-based stakeholder engagement in our analysis. We also plan to again review our goals and metrics around our top material issues to ensure that we are constantly measuring, managing and  moving possibilities in our global citizenship progress.

BENEFITING STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH 
STRONG BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
In FY14, FedEx revenue grew by 3 percent and 
our operating margin rose to 7.6 percent. The 
economic activity generated by such a large 
and complex enterprise creates possibilities for a wide range of stakeholders in many 
countries, including customers, shareholders, 
team members, suppliers and communities. (page 14)GROWING A GLOBAL  
MARKETPLACE
As we expand our regional services, more people, communities and businesses are 
connected to the global economy. In 2014,  
we opened multiple facilities including our 
new North Pacific Regional Hub at Kansai 
International Airport in Osaka, Japan, a FedEx 
Express distribution center in Mexico, and the 100th new FedEx Express station in Europe. 
(page 18)2014 Highlights
HUMAN NATURE:  
CREATING GROWTH IN THE PHILIPPINES
The goal of Human Nature, a Filipino personal 
care products company, was simple: establish 
a social enterprise to help Filipino communi -
ties in a sustainable way. Realizing that high 
shipping costs were causing inter  n ational 
 customers to abandon their online purchases, 
Human Nature turned to FedEx for a fast, 
 reliable and cost-effective shipping solution. 
International business has doubled for the 
company since leveraging the FedEx network, 
creating local jobs for people in under  p rivileged 
communities in the Philippines. (page 17)Case StudySUPPORTING OPEN  
AND EFFICIENT TRADE
FedEx works around the world to reduce red 
tape, improve border efficiency and stream  l ine 
rules and regulations for customers. 2014 
marked the 10-year anniversary of the collabo -
ration between FedEx Global Marketing and the U.S. Commercial Service, which resulted  
in the trade education program “FedEx Know and Grow
SM.” Companies that attended 
ExporTech, a component of FedEx Know and 
Grow, report an average increase in sales of 
$770,000–$900,000 in six to nine months after completion. (page 21)

ENTREPRENEURS OF FY14
FedEx Ground has always contracted exclu -
sively with independent businesses for over-
the-road transportation, pickup and delivery services. This business model has consistently provided customers with the industry’s best service while enabling thousands of entrepreneurs to own and grow independent businesses.
Every year, FedEx Ground celebrates this 
dynamic with an award recognizing those busi -
nesses that best demonstrate a commitment to business growth and development, customer service, safety and community involvement. The FY14 Entrepreneurs of the Year are Jason Brooks (of Brooksy, Inc., Bangor, Maine), Saul Lerma (of Lerma Transport, Inc., Yuma, Arizona) and Jack Webster (of 6748067 Manitoba, Inc., Winnipeg, Canada).8,200

SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESS GOALS
Our global citizenship program is closely aligned with our business 
goals, supporting our business by increasing efficiency, advancing 
opportunities and mitigating risks.
INCREASING 
EFFICIENCY2.1 The operating cost of our business is significantly affected by major expenditures, 
including aviation and vehicle fuel, facility energy, tires and other vehicle main -
tenance items, paper and packaging materials. Every item we purchase has  
an environmental impact associated with its production and use, so the more  
efficiently we consume resources, the less environmental impact we cause.  
And with environmental impact reductions, we in turn achieve cost savings.
Aircraft and vehicle fuel consumption, for  
example, accounts for more than 90 percent of 
our total reported CO 2e footprint, and fuel  
costs represent almost 11 percent of our total operating expenses. Similarly, our waste  
reduction and recycling program achieves both environmental and financial benefits.
We estimate the total cost savings to our  
business from fuel efficiency to be almost $370 million in FY14. The true figure is likely to be 
larger, since we do not capture data for many other items also targeted by our efficiency programs.
The synergy between business and envi -
ronmental objectives enables us to set robust efficiency targets, backed by major capital investments in a modernized aircraft fleet and fuel efficient, alternative fuel road vehicles, for example.2FEDEX 15

ADVANCING 
OPPORTUNITIES2.2 Today, both business customers and consumers increasingly make purchasing 
decisions in favor of companies that reflect their values.
At FedEx, we aim to connect the world respon -
sibly and resourcefully. Our portfolio of services 
is designed to help customers of all sizes reach new markets and realize new opportunities.  
Our EarthSmart Solutions further improve the efficiency of these business transactions by minimizing environmental impacts. Beyond our service offerings, we also invest in communities 
to promote resiliency, safety and sustainability. 
These efforts are central to establishing our 
good reputation and moving possibilities  
forward for our company, customers and the 
communities in which we operate.It is not easy to quantify the total value to FedEx 
of a good reputation in global citizenship, but we are convinced it is important and will be even more so in the future. We track the inquiries we receive from enterprise customers, analysts and investors seeking details of our global citizenship work and performance.In FY13 and FY14, we responded to numerous 
requests for information about corporate citizenship 
and provided carbon emissions data to many of our 
customers. In total, we estimate that the FY14 
revenue from such customers was $6.8 billion.FEDEX 16 FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
MITIGATING 
RISKS2.3 Global citizenship also plays a key role in mitigating risks and exploiting opportu -
nities from social and environmental issues and trends.
Our internal risk-management system provides 
common frameworks and policies for the oper -
ating companies to manage financial and other material business risks, including citizenship issues. Responsible management and long-  
term planning throughout our operations help us to avoid adverse impacts on revenue, costs, 
reputation and business continuity.
Details of the citizenship risks most material to 
FedEx and how they are mitigated appears below.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
The ability to send and receive packages is key to reaping the  
benefits from a digitally connected world.
In the developed world, we take for granted the 
sophisticated infrastructure for sending and receiving packages quickly and efficiently over large distances to any location. But in many emerging countries, efficient logistics networks are just being established. The economic  
potential of the internet combined with our ability to move packages through the FedEx global  
network creates new possibilities for millions of people in emerging countries. By linking over  
90 percent of the world’s GDP with an efficient 
and dependable logistics network, FedEx is 
facilitating the growth of global entrepreneurship 
through trade.
In the United States, FedEx solutions for entre -
preneurs, small and diverse businesses are 
helping these ventures access global markets 
and benefit their local communities as they grow.3
FEDEX SUPPORTS NISSAN’S EXPANSION IN MEXICO
Nissan Mexico’s plants in Aguascalientes  
have helped make the company—and the  
country—a worldwide auto manufacturing 
leader. They’ve also made deep and lasting changes in a local community.
A new 21 million-square-foot plant, together with 
an older facility, employs more than 8,700 workers. They run 23 hours per day, six days per week and are relentlessly productive—a new car rolls 
off their lines every 38 seconds. Addi  t ional 
plants in Cuernavaca enabled Nissan Mex  i co to 
build more than 850,000 vehicles in 2014.
GDP growth in Aguascalientes has far outpaced 
the Mexican national economy, in part due to the  
12,000 direct and indirect jobs created by the A2 plant’s opening in 2013. The State Government of Aguascalientes estimates that auto industry- related projects created another 19,000 new jobs and generated more than $36 million in direct investments between 2011 and 2014.
The FedEx global network is essential to the 
successful operation of Nissan Mexico. Nissan Mexico is a key global parts distribution hub, and on an average day the Aguascalientes plant sends out close to 2,400 parts to destinations in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and as far away as Australia.
As Nissan Mexico has continually boosted its 
output in recent years, the aftermarket operation has grown in both scope and complexity. FedEx plays a major role in Nissan's global supply chain and is also central to its global on-time repair parts deliveries.

When Human Nature founders Dylan Wilk, Anna 
Meloto-Wilk and Camille Meloto started the business in 2008, they had a simple goal:  
establish a social enterprise to help Filipino communities in a sustainable way. The three imagined running a business for profit while still advocating social development. Human Nature’s business philosophy is pro-poor, pro-Philippines and pro-environment.
They began selling natural, yet affordable  
personal care products using many raw materials 
that are grown in the Philippines. The company trains and employs underprivileged residents from local communities to support their operations. By 2014, Human Nature achieved a loyal Filipino customer base and was also attracting interest from all over the world via its website.
Business Development Manager Dia Lacaba 
explained: “We noticed that many international customers trying to purchase our products online abandon their carts when they reached the shipping fee page due to high shipping costs.”
Human Nature looked to FedEx for a fast,  
reliable and cost-effective solution. With access to the FedEx network of over 220 countries  
and territories, their international business has 
more than doubled in 2014 compared with the previous year.
Helping Human Nature expand its international 
business also has a positive impact on the  
company’s pro-poor advocacy. As it grows, Human Nature hires more employees from underprivileged communities and the company recently opened a new manufacturing plant in Laguna whose workforce is composed mostly of residents from the area.

GROWING A GLOBAL 
MARKETPLACE3.1 As we expand our regional services, more people, communities and businesses  
are connected to the global economy. In FY15, FedEx Express split the Europe, 
Middle East and Asia (EMEA) region into two distinct regional organizations, a move that recognizes broader service offerings and greater growth opportunities in those areas of the world. Below is a summary of progress in FY14:
ASIA PACIFIC
FedEx continued its investment in Asia Pacific, 
expanding the reach and range of services in the region. In May 2014, following a pledge by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to “open the market in China more widely, making the logistics  
environment more fair and competitive,” FedEx was awarded domestic express permits that completed the permitting process for our China network of 56 branches. China’s State Council also confirmed that China’s parcel delivery sector would be “fully opened up” so the country  
can “create a fair and competitive business environment in which domestic and foreign-  
financed enterprises receive equal treatment.”
CHINA EXPANSION
In July 2013, we announced the expansion  
of our operations facility at Beijing Capital  
Inter  n ational Airport. The upgraded facility is 
nearly four times the size of the previous one. Sorting capacity is nearly four times greater with a capacity of up to 6,000 packages per hour. With the latest technology, the expanded facility enables faster deliveries for customers in 16 major cities in northern China.
In Shanghai, we expect to open a new  
International Express and Cargo facility in 2017 at Pudong International Airport that will more than 
triple the capacity of the current FedEx facility. 
The 134,000-square-meter integrated FedEx 
facility will offer on-site customs clearance and 
process up to 36,000 packages per hour. The new 
facility will provide faster and more reliable access 
to Asia for our U.S. and European customers.
SATURDAY PICK-UP SERVICES IN CHINA
FedEx has further strengthened its FedEx  
International Economy® and FedEx International 
Economy® Freight services, offering Saturday 
pick-up for customers in China. With the same 
FedEx speed and reliability, the Saturday pick-up service gives customers greater flexibility when preparing outbound shipments. 
NORTH PACIFIC REGIONAL HUB
In April 2014, we opened our new North Pacific Regional Hub at Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan. The new facility has the capacity to sort up to 9,000 packages per hour. In addition to handling international cargo for the Western Japan region, it also serves as a consolidation and transshipment point between Asia and  
the United States, giving customers greater access to and from markets in Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Europe. We also added a new route to Indianapolis, Ind., to the existing direct flight routes to the United States.FEDEX 18 FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

sition, we focused on strengthening domestic transportation and supply chain capabilities to meet the demands of Indian businesses. FedEx now offers end-to-end logistics solutions, including international and domestic air express services, domestic ground services, warehousing and supply chain management.
LAUNCHED EXPANDED DIRECT PRIORITY OCEAN 
SOLUTIONS IN INDIA
In September 2013, FedEx Trade Networks, our 
freight forwarding arm, announced the launch of an end-to-end ocean shipping solution for India, from four cities: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. The new service extends the reach  
of the specialized ocean service and provides  
customers who export to the United States with additional ocean freight forwarding options.FEDEX ACQUIRES SUPASWIFT BUSINESSES IN

These 2014 acquisitions represent the latest 
step in the company’s strategy to grow its African network and service offering. FedEx Express is offering a complete suite of export, import and domestic solutions across southern Africa, connecting the region to more than  
220 countries and territories worldwide, enhancing customers’ business flexibility and speed to market.
FedEx now has direct access across seven 
southern African countries utilizing 40 facilities and over 1,000 team members.

SUPPORTING U.S. SMALL AND 
MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES
FedEx helps U.S. businesses of all sizes access global and national 
markets. Small businesses looking to expand into global markets 
often lack knowledge of regulations governing international trade. 
FedEx has developed significant expertise in trade regulations, supply chain management and logistics that can help small businesses 
succeed in the global marketplace. We work with agencies like the 
U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. Commercial Service to support the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
and offer targeted programs to help our customers compete.4
HELPING SMALL 
U.S. BUSINESSES GO GLOBAL4.1
FedEx has long-standing programs in place to help our small- and medium-sized 
business customers navigate complex regulatory environments. Programs like FedEx Know and Grow and Export University provide resources and skills that equip our customers to do business internationally.
As regulations change, FedEx assists customers 
by collaborating with regulatory agencies  
to provide over 100 education events and  
programs throughout the year. The FedEx Know and Grow program is a suite of annual events, seminars and other training opportunities across the U.S. providing export education to our  
customers. Learning programs target the main exporting growth hurdles: finding the right  
markets, regulatory complexity and international finance/risk mitigation. Opportunities in the 
NAFTA Region and the e-Commerce channel 
are two areas highlighted to foster successful 
business growth. Since the program’s inception 
in 2009, more than 72,500 businesses have 
benefited, including about 7,500 in FY14.  
Companies that attended ExporTech, a  
component of FedEx Know and Grow, report an 
average increase in sales of $770,000–
$900,000 in six to nine months after completion.FEDEX 21 FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

MANN LAKE FIGHTS AGAINST COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER
Founded and headquartered in Hackensack, a town 
of about 300 people in north-central Min  n esota, 
Mann Lake Ltd. is the world’s largest supplier of beekeeping equipment. That puts the company on the front lines of a critical environmental threat. By some estimates, the phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has wiped out more than 10 million beehives—worth an estimated $2 billion—in the U.S. since 2006. The potential long-term consequences are alarming, as roughly one-third of the human diet comes from insect-pollinated plants,  
and honeybees account for 80 percent of that 
pollination, according to the U.S. Depart  m ent  
of Agriculture.
Mann Lake’s founders, Jack and Betty Thomas, 
had no idea their business would one day play a role in the fight against CCD. Three decades ago, the husband and wife were hobbyist bee -
keepers. But Jack sensed opportunity in the beekeeping industry. “I saw areas that needed more technology to help beekeepers with new ideas,” he says.Their customer base now includes both hobbyists and commercial beekeepers. What started as a two-person, home-based operation has developed into a global business. A total of 350 people now work for Mann Lake. Most are in Hackensack, building hives, producing feed and developing mite control chemicals and delivery systems. The rest work at distribution centers in California and Pennsylvania, and at a newly opened  
center in England. The location of its Minnesota headquarters, far from urban areas of any size, doesn’t impede delivery and distribution—the company relies on a combination of FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight to get its products to beekeepers and distributors.

DIVERSE SUPPLIERS4.3 FedEx has promoted the use of small businesses and those owned by women or 
minorities throughout our supply chain for over two decades. Supplier diversity is overseen by our enterprise-wide Sourcing Organization. Its leadership team reviews our operating companies’ sourcing processes to ensure that supplier diversity efforts align with our overall sourcing strategy.

Winners were chosen based on their applications and plans to use the grant funding, with some weight given to an online voting process where consumers and other visitors supported applicants by voting once per day during the contest period. In 2014, Fat Toad Farm, which sells artisanal goat’s milk caramel sauces, took home the grand prize of $25,000. FedEx will continue this effort in 2015 and we anticipate awarding a total of $75,000

OPEN AND EFFICIENT TRADE4.4
Open trade between countries promotes stronger economic growth and higher 
standards of living, whereas trade restrictions and inefficient borders hinder the global economy. That is why FedEx advocates for trade policies and agreements that remove barriers to trade and simplify international business.
The complexity of divergent regulatory systems creates bottlenecks to transatlantic 
trade. For example, the U.S. and EU each have rules that create obstacles for small- and medium-sized businesses attempting to trade across the Atlantic. Additional customs red tape, registration requirements and duplicate safety certifications mean that many SMEs miss out on export opportunities.
FedEx works around the world to reduce red 
tape, improve border efficiency and streamline 
rules and regulations for our customers. Influ -
encing trade rules requires broad collaboration and we engage with government agencies and business organizations to advocate on behalf of our small- and medium-sized customers.
Trade benefits all economies, but it is especially 
important for emerging countries that want to access global markets to support small  
business growth, provide employment and 
investment and improve the standard of living 
for their people. By actively promoting pro-trade 
policies, FedEx is moving possibilities forward 
for the greater social and economic good.
The following are the key initiatives we pursued 
through industry and government engagement 
in FY14.
FedEx has long-standing programs in place to help our small- and medium-sized business  
customers navigate complex regulatory envi -
ronments. FedEx Global Marketing recently  
celebrated our 10-year anniversary of an  
alli ance with the U.S. Commercial Service.  This collaboration has resulted in the trade 
education program “FedEx Know and Grow,” which supports over 100 education events and programs throughout the year. See page 21 for more details.FEDEX KNOW AND GROW TRADE EDUCATIONFEDEX 24 FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

U.S. Highway Trust Fund, which threatens to undermine our already crumbling infrastructure. Dilapidated roads and bridges impact our  
customers and the U.S. economy. We are also urging policymakers to adopt innovative ways to enhance productivity, such as advocating for the allowable trailer length to be extended from 28' to 33' when used in a twin-trailer configuration.
The FedEx PAC focused efforts in support of 
free trade agreements and pressed Congress  
to commit to long-term investment in transpor -

OVERVIEW At FedEx, we believe that we can decrease our 
environmental footprint while simultaneously 
expanding our business—and the data backs 
that up. This year, we’ve continued to reduce our emissions even as our revenue and the 
number of items we deliver has gone up.
With 650 airplanes and more than 100,000 owned and contracted vehicles in our fleet, as well as around 5,000 facilities globally, it 
makes economic as well as environmental sense for us to reduce our fuel, energy and 
materials use. We look for solutions that 
make a difference today, like upgrading to more fuel-efficient aircraft and vehicles, 
and installing more solar panels to gener -
ate clean power for our facilities where 
practical. At the same time, we invest in 
the development of future environmental 
solutions such as alternative fuels and advanced technologies, and advocate for 
changes that could impact and improve the 
efficiency and environmental performance of our entire industry. Through our EarthSmart
® program, we 
encourage and recognize innovative initiatives 
to improve our environmental performance, 
engage our team members and customers and inspire others. Many initiatives described 
in this report have been designated as an 
EarthSmart Innovation, EarthSmart@Work or EarthSmart Outreach program. 
We’ve made great progress again this year 
and are on track to meet our environmental 
goals. But we're not about to rest on our laurels. Each year, we challenge ourselves 
to seek new possibilities, lead by example  
and continue the momentum toward a 
more sustainable future.The transportation industry accounts for 
less than 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.* Although FedEx 
con t ributes only a very small part to that, 
our company’s reach extends across many 
industries throughout the globe. That’s 
why, as we continually strive to improve 
our own performance, we reach back to involve and inspire our customers, suppli -
ers, peers, government and other stake -
holders. We can achieve more for FedEx, for our industry and for the climate by 
working together.

FUEL, ENERGY AND  
CLIMATE CHANGE
Moving packages and freight via aircraft and ground vehicles for 
customers around the world—our main operating activity—unavoidably 
results in fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions.
The principal source of our emissions is jet fuel, 
followed by diesel fuel in company-owned  
vehicles at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight. We are committed to cutting these emissions year over year. We continue to set and meet 
ambitious goals to reduce our carbon footprint 
and decouple economic growth from our direct 
and indirect emissions.FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ENVIRONMENT FEDEX 31

FEDEX FUEL SENSE: FINDING EFFICIENCIES
Fuel efficiency is a top priority at FedEx. Our 
FedEx Fuel Sense team—comprised of expert representatives from 12 departments, including our dedicated Fuel Management Office—is charged with identifying efficiencies across our aviation operations. One of this year’s initiatives used innovative data analysis tools to identify small changes that could be made to the engine wash process to improve the engine’s perfor -
mance and help it operate more efficiently. This saved us 3.4 million gallons of fuel and 33,134 metric tons of CO
2e emissions in FY14. We  
also ask all team members who work with our aircraft to adopt a fuel-efficient mindset and search out innovative ways to help us save fuel. A suggestion by one crew member to change the routing on one of our flights saved us 9,000 gallons of fuel this year.Seven new FedEx Fuel Sense programs were launched in 2014. They included developing algorithms that better predict the amount of fuel needed to taxi based on the parking gate and departure runway; reducing the weight we fly by transitioning to lighter containers and replacing pilots' paper manuals with electronic ones (see Lightening the Load, below); and optimizing 
departure and arrival pro  c edures and separation 
standards in ongoing collaboration with the 
Federal Aviation Admin  i stration (FAA) (see 
Creating Efficiencies with the FAA, page 35). 
Since its inception in 2007, the FedEx Fuel 
Sense ini  t iative has saved us from using more 
than 334 million gallons of jet fuel and has 
avoided more than 3.25 million metric tons of CO
2e emissions.THANKS TO 46 ACTIVE

The heavier the aircraft, the more fuel is needed 
for it to fly. That’s why we’re always looking for ways to reduce the weight we carry on our flights. This year, two new FedEx Fuel Sense initiatives helped us take some weight off our wings.After three years of planning, designing and 
testing more than 100 units on 21,000 flights, in 
FY14 we introduced three models of FedEx 
Efficient Container units, which keep our cus -
tomers’ packages safe during loading, transit 
and unloading of our aircraft. We estimate that 
once all 23,000 older containers are replaced, 
these new containers will annually remove 
more than 1.25 million lbs. from our air network, 
save around 2.4 million gallons of fuel and 
reduce CO
2e emissions by 22,729 metric tons. 
The units are also 100 percent recyclable.
In our second weight-saving initiative, we 
exchanged the paper versions of the manuals and navigation charts we are required to carry on each flight with electronic versions. We’ve distributed more than 4,300 iPads to our pilots, and removed 32 tons of paper from our planes. This will save around 370,000 gallons of jet fuel and avoid 3,572 metric tons of CO
2e annually.LIGHTENING THE LOAD

tigates opportunities to safely reduce distances between flight tracks at takeoff using what's called a stack departure approach. During high-  
traffic periods, departing flights  
are separated vertically, rather than horizontally, to shorten flight tracks and reduce fuel use.We updated this 2013 success and developed new procedures at Memphis to manage newly allowed departures from closely spaced runways. As a result of our work with the FAA, the agency has implemented the first phase of these new standards at Louisville, Ky., and Atlanta, Ga.,  
and now plans on doing the same  
at airports with similar runway  
con f igurations, such as Newark, N.J.We continue to land 60 percent of flights into Memphis in the most  
efficient way possible. And we’re  
now working with the FAA on further enhancements to determine the optimal point to start the descent, which we hope to start implementing in 2015.KEY INITIATIVE #2

identify yet more solutions. In addition, the agency's use of our Memphis, Tenn., hub as a case study over the years has yielded several initiatives that have brought positive change to the entire industry.
FedEx savings: 321,000 gallons of jet fuel 
and 3,000 metric tons of CO

in FY14.
MODERNIZING OUR AIRCRAFT FLEET
FedEx continues to replace older-model planes 
with more fuel-efficient aircraft. For example, by operating Boeing 757F models—which consume 36 percent less fuel and have 20 percent more capacity than the older Boeing 727F models—we avoided almost 200,000 metric tons of CO
2e 
emissions in FY14. We're also replacing MD-10 airplanes with the 30 percent more efficient Boeing 767F aircraft, and MD-11s with 18 percent more efficient Boeing 777F models. In total, our more efficient fleet saved 29.5 million gallons  
of jet fuel and avoided 281,803 metric tons of CO
2e emissions in FY14.In FY14, eight retired aircraft were donated to institutions, including three international deliver -
ies for use in airframe & powerplant certified training programs: Don Bosco University in San Salvador, the Trinidad & Tobago Civil Aviation Authority and Anadolu University in Turkey. Previous donations included to organizations such as the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, the National Museum of Commercial Aviation, and Orbis International, which repur -
posed the plane as a transportable eye hospital and teaching facility.FEDEX 35 FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ENVIRONMENT
GOAL
Obtain 30% of our jet fuel from  
alternative fuels by the year 2030
PROGRESS
FedEx is actively engaged with the 
Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative (CAAFI), the American Society for Testing and Materials 
(ASTM) International, the Nature 
Conservancy, the U.S. Departments of Energy and Agriculture and other stakeholders in developing viable sustainable alternatives to petroleum- 
based jet fuel. Developing a sustainable  
jet fuel product that can be produced at scale and transported to where it’s needed at a competitive price is a 
challenge that can only be solved by 
working together with our industry peers, academia, governmental  
agencies and companies in the  
alternative fuel supply chain, including refineries and distributors.FEDEX 36 FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ENVIRONMENT
GOAL
Increase FedEx Express vehicle fuel 
efficiency 30% from a 2005 baseline by 2020
PROGRESS
In 2014, FedEx Express further improved fuel efficiency by 2.5%, bringing its cumulative improvement from 2005 levels to 29.5%. In FY15, 
we plan to revisit this goal in light of 
the progress to date.VEHICLE EMISSIONS 1.5 After our jet fleet, company-owned vehicles at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight 
are the second-largest contributor to our Scope 1 emissions. Vehicles operated by FedEx Ground contracted service providers account for most of our reported Scope 3 emissions. All of our operating companies employ strategies to improve the fuel efficiency of their vehicle fleets, and this year we continued to achieve overall vehicle emissions reductions in our company-owned fleet.
FLEET UPGRADES
An important way to reduce our vehicle emissions is to upgrade to cleaner, more efficient  
vehicles with engines that are optimally sized for the weight and power needed. For example, 
FedEx Office replaced 177 of its less efficient local pickup and delivery vehicles with more  
efficient Ford Transit Connects during FY14, saving around 68,443 gallons of fuel and 626 metric tons of CO
2e emissions.
At FedEx Express:
•  We u sed state-of-the-art on-road analysis to 
determine that we could use smaller, more 
efficient engines in class 8 tractors, improving fuel economy by 8–12 percent. 
•
  W e increased the number of high-efficiency 
Isuzu Reach vans in the U.S. by 1,700 this year. These vehicles are lighter and have smaller engines, allowing them to be 35–50 percent more efficient than the vehicles they replace. 
•
  We a dded 24 new hybrid-electric vehicles, 
171 electric vehicles and 10 compressed natu -
ral gas (CNG) Chevy vans to the U.S. fleet this year. We will be able to determine efficiency improvements for these vehicles once they have been in the fleet for more than six months. •
  W e replaced more than 450 vehicles in Brazil 
with more efficient models, including six elec -
tric vehicles, since last year.
•  We r educed fuel consumption on certain 
Caribbean routes by an average of 20 percent by replacing older vehicles with Toyota HiAce diesel trucks.The FedEx Express 
approach to reducing 
vehicle emissions  
has three aims:REPLACE
Upgrade vehicles to 
more efficient ones wherever possibleREDUCE
Optimize routing and driving habits to reduce mileage and fuel useREVOLUTIONIZE
Identify and invest in future technologies such as alternative fuel, hybrid-electric and electric vehicles
FEDEX 37 FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ENVIRONMENT
EXPLORING FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES
New products have to be extensively tested in 
the field, refined and tested again before they can be widely adopted. At FedEx, we're proud to be a leader in developing and testing alternative fuel and energy technologies. For example:
•
  F edEx Freight is testing the long-term  
performance and longevity of tractors fueled 
with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and  
compressed natural gas (CNG).
•  F edEx Express has been developing a fuel 
station to test hydrogen-fuel-cell cargo tow tractors at the Memphis airport. 
•
  F edEx Office is exploring the suitability of CNG 
for local pick-up and delivery fleet operations.
We invest and participate in projects that advance the development of electric vehicles and their supporting infrastructure, which we strongly believe can make a significant positive contribution toward lessening the transportation sector’s environmental impact. For example, FedEx Express has been testing the Nissan e-NV200 EV prototype vehicle in Europe, Japan, Singapore and Brazil. In addition, FedEx Express has almost completed a three-year project in lower Manhattan with General Electric, Con Edison and Columbia University to demonstrate the feasibility of electric vehicle charging in large numbers. This research assessed the  
feasibility of using energy use history to  
predict future need, and therefore mitigate demand charging. A second research project in Manhattan was designed to minimize the costs of installing charging stations. Early indicators show success in both areas. The next stage  
of the research project is to look at ways of moving to automatic and remote control over the charging stations.

CONTRACTED SERVICE PROVIDERS 
MAKE FUEL-EFFICIENT CHOICES
FedEx Ground provides contracted service  
providers with information on resources and 
benefits of alternative fuel technology, such as state incentives, through summits and the  
sustainability section of its website. Its fueling stations also offer blends of biodiesel fuel, which are better for the environment.
VEHICLE IMPROVEMENTS
Alongside our alternative fuel efforts, we're focused on operating our existing conventional vehicles at peak efficiency. In FY14, FedEx Express invested in electronic diagnostic equip -
ment for every one of its maintenance shops in the United States. This technology will increase vehicle reliability, reduce downtime and ensure that all systems—including emissions systems—  
are functioning optimally.
At FedEx Freight, continuing to install trailer 
skirts and automatic transmissions were key factors in improving efficiency by 2 percent in FY14. Now 48 percent of the fleet is equipped 
with trailer skirts (minimizing drag), and 40  
percent of vehicles have an automatic transmission 
(for optimal shifting), which saves fuel.
FedEx Ground has been working with several 
vendors to test aerodynamics technology  
specifically designed for drop-frame trailers. These 
innovations could deliver savings of 5 percent in 
fuel use and more than 70,000 metric tons of 
CO
2e emissions per year if applied across its 
long-haul fleet of drop-frame trailers.
ADVOCATING FOR CHANGE 
Sometimes the changes we want to make to reduce emissions are not possible in every market. When we see possibilities that are not being realized, we advocate for change. For example, in the U.S., we started lobbying for improved fuel efficiency standards for commercial vehicles in 2007—and in 2014, these new regulations 
became effective. Our Vice Pres  i dent of 
Environmental Affairs and Sustainability described the efforts that led to this great result on the FedEx blog .
Currently in the U.S., FedEx is advocating for the allowable trailer length to be extended from 28' to 33' when used in a twin-trailer configuration. This would enable about 18 percent more freight to be hauled on the same trip, significantly 
reducing the number of trucks on the road,  
the amount of fuel used and greenhouse gas 
emissions—while maintaining the same high 
safety standards.optimal

MOVING TO MORE RAIL
Moving freight by rail is more fuel-efficient than 
trucking it. In FY14, FedEx Freight shifted about 1.9 million Ibs. of freight from road to rail and avoided nearly 2 million gallons of fuel and 292 metric tons of CO
2e emissions. In FY14, its rail 
use was 17.5 percent higher than in FY13.
FedEx Freight, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground 
and FedEx Custom Critical are long-standing members of the EPA SmartWay
® Transport 
Partnership, which provides incentives to  
carriers and shippers to improve environmental performance, operational efficiency and supply-  
chain sustainability. In addition, 1.7 percent of the total miles  
traveled by FedEx Ground trailers was on rail in FY14, an 11 percent increase from FY13.
This year, in the large package carrier fleet cate -
gory, FedEx Express was the recipient of the 
2014 EPA SmartWay Excellence Award, which salutes significant strides toward a sustainable transportation future.FedEx implements fuel-efficient driving and routing in several ways. We choose smaller vehicles on routes that do not require additional capacity. We use specialized software to plot the shortest routes and improve load density to make our operations leaner and more efficient. We also optimize vehicle operation through idle reduction, speed control, synchronizing drive -
train gear ratios with the engine’s power  
and torque, and by using automated manual transmissions that manage gear shifting more accurately. By making routing improvements in FY14, FedEx Freight drivers avoided an average of about 14,000 highway miles a day. Over the year, this saved 571,799 gallons of fuel and 5,857 metric tons of CO
2e emissions. 
The Eco-Drive program at FedEx Express  
educates, encourages and rewards drivers for adopting fuel-efficient driving behaviors such as starting slowly, maintaining constant speed, avoiding idling and simply turning down the air conditioning. The program is active in 36 countries across Asia Pacific, North America, Europe and the Middle East.
New Eco-Drive initiatives this year include a 
monthly rewards program launched in January 2014 for drivers in China who increase their  station’s average monthly fuel improvement by 3 percent or more compared with the same month the previous year. Between January and the end of May 2014, the program saved 134,778 gallons of fuel. In Canada, telematics devices on 20 FedEx Express vehicles provide feedback to drivers on idling, acceleration and braking behaviors. This same pilot program compares actual routes taken with those planned. As a result, in FY14, 19 of our Canadian stations improved fuel efficiency by over 2 percent compared with the previous year, including three stations that improved their fuel economy by more than 10 percent.
FUEL-EFFICIENT ACTIONS
5,000
FACILITIES WORLDWIDEFACILITIES 1.6 We have around 5,000 facilities worldwide, including air and ground hubs, local 
stations, freight service centers and retail sites. Electricity consumption at these facilities accounts for all of our Scope 2 emissions. Although it's a smaller part  
of our overall carbon footprint, we're still focused on conservation, of course,  
and we address that by installing energy-saving technologies plus on-site solar generation in a number of locations.
ENERGY CONSERVATION
When it comes to existing facilities, upgrading 
lighting systems to more efficient models is  
one of the most effective steps we can take. This year, we retrofitted 182 facilities across  
our operating companies with more efficient lighting that saves energy and improves the work environment for our team members, including at the FedEx Ground headquarters in Pittsburgh. This brings the total number of sites retrofitted to almost 700. In total, these changes saved almost 180 million kWh of electricity in FY14, avoiding 122,517 metric tons of CO
2e 
emissions. In addition, a number of locations have installed lighting control systems to further increase energy savings.
Last year, we also identified an opportunity  
to conserve further by converting outdoor 
high-intensity discharge (HID) lighting to light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. FedEx Ground has identified several sites to pilot  
retrofitting LED exterior lighting, which will reduce energy consumed by lighting fixtures at those sites by an estimated 50 percent. FedEx Express continues to work with lighting  
manufacturers to develop LED lights that can be used at airport gates. In FY14, FedEx Express installed 528-watt LED fixtures at four airport gates in Memphis, replacing 1,080-watt HID  
fixtures, reducing energy consumption per  
fixture by more than 50 percent. We will be evaluating both of these projects to assess  
their performance and potential for broader application.
At our operating companies, we communicate 
with our team members about steps they can take to conserve energy such as checking the thermostat settings, keeping air flow clear and turning lights off.FEDEX 40 FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ENVIRONMENT

2e) IN FY14
TOP 25 SOLAR GENERATOR
In 2014, FedEx was once again recognized by 
the Solar Energy Industry Association as one of the top 25 solar-generating companies in the U.S., ranking 22nd by number of solar installations  
and 18th by generating capacity. We are the only transportation-logistics company to receive this recognition.PROGRESS
Two new sites opened in FY14 include on-site solar  
energy gen  e ration: the FedEx Trade Networks Riverview 
Solar Technology Park in Tonawanda, N.Y. (see page 42),  
and the FedEx Express North Pacific Regional Hub at  
Kansai Airport, Japan.
Later in 2014, FedEx Ground completed installation of solar- 
energy generation systems at sites in Dallas, Texas, and Queens, N.Y. Together, these two solar sites will generate more than 3.5 million kWh of electricity each year, and at least 
two more solar installations are planned for development in 
FY15. Addition  a lly, FedEx Ground started producing electricity 
from a solid oxide fuel cell at its facility in Rialto, Calif.  
(See page 42.)GOAL
Expand on-site generation and  
continue to procure renewable 
energy for our facilitiesCLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY
Where appropriate and economically feasible, 
we look for ways to expand on-site generation of renewable energy, which reduces emissions and operating expenses at the site. Our operating companies take advantage of a number of  
different renewable technologies, including solar power, combined heat and power generation, 
and solid oxide fuel cells. Some of our facilities 
are large hubs that lend themselves particularly 
well to rooftop solar arrays, and as a result  
that is often the best way for us to source 
renewable energy.GOAL
Seek LEED (Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design) certification on all new U.S. FedEx Express buildings
PROGRESS
No new FedEx Express buildings were LEED-certified in FY14, although six are in the process of being reviewed for certification. We 
currently have 10 LEED-certified 
buildings, including the FedEx Express world headquarters in Memphis—also a FY14 Energy  
Star Award winner.
In addition, in FY14, FedEx Ground 
achieved LEED certification for two facilities—in Burbank, Calif., and 
North Seattle, Wash.—and is pur  s uing 
LEED certification at three more  
facilities. The new FedEx Office headquarters in Plano, Texas,  
scheduled to open in September 
2015, will also be LEED-certified.

RIVERVIEW SOLAR TECHNOLOGY PARK
DOUBLING GREEN SITES AT FEDEX FREIGHT 
FUEL CELL ENERGY EFFICIENCY In September 2014, FedEx Trade Networks 
opened a cutting-edge office and distribution facility at the Riverview Solar Technology Park in Tonawanda, N.Y. This is the first solar-ready business park in the state, as well as the first  
to feature advanced solar architecture, which provides additional benefits such as shading and protection from wind and rain. It is expected  
to offset 1 million kWh of fossil fuel-sourced  electricity over the 10-year lease and avoid 571 metric tons of CO
2e emissions. 
The Tonawanda facility’s solar monitoring system tracks performance and energy savings minute by minute and can be viewed on the FedEx Trade Networks’ solar monitoring website.
We're proud, too, that Riverview has several 
additional sustainability innovations at work. Along with energy-efficient lighting throughout, the campus uses low-flow water consumption and dedicated bio-beds, which provide underground water retention for storm water management and soil erosion control. These technologies have already reduced water consumption by approximately 50 percent when compared with standard fixtures.
At FedEx Freight, all facilities in the U.S. and Canada work to conserve energy, reduce waste and improve internal supply-chain efficiencies under the GREEN Building program banner. They encourage site managers to champion the cause and help move the company forward via  
a GREEN Site designation. Facilities can be  recognized at one of two levels, depending  
on the extent of team members' engagement with green actions such as pledging to reduce disposal cup waste by bringing in their own cups. Local environmental action facilitators (LEAFs) champion sustainability at each local site.During FY14, the total number of GREEN Sites almost doubled: 101 facilities gained a new  
designation over the year, either as a new Level 1 Site or by advancing to Level 2.
In September 2014, FedEx Ground started using a solid oxide fuel cell at its facility in Rialto, Calif. The fuel cell uses a chemical reaction to combine natural gas and a small amount of water to generate clean and efficient electricity at a lower cost. The system provides about  
one-third of the electricity needs of the facility and will reduce CO
2e emissions by at least 230 
metric tons a year. Rialto has become one of the  most energy-efficient hubs at FedEx Ground, as it is also home to one of our largest rooftop solar installations.
In addition, FedEx Express continues using five 
100-kilowatt Bloom Energy fuel cells at its hub in Oakland, Calif., which, when combined with the solar energy system at that location, provided 44 percent of that facility’s electricity demand  
in FY14.

USE OF  
MATERIALS
Our primary use of materials is for the FedEx branded packaging 
we provide to customers, including cardboard and plastics, as well 
as the paper stock used at FedEx Office.
Other materials we use include tires, vehicle 
maintenance supplies, pallets and dunnage materials, and office products. We aim to source materials responsibly, and we explore opportunities for reducing our consumption by 
repurposing and reusing materials such as 
wooden pallets and air pillows as many times as 
possible.2

PACKAGING 
WITH RECYCLED CONTENTPAPER 2.1 The FedEx Office procurement policy for forest-based products requires vendors 
to apply responsible forest-management practices and standards for recycled content. They seek out sustainable options for customers by conducting assessments 
of paper sources and supply chains, which include robust audits of sup  p liers’ 
operations and harvest lands. They encourage customers to choose sustainable options by identifying these choices clearly. In customer-facing materials such as the FedEx Office Paper and Binding Book, logos help to distinguish stock that  
is certified as responsibly sourced, contains recycled materials or is made from non-wood pulp sources. They reinforce and remind sourcing and supply chain team members of the policy and the sustainable choices available to customers.
PACKAGING 2.2 Cardboard is the largest single component of our reported packaging materials volume, comprising around 80 percent. The majority of our cardboard consumption is for the FedEx-branded packaging provided to customers for shipping at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. This branded packaging is made from approximately 60 percent recycled content. Corrugated cardboard used by FedEx Ground for re-packing customer packages during shipping is made from 45 percent recycled content.
In addition to cardboard, we use materials such 
as bubble wrap, plastic air pillows, chipboard, Tyvek envelopes and tape to safely transport our customers’ documents, packages and freight. Our primary priority is that customers receive their shipments in the best condition possible. However, where we can do so without compromising cargo safety, we try to minimize our use of virgin materials. For example, by shredding used cardboard for reuse as packing material, we minimize use of polystyrene and plastic air pillows.FedEx Ground is striving to source more  
sustainable plastics. During FY14, FedEx 
Ground worked with its supplier to increase the 
recycled content of the plastic bags used to 
con s olidate customers’ small packages as 
they’re being processed through sorting and linehaul distribution operations. It is aiming to increase the recycled content above the  
current 30 percent by re-using some of its used bags to manufacture the new ones.Our Paperless Billing and FedEx Electronic Trade Documents programs help our 
customers save paper too. FedEx customers in 123 countries and territories save paper by submitting customs documentation electronically through our Electronic Trade Documents program.In FY14, 98% of paper purchased for use by 
FedEx Office was third-party-certified as respon -
sibly sourced, with 84% of it certified by the FSC.84%

OTHER 
MATERIALS2.3 We also look for ways to minimize virgin materials in the various products we  
use for our internal operations. For example, we try to source remanufactured 
furniture and printer cartridges for our offices. The FedEx Freight Supply Exchange Program connects locations that have surplus office supplies with other locations where they can be used, reducing waste sent to landfill, as well as conserving  
natural resources. In addition, 79 percent of the tires purchased by FedEx Freight, 66 percent of tires purchased by FedEx Ground and 68 percent of tires purchased by FedEx Express in FY14 were retreaded.
WATER 2.4 The majority of water that we consume is for facility uses, including in bathrooms, kitchens and outdoor sprinklers. As part of our various sustainable buildings  
initiatives—such as the GREEN Building program at FedEx Freight and our LEED-certified buildings—we install water-conservation technologies where appropriate.
For example, in FY14, FedEx Ground implemented 
water-saving technologies and techniques at its Pittsburgh headquarters, which reduces water use by 2.4 million gallons annually—equivalent to almost 25 percent of all water use at that facility.Some water is needed for vehicle and aircraft 
maintenance, although the majority of FedEx 
airplanes and some trucks are cleaned with a 
“dry wash” process that uses a soapy liquid 
and limited water. Most of this maintenance is 
carried out by third-party vendors who supply 
their own water.FEDEX 45 FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —ENVIRONMENT
SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING
We're proud to be a founding member in the Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council, a U.S. nonprofit organization that supports  
and recognizes sustainable procurement. We continued to support the Council this year, attending its annual meeting and contributing  
to discussions on how to improve sustainable purchasing in the areas of transportation and fuels, fiber- and timber-based products and more.As an extension of our work with the Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council, we want to increase collaboration with key suppliers in order to identify opportunities to make our supply chain more sustainable. We use sustainability risk-screening criteria in our sourcing processes. Responses from vendors are reviewed by the strategic sourcing and environmental sustain -
ability teams to help identify and minimize potential risk.

•  F edEx Ground began a tire casing reuse  
program, selling old tires to vendors that 
repurposed them for off-road and farm use. This diverted around 5,500 tire casings from landfill.
•
  M ore than 12,000 tons of materials, including 
plastic film, cardboard, paper, plastic bottles and scrap metal, were recycled at FedEx Ground as a result of its Ground Green  
program—47 percent more than in FY13. Ground Green integrates waste reduction  
and recycling techniques into everyday  
work activities by increasing team member  
awareness and encouraging involvement. •
  F edEx Freight increased paper recycling through 
a document shred program.
•  M ore than 314,000 lbs. of aluminum was  
recycled as a result of the lightweight aircraft container modification program at FedEx Express, which also reduced aircraft fuel consumption.

During FY14, we further improved our data  
collection in North America, which has 
increased the amount of waste we are reporting this year. However, we continue to have gaps in our data, since waste at many of our facilities is collected by haulers that are contracted by a landlord or local municipality, or co-mingled with other tenants’ waste in shared facilities such as airports and strip malls. Internationally, the number of waste collectors and the variety of processes make it extremely challenging to track our waste data.ENVIRONMENTAL  
MANAGEMENT
Our corporate Environmental Policy and strategy guide all of  
our operating companies in the management of environmental 
performance.
The enterprise-wide Environmental Management 
System (EMS), based on the key elements of ISO 14001, requires each FedEx operating  
company to identify relevant environmental impacts and to maintain management programs that minimize or eliminate those impacts. The EMS is overseen and reviewed annually by  
the Vice President of Environmental Affairs and Sustainability.Our companies share synergies, ideas and  
innovations through Sustainability Impact 
Teams (SITs) for global Vehicles, Facilities, Air 
Oper  a tions, IT, EarthSmart, Data/Reporting and 
Supply Chain. The SITs and operating companies' sustainability leaders report to our chief  
sustainability officer, the Vice President of Environmental Affairs and Sustainability, who also chairs the FedEx Enterprise Sustainability Council (FESC), our executive member

COMPLIANCE 4.1 We have robust processes and systems in place to ensure compliance with all 
environmental regulatory requirements, including fuel spill prevention and containment.
These provisions encompass comprehensive 
response plans, provided primarily by contracted specialty service providers, to ensure that if spills do occur, they do not cause significant harm to the well-being of our team members, the community or the local environment. 
In FY14, 124 significant spills—defined as spills 
of hazardous materials like oil, fuel and chemicals as those reportable to the appropriate environ -
mental regulatory agency, such as the U.S. government’s National Response Center—
occurred. Additionally, 129 environmental 
inspections by external agencies globally identi -
fied two regulatory violations for which we 
were fined. The most significant of these was 
due to expired water permits. In total, we were 
fined $15,100 in environmental penalties during

DISASTER READINESS, 
RELIEF AND RECOVERY
Disasters strike without warning and present countless challenges 
to the communities and livelihoods impacted. FedEx is uniquely 
positioned to respond to these crises because we can move 
resources quickly and efficiently around the world in the wake of a disaster—a key factor in the success of relief and recovery efforts. 
We also recognize that readiness and resilience measures are a  
critical first line of defense and can help minimize a community’s 
vulnerability to future events.
FedEx team members, including drivers, pilots and 
operations teams, work continuously to provide services and aid—including supplies, food  
and medicine—to afflicted communities. Our expansive global network and reach allow us to promptly deploy our resources and logistics expertise to communities in need. We are proud to once again be teaming up with the American Red Cross, Direct Relief and The Salvation Army in their ongoing humanitarian efforts. In FY14, we donated more than $2.6 million in cash and 
in-kind support to these organizations.
In April 2014, we collaborated with the Arbor 
Day Foundation to launch the Community Tree 
Recovery program. This effort will help to 
restore ecosystems in disaster-afflicted areas 
across the United States. For more information 
on this effort, please refer to our community

EBOLA
In 2014, an Ebola outbreak ravaged West Africa, 
causing the deaths of thousands of people and putting at risk countless more. In fall 2014, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that if the epidemic is not better treated and contained, more than a million people in Africa could be infected within months. Taking action, FedEx has joined the aid effort by transporting much-needed medical materials 
(surgical masks, syringes, hand sanitizer and more)  
to Ebola-stricken areas in West Africa. As part of our commitment, we have used our global network and logistics expertise to move these vital medical supplies as a charitable shipment. We are proud to be joining forces with several government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to help treat and prevent the spread of Ebola.
TYPHOON HAIYAN
In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan struck  
the Philippines, killing thousands of people  
and displacing millions more, stranding them  
without access to food, water and essential 
medical supplies.
In response, FedEx worked with Direct Relief 
and other relief organizations to transport more than $10 million in relief aid and medical supplies to affected communities. We donated our charter airlift, logistics and technical expertise to assist with the shipment. In total, almost 200,000 lbs. of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals  
were delivered.

DISASTER READINESS: LEARNING FROM HAITI
In the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake,  
FedEx teamed up with global and regional orga -
nizations to evaluate disaster response efforts 
and share learnings. We leverage our logistical expertise and funding to improve the networks that deliver relief and help communities back on the path to recovery.
INTERACTION: INNOVATIONS  
IN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS
FedEx first started working with InterAction, a 
U.S.-based alliance of NGOs, in 2010 with support for the Haiti Aid Map. The map, created in response to the 2010 earthquake, allows users to see where NGO money goes and which activities this money supports. By providing information that is not available elsewhere, the map helps coordinate efforts among relief providers and avoids the backup of supplies and aid.
The Haiti Aid Map has evolved into a  
com p rehensive global NGO Aid Map, providing 
information on more than 130 organizations and 
9,200 projects worldwide. Aligning with our efforts to promote preparedness, this tool allows communities and NGOs to mobilize faster when disaster strikes.
In 2014, FedEx again joined forces with 
InterAction to deliver the second annual FedEx Award for Innovations in Disaster Prepared  n ess. 
ISET-International won for its initiative “Shel  t ering 
from a Gathering Storm,” which examines resilient housing design as a cost-efficient way to protect vulnerable communities from the risks posed by natural disasters.
The first-ever award was given in 2013 to 
Habitat for Humanity for an innovative project  
to guard against earthquake damage to homes in Tajikistan.
AMERICAS RELIEF TEAM: PORT 
RESILIENCY IN LATIN AMERICA  
AND THE CARIBBEAN
Since 2012, FedEx and AmericasRelief Team 
have worked together to develop and employ the Port Resiliency Program (PReP) in vulnerable coastal regions throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. PReP works with airports to assess their needs and implement resiliency measures to lessen the impact of extreme events.
Our collaboration with AmericasRelief began 
with a workshop in the wake of the Haiti earth -
quake. It was determined that the Haiti airport could have been operational much faster had there been a more robust disaster-response plan in place. In fact, many airports in the Caribbean and Latin American region face unique challenges due to extreme weather  
and often lack the infrastructure and training to 
respond effectively to these events.
In 2013, we helped AmericasRelief initiate a 
pilot program at the Las Américas International 
Airport in the Dominican Republic. The pilot, 
which included preparedness trainings and  
simulations for senior management, operations 
staff and representatives from several national 
agencies, was a success and has prompted  
the expansion of the program into additional 
ports across the LAC region. FedEx is proud  
to continue our support of the AmericasRelief 
Team through funding and technical expertise 
as it initiates PReP in Merida, Mexico, and San 
Jose, Costa Rica, in the coming year.AMERICAN 
RED CROSS1.1
FedEx has a long-standing relationship with the American Red Cross (ARC), and 
we are proud to offer our resources, people, global networks and logistics to assist ARC's extensive relief efforts. Since the start of our collaboration in 1995, we have 
donated more than $15 million in cash and in-kind support to the orga  n ization, and 
shipped thousands of pounds of ARC relief supplies. In FY14, we continued our support of ARC, donating more than $1.63 million. We also provided assistance to ARC disaster-preparedness initiatives.
FedEx is a member of the Annual Disaster Giv  i ng 
Program, which allows ARC to respond to hard-
hit communities across the United States. Our expanded relationship includes a $1 million pledge toward a new ARC facility in Memphis, Tenn. This new Mid-South Red Cross Chapter will house a disaster operations center, blood distribution center, health and safety training classrooms, disaster action team staging area/storage, volunteer work center and training rooms, radio communications and private client 
interview rooms, as well as a community meeting 
space that can be used for volunteer training 
and by ARC community partners.
In FY14, FedEx participated in the ARC 
Preparedness Road Show. We provided in-kind 
support and transported IT equipment critical 
for hands-on disaster relief training. As a result, 
ARC was able to conduct workshops in seven 
at-risk communities across the United States.SUPPORT SINCE

At FedEx, we understand the value of increased speed and efficiency better than almost anyone, and are proud that the trucks we’ve donated have provided immediate relief to people affected by natural disasters.
Each truck can feed 1,000–2,500 people per 
day, and volunteers offer both physical and  emotional support for survivors and first 
responders. When not responding to disasters, 
the trucks often serve as mobile feeding units 
for underserved or homeless populations.

THE DIRECT RELIEF PROGRAM TO DELIVER:Globally, more than a fifth of all traffic-related fatalities are pedestrians. While the 
child pedestrian death rate in the U.S. is down by 55 percent since 1995, a teen pedestrian is injured or killed nearly every hour of every day. FedEx is committed to raising awareness about road and pedestrian safety, and we are working closely with organizations such as Safe Kids Worldwide.
This year, FedEx and Safe Kids are proud to be 
celebrating the 15-year anniversary of the Safe Kids Walk This Way program. Launched in 2000, the program brings global attention to pedestrian safety issues and makes the streets safer for both motorists and pedestrians. Walk This Way operates year-round, conducting research on safety habits, raising awareness through community outreach and education and making safety improvements to school zones.Since the start of our relationship with Safe Kids 
in 2000, Walk This Way has expanded and now 
operates in 10 countries. In total, the program 
has reached over 10 million students with  
messages on pedestrian safety, and more than 
16,000 FedEx team members have shown their 
support, volunteering countless hours of serv  i ce 
along the way.
Our current efforts in support of the collaboration 
include our lead sponsorship of the Safe Roads | Safe Kids Global Roads Safety Summit in Washington, D.C. and the extension of our child pedestrian road safety work with Safe Kids Worldwide into South Africa. The Summit brings together thought leaders in road safety from around the world to convene, share best practices and create solid action plans to enhance road safety around the world. Our initiative with Safe Kids in South Africa will bring the number of countries around the world where we are addressing child pedestrian road safety to 11.FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —COMMUNITY FEDEX 55
PEDESTRIAN AND
ROAD SAFETY
At FedEx, pedestrian and road safety is a top priority. Globally, more 
than one million people die in traffic-related incidents each year, and 
almost a quarter of the victims are pedestrians. Road injuries are also 
the leading cause of death for people between the ages of 15 and 29.
With more than 100,000 FedEx owned and  
contracted vehicles making deliveries and moving 
possibilities each day, we are committed to ensuring the safety of those pedestrians,  
bicyclists and drivers we share the road with. Through our driver training, safety policies and awareness programs, we ensure that our team  members always put safety above all. For more 
information on driver safety policies, programs 
and training activities, please see pages 73–75. 
FedEx is also proud to maintain long-standing 
collaborations with organizations dedicated  
to advocating for road and pedestrian safety  
and awareness.2

SUSTAINABILITY3
At FedEx, we are committed to minimizing the environmental 
impact of our daily operations. We understand that promoting  
environmental stewardship extends beyond our workplace and  
suppliers to the communities and team members that support us.
Through our philanthropic networks, we strive to 
create a lasting impact by helping to make our transportation more sustainable, our ecosystems more resilient and our communities stronger.
Our EarthSmart Outreach initiative encourages 
team members to engage with the community through activities designed to promote sustainable 
practices. We collaborate with new and existing 
affiliate organizations to advance our sustainability 
commitments even further. In FY14, 630 FedEx

For decades, FedEx has been proud to work with Orbis International in its efforts 
to eradicate avoidable blindness in developing nations. Orbis International is a global NGO with a mission to bring awareness to eye health and provide preventative measures and treatment options to address avoidable blindness.
FedEx is the sole sponsor of Delivering Sight 
Worldwide, an international program that provides direct support to Orbis efforts. Our commitment supports two Flying Eye Hospital medical  
programs per year, an agreement that is secured through 2016. FedEx volunteers fly Orbis’ Flying Eye Hospital aircraft, deliver medical supplies 
and provide mechanical maintenance on the 
ground throughout the year.
Last year, we sponsored Flying Eye Hospital pro -

DIVERSITY: 
SCHOLARSHIPS AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS4.3
With a global workforce that spans six continents, FedEx is a dedicated supporter 
of diversity-related initiatives. Promoting diversity is essential to connecting  
communities and providing equal access to opportunities. For example, in the U.S., we strive to empower minority youth with the educational and professional development tools needed to become leaders in school, at work and throughout the community.
In FY14, we allocated more than $1.2 million toward diversity scholarships and educational  
programs. The program highlights include:
HISPANIC SCHOLARSHIP FUND
During the 2013/14 school year, FedEx 
volunteers supported five Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF) College 101 
workshops for approx  i mately 1,000 
students and their parents. The  
workshops provide information on  college preparation, financial aid

EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PASSION OF MINE. GROWING UP, 
MY PARENTS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO PROVIDE ME WITH A POST -
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT NEITHER OF 
THEM WENT TO COLLEGE.
Without this support, I know that there is no 
way I would be where I am today. However, upon graduating from college and getting my first job in New York, it was clear to me that my education shouldn’t stop there.
It wasn’t very common for people in my  
community to attend graduate school, so when 
I expressed my desire to pursue an MBA, I was met with resistance. How would I be able to afford it? What was wrong with the job that  
I currently had? I knew that I would need  
additional support.
When I heard about the Hispanic Scholarship 
Fund program, I realized that my dream of attaining an MBA might actually be a reality. The HSF program provides minority youth with the knowledge and resources they need to pursue opportunities in higher education.
Since finishing my MBA, I have been a proud 
supporter the HSF program. When I found out that FedEx, my employer of more than 16 years, sponsored 20 four-year HSF scholarships annually, I was overjoyed and eager to help out even more. It is because of corporate support like this that I was able to obtain my MBA and that countless other youth can pursue opportunities in higher education that they might have never thought possible.At FedEx, diversity efforts extend beyond  
educational initiatives. For example, in FY14 FedEx co-sponsored the NAACP Image Awards and was a lead sponsor of the National Civil Rights Museum Freedom Awards. We also provided financial support to the Dress for 
Success annual gala, the National Urban League Annual Convention and College Fair and the National Council of La Raza’s Líderes program 
for His  p anic youth.

We are proud to acknowledge that FedEx support has helped to make the current TFA corps the most inclusive ever, with half of the new recruits identifying themselves as a person of color.
In FY14, we also supported TFA by:
•
  C ontinuing as founding sponsor of the TFA 
Rising Leaders Fellowship program. Each year, the Fellows convene in Washington, D.C., for 
the Rising Leaders Summit. They spend the next 15 months working with local mentors and other Fellows to lead initiatives that tackle education inequity on campus and in their communities. In FY14, the summit brought together more than 60 top students from around the country.

FIRST® ROBOTICS COMPETITION
Since 2002, FedEx has provided in-kind  
shipping services to the FIRST® (For Inspiration 
and Rec  o gnition of Science and Technology) 
Robotics Competition (FRC®), moving more 
than 11 million lbs. of robotic equipment during this time. The competition is an annual event that draws together teams of innovative  
students to design and build robots that complete tasks and compete against one another. Each year, FedEx donates approximately $1 million in retail shipping support to the competition. This  
allows for delivery of the robot starter kits to the teams, as well as transportation of the completed 
robots to the FIRST Robotics Cham  p ionship 
each spring.
FedEx also contributed $100,000 toward the 
FRC Rookie Grant program. This program will help to sponsor more than 187 new teams over a three-year period.This past year marked the first annual FedEx Innovation Challenge. It is a social media-based competition consisting of math and science problems, scavenger hunt activities, photo  
ops, FedEx innovation trivia and more. Teams competing in the 2014 FIRST Robotics Competition Championship and the FIRST Tech Challenge World Championship can participate for a chance to win grants totaling $15,000 for their future FIRST Robotics initiative.

CHALLENGING YEAR
Despite our “safety-above-all” culture, 2014 
was a particularly difficult year. We take  
the responsibility of protecting our communities and team members seriously and are making targeted investments through safety improvement  
initiatives and technologies across our operating companies to build a safer and more resilient company. ( page 74 )HEALTHWAYS WELL-BEING PROGRAM
We launched the Healthways Well-Being Program to provide team members with

(page 81 )OVERVIEW
Across continents, FedEx team members are on the move, delivering 
on our promise of superior service and creating outstanding 
experiences for customers. It is our team members and shared 
company culture that unite us as we move toward turning tomorrow’s possibilities into reality today.
FedEx is passionate about people. This starts 
with our team members and extends to the cus -
tomers and communities we serve. Across our operating companies, team members share a professional commitment and passion that drive our exceptional service to customers worldwide.That is why we work tirelessly every day to 
make FedEx a safe and inclusive place to work. 
We provide opportunities to help our team 
members advance, as well as competitive benefits 
to keep them happy and healthy. This commitment 
to our people builds loyalty, and in turn, supports 
our business.1
THE PURPLE PROMISE 1.1 The FedEx Purple Promise is both a commitment to customer service and a  
fundamental philosophy that motivates our team members daily. The pledge is 
simple: “I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.” Empowering team members to deliver on this pledge requires ongoing investment in our workforce, from recruiting to training to quality-of-life considerations. In this way, FedEx develops team members who go above and beyond in every customer interaction.
FedEx has more than 300,000 team members 
across more than 220 countries and territories, including independent service providers for FedEx Ground and FedEx Custom Critical, to meet our customers’ needs. “I WILL MAKE EVERY 
FEDEX EXPERIENCE OUTSTANDING.”71 FEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLE
RETENTION:  
IT’S MUTUAL1.2 Team members frequently stay with FedEx for long periods and even entire 
careers. Keeping them engaged is important to the success of our company. In FY14, we retained more than 80.4 percent of our full-time U.S. team members.
Our FY14 global retention rate was 67.1 percent 
and measures seasonal and part-time team members, as well as full-time team members. Annually, we see significant hiring and then turnover following our peak holiday season when temporary personnel are needed to  
handle higher shipment volumes. While we can attribute a portion of the decline in retention to 
this seasonal effect, we understand that there 
are other factors involved. Moving forward, we 
intend to conduct further analysis in order to 
understand additional causes that contribute to 
fluctuations in our retention rates.72
FEDEX CODE OF BUSINESS 
CONDUCT AND ETHICS1.3 Maintaining the FedEx reputation for integrity, honesty, and reliability calls for a 
shared way of thinking across our global workforce. We set high standards for our team members and require compliance with the FedEx Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Code works to reinforce our company values and lays out our expected behaviors of professional conduct in areas such as health and safety, prohibiting harassment and discrimination, conflicts of interest, and gifts and entertainment. New team members are directed to the Code of Conduct during their orientations. This year, we updated the Code to address our policies in the areas of human rights and international trade controls.
We ask team members to report any possible 
violations of the Code through our FedEx   
Alert Line call-in service, or web-based system  (available 24 hours a day), or by directly  
con t acting FedEx management, Legal or Human 
Resources Departments.FEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLE
HIGH HONORS FOR THE HUMAN TOUCH
Every year, we celebrate our team members’ achievements with two awards  that recognize superior customer service and 
selfless assistance to others. From accelerating the delivery of life-saving medical devices to helping victims of  
roadside accidents, the actions of award recipients exemplify FedEx core values  in exceptional circumstances.
THE PURPLE PROMISE CHAIRMAN’S AWARD
The Purple Promise Awards are inspired by  
the FedEx promise to make every customer 
experience outstanding. In FY14, we presented 61 Purple Promise Awards and 16 Purple Promise Chairman’s Awards, which represent the best-of-the-best Purple Promise Award  
winners. Here’s the story of one Purple Promise Chairman’s Award winner:
Daniela Malaquias, Customer Representative in 
Solutions, received an urgent customer request relating to the Oscar ceremonies less than 24 hours away. A package containing special items to be displayed at the prestigious event was  
still in Brazil. Daniela worked to locate the pack -
age. Paulo Nogueira, FedEx Customer Service 
Manager in São Paulo, then took a commercial 
airline flight to Los Angeles to hand-deliver the 
package. A Los Angeles operations manager 
drove Paulo to the recipient’s doorstep, result -
ing in an exceptional customer experience. 
Because Paulo and Daniela went above and 
beyond to deliver for the customer and took  
precious time away from their personal lives, 
they delivered on the Purple Promise.
THE HUMANITARIAN AWARD
The Humanitarian Award recognizes team members who have gone above and beyond basic community responsibility to help others. One of this year’s award winners was Samphun Sea-Teaw, a FedEx courier in Thailand. Samphun witnessed a motorbike crash and immediately parked his van and checked on the rider, who was seriously injured and unconscious. Samphun 
called for help and then used the flashlight func -
tion on his mobile phone to signal oncoming 
traffic to slow down and avoid the lane where 
the accident had occurred. Thanks to Samphun’s 
efforts, further accidents and injury to the victim 
were avoided.WORKPLACE SAFETY
Each business day, we move more than 10.5 million packages to  
customers across the globe. For many team members, the world’s 
roads are their workplace. Every year, upward of 50 million road-  
related injuries occur globally. That’s why the safety of our team 
members and the public is our first priority at FedEx.
Our critical focus on safety is embodied by  
the FedEx Safety Above All philosophy and  
our Chairman and CEO Frederick W. Smith’s 
commitment to it: 
We move forward on Safety Above All by  
integrating comprehensive workplace safety 
education into our operations and requiring team members to follow strict safety standards and protocols. We believe in a “best practices” approach to safety, and in many cases, our safe -
guards exceed regulatory requirements. To stay ahead of the curve, we invest millions of dollars in equipment and technology that prevents  
injuries and accidents in our operations.
To complement enterprise-wide standards, 
each FedEx operating company is responsible for implementing customized approaches to the unique safety needs of its business. Specific areas of importance include aircraft and vehicle safety, safe handling of packages and hazardous materials, severe weather preparedness and enforcement of safety practices.
While we take great pride in these principles 
and protocols, we acknowledge that we must continually strive to increase our safety efforts. In FY14, we worked on:•
  Enhancing safety engagement: A new “Safety Focus Program” was implemented in 2014, which delivered enhanced safety engagement and support to FedEx operations to meet safety performance goals. The program relies on a  
collaborative process among local leadership, district and region management, and Corporate Safety to identify areas for improvement  
and apply Quality Driven Management (QDM) principles to achieve safety goals. Safety  
specialists play a key role, actively engaging and supporting continuous improvement efforts toward a heightened safety-above-all culture.
•
  Targeting areas for improvement: FedEx Express established the Safety Partnership Location (SPL) program to improve safety in locations with higher-than-average accident and injury rates. FedEx Express provided  
management at these sites with assistance in developing and implementing divisional safety plans that identified, reviewed and made  
corrective actions to reduce accidents. During FY14, our Memphis Hub Night organization had a 17 percent improvement in its SPL  
accident and injury rates.
•
  Introducing data driven programs: FedEx Freight implemented a new initiative to identify the root causes of accidents and injuries and improve follow-up after incidents. The  
program has enhanced our ability to gather accident and injury information immediately following an event and provide our teams with the tools to mitigate future occurrences.273 FEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLE
JUST AS WE SEEK TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THE 
SERVICE WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MUST ALSO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT CAN MAKE OUR WORKPLACE EVEN SAFER FOR OUR EMPLOYEES.
FREDERICK W. SMITH
Chairman, President and CEORECOGNIZING SAFETY
Recognizing safety performance is one way that 
FedEx reinforces safe work habits. In FY14, FedEx Express implemented a Quality Driven Management (QDM) based program called the Quality Driven Safety Award to do just that. The award is given based on a competition among FedEx Express facilities for the best combined vehicle and worker safety rates. Each quarter, the facilities with the best rates are rewarded with a cookout, plaque and a drawing for prizes. The goal of the program is to build awareness of safe work habits and increase pride in safety. FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground offer similar QDM safety initiatives.In addition to location-based awards, FedEx Express also recognizes individual team members through its Safe Driving Awards. Team members that operate safely and without an accident are eligible for several awards based on the length of their safe driving record.
WORKING WELL  
WITH OTHERS2.1Our first priority, is the safety and security of 
our team members and the communities where we operate—bar none. With over 100,000 owned and contracted vehicles on the road, over 300,000 team members worldwide and operations in 220+ countries and territories, we need to operate safely and are always striving to improve our performance. We believe in a “best 
practices” approach to safety and actively promote 
and support a culture of safety across the 
 organization through comprehensive workplace 
education programs.
FedEx has set many safety records and thou -
sands of our drivers drive accident-free each 
year. However, 2014 was a particularly difficult year for us as we experienced two tragedies—a highway crash in California that resulted in 10 fatalities and an incident at a FedEx facility in Atlanta where a troubled employee shot and injured six people before taking his own life. All of us at FedEx grieve for those individuals who lost their lives and those injured, and we offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to their families and loved ones.
We also saw our recordable vehicle accident 
rates and lost time injury rates go up slightly in FY14. We believe the largest factor contributing to this trend was the surge in severe weather events in North America in December of 2013. leading up to Christmas, several storms hit across North America, producing snow, ice, flooding and rain across nearly 30 states. This was a “perfect storm” and landed at the same time that we move the largest volume of packages across our operations and onto the roads for delivery. We saw accident and slip-and-fall injury events increase during this time. We take the responsibility of sharing the roads and 
 protecting our team members and communities 
seriously. That’s why we are focusing our Corporate Safety departments to work closely with our operations to target safety improvement 
 initiatives across our operating companies and 
facilities. In 2014, we updated our workplace 
violence training program to educate team members  
on how to respond to active shooter situations. We are also making targeted investments across all of our operating companies to improve safe driving and reduce unnecessary hazards on the road. This includes investing in technologies such as lane departure warnings and object 
detection systems on our vehicles to complement  
our standard safe driving practices.74 FEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLE
MICHAEL L. DUCKER  
President and Chief Executive Officer  
FedEx Freight
Much as we prioritize safety within our own operations, we also recognize that we must collaborate with external allies to 
improve safety outcomes overall. FedEx trucks share the roads with millions of vehicles each day, so there’s a common responsibility for safe driving. That’s why we work closely with organizations like the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, American Trucking Association, American Society of Safety Engineers and American Industrial Hygiene Association to share procedures for improving safety within and beyond our company. See pages 55–57  for more on how we work with third  
parties to support pedestrian and road safety outside of FedEx.ADVANCING SAFETY IN A CHALLENGING YEAR
CONTINUOUSLY ADVANCING OUR SAFETY PRACTICES REQUIRES UNWAVERING FOCUS. AS WE REFLECT BACK ON A CHALLENGING YEAR, WE ALSO LOOK AHEAD AT OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD A SAFER AND MORE RESILIENT COMPANY.
MEASURING 
SAFETY2.2 Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIR) is one metric that we use to analyze safety outcomes 
at FedEx. LTIR covers nonfatal injuries or work-related illnesses that cause a team member to lose work time beyond the calendar date of the injury or the illness’s onset. In FY14, our LTIR rate was 4.01. This is modestly higher than our FY13 rate of 3.88 percent.
Another metric we use to track safety outcomes 
is the Preventable Recordable Vehicle Accident Rate (per 1 million miles driven) globally. This includes vehicle accidents that resulted in fatali -
ties or injuries that were treated immediately after the event or required towing from the scene. In FY14, our rate was 0.31, compared to 0.30 in FY13.We regret to report that eight workplace fatalities 
took place in FY14 worldwide. Seven of these 
fatalities resulted from vehicle accidents. We 
extend our deepest condolences to the families 
of those team members and all others affected. 
We investigate all fatalities at FedEx to identify 
root causes and take corrective actions to prevent 
reoccurrences.
GLOBAL SAFETY TRENDS FY12 FY13 FY14
LOST TIME INJURY RATES, PER 200,000 HOURS WORKED* 3.72 3.88 4.01
PREVENTABLE RECORDABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENT RATES, PER 1 MILLION MILES DRIVEN 0.31 0.30 0.31
PREVENTING WORKPLACE 
VIOLENCE2.3 The safety and security of our team members is of the utmost importance. To 
ensure this, we have programs in place to help prevent workplace violence from occurring and have strong procedures for rapidly responding when incidents  
do occur.
Each year, every FedEx team member is trained 
on workplace violence prevention. The program reminds team members of the various ways to disclose potential or actual incidents of work -
place violence. Individuals can report incidents through the FedEx Alert Line or by speaking directly with management, Security, Human 
Resources or Legal. When incidents are 
reported, our Workplace Violence Response 
Team promptly investigates the claims and 
responds accordingly.
NATIONAL CHAMPIONS OF SAFETY75 FEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLE
A record 138 drivers represented FedEx at the  
2014 National Truck Driving Championships (NTDC) in Pittsburgh this year. The event is known as the “Super Bowl of Safety,” and to earn the honor of competing, each driver has to win his or her respective state competition and also drive accident-free for a minimum of one year. In the championship, each driver must demonstrate his or her driving skills and knowledge through a series of tests, including a written exam, vehicle pre-trip inspection and driving skills challenge.
Debbie Conn earned her spot at the National 
Championships by placing first at the Arkansas State Truck Driving Championships. Debbie has been a professional driver for almost 25 years, nine of which have been with FedEx Freight in West Memphis, Ark. Since starting, she has racked up over 3.1 million safe-driving miles. Her tip to other motorists is to always keep your eyes and mind on the road and be aware of your surroundings.Four drivers representing FedEx were crowned 
National Champions in their respective driving 
classes. Six other FedEx drivers placed among 
the top finishers.
Paul Brandon was one of those National 
Champions. Paul has worked for FedEx Freight 
for 14 years, based in New Haven, Conn., and 
has earned over 1.1 million accident-free miles 
over a 35-year career. “Some people have  
hobbies,” states Paul. “My passion is the Truck 
Driving Championships.” We would like to 
salute all FedEx state and national champions 
like Debbie and Paul who make road safety a 
priority every day.*Global LTIR data is based on definitions from the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).TEAM MEMBER 
DEVELOPMENT
We are committed to helping our team members grow in their 
careers and rise through the ranks at FedEx. In fact, more than 70 
percent of our global management team was hired from within the 
organization. This strong track record reflects our investment in our team members through career training and development programs 
and recognition initiatives. Just as we move possibilities forward for 
the communities we serve, we seek to move our people forward as well, recognizing and developing their full potential.
We offer a variety of training and leadership  
programs that empower team members to 
excel in their jobs and gain the knowledge and skills required to get ahead. FedEx operating companies also implement specialized training and workforce development programs that target skills unique to their operating environment.
In FY14, team members from across the organi -
zation participated in an average of 13.8 hours of training per person. FY14 was a transition 
year at FedEx, where we focused on developing 
solutions to reduce travel-to-training costs and 
instead reach more individuals through technology  
and alternative education solutions. We’ve 
received positive user feedback on the new approach and are excited by the opportunities that technology can bring to our training methods.376
In 2014, we expanded the rollout of the FedEx 
Learning Center, our premier online team-  
member training platform, to eight FedEx  
operating companies. The tool allows team 
members to easily search through an extensive 
course catalog, self-enroll in educational offerings, 
track progress and review their learning history. 
We have over 275,000 users of the system so 
far and offer more than 14,000 courses.FEDEX LEARNING CENTER

TUITION 
ASSISTANCE3.1 We believe education is an important tool for professional growth and are committed 
to supporting our team members to pursue higher education. We make tuition assistance available to our full-time and part-time employees at FedEx. Tuition programs vary by operating company and range from $1,250 to $5,000 per employee per year.
RISING THROUGH 
THE RANKS3.3
Matthew Thornton III is an example of our commitment to advancing team members 
from within. In 1978, Matthew began his career with FedEx Express as a package handler. Since then, he has earned multiple promotions, including to Managing Director and later to Vice President and Senior Vice President positions within FedEx Express. Today, Matthew serves as Senior Vice President of FedEx Express U.S. Operations, overseeing the team responsible for U.S. domestic package pickup and delivery services, customer retail operations, and the FedEx Express customer service experience. Mr. Thornton guides a business segment with more than 53,000 employees who provide service to customers shipping an average of 2.6 million packages per day. The U.S. Operations division utilizes approximately 29,000 vehicles operating out of more than 650 locations.PROMOTING  
TEAM MEMBERS3.2 We prioritize hiring from within whenever possible. Prior to advertising job openings publicly, we often post positions internally first, which provides a strong incentive for team members to stay and grow at FedEx. Nearly all full-time U.S. team members received performance reviews in FY14. The reviews provide valuable feedback on current performance and help to prepare team members for possible advancement within FedEx.
Our Executive Development Teams at FedEx 
are tasked with preparing team members to advance into more senior roles. Approximately 98 percent of officers were promoted from within FedEx. Our commitment to advancing 
our team members has fostered a loyal, engaged 
and knowledgeable workforce.
EXECUTIVE CURRICULUM FOR ENTERPRISE-WIDE LEADERSHIP (EXCEL)
EXCEL is our executive development program, which brings together executives from across the organization to focus on strategy, change management and developing leadership skills that promote success. Since 2008, 78 participants  have gone through our EXCEL DRIVE program 
for directors, and another 75 through our EXCEL 
Advanced program for VPs. Nineteen participants 
in the EXCEL Advanced program have been  
promoted to a new or expanded role within FedEx.Thornton has received national recognition as one of Black Enterprise magazine’s “75 Most Powerful African-Americans in Corporate America” (2005) and “100 Most Powerful African-Americans in Corporate America” (2009 and 2012). In 2014, he was recognized by Uptown Professional  magazine as one of the “Top 100 Executives in America.” He currently 
serves on the Board of Directors of The 
Sherwin-Williams Company and Safe Kids 
Worldwide. He is also a member of the United 
Way Tocqueville Society and the Executive 
Leadership Council (ELC).
TRAINING FOR ENTERPRISE SUCCESS
We offer two training programs that help FedEx 
leaders from across the organization foster what we call the Seven Drivers for Enterprise Success. One of them is our Executive Center for Enrichment and Education (EXCEED). EXCEED is available to officers and directors, providing them with classroom learning, online tools and executive coaching opportunities.
Another important training program is our 
Leadership for Information, Networking and Knowledge (LINK) program. LINK provides FedEx managers across the enterprise with a central point of access to online learning resources that also support the development of the Seven Drivers for Enterprise Success. The site offers online continuing education, topical videos, book summaries and more.
The Seven Drivers for Enterprise Success were 
developed from key competencies within the company leadership models and reflect executive attributes that we consider to be critical to the future success of our company.
PASSPORT TO LEADERSHIP
The Global Leadership Corps program offers team members the opportunity to work abroad for one month—often with outside organizations on an innovative community project. The goal is to help team members acquire valuable leadership and teamwork skills while gaining insight into the emerging markets where FedEx business is growing rapidly.
In FY14, FedEx sent two Global Leadership 
Corps teams to Ahmedabad and Chennai, India. Projects ranged from developing campaigns to improve working conditions within the construction industry to providing clean cooking stoves and solar lights to communities in need.
“We had an opportunity to find a different type 
of meaning from our labor—to save lives by  
preventing accidents or to use our skills to help make the lives of the people there that much better,” stated one participant in the FY14 Global Leadership Corps program.78
FEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLE
For years, we have seen a growing shortage of truck drivers entering the field, while at the same time, FedEx Freight operations have experienced double-digit growth. To address this gap, we added almost 70 new truck-driving instructors to our Driver Development Course in FY14. As part of our “home-grown” approach to training, the course leads the industry and  
far exceeds many of the requirements of third-party truck-driving schools. The course has  
furthered our ability to hire from within, ensure the quality of the drivers that we put on the road, target hiring more female drivers and meet the growing demands of our operations.DRIVER DEVELOPMENT COURSE AT FEDEX FREIGHT
TEAM MEMBER  
FEEDBACK3.4 Listening to FedEx team members is important for our company success, and  
we take their feedback very seriously. In FY14, our annual confidential feedback 
surveys achieved a collective response rate of 90.8 percent. Each FedEx operating company collects feedback from team members on subjects including compensation, benefits, and manager and customer relationships. Surveys vary across operating companies and are not tracked at the enterprise level. We also surveyed over 270 team members on global citizenship issues as part of our materiality assessment.
ENGAGING  
TEAM MEMBERS3.5 FedEx encourages team members to provide suggestions and raise concerns to management through our formal and informal open-door policies. We facilitate communication through team member tools, including our intranet site (the Purple Hub), internal television network (FedEx Productions) and periodic newsletters. Events to engage team members are held throughout the year, including presentations from management, brown-bag lunches and town hall meetings.79 FEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLEENHANCING 
QUALITY OF LIFE
The success of our business is dependent on the health, wellness and 
overall well-being of our team members. We provide health and 
wellness, as well as financial security benefits, across our operating 
companies. This year, FedEx launched the Healthways Well-Being Program to provide team members with personalized resources to 
manage their health. We also work to customize benefit packages 
to meet the needs of team members in the countries where  
we operate. We vary employee benefits based on local customs 
and norms.480
RETIREMENT 
BENEFITS4.1 FedEx offers pension and 401(k) retirement plans to eligible team members in the 
United States. These plans together currently have a participation rate of 85 percent.
We encourage team members to participate in 
retirement benefit plans and offer education programs to boost involvement. For example, in FY14, FedEx Retirement Services, together with Vanguard, the world’s largest mutual fund company, worked to help foster team member participation in the FedEx retirement savings plans and to save enough to get the full  
company match. The campaign targeted eligible, active team members who were not taking 
advantage of the Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) 
or the FedEx Office 401(k) Plan. For the RSP, of 
those who received the communication, nearly 
8 percent enrolled in the Plan with an average 
savings rate of 5.28 percent. For the FedEx 
Office 401(k) Plan, of those who received the 
communication, 4.75 percent enrolled in the 
Plan with an average savings rate of 5.4 percent.
HEALTHY PEOPLE,  
HEALTHY BUSINESS4.2
FedEx promotes health and wellness through investments in health-focused programs 
and health care benefits. FedEx has a history of providing competitive health care coverage to our team members. We cover most health care costs for our  
U.S. team members eligible for benefit plans, including medical, dental and vision coverage. Team members have access to a 24-hour nurse line, integrated personal health teams and a medical decision support group. For team members not  
eligible, we offer benefits through a third party, allowing individuals to customize plans to meet their unique needs.
We also provide programs through our operating 
companies that support the personal health of our team members. Examples include fitness improvement teams, nutrition education  
programs, wellness blogs, stress-management classes and more. Many of our office buildings provide access to health club services on-site  
or nearby, often at a reduced rate. We also  
try to negotiate reduced rates with local  
childcare centers close to our offices to better 
accommodate parents.FEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLE
HEALTHWAYS  
WELL-BEING PROGRAM4.3 In July 2014, FedEx launched the Healthways Well-Being Program to make it easier 
for team members to take simple steps toward wellness. FedEx teamed up with Healthways, a leader in well-being improvement, to offer team members personalized resources to better manage their health and improve their overall well-being.
A key component of the program provides 
FedEx team members with the option to enroll in a highly personalized long-term weight loss program developed with Johns Hopkins Medicine. For two years, participating team members get personalized coaching through phone-based sessions and online resources to help make changes that lead to weight loss.
One FedEx employee, John Dyson, Director of 
HR for FedEx Corporate Services, enrolled in the program and lost 35 pounds in 12 weeks. Not only is John losing the weight that was advised by his cardiologist, but he’s feeling better and 
enjoying activities like walking with his spouse.
“I’ve tried various diets,” states John, “but I 
enjoy this process where larger goals are  
tackled through incremental small steps and 
goal-setting.”
FedEx also opened a new Center for Workforce 
Well-Being within our headquarters facility in 
Memphis, Tenn., in October 2014. Staff at the 
center offer well-being coaching and direct 
team members to wellness programming.81

WORK-LIFE BALANCE4.4
The stress that comes with balancing the pressures of modern life can affect  
personal health and work performance. The FedEx Work-Life Balance Program helps 
team members better manage day-to-day responsibilities through web-based resources on topics such as parenting, child and adult care, financial matters and more. It’s yet another way we can support our people and move possibilities  
and solutions forward as an employer.
Our FedEx TechConnect REACH (Reps Engaged 
and Connected@Home) program supports team members that work from home. Sixteen of our 20 U.S. call centers are staffed by team members that work from home. In FY14, the 
program expanded to six new cities, including 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Kansas City, Kan.; Atlanta; 
Salt Lake City; Dallas; and El Segundo, Calif.FEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLE
FedEx Custom Critical, our operating company that provides urgent delivery services, created the FedEx Fitness Challenge in 2013 to encourage team members to make health and wellness a priority. The fitness challenge was designed to include all team members, regardless of their current fitness, and help each participant attain a personal fitness target.One participant, Roy Pietras, Claims & Risk Administrator at FedEx Custom Critical, credits the program with helping him get more fit. “After going to the doctor, the numbers were laid out for me…blood pressure, sugar, et cetera. I had to do something to reduce it. I really wanted to get up and start motivating myself. So I began to walk at lunch every day. My goal was to do 10,000 steps a day, and I’m pretty consistent.  
I feel better. I sleep better. I’m more alert.”

WOMEN IN THE 
WORKPLACE5.1 The shipping and logistics industry has traditionally suffered from a lack of  
gender diversity. This has limited talent across the field, something that we  
are proactively working to change. Women currently make up a significant  
pro p ortion of our workforce and represent over one-fifth of our management 
team members globally.
We work to promote women into managerial 
and leadership roles and see this as a key factor in our future business success. We are taking proactive steps to increase networking and mentoring opportunities for women at FedEx and offer programs that support women’s advancement. In addition, we are seeking to  add more female drivers to the FedEx team. 
Nationally, there is a driver shortage, and 
 attracting women into the workforce offers

FedEx with a largely untapped pool of potential team members, but it provides opportunities to women seeking strong salaries and benefits.83

EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT THROUGH GROUP EXPERIENCES (EDGE)
FedEx Ground launched the Education and  
Development through Group Experiences (EDGE) program in FY14 to help develop female leaders within the organization. Twenty-four women participated in two in-person retreats that focused on team building, leadership skills and developing peer-to-peer connections. Following the activities, the women continued to meet 
through virtual workshops over the next nine 
months to expand upon the learnings and  
connections made during the retreats. The second 
EDGE experience launched in September 2014, 
and a third is planned for FY15.DIVERSITY OF U.S. WORKFORCE

In FY14, we created a five-part series of blog 
posts  profiling inspiring women in aviation. In 
March 2014, we also published a Female Pilots 
article  to coincide with International Women’s 
Day. We feel that sharing these narratives can inspire others, help dispel gender stereotypes about aviation and highlight great work happening in the field.One of the women highlighted was Molly Boss, 
a FedEx pilot based in the Hong Kong hub. 
Molly salutes the fact that women have started 
to make their mark on this profession. She 
notes that women often have unique skill sets 
that complement those of their male counter -
parts in the cockpit.
Mary Murphy, a FedEx Fleet Captain based  
in Memphis, Tenn., was another woman we 
highlighted:
“With great support and encouragement from my 
parents and a few amazing mentors, I navigated 
the successes and the setbacks of an aviation 
journey that led me to my current position as a 
Fleet Captain for FedEx B757/B767 aircraft. 
FedEx, both personally and professionally, has 
given me the wonderful opportunity for career 
growth and work-life balance, keeping me fulfilled 
as a pilot, as a wife, as a mother and, yes, as a 
woman in aviation.”
FedEx also fosters the growth of women in avi -
ation through our support of Women in Aviation 
International, a nonprofit organization dedicated 
to assisting women in the traditionally male-  
dominated aviation and aerospace industries.WOMEN IN AVIATIONFEDEX FY14 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT —PEOPLE
PROMOTING WORKFORCE 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION5.2 Attracting and retaining a diverse workforce is a key priority for our business. Our 
success requires that we provide exceptional service to an increasingly diverse customer base, and we are equally committed to a diverse workforce. To support this, the FedEx Enterprise Diversity and Inclusion Alliance Team meets frequently to oversee company-wide diversity initiatives.
In the United States, FedEx collaborates with 
minority and women-centered organizations, as well as university groups, to support our diversity recruitment strategy. Veterans are also an important group that we prioritize in our recruiting. In FY14, we hosted a Virtual Career Session where FedEx veteran team members spoke directly with U.S. military installations world -
wide. Team members shared their experiences transitioning from military life to corporate  
America, discussed available career paths across FedEx and reviewed best practices for resume building, networking and interviewing.Each FedEx operating company also oversees 
its own Diversity and Inclusion Teams that work 
to implement policies, multicultural program -
ming and workplace inclusion initiatives. For 
example, in FY14:
•
  F edEx Freight launched a 15-member 
Executive Diversity Council that meets bi-monthly to develop and implement  
company-wide diversity and inclusion strate -
gies. FedEx Freight also has a 200-member Diversity Council that meets monthly for  
educational web meetings on topics such as stereotypes, celebrating diversity and cultural competence.
