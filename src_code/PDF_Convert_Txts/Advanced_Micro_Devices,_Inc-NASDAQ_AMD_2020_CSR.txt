world. From helping students learn to creating innovative new therapies  
for veterans to mapping the universe we live in — AMD technology is opening new doors to a better world. 
LEARN MORE AT  AMD.COM/CORPORATERESPONSIBILITYIn 1995, AMD issued its first annual corporate responsibility report to 
recognize the importance of being a good corporate citizen, partner,  
and neighbor in a global community. After 25 years, our commitment  
to corporate responsibility has grown and evolved to include support 
for STEM education, responsible sourcing of materials, improvements 
in product energy efficiency, protection of workers in our supply chain 
and new approaches to community volunteerism. In everything we do, 
we are committed to diversity and inclusion.
As the world battles the COVID-19 global pandemic, AMD is supporting 
our communities and applying our technology and resources to the 
fight. We are providing financial support for medical services and 
humanitarian relief, donating personal protection equipment to medical 
professionals, and prioritizing and expediting product shipments 
to medical customers like the AMD embedded processors used in 
ventilators and respirators.  We are particularly proud to be contributing 
more than 15 million dollars’ worth of high-performance computing 
technology and expertise to accelerate medical research that will enable 
some of the world’s brightest minds to develop therapies and possible 
vaccines for COVID-19.
Recent events have also been a painful reminder of the work still ahead 
to end racism and social injustice. AMD is committed to increasing the 
number of women and under-represented minorities in the technology 
industry, and to supporting efforts to effect systemic and lasting change.
Through this challenging time and beyond, AMD will support our 
employees, customers, and the communities around the world we call 
home and continue to deliver technology and products that are needed 
now more than ever.

ADVANCING GENOME SCIENCE:  
INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH  
HIGHER THREAD COUNTS 
OSU’S CENTER FOR GENOME RESEARCH AND BIOCOMPUTING 
CAN DO MORE SCIENCE WITH EPYC™ PROCESSOR CORE AND THREAD COUNTS 
What do snow leopards, eucalyptus, Phytophthora fungi, corn, and 
rice all have in common? They, as well as Oregon State University’s mascot the North American beaver, have had their genomes sequenced at the university’s Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB). 
The sequencing is just the start of conducting science based 
on genomics, according to Chris Sullivan, Assistant Director of Biocomputing at the CGRB. The next critical work is genomic sequence alignment, the prerequisite to comparing and analyzing genomes by arranging DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to find similar regions. “We take these small strings of data and we align them to these massive genomes, ” said Sullivan. 
“WE HAVE APPLICATIONS REQUIRING 100-PLUS THREADS, AND 
ONLY AMD EPYC PROCESSORS HAVE REALLY STEPPED INTO THAT PLAY BY GIVING US THAT 128 THREAD COUNT.”

ACCELERATING DRUG DISCOVERY:  
A REVOLUTION IN THE QUEST FOR  
NEW TREATMENTS 
SYMMETRIC COMPUTING DISCOVERS NEW DRUGS FASTER  
WITH AMD EPYC™ AND RADEON INSTINCT™ TECHNOLOGY 
Finding cures for the most common and life-threatening diseases 
takes a huge amount of time and effort. Theories need to be devised, potential drug regimens designed, and then there will be years of testing before a new drug can be proven to be effective, safe, and ready to be delivered to patients. But what if you could accelerate that process, using simulations on supercomputers to find the drug formulations with the best potential for success before time-consuming clinical trials begin?
This is the approach taken by Symmetric Computing in its work with 
medical researchers. Employing AMD EPYC™ processors and Radeon Instinct™ accelerators, Symmetric has been able to speed up the process of finding potential drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Diabetes, and other diseases. 
“WE CAN ALSO PUT FOUR HEAD NODES TOGETHER AND GET 8TB 
OF ADDRESSABLE MEMORY...WITH 256 CORES ACROSS FOUR SERVERS, THE EPYC PROCESSOR PLATFORM IS REALLY  
A MAINFRAME AT A TENTH OF THE COST.”
