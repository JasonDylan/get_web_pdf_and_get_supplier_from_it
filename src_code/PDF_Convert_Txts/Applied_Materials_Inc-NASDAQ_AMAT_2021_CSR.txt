Applied Materials has the industry’s broadest 
and most enabling portfolio of materials 
engineering solutions used to produce 
virtually every chip and advanced display 
in the world. We recognize that this unique 
leadership position comes with tremendous 
responsibility to our employees, customers 
and society.
In fiscal 2021, as the world continued to 
adapt to the impacts of COVID-19 and 
global supply chain disruptions challenged 
the resilience of every industry, Applied 
made strong progress toward our 10-year 
sustainability roadmap. Our comprehensive 
2030 strategy considers the magnitude 
of our opportunities including social and 
environmental impacts in our operations (1X), 
how we work with customers and suppliers 
(100X), and how our technology can be used to advance sustainability on a global scale 
(10,000X). Here are just a few highlights of 
our recent progress:
 >Reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions  
and increased our use of renewable 
electricity, remaining on track to 
achieve our 2030 goals. 
 >Quantified our full Scope 3 emissions 
inventory  for our 2019 baseline and 
reported our carbon impact and risks 
in-line with the Task Force on Climate 
Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
 >Advanced our 3x30 and SuCCESS2030 
goals,  including accelerating sustainable 
innovation, improving the longevity of 
our products, and enabling our suppliers 
to better meet our ESG expectations.   >Strengthened our Culture of Inclusion 
by providing comprehensive diversity 
training to all senior leaders and a 
majority of employees worldwide and 
increased the representation of women 
and underrepresented minorities in our 
company—though we know we have to 
do much more to reach our targets. 
 >Conducted our first human rights 
salience assessment, which builds 
on our Human Rights Statement of 
Principles . We will report on our progress 
toward these topics in future years.
 >Completed an equity audit of 
our community involvement and 
investments, and committed to 
put equity at the center of all future 
community engagements.
In this 2021 Sustainability Report, you will 
learn how we lead with purpose  and support 
our local communities; invest in people  to 
create a vibrant culture of inclusion where 
every Applied employee is empowered to 
grow and thrive in their careers; protect our 
planet  by reducing our direct and indirect 
impacts; and innovate for progress  across our 
global supply chain. The opportunity for technology to shape 
a more equitable and sustainable world 
has never been more promising. Applied 
Materials remains steadfast in our 
commitment to work across this ecosystem 
to drive critical advances that will accelerate 
a sustainable and inclusive digital economy 
and Make Possible® a Better Future for all 
generations to come.

Sustainability Report 2021 8T o strengthen our focus and improve our performance  
on potential environmental, social, and governance issues, 
Applied conducted a corporate responsibility materiality* 
assessment in 2021 using the Datamaran platform. Corporate Responsibility 
Materiality Assessment
This automated solution helped us 
comprehensively review a wide range of 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) topics to identify those ESG issues 
most important to our stakeholders 
and where Applied may effect the most 
significant progress to Make Possible a 
Better Future.
T o ensure the most comprehensive 
identification of relevant issues, the 
assessment analyzed impacts using a 
double-materiality lens: assessing ESG 
factors likely to impact Applied as well 
as factors that our activities may impact. 
The assessment includes insights from key stakeholders, including customers, 
investors, suppliers, policy makers, 
regulators, media, industries and peers,  
as well as internal Applied stakeholders. 
All the issues identified as critical in the 
matrix are discussed in this report. Though 
this exercise has affirmed the company’s 
prioritization of ESG issues that are most 
strategic and impactful for Applied, such 
as climate change, energy, supply chain 
resilience, diversity and inclusion, and  
human rights, Applied will continue to 
reassess relative priorities, which may  
shift in the future.* Materiality in this context and in this report refers to the relative significance of  
ESG issues in the context of our ESG program, and does not refer to the concept  
of materiality used in financial reporting, securities, or other applicable law. Importance to Stakeholders

PROGRESSSustainability Report 202110In 2021, the continuing pandemic, historic 
global supply chain disruptions, increasing 
impacts of climate change and social 
inequities, and growing geopolitical unrest 
challenged nearly all aspects of society 
and businesses. At the same time, the 
transformation to a digital economy 
continued to accelerate at breakneck speed, 
tightening pressure on the semiconductor 
industry to scale at an unprecedented pace.
As the global leader in materials engineering, 
Applied Materials is uniquely positioned 
to drive significant, meaningful, and lasting 
environmental and social impact across the 
world. We recognize this position comes with 
tremendous responsibility and accountability 
to our employees, customers, partners, 
investors, and society. 
Applied takes a strong stance on corporate 
governance, holding ourselves to high 
standards of ethics and integrity, privacy, 
and data security. Throughout 2021, 
we continued a systematic review and sharpening of our governance policies 
and procedures to protect our business 
and stakeholders amid evolving global 
threats. We engaged leaders, operators, 
and employees in dedicated trainings 
and learning opportunities to reinforce 
awareness, understanding, and compliance 
across our organizations and geographies. 
Our purpose extends to uplifting the 
communities where we live and work as we 
aim to create a more just, fair, and humane 
world. In 2021, we engaged a third-party 
partner to conduct an equity audit of our 
community involvement and investments to 
identify and proactively address unintentional 
barriers arising from bias, norms, or systemic 
structures. Building on the outcomes of 
this audit, we made a public declaration  to 
center our community investments in equity, 
evolving how we approach grantmaking, 
employee engagement, and personal and 
professional development. Leading with purpose means putting our core values  
at the center of our actions and decisions as we Make 
Possible a Better Future.

and road shows. Throughout our business 
units, designated Compliance Champions 
promote ethics and compliance, intellectual 
property protection and mandatory 
training completion, and serve as trusted 
local contacts employees can approach 
with questions or concerns. In 2021, we 
established regional compliance committees 
across our global operations, comprised of 
local leaders from the Legal and Compliance 
Organization (LCO), Finance, HR, and 
business units. These committees enable 
local implementation of initiatives, provide 
regional feedback and recommendations, and 
further drive our culture of integrity. In 2022, we are launching a cross-functional 
Global Compliance Oversight Committee 
(GCOC) to enable the business with global

details regional, global and cross-functional 
compliance policies and procedures.See the Corporate Governance Addendum  for

Standards of 
Business Conduct
Applied Materials’ Standards of Business 
Conduct communicate our values, set 
expectations for our global workforce and 
network of trusted partners, and provide 
guidance designed to promote the highest 
ethical standards in our interactions 
with customers, suppliers, colleagues, 
communities and other stakeholders. The 
Standards are designed to promote trust 
in management’s commitment to our 
values, empower employees to speak up 
without fear of retaliation, and provide 
comprehensive guidance about risks, laws, 
policies and reporting processes, including 
key concerns such as conflicts of interest, 
bribery and corruption.
Over the past two years we’ve been working 
on updates to our Standards and associated 
policies, procedures, controls and trainings, 
tying them closer to our core values and 
emphasizing relevance to today’s dynamic 
risk environment, everywhere we do business. 
We will complete our Standards update in 
2022, along with the release of a new set of standards for business partners. In 2021, we 
updated our global Anti-Corruption Policy 
and our Gifts, Meals, Entertainment and 
T ravel (GMET) Policy. We also updated our 
Conflict of Interest (COI) new-hire process 
and added anti-corruption controls to our 
intern recruitment process. 
T o enable real-time data analytics and 
insights regarding compliance with our 
Standards, we maintain a global dashboard 
for tracking conflict-of-interest disclosures, 
corporate donation approval requests and 
GMET approvals. 
We are currently in the process of building 
out and automating key elements of our 
third-party anti-corruption due diligence 
procedures, and in 2021 we transitioned to 
conducting regular third-party audits.

localized anti-corruption training across 
our APAC region and micro-learning and 
awareness campaigns designed to provide 
process refreshers and support ethical

Associations
Applied Materials maintains memberships in 
various business and trade associations that 
advance issues aligned with our corporate 
strategy and the needs of our company, 
industry, employees, and communities. 
Our membership in a group does not imply 
that we endorse the entirety of that group’s 
policy positions.
In 2021, Applied paid approximately 
$578,000 in trade association membership 
dues, 18% of which were specified by the 
associations as non-deductible lobbying 
expenditures. This total does not include 
conference or event sponsorships, 
programming activities or similar costs. 
Applied Materials reports on federal 
lobbying through the Lobbying Disclosure 
Act Database, and files periodic reports with 
federal and state agencies as appropriate.
Our U.S. T rade and Business Associations 
membership list can be found here .Political Contributions
The Applied Materials, Inc. Political Action 
Committee (AMPAC) contributes to federal 
candidates, political action committees 
and party committees supporting issues of 
strategic importance to Applied, consistent 
with all legal requirements. Our State 
Contributions Committee oversees corporate 
political spending to advance those strategic 
issues at the state and local levels. 
While Applied pays the administrative 
expenses for AMPAC, AMPAC is funded 
entirely through voluntary contributions 
from eligible employees, and does not make 
any contributions using Applied Materials 
corporate funds. AMPAC’s activities are 
overseen, and its contributions reviewed 
and approved, by the AMPAC Board of 
Directors. Contributions are based solely 
on corporate objectives, without regard for 
the private political preferences of either 
the employees who contribute to AMPAC 
or individual committee members. During 
2021, political contributions made by 
AMPAC totaled $24,600.

to Center Equity
As part of a multi-year journey to evaluate 
and improve the Applied Materials 
Foundation and Applied Materials’ U.S.-
based engagement in communities of color, 
our Community Affairs team partnered 
with Black-owned consulting firm Frontline 
Solutions in 2021 to conduct an equity 
assessment examining Foundation and 
company programs and practices. The team 
dedicated time to listening, learning, and 
reflecting on issues of equity, prejudice, 
power, and privilege, seeking to identify and 
proactively address unintentional barriers 
arising from bias, norms, or systemic 
structures. We also surveyed recent grantees 
on the degree to which company and 
Foundation programs and practices center 
equity. Based on audit results and feedback, 
we made a public declaration  of commitment 
to equity-centered community involvement 
focused across three core areas: >Grantmaking: Applied and the 
Foundation will make data-driven 
assessments of how organizations 
include the voice of the community 
in the issue they seek to address, to 
ensure we are funding organizations 
with the deep community trust 
required to achieve their goals. To 
increase transparency, we will post 
grant recipients of both Foundation 
and company grants on our website 
beginning in 2022.
 >Employee Engagement: The 
Community Affairs team will work 
with community leaders, our Employee 
Resource Groups, and an outside vendor 
to identify high-impact nonprofits led by 
and serving people of color to promote 
a greater variety of volunteer and other 
community engagement opportunities 
for Applied employees.
 >Personal and Professional 
Development: To ensure that company 
and Foundation decision-making 
structures and Community Affairs 
operations are centered in equity, we 
will conduct internal team learning 
activities to address biases and norms 
that negatively impact communities 
and organizations of color.

Sustainability Report 202123Responding to Acute 
Community Need
Applied Materials, the Applied Materials 
Foundation, and our 27,000 employees 
remain flexible in providing funding for 
communities severely impacted by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and 
systemic racism.
For the past two-plus years, Applied and 
the Foundation have stepped up to help 
those most impacted by the COVID-19 
pandemic. These efforts have included 
providing financial support to U.S. food banks 
and global relief organizations, delivering 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and 
other supplies to frontline medical personnel, 
providing hand sanitizer to senior programs and homeless shelters, and ensuring 
disadvantaged children and their families 
have access to nutritious meals. In 2021, 
the Foundation partnered with the Indian-
American Friendship Alliance to deliver 
oxygen concentrators to India during that 
country’s deadly Delta variant surge.
As Asian-Americans faced a wave of racist 
violence across the U.S. inspired by COVID-19 
misinformation and anti-Asian rhetoric, the 
Foundation donated to Asian Americans 
Advancing Justice to support their efforts to 
document hate and demand action.
In the wake of the February 2021 ice storms 
that disrupted power grids across T exas, the 
Foundation provided funding to Caritas of 
Austin and the American Red Cross to aid 
community relief efforts.Promoting Civic 
Development
In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued 
to adversely affect nonprofit organizations 
and the way they provide services. Applied 
and the Foundation responded by providing 
infrastructural support to 94 community 
organizations, helping them become more 
efficient and grow their capacity to serve 
local needs, including through advocating for 
affordable housing and helping families in 
need access housing and income assistance. 
Through joint support from Applied and the 
Foundation, we hope to prevent families from 
becoming homeless and to fund supportive 
services and shelter for those who are already 
without a home. The following examples 
illustrate this approach in 2021:
 > In response to high numbers of 
homeless youth in Portland, Oregon, 
and Austin, Texas, the Foundation 
funded organizations such as New 
Avenues for Youth and LifeWorks, 
which help transition homeless youth to 
stable and safe housing. > In Silicon Valley, the Foundation 
provided financial support for the 
expansion of the Sunnyvale Community 
Services facility. With three times 
more space, the new building allows 
improvements in the management 
and delivery of current services and 
the opportunity to offer new support 
services to individuals and families. 
 > In Arizona, the Foundation supported 
House of Refuge, Inc. and UMOM New 
Day Centers, Inc., which serve families 
in transition, provide safe housing and 
offer wrap-around services that help 
families become financially stable. 
 > In India, Applied supported SOS 
Children’s Villages, an organization 
providing homes, nurturing care and 
educational support for children who 
have been abandoned or orphaned.

 Sustainability Report 2021 24Fight Against Hunger
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has 
exacerbated longstanding societal inequities, 
with historically excluded communities 
experiencing the most severe impact. In the 
first year of the pandemic, organizations 
working to alleviate food insecurity at the 
community level reported a 100% increase 
in demand for their services. While demand 
decreased slightly in 2021, it remained above 
historical norms, and food banks had to 
contend with additional pressures from high 
food and transportation costs, supply chain 
delays, and a lack of volunteers. 
T o do our part in addressing these 
challenges, Applied employee teams across 
North America closed out the year with our 
annual Fight Against Hunger fundraising 
effort. During the campaign, which 
remained primarily virtual to prioritize 
health and safety, our employees raised 
$1.9 million, our most generous employee 
donation total ever. Adding a dollar-for-
dollar match from the Applied Materials 
Foundation, we were able to distribute over 
$3.8 million to 52 food banks across the 
U.S. and Canada.Global Fight Against Hunger efforts 
continued throughout the year, often 
aligned with cultural and seasonal holidays 
in different countries. In Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Japan, and T aiwan, employee 
efforts benefited food banks. In Greece, our 
people supported The Smile of the Child’s 
work providing meals to children living in 
poverty. In India, employee giving targeted 
mid-day meals for students through the 
Akshaya Patra Foundation, as well as year-
round support for orphans living in group 
homes. In China, our people filled and 
distributed food packages, and in Israel 
they supported the delivery of meals to 
Holocaust survivors. All these efforts reflect 
Applied’s values and purpose, aligning who 
we are with what matters to our employees 
and what’s needed in our communities.INTRODUCTION

PROGRESSSustainability Report 2021 2525Generation Girl® 
Initiative
In a time of renewed focus on diversity 
and empowerment across industry and 
society, the Applied Materials Foundation’s 
Generation Girl® initiative continued 
its efforts to ensure that girls have the 
opportunity to reach their full potential.
The Generation Girl initiative works 
with nonprofit organizations throughout 
the United States to help girls gain the 
confidence, skills, and opportunities they 
need to succeed. In recognition of the 
fact that women of color remain the tech 
industry’s most underrepresented group, the 
program prioritizes funding for organizations 
serving Black, Latinx, and Indigenous girls as 
well as girls from low-income backgrounds. 
By working to break down societal and 
systemic barriers and develop talent in 
underrepresented communities, we can help 
make our future workplaces more vibrant, 
equitable and effective.During the grant period that began in 
September 2020 and ran through August 
2021, the Generation Girl initiative 
provided close to $1 million to 28 nonprofit 
organizations serving girls in six U.S. regions 
where Applied maintains facilities, with 
89% of funded programs focusing on girls 
in middle and high school. Foundation 
funding enabled grantees to deliver virtual, 
hybrid, and/ or in-person after-school and 
summer programming and connect girls and 
their caregivers to local community service 
agencies to address need. All told, grantees 
were able to serve almost 6,000 girls, 69% of 
whom identify as Black, Latinx, or Indigenous 
and 64% of whom come from low-income 
backgrounds. While girls continued to face 
barriers to program participation—including 
cancellation of large in-person events, 
increased caregiving responsibilities, and 
virtual learning burnout—impact on the girls 
served remained strong, with over 75% of 
participants reporting growth in research-
based girls empowerment outcomes, STEM 
interest, and STEM confidence.T

PROGRESSThroughout 2021, the Foundation continued 
to facilitate learning through bimonthly 
meetings of the Community of Practice 
(CoP), in which representatives from the 
30 grantee organizations met virtually 
to discuss common challenges, share 
success stories, and pursue partnership 
opportunities. In 2021, the group focused on 
the pandemic’s impact on girls, strategies 
for supporting girls who have experienced 
trauma, delivering service to hard-to-
reach communities and plans to resume 
in-person services in various regions. All 
of the participating organizations gave 
these meetings high marks for fostering 
collaboration and a community of support 
during difficult times. 
Applied employee volunteers remain a 
vital component to the Generation Girl 
initiative, teaching girls about careers in the 
semiconductor industry and inspiring them 
to dream big. In 2021, Applied employees 
across the U.S. volunteered more than ever 
with girl-serving organizations such as the 
Society of Women Engineers–Santa Clara 
Valley, GirlStart, Girls on the Run Silicon 
Valley, Latinitas and the Girls Empowerment 
Network—conducting virtual career exploration sessions, serving as volunteer 
mentors, and leading online activities that 
introduce girls to microchips and more. The 
virtual environment helped break down 
regional barriers to volunteerism, connecting 
women engineers in Montana with high 
school girls in New Jersey, female technical 
project managers in Silicon Valley with 
aspiring coders in Austin, and remote college 
recruiting staff with young women pursuing 
computer science degrees across the U.S. 
In October, employees came together in 
celebration of International Day of the Girl to 
listen to leaders from Alliance for Girls and 
T echBridge Girls speak about the impact of 
the pandemic on girls in the U.S. They then 
turned that knowledge into action through 
participation in a mentorship forum with 
female high school students participating in 
the Y esSheCan Campaign.

girls become confident leaders and innovators. From the U.S. 
to India, China, T aiwan, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Israel, 
the company, our employees, and our Women’s Professional 
Development Network Employee Resource Group (ERG) hosted 
activities such as panel discussions on further cultivating 
Applied’s Culture of Inclusion, a working mom’s conversation, 
networking sessions, virtual volunteering opportunities, 
informational videos telling the stories of women at Applied, 
and daily stories and calls to action.

continuously to give students worldwide 
equitable access to high-quality education. 
In FY2021, Applied Materials and the 
Foundation provided $2,828,701 in funding  
to 63 educational initiatives.Throughout the year, as COVID-19 waves 
forced many schools to cycle between 
distance, hybrid and in-person learning, we 
remained flexible in our funding decisions. 
We listened to school and community 
leaders, and Applied and the Foundation 
jointly provided needed tools to reach 
kids where they are, address learning loss 
challenges and bolster teacher enthusiasm. 
Applied and the Foundation funded programs 
to address the mental health needs of kids 
returning to classrooms and supported high-
quality STEM education programs so kids 
from all backgrounds and income levels can 
envision future careers in technology. Highlights at the local level included:
 >Flexible support in East San José, 
California. The Foundation worked 
closely with school districts and 
education nonprofits serving the 
predominantly working-class, 
immigrant families of East San José, 
who have been disproportionately 
impacted by the pandemic. Foundation 
grantees City Year San José/Silicon 
Valley and Catholic Charities offered 
in-person learning pods for children 
of essential workers and others while 
most students learned remotely. 
When schools reopened onsite, 
these organizations maintained their 
commitment to student learning 
through in-school support and after-
school enrichment programs.
 > Professional development for 
teachers in Austin, Texas. In the 
Manor Independent School District, 
the Foundation funded a program that 
trains teachers in new strategies for 
equitably and effectively engaging 
students during distance learning.  >Illuminating career pathways in 
Massachusetts. Foundation grantees 
including Leap for Education and 
Gloucester Marine Genomics Institute 
were able to offer in-person experiential 
learning and career exploration projects 
that introduced youth to career 
pathways while complying with public 
health guidelines.
 > Taking science programs online 
in Korea. Applied expanded our 
relationship with ChildFund Korea, 
providing funding to convert 
experimental science lessons to an 
online format for distance learning. 
 > Improving online STEM access in 
Taiwan. Applied supported efforts 
by the Association of Taiwan Online 
Education Development to improve 
access to online STEM programs by 
creating science experiments and other 
online resources for 5th to 9th graders, 
all available free to teachers.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a 
devastating impact on arts organizations 
whose mission depends heavily on in-person 
programming. Following a year in which 
organizations pivoted with varying success 
to streaming and on-demand programming, 
2021 saw many evolving to meet our greater 
understanding of COVID-19 transmission by 
offering experiential, often family-oriented 
and culturally diverse programming in a 
safer outdoor environment. T o support those

Recruitment
Our diverse talent recruiting seeks 
candidates from the technology industry 
and related fields and attracts talented new 
college graduates (NCGs) from universities 
with strong engineering and science 
programs—including U.S. schools with large 
Black and Hispanic student populations. 
Through STEM education initiatives with 
colleges, universities and nonprofit partners 
serving middle and high school students, we 
are also building a pipeline of future talent.
Over the past two years, we’ve pursued a 
range of initiatives and technologies to help 
us achieve our diversity goals:
 > Introducing a Diverse Talent Sourcing  
Platform that enables searches for 
diverse candidates > Rolling out a global Talent Selection 
Playbook  that helps managers define 
their talent needs, then assess and 
select the most appropriate candidates
 >Doubling our referral bonus 
program  to reward employees for 
recommending successful candidates 
for customer engineering and other 
technical roles
 > Expanding talent searches  beyond our 
physical operating regions to broaden 
our potential talent pool
 > Recruiting military talent  as they exit 
the U.S. services
These initiatives and others have contributed 
to an increase in the representation of 
global women, U.S. women and U.S. URM 
employees at Applied.As leaders in the technology industry, our total 
commitment to inclusion and diversity informs and 
enables all our practices for attracting, recruiting, 
hiring and onboarding a top-performing workforce. 
In 2021, continuing pandemic challenges and a 
hyper-competitive labor market complicated the 
task of meeting our growing skill needs, especially in 
semiconductor technologies.Recruiting and Hiring
Supporting the Everywhere Workplace
In 2021, we implemented a new alternative workplace location process, 
enabling flexibility for our employees when personal circumstances arise. 
By supporting remote, flexible models, we are better able to recruit and 
retain the best talent for our teams.INTRODUCTION

environmental and sustainability challenges, 
shrinking gender equity discrepancies, or 
promoting a more inclusive workplace, these 
efforts make me love working at a global 
company that listens to employees and leverages

Sales Account ManagerRecruiting and Hiring 
in Challenging Times
Throughout 2021, we adapted and expanded 
our recruiting, hiring and onboarding 
practices for a challenging labor and work 
environment. Our efforts included:
 > Applied New Hire Experience. As part 
of our MY HR portal, we introduced a 
virtual onboarding process that orients 
new hires to our values, mission, 
business organization, locations and 
other essentials, all via modules and 
notifications that promote better 
engagement and information retention. 
The system coordinates with the 
employee’s manager and a new-hire 
buddy, simplifying and standardizing 
the onboarding process.  > New College Graduate Rotation 
Programs. To drive in-depth, cross-
functional training, provide access 
to a global knowledge database and 
assure optimal placement of new hires, 
internal organizations including Supply 
Chain, Finance (Austin and Silicon 
Valley), and Implant (Gloucester) 
offered rotation programs that 
included mentoring, networking, skills 
development and hands-on experience 
across various areas of their operation. 
 > Virtual Internships. In North America 
and globally, our virtual internship 
programs continued giving students 
exposure to our diverse and inclusive 
workplace and introducing them 
to career paths and roles in both 
engineering and corporate. In the U.S., 
we hired a total of 143 interns, 53% of 
whom were female.
 > China New Star Program. Spanning  
12 Applied locations in China, this  
NCG program saw 13% female new 
hires in 2021.

 Sustainability Report 2021Applied Inclusion:  
It Starts with Me
While leaders play a central role in driving 
organizational change, making that change 
sustainable takes everyone, at every level of 
our global enterprise. 
It means embracing change as a philosophy, not 
just tweaking the tactics and strategies of the 
past. At its most basic level, it’s about breaking 
the cycle of looks-like-me hiring, going beyond 
expectations of background, education and 
experience to see new possibilities. However, DEI has to be more holistic than 
just talent, embracing an expansive and 
empathetic mindset that not only sees but 
seeks the value in difference and works toward 
that ideal in everything we do, including:
 > Identifying more diverse suppliers
 > Respecting and celebrating all 
individuals
 > Creating safe spaces where all voices 
can be heard
 > Reinventing our culture to value a 
healthier work/life balance
 > Embedding that culture of respect, 
empathy, and collaboration across our 
strategy and business processes2021 Global Culture of 
Inclusion Summit
While the definition of diversity may vary from country to country, the 
concepts of equity and inclusion are universal and set us up for a future of 
greater collaboration, innovation, and financial performance. That was the 
message of our October 2021 virtual Global Culture of Inclusion Summit, 
which netted the participation of more than 2,800 global employees and 
contingent workers. Around the world, from the U.S. and Europe to China, 
India, Singapore, T aiwan, Korea, and Japan, Applied’s teams hosted speakers 
and local training on topics such as developing an inclusive mindset, 
learning and operationalizing the traits of Inclusive Leadership, overcoming 
multi-generational issues, reducing identity-covering in the workplace, and 
becoming an LGBTQIA+ ally. Featured speakers at the summit included:

PROGRESSSustainability Report 202140Engaging Leaders as 
Champions of Change
As our Culture of Inclusion effort intensifies, 
Applied Materials’ leaders are investing 
in their own awareness as an essential 
component of driving change.
In 2021, we launched our virtual, half-day 
Inclusive Leader Summits, experiential 
learning opportunities designed to reinforce 
and extend last year’s learnings about  
leading courageously on race and racial 
equity. T argeted at the 400 members of 
our Applied Leadership Group (ALG), the 
workshops achieved an 87% attendance  
rate, including leadership from our Europe 
and Israel operations.
Fifteen of our U.S. leaders also participated 
in a pilot Coaching for Inclusion program 
through the Berkeley Executive Coaching 
Institute. Building on previous diversity 
training that focused on gaining a deeper 
understanding of inclusion challenges and 
making inclusion personal, the Berkeley 
program is designed to give leaders the skills 
and tools to learn across difference to drive 
meaningful, sustainable change. Its focus includes:
 > Building core capabilities and helping 
leaders develop an authentic leadership 
presence around DEI
 > Building empathy and an 
understanding of how DEI issues 
affect oneself and others
 > Becoming more conscious of how 
personal behaviors can unintentionally 
reinforce unproductive dynamicsThe program is delivered via an initial two-
day session, coaching, independent study, 
and a follow-up workshop. For 2022, we 
intend to take this program global, training 
three cohorts of 21 leaders apiece, including 
in our Asia-Pacific operation.
Our Inclusive Leader Action Guide, 
introduced in the first half of 2021, 
continued to serve as a resource for our 
executive staff and people managers, 
providing pragmatic strategies and best 
practices for becoming more inclusive 
leaders, partners, and change catalysts.These efforts build on changes introduced in 
prior years to help our leaders take Applied 
Materials in the direction we need to go—
such as introducing diversity dashboards that 
allow U.S. leaders to track progress against 
diversity goals for each organization, and 
tying executive compensation directly to the 
achievement of our diversity objectives via 
our Corporate Scorecard.
Our COI progress is shared on a quarterly 
basis with our Board of Directors. Over the 
past several years our Board itself has grown 
more diverse, and now consists of 40% 
women and 30% people of color.

2021 Inclusion 
Highlights
Throughout 2021, the majority of our 
employees participated in DEI learning 
opportunities, including virtual, on-demand 
courses focused on three areas:
 > The Inclusive Manager Toolkit : 
Explains actions managers can take to 
increase inclusion, engagement, and 
team performance, with an emphasis 
on understanding unconscious bias, 
awareness of micro-messages, and 
creating psychological safety.  
  >Inclusive Virtual Meetings:  Examines 
challenges and best practices for 
facilitating inclusive virtual meetings.
 > Unconscious Bias and Micro-inequities: 
Explores the social stereotypes 
individuals can unintentionally 
internalize. The training challenges 
participants to test their automatic 
assumptions, move from micro-
inequities to micro-affirmations, and 
be mindful of the ARTS of Inclusion: 
Appreciation, Respect, Trust and 
Sensitivity.
Employee Resource Groups
An integral part of the Applied Materials experience since 
2001, our ERGs provide forums for learning, exchanging 
ideas, strengthening bonds across and within our employee 
communities, and advising our leaders’ efforts to remove 
systemic barriers to inclusion. T oday, our network includes 
eight ERGs with 25 global chapters:
 > Applied PRIDE
 > Asians in Motion
 > Hispanics in Partnership
 > Leadership Encouraging 
Achievement through 
Diversity and Black 
Employee Network > Male ERG for Equity
 > Veterans Employee Team
 > Women’s Professional

participating in the various fun and cultural 
activities we have organized with the Hispanics 
in Partnership employee resource group. I feel

support LGBTQIA+ rights. In keeping with 
Applied’s annual recognition of PRIDE month, 
in 2021, employees again raised the rainbow 
flag at our headquarters in Silicon Valley 
and more than a dozen other Applied sites 
worldwide. With support from our ERGs and 
regional sites, we also hosted virtual learning 
sessions on allyship, the dimensions of 
gender, and “LGBTQIA+ 101,” plus virtual and 
in-person networking events, lectures, and 
panel discussions.AIM U.S. Events

All training is coordinated centrally and 
aligned with common objectives through 
Applied Global University (AGU), with 
business units and functions providing 
technical and job-specific training and the 
corporate level providing more general 
professional, management, and leadership 
training. Since the onset of the pandemic in 
2020, the vast majority of our training has 
been virtual. Our training and development 
capabilities also include state-of-the-
art training modalities such as AI-based 
simulations and Augmented and Virtual 
Reality (AR/VR) learning capabilities. In-
person, instructor-led training is offered when 
there is significant benefit, consistent with 
applicable COVID safety protocols.At every level, assessment and  
development is conducted in the 
context of both current and future role 
requirements. Our PATHWAY program 
helps our employees create personalized 
learning journeys, while our technical 
talent receives additional specialized 
opportunities to develop knowledge and 
skills. T raining programs for managers and 
executive leadership facilitate preparation 
for progressive roles and support our 
leadership pipeline.New College Graduate 
Mentorship Program
In 2021, we piloted our New College 
Graduate (NCG) Mentorship Program to 
accelerate NCGs’ early-career development, 
broaden their professional networks, and 
provide a beyond-content-knowledge 
learning experience. The pilot program 
paired 180 participants, matched based on 
their professional profiles, program goals, 
skills, and interest across multiple business 
units and job families. Throughout the six-
month program, mentors and mentees were 
enrolled in a self-guided course in which they 
planned, engaged with, and reflected on their 
mentorship sessions.With a program effectiveness rating of 
87%, the mentorship pilot has generated 
meaningful conversations on career goal 
setting and Applied’s vision, mission, and 
leadership, and has furthered our culture 
of coaching and professional development. 
Using the takeaways from the pilot, our next 
phase will be working with stakeholders to 
design custom mentorship programs for 
various internal organizations and regions.Learning and

Our required manager development 
curriculum equips our people for more 
complex challenges and requirements as 
they move up the management chain. For 
example, First-Time Manager development 
includes facilitated workshops and guided 
implementations covering both general  
and company-specific knowledge and skills, 
including relationship- and team-building 
strategies, coaching tools, HR systems and 
processes, and techniques for managing 
conflict, facilitating decision-making, and 
influencing up and across the organization. 
In addition to the enterprise-wide core 
curriculum, targeted programs support 
regional and business-specific  
development needs. 
In 2021, we continued our successful 
Manager Capability Forums, conducting 
multiple virtual sessions that supported 
managers in implementing key company 
change initiatives, including our voluntary 
retirement program and Paid Time Off 
to Flexible Time Off transition. We also 
completed our inaugural Manager T eam 
Effectiveness (MTE)  pilot program, a four- 
to six-month program of training, coaching, 
and practice where managers learn what 
makes a great team, how to diagnose what 
their team needs, and how to implement 
tangible improvements.Executive Leadership 
Development
We apply a powerful, research-based, role-
relevant, and globally applicable framework 
and tool set to serve as the foundation for 
leadership pipeline assessments, selection, 
placement, development, and coaching. 
Executive development plans place priority on 
situational leadership and inclusive leadership, 
and key framework metrics include:
 > Diversity among our leadership team 
and pipeline of future leaders
 > Percentage of executive leadership 
successors with development plans
 > Percentage of executive leadership 
roles with more than one ready-now 
successor
Our Applied Leadership Group (ALG) 
provides our senior leaders (Managing 
Directors, VPs) with learning and 
development opportunities around strategic 
thinking, communication/networking, and 
tools and techniques to support company 
scaling and growth. These opportunities 
expose leaders to key strategic and 
execution opportunities and challenges and 
position them to make faster and better 
business decisions. The ALG meets on a 
quarterly cadence.Technical Talent 
Development
Applied provides ongoing opportunities for 
our technical talent to build greater skills and 
knowledge related to their roles and interest 
areas, including:
 > Technical skill training for a given role 
or area of interest
 > Product training hosted by the product 
business units
 > Deep-dive technical reviews and 
webinars facilitated by internal and 
external expertsT echnical talent may also attend and present 
at virtual and in-person conferences. Our 
own Engineering and T echnology (ET)

majority of our global manufacturing, lab, and 
customer-focused employees continued to work 
in person at Applied locations or customer sites. 
T o keep our employees healthy and informed, 
we maintained elevated on-site safety protocols 
and proactively communicated the evolution 
of those protocols as the Delta and Omicron 
variants surged and waned. We offered a suite 
of health and wellness benefits to address 
our people’s physical and mental needs and 
maintained programs to support work-from-
home employees through the complexities of 
melding work and home life, such as caring for 
school-age children and elders. At our sites in Austin, Gloucester, and 
Kalispell, we worked with local health 
departments to host multiple COVID-19 
vaccination opportunities.
In a November 2021 employee survey, 87%  
of respondents reported high satisfaction with 
Applied Materials’ response to the challenges 
created by COVID-19, nearly 90% gave 
positive marks on role expectation clarity, and 
nearly 80% reported positively on receiving 
regular manager check-ins and recognition.
Throughout 2021, we evolved a number of 
programs and added new benefits based on 
our people’s needs during COVID: > Announced an expansion of our  
100% paid family care and parental 
leave policies to 12 weeks, effective  
January 1, 2022
 > Began defaulting all U.S. employees to 
short-term disability insurance to assure 
wage replacement in case of illness
 > Implemented supplemental sick time 
hours to support employees with 
COVID-related situations 
 > Implemented virtual healthcare access 
across the U.S. through Crossover
 > Allowed carryover of unused childcare 
funds in flexible spending accounts
 > Added additional mindfulness, stress-
reduction and wellness content to 
our virtual offerings through Applied 
Global University > Introduced a virtual Health Fitness 360 
program, offering content on nutrition, 
fitness, yoga and stress management, 
as well as livestreamed classes led by 
trainers from our Austin gym
 > Added a stipend to cover tech 
expenses for our work-from-home 
employees
These policy changes add to efforts begun 
in year one of the pandemic, which included 
standardized sick time across U.S. exempt 
and nonexempt categories, additional 
support for working parents, a suite of health 
and wellness benefits, and a pay-continuity 
policy for employees unable to work on-site 
due to compromising health conditions.

minimize workplace risks, and support 
continuous improvement in our safety 
performance. We use the definitions set by 
the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
for recordable, lost-time, and restricted-day 
injuries. These definitions are implemented 
globally for data gathering and analysis, and we set targets and objectives both 
at the corporate and site level, which 
are embedded into annual performance 
objectives. At the end of each year, we 
analyze results and reset targets for the 
coming year.
T o prioritize safety, many of our factories 
employ 6S, a lean manufacturing concept 
that empowers employees to assess and 
enhance functionality and safety in their 
work areas. After introducing 6S in 2019, 
injury rates fell by 35% in our semiconductor 
manufacturing operations.Applied Materials places high priority on the

Sustainability Report 202153The latest report from the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) advises that our window to keep 
global warming well below 2° Celsius in 
pursuit of 1.5° is closing rapidly, and the 
current trajectory for global emissions 
reductions is not going to get us there.
At Applied, we recognize we have a 
unique opportunity to accelerate the 
transformation to a sustainable digital 
economy. At the same time, we embrace 
our responsibility to significantly reduce  
our own environmental impacts.
In 2021, we gained a more holistic picture 
of those impacts by quantifying our Scope 3 
emissions inventory. This paves the way for 
setting validated science-based targets in 
alignment with the Paris Agreement.
We also completed Phase 2 of our Climate 
Risk Assessment, giving us more insight into 
climate-related risks to our business. These 
insights help inform the strategic investments 
and operational improvements to grow our 
resilience for a rapidly evolving climate. In 
alignment with the T ask Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we 
are sharing insights from this analysis below 
and in our 2021 Report Annex , along with 
insights from the physical risk assessment we 
completed in 2020. 
As our energy demands increase with the 
expansion of our facilities and increasing 
production demands, we continue to drive 
strong progress against our global 100% 
renewable electricity goal. We are 80% of 
the way toward our goal in the U.S., primarily 
through leveraging partnerships with 
community choice aggregators (CCAs) and 
purchasing renewable energy certificates 
(RECs) through our utility providers. Now, 
with our White Mesa Wind Virtual Power 
Purchase Agreement (VPPA) operational, 
we are well positioned to reach our U.S. 
renewable electricity sourcing goal and offset 
a large portion of our U.S. footprint.We are working to reduce our footprint  as we advance 
technology to accelerate a sustainable digital economy.

a third party to conduct a Climate Risk 
Assessment to identify key physical and 
transition risks and opportunities in line 
with TCFD recommendations. In 2020 we 
completed Phase 1, which assessed Applied 
Materials’ physical risks utilizing three 
different Representative Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs) representing low-, 
moderate-, and high-risk climate change 
scenarios for 2019 (baseline), 2030,  
and 2050. The assessment considered Applied’s risk 
exposure across our global operations by 
identifying our highest-risk assets and 
operations based on various chronic and 
acute geographical climate hazard indicators.
Phase 2 of the Climate Risk Assessment 
concluded in March 2022, providing  
insights on Applied’s projected transition 
risks associated with the shift to a low-
carbon economy between 2025 and  
2050. Benchmarked against our industry 
peers, the assessment gauges relative risk 
levels across four key areas in which climate risk mitigation/ adaptation strategies may

emissions totaled 93,272 metric tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), a 28% 
decline from 2020 driven primarily by our 
new VPPA for wind energy in west T exas. 
Our Scope 2 (market-based) emissions fell 
to 49,290 CO2e in 2021, a 38% decrease 
from 2020. However, our location-based

Powering Growth with Renewables
The accelerating digitization of the global economy is creating urgent demand 
for semiconductors, and Applied Materials is mobilizing our enterprise to 
deliver the equipment and expertise to meet that demand. At the same time, 
we understand our success as a business must not come at the expense of 
the climate and environment. 
That’s why we are continually seeking new opportunities in the low-carbon 
economy, such as entering into a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement with 
White Mesa Wind, a new, 500-megawatt wind project in Crockett County, 
T exas. Combining the generating power of 180 turbines, White Mesa began 
commercial operations on October 22, 2021, delivering clean power to 
offset a large percentage of our U.S. footprint. As our business grows, we 
will continue innovating operational efficiencies and seeking new renewable 
energy projects to fulfill our climate commitments.
Sustainability Report 2021Renewable Energy
In 2020, Applied Materials committed 
to 100% renewable electricity use in the 
U.S. by 2022 and globally by 2030. Our 
global renewable energy strategy enables 
achievement of those targets via three 
complementary approaches:
 > On-site solar power generation:   
Applied Materials maintains on-site  
solar generating capacity at our facilities 
in Singapore; Austin, TX; Bangalore,  
India; and Xi’an, China. Combined, these 
arrays generated 286 MWh of clean 
power in 2021.
 > Utility green procurement programs: 
Direct purchase of renewable energy 
from a utility provider.  >Virtual Power Purchase Agreements:  
Financial contracts with external solar, 
wind, and other renewable energy 
generating projects reduce our Scope 2 
emissions inventory by delivering clean 
power to the grid. Each Renewable Energy 
Certificate (REC) provided by project 
owners represents the environmental 
benefits of 1MWh of electricity generated 
from renewable sources. 
In 2021, Applied used over 245,000 MWh 
of green power from a combination of these 
sourcing strategies, representing 80% of 
our total U.S. and 57% of our total global 
electricity needs for the year. We continue 
to evaluate further renewable energy 
projects and in 2021 began partnering with 
sustainability consultant 3Degrees to define 
a roadmap for expanding our renewable 
electricity supply globally and reaching our 
2030 100% renewable electricity goal.

PROGRESSSustainability Report 202158Scope 3 Emissions
In early 2022, we completed our 2019  
Scope 3 emissions inventory baseline.
Among the 15 categories defined by the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Category 11, 
Use of Sold Products, represents by far 
our largest share of Scope 3 emissions. 
This category denotes the combined total 
emissions from all Applied semiconductor 
products sold during a reporting year 
(including emissions from both the 
technology’s energy draw in customer 
fabs and the chemicals and gases used in 
operational processes), estimated over the 
average lifetime of those products. Category 
1, Purchased Goods and Services, represents 
a large portion of Applied’s estimated supply 
chain emissions and is the second largest 
contributor to our Scope 3 footprint.
There is no semiconductor industry standard 
for measuring Category 11 emissions, 
but we have chosen to build on the SEMI 
S23 standard (related to energy, utilities, 
and material use efficiency) to model our 
tools’ energy consumption and estimate 
Category 11 emissions. For the purposes 
of our assessment, we include emissions 
not only from sold products but also from 
certain non-Applied ancillary and sub-fab 
equipment required for the tools’ operation, such as pumps, cooling systems, and point-
of-use abatement systems. Our calculation 
assumes an average 10-year product lifespan 
across all Applied tools and technologies. 
However, because customers and third 
parties frequently extend the life of Applied 
products through refurbishment (a plus for 
circularity and reuse, but a complication for 
GHG accounting), we will continue to review 
and refine our estimates and assumptions.
Semiconductor products represent the vast 
majority of Applied’s annual product sales. 
In next year’s report we will expand our 
Category 11 calculations to include our sale of 
Display products’ emissions.Calculating our 2019 Scope 3 baseline 
inventory was just the beginning. Applied 
will continue to review our Scope 3 
methodology each year to continuously 
refine the calculations, emissions factors, 
data, estimates and underlying assumptions 
aiming to replace Environmentally Extended 
Input–Output (EEIO) with primary data 
wherever possible, and we will report 
any resulting changes and implications. 
A complete overview of our Scope 3 
methodology can be found here .Though strategies adopted in pursuit of 
our 3x30 and SuCCESS30 goals are already 
driving reductions across our largest Scope 
3 categories, we are currently evaluating 
science-based targets (SBT s) across Scope 
1, 2, and 3 emissions to align our goals with 
the latest climate science. T o achieve the 
greatest impact in reducing emissions from 
the use of sold products, we will pursue 
collaboration across the semiconductor 
industry to (a) align on standards for 
measuring semiconductor product emissions 
and (b) collectively implement initiatives to 
drive down emissions in line with SBT s.

Our emissions reduction efforts are only one part  
of Applied Materials’ overall commitment to reducing 
our environmental impacts. 
Throughout our global operations, we 
also work continuously to reduce waste, 
conserve resources, promote safe and 
healthy work environments for our people 
and demonstrate environmental leadership 
in our communities. 
Our labs and manufacturing facilities 
account for the largest share of our global 
energy and water consumption. Throughout 
2021, new conservation, efficiency, and 
recycling/reuse programs at individual 
Applied facilities complemented our 
existing corporate-level initiatives. T o help reduce consumption within the 
semiconductor industry, we are working 
with our customers on our ambitious 3x30 
goals, which include boosting manufacturing 
efficiency and driving a 30% reduction in 
equivalent energy consumption for our 
semiconductor products.EHS Policies, Systems, 
and Governance
Applied Materials’ Environmental Health

company to protect the environment. The 
policy is signed by our President and CEO, 
distributed to all Applied locations globally, 
and referenced often during site team and 
management meetings.
Our EHS organization is an integrated 
entity with teams responsible for EHS in 
on-site operations (including construction, 
fire and life safety, and contractor safety), 
hazard and risk identification, customer 
site support operations, emergency 
preparedness, environmental management 
and product safety. These efforts are supported by company 
management and guided by our EHS policy. 
The Board’s Corporate Governance and 
Nominating Committee receives a report on 
EHS and sustainability matters each quarter 
and a more in-depth environmental and 
sustainability update annually.
We implement our EHS policy through 
our Environmental Health and Safety 
Management System (EHSMS), which 
conforms with international management 
system standards such as ISO 14001, 
ISO 45001, the U.S. Department of 
Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection 
Program (VPP), and EHS documentation to 
the requirements of ISO 9000.
See here  for more information on ISO 
certifications for our manufacturing sites.
“Applied is a company where everyone is equal to express themselves and there are many 
opportunities to expand your unique skills. In my role I enjoy working with my colleagues 
to understand the technology advances we are making and to help us all stay safe along 
the way, ultimately achieving an incident- and injury-free company culture.”

Applied Materials is committed to 
maximizing energy performance and 
minimizing consumption through:
 > Continuously monitoring energy use 
and conducting energy audits
 > Building optimal energy efficiency 
into all new facility construction, 
such as through LEED or Green Mark 
certification
 > Purchasing energy-efficient new 
equipment > Optimizing the temperature of chilled 
water used in our operations
 > Transitioning to 100% renewable

After several years of relatively flat energy 
usage, Applied’s energy use increased 
approximately 7% in 2021 over 2020 as both 
our operational footprint and demand for our 
products grew.
See the Climate and Energy  section of this 
report for more on Applied’s emissions and 
renewable power commitments.
Conservation, Efficiency, Renewables, 
and Reuse Projects, Worldwide
In 2021, energy and waste reduction efforts produced significant results at 
multiple Applied Materials sites around the world:
 > In Gloucester, MA, energy saving measures including air-flow, chiller, 
and boiler optimizations and LED lighting retrofits saved 1,379,213 kWh 
in 2021, while the site’s wind turbine delivered 5,801,148 kWh  
of energy.
 > Our facility in Xi’an, China, converted 180 light panels in newly 
reopened offices to LED, saving up to 41k kWh per year, and the 
facility’s installed solar capacity generated 39,836 kWh in  
clean electricity. 
 > In Taichung City, Taiwan, replacement of T5 fluorescent tubes with LED 
lighting produced a savings of 26,700 kWh in 2021. Reuse of wooden 
crate packaging is preventing half a ton of wood per month from going 
to landfill. Installation of a new pipeline and flow meter is reclaiming  
1 ton of cooling tower water daily for reuse in flush toilets.
 > Our Israel facilities made efficiency improvements to lighting, air 
handling units, chillers, and variable speed drives (for pumps). Two 
cafeterias replaced disposable cups and spoons with reusables, saving 
approximately 1.2 million cups per year.
 > At our Santa Clara, CA and Austin, TX facilities, our COVID protocols

PROGRESSSustainability Report 202163Waste Management
Applied is committed to minimizing waste 
across our locations and logistics operations, 
with a special focus on non-recyclable, 
landfill-bound waste.
Waste reduction, reuse, and recycling 
programs are managed at the site level and 
have been successful in minimizing waste 
generation (for example, by reducing printed 
documentation), increasing reuse and 
recycling of product and packaging materials, 
sorting recyclables at point of disposal, and 
maximizing composting of organic materials 
from our cafeteria operations. Waste 
management targets are set for individual 
manufacturing sites based on the ISO 14001 
framework and are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis and scored annually.
In 2021, we increased our diversion rate from 
landfill/incineration from 75% in 2020 to 
76% in 2021 and achieved a 12% reduction 
in hazardous waste generation. However, our 
non-hazardous waste generation increased 
by 50% due to increased activity at our 
manufacturing sites and better data reporting.See the Design for Sustainability  section for 
information on our responsible product and 
packaging initiatives.
Hazardous Waste Management: Hazardous 
waste accounted for 2% of our annual 
waste output in 2021. We contract with 
licensed third parties to transport waste 
(including hazardous waste) for off-site 
disposal, consistent with applicable laws and 
regulations. Our EHS organization provides 
oversight of third-party hazardous material 
disposal companies and verifies that all 
disposal sites and methods meet regulatory 
requirements. We also evaluate potential 
vendors via the CHWMEG Facility Review 
Program, which provides environmental, 
operational, and financial information on 
waste treatment, disposal, recycling, and 
storage facilities.
Wastewater Management: Applied strives to 
reduce the negative impacts of wastewater 
produced by our operations, monitoring 
to ensure sufficient removal of solids and 
adherence to permitted parameters (e.g., 
pH and fluoride content) before discharge 
to publicly owned treatment works. Each 
Applied facility is responsible for wastewater 
monitoring, with problems escalated to 
the site management team and applicable 
corporate staff for immediate correction.METRIC TONS

Water Management 
Although Applied’s operations are not high-
volume water consumers relative to our 
industry, we strive to optimize our water 
use. Our R&D labs account for our highest 
consumption of ultrapure water, followed by 
our manufacturing operations, routine use at 
our offices, and landscape irrigation  
around our properties. In manufacturing,  
only a few of our toolsets require significant 
water, with others relying on efficient 
closed-loop systems. In 2021, our total 
water withdrawal increased by 23.5% 
over 2020. The increase is a result of 
increased groundwater usage due to piping 
modifications and replacements in our Santa 
Clara facilities. However, we were able to 
decrease our use of irrigation water by 25%.Facilities groups are responsible for water 
use management at specific Applied sites, 
with oversight from the company’s EHS 
organization. Our Managing Director 
of EHS is responsible for ensuring that 
water-related risks and minimization 
opportunities are assessed as appropriate. 
Water reduction is covered under our EHS 
policy and ISO 14001 EHSMS, which call 
for our business operations to identify 
opportunities, make continual improvements 
on environmental preservation and natural 
resource conservation, and meet or exceed 
all relevant regulatory requirements.
Our water conservation efforts include:
 >Designing water-efficient products, 
following best practices for tool design 
and specifications for water use 
outlined in SEMI industry requirements
 >Water recycling and reuse for non-
potable applications, especially cooling 
and landscape irrigation
 >Rainwater collection for use in 
landscaping or non-production needs 
(at our Singapore Operations Center 
and Tainan Manufacturing Center 2)
 >Drought-tolerant landscaping and 
smart irrigation to reduce the number 
of watering days

Through our focus on improving the 
sustainability performance of new and 
existing tools, Applied Materials is helping 
semiconductor manufacturers realize 
substantial energy savings, meet their own 
sustainability goals and shrink the industry’s 
overall energy and chemical footprint.
Applied continues to partner with one of our 
key customers, TSMC, to create a system 
able to verify the efficacy of energy-saving 
improvements developed as part of the ISO 
50001 standard for energy management. 
Leveraging our iSystemTM controller, the new 
software conducts automated measurement 
of power usage from the operation of 
semiconductor fabrication tools, gauging 
actual energy use against a baseline.  This 
system is currently undergoing testing. Earlier 
TSMC energy-saving measures developed 
from iSystemTM data have resulted in annual 
electricity savings of 5.1 million kWh, GHG 
reductions of 9,700 MT CO2e, and cost 
benefits of US$2.4 million.
In 2021, we continued to reduce area per 
wafer pass on Metal Deposition products 
(>30%), ALD products (>25%), and Etch 
products (>15%).As we develop new tools, upgrade existing 
systems and create advanced service products, 
we proactively communicate their potential 
for cost reductions, yield improvements and 
sustainability benefits to our customers.
OLED Displays: Superior Viewing and Efficiency
T o take next-generation technologies mainstream, manufacturers need the tools to simplify fabrication, drive down production 
costs, and make consumer prices competitive. That’s what we offered them in the 2000s, when our equipment helped 
usher in the era of flat-panel LCD displays to replace older CRT s. Now Applied’s advanced manufacturing tool suites are

Circular Economy
Applied Materials works to promote the circular 
economy vision  by eliminating waste through design, 
creating efficiencies across the product lifecycle, and 
employing materials that can be reused or recycled at 
the end of a product’s functional life.
Remanufacturing Semiconductor 
Systems and Parts
Our systems are designed to last, to 
support upgrades and repurposing for new 
applications, and to be easily repairable if 
parts fail or performance falls belowacceptable standards. All newly 
manufactured parts are engineered 
for greater repairability, and we use 
refurbished parts whenever possible for 
repair and remanufacture, contributing to 
sustainability and cost-effectiveness.Expanding repairability:  By reviewing all 
parts for the potential to repair, we’ve grown 
the percentage of repaired parts we use to 
service tools under contract from 65% to 
more than 70% over the past three years. 
In a cross-functional effort, new parts are 
identified for potential repairability during 
new product introductions, and our service 
engineering group identifies used parts that 
can be confirmed for repair. We continue 
to look at parts that come into contact with 
process chemicals for potential repair or 
cleaning/reuse solutions.
Recovery and reuse:  Within AGS, a 
dedicated team specializes in recovering 
parts and assemblies from the market and 
reconditioning them for reuse, thereby 
reducing our manufacturing operation’s need 
for virgin materials. Each recovered part goes 
through an exacting process of inspection, 
decontamination, refurbishment, and repair, and is then recertified by AGS as “like 
new” for reuse and recirculation, with a full 
warranty and the same service level as a new 
part. On average, 40% of the parts used for 
servicing Applied Materials tools have been 
refurbished after previous use in an Applied 
system. We are constantly improving our 
refurbishment processes to grow that number 
by encompassing more part categories—for 
example, electrostatic chucks, whose reuse 
rate has increased 11% over the past three 
years. We maintain one of the industry’s 
largest global inventories of spare parts, with 
recovered parts searchable in our inventory 
management system and ready to be pulled 
for cleaning and reconditioning.
“Coming from a technology startup where you’re able to be extremely entrepreneurial in each 
of your initiatives, I thought I might face more limitations coming into a large, established 
corporation. Pleasantly, I found the opposite to be true. Applied has a culture of openness to 
different perspectives and new ways of tackling challenges.”

Food packaging extends shelf life and 
prevents food waste, which already  
accounts for as much as one eighth of  
global GHG emissions. Through these  
and other next-generation solutions,  
we are helping to build a circular economy  
that retains that embedded value while 
mitigating packaging’s effects on our land, 
seas, and resources.Building a Circular 
Economy for Flexible 
Packaging
Applied Materials is a member of CEFLEX, a 
collaborative initiative representing the full 
value chain of flexible packaging. CEFLEX stakeholders have endorsed a five-
step roadmap to building a circular economy 
for flexible packaging, together with needed 
actions in each part of the value chain to make 
it happen. In early 2022, CEFLEX proposed 
some revisions of its framework to align the 
industry in anticipation of global action on 
packaging waste. Now many activities are in 
the implementation phase.

products sold in South Korea are tested to 
ensure compliance with KC mark requirements 
(related to electromagnetic compatibility and 
electrical safety requirements).Any business unit or group that develops, 
sells, or distributes products is required 
to design and engineer those products 
to protect both the user’s personnel and 
facilities and the environment from exposure 
to risks, and that any residual risks remain 
below a minimum acceptable level when 
the products are operated, maintained, and

Responsibility 
In 2021, the global supply chain crisis, global 
semiconductor shortage, and ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic affected our supply chain operations  in ways 
large and small but did not prevent us from achieving 
progress on our supply chain goals. 
Throughout the year, we also saw a 
significant uptick in employee and team 
investment, enthusiasm, and shared 
responsibility around achieving the goals 
of our SuCCESS2030 initiative, a 10-year 
roadmap for extending our sustainability 
vision across the supply chain for our 
semiconductor and display businesses. 
Under SuCCESS2030, our assessments 
of supplier performance and capabilities 
require shared commitments in five main 
ESG focus areas, most of which include 
defined performance targets.  > Supplier Responsibility, Engagement, 
and Assessment:  Applied strives to be 
a partner to our suppliers, providing 
resources, guidelines, tools, and 
trainings to build capacity on advancing 
sustainable practices. We also support 
our suppliers and sub-tier suppliers 
in their efforts to conform to the 
Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) 
code of conduct. From this baseline, we 
can better gauge progress using RBA 
assessments and audits. > Inclusion and Supplier Diversity: 
Mirroring our own I&D journey, 
SuCCESS2030 promotes development 
of robust diversity strategies 
throughout our supply chain. Our 
near-term supplier diversity targets 
include increased representation of 
women and other underrepresented 
groups and increased percentage 
spend with women- and minority-
owned businesses, all by 2024. 
We are also working with our trade 
associations to significantly grow the 
pipeline of diverse talent available to 
the industry by 2030.
 > Packaging:  Our precision tools 
and products require carefully 
designed packaging to avoid damage 
during transport, and we are 
continuously exploring strategies to 
reduce packaging waste, including 
redesigning cases and crates for 
reuse, using recyclable material such 
as corrugated fiberboard for boxes, 
and doing testing and measurement 
to gauge the feasibility of reducing 
virgin materials usage.
 >Transportation and Logistics: To 
reduce emissions from airfreight, we 
are exploring the use of intermodal 
shipping options that can deliver 
product within a reasonable time frame. > Wastewater:  Though our own 
operations are neither water-intensive 
nor major emitters of wastewater, 
we recognize the need to reduce 
our industry’s large footprint in both 
areas. At suppliers with the requisite 
capabilities, we are exploring a process 
of pre-treating metal surfaces for rust 
protection using zinc oxide. The new 
process replaces phosphates, which 
can damage aquatic systems when 
released in wastewater.
SuCCESS2030 strengthens Applied’s ESG 
supply chain strategy, building on our 
foundation of supporting ethical labor 
practices, environmentally responsible 
operations, responsible minerals sourcing, 
and other programs promoting adherence 
to industry standards and international 
human rights standards. SuCCESS2030 is 
managed through our SuCCESS2030 Office, 
which oversees metrics and compliance 
audits and conducts training and 
coordination with participating suppliers. 
Across our operations, we conduct pilot 
programs to test new efficiency and waste-
reduction processes, with the intention 
of sharing key learnings with our supplier 
partners and magnifying positive impacts 
across the industry.INTRODUCTION

SuCCESS2030 encompasses a series of best 
practices for building a more sustainable 
business, society, and planet. As we raise 
the bar, we are also building our suppliers’ 
competencies to reach it.
Contract Obligations
For direct suppliers, our ESG requirements 
are incorporated into our Global Supplier 
Agreements and other supplier agreements 
via our “Supplier ESG Requirements” 
attachment. These requirements are also 
included in the terms and conditions for 
logistics suppliers and all purchase-order 
transactions and enumerated in our most 
commonly used agreements for indirect 
services. By contract as applicable, these 
require Applied’s suppliers to:
 >Implement Applied’s Standards of 
Business Conduct and the RBA Code 
of Conduct in their own operations and 
ensure RBA code compliance among 
their sub-tier suppliers >Comply with our Responsible Minerals 
Sourcing Policy and meet related 
statutory and regulatory requirements
 >Meet Applied’s other ESG requirements 
in their own operations and ensure 
compliance among their sub-tier 
suppliers
 >Comply with Applied’s Environmental 
Health and Safety Policy and “any 
applicable environmental, health or 
safety law, rule, regulation, order, 
decree or ordinance”
 >Comply with Applied’s minimum 
product EHS requirements
 >Provide requested information to 
enable Applied’s compliance with 
material content restriction regulations, 
including but not limited to REACH (EC 
number 1907/2006) and the U.S. Toxic 
Substances Control Act
 >Comply with the California 
Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 
2010, addressing the risk of slavery and 
human trafficking in supply chainsEngagement and Training
We want working with Applied to be a 
partnership, with collaboration driving benefit 
to all parties. In 2021, we began offering a 
structured program of webinars, trainings and 
assistance to help our suppliers close  
any gaps across our ESG focus areas. 
These included:
 >Weekly live webinars discussing key 
area of ESG focus
 >Online training on Applied Materials 
Supply Chain ESG Requirements >Training through the RBA e-Learning 
Academy and RBA workshops
 >Ability to contract for social 
responsibility and sustainability 
assistance from a consultant at pre-
negotiated rates
Our Applied commodity business managers 
are required to complete these trainings, 
assuring that the people who engage 
most frequently with our suppliers can 
knowledgeably communicate the business 
benefits of our sustainability expectations.

Responsibility Sustainability Report 202177 Sustainability Report 2021Supplier Assessments and Audit
Applied Materials employs a metrics-based 
approach to assessing supply chain ESG 
risks and reflects these assessments in our 
supplier scorecards. T o secure baseline 
data, we require subsets of our suppliers (as 
applicable) to:
 > Complete annual self-assessment 
questionnaires to measure their 
conformance to the RBA Code of 
Conduct (top 80% of direct suppliers 
by spend, and 10% of high-risk 
indirect suppliers)
 > Complete an RBA Environmental 
Survey to provide basic data on 
GHG emissions, energy use, water 
withdrawal, and waste generation, 
plus qualitative data on reduction 
targets and efforts (top 80% of direct 
suppliers by spend)
 > Submit conflict minerals reporting 
templates, as well as an extended 
minerals reporting template (ERMT) if 
applicable, as part of our responsible 
minerals sourcing due diligence
 > Report on their performance under 
environmental regulationsWe conduct detailed evaluations of reported 
information and assign suppliers risk 
scores using a weighted risk matrix that 
encompasses ESG and other risk indicators. 
We implement our SuCCESS2030 practices 
holistically, identifying gaps at every level, 
and provide suppliers the resources and tools 
they need to comply and thrive, rather than 
focusing corrective action solely on suppliers 
identified as posing high ESG risks.
For a second year, COVID-19 forced us to 
employ remote internal ESG audits for certain 
high-risk direct suppliers rather than going 
on-site. Consistent with RBA provisions, 
Applied required 33% of our high-risk 
suppliers to undergo an RBA external audit 
in 2021. This percentage is targeted to grow 
to 50% in 2022. We have contracted with 
an RBA-approved third-party audit firm to 
conduct such audits consistent with RBA 
audit standards.
Protecting Human Rights 
in Our Supply Chain
Applied Materials is unequivocally committed to protecting 
human rights and conducting business in an ethical and 
responsible manner around the world. We condemn and are 
committed to ending forced and bonded labor in all its forms, 
including child labor, indentured labor, slavery, and human 
trafficking.
Our commitment to protecting human rights wherever we do 
business is detailed in the policies and statements listed on 
page 51. We communicate our human rights commitments 
and requirements clearly to our supply chain and business 
partners to help ensure compliance with our expectations 
around humane treatment of the workforce and forbidding 
forced and bonded labor. We conduct due diligence on human 
rights risk in our supply chain and flag zero-tolerance issues in 
our supplier scorecards.

Minerals Sourcing
Applied Materials is committed to the 
responsible sourcing of minerals used in 
our products.
Key to this commitment is our policy around 
tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold, commonly 
referred to as 3TG or conflict minerals for 
their frequent origin in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining 
countries affected by conflict and human 
rights abuses. Since 2019, Applied Materials 
has retained Assent Compliance (“Assent”), 
a third-party service provider, to assist Applied in conducting outreach to suppliers 
regarding their use of 3TG in products 
furnished to Applied, and evaluating their 
responses and smelter engagements.
While our products include components 
manufactured with 3TG, we neither 
purchase these minerals directly nor 
maintain any direct relationship with mines, 
smelters or refiners that process these 
minerals. Our Responsible Minerals Sourcing 
Policy communicates our commitment to 
due diligence and disclosure and guides our  
direct suppliers’ sourcing of 3TG minerals.  
T o assure the efficacy of our policy, we  
utilize the Responsible Minerals Initiative 
(RMI) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process as well as independent third-party 
audits. In calendar 2021, we reviewed the 
list of suppliers we surveyed for calendar 
year 2020 and identified those who for 
three consecutive years had responded 
that the products they sold to Applied 
did not contain conflict minerals. Assent 
reached out to these suppliers on our behalf 
and requested that they provide Conflict 
Minerals Reporting T emplates. In addition, 
in an effort to reach suppliers with lower 
spend, we directly contacted almost all 
direct suppliers with a request for conflict 
minerals information. T ogether, these two 
groups of suppliers represent approximately 
92% of our total supplier spend in 2021. 
Approximately 97% of the suppliers 
surveyed by Assent responded. Due to 
the unprecedented business growth and 
changing roles and responsibilities among 
suppliers, nine surveyed suppliers were 
unable to provide T emplates.
Beyond 3TG, we also conduct due diligence 
on suppliers from whom we source products 
likely to contain cobalt, a frequently DRC-
sourced mineral that has been tied to child 
labor, unsafe working conditions and adverse 
environmental impacts. In 2020, Applied 
worked with Assent to request Cobalt 
Reporting T emplates (CRT) from suppliers 
expected to have cobalt in the products they furnish to Applied. Starting in 2021, Applied 
began requesting instead an Extended 
Minerals Reporting T emplate (“EMRT”), 
which covers cobalt and mica. The EMRT 
replaced the Cobalt Reporting T emplate and 
is expected to cover a growing list of minerals 
as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) 
and its partner organizations develop a 
broader responsible minerals sourcing 
program. In 2021, this effort garnered a 100% 
response rate. Looking ahead, we intend to 
expand due diligence to the copper, nickel, 
lead, zinc, and mica used in our products, 
consistent with RMI guidance.
In 2021, Applied Materials joined Copper Mark 
as one of its first partners, along with Ford 
Motor Company, Google, Intel and Wieland. 
Copper Mark aims to improve the responsible 
production practices of the copper industry, in 
part by developing and supporting criteria for 
responsible mineral production and sourcing. 
We participate in their three working groups, 
with a focus on the Due Diligence Working 
Group, which aims to support ethical copper 
sourcing practices.

Responsibility Sustainability Report 202179Packaging Reduction 
and Reuse
Our precision products require carefully 
designed packaging to avoid damage from 
shock and vibration during transport. In 2021, 
we launched a new Design for Distribution 
task force to encourage up-front planning 
and develop smarter packaging strategies 
that meet those demands while improving 
sustainability via materials reduction, 
improved recyclability, and reusability. 
In 2021, approximately 75% of our packaging 
materials were made from recyclable materials 
(polyethylene, polypropylene, corrugated 
fiberboard, steel, and wood), many of which 
are also reusable. We also enacted new 
supplier specifications that prohibit the use 
of certain packaging materials (including 
polystyrene) and require suppliers to report 
materials data, improving our ability to track 
our packaging’s recyclable content. Going forward, we are developing processes 
to track and enforce compliance with those 
specifications.
Ongoing initiatives are detailed below.
Lighter Polyethylene Bags  
T o save materials, we are moving from  
6 mil to 4 mil thickness for our low-density 
polyethylene (LDPE) bags. By year-end 
FY2022 we anticipate a >75% conversion  
rate globally for bags purchased directly for 
final goods.
“Just Strong Enough” Crates  
Where earlier wooden crate designs tended 
to be overbuilt for most use cases, our new, 
lighter crates are matched to the precise 
needs of individual products. In 2021, this 
strategy saved some 271,000 pounds of crate 
materials, and continuing efforts are on track 
to raise that figure to 1 million pounds by 
year-end FY2022.Hybrid Crate Design  
For lighter product shipments, we have begun 
using hybrid crates that pair a wooden base 
with a corrugated kraft board top and full 
moisture-barrier bagging inside. Offering a 
50% reduction in packaging weight, these 
designs save the equivalent of 3,917 trees 
annually, trim transport emissions and 
packaging material cost, ease recycling and 
increase safety for freight handlers. 
Reusable Packaging  
In 2021, we piloted a program that uses our 
Logistics T racking System to track packaging 
materials (wooden crates, metal fixtures), 
collect them post-install from customer sites, 
and return them to the manufacturing location 
for reuse. Beginning with a domestic loop from 
Singapore, we tested international loops in 
Q3 2021. We are also exploring a reusability 
process for our 500-pound pallets and for 
crates from our contract manufacturers.Reusable Packaging Labels  
Labels communicate to the end user that our  
packaging is reusable and must not be discarded.
Waste Reduction  
T o keep our packaging out of landfills, 
Applied prohibits the use of non-recyclable 
materials such as Styrofoam. We also plan 
to restrict the use of non-recyclable and 
environmentally burdening materials such as 
PVC and toxic foams in the upcoming revision 
of Applied’s Supplier Packaging Specification 
due for release in FY22.
Packaging ESG Dashboard  
An in-progress initiative is using existing 
SMS and SAP systems to develop 
measurement dashboards detailing our 
packaging’s ESG impact. 
Flexible Solutions for Our 
Packaging Ecosystem
Having real-world impact on packaging waste requires real-world insight—into 
how much protection individual products need, where we are shipping them, and 
what the capacities are for recycling and reuse in those locations. Then, we design 
the most resource-efficient packaging and processes to match.
At our TMC factory in T aiwan, we are eliminating some 
packing crates altogether by trucking products directly 
to our local customers.INTRODUCTION

T o broaden the impact of our inclusion and 
diversity commitment, Applied Materials 
works to build diversity in our supply chain, 
both through onboarding women- and 
minority-owned suppliers and through 
encouraging equitable hiring practices across 
our supply base. 
Our supplier diversity program is one of the 
main pillars of our SuCCESS2030 initiative, 
and in 2021 we met our goal of increasing our 
diverse spend by at least 2% year on year, 
through both existing and newly onboarded 
diverse suppliers. For 2022, our goal is for 
2.5% of our total global spend to reside with 
certified diverse suppliers. In addition, we are 
partnering with applicable existing suppliers 
to pursue their diversity certifications through 
the Women’s Business Enterprise National 
Council (WBENC) and National Minority 
Supplier Diversity Council (NMSDC).Beyond expanding our diverse supplier base, 
we are also working to integrate equity and 
inclusion across our procurement operations, 
adding resiliency to our supply chain. In 
June 2021, we hired a dedicated supplier 
diversity program manager and began hosting 
webinars to help our suppliers boost their 
own supplier diversity efforts. T o measure 
our progress in alignment with other supplier 
diversity programs, we employ the RGMA 
Five Levels of Supplier Diversity framework. 
Near-term objectives include:
 > Launching trainings for senior 
executives, procurement professionals, 
and commodity business managers
 > Evaluating opportunities to increase 
diverse spend within our Tier 1 and Tier 
2 supplier base
Over the long term, we strive to build a 
true partnership with our suppliers to drive 
diversity throughout our supply chain and set 
a positive example for our industry, all while 
better meeting our business needs. 
Defining Diversity 
Applied Materials’ diverse suppliers must be certified by 
a third-party auditor as being at least 51% diverse owned, 
controlled, and operated by U.S. minorities (African-
American/Black, Hispanic/Latin-American, Native American, 
Asian-Pacific American, Asian-Indian American), women, 
minority women, LGBTQ, persons with disabilities, veterans, 
or service-disabled veterans. Applied Materials also tracks 
additional diverse suppliers who could potentially be 
registered as diverse if they proceed with certification.
As a founding member of SEMI’s Manufacturing Ownership 
Diversity (MOD) working group, Applied Materials is 
working to provide best practices for supplier diversity in the 
semiconductor industry.

TransPak: Shared 
Commitment to ESG
Founded in Silicon Valley in 1952, T ransPak 
witnessed the birth of the tech epicenter 
while serving the packaging needs of the 
world’s top tech brands. A certified woman-
owned business, T ransPak began working 
with Applied Materials in 1978, forging a 
relationship that T ransPak Board Chair Arlene 
Inch describes as “changing the trajectory”  
of her family’s company.
“Having to meet Applied’s standards kept  
us on our toes and pushed us to be better,” 
said Inch. “Over time, we developed a partnership that led to our international 
expansion along the lines of Applied’s 
needs. Without the strength of that 
relationship, we would never have had 
the courage to strike out and establish 
ourselves in so many other countries, which 
led to even more strength and diversity, and 
additional global customers.”
The two companies share common core 
values and a strong commitment to 
advancing ESG.
“Our shared philosophy, environmental 
consciousness, social initiatives of diversity and 
inclusion, and our governance model support 
the leaders of our organizations to create a 
mutually beneficial relationship,” said Inch. T ransPak aims to be carbon neutral by 
2025, and in support of that goal now 
uses electric forklifts and solar power 
at their manufacturing plants. Inch says 
T ransPak has always tried to use as many 
sustainable and recyclable materials as 
it could in its packaging, because “it just 
seemed like the right thing to do.” 
“I hate waste and inefficiency, so being 
careful about materials and waste came 
naturally,” she said. 
With a strong commitment to diversity, 
equity, and inclusion, T ransPak 
is committed to diverse hiring, 
participating in community events, 
and supporting local community 
organizations. “People spend most of 
their waking hours at their workplace 
and it should reflect their culture and 
values. It’s just good business to respect 
local customs, provide opportunities for 
people from all backgrounds, and allow 
everyone in the organization to learn 
from each other,” said Inch.

Respective 
responsibilities  Applied Materials is responsible for preparing the Report and for the collection and 
presentation of the information within it.  
ERM CVS’ responsibility is to provide conclusions on the agreed scope based on the 
assurance activities performed and exercisin g our professional judgement.  
Our conclusions  
Based on our activities , as described below,  nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the 2021  data 
and information for the disclosures listed under ‘Scope’ above are not fairly presented, in all material respects, 
with the reporting criteria . 
 
Our assurance activities    
A multi -disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed a range of assurance procedures 
which varied across the disclosures covered by our assurance engagement , as follows:    
 A review of internal reporting guidelines  and procedures , including unit conversion s, estimations , 
emission factors  and assumptions used;  
 A walk -through of the reporting and data management systems used for each indicator group 
(Workforce, Environmental, Health & Safety and Community Impact data programs);  
 Interviews with data owners at corporate level (e.g. environmental, social, health & safety and 
community impact)  to understand the data consolidation process and internal controls ; 
 An analytical review of fiscal year 2021 full year data by conducting a year -over-year analysis per site 
for the selected indicators which included testing the completeness and accuracy of data ; 
 Virtual site visits to four si tes (Alzenau in Germany, Xian Campus in China, and Bowers Campus and 
Harris Branch Campus in the USA)  to understand local reporting processes, data management and 
reporting;  
 Desktop review of underlying source data for site visits , Scope 3  and renewable energy  calculations;  
 A review of alignment of indicators with the established reporting criteria;  
 An evaluation of the consistency of definitions used to classify data for the health & safety and 
workforce -related indicators;  
 Testing of a sample of underlying data on transactions, cases and profiles for the community impact, 
health & safety and workforce indicators respectively;  
 An in -person  head office visit to review outcomes of Applied Ma terials internal QA/QC process,  
including changes made to fiscal year 2021  data following the findings from the site visits and other 
assurance testing carried out , and to have in -depth discussions around 2019 Scope 3 GHG emissions 
calculations methodologies used and Corporate -level source d ata for the categories included ; and  
 Reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the Report to ensure 
consistency with our findings.  
 
The limitations of our engagement  
The reliability of the assured performance data is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods 
for determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information. It is important to understand our assurance 
conclusion in this context.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any third party 
using or placing reliance on our opinion in order to make a decisions related to Applied Materials.  
 
Force -majeure  
Prior to our assurance engagement, travel restrictio ns were imposed following the outbreak of COVID -19. As a 
result of these, we agreed to replace in person site visits with ‘virtual’ visits via conference and video calls for 
this year’s assurance engagement. While we believe these changes do not affect our  limited assurance 
conclusion above, we draw attention to the possibility that if we had undertaken in person visits, we may have 
identified errors and omissions in the assured information that we did not discover through the alternative 
assurance program.   
 
 
 Our independence  
ERM CVS is a member of the ERM Group. The work that ERM CVS conducts for clients is solely related to 
independent assurance activities and auditor training. Our processes are designed and implemented to ensure 
that the work we undertake with clients is fre e from bias and conflict of interest. ERM CVS and the staff that 
have undertaken work on this assurance exercise provide no consultancy related services to Applied Materials  
in any respect.  
 
Our Observations  
We have provided Applied Materials with a separate management report with our detailed (non -material) 
findings and recommendations.
