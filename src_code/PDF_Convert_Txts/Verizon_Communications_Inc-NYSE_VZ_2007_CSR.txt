Our habitat restoration project 
at the Verizon Center campus 
in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, 
earned us the Governor’s 
Environmental Excellence Award 
for Healthy Ecosystems in 2007. The on-going environmental project is a collaborative effort among 
Verizon, the New Jersey Audubon Society and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service that’s improving 25 acres of grass and wetland 
habitat. Our Basking Ridge campus sits in a watershed adjacent to a 
portion of the 7,000-acre Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge.
The goal of the project, which started early in 2007, was to return 
the parcel to its native state.  Together with our partners, we’ve 
planted 550 native trees and shrubs at the location. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also recognized Verizon 
in 2007 by naming us to their WasteWise Hall of Fame. The true 
game-changer for creating cleaner, greener communities and 
addressing energy challenges, however, may well be broadband 
technology. To learn more about Verizon’s environmental 
stewardship and the green benefits of broadband, see page 32. Doing the Work  2007 Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report   | 1 Contents

the Consumer Electronics 
Association in Washington, 
DC after receiving the 
organization's Digital Patriot 
Award for his commitment to 
the effective advancement of 
technology, innovation and 
U.S. competitiveness.I am pleased to share Verizon’s 2007 
Corporate Responsibility Report, “Doing 
the Work. ” In these pages, we highlight 
our accomplishments and challenges 
in the areas that define our approach 
to corporate responsibility, as well as 
provide an in-depth look at a few of 
our signature programs. We hope this 
gives you a feel for the human impact of 
these initiatives and, together with our 
previous three reports, demonstrates 
a consistent record of achievement in 
corporate responsibility.
The actions you’ll read about in this 
report reflect the commitment of our 
employees to improving the quality 
of life in our communities. They also 
reflect a deeply ingrained culture of 
corporate responsibility that embeds a 
consciousness of the social impact of our 
business into all of our decisions. 
At Verizon, we manage corporate 
responsibility the way we do anything 
we truly care about as a business: with 
disciplined goals, a focus on results, a 
commitment to operating excellence and 
a grounding in our corporation’s core 
values and beliefs. Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report   | 3Making Corporate Responsibility Work
Corporate responsibility starts with a 
belief that what you do is important 
to society. This belief is at the heart 
of our company. Over the course of 
its more than 125-year history, the 
communications industry has played a 
unique and positive role in driving our 
economy and creating the bonds that 
connect our customers to people, ideas 
and opportunities. 
Our people believe passionately that 
what we do—what they do—makes  
a difference for customers and our 
society as a whole. 
This social dimension is built into our 
very mission as a network company, in 
the fullest sense of the term. You see it 
reflected in our business purpose and 
values, which inform and animate our 
interactions with millions of customers, 
partners and stakeholders. (See “The 
Verizon Commitment and Values” on 
page 6.) To reinforce this value-driven 
culture among our 235,000 employees, 
we have a disciplined compliance 
process involving extensive training in 
the Verizon Code of Conduct, and we are 
extending this process throughout our 
increasingly global supply chain.
The six corporate responsibility priorities 
you will read about in this report 
represent our view of where our actions 
will have the greatest impact on society. 
In managing a company the size of 
Verizon—which touches hundreds of 
issues, thousands of communities and 
millions of customers every day—we Our people believe passionately that 
what we do makes a difference for 
customers and our society as a whole. are always conscious of the concept of 
“materiality”; that is, how can we use 
our enormous technical, financial and 
intellectual resources to accomplish 
something equally significant? 
In 2007, we addressed these priorities 
with distinctive programs that used 
our unique resources to achieve visible 
results in the following categories:
•	 Ethics	and	governance
•	 Service	and	innovation
•	 Empowering	employees
•	 Promoting	community	growth
•	 Protecting	the	environment,	and
•	 Partnering	with	communities.
We have a disciplined process for 
managing corporate responsibility. In 
2007, we reorganized our Corporate 
Responsibility Council to better align 
with the core competencies of our 
business. It is chaired by two senior 
officers—Tom Tauke, executive vice 
president – Public Affairs, Policy 
and Communications and Dan 
Mead, president of Verizon Services 
Operations—and includes leaders 
from all operating units as well as our 4 | Doing the Work 2007Foundation and corporate responsibility 
staffs. Under their leadership, the council 
establishes benchmarks and goals, 
assigns and enforces accountability and 
measures and tracks results. 
This results-oriented process keeps us 
focused on “materiality. ” 
In 2007, we made big strides in areas of 
critical importance to our business, from 
risk assessment to global supply-chain 
management to strategic philanthropy, 
and we are constantly honing our ability 
to use the intelligence we gain from 
these initiatives to make ourselves a 
smarter, better business. 
You will see this focus on performance 
reflected in a new section of this report, 
which lays out what we said, what we 
did and what we will do next in each of 
our six priority areas. (See pages 8-1 1.)
The biggest compliment that a CEO 
can pay to the corporate responsibility 
function is to demand that it produce 
results—and at Verizon, it does. 
The Big Picture
Effective management—of corporate 
responsibility or anything else—is 
about consistency, accountability, 
discipline and details. That commitment 
to operational excellence has helped 
us accomplish some big, ambitious 
goals: building the nation’s best wireless 
network, investing in a world-class fiber-
optic network to our customers’ homes, 
strengthening the global Internet and pushing the envelope on innovation. 
We have only scratched the surface in 
discovering all the ways that these fantastic 
high-speed digital networks—and the 
new generation of products, services and 
applications they make possible—can be 
part of the solution to the most pressing 
issues of our time. 
Our goal is to make these empowering 
technologies as widely available as 
possible and to use our leadership and 
resources to create new solutions to big 
problems. For example, you’ll see in this 
report that we’re exploring how greater 
use of broadband can reduce energy 
consumption and create a greener, 
cleaner world. Through my role as chair 
of the Health and Retirement Committee 
of the Business Roundtable, Verizon is 
involved in advocating for an interoperable 
system of electronic health-care records 
that can drive down costs and reduce 
medical errors for millions of Americans. 
Our award-winning online educational 
resource, Thinkfinity.org, makes the best 
work of a Dean’s List of cultural, scientific 
and educational institutions available to 
teachers, parents and students, free of 
charge. Furthermore, our longstanding 
partnerships with literacy experts are 
producing measurable improvements in 
outcomes. Also, we are moving forward, 
both on our own and with partners and 
suppliers, with the next generation of 
innovative products and services that 
will extend the benefits of technology to 
people who—for reasons of geography, 
economic status, age or physical 
limitation—have been slower to benefit 
from the broadband revolution.We have applied ourselves in a 
serious way to matters that make 
a difference to our customers, 
take advantage of our resources 
and have measurable outcomes. Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report   | 5We are also committed to building a 
company that can compete and succeed 
in our rapidly evolving industry.  
With the help of our training and tuition 
assistance programs, our employees 
are expanding their skills so they 
can continue to design, build and 
operate the most advanced networks 
being deployed in the world today, as 
well as market increasingly complex 
products and services. We recognize the 
competitive advantage that comes from 
having employees with diverse ethnic 
backgrounds, life experiences and points 
of view who can relate to customers 
and reflect the diversity of our markets. 
We offer a wide variety of flexible work 
policies to assist employees in juggling 
the demands of work and family. 
Above all, we provide challenging work 
in an exciting industry, which makes 
Verizon a great place to build a career.
As fervently as we believe in the benefits 
of technology, we also are well aware of 
the law of unintended consequences. 
Every scientific and technological 
advance in our history has brought 
with it unforeseen risks that need to be 
managed, and that is certainly true of 
digital communications. 
As customers live more and more of their 
lives online, we face growing concerns 
over the privacy and security of personal 
information. As children create social 
networks and virtual worlds that are 
often beyond the reach—not to mention 
the comprehension—of many adults, 
parents need better ways of protecting 
their child’s online safety. As digitization 
turns music, art, television and movies 
into an endless series of 1’s and 0’s, 
we need 21st century approaches to 
protecting intellectual property rights. 
And as the 24x7 demands of the Internet 
Age threaten to overwhelm customers 
with complexity, they need trusted and 
reliable companies to help them make 
sense of technology and put it to use to 
make their lives better. So for all our accomplishments, 
these emerging issues remind us 
that we always have more to do 
and more to learn. Our corporate 
responsibility process is helping us do 
that—functioning as an early warning 
system, helping us view ourselves 
from the outside in, and making us a 
learning organization that can adapt 
to the threats and opportunities 
that, in an interconnected world, 
arise with astonishing speed. 
The discipline of corporate responsibility 
is based on a big idea: that a healthy 
society and healthy companies are 
mutually dependent. At Verizon, we’re 
taking that big idea and turning it into 
action, every day. We have applied 
ourselves in a serious way to matters 
that make a difference to our customers, 
take best advantage of our resources and 
have measurable outcomes. 
Verizon is fortunate. We have a strong 
culture and great employees, and we 
work in an industry with boundless 
possibilities for growth and innovation. 
But at the end of the day, you have to do 
the work. While there are always more 
challenges in our path, I’m proud to say 
that—with the help of our employees, 
our partners and our stakeholders—
Verizon is doing some pretty terrific work 
to improve people’s lives, create a great 
place to work and make a difference for 
our customers.

Verizon Telecom   Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report   | 7Strong values and good intentions are necessary  
but not sufficient for an effective approach to 
corporate responsibility.
Effectiveness requires discipline and consistency, so 
we set clear objectives, report our progress and hold 
ourselves accountable for the results. Just as we do in 
every aspect of our business.
 As we say at Verizon, we have to do the work —  
and produce results.

12 | Doing the Work 2007 Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report  | 13We’re just beginning to discover all the ways  
that high-speed digital networks can help solve  
the pressing issues of our time.
Our goal is to make these technologies as widely 
available as possible and to use our leadership  
and resources to address the issues that are critical  
to the success of our business and the well-being  
of our communities. 
In the following pages are a few stories that show 
our progress. You’ll see that making our products and 
services accessible for customers with disabilities or 
special needs has enormous benefits. The greater use  
of broadband in Fort Wayne, Indiana is proving to be  
a strong platform for economic growth.  
And our commitment to education, Thinkfinity.org,  
is providing high-caliber educational content  
in a way that can improve learning—anytime,  
anywhere, for free. Earning our reputation
Olivia Gomez
Sr. Customer Service Representative  
Verizon WirelessDavid Shelton speaks to us with his 
hands, and we’re responding face-
to-face in the language he knows best.
We’re doing it via videophones with 
employees who know American Sign 
Language so that deaf or hearing-
impaired customers like Shelton can 
communicate with us in the way they’re 
most comfortable. The service began in 
2007 and it is making a difference.
 “It’s wonderful because there are  
no third-party interpreters, ” said  
Shelton, a retired federal employee  
living in Maryland. 
“You get to speak face-to-face with 
customer service, and that really makes 
a huge difference because I can make 
better decisions. I’ve called several times 
and my issues have been taken care of 
without any problem—not just because 
I get to speak directly with someone at 
Verizon, but also because that person 
understands what I’m talking about. ” 
Shelton’s conversations with Verizon are 
made possible through our network and 
the availability of the high-speed Internet 
access we provide to our customers.We’re committed to making that 
technology accessible to everyone, and 
we’ve been working toward that goal 
for 15 years through our two Verizon 
Centers for Customers with Disabilities 
in Marlboro, Massachusetts and Oxnard, 
California. The centers, which handled 
nearly 800,000 calls last year and created 
more than $55 million in sales, provide 
telecommunications services for people 
with hearing, vision, mobility, speech and 
cognitive limitations.
“People forget sometimes that those 
who are deaf or hearing impaired relish 
the experience of a videophone because 
their first language is a visual one, not 
a written or spoken one, ” said Linda 
Mahoney, a manager at the Marlboro 
center. “To them, written English is the 
equivalent of a second language. ”
Aging and Technology
The need to make technology  
accessible is growing. 
People with disabilities are the largest 
minority in America. At more than 
55 million, they represent a sizable

Sign Language to assist David Shelton, a 
deaf Verizon FiOS customer in Maryland.population of potential customers 
and employees. Their number will 
rise dramatically with the baby-boom 
generation now reaching retirement 
age. According to projections, in just two 
years there will be 34 million people in 
the U.S. between the ages of 65 and 84. In 
10 years, the number rises to 47 million.
Along with disability, age is becoming a 
factor in the adoption and accessibility of 
technology—the most telling example 
is in the use of cell phones. Among some 
age segments—those between the ages 
of 20 and 40, for instance—almost 90 
percent have cell phones. But among 
seniors (those older than 65), only about 
50 percent have them today, according 
to research done by the Pew Trust. While 
today’s seniors are more familiar with 
technology, they are facing challenges in 
the use of it such as the onset of hearing 
problems, weaker eyesight and arthritis 
among other things.
Verizon took two significant actions in 
2007 to help aging adults address some 
of these challenges. 
In March 2007, the Verizon Foundation 
delivered a $1.5 million grant to the 
American Foundation for the Blind to 
fund and expand the organization’s Web 
site. The site (www.afb.org/seniorsite) 
is geared to help aging adults with low 
vision lead independent and comfortable 
lives. Among the materials on the site are: 
The easy to use Coupe phone 
from Verizon Wireless earned a 
Good Housekeeping Seal in 2007. 
Launched in September 2007, the 
phone quickly exceeded all sales 
estimates, pointing to a pent-up 
demand for such products.•	A	nationwide	database	of	services	for	
seniors with low vision, which shows 
them where to find large print or audio 
books, where to receive computer 
training and provides comprehensive 
listings of counseling centers. 
•	A	library	of	video	material	providing	
demonstrations on everything from 
meal preparation and instruction 
on using adaptive devices to video 
testimonials from other aging adults. 
Later in the year, we launched a mobile 
phone dubbed the “Coupe. ” The Coupe 
is lightweight with a large display and 
has buttons with larger numbers. It also 
features a dedicated key for calls to 911, 
as well as programmable “In Case of 
Emergency” numbers. 
It also offers an easy-to-use voice-dialing 
feature and color-coded keys for specific 
features—a white key for volume control, 
red for the battery-charging port and 
blue for the headset port.
The Coupe earned a Good Housekeeping 
Seal in 2007 for its ease of use. Launched 
in September 2007, the phone quickly 
exceeded all sales estimates, pointing to 
a pent-up demand for such products.Along with the Coupe, Verizon designed 
a cell-phone service plan for older 
Americans called “America's Choice 65 
Plus. ” It’s inexpensive—$20 a month with 
a two-year service plan—and simple, 
with lots of “anytime” minutes and even 
more night and weekend minutes. 
Broadband Makes It Possible
Innovations such as the Coupe phone are 
in keeping with our tradition of providing 
accessible technology—and being 
among the first to do so.
The Verizon Center for Customers with 
Disabilities in Marlboro opened in 
October 1992 and initially only served 
Massachusetts. Today, it serves Delaware, 
the District of Columbia, Maryland, New 
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode 
Island, Virginia and West Virginia. With 
the opening of the center in Oxnard four 
years ago, Verizon is now able to address 
the communications needs of disabled 
customers in 25 states.
16 | Doing the Work 2007
The use of videophones started in the 
Marlboro center. The option has proved 
so popular—growing primarily by 
customer referral—that the center now 
has plans to have four videophones 
installed in 2008 and to add the feature 
to the center in Oxnard. Videophone 
customer service is available currently 
to customers in the District of Columbia, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, 
Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. “We’re always trying to find ways to 
service our customers in an accessible 
manner, ” Mahoney said. “We serve them 
with e-mail. We have products with 
Braille, phones with big buttons, phones 
that have photos on the buttons to help 
people who have cognitive difficulties, 
and we even have phones that operate 
by remote control for people with 
physical disabilities. ”David Shelton, who isn’t shy in 
expressing his appreciation for how 
the center and its employees help 
him, said it was difficult to express 
how much the use of the videophone 
service has meant to him.
“I tell everyone about it and how great 
it is, ” he said. “If Verizon were to remove 
that service, there would be such a 
feeling of loss for deaf people like me. ”

To make our technology accessible to the growing 
community of people with physical and cognitive 
limitations, we embraced a set of Universal 
Design Principles*  nearly 20 years ago. The 
principles (see right) are now an integral part of  
the product design process throughout Verizon. 
Verizon was the first telecommunications  
company to adopt the principles and to 
have an active Universal Design Committee, 
which examines company products and 
services to determine how they can assist 
customers who have functional limitations.The outstanding quality of 
the video connection that's

technology in Fort Wayne fuels demand 
for Internet and computer training. 
Here, local high school students help 
seniors navigate the Internet in an 
intergenerational program conducted 
by the Fort Wayne Urban League. Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report  | 19Innovation comes to life 
in broadband-powered 
Fort Wayne
Ultra-high bandwidth is creating economic 
growth and driving new solutions in health 
care, transportation and public safety.
Verizon is delivering content 
to customers in ways that few 
companies can match. 
We’ve built a national wireless data 
network, a global Internet Protocol 
(IP) backbone and a best-in-class fiber 
network that is delivering ultra-high 
bandwidth all the way to customers’ 
homes. Not only do these networks 
enable us to deliver today’s multimedia 
services faster and more reliably,  
they also provide a platform for 
innovation and economic growth  
and next-generation services. 
Nowhere is that more evident than  
in Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
From 2000 to 2004, employment in the 
Fort Wayne area fell 21 percent in the 
industrial sector—a steeper loss than 
the 15 percent decline experienced 
statewide. Facing a city in transition, 
officials believed Fort Wayne could 
become a center for innovation and 
global businesses.The city’s then mayor, Graham Richard, 
was convinced that a key ingredient 
to Fort Wayne’s future would be found 
in the high-speed communications 
technologies being developed by 
Verizon. Richard believed that as a 
technology leader, Fort Wayne could 
be more competitive in attracting new 
businesses in the global economy.
That conviction led Fort Wayne to 
become one of the first cities in 
the Midwest to have fiber-optic 
broadband services—FiOS—installed 
throughout the city. To make the 
most of it, the city has become a 
hotbed of innovative applications.
“We are making strides to be wired and 
inspired, ” Richard said.
A Sound Investment
Verizon invested nearly $70 million 
to deploy some 9 million feet of fiber 
throughout Fort Wayne and also in 
nearby New Haven. That investment 
has brought the fastest broadband 
data services in the country to 130,000 
households and small businesses.City leaders created “Innovation Teams” 
to promote innovation and investment. 
These iTeams are charged with finding 
new ways to enhance the city’s services 
via broadband. For example:
A NetLiteracy Team  is building public 
computer labs, teaching computer and 
Internet skills to senior citizens, especially 
those who are mobility impaired or lack 
reliable transportation. 
Jan Zimmerman, a NetLiteracy trainer, 
said the real beauty of the program is 
that “seniors who have learned these 
basic computer skills can bridge the 
educational divide by mentoring 
students online who are part of the 
state’s 21st Century Scholars Program. ” 
(Students in the 7th or 8th grade who 
meet income eligibility requirements can 
receive up to four years of college tuition 
to attend a participating Indiana public 
or private college or university.)
An iTeam for the deaf and hearing-
impaired community  has been 
established to help those individuals 
achieve greater independence by 
developing a video relay service on a 
broadband network. 
Marsha Kunash, an iTeam member and 
director of DeafLink, which provides 
interpreting services, said that the new 
broadband equipment greatly improves 
the upload time. “The new broadband 
service provides clearer images of the 
person signing and gets closer to real-
time signing, ” she said.
A virtual medical iTeam  is providing 
real-time diagnosis for diabetic patients 
with possible retinal problems. By 
putting a special camera in clinics, 
patients can be diagnosed by a specialist 
from a remote location, usually their 
office or home. The specialist has the 
ability to sign on and review camera 
images of the patient’s retina in high-
resolution video, either in real time or 
later. According to Richard, the real-time 
application has contributed to saving the 
sight of five patients.
Other iTeams in the works will focus 
on improving services in health-care 
information systems, transportation, 
public safety, online learning, and 
advanced manufacturing and library 
services. For example, work is under 
way to utilize Fort Wayne’s broadband 
network to allow remote fire inspections

improving public safety.of homes, and to implement an 
e-mentoring program, in which college 
students could serve as mentors to 
under-served urban students. 
The city also established an initiative 
to support new business development 
and job creation. That effort paid off 
when Raytheon, a technology company 
specializing in defense and aerospace 
systems, announced that it was adding 
more jobs to its Fort Wayne facility. 
The Raytheon site manager told the 
local newspaper, “We’re updating our 
bandwidth to match the capability that 
Broadband and the Economy
Raytheon’s decision to add more jobs in Fort Wayne reflects a  
point made in recent studies about the economic impact of 
investing in broadband networks.
A 2008 study by Connected Nation, a nonprofit group focused  
on improving broadband adoption across the country, noted that  
a modest increase in the adoption of broadband in the United 
States would have an annual economic impact of $134 billion.
The study found that a 7 percent increase in broadband adoption 
would create 2.4 million jobs across the United States, would  
save $662 million in health-care costs and $6.4 billion in vehicle 
mileage, among other savings.
In addition to the health-care and mileage savings, U.S. residents 
would save 3.8 billion hours a year by conducting transactions 
online—at a cost-savings of $35.2 billion—and the country would 
gain $92 billion in new wages from the 2.4 million jobs created 
through broadband growth.
Another study by the MIT Communications Futures Program found 
that communities with mass-market broadband experienced rapid 
growth in jobs, an increase in the number of businesses involved in 
the information-technology sector and a rise in property values in 
areas with broadband availability.
was done with Verizon. That bandwidth 
infrastructure was an enabling element 
for us to put this investment here. ”
By becoming a broadband community, 
Fort Wayne now has a 4 percent annual 
economic growth rate—outpacing the 
rest of the state. In short, what is still a 
vision for many other communities is a 
reality in Fort Wayne.
 Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report  | 21Darwin Dahlgren, CEO of Lambdatech 
International and ZOOM Information 
Systems, relocated his two high-
technology, bandwidth-hungry 
companies from Minnesota's Twin Cities 
to the Northern Indiana Innovation 
Center in Fort Wayne due in part to the 
wide availability of Verizon's fiber-optic 
broadband, and the technical work 
force it attracts. It is a combination that 
makes Fort Wayne an ideal incubator for 
broadband start-ups.22 | Doing the Work 2007Math teacher Christy Wrede was 
looking for solutions. 
Like many of her colleagues across the 
country, she fits workshops and seminars 
into an already impossibly busy schedule 
to find ways of incorporating new 
technology into her classroom. Searching 
the Internet, however, is just not a viable 
means for helping the 6th and 8th grade 
special education students she teaches 
at Carteret Middle School outside of 
Newark, New Jersey.
“You get a million results and half of 
them aren’t usable” , she said. 
At a workshop she attended in 2007, 
Wrede discovered Thinkfinity.org—the 
Verizon Foundation’s free Web site of 
education resources and professional 
development. This Web site was different 
from anything she had seen before. Created by leading experts in  
education, Thinkfinity.org offers  
Wrede “quality material that you  
can use in the classroom. ” 
After using it for two months, she’s  
found new applications for her lessons 
and, best of all, discovered “how to apply 
new math applications in real life that I 
never even thought of. ” 
Wrede was also delighted to find that 
the content on Thinkfinity.org—which 
is provided by 11 premier education 
organizations in the United States (see 
list of content partners page 24)—meets 
national and state standards.
Gene Wilhoit, executive director of The 
Council of Chief State School Officers, 
called Thinkfinity.org a positive resource 
and a “wonderful example of not just 
throwing something out there because 
it’s high-tech. ”

“ With the material on Thinkfinity.org, 
the students pay attention a lot better 
because they see the lesson in an 
interactive way. ”
     Christy Wrede 
       Teacher at Carteret Middle School, Carteret, New Jersey24 | Doing the Work 2007“There was a lot of serious thought 
behind Thinkfinity, and I have a deep 
admiration for Verizon taking this on, ” 
Wilhoit said. “Just imagine this—a 
corporation willing to invest millions, 
engage professionals and not cut 
corners. That’s the kind of true corporate 
citizenship we’ve been looking for. ”
Hailed as the Best
Wrede is among more than 250,000 
teachers from all 50 states and the 
District of Columbia who have been 
trained to use this award-winning, 
nationally recognized Web site since 
1997. It offers more than 55,000 free 
standards-based resources to anyone 
with an Internet connection. These 
resources include K-12 lesson plans, 
literacy assessment tools and interactive 
learning materials. The Verizon Foundation unveiled a 
revamped Thinkfinity.org in March 
2007 with a three-year, $31 million 
commitment to make it the most useful 
and trusted source for educational 
resources on the Internet. 
Wilhoit said the need for a digital 
education platform is great. “There are 
very few high-quality materials that 
teachers can use, especially now when 
students are moving to technology-
based training, ” he said. “When you can

Educators across the country have 
affirmed its quality and usefulness. 
For the second year in a row, a survey 
of readers conducted by Edutopia —a 
leading education magazine—rated 
Thinkfinity.org the best Web site for

To describe Thinkfinity.org’s 
usefulness, middle school teacher 
Christy Wrede cited a lesson plan 
she used with her students on the 
Fibonacci Series (named after a 13th 
century mathematician), which is a 
sequence of numbers where, after 
two starting values, each number 
is the sum of the two preceding 
numbers—1,1,2,3,5,8,13…etc. 
The Thinkfinity.org lesson (http://
illuminations.nctm.org/lessons/
GoldenRatio/Golden-OVH-Nature.

petals on most flowers is almost 
always a Fibonacci number, which is 
why four-leafed clovers are so rare; 
that is, four is not a Fibonacci number.Thinkfinity.org

 Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report   | 25“If I’m giving a geometry lesson, I can 
go to Thinkfinity and find applications 
and lesson plans provided by the 
National Council of Teachers of 
Mathematics, ” Wrede said. “Then I 
can pull anything up and project it 
onto the ‘smart board’ (an interactive, 
electronic white board designed to 
enhance instruction and learning).
“When I was in school, the lessons 
were cut and dried, ” she added. “You 
just did it, but you didn’t necessarily 
understand why. But with the materials 
I can find on Thinkfinity, the students 
pay attention a lot better because they 
see the lesson in an interactive way, 
so they end up understanding the 
why of things more so than before. ”
Thinkfinity Literacy Network
Literacy is a fundamental requirement 
for nearly every level of achievement 
and success, yet in the United States, 40 
million people cannot read a prescription 
label or fill out a job application.
To address the issue, Thinkfinity.org 
provides content that includes best-in-class, 
evidence-based literacy resources from 
two of its partners—the National Center for 
Family Literacy and ProLiteracy Worldwide.
A key element in our effort is the 
Thinkfinity Literacy Network, which 
offers lessons and online courses for 
basic literacy and English as a second 
language; “how-to” instruction on 
everything from program development 
to volunteer recruiting; databases 
that match learners and volunteers 
with literacy programs in their area; 
research on literacy practices and 
measurements; and an assessment 
tool for literacy development. 
In addition, the Thinkfinity Literacy 
Network provides literacy instructors, 
librarians, students, volunteers and 
program managers with more than 50 
courses and more than 5,000 online “A lot of companies want to sell  
 products in the education space,  
 but Thinkfinity is free. It’s a model  
 for where education needs to go. ”
 Gene Wilhoit 
 Executive director of The Council of Chief State School Officersresources, plus access to other resources 
via partnerships with organizations such 
as the American Library Association.
A Model for Education
Thinkfinity.org also includes a 
comprehensive professional 
development series that prepares 
educators to incorporate its resources 
into their instructional settings.
As Verizon continues to build networks 
for the future, we’ll also continue to 
incorporate emerging technologies and 
communication tools that will allow 
for universal access to Thinkfinity.org's 
learning opportunities. Improvements 
slated for 2008 include a remodeled, 
easier-to-navigate Web site, Spanish-
language content, and after-school and 
home programs.
Boosting literacy rates and providing 
world-class education resources through 
Thinkfinity.org provide significant 
returns to Verizon: consumers are better 
prepared to use the digital technologies 
we’re deploying, and students are primed 
for success in the 21st century workplace.
“A lot of companies want to sell products 
in the education space, but Thinkfinity is 
free, ” Wilhoit said. 
“It’s a model for where education  
needs to go. ”The men and women of Verizon have a

Verizon’s philanthropy uses our financial, human and technological 
resources to address the social issues that are critical to the success of  
our business and the well-being of the communities where our employees 
and customers live. 
In 2007, our philanthropy was focused on education and literacy, family

DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE  PREVENTION
The Verizon Foundation’s second annual Domestic Violence Awareness 
Summit was held in State College, Pennsylvania in September 2007, in 
partnership with host Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, 
University of Kentucky and the National Network to End Domestic Violence.
The college setting was purposeful: statistics show that up to 25 percent 
of women will be assaulted during their college career. The summit was 
focused on educating potential victims and the entire community about 
what they can do if they fear a friend or acquaintance is in danger.
The summit also highlighted domestic violence awareness, prevention and 
training programs that are funded by the Verizon Foundation: 
• A training program on “Workplace Responses to Domestic Violence” 
designed by Penn State University for employees and students;
• A two-year program at Rutgers University to train professionals to 
identify domestic violence victims and teach appropriate techniques to 
intervene and assist victims; and
• A research program at the University of Kentucky designed to create a 
comprehensive picture of the effects of domestic violence.

PROTECTING  THE  ENVIRONMENT
32 | Doing the Work 20072007 O VERVIEW
Verizon is a global business with one of the largest private vehicle fleets  
in the U.S., and millions of square feet of real estate. The fact is, it takes a  
lot of energy to keep our networks running 24x7. That’s why we hold 
ourselves responsible for finding ways to reduce our environmental  
impact and be more efficient.
In 2007 we continued delivering on our principal environmental objectives: 
reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, increase recycling rates and deploy new, 
energy-saving technologies in our operations. (See also our environmental 
policy at http://www22.verizon.com/pages/environment.) 
We also made it a priority in 2007 to make consumers and policymakers 
aware that broadband technology can significantly reduce energy 
consumption and conserve resources and should be a factor in 21st 
century global energy policies. 
 
Verizon’s Environmental Impact
• We occupy more than 31,000 facilities worldwide. 
• We operate more than 58,000 vehicles. 
• We consumed 9.4 billion kilowatt hours of electricity and 60 million  
gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel in 2007.
• Our primary environmental impact: energy usage, materials used to 
build our network, disposal of spent materials.Broadband:  
The Green Network
A 2007 study by the American Consumer 
Institute* found that the widespread  
use of broadband services by consumers  
and businesses could reduce CO2 and  
other greenhouse-gas emissions by  
nearly one billion tons over 10 years.  
The reductions include: 
• 206.3 million tons from e-commerce
• 247.7 million tons from telecommuting
•  199.8 million tons from a 10 percent 
reduction in airline travel brought about 
by teleconferencing
•  67.2 million tons through a reduction 
in first-class mail, plastics saved from 
downloading music and videos, and 
office paper from e-mails and electronic 
documents, and
•  57.4 million tons by shifting newspaper 
subscriptions from physical distribution to 
online media.

100 are expected to be purchased this 
year. The hybrids—Toyota Prius sedans 
now in use in California, the District 
of Columbia, New York, New Jersey 
and Virginia—are expected to reduce 
emissions by more than 500 metric tons 
and save 60,000 gallons of fuel annually. Energy Conservation
• Verizon’s energy conservation measures reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions by 76,000 metric tons in 2007.
• Verizon’s Carbon Intensity is nearly eight times below the U.S. average.  
(See chart on page 34.)
• Verizon Wireless deployed more than 7,000 energy-efficient “thin client” 
computers in 12 call centers during 2007. Power consumption tests in  
one facility following deployment showed a 30 percent decrease in 
energy usage.
• Verizon Wireless rolled out power management software on 61,000 
desktop systems nationwide that provided automatic shutdown and 
“sleep” functions. The move resulted in a 24 percent reduction in  
PC power consumption. 
Waste Reduction and Recycling
• In 2007, Verizon was inducted into the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s WasteWise Hall of Fame, in recognition of our waste-prevention 
and recycling programs (www22.verizon.com/pages/environment). 
• Last year, nearly 28 percent of our $11.6 million in expenditures for office 
supplies went toward products with recycled content. 
• Through HopeLine, Verizon collects, refurbishes and reuses cell phones 
to provide free phone and service to domestic violence victims. Last year, 
we collected more than 1 million cell phones for the first time, up nearly 
17 percent from 2006. (See chart on page 35.) Since 2001, more than 4.5 
million cell phones have been collected.PROTECTING  THE  ENVIRONMENT  (continued)
34 | Doing the Work 2007• Our participation in the eTree program with Computershare and 
American Forests enables a tree to be planted for every Verizon 
shareholder who agrees to receive electronic annual reports and proxies 
instead of paper copies and for every Verizon Business customer who 
opts for paperless billing. In 2007, more than 1,700 trees were planted  
via this program. 
• In 2007, we sent over 17 million paperless bills to customers and 
processed approximately 100 million online payments, reducing 
combined paper usage by more than 770 tons.
Energy-Saving Technology
• Verizon continues to expand its use of energy-efficient Hypalon roofs on 
buildings throughout our territory. Hypalon roofs have highly reflective 
surfaces and increased insulation that save energy.
Climate Change Initiatives
• Verizon is a member of the Global eSustainability Initiative’s (GeSI) 
Climate Change Working Group. GeSI’s mission is to encourage 
greater use of information and communications technology to reduce 
greenhouse-gas emissions.
• Verizon also participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project  
(www.cdproject.net), which now has the largest registry of corporate 
greenhouse-gas emissions data. Verizon has reported emissions since the 
Project began in 2001.
• Verizon joined the California Climate Action Registry in 2006 and 
participates in the Business Roundtable Climate Resolve program.

Environmental 
Incidents/Complaints
Verizon Wireless harnesses the power of the 
sun to extend our wireless network to  
remote areas. The site shown below in 
California’s remote desert is one of the 
company’s eight solar powered cell sites in the 
western United States, some requiring access 
by helicopter. Each has solar-charged battery 
backup power for cloudy days.
Verizon Business is installing hydrogen fuel 
cells for back-up power at two regeneration 
sites in Missouri and another in Texas. The 
fuel cells enhance the reliability of the sites, 
while reducing the number of batteries and 
the amount of energy required for cooling.
Verizon Business is also installing more energy-
efficient equipment as part of an upgrade to its 
fiber-optic network. The network had required 
a regenerator each 35 to 45 miles, but newer 
technology eliminates the need for nearly a 
third of the existing regeneration sites. 
Once complete, energy consumption could  
be reduced by 1 16 million kilowatt hours  
per year, or 86,000 
metric tons of CO2 
emissions—equivalent 
to taking almost 
16,000 passenger cars 
off of the highway.

Verizon continues to be one of America’s leading employers, major taxpayers 
and largest purchasers of goods and services. The impact of our size and 
scale alone on community growth is significant.
But our networks are the principal instruments through which we  
contribute to society. The broadband era we are ushering in is creating 
the jobs of the future, making communities more competitive and driving 
innovation and growth. 
We clearly have the best networks in the world and we continued 
investing—a record $17.5 billion capital investment in 2007 —to make those 
connections as powerful and reliable as possible. And we intend to make our 
broadband technologies available to everyone. 
Our wireless network has clearly been the best in a very competitive field, 
creating record levels of customer loyalty. FiOS, our super-speed fiber 
network that reaches all the way to customers’ premises, now passes more 
than 9.3 million homes. Verizon is also a leader in providing the global IP

Highlights of 2007 Supplier Diversity Efforts
• The Human Resources Committee of the Verizon Board of Directors 
implemented a change to the 2007 annual incentive plan to tie supplier 
diversity success to Short-Term Incentive compensation. 
• In 2007, Verizon awarded a contract to Bartech, an African American-
owned company, to handle specific administrative tasks within Verizon’s 
Human Resources group. The contract is one of the largest ever awarded 
by Verizon to a minority business enterprise.Where did the paper go?
Walk into the Matthew:25 Medical Clinic 
in Fort Wayne, Indiana and you’ll find a 
thriving medical practice not unlike those 
in any suburb or affluent community. 
But Matthew:25 is actually a free clinic in 
inner-city Fort Wayne. 
Despite the modern 
surroundings and 
caring staff, no patient 
pays. Nor does any 
government. It’s fully 
funded by private 
donations.
What makes it even 
more remarkable is what you don’t see. Paper 
medical records. The clinic and others in Fort 
Wayne are part of a network of facilities using 
all electronic medical records. Doctors in any 
Fort Wayne hospital or other medical facility 
already have access to today’s latest file on 
the patient in need of urgent care. 
Verizon is working to make electronic records 
the standard not the exception. Chairman 
and CEO Ivan Seidenberg leads a committee 
of business leaders in Washington, DC urging 
the government to remove hurdles to safe, 
secure and widespread use of electronic 
medical records.
Sixty-thousand low-income citizens are

EMPOWERING  EMPLO yEES
Supporting employees  
on active duty
Verizon supports employees like Rich  
Wince when they are called to active 
military duty with one of the most 
generous military-leave programs offered 
by any U.S. company.
Wince is a computer systems engineer  
for Verizon IT.  He was on active duty in  
the National Guard for approximately  
two years, serving in Washington State.
Verizon pays the difference between an 
employee’s military pay and Verizon pay 
for up to 36 months. The company also 
continues medical, dental, vision and  
group life insurance for employees and 
eligible dependents. 
Given the continued service of so many 
Verizon employees, this program was 
extended in September 2007 by 36 months.  
More than 90 Verizon employees are 
currently on active duty with the National 
Guard and the Reserves. Our employees 
have served in Afghanistan, Iraq and 
surrounding countries, or have played 
crucial roles here at home.

Verizon is a great place to work—a company that people are proud to say 
they work for and others want to join. 
We expect a lot from people, holding ourselves to very high standards of 
performance and accountability. In return, those expectations are matched 
by compensation and benefits that are among the best in corporate America, 
lots of opportunities for learning and career advancement, and useful 
programs for balancing the demands of work and home. 
The opportunities for personal development remain a Verizon hallmark.  
Our total employee development and training investment reached  
$371 million in 2007. 
Our approach to health care is to empower our people to manage and 
improve their health, and that of the families, by offering access to 
meaningful resources and encouraging preventive care. 
We enhanced our line-up of benefits in 2007 to reflect prevalent family issues 
and expanded our Verizon HealthZone—a confidential online resource that 
employees can use to learn about and manage their health. A key feature: a 
Personal Health Record application. Verizon HealthZone now reaches more 
than 132,000 employees. 
Respect for diversity is an integral part of the Verizon culture and a critical 
element in our strategy to compete and deliver the best customer experiences. 
We recognize the competitive advantage that comes from having employees 
with diverse backgrounds, life experiences and points of view who can relate to 
customers, speak their languages and reflect our markets.

40 | Doing the Work 2007Better Health
• Verizon spends nearly $4 billion annually on health care, equivalent 
to 4 percent of 2007 revenues. We offer access to health care for 
approximately 900,000 Verizon employees, retirees and dependents. 
Ninety-four percent of eligible employees have chosen health coverage. 
• While most of our health plans cover preventive and detection 
screenings at 100 percent, our analysis showed this benefit was 
underutilized. We increased efforts to raise awareness and encourage 
early detection by offering on-site services such as flu shots and 
mammography screenings. On-site flu shots and mammography 
screenings jumped 40 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in 2007. 
• In selecting companies that make up our slate of health plan offerings, 
Verizon now weighs how they are addressing—and reducing—the racial 
and ethnic disparities in health care.
• Partnering with key health plans has led to the availability of a number 
of new services for employees and retirees to use in managing—and 
improving—their health:
■ Access to 24/7assistance from nurses to help employees navigate 
through their health plans and manage health conditions
■ Information on physicians and facilities within health plan networks
■ Information that identifies leading physicians and facilities that meet 
quality criteria, and
■ Online programs that educate employees on lower-cost alternatives 
for long-term maintenance medications.
Learning & Development
 • Verizon employees logged 11.5 million training hours in 2007 versus 8  
million in 2006. The training covered everything from compliance issues 
to management techniques, but the increase in hours was largely driven 
by employees improving broadband-, mobile- and IP-related skills.
• Verizon total 2007 training investment: $259 million.
• Training  magazine named Verizon Wireless among the best companies in 
providing training for employees in 2007— for the sixth consecutive year. Verizon Foundation  
Scholarship Program
Verizon’s commitment to education 
begins at home—with our employees. The 
Verizon Foundation Scholarship Program 
awards the children of employees with 
college scholarships of $5,000 per year, 
renewable for three additional years for a 
maximum of $20,000 over four years. 
Scholarships awarded for the 2007-2008 
school year are part of our $4.8 million 
investment in the education of 957 Verizon 
scholars – 250 freshmen and 707 others 
who already are enrolled in colleges and 
universities throughout the United States. 
In all, Verizon has invested more than 
$27.7 million in the college education 
of the children of Verizon employees, 
assisting more than 1 ,800 students across 
the country since 2001.

Employee fatalities 0 in 2005 9 in 2006 1 in 2007
• One employee fatality occurred in 2007. The fatality was associated with 
an electrical incident. While this is a significant decrease from 2006, any 
loss of life is unacceptable. 
• We continue to place a strong emphasis on safety and evaluate our safety 
management system to improve our effectiveness. In 2007, independent 
audits were conducted and associated action plans for continuous 
improvement were put in place. There was also an increase in training, 
safety observations and communications throughout 2007. That will 
continue in 2008.

Our network.  
Open network.
Verizon set the stage in 2007 for the 
next era of innovation and growth 
in the wireless market with two 
landmark announcements. 
First, Verizon Wireless announced 
it will provide customers the 
option to use, on its nationwide 
network, wireless devices, software 
and applications not offered by 
the company that meet technical 
standards. Plans are to have the 
new option available to customers 
throughout the country by 
the end of 2008. We held our 
first-ever Open Development 
Conference on March 19, 2008.
Verizon Wireless also announced 
plans to develop its fourth-generation 
broadband network using Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) technology, with trials 
starting in 2008.
42 | Doing the Work 20072007 O VERVIEW
Verizon continued to energize the marketplace in 2007, deploying industry-
leading broadband wireless, wireline and IP technologies. This year was 
marked, however, by the roll out of several products and services that 
address social concerns and the needs of our diverse customers.
Verizon expanded the line-up of products and services for customers with 
disabilities and special needs such as a mobile phone designed for aging 
adults, an “Accessibility Corner” in our retail locations, new videophone 
services for hearing-impaired customers and wireless parental controls. 
Verizon also continued to be leading advocate for applying the capabilities 
inherent in our high-speed broadband networks to improving the quality of 
health care and reducing associated costs. (Read about one such initiative in 
Fort Wayne, Indiana on page 20.) 
To address today’s new media, we were joined by several governors and 
attorneys general among other officials in a series of community forums to 
raise awareness with parents and their kids about online safety. 
Improving our customer service is a top priority for Verizon. Our goal is to be 
the company that sets the benchmark for great service in our industry in the 
digital era. In 2007 we inaugurated a new service measure that, along with 
our commitment to put customers first, will help us reach that plateau.

 Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report  | 43• In 2007 Verizon Wireless introduced its 30-day Test Drive—an industry 
first—that lets customers experience its network virtually risk-free for 30 
days. If customers are not satisfied with their experience and take their 
number to another carrier, Verizon Wireless will refund their money for 
calls, equipment, activation fee and taxes.
• The company enhanced its Spanish-language Web site,  
www.verizonwireless.com/espanol , offering more content, expanded 
features and enhanced support for customers who prefer to browse, buy 
or manage their individual accounts online in Spanish. 
• The company revised its policies to make it easier for customers in the 
military to manage their accounts when called to active duty. Under the 
new policy, active military personnel may suspend their accounts for up to 
48 months.
• In August 2007, the company unveiled its expanded national test lab, 
designed to ensure that every device used on the company’s network 
meets the highest standards of reliability and provides customers with the 
best possible wireless experience. 
Verizon Telecom
• At the end of 2007, Verizon had passed about 9.3 million homes and 
businesses in parts of 17 states with its high-speed fiber-to-the-premises 
network, FiOS.
• Verizon ended 2007 as the 10th largest video provider in the United 
States, with 943,000 FiOS TV customers.

Sonny Perdue
Governor of GeorgiaPartnership for a  
Child-Safe Internet
Governor Sonny Perdue of Georgia 
(below) joined Verizon and other 
organizations in a town hall meeting 
in October 2007 to support education 
initiatives that will help families ensure 
children are using the Internet safely 
and responsibly.
Also participating in the gathering, 
which was held in Atlanta, were 
members of the Georgia Bureau of 
Investigation, Georgia Emergency 
Management Agency and Georgia 
Public Broadcasting.   
We’ve held similar town hall meetings 
in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, 
New York, Tennessee and Delaware. 
Discussions at these events focus on 
how parents can get the online tools 
to keep their children safe and what 
law enforcement agencies are doing 
to create a more secure Internet. More 
forums are planned in 2008.
We feel a strong responsibility to 
help ensure a safer, more enjoyable 
Internet, while addressing the 
challenges to privacy and security 
posed by today’s new media. 
In our view, the online world 
will reach its full potential only 
if consumers trust that their 
online experiences will 
be positive and their 
privacy will be 
protected. 
44 | Doing the Work 2007• Verizon unveiled the next generation of our FiOS TV service, making it 
easier for consumers to find and manage content on their TVs. At the 
heart of the innovation is the new, Verizon-built, interactive media guide.
• In 2007, Verizon introduced a FiOS Internet service with upload and 
download speeds of up to 20 megabits-per-second—ideal for uploading 
large files to businesses from work-at-home employees. 
Verizon Business  
• Verizon Business continued to expand its global IP network, adding 
private IP nodes in the Philippines and Malaysia. It also rolled out its 
next-generation, ultra long-haul optical transport network in Europe and 
successfully conducted the industry’s first field test of 100 gigabits-per-
second optical transmission.
• The Verizon Business IP network now includes more than 485,000  
route miles, spanning six continents. The company provides high-  
capacity connections to more than 120,000 buildings in 2,700 cities 
around the globe. 
• Verizon Business expanded its security portfolio by offering retailers and 
financial service companies stronger safeguards for protecting credit card 
holders’ confidential data. 
• Verizon Business is also a founding partner in a consortium that is building 
the Trans Pacific Express—the first next-generation undersea optical cable 
system directly linking the U.S. mainland and China. 
• In July 2007, Verizon Business acquired Cybertrust, a privately-held 
provider of global information security services. The combination makes 
Verizon Business the leading provider of managed information security 
services to large business and government customers worldwide. Verizon Parental Controls
In today’s busy digital age, information is 
available everywhere. To help customers 
manage that information, Verizon has 
developed a Parental Controls Program 
that makes their experiences in the 
digital age enjoyable and safer for 
broadband Internet, wireless and FiOS TV.
Verizon Online: Verizon Internet  
Security Suite protects Internet users

 Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report  | 45• Verizon Video Conferencing is helping EDS, a leading global technology 
services company, target a 25 percent reduction in its carbon emissions in 
Australia and New Zealand by 2010. 
 EDS deployed Verizon Video Conferencing over Verizon Private IP to 
connect 10 of its sites across Australia and New Zealand. By increasing the 
use of video conferencing, EDS plans to improve collaboration across its 
operations, and reduce employee air travel by nearly a third. 
A Clear, Consistent Measure of Performance
Verizon unveiled a new way to measure the satisfaction and loyalty of 
customers in 2008. The new measure—which is targeted primarily at 
consumers and small business owners—is built around asking them a simple, 
basic question:
“How likely is it that you would recommend Verizon to a friend or 
colleague…and why do you feel that way?”
We’ve constructed the system to ensure we get feedback from customers 
in their own words about exactly what they want us to keep doing, where 
we can improve and what really concerns them. We believe this will yield a 
better understanding of how people view our products and services and, 
ultimately, help us find ways to improve the customer experience.

46 | Doing the Work 2007As a global company, Verizon is a catalyst for 
economic development overseas as well in the U.S. 
Our investment creates jobs and stimulates growth 
across our entire supply chain.
We bring to our global markets the same values 
that guide our domestic operations, including 
participation in activities that promote community 
growth. Increasingly Verizon employees around the 
world—more than 10,000 strong in more than 320 
offices in 75 countries outside the U.S.—are finding 
ways to turn Verizon’s technology and resources into 
tangible benefits for communities.
Verizon is helping unlock the promise of 
literacy for children, adults and families 
living outside the U.S.
Our international focus on the problem 
was exemplified with the Verizon 
Foundation’s participation in a 2005 
summit hosted by Georgetown University 
to support UNESCO’s (United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization) Education for All program. 
In 2007, the Verizon Foundation was 
the sole corporate sponsor of the India 
Regional Conference in Support of Community Activities 
in Global Markets
Global Literacy, held in New Delhi. The 
conference was one of six regional events 
held by UNESCO as part of its drive to 
promote literacy at national, regional and 
international levels. 
We also worked with Georgetown 
University and ProLiteracy Worldwide in 
2007 to develop literacy resources that will 
be hosted on the school’s Global Education 
Consortium (GEC) portal. The GEC is a 
network of 100 universities around the 
world devoted to improving literacy. 
 Verizon Corporate Responsibility Report  | 47Employees at Verizon Data Services India 
have been volunteering for nearly two years 
to mentor students at the Olcott School in 
Chennai. A 2007 Verizon Foundation grant—
the first grant issued by the Foundation in 
India—will bring much-needed equipment 
to help students improve their English and 
computer skills.
Above, Olcott Principal Mrs. Lakshmi 
Suryanarayanan speaks with students           
at   the school. Verizon Business employees in Brazil, 
including Ricardo Nanni shown here, 
volunteered their time during the last holiday 
season to support to residents of a poor 
community in São Paulo, preparing meals 
and organizing activities. The São Paulo-
based employees are planning to organize 
similar activities on a quarterly basis in 2008.
In Argentina, Verizon Business employees 
conducted several notable volunteer 
campaigns last year; including a toy drive to 
benefit two Buenos Aires hospitals.  In 2007 
the Verizon Foundation also made a grant to 
FundaciónLeer (Reading is Fundamental) in 
Buenos Aires to support literacy.The Verizon Foundation also made a grant 
in 2007 to the Central Berkshire Education
