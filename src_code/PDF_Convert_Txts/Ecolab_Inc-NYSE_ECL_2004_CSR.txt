OHG.Ecolab has always had a strong sustainability track record. To us, a company that focuses on environmental, social and economicperformance is good for society andgood for business. As part of Ecolab’sfocus on sustainable growth, I ampleased to present this expanded 2004 Sustainability Report.  
Ecolab is an industry leader in providing superior value to our customers
while helping conserve resources and preserve the quality of the environment. Our long-term success is due, in part, to Ecolab’s adoption of three key principles of sustainable business development: stewardship to the environment, contributions to society and the creation of economic value for our shareholders. However, the real key has been the dedication of our people who continually find ways to deliver better product solutions for our customers in ways that better preserve our environment.
We also have a long-standing commitment to the communities where our 
associates live and work. Through the Ecolab Foundation, we contributedmore than $3.3 million in 2004 toward building sustainable communities. We also contributed $1.4 million worth of cleaning products toward the tsunami relief effort in Asia. We encourage and foster volunteerism amongour associates as individuals by offering matching grants to organizations in which they volunteer or are elected as board members. 
In addition, Ecolab associates share a common culture, comprised of six 
universal values: spirit, pride, determination, commitment, passion and integrity.
These are much more than mere words. Our culture is a vital, tangible forcewithin our company, one that transcends geography and language, and driveseverything we do as an organization. It is a calling we take on the same way we take on everything else we do at Ecolab – with energy, enthusiasm and commitment. A Message fromEcolab President and CEO

Sustainability Management Philosophy
Ecolab adopted Environmental Principles to guide its business strategy more
than 15 years ago. Ecolab’s management believes that corporations shouldconduct their business as responsible stewards of the environment and in amanner that does not disrupt the earth’s natural evolutionary processes. They must also not compromise the ability of future generations to sustain their needs.
Ecolab applies its Environmental Principles on a global basis. In Europe, 
for example, the company has incorporated environmental, health and safety, and quality management systems into an integrated management system thatadheres to the U.N. Sustainable Development Charter. Ecolab adheres to the charter by applying responsible care principles in product development, technical operations and service processes at customer sites. Specific environmental and quality objectives are defined and reviewed in regular business plans, including having European management systems certificated according to the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards. 0500,0001,000,0001,500,0002,000,0002,500,0003,000,000Post-consumer recycled plastic (lbs.)1996

2003Sustainability in Product Development
Products and Systems
Consistent with our sustainability objectives, we are expanding our portfolio of “environmentally responsible” cleaning products. These products meet environmental attributes relating to chemistry, packaging, training, dispensingcontrols and other sustainability factors. In Europe, Ecolab sells 16 productscertified by Nordic Swan
®as environmentally preferable. In North America,
Ecolab launched the EcoLogic line of housekeeping products, including 
products certified by Green Seal®. We also are participating in the U.S. EPA’s
Design for the Environment Green Formulation Initiative to develop guidelines for environmentally preferable ingredients.
Packaging Reduction
On a global basis, Ecolab works to reduce product packaging. We introduced award-winning collapsible packaging designs for several new products in 2004. By using flexiblepouches instead of rigid plastic bottles, we havereduced the amount of plastic introduced intothe waste system. For example, in Australia were-use 76 percent of our packaging. In North America, Ecolab designs its rigid plastic packaging (less than 5 gallon size) with more than 15 percent post-consumer recycled (PCR) material. Charts below show Ecolab’s growing usage of PCR material in Ecolab’s North American polyethylenepackaging – doubling the amount of recycled plastic since 1996.

Sustainable Product Design
On a global basis, Ecolab has launched new skin cleansers formulated withalkylpolyglucosides (APGs) -- made from naturally renewable resources thatalso provide less irritancy and degrade without environmental harm. In addition to these bio-based sustainable ingredients, we have developed cleaning products with low alkalinity, low metal ion content and reducedphosphorous content. New dry conveyor lubricants reduce our beverage plantcustomers’ wastewater volume. To reduce our customers’ water and energyimpacts, we have implemented the Aquamiser laundry system. For new 
product development, evaluation of environmental aspects is a standard step within our integrated quality and environmental management system in Europe and our development process worldwide.

COMMITMENTEcolab’s commitment to sustainability
begins with a systematic approach to creating products, programs andservices that are not only effective,but reduce safety risks and environmental impacts. Our holisticapproach emphasizes closed systems that minimize opportunitiesfor exposing people to chemicals.For example, we have developed concentrated products, like soliddetergents and dispensing systems,that enhance worker safety andreduce the volume of shipments and resulting fuel usage.

Releases to the Air/Environment 
As required by the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act (EPCRA), 17 Ecolab facilities make available information about releases of EPA-listed chemicals to the environment. The primary chemicals releasedfrom Ecolab plants are formula components that evaporate during production. Over the past decade, Ecolab’s U.S. production of cleaning products more than doubled. However, Ecolab’s releases to the environment(in pounds) in the U.S. have declined over the same period.

Ecolab strives to maximize the energy efficiency of our products and 
services and minimize the amount of energy consumed in manufacturing our products. The following graphs show the cost of energy consumed to produce 1,000 pounds of product in our North American manufacturing facilities and the kilowatt hours of energy used to produce one metric ton(2,200 pounds) of product in our European facilities. We are working to standardize our reporting metrics in future years.

2004Customer Safety Right-to-Know 
To assist customers in handling Ecolab products safely, Ecolab provides
Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) with health and safety information about each product. Ecolab is investing in a new MSDS authoring system in Europe and North America that will help provide up-to-date, consistentsafety information in the local language, and in compliance with tighteningregulatory requirements for MSDS. This system will help Ecolab’s customersreceive current safety information in their preferred language. As shown inthe following charts, Ecolab sent out approximately 500,000 MSDS to U.S. customers in 2004.

To help customers with medical emergencies involving Ecolab products,
Ecolab provides a toll-free emergency telephone number on all productlabels. This process helps customers and medical personnel respond to emergencies. In the long run, this customer support helps reduce injuries and enhance customer loyalty.EHS Auditing
As a third-party check on Ecolab’s environmental, health and safety (EHS)
compliance in manufacturing operations, an outside EHS consultant (EarthTech, Inc.) audits each plant in North America every other year. Similarly, in Europe and Australia, an outside EHSconsultant (ERM) audits our plants. In addition, audits are performed whenfacilities are acquired. Ecolab’s propertyand casualty insurers conducted fire andworker safety assessments and pressurevessel certifications at Ecolab facilities. These auditing programs help us continuously improve our EHS performance. The increase in 2002relates primarily to facilities associatedwith Ecolab’s acquisition of the formerHenkel-Ecolab joint venture in Europe.
ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 environmental management system is a voluntary system for managing environmental aspects of business operations, somewhat similar to the ISO 9000 quality system. This sought-after designation includes guidelines forhow organizations work to prevent pollution, conform to legal requirements,minimize impact on the environment and continuously improve environmental performance. In Europe, Ecolab maintains ISO 14001 environmental management certification for 11 operational units (10 production sites and Düsseldorf headquarters). In 2004, Ecolab expanded its ISO 14001 environmental management certification to production plants in Japan and Singapore, as well as Australia.
