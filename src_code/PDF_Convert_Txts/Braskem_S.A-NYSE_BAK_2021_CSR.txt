Braskem Idesa   2021 Sustainability ReportThis year, we saw significant developments in our operations 
thanks to continuous production throughout the year, 
substituting Natural Gas for ethane to help ensure the 
continuity of our processes. We also started building our new 
Ethane Terminal, which will provide the raw materials we 
require to operate. In financial and environmental terms, we 
refinanced our entire Project Finance debt structure, helping 
to achieve our zero-emission goal by 2050.
In compliance with reporting methodology, we declare that 
“this report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI 
Standards: Core option stipulated by the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI)”. Furthermore, there were no modifications to 
the information, which has been verified by an external party. 
In addition to our sustainability strategy and vision, we are 
working on a new materiality to  update material issues, which 
we will present in our next report.LETTER FROM  
THE CEOTHE CEO
2021 was a year of numerous achievements and challenges for Braskem 
Idesa, and we accomplished outstanding results by acting accordingly with a 
framework of transparency, ethics and integrity at all levels within the company 
and with all our stakeholders.[102-14, 102-15]
We maintained operations at our industrial complex 
and our businesses despite the COVID-19 pandemic, 
focusing especially on driving a strong connection with 
our stakeholders – Team Members, investors, clients, 
suppliers and communities – rolling out on-going 
communication efforts and prioritizing their physical 
and emotional health through the implementation 
of numerous prevention measures, such as remote 
working and the development and creation of value 
propositions for our professionals who have shown 
high levels of resilience and commitment.
Furthermore, one of our non-negotiable values is the 
safety of our operations and people, having achieved 
positive results this year once again, on a par with the 
best petrochemical companies in the world.
In terms of operations at our complex, one major pillar 
of our business is the access to raw materials (ethane 
gas), and this year we reached two milestones: firstly, 
our Fast Track project, which began operating last 
year at the Integrated Port Administration (API) in 
Coatzacoalcos, has enabled us to import ethane to 
help increase our access to raw materials; secondly, 
during 2020, we experienced a unilateral interruption 
in natural gas supplies, which led us to implement a 
strategy to resume operations and mitigate the effects 
on the value chain.As a result of this situation, in 2021 we reopened 
discussions with the Mexican government and with 
PEMEX, leading to an addendum to the ethane supply 
contract we signed in 2010 that includes new supply 
conditions that benefit both parties. This agreement 
also resulted in PEMEX and other government agencies 
committing to the construction of a permanent 
ethane import terminal, representing an investment of 
USD $400 million, which will allow us to drive efficiency 
and guarantee sufficient ethane supply to operate 
our plant at 100% of its capacity, increase availability, 
and drive our competitiveness within the polyethylene 
market in Mexico, which is a structural part of our long-
term business.
Furthermore, and thanks to this long-term agreement 
to supply ethane as a raw material, we were able to issue 
a USD $1.2-billion bond on the international capital 
markets, which, in addition to the bond we issued in 
2019, has allowed Braskem Idesa to restructure its 
capital and free up resources to drive the company’s 
growth through investments, the terminal project, and 
sustainability projects, which are of key importance 
over the coming years. This bond was issued, in line with 
our sustainability vision and commitment, through a 
Sustainability Linked Bond (SLB) that represents our 
commitment to reducing Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions by 15% by 2028, helping to drive 
our strategy, which began in 2021, through projects and 
actions to help fulfil our commitment.

 REPORTLETTER FROM 
THE CEO[102-14, 102-15]
In terms of sustainability, we are governed by our Global 
Sustainable Development Policy, which is based on the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), 
and in the understanding that economic challenges, 
the scarcity of natural resources, and climate change 
require urgent action and adaptation. This is why our 
sustainability strategy is based on 7 macro-objectives 
(Health and Safety, Economic and Financial Results, 
Plastic Waste, Operational Eco-Efficiency, Climate 
Change, Social Responsibility, and Human Rights and 
Sustainable Innovation). I would like to emphasize the 
advances that we have made in the Circular Economy 
through the development of sustainable solutions 
for our clients, including Post-Consumer Recycled 
(PCR) polyethylene, our Emissions Reduction Plan, 
social management, and our commitment to the 
communities within our areas of influence.
In terms of the Circular Economy, we saw a major shift 
in the production and sale of PCR resin, and we created a 
joint venture through a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) with the Mexican recycling company Alcamare. 
This joint venture is the combination of our experience 
in business, technology and logistics and their 
experience in the field of collection and recycling, the 
result of which has been a three-fold increase in the 
production and sale of this product compared to 2020. 
We have focused on the Mexican market, and we also 
export to Central America and the United States.
We are also involved in on-going projects with our value 
chain through partnerships, technology generation, 
innovation, and the development of collaborative 
projects to promote education surrounding recycling 
and responsible consumption. We also lobby for 
adequate legislation, highlighting how plastics improve 
people’s lives and reaffirming how this change cannot 
be brought about alone.During 2021, we maintained our social license to 
operate by driving harmonious, transparent and clear 
communication and interaction with the communities 
located within our complex’s area of social influence. 
We achieved this through a range of community 
engagement programs that focus on creating jobs, 
developing the local economy, and ensuring the health 
and safety of people within the community.
For all of us at Braskem Idesa, it is of the utmost 
importance that we continue developing our human 
capital and promoting issues such as diversity, 
inclusion, ethics and environmental conservation, all of 
which play a major role in our business and in the world. 
As a company, we are extremely proud of our 
achievements and contributions, and we are fully aware 
that there is still work to be done. We are committed 
to becoming an even more sustainable company 
that is underpinned by a strong culture of ethics and 
corporate governance in order to continue creating 
value for all our stakeholders.
In conclusion, I would like to thank our shareholders, 
clients and suppliers for the trust they have placed in 
us, and, above all, I would like to thank our team for their 
professionalism, commitment and passion, which has 
allowed us to continue positioning ourselves as a global 
benchmark.

Corporate Governance 
Our corporate governance comprises a Board of Directors that is tasked with 
managing our business. It is composed of 7 independent members, all of whom are 
experts in the chemical, petrochemical and plastics industry, and it meets at least 
once a quarter.
According to the Shareholder Agreement, Braskem can appoint 5 members to our 
Board and Idesa can appoint 2 members. Furthermore, the chair of our Board of 
Directors is not an executive at the company and has the same faculties as any 
other member of the Board. His or her function is to act as a link between the CEO 
and the Board, which is responsible for managing the company. 
The majority of the decisions considered by our Board must be passed by a simple 
majority, and the CEO is the person responsible for implementing the Business 
Plan and the decisions reached by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the 
policies, values and principles of the company.
Furthermore, our Board members can serve for 2 years, with the possibility of re-
election. The longest-serving director was appointed in April 2010, and the most 
recent director was appointed in January 2021.
Our corporate governance model operates within a framework that promotes an 
ethical, transparent and upright approach to how we treat our stakeholders. 
Our Board of Directors oversees the following committees:
• Compliance Committee: It supervises the 
activities of the company’s Chief Compliance 
Officer and provides support in terms of issues 
regarding our compliance system. The major 
issues this Committee focuses on deal with ethics, 
integrity and transparency, the Code of Conduct, 
the Anti-corruption Policy, and other standards, 
documents, communications and training in 
compliance, internal audits, risk management, 
internal controls, Ethics Line (our reporting 
channel), and data privacy and protection.—

Braskem Idesa   2021 Sustainability ReportIn light of this outlook, the Braskem Idesa team worked 
together to roll out measures to mitigate the impacts 
of these challenges. We expanded and streamlined our 
ethane import solution (Fast- Track) meeting more than 
40% of Braskem Idesa’s requirements. We successfully 
reached a definitive agreement with PEMEX, allowing 
us to resume natural gas and ethane supplies in the 
long term. We signed a support agreement with the 
government to develop an Ethane Import Terminal, a 
project that will guarantee 100% of Braskem Idesa’s 
ethane procurement requirements. 
We increased our asset utilization ratio from 58% 
at the beginning of the year to 81%. We fulfilled sales 
for more than 250 clients from different countries 
thanks to the flexibility of our logistics operations. We 
tripled sales of Post-Consumer Recycled Resin (PCR), 
LETTER FROM THE CHIEF 
FINANCIAL OFFICERFINANCIAL OFFICER   
2021 began as a challenging year for Braskem Idesa as a result of the effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, which led to an historic reduction in polyethylene prices, 
political uncertainty surrounding ethane supplies, and unilateral interruption 
of natural gas supplies that impeded operations at our complex. [102-7 , 201-2]
offering the market innovative solutions that are 
aligned with our Circular Economy commitments. As 
part of these commitments, we issued a sustainable 
bond totaling USD $1.2 billion, which, to date, makes 
it the largest private bond in Latin America. This 
enabled us to refinance the full amount of the original 
project financing. This sustainable bond is tied to our 
commitment to reducing Greenhouse Gases and 
complements our ESG strategy.
We remain committed to developing alternative sources 
of raw materials and greater operational efficiency by 
creating solutions and incentivizing investments in the 
Sustainable Economy. Meanwhile, we are reaffirming 
our commitment to the company’s financial health, 
compliance, corporate governance, and our overall 
commitment to transparency with our stakeholders.

Ethane Terminal Project – Terminal Química 
Puerto México 
PrevenirTERMINAL QUÍMICA 
Puerto Mexico  will begin ethane 
import operations in 2024.
Stemming from an agreement with PEMEX reached in 2021, Braskem Idesa 
began building a permanent terminal to receive ethane imports at the Integrated 
Port Administration (API) in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, with an investment of 
approximately USD $400 million. This terminal will play a major role in the operations of our petrochemical complex 
and for the region of Coatzacoalcos given that it will drive the independence of the complex’s operations and provide 
full availability of raw materials, leading to a rise in our production capacity of between 14% and 20%, an increase 
from 66,000 to 80,000 barrels per day (BPD) of ethane.
Terminal Química Puerto México (TQPM) will drive positive economic results within the region, as a result of:
1. New investments in the area and the subsequent economic spillover.
2. Increase in revenue at the Integrated Port Administration (API) in Coatzacoalcos as a result of increased freight 
flow.
3. Creation of new logistics chains.
4. Competition within the region.
5. Positive influence stemming from the creation of new jobs.
6. Consolidation of the competitiveness of the domestic petrochemical industry.
7. Improvements to regional logistics infrastructure.
8. Increased polyethylene production in Mexico and the substitution of imports, leading to a positive impact on 
trade balance.
9. Comprehensive solution to cover deficits in the amount of ethane required to fully meet domestic demand and 
increase the production of ethane/ethylene derivatives.Furthermore, Terminal Química Puerto México (TQPM) has undertaken a 
Social Impact Assessment (SIA), which identified the social and economic 
benefits of the construction of the terminal, which will begin operating in 
2024: 
• Local economic spillover and investment.
• Job creation during both the construction and subsequent operations.
• Promotion of the Interoceanic Corridor project.
• Training workshops for the general public in areas including: business, 
construction, customer service, security, and civil protection in 
conjunction with local and state authorities, in addition to the 
implementation of training sessions for micro start-ups.
Furthermore, the ethane terminal project has an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (MIA) and an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) in order 
to guarantee that the potential environmental impacts identified can be 
prevented or reduced through the implementation of mitigation measures, 
pursuant to Article 30 of the Ecological Balance and Environmental 
Conservation Act, which creates environmental programs, including: flora 
and fauna rescue programs, integrated waste management programs, and 
environmental education and awareness programs.

Water Efficiency 
At Braskem Idesa, we recognize the importance of 
promoting water conservation measures to protect 
this resource for future generations, which is why we 
have developed protocols and projects that focus on 
improving water management in our operations
Our production process requires water, which is 
used in steam generation, refrigeration systems, 
manufacturing processes and effluence disposal. 
Every single day, we strive to improve our water 
efficiency strategy, the goal of which is to diversify the 
sources from which we get our water and reuse within 
the services at our complex. Some of the measures 
contemplated within this strategy include: 
• Prior to building the complex, we undertook a 
number of studies to determine the water basins 
within the area, guaranteeing natural run-offs 
and identifying 6 rainwater discharges around 
the complex and 1 treated water discharge that 
empties into the Gopalapa River. 
• We undertake the biannual monitoring of 
groundwater and surface water within the 
communities surrounding our operations.
• We guarantee our water discharges comply 
with the 2018 Coatzacoalcos River Declaration, 
implementing a wastewater discharge system 
that ensures the river’s capacity is not exceeded, 
in addition to permitting natural degradation and 
the recovery of this body of water. 
• We extract surface water from the Uxpanapa 
River, which is transported from the dam to 
our petrochemical plant through our pumping 
plant. We clarify the water for its subsequent 
distribution and use, mainly to replace cooling 
water or to generate steam.  • We monitor the effluent discharges and ensure 
we comply with the control parameters set for 
each quarter.
• In addition to the environmental monitoring of 
our operations and as part of our commitment 
to environmental conservation within our area of 
social influence, our Participative Environmental 
Monitoring (MAP) community program, we 
sample water from 6 underground wells located in 
the communities of Lázaro Cárdenas, Nahualapa 
and Pollo de Oro (found on the Nanchital, Tepeyac 
and Gopalapa Rivers), which are located around 
the complex.

Biodiversity
Mexico’s flora and fauna is a part of the country’s 
cultural heritage for future generations; driving 
the conservation of ecosystems is of fundamental 
importance in achieving balance within the 
environment and tackling climate change. This is why 
biodiversity conservation has played a major role in our 
operations from the very outset.
We promote and foment research, education, 
and volunteering efforts in matter of biodiversity 
conservation, which is why, in 2016, we created an 
Environmental Management Unit (EMU) authorized 
by the Department of the Environment and Natural 
Resources (SEMARNAT) called El Benjamín, which 
covers an area comprising 100 hectares located 2.8 
kilometers from our Petrochemical Complex in the 
community of Ixhuatlán del Sureste in the state of 
Veracruz. This environmental conservation area is 
coordinated through its Management Plan, which 
was validated by government authorities focusing on 
environmental issues.
In this space, research and conservation studies of flora 
and fauna species were undertaken in the southern 
region of the Coatzacoalcos River Basin, in addition to 
environmental sampling at different times of the year 
(rainy season, dry season, hurricane season) in order 
to update the database of flora and fauna species 
recorded within the Environmental Management Unit 
(EMU).
As part of the EMU’s conservation programs, it 
focuses on protecting Ceratozamia Miqueliana, 
an endemic plant that is found on the Red List of 
Threatened Species and is protected by NOM-059-
SEMARNAT-2010 (Environmental Protection-Wild 
Flora and Fauna Species Native to Mexico), given the 
biological and ecological importance of this species. As 
part of Braskem Idesa’s commitment to the planet, we have focused on the protection and conservation of 
its habitat, achieving the following results through our 
programs:
• More than 1,200 Ceratozamia miqueliana 
plants were rescued and relocated within the 
Environmental Management Unit (APDC), and a 
demography study into Ceratozamia miqueliana 
was conducted with expert researchers.
• During 2021, a number of scientific articles covering 
flora and fauna were recorded.
• In 2021, a total of 474 species of flora and fauna were 
recorded within the Environmental Management 
Unit. 
• 167 species of flora recorded.• 307 species of fauna recorded -  73 species of 
invertebrate and 234 species of vertebrate:
 » Birds: 124 species
 » Mammals: 47 species
 » Reptiles: 41 species 
 » Amphibians: 22 species 
 » Ants: 49 species
 » Beetles: 15 species
 » Butterflies: 9 species
In 2021, 45 species of flora and fauna were identified 
as being found in a category protected by NOM-
059-SEMARNAT-2010 (Environmental Protection-
Wild Flora and Fauna Species Native to Mexico-Risk 
Categories and Specifications for Inclusion, Exclusion 
or Changes-List of At-Risk Species), of which: 
• 14 species are covered by CITES (Convention on

Environmental protection and conservation are the 
responsibility of every sector, both public and private, 
which is why, at Braskem Idesa and in keeping with our 
comprehensive Sustainability strategy, we decided a 
number of years ago to migrate to a Circular Economy 
model in order to better use our resources and extend 
the lifecycle of our products and packaging as much as 
possible. 
Transitioning to a circular model represents numerous 
challenges in different areas of the plastics industry: 
technology and innovation, best practices and designs, 
infrastructure, and more collaboration strategies 
with our value chain, clients and society in order to 
safeguard natural resources. 
For 3 years now, Braskem Idesa has been a signatory of 
voluntary Circular Economy commitments:
• 100% of the company’s industrial units implement 
best practices to manage pellet creation through 
Operation Zero Pellets to 2021.
• 100% of plastic packaging reused, recycled, or 
recovered by 2040.
We believe that it is important to achieve sustainability 
within society, not only based on isolated actions but also 
through teamwork involving our clients, suppliers, Team 
Members and communities surrounding our complex. 
These activities include product recycling, plastic waste 
collection activities, and educational programs to help 
people become more responsible for the environment. OUR ONGOING 
EFFORTS 
focus on developing  best 
practices  that are aligned 
with the Circular Economy 
model to help safeguard 
natural resources.
As part of the voluntary commitments that we have 
made regarding the Circular Economy, we have defined 
8 fundamental pillars to help us achieve this goal:
1. Working with clients and value chains to drive 
the recycling, efficiency, and reuse of plastics.
2. Continuing to invest in the development of new 
renewable products.
3. Developing technologies and business models to 
improve plastic recovery.
4. Promoting educational programs focusing on 
responsible consumption. 
5. Using and supporting the use of Life Cycle 
Analysis tools.
6. Supporting the measurement and 
communication of recycling indices.
7. Supporting public and private sector alliances to 
better tackle the problem of marine debris.
8. Supporting public policies to improve solid 
waste management. —

the Circular Economy
In keeping with our commitment to migrate to a Circular Economy, we have 
continued to develop our line of Post-Consumer Resin (PCR) Polyethylene 
resins, which guarantee batch quality, standardization, and traceability in 
order to launch a High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) resin on the market 
that is made from 30% PCR and 70% virgin resin, as well as 50% PCR and 
50% virgin resin, and 70% PCR and 30% virgin resin. 
The production process for PCR resin at Braskem Idesa is outlined below:
1. Production of virgin polyethylene resin at the Braskem Idesa 
petrochemical complex.
2. Collection by Alcamare, recycling centers and plastic waste collection 
partners.
3. Classification, cleaning, and extrusion of plastic waste by Alcamare. It is 
then mixed with virgin resin from Braskem Idesa to product the pellets 
of the PCR resin compound and deliver them to clients and distributors.
PrevenirTHE CREATION OF OUR 
PCR RESIN
has enabled us to incorporate 
a recycling process  into our 
operations, expand our sustainable 
portfolio , and give plastic a new 
life and maintain its properties.[103-2, 103-3, 301-1, 301-2, 302-3, 306-1, 306-2] [103-2, 103-3, 306-1, 306-2]

OFFERED BY 
BRASKEM IDESA  
for the manufacturing 
of packaging and 
containers can now be 
found on the shelves of 
self-service stores.
Through a forward-looking approach, Braskem’s 
global commitments to the Circular Economy 
business model are: 
• By 2025, expand the I'm Green Recycled™ 
portfolio, which includes sales of 300,000 
tons of products that contain recycled 
material per year. 
• By 2030, continue expanding the I'm 
Green™ portfolio, which includes sales of 
1,000,000 tons of products that contain 
recycled material per year.
• By 2030, work towards recovering 
1,500,000 tons of plastic waste in order to 
avoid disposal via incineration, landfill or 
dumping. 
Memorandum Of 
Understanding (MOU) with 
Alcamare
Post-Consumer Resins (PCR) made from Polyethylene (PE) and 
Polypropylene (PP) represent a viable option for fulfilling the commitments 
to use recycled materials made by global brand owners, and solutions for 
food products will play a crucial role. 
They are also a solution for complying with legislation in the United States 
and Mexico and focusing on providing incentives for the use of recycled 
materials in packaging. This is why, in collaboration with Alcamare, we 
signed a long-term cooperation agreement to develop food-grade recycled 
material. 
This collaboration agreement represents a significant advance in accessing a 
new select market for high-quality recycled materials that will complement 
the virgin products produced by Braskem Idesa. This sector will see a rapid 
growth rate, almost three times that of virgin resins.
Recycled products require major investments in technology in order to be 
able to properly separate, wash, extrude and decontaminate plastic waste 
to reach the level of purity required. We expect that the use of these resins 
will help create attractive solutions for producers and consumers.
"THIS COLLABORATION 
PLAYS AN IMPORTANT 
role in allowing us to continue offering 
the solutions  that our clients and 
brand owners need, in addition to 
helping Alcamare and Braskem Idesa 
reaffirm their visions, purposes and 
technological development".

PERFORMANCEPartnerships to Drive the 
Circular Economy
In August 2021, we consolidated our partnership with 
Genomma Lab and with Citrulsa, a plastic processer in 
Mexico, to help make our value chain more responsible 
by using polyethylene resin that contains 30% recycled 
material from Braskem Idesa to make containers 
for Genomma Lab products, in addition to helping 
streamline the use of fossil resources and promote 
recycling.
Together, we have joined our strengths and capabilities 
together to create a vision of sustainability and 
contribute to the Circular Economy, sharing principles 
and developing solutions to tackle current environmental 
challenges, such as a lack of resources, adequate plastic 
waste management, and climate change.
As part of this partnership, Citrulsa, one of Genomma 
Lab’s suppliers, has incorporated PCR resin developed 
by Braskem Idesa into the polyethylene containers it 
supplies to Genomma Lab for brands including Vanart® , 
Alert® , Cicatricure® , Goicoechea® , Silka® , Teatrical® , 
among others.This partnership will enable Genomma Lab to remain 
a step ahead and reach the goals of its 2025 Global 
Sustainability strategy – specifically in the area of 
Our Products, meeting its commitment to integrating 
recycled resin into its current portfolio of products and 
future launches.
Educational Programs 
that Promote Responsible 
Consumption and Recycling
As part of our Social Responsibility efforts, at Braskem 
Idesa we have developed programs that promote 
education about how to identify plastics, drive 
responsible consumption and proper waste separation, 
and promote a culture of recycling and the Circular 
Economy within society. 
These actions help take full advantage of the lifecycle 
of plastic and drive social changes regarding post-
consumer waste management. Our overarching goal is 
to help avoid plastic waste being incorrectly disposed of 
and fulfil our commitments to the Circular Economy.  
Promoting infrastructure to drive plastic collection and 
recycling alongside our clients, brand owners, Team 
Members and society is how we can help drive change 
through small actions. "BRASKEM IDESA
PROVIDES THE 
Mexican market with high-
quality solutions for high-
performance applications, 
using an increasingly higher 
percentage of post-consumer 
recycled content, both in 
terms of polyethylene and 
polypropylene.”

Commercial Director.TEAMWORK HAS 
ALLOWED US 
to achieve great things  
and drive more projects 
relating to the Circular 
Economy.
PLASTIANGUIS
At Braskem Idesa, we adopted this program created 
by the Mexican Association of the Chemical Industry 
(ANIQ) in 2017 , which focuses on supporting education 
through responsible consumption, recycling, and 
plastic processing by creating infrastructure for 
collecting plastic waste, which can then be exchanged 
for basic food products or school supplies.  
Despite the pandemic, we successfully coordinated 
this program while complying with the health 
measures rolled out by the authorities. The milestones 
we reached as part of the Plastianguis program in 
2021 are outlined below:
• 15,000 people benefitted.
• 3 locations:  Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM in 
CDMX, Nanchital in Veracruz, and the Autonomous 
University of Guadalajara (UAG). 
• Brand owners, clients, distributors, and 
participating NGO’s.
IN 2021, 
we rolled out the 
first program in 
Guadalajara,  while 
this annual program is 
already well established 
in Veracruz and CDMX.

PERFORMANCEPRODUCT LIFE 
CYCLE
Monitoring and mitigating environmental impacts play a 
fundamental role in both our Sustainability Strategy and 
our Circular Economy, which is why we use tools such as 
Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) to analyze our products. This 
analysis encompasses all our processes - from the value 
chain and the extraction of the raw materials to final 
disposal - in order to corroborate the benefits that our 
solutions have on sustainable development.
In 2021, we undertook the Environmental and Social Life 
Cycle Analysis of our High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) 
with Post-Consumer Resin (PCR), which is of fundamental 
importance in measuring the potential impacts that 
the production of recycled plastic resin has on the 
environment, from the outset to the manufacturing of 1 
kg of PCR resin.
LCA methodology uses comparisons regarding 
environmental performance and average consumption 
of 100% virgin polyethylene resin in Mexico, in addition 
to including its social  impact through a Social Life 
Cycle Analysis based on ISO:14040 (NMX-SAA-14040-
IMNC-2008), ISO 14044 (NMX-SAA-14044-IMNC-2008) 
PNEMU SETAC 2013 for Social LCA, and PNEMU Social 
LCA Guidelines for Products and Organizations.
The major results of the LCA are outlined below:
Social Aspects: 
As part of the Social LCA, which assessed the performance 
of Braskem Idesa, Alcamare and its social waste collection 
centers, they achieved a high performance rating, in 
addition to documenting good practices in the categories 
of health, safety, community, the eradication of child labor, 
economic development, and community commitment. Climate Change Potential: (PCG)(kg CO2eq 
/ kg LDPE resin) assessed using the Circular 
Footprint Formula (CFF)

by the Team Member. Our directors also have access to 
a stock purchase program. 
In 2021, we kept our remote working model in place 
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritizing the 
health of our Team Members. In 2022, we will be rolling 
out a new hybrid working model (remote and in-person 
working), which will allow us to offer new work models. 
Furthermore, and in order to safeguard and support 
the families of our Team Members, we offer a range 
of different benefits, including childcare support 
and maternity programs that include 21 calendar 
days of paid leave and 7 calendar days of a reduced 
work schedule for our female Team Members. When 
they return to work, we also offer 5 working days of 
paid paternity leave, which is in addition to the leave 
stipulated in the Federal Labor Act (this also includes 
paternity leave as a result of adoption).
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
At Braskem Idesa, we are committed to the development and well-being of our 
Team Members, driving measures that ensure good relationships, impeccable 
behavior, and, above all, a healthy work environment, all governed by our Code of 
Conduct. 
Furthermore, in terms of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, we raise awareness 
among and offer training to our Team Members through podcasts, workshops 
and activations, such as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Week or our Recruitment 
Fair for people with disabilities, in addition to our DEI approach to the induction 
processes for new Team Members and our recruitment and selection process. 
PrevenirAT BRASKEM IDESA, 11% OF DIRECTORS
28.13% of managers and 34.43% of coordinators 
are women.
In terms of pay, our performance assessment system uses 
quantitative and qualitative methods that categorize positions 
using four factors: Skills, Problem Solving, Responsibility, and 
Working Conditions. 
Another element that we deem to be relevant in helping to 
promote diversity and inclusion are people with disabilities, which 
is why, during 2021, we included a front desk service to underpin our 
efforts to increase the number of people with disabilities within the 
workforce, in addition to promoting among our service providers 
the inclusion of people with disabilities in their workforces, while 
taking into consideration that the post does not pose any risk to 
their health and safety. 
IN 2021
we hired 1 person with a 
disability through our front 
desk service.

This Program began in 2012 to promote dialog with the communities surrounding our 
petrochemical complex. Biannual meetings were organized when we began operations, and, 
as of 2016, they are now held annually. During 2021, and in order to stay connected with these 
communities, we organized online meetings, in addition to in-person visits with local government 
officials and community leaders.
DURING 2021, WE HAD 
1,200 interactions with people from the community.
The Braskem Idesa Experience – Community Visit to our 
Petrochemical Complex
As part of our stakeholder engagement strategy, we have organized virtual tours of our 
Petrochemical Complex for people, NGOs, or other companies in order to offer them the 
opportunity to learn more about our facilities, operations, Team Members and safety protocols.
During 2020 and at the beginning of 2021, as a result of the public health crisis, we stayed 
connected with people using technology to create a virtual tour video that could be shared via 
WhatsApp.

and early detection of breast cancer, we offered 
a series of talks and workshops for women in the 
communities of Pollo de Oro, Nahualapa and Lázaro 
Cárdenas, in collaboration with the health authorities 
in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. We also coordinated 100 
mammograms.
Deworming and Vitamin Campaign
In July, we began the first community health campaign, 
focusing on providing deworming and vitamin tablets 
to help 600 people in the communities of Pollo de 
Oro, Nahualapa and Lázaro Cárdenas. Members of 
the communities gathered at their respective health 
centers for an informative talk about the importance 
of this campaign before being given vitamins to help 
boost their immune systems.
Safe School
We trained students and teachers from 6 schools located 
in the communities of Pollo de Oro, Nahualapa and 
Lázaro Cárdenas regarding the Emergency Response 
Plan (Drills, Evacuation and Risk Identification within 
Schools, in addition to Emergency Response). We were 
supported by the Braskem Idesa Emergency Team and 
the local Civil Protection services.
Community Brigade Training
In August, we held our first induction sessions for 
the three Community Brigade groups from the 
communities of Pollo de Oro, Nahualapa and Lázaro 
Cárdenas, creating groups to receive training in 
emergency response in order to support their 
respective communities. This session was coordinated

of Pollo de Oro, Nahualapa and Lázaro Cárdenas organized cleaning 
activities to prevent and minimize factors that encourage the 
reproduction of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which transmits the 
Dengue virus. During community work sessions, common areas and 
busy streets were also fumigated.
Doctor on Call Program 
In 2021, we held 4 sessions of the Doctor on Call program, offering 
medical appointments via videoconference in the communities 
of Pollo de Oro, Nahualapa, Lázaro Cárdenas and Los Coquitos, 
benefiting 24 patients. Healthcare workers from each community 
treated the patients one by one, checking their vital signs, weight, 
height and temperature before they had their remote appointment 
with the doctor. After each appointment, patients were given the 
medicine prescribed by the doctor. 
This activity is held once a month, ensuring on-going monitoring and 
medical support for people in the community.

promote education and environmental conservation, 
during 2021 we focused on the following infrastructure 
projects:
Dome Construction at Emiliano Zapata 
Elementary School located in the 
community of Ejido Lázaro Cárdenas:

a dome at the Emiliano Zapata elementary school 
located in the community of Ejido Lázaro Cárdenas. 
This infrastructure project benefits communities 
surrounding the plant by creating a space where 
students can safely focus on their activities and 
development.
Plastired Project: 
This project focuses on providing internet access 
for educational, health or work purposes through an 
approach that encompasses both co-responsibility 
and internal guidelines. The fee for using this service is 
to donate 3 High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) bottle 
caps. The infrastructure installed includes:160 CHILDREN  
benefitted through the Plastired 
program.
• Wireless modem with good signal.
• Plastic collection cylinder for HDPE bottle caps.
• Log for users to record their information and the 
amount of time they used the internet.
• Poster containing the rules and brief instructions 
on how to connect to the internet.
Prior to the launch of the program, we surveyed 
community members in order to find the ideal location 
to install this equipment. Schools from the three 
communities were chosen, and they are responsible 
for caring for and monitoring the equipment to ensure 
that it is kept in good working conditions, in addition 
to enforcing proper social distancing and hygiene 
measures. [413-1]

Braskem Idesa   2021 Sustainability ReportTeam Member Health and Safety
At Braskem Idesa, providing a safe environment and 
on-going communication to our Team Members 
and our contractors is of fundamental importance, 
which is why, from the beginning of the pandemic, we 
established prevention protocols.
We began by creating a senior management committee 
tasked with monitoring the situation and the Health 
Brigades on a daily basis and supervising compliance 
with the prevention measures in place at our facilities. 
We also rolled out the infrastructure necessary to 
quickly ensure that more than 50% of our Team 
Members from both our complex and corporate office 
could start working from home.
PrevenirAT BRASKEM IDESA 
we made no direct or indirect 
reductions to our workforce, and 
we kept on 100% of the members 
of the communities within our 
area of social influence and 
suppliers.
During 2021, we maintained the following prevention 
measures: 
1. Access Control 
At all access points to the petrochemical complex 
and corporate offices we installed filters that included 
thermal imaging cameras, temperature stations, 64 
sanitizing gel stations, disinfectant mats, and social 
distancing and PPE protocols. Furthermore, we rolled out daily health questionnaires 
for all Team Members, visitors and contractors, created 
attendance lists, and carried out rapid COVID-19 
testing to help decrease the risk of infection.
OUR RISK 
prevention measures have 
covered more than 11,953 Team 
Members, contractors and 
visitors during 2021.
2. Employee Transport
We rolled out transport routes to guarantee and 
safeguard the health of our Team Members on 
entering or leaving the complex, limiting maximum 
vehicle occupancy to 40%, using only window seats to 
maintain maximum distance, ensuring all vehicles are 
sanitized on a daily basis, and making hand sanitizer 
available for Team Members.
On boarding the employee transport, the temperature 
of each passenger is taken, all Team Members must 
wear facemasks, and social distancing (1.5 m) must be 
observed when queuing for the bus.  
DURING 2021 
transportation services were 
offered to 768 Team Members 
and 465 contractors.
3. Social Distancing and Health Brigade
In compliance with public health recommendations issued by the Mexican 
authorities, we rolled out actions to ensure social distancing in cafeterias, canteens, 
reception areas, conference rooms and the auditorium, limiting occupancy to 
40%, installing barriers, posting social distancing reminders, and redistributing and 
optimizing spaces to help avoid or mitigate infections among Team Members and 
contractors.
In addition to these social distancing measures, we created a Health Brigade 
comprising security personnel to ensure compliance with the measures 
implemented. This brigade filed a daily report outlining any incidents that occurred 
during the day.
THE HEALTH BRIGADE   
helped us to prevent compliance issues with 
the public health measures implemented at the 
complex.
4. Cleaning and Disinfection
We have crews that are tasked with cleaning and disinfecting common 
areas, vehicles, access points, workspaces, and major points of contact 
on a daily basis. In order to ensure proper sanitization, a diluted solution 
of chlorine or a nebulizer with DERM-O-QUAT-PLUS are used, both 
of which are recommended by public health authorities and Braskem 
Idesa’s medical service.
For our contractors, we sanitize the areas to which they 
have access, such as offices, workshops and vehicles, and 
we have also set up disinfection stations equipped with 
disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer. —

STANDARDSAt Braskem Idesa, driving innovation and being at the 
cutting edge are part of our business DNA. Given the 
changes that have taken place in recent years through 
the renewal of the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SD), and in keeping with the new 2020-2030 Agenda, 
we have decided to focus our efforts on how best to 
contribute to achieving these goals. 
The first major change was to shift from 10 to 7 Macro 
Sustainable Development Goals, a process that involved 
more than 500 global leaders and Team Members from 
Braskem Brazil, United States, Europe and Braskem 
Idesa in Mexico to define these commitments.
From September 2020, these redefined commitments 
were included in our Global Sustainable Development 
Strategy by the Board of Directors as the result of a 
materiality study, a business risk management analysis 
covering the value chain and society in general, and 
the consideration of the elements of sustainable 
development: economic, social and environmental. 
We have reaffirmed our commitment to sustainability 
through these guidelines, which are helping to create 
projects focusing on the Circular Economy and Carbon 
Neutrality in order for us, in conjunction with our 
stakeholders, to build a more sustainable future.
Our comprehensive sustainability strategy is 
aligned with the UN’s 2030 Agenda, the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG) and the Paris Agreement on 
Climate Change.

Greenhouse Gas 
EmissionsDiscussion of long-term and 
short-term strategy or plan 
to manage Scope 1 emissions, 
emissions reduction targets, 
and an analysis of performance 
against those targetsN/A1. Short- and Long- Term Strategy Analysis:
As part of our strategy, we comply with all regulations issued by the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources
(SEMARNAT) and the Department of Energy (SENER), in addition to the Material and Energy Balance Methodology,
monitoring all emissions stemming from our operations.
We are also governed by a Global Development Policy that encompasses 7 Macro Sustainability goals, including climate
change, operational efficiency, and actions and goals to help mitigate, reduce or capture GHG.
The Greenhouse Gas Legal Framework we follow encompasses the following:
• Climate Change Act, Regulations of the Climate Change Act for the National Emissions Registry (RENE), GHG Report for Annual 
Operating Cell (COA), GHG Calculation Methodologies, CO2  Emission Direct Measurement Methodology.
• Annual GHG emissions reports and verification for the National Emissions Registry (RENE).
• Emissions Trading System Program (SCE).
2. Emission Reduction Goals
Based on the Climate Change Act, the overall contribution to reducing GHG emissions from the chemical and petrochemical 
industry stands at 5% by 2030.
As Braskem Idesa, our goal lies in: 1) Identifying projects to reduce, mitigate or capture CO2; 2) Driving energy efficiency in our 
operations; 3) Consolidating waste management; 4) Identifying renewable energies; 5) Participating in Emissions Trading; 6) 
Assessing the acquisition of an Energy Efficiency Certificate for the petrochemical complex. 
Additionally, Grupo Braskem has made a public global commitment through its operations in Brazil, the United States, Europe 
and Mexico to reduce GHG emissions by 15% before 2030, in addition to becoming carbon neutral by 2050.
3. Analysis of results vs. goals
Regarding emissions by gas type in our operations, there was a decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of the following 
actions: 
1) Equipment maintenance, the use of natural gas instead of ethane gas for energy generation, and operational efficiency 
stemming from the cutting-edge technology employed at the complex
We measure our air emissions by type of gas, considering NOx, SOx, VOC, CO2, CH4, HFC, PM and other categories such as Cr.
2) Emission reduction targets
3)Analysis of the results in relation to objectives[102-12] [102-12]

Standards (ND) of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), as well as the Recommendations about Common Approaches 
to the Environment (AE) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and with the Operational 
Directives (OD) of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). 
We voluntarily assume the national regulations on a Socially Responsible Company SCR by Centro Mexicano de la Filantropía 
(CEMEFI), where the behaviour of the organization based on values is evaluated, and the commitment to address the impact 
of the activities and decisions of its stakeholders, to maintain the social license to operate. Likewise, Braskem Idesa has a 
management program that has been implemented since the beginning of construction in 2011 and that has been evolving 
based on the needs of the business and the interested parties.
The means by which Braskem Idesa addresses risks and impacts about stakeholders are:
The grievance and complaint mechanism, with different communication channels: mailbox, telephone, visits to communities 
and community mail, quejascomunitarias@braskem.com,
In addition to the different engagement forums, the social traffic light is updated where possible risks are identified, official 
notices of an event, crisis committee, use of Braskem Idesa’s social networks.
With other organizations we have: health committees, meetings with municipal authorities, a local mutual aid committee to talk 
with companies in the region on safety issues and good practices.
