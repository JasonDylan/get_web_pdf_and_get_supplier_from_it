During fiscal year 2018, Conagra Brands continued 
its journey of transformation. We continued to focus 
on being a pure-play branded food company for 
the first time in our organization’s nearly 100-year 
history. We continued modernizing our portfolio 
of iconic brands through innovation and M&A. 
And we delivered on our financial commitments to 
investors. At the same time, we stayed true to our 
unwavering commitment to a core value here at 
the company—Integrity. By doing the right things, 
and doing them right, we will continue to deliver 
meaningful and sustainable success for all.
And that’s why our Corporate Social Responsibility 
work is so important at Conagra. CSR is more than  
a collection of initiatives. At Conagra, we believe that 
when our people, communities and the environment 
are thriving, so are we. Great food and great results are natural outcomes of a strategy that starts 
with the question—what’s the right thing to do?
To ensure that our CSR work is fed into  
strategic decision-making at the highest levels  
of the organization, we leverage our Board of 
Directors and senior executives in the effort.  
Our Board’s Nominating, Governance and Public 
Affairs Committee reviews our CSR journey.  
And, on a more day-to-day basis, we utilize a  
multi-functional CSR Steering Committee led  
by several of our senior executives—direct  
reports of mine. The committee discusses the 
economic, environmental and social impacts of 
our operations and identifies opportunities to drive 
positive impact throughout the organization.  
The committee also leverages team members from 
across Conagra, with sub-committees aligned to 
our four CSR pillars—Good Food, Responsible 
Sourcing, Stronger Communities and Better 
Planet. By accessing diverse talent across our 
organization, we can find real areas for impact.
And I am incredibly proud of Conagra’s positive 
CSR impact. Over the last several years, we 
have become deliberate about incorporating 
more sustainable attributes into our products—
refreshing ingredients, production processes and 
packaging. We have also continued to generate 
innovative methods for saving energy, water and 
waste in our operations through our Sustainable Development Awards program. In addition, 
employee-centric activities like our Month of Service 
have resulted in meaningful community impact.
Excitingly, we have a tremendous opportunity to 
keep getting better. Our core operations serve as 
fertile hunting ground for continued improvement. 
In addition, recent acquisitions, like fiscal year 2018 
purchases of Angie’s BOOMCHICKAPOP!® and 
Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin,® and the more  
recent, sizable, October 2018 purchase of  
Pinnacle Foods Inc., create a bounty of opportunity. 
Finding efficiency, adding more than you take, 
contributing positively to the community—these 
aren’t easy tasks for any company. However, 
we know that all our stakeholders, including our 
consumers, employees and investors, are watching. 
We are pleased to present this report to share 
details of our progress and our goals for the future. 
 
At Conagra, we will continue to do the right things. 
 
Thank you for your interest, and trust.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Our Approach to Citizenship
Conagra Brands’ citizenship strategy was developed 
by our CSR Steering Committee, a cross-functional 
team that includes leaders and subject matter 
experts in key functional areas related to our 
four citizenship pillars: Good Food, Responsible 
Sourcing, Better Planet and Stronger Communities. 
The CSR Steering Committee is led by members  
of our Senior Leadership Team responsible for 
Conagra Brands’ operations, procurement, human 
resources, stakeholder communications and 
corporate reputation. During fiscal year 2018, we 
formed four sub-committees within the CSR Steering 
Committee. Each sub-committee has responsibility 
for managing a specific citizenship pillar and the 
spectrum of material topics that fall within that focus 
area. The new sub-committees are helping us focus
financial and employee resources in a targeted  
way and support future goal-setting and progress. 
Conagra Brands’ senior leadership team holds 
ultimate responsibility for implementing our 
citizenship strategy, with oversight from the 
Nominating, Governance and Public Affairs 
Committee of our Board of Directors (“Governance 
Committee”). At least annually, the Governance 
Committee reviews Conagra Brands’ policies 
and programs related to corporate citizenship. 
The Governance Committee also regularly meets 
with management to discuss internal and external 
factors affecting our Company’s image and 
reputation, including those related to corporate 
citizenship. The Governance Committee is 
comprised entirely of independent directors (as 
defined by the NYSE independence requirements).Though citizenship is managed through the 
described governance structure, everyone 
at Conagra Brands plays a role. Our 17,000 
passionate employees bring corporate citizenship 
to life for us and for everyone affected by our 
business. Employees across all functions of our 
company—from research & development to risk 
management, sustainability, brands/marketing, 
insights, procurement and operations—provide 
the passion and innovation to embed corporate 
citizenship into the fabric of Conagra Brands and achieve our citizenship ambitions. Their enthusiasm, 
dedication and collaboration enable us to manage 
risks and leverage opportunities—so that we 
do the right things and do things right. Whether 
volunteering in our communities, participating 
in our facilities’ green teams, or collaborating 
on programs and projects, our employees truly 
define us as a responsible corporate citizen.EmployeesCSR Steering Committee

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Citizenship Philosophy and Focus Areas 
The people of Conagra Brands make everyday food in extraordinary ways and with unwavering attention to our citizenship ambitions.  
This means making food that’s delicious, safe, nutritious and convenient, while addressing the key economic, environmental and social  
impacts directly linked to our activities and products, such as through business relationships with farmers, suppliers, customers and others. 
Our citizenship strategy includes four focus areas: Good Food, Responsible Sourcing, Better Planet and Stronger Communities.  
Together, these strategic pillars articulate our values and ambitions as a responsible corporate citizen. We look forward to making good  
food for generations to come, and doing so in a way that supports responsible sourcing, stronger communities and a better planet.
Good Food
We continuously strive to make safe, delicious, affordable 
and nutritious foods, while providing the information that 
consumers need to make educated food choices.
Responsible Sourcing
Responsible sourcing of ingredients and packaging materials is about 
more than cost and quality. We also consider the environmental, 
social and economic impacts across our value chain. Better Planet
The health of the planet and availability of natural resources are intricately 
linked to every part of our business. We’re especially focused on taking action 
on climate change, preserving water resources, and eliminating waste.
Stronger Communities
Creating shared value with our community of employees, investors, 
suppliers and business partners—as well as with those who live in 
places where we operate—is critical to our long-term success.

In 2017, we refreshed our materiality analysis to 
reflect current business strategy and stakeholder 
dialogues on relevant environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) topics. Our materiality 
matrix identifies 21 topics across four strategic 
pillars: Better Planet, Good Food, Responsible 
Sourcing and Stronger Communities. Our Citizenship strategy is deeply rooted in this 
holistic and objective view into what issues matter 
most, with an eye on how our activities impact 
global efforts to reach the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals. The 17 UN Sustainable 
Development Goals address challenges such 
as access to food, inequality, climate change, water scarcity, and community empowerment, 
and intersect with Conagra Brands material 
issues, goals and ESG management strategies. 
Daily management of Conagra Brands’ material 
topics is led by our CSR Steering Committee.

Understanding the impact of our business throughout the life cycle of the food we make is critical to developing a comprehensive approach to citizenship. 
This view offers insight into where issues matter most, while also helping to prioritize where we need to influence performance outside of our direct 
control. For example, by collaborating with farmers, suppliers, contract manufacturers and outside transportation networks, we are developing innovative 
ways to improve supply chain efficiency, while providing greater value to our customers and more sustainable products to our consumers.

Contents     Overview     Good Food     Responsible Sourcing      Better Planet     Stronger Communities     About this ReportFood Safety & Quality
Food safety and quality are the most critical issues 
for our industry. When people are enjoying food—
at home or away—they do not question whether 
it is safe to eat. Yet, every year, approximately 
48 million Americans—1 in 6—get sick from 
eating contaminated food, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Of that number, 130,000 are hospitalized 
with foodborne illnesses, and 3,000 die. 
As a consumer foods company and commercial 
foodservice supplier, we recognize that consumers 
are susceptible to any form of food contamination 
that might occur before, during or after the 
manufacturing process. Many consumers also rely 
on manufacturing and processing standards to 
know what ingredients are present in foods due 
to their personal diets, nutritional requirements, 
or medical conditions. Therefore, we have an 
unwavering commitment to food safety and 
quality, which is of utmost importance to all of us 
at Conagra Brands and to all of our stakeholders.
In the rare event that our food does not meet our 
high standards for regulatory compliance, quality 
assurance or food safety, we take marketplace 
action as necessary. In fiscal year 2018, we 
had two product recalls; with one resulting 
in a very limited number of minor injuries.
 Our Management Approach 
Conagra Brands believes food safety and quality 
must be addressed at every step in our value 
chain, from farm to fork. We have rigorous food 
safety and quality policies and procedures 
that ensure the efficiency and effectiveness 
of our ingredient sourcing, food preparation 
and delivery to customers. Our policies and 
procedures cover everything from how our 
employees inspect ingredients as they arrive at 
our facilities, to sanitation of our kitchens and 
preparation lines, to what temperature our food 
should be stored at as it leaves our facilities for 
delivery to our customers and consumers.
Our Food Safety & Quality teams are responsible 
for managing the integrity of our food—beginning 
with sourcing ingredients and all the way through 
preparation and delivery to our customers and 
consumers. These teams are comprised of subject 
matter experts who provide functional leadership 
on all matters related to food safety and quality, 
including:  
 Food safety and quality in 
production and distribution 
 Supplier food safety and quality 
 Consumer affairs 
 Sanitation 
 Allergens 
 Microbiology, Toxicology, and Chemistry 
 Thermal processing 
 Religious certification (Kosher, Halal) 
 Engineering 
 Foreign material contamination 
 Auditing In addition to employing subject matter experts, 
we also engage outside experts to help ensure 
that our food safety and quality programs are 
world-class. We have a Food Safety Council, 
which provides ongoing input and advice on new 
and emerging food safety practices. The Council’s 
members are recognized in the industry for 
their expertise in specific food safety disciplines 
such as food science, microbiology, toxicology, 
epidemiology, microbial physiology, public health 
and public policy. In addition, we periodically engage 
independent consultants to evaluate our policies 
and procedures related to food safety and quality.
The many experts who support our commitment to 
food safety and quality (both within and outside our 
Company) are only part of our program. We also 
rely on the many employees outside of our Food 
Safety & Quality teams. We insist that everyone at 
Conagra Brands is responsible for safety and quality, 
regardless of job function or title. The commitment 
to safety and quality is, in fact, embedded in our 
culture and everything we do every day. Employees 
who have concerns are actively encouraged 
to report them through our ethics hotline. 
Additionally, as leaders in food safety, we have 
embraced the Food Safety Modernization Act 
(FSMA), and look forward to working with the FDA 
as this important law continues to be implemented.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018The Safety and Quality 
of Our Food
As both a consumer foods company and 
commercial foodservice supplier, Conagra Brands 
is uniquely positioned to affect food safety and 
quality on a broad scale. We are committed to 
ensuring that our food is safe to eat and the 
ingredients are of good quality. We do this by 
implementing what we believe to be best-in-class 
processes in our facilities and by working with 
suppliers to ensure a trusted supply of ingredients. 
We supply numerous foodservice outlets, retailers 
and food processors with menu offerings and 
ingredients. As a supplier to the food industry 
ourselves, we’re able to leverage our experiences 
to educate and improve our relationships with 
our own suppliers. Though our business models 
are different, our commitment to ensuring food 
safety and quality is consistent and unwavering.  
 Research, Development  
& Product Innovation  
To design food safety and quality elements into 
new foods and packaging, we conduct extensive 
research and testing, including validation of 
preparation and microwave cooking instructions. 
Our packaging is designed, tested and continually 
re-evaluated to ensure that it performs as 
intended to maintain the wholesomeness, 
quality, integrity and safety of the food.  
 
Ingredient Sourcing & Procurement 
We have internal supplier quality and auditing teams 
that work closely with our suppliers. We require 
our suppliers to use an accredited certification 
body to audit against Global Food Safety Initiative 
(GFSI) standards annually. 70 percent of our 
direct suppliers have completed GFSI-recognized 
certification, which encompasses environmental 
risks. In addition, we measure and monitor our 
top 80 percent of direct materials spend suppliers 
on a quarterly basis for environmental impacts.  
 Manufacturing & Production  
To meet high standards for food safety and 
quality, we continually invest in new equipment 
and technology for our facilities. We also 
proactively identify opportunities for continuous 
performance improvement through our internal 
Food Safety and Quality audit program and 
our “zero-defects” culture. We implement root-
cause solutions and develop employee skills 
to minimize food safety and quality risks.  
 
Transportation, Warehousing 
& Distribution  
We ensure the safety and quality of our 
food by monitoring temperature and 
packaging integrity throughout the storage, 
transportation and distribution stages.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Enhancing Safety & Quality Through Strategic Sourcing 
Conagra Brands believes that collaborative 
relationships with our strategic suppliers make 
our business stronger. Our supplier partnerships 
enhance our own food safety programs and also 
enhance food safety throughout our supply chain, 
while positively impacting the industry as a whole. 
Our comprehensive supplier quality program is 
an integral part of our procurement strategy. We 
only buy and use ingredients that comply with 
applicable regulatory requirements for food safety. 
We also expect suppliers to meet additional 
quality requirements that reflect best practices and 
internationally recognized food safety management 
system standards. We rely on our internal audit 
team and accredited certification bodies to audit 
our suppliers on an annual basis, including auditing 
them against Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI)-
recognized certification programs. For any issue 
identified during an audit, we follow up by approving 
and confirming implementation of corrective 
actions. Our internal audit team conducted 166 total 
facility audits in fiscal year 2018, encompassing 
Company facilities, co-manufacturers, and 
both domestic and international suppliers. 
 Food Safety Audit and Certification Programs 
At Conagra Brands, we strive to be the best, 
and doing so requires both internal and external 
validation of our work. Our robust internal food 
safety audit program is a reflection of our continuous 
improvement culture, driving us to always raise the 
bar. Responsible for being our toughest critic, our 
internal Food Safety & Quality teams proactively 
identify food safety and quality enhancement 
opportunities at our facilities. Our internal auditors 
do this by routinely visiting our facilities, suppliers 
and co-manufacturers to observe worker behaviors 
and ask questions about their processes.  
 In addition, it is required of all suppliers to have 
certification from independent third-party auditors 
according to internationally recognized food safety 
and quality standards. As one of the first U.S. 
companies to align with the Global Food Safety 
Initiative (GFSI), Conagra Brands has aggressively 
pursued certification to GFSI-recognized certification 
programs. Several food safety certification 
programs have been developed and approved by 
GFSI. We have achieved certification through two 
of those programs (SQF and BRC), depending 
on a particular facility’s business segment. When 
facilities earn SQF or BRC certification, it means 
they have enhanced their food safety and quality 
systems, driving better business results. 
THE MOST CRITICAL INGREDIENT IN FOOD SAFETY 
The success of any food safety program depends on people. Our employees are trained 
extensively on safe food-handling practices and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) 
to prevent contamination, mixups and errors that might lead to foodborne illness. These 
practices include hand washing, appropriate footwear and clothing, and proper hairnet use. 
In addition, our sanitation employees are highly trained to thoroughly clean our kitchens 
and preparation lines. We dedicate a significant amount of time, resources and expertise 
to ensure our food is prepared in a clean and consistently controlled environment.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Nutrition
Nutrition continues to be one of the most 
fundamental attributes of food, and a critical 
issue for nearly all of our stakeholders, most 
notably our consumers, customers, public policy 
makers, regulators, investors, public health 
advocates, and non-governmental organizations. 
Research shows that consumers are increasingly 
thinking differently about food and their relationship 
with food. Many are now defining nutrition both 
expansively and holistically. It is no longer enough 
that foods claim to provide specific “good for you” 
vitamins, protein, fiber and other key nutrients. 
Consumers want products that contain whole food 
ingredients that they trust will help them meet their 
goals for health and wellness. In addition, they 
want foods that are authentic, reflect their values, 
and align them with a social circle, or community. 
Consumer food choices often reflect their 
philosophies about food, such as seeking physical 
benefits from fewer refined carbohydrates, placing 
value on simple and natural foods, or choosing 
environmentally responsible protein, for example. Our Management Approach 
Our Research and Development organization is 
responsible for product development, including 
delivering against nutrition and ingredient 
improvement objectives. Within this group, our 
director of nutrition leads the development and 
implementation of strategic nutrition, health 
and wellness planning. We invest in research, 
and engage with the nutrition community, to 
further our understanding of nutrition, and 
use our internal nutrition education program 
(the Conagra Brands Nutrition University) to 
deliberately link nutrition, health and wellness 
within our product innovation process.
Progress and results are shared regularly with 
our senior leaders and with an external Scientific 
Advisory Council. The advisory council was formed 
in 2006, and is composed of leaders from research 
and academic institutions. These experts share their 
perspectives and knowledge to guide our strategy, 
actions and positions on nutrition-related issues.
Though the importance of nutrition has not changed, 
how we think about nutrition has changed, as 
Conagra Brands continuously evolves to deliver 
foods with nutrition benefits that will delight 
consumers. Historically, nutrition benefits have 
been conveyed to consumers through claims 
and nutritional facts that are informative, but 
perhaps not motivating due to clinical or chemical 
connotations. While sound nutrition principles 
remain fundamental and foundational to our foods, 
we have shifted from a nutrient and calorie focus 
to a “food-first” philosophy, where the whole and recognizable food is the hero that conveys the 
nutritional benefits and other health benefits.  
This food-first philosophy is reflected in our 
management approach. We focus on the foods 
and ingredients—providing consumers with foods 
and ingredients that they trust to support their 
health and wellness goals—instead of focusing 
on specific nutrient reductions and increases. 
Our management approach is also driven by 
public health priorities. Our diverse product 
portfolio reflects the various food philosophies of 
consumers, while also serving to advance public 
health priorities. For this reason, our product 
portfolio remains strongly anchored by three 
major attributes: portion and calorie control, 
whole grains and vegetables, and heart health. 
Combined, foods with these attributes comprise 
approximately two thirds of our portfolio. 
The nutrient density of our portfolio is exemplified 
by the 2018 Access to Nutrition Index (ATNI) U.S. 
Spotlight Index, which rates the 10 largest food 
companies in the U.S. Conagra Brands leads 
the Product Profile ranking, which is based on 
the Health Star Rating nutrient profiling criteria. 
According to the report, Conagra Brands was 
estimated in the Product Profile to generate  
44 percent of 2016 sales from healthy products 
(having a Health Star Rating of 3.5 or more) and 
32 percent from products that meet World Health 
Organization Euro criteria for marketing to children.

Our Healthy Choice® brand exemplifies our new 
food-first approach to Nutrition. Since its inception 
30 years ago, it is one of few major brands, if not 
the only major brand, that has stayed relevant 
to consumers while being specifically focused 
on health, consistent with the FDA’s current 
definition of “healthy” and consistent with evolving 
expectations around nutrition, health and wellness.
First introduced in fiscal year 2018, our Healthy 
Choice Power Bowls line features bold flavors and 
an intentional balance of ingredients that align 
with consumer’s current attitudes towards healthy, 
nutritious food. Each ingredient is thoughtfully 
selected to provide inspired, on-trend flavors with 
unique nutrient-dense vegetables and whole grains.
THE FDA STARTED A PUBLIC PROCESS 
IN 2016 , to revisit the healthy nutrient content 
claim on food labels, as part of an overall plan 
to enable consumers to easily and quickly 
make food choices consistent with public 
health recommendations and to encourage the 
development of healthier foods by the food 
industry. We have taken a leadership role in the 
FDA’s process, by providing public comments 
and other support to advance the conversation 
and regulatory framework. It is our goal to 
continue to advance definitions of “healthy” 
foods, while providing consumers with foods 
that fit both the definition of “healthy” and 
consumers’ evolving philosophies on food.Grains

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Interacting With the Nutrition Community
Health Professionals, such as the approximately 
89,000 registered dietitians in the U.S., are 
important resources for consumers seeking 
credible nutrition, health and wellness information. 
For this reason, we support their continued 
development and ability to translate science-
based information and other complicated concepts 
into practical guidelines and recommendations 
for consumers and other stakeholders. 
We provide health professionals with access to 
all of our educational materials and programs 
on our Conagra Brands Nutrition website, 
conagranutrition.com, which includes 
detailed information about our food and other 
informational resources that health professionals 
can use to assist their clients. The website offers 
information on trending ingredients, recipes, 
fact sheets, and labeling infographics.In addition to our nutrition website, we offer a 
webinar series called Nutri-Bites. Fiscal year 2018 
was our seventh year of running the webinar 
series. Our webinars are presented by renowned 
nutrition experts, and provide the latest thinking on 
relevant nutrition topics to help registered dietitian 
nutritionists to better serve their clients. The 
webinars are free of charge and fully accredited for 
continuing education credits needed to maintain 
professional registration and licensing. In fiscal year 
2018, 93 percent of participants rated the webinars 
as “valuable” or “very valuable,” and we issued more 
than 5,000 units of continuing education credit. 
Since we started our webinars, we have issued more 
than 81,000 units of continuing education credit. We also support third party research to advance 
scientific understanding of effective nutrition 
strategies. For example, we donated Healthy 
Choice® and Marie Callender’s® single serving 
meals for all participants in a large 2018 intervention 
study called Dissemination of the Look AHEAD 
Intensive Lifestyle Intervention in the United 
States Military: A Randomized Controlled Trial 
(Krukowski et al, 2018). The purpose of this study 
was to compare a translation of the Look AHEAD 
(Action for Heath in Diabetes) Intensive Lifestyle 
Intervention with a self-paced version of the same 
intervention among active duty military personnel.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Product Transparency
Increasingly, consumers want to know more about 
what is in the food they eat. Ingredient lists are not 
enough. Nutrition facts labels are not enough. They 
want to know why specific ingredients are used, 
where they came from, and how the ingredients 
(and the nutrients in the ingredients) can impact 
overall health. Food companies like ours need 
to address consumers’ questions through more 
open and transparent communication. We are 
committed to providing access to the information 
consumers want and need to make informed 
decisions about what they eat. All consumers should 
be empowered to make educated food choices.
Our Management Approach 
In response to consumers’ expectations of 
transparency, we are focused on ensuring that 
they can find the information they want quickly 
and easily. Therefore, we work on multiple 
fronts to support access to product information 
where and when consumers want it. This 
includes consumer-friendly nutrition facts labels, 
appropriate ingredient statements and other 
on-pack information, product information on 
our branded websites, direct communications 
via our Consumer Affairs Center, and other 
resources enabled by information technology. 
NUTRITION LABELING 
Labeling our food is an important 
element of our brand-building and 
marketing efforts, and a way that 
we foster transparency. Being 
compliant with all legal and regulatory 
requirements is our first priority. 
All labels go through a rigorous 
review cycle prior to being printed. 
Packaging graphics are reviewed 
by multiple functions, including 
registered dietitians, food labelers, 
nutritionists, food scientists, our 
legal department and marketers. 
In 2016, the FDA issued final rules 
that require manufacturers to use 
a new Nutrition Facts Label. We 
began updating the nutritional panels 
on our packaging immediately. 
The new consumer-friendly format 
is very different than the original 
format. Among other changes, it 
highlights calories and serving sizes 
as important elements for making 
food choices. We anticipate that our 
entire portfolio will reflect the new 
Nutrition Facts Panel some time in 
2019, before the compliance deadline 
for manufacturers of our size, which 
is currently set at January 1, 2020.*

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018SmartLabel™
Conagra Brands proudly participates in the 
SmartLabel program, which was created by a 
joint industry leadership group of the Grocery 
Manufacturers Association (GMA) and the 
Food Marketing Institute (FMI). The program 
is completely voluntary. We participate in it, 
because we want to ensure that our consumers 
can be as informed as possible about our food.
SmartLabel leverages readily-available mobile 
technology to provide consumers with easy access 
to product information—whether in their favorite 
store, at home, at work, or using a smart phone, 
tablet or desktop computer. And, SmartLabel 
lets them view far more details than could ever 
fit on a product’s package label! Consumers can 
view detailed nutritional information, ingredient 
definitions, allergens, certifications such as USDA 
organic and Non-GMO Project Verified, and many 
other product attributes, as well as manufacturer 
information. Each product participating in the 
program has a specific landing page containing 
all of this information. The landing pages are 
organized in a consistent format and appearance 
across different brands and products.
As of the end of fiscal year 2018, we have 
approximately 1700 pages live on smartlabel.
org. This represents more than a fivefold increase 
over last year! We look forward to adding more 
pages each day. Even if some of our products do 
not yet display the SmartLabel QR code on the 
packaging, consumers can still visit smartlabel.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Genetic Modification
Conagra Brands agrees with the FDA and numerous 
trusted scientific bodies and regulatory agencies 
(e.g., World Health Organization, Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 
and Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development) that foods and beverages 
that contain ingredients derived from genetically 
modified organisms (GMOs) are safe and nutritious. 
Given the potential for GMOs to improve the 
quality, sustainable availability and nutritional 
value of food, we support its responsible use 
when based on sound science and appropriate 
regulatory and safety reviews. We stand behind the 
health and safety of all of our products, including 
those with genetically engineered ingredients. 
We recognize that this is an area of evolving public 
perception and opinion and, therefore, offer a 
broad range of products to appeal to a wide range 
of consumers, including consumers that want to 
avoid GMOs in their food. Many of our products, 
such as Hunt’s tomatoes and Alexia vegetables, 
are Non-GMO Project Verified. Going forward, 
we will continue to monitor scientific advances, 
regulatory activity, and the opinions of key trade 
associations, R&D organizations, consumers and 
other stakeholders, to guide our thinking on GMOs.
Disclosure of GMOs is a separate issue—an issue 
of transparency. Conagra Brands welcomes a 
national, uniform approach to disclosure on the use 
of GMOs in food. We fully supported the National 
Bioengineered Food Disclosure Law, which requires 
food companies to include information about GMOs 
on product labels and online. Now that the final 
National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard 
has been issued by the USDA, we intend to comply 
fully by the January 2022 compliance date.Allergen Labeling
A key component of our food safety program 
is carefully managing major food allergens 
practices to prevent cross-contact and to ensure 
that the presence of food allergens in a food is 
communicated clearly to consumers. In fact, 
our allergen management program pre-dates 
the passage of the Food Allergen Labeling and 
Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) in 2004. 
We systematically alert consumers of our products 
about the eight major food allergens. For any 
branded foods that contain one of these allergens, 
we include a plain-language “Contains” statement 
below the ingredient statement. Some of our other 
food packages might feature a precautionary 
“May Contain” statement. We always use Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and thoroughly 
clean our equipment after using allergen-containing 
ingredients. In some cases, however, our efforts might not ensure the absence of a potential allergen 
simply due to the nature of the equipment or 
process. Therefore, we recommend that consumers 
not eat a product, if they are allergic to any of the 
ingredients listed in a “May Contain” statement. 
We further recommend that consumers with food 
allergies always check the ingredient statements 
on our food products at the time of purchase, 
because product formulations may change. 
Gluten (found in certain grains such as wheat) is 
the subject of specific FDA labeling rules. All foods 
bearing a “Gluten Free” claim must contain less than 
20 ppm (parts per million) gluten. Conagra Brands’ 
portfolio includes some foods that bear this claim. 
We use the “Gluten Free” claim on a food only after 
implementing comprehensive testing protocols. Our 
testing program includes reviews of the ingredients, 
the suitability of the facility, and overall product 
composition, to ensure full compliance with the 
FDA’s defined standard for gluten content.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Advertising to Children
Our consumers and customers have come to know 
our brands through a variety of marketing channels, 
including advertisements. We recognize that food 
marketing affects food choices and influences 
dietary habits, especially of vulnerable groups such 
as children. Therefore, we understand the necessity 
of marketing to children in a responsible way.
Conagra Brands has long been a firm proponent 
of responsible marketing to children. Since 
2007, we have participated in the Children’s 
Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative 
(CFBAI) of the Council of Better Business 
Bureaus, a voluntary industry self-regulation 
program supported by many of the nation’s 
largest food and beverage companies. The 
mission of CFBAI is to shift advertising for 
foods that appeal to children to messaging 
that encourages healthier dietary choices. We collaborated closely with CFBAI and other 
participants in developing uniform nutrition criteria. 
Raising the bar for nutritional standards of foods 
marketed to children under the age of 12, CFBAI’s 
uniform nutrition criteria require that advertised 
foods contribute important food groups including 
fruits, vegetables, non/low-fat dairy, whole grains, 
essential nutrients, or some combination of these 
components. CFBAI’s criteria also set rigorous 
standards that limit calories, total sugars, sodium, 
saturated fat and trans fat. Conagra Brand’s CFBAI 
pledge and list of food included is available 
here. Recently, all participants in CFBAI agreed 
to adopt revised, stronger uniform nutrition 
criteria for foods advertised to children. The revised 
criteria will further strengthen voluntary efforts to 
help improve child-directed food advertising. We 
believe that CFBAI’s uniform nutrition criteria are 
realistic; the criteria serve to motivate us, and other 
CFBAI participants, to make better-for-you foods.Over the past several years, we have strengthened 
our commitment to responsible advertising 
to children. These are our commitments:
 Devote 100 percent of our advertising directed 
to children under 12 years of age to products 
that meet CFBAI’s uniform nutrition criteria 
 Only use licensed characters, celebrities, 
movie tie-ins and interactive gaming in 
advertising directed to children under 12 
years of age, to food products that meet 
CFBAI’s uniform nutrition guidelines
 Never conduct advertising in elementary 
schools to children under the age of 12 
 Never seek product placements 
in children’s programming
 Never run advertising primarily 
directed to children under 6 years of 
age in TV, radio, print or online

22Our Management Approach 
 
Conagra Brands continuously engages on food 
policies, as appropriate. We determine whether, 
and how, to engage on individual food policies 
based on the impacts to our business, impacts 
to consumers, and our ability to affect change. 
In this way, we focus internal resources on those 
policies (called our policy priorities) that we 
believe are most important, and where we can 
contribute in meaningful ways. Our policy priorities 
are reviewed on at least an annual basis.
With input and support from our business leaders, 
a cross-functional team establishes our policy 
priorities and manages our advocacy efforts in 
support of these priorities. The team is comprised 
of representatives from Legal, Government Affairs, 
Communications and External Relations, and R&D, 
and is led by our SVP , Research & Development and 
VP & Chief Counsel, Legal & Government Affairs. 
The team meets regularly to evaluate our engagement 
and positions related to food policies. The team’s 
evaluations take into account several factors, 
including the political environment and regulations 
surrounding each policy issue, actions or positions of 
our competitors, scientific advances, and business 
considerations such as consumer trends. Regulatory 
compliance often drives our level of engagement 
and positions on particular policies, but consumer 
and industry trends play a role too and in ways that 
might be unrelated to regulatory compliance. Food Policy
Conagra Brands continuously monitors policies of impact to our business. We seek to advance policies that are backed  
by science and beneficial to our business and consumers, while advocating against policies that do not meet these criteria.

23
Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Policy Priorities
As of September, 2018, these were our policy priorities and some of our key efforts 
1  Nutrition policy is always an active priority for 
us. During fiscal year 2018 and beyond, we are 
focused on these topics:  
 FDA Sodium Activity: Ensuring guidance that 
may be issued by FDA is science-based and 
provides adequate time for implementation. 
By leveraging our nutrition expertise and 
consumer knowledge, we are providing the 
FDA with public comments and other support 
to advance the conversation and regulatory 
framework.  
 Implementation of federal nutrition 
standards related to foods sold under the 
National School Lunch Program and School 
Breakfast Program: Support our customers 
(i.e. local school districts) in their push to 
allow flexibility in the sodium and whole 
grains’ standards for the NSLP & NSBP .
2  International trade policy has broad impacts 
to Conagra, both economically and in terms 
of how we get products to market. We are 
closely monitoring ongoing negotiations of 
the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
(USMCA), as well as the separate issue of 
retaliatory tariffs that have been issued on 
U.S. imports and exports, primarily due to 
the China 301 and Section 232 issues.3  Labeling of bioengineered foods or 
ingredients will become mandatory for 
many food products under the National 
Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard. 
Conagra Brands had expressed public 
support for disclosure and will timely comply 
with the final labeling rule issued by USDA.
4  Section 232 tariffs on steel/aluminum 
imports: Earlier in 2018, global tariffs were 
levied on the primary input used in food cans, 
tinplate steel, significantly raising the cost of 
our cans. We are advocating for a broad tariff 
exemption for tinplate steel used in food cans.  
5  The safety of our food is Conagra’s top 
priority. Food safety regulations have 
significant impact over the way in which 
we manufacture our products and run 
our facilities. During fiscal year 2018 and 
beyond, we will continue to work in close 
collaboration with the FDA as we monitor 
the day-to-day impacts of Food Safety 
Modernization Act (FSMA) implementation in 
our facilities. We are also actively monitoring 
and engaging through trade associations on 
guidance development for control of listeria 
monocytogenes in not-ready-to-eat foods.The Conagra Brands 
Employee PAC
Conagra Brands believes that political 
participation at all levels of government is 
important to our business and our country 
and, as such, encourages voluntary 
participation by employees in public policy 
debates impacting the food manufacturing 
sector. We offer eligible employees an 
opportunity to coordinate and maximize the 
effect of their political efforts by voluntarily 
contributing to the Conagra Brands Good 
Government Association (the “Conagra 
Brands Employee PAC”), in accordance 
with Federal Election Commission (the 
“FEC”) regulations. Employee participation 
is entirely a matter of personal choice. 
The Conagra Brands Employee PAC 
contributes to candidates, regardless 
of political party, who are supportive of 
Conagra Brands’ corporate business 
interests and public policy goals. The 
PAC typically raises and distributes less 
than $50,000 annually. All PAC activity is 
disclosed in publicly-available reports 
filed with the FEC are available here.

25
Contents     Overview     Good Food     Responsible Sourcing      Better Planet     Stronger Communities     About this ReportResponsible Sourcing
Conagra Brands uses many different ingredients 
and packaging materials to make and package our 
food. Responsible sourcing—from a responsible 
supply chain—is key to stable, long-term access to 
the inputs we need, and is an essential component 
of corporate accountability. We are accountable, 
not only for the ingredients and other materials in 
our products, but also for how they are sourced. 
The majority of our environmental, social 
and related economic impacts lie outside 
of Conagra Brands’ direct operations and 
within our extended supply chain. 
We recognize that, based on our business 
relationships, we are directly linked to impacts 
in our extended supply chain. Therefore, our 
commitment to responsible sourcing requires 
us to manage supplier relationships in ways that 
appropriately address those impacts, risks and 
opportunities. Climate change impacts, water 
scarcity, and human rights concerns are among 
the many sourcing risks that can be mitigated 
through responsible sourcing policies. Responsible 
sourcing is also key to developing products 
with socially and environmentally responsible 
attributes that consumers today demand. Management Approach 
Our CSR Steering Committee is responsible for 
leading our responsible sourcing work, including 
the development of goals and strategies. The 
CSR Steering Committee oversees a cross-
functional team of procurement, sustainability 
and social responsibility experts, whose 
management of responsible sourcing is 
integrated into their day-to-day job functions. 
Our approach to taking action on specific topics 
related to ingredients or packaging materials 
is collaborative, with our technical experts 
working hand-in-hand with category managers in 
Enterprise Procurement. We utilize science-based 
tools, supplier assessments, and our Supplier 
Code of Conduct to identify, monitor and reduce 
environmental and social risks in our supply chain, 
and the associated economic impacts. We manage 
the risks by sourcing from low-risk geographies, 
implementing commodity-specific procurement 
policies that address topics such as animal welfare 
and deforestation, and by sourcing certified 
sustainable ingredients and materials, where most 
impactful and meaningful to our stakeholders. 
In addition, we seek to identify and execute on 
responsible sourcing opportunities and other 
opportunities for continuous improvement. We do this by building strong partnerships with our 
suppliers, other industry partners, and NGOs that 
are focused on advancing responsible sourcing. 
We also tailor our management approach to 
complement the influence and relationships we 
have with each supplier. For example, where we 
have direct relationships with suppliers, we work 
with each one individually to enact change. By 
contrast, in instances where we are managing 
responsible sourcing issues embedded further 
in our supply chain, we often leverage the 
expertise and influence of NGOs or industry 
associations to drive change in the marketplace.
Supply chain transparency is critical, which is why 
we communicate openly about our supply chain 
performance. Conagra Brands participates in 
the CDP Forests disclosure program, reporting 
annually on our deforestation risks and mitigation 
strategies for palm oil, beef, timber-based products 
and soy. We recognize that our sourcing decisions 
around palm oil, beef, timber and soy carry 
important social and environmental considerations. 
We also participate in CDP Water and Climate 
Change disclosures, which address sourcing 
risks across our portfolio. These disclosures 
are a key step in our ongoing planning efforts 
around sustainable commodity management.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Supplier Management and Engagement
We expect our suppliers to conduct business in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations  
and with high standards of integrity and business ethics, consistent with industry best practices.  
Supplier Code of Conduct 
Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers (issued in 
2015 and last updated in January 2017) outlines the 
basic expectations for doing business with Conagra 
Brands. Our Supplier Code of Conduct applies 
across the board to all of our suppliers, and covers 
legal compliance to workplace and human rights; 
animal welfare; health, safety and the environment; 
ethical dealings; and monitoring and recordkeeping. 
To specifically support our commitments to 
environmental protection, we also expect suppliers 
to have the commitment and ability to remediate 
any environmental problems that they might cause.
Conagra Brands uses a rigorous due diligence 
process to ensure that we have appropriate 
documentation regarding new suppliers and 
the materials to be purchased from them. This 
includes, but is not limited to, spec sheets, allergen 
information, conflicts of interest disclosures, 
third-party audits and country of manufacture 
statements. Our Supplier Quality and Risk 
team reviews all materials to be purchased, 
where those materials come from, the potential 
supplier’s third-party audit, proposed final use 
of the material and other information about the 
material or supplier. The Supplier Quality team 
also looks at new suppliers’ conformance with 
specific expectations set forth in our Supplier 
Expectations Manual (issued in May 2008 and last revised April 2017). These due diligence screens 
specifically include criteria related to environmental 
compliance, child labor and human trafficking. 
Dedicated procurement staff provide continuous 
support to each direct supplier via periodic 
touchpoints to discuss any sustainability 
developments or other issues that might arise. 
In addition, Conagra Brands legal and human 
resources teams facilitate internal compliance 
expectations in supplier operations, with 
confidential reporting channels for grievances 
related to concerns such as bribery or corruption. 
Each requirement within our Supplier Code of 
Conduct must be absolutely and continuously met 
and supported by appropriate documentation. 
We maintain full rights to inspect facilities and 
review applicable documentation to ensure 
compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct also specifies that 
our suppliers must take reasonable actions to 
ensure that their suppliers and sub-contractors 
comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct. We 
provide guidance to our suppliers regarding sub-
contracting and require them to replicate our 
requirements all the way down their supply chains.Our Supplier Code of 
Conduct applies across 
the board to all of our 
suppliers, and covers legal 
compliance to workplace 
and human rights; animal 
welfare; health, safety and 
the environment; ethical 
dealings; and monitoring 
and recordkeeping.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Supplier Excellence Program 
  
In fiscal year 2017, Conagra Brands launched a new 
Supplier Excellence Program, which we enhanced in 
fiscal year 2018. The Supplier Excellence Program 
applies to our top direct material suppliers, which 
includes 60 suppliers, representing approximately 
75 percent of our overall spend on food ingredients, 
commodities and packaging direct material spend. 
Under the program, we use a scorecard to 
assess our top direct suppliers on qualitative and 
quantitative measures. The suppliers are evaluated 
against four key metrics:  
 
 Supplier Advantaged Growth  
 Operating a Lean Supply Chain
 Sustaining Competitive Margins
 Enabling the Conagra Way  
 
As part of our Supplier Excellence Program, 
Conagra Brands assesses key suppliers annually on 
environmental and social risk-related performance 
and disclosure. We rate suppliers within our 
Supplier Excellence program based on a review 
of public records and related documents provided 
to us by the supplier. These metrics include public 
supplier response to CDP Water, Forest and 
Investor questionnaires; GRI-compliant reporting; 
and policy/commitments adequately addressing 
sustainability risks specific to the supplier’s industry, 
including climate change. The annual sustainability 
assessment is supplemented by quarterly 
performance discussions and risk analyses, and we 
work in partnership with our suppliers to address 
any issues or gaps. The quantitative scoring system 
allows us to measure supplier progress over time, 
with our measure of success being a progressive 
increase in the number of high-scoring suppliers.We recognize top performing suppliers at our 
annual Supplier Excellence Summit, with two 
awards added in 2018 to recognize suppliers who 
represent industry best practices in Sustainability 
and Diversity & Inclusion. Winners are chosen from 
among the highest-rated suppliers according to 
our environmental and social risk assessment, and 
represent companies demonstrating excellence in 
transparency, management practices, and progress 
on public goals and related commitments. 
The Supplier Excellence Program is strengthening 
our supplier relationships in many ways. It provides 
our top direct suppliers with deeper clarity and 
insights into our sourcing needs and key challenges; 
fosters deep collaboration through ongoing business 
reviews and cross-functional business teams; and 
aligns our organizations to achieve mutual success 
and create joint value. Going forward, into 2019, 
Conagra Brands will expand the successful program 
to include indirect suppliers (those that provide 
services and supplies to keep our business running).Supplier Advisory Board  
 
In fiscal 2018, Conagra Brands formed a Supplier 
Advisory Board to engage key suppliers more 
holistically across the entire value chain. The 
new Supplier Advisory Board is comprised of 12 
suppliers from our Supplier Excellence Program and 
other high impact suppliers, together with cross-
functional representation from Conagra Brands’ 
Procurement, R&D and Operations businesses. 
The Supplier Advisory Board seeks to build 
stronger supplier relationships while supporting 
the Conagra Brand values of External Focus, 
Broad Mindedness and Agility. Key focus areas for 
the Supplier Advisory Board in year one were:
 
 Innovation—leveraging suppliers 
earlier in the innovation process  
 Value Creation—supplier-led plant  
“deep dives” to identify opportunities  
 Communication—enhancing communication 
around outages, inventory and forecasts  
 On-time In Full—piloting program with 
members of Supplier Advisory Board

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Sourcing Risk Analysis 
and Responsible 
Sourcing Priorities 
In 2018, Conagra Brands conducted an ESG 
(Environmental, Social and Governance) analysis 
to identify risks, opportunities and impacts 
related to the ingredients and packaging materials 
we procure. We looked at the impact of each 
ingredient or material on our portfolio, as well as 
economic, environmental and social impacts tied 
to the regions we source from, customer sourcing 
requirements, consumer demand, and corporate 
social responsibility topics material to our business.
Our ESG analysis considered sourcing risks such 
as: deforestation, human rights concerns, labor 
violations, geopolitical country of origin risks, climate 
change impacts, and animal welfare concerns. In 
addition, we considered the economic impacts of 
ingredient and material access on our portfolio. 
We identified a list of 14 priority ingredients and 
materials that have the most significant economic, 
social and environmental impacts. Our Responsible 
Sourcing Priorities together account for over  
65 percent of our annual direct material spend. 
We have developed specific sourcing policies 
for many of the commodities on our list of 
Responsible Sourcing Priorities, and are in the 
process of developing policies for the others. We 
have outlined items that are covered by specific 
management policies in this report. We plan 
to review our Responsible Sourcing Priorities 
annually and update the list, as appropriate.INGREDIENT/MATERIAL PRIMARY SOURCING REGIONS RISK MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Management Strategies Related to Key Sourcing Risks and Impacts
Deforestation  
 
Forests play a key role in mitigating climate change 
by capturing and storing carbon dioxide in plant 
materials. Deforestation destroys the carbon dioxide 
sinks, which negatively impacts ecosystems, plant 
and animal species, and water systems, and also 
releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
Experts estimate that deforestation accounts  
for approximately 15 percent of global greenhouse 
gas emissions.1 
Certain responsible sourcing priorities (including soy, 
fiber-based packaging, palm oil and cattle products) 
must be appropriately managed to address global 
concern for deforestation. We are developing 
commodity-specific deforestation policies based on 
a review of environmental and social impacts related 
to current industry practices, country-specific 
pressures on forestland from human settlement 
or other trends, levels of regulatory protection 
for ecologically sensitive areas, and commodity 
demand trajectories that might increase cultivation 
and workforce needs. Deforestation policies may 
evolve as we are able to further analyze and address 
deforestation risks across all our priority ingredients.FIBER-BASED PACKAGING 
PROCUREMENT APPROACH
We annually disclose management practices 
to manage timber, soy, beef and palm oil 
deforestation risks to investors and other 
stakeholders via CDP , where we’ve earned B or 
A-level responses over the last two years.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018PALM OIL PROCUREMENT POLICY 
Due to the unique properties of palm oil,  
Conagra Brands uses it as a functional ingredient in 
several of our branded and food service products, 
including popcorn, peanut butter, pudding 
and hot cocoa. Palm oil cultivation, harvesting 
and processing pose potential environmental 
and social risks, specifically deforestation of 
the world’s rainforests and negative impacts 
on the communities that depend on them.
Out of concern for these risks and their impacts, 
Conagra Brands is committed to promoting the 
production, procurement and use of sustainable 
palm oil products. Since 2011, we have been 
communicating our sustainable palm oil purchases 
as a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 
Oil (RSPO), an organization dedicated to promoting 
the growth and use of sustainable palm oil products 
through credible global standards and stakeholder 
engagement. We purchase palm oil only from RSPO 
members in order to support development of a 
sustainable, cost-effective market for palm oil. One hundred percent of the palm oil we purchase 
today adheres to RSPO standards for environmental 
and social responsibility. This means that all of our 
suppliers’ landholdings and operations meet the 
following principles: 
 Only legal sources that adhere to all 
relevant international, national and 
local legislation and regulation
 No development on high conservation value 
landscapes or high carbon stock (HCS) forests. 
 No development on peat lands regardless 
of depth and use of best management 
practices for existing plantations on peat. 
 No burning in the preparation of new plantings, 
re-plantings or other developments and the 
progressive reduction of GHG emissions.  Respect for land tenure rights, including the 
rights of indigenous and local communities to 
give or withhold their free, prior and informed 
consent to all new development or operations 
on lands to which they hold legal, communal 
or customary rights. Prevention and resolution 
of social and/or land conflicts through an 
open, transparent and consultative process. 
 Traceability to the extraction mill and validation 
of fresh fruit bunches to the plantation estate. 
Adherence to RSPO standards is verified either 
via Book and Claim or Mass Balance systems. 
In calendar year 2017, 35 percent of our palm oil 
supply carried RSPO ETrace certificates, and  
65 percent of our palm oil supply was RSPO Mass 
Balance. To prepare for 100 percent RSPO Mass 
Balance adoption by 2020, we have secured supply 
chain certification for 100 percent of our production 
facilities that use palm oil.1 Certification of these 
facilities enable use of Mass Balance certified 
oil for 100 percent of our palm oil products. 
Peter Pan® Peanut Butters   
Situated in prime peanut-growing country, nearly all of the 
peanuts used in our Peter Pan peanut butter are grown 
within 250 miles of our facility in Sylvester, Ga. Consumers are 
increasingly seeking out more sustainable food options, with 
sustainability a top attribute among those who are buying 
plant-based foods. We use RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm 
Oil across all of our Peter Pan peanut butter varieties.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018From Farm to Fork
As a global food company, Conagra Brands sources ingredients from 
around the world to deliver high-quality, flavorful and nutritious products. 
Our supply chain includes business partners located throughout the 
U.S., and provenance is a consideration in our purchasing strategy.
BEAN SPROUTS
For over 40 years, bean sprouts 
for our La Choy® brand have been 
grown, harvested, and packaged 
on site at our manufacturing facility 
in Archbold, Ohio using reclaimed 
water. When the bean sprouts 
are ready, they are harvested and 
carried to another area of our facility 
where they are packed into items 
such as La Choy Bean Sprouts and 
other La Choy Stir Fry products.
PINTO BEANS
Pinto beans used in Rosarita® 
refried beans are grown in 
Minnesota and North Dakota. DAIRY
Located in the heart of Wisconsin dairy 
country, our Swiss Miss® facility in 
Menomonie, Wis., buys approximately 
25 million gallons of milk annually from 
a local network of dairy farms located 
less than 100 miles from our facility. 
POPCORN 
Approximately 200 farmers in 
Nebraska, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, 
Missouri and South Dakota raise more 
than 300 million pounds of popcorn 
for Conagra Brands each year. More 
than 90% of these farmers have 
grown for us for at least 10 years, 
with many being second- and third-
generation farmers whose families 
have been our partners for decades.ANGIE’S® SUNFLOWER OIL  
Fourth-generation farmer Keith Monson grows sunflowers 
on his family farm in Fargo, ND, which are used for oil 
in some Angie’s BOOMCHICKAPOP products. Due to 
sunflower drought tolerance, Keith does not need to 
irrigate his field. He practices no-till farming to support soil 
health, and cultivates bees on the farm to help preserve 
pollinator populations. After harvesting, the sunflowers 
are sent to a nearby Cargill oil refinery, where they are 
processed using renewable energy. A sunflower processing byproduct is 
reused as golf course fertilizer for added “circular economy” benefits.”

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018HUNT’S® TOMATOES  
Grown within a 250-mile radius of our tomato 
fresh-pack facilities in Oakdale, Calif., our 
tomatoes are typically prepared less than eight 
hours after being harvested. According to 
California Tomato Growers Association 2015 
data, more than 95 percent of the U.S. processed 
tomatoes, and nearly one-third of the world’s 
processed tomatoes, are grown in California.
Over the past decade, our growers have installed 
drip irrigation systems on 97 percent of contracted 
acres, improving sustainable farming practices by: 
 Enabling growers to install permanent beds 
and apply conservation tillage practices, 
reducing farm equipment fuel use. 
 Reducing water use by nearly  
15 percent compared to traditional 
furrow irrigation systems. 
 Reducing nutrient and crop 
management chemical application 
rates due to precise application. 
 Enabling growers to plant fewer acres while 
yielding the same amount of tomatoes. 
Drip irrigation systems increase the tons 
per acre by approximately 30 percent.
We have also found a key sustainability opportunity 
in the way that tomatoes are transported. Conagra 
Brand’s Oakdale field-to-plant tomato transporter 
launched a cleaner fuel fleet with larger capacity 
per vehicle, reducing the number of trips needed 
to haul Conagra Brands’ tomatoes. The fleet runs 
on B20 fuel – a 20 percent biodiesel formulation – 
which cuts transportation carbon dioxide emissions 
15 percent. Using a biodiesel trucking fleet with 
larger capacity tubs decreased the number of trips 
needed during the fresh pack season by 5 percent.One of Conagra Brands’ longstanding tomato 
suppliers is Casaca Vineyards, the Coelho family’s 
farm in Fresno County, California. Through improved 
farming practices and technologies, the Coelho 
family has increased tomato yields over the past 
20 years while decreasing agricultural inputs. 
Specialists take regular plant and soil samples 
to determine soil fertility and moisture content. 
These data are input into a computer program 
that suggests the most resource-efficient irrigation 
schedule, which Julie and her team validate based on their expertise and experience. Subsurface drip 
irrigation systems on all of Casaca Vineyards’ fields 
supply water and fertilizer more efficiently, and 
reduce runoff that can contaminate water sources.
The Coelho family is also dedicated to supporting 
farm workers and their families. Casaca 
Vineyards provides educational scholarships 
to employees’ school-age children. 
THE COELHO FAMILY FARM IN FRESNO COUNTY , CALIFORNIA has 
been growing tomatoes for the Hunt’s brand for 25 years. The Coelho 
family farm consists of 31-year old Julie Coelho, her husband, her 
father, other family members, and their employees.  Eight years ago, 
fourth-generation farmer Julie returned to the farm full time, and still 
remembers the same employees from when she was growing up.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Animal Welfare 
Conagra Brands is committed to the humane 
treatment of animals, in accordance with the 
internationally-recognized five freedoms of  
animal welfare.
 
 Freedom from hunger and thirst,  
by ready access to water and a diet  
to maintain health and vigor. 
 Freedom from discomfort, by providing 
an appropriate environment. 
 Freedom from pain, injury and disease, by 
prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment. 
 Freedom to express normal behavior, by 
providing sufficient space, proper facilities  
and appropriate company  
of the animal’s own kind. 
 Freedom from fear and distress,  
by ensuring conditions and treatment that 
avoid mental suffering.  
Our policy on animal welfare, which is part of our 
Supplier Code of Conduct, requires suppliers to 
implement humane procedures to prevent the 
mistreatment of animals at all times, including when 
the animals are raised, cared for, transported, and 
processed. This includes providing an environment 
that is free from stress, cruelty, abuse, and neglect 
throughout the life of the animals, in accordance 
with the five freedoms of animal welfare. 
We maintain ongoing dialogues with our suppliers 
regarding their implementation of animal welfare 
policies. We encourage all of them to purchase 
only from farms that comply with industry 
guidelines, including those established by the USDA and the Food Marketing Institute. We also 
support commodity-specific programs, such as 
Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) and Pork Quality 
Assurance Plus (PQA Plus), which define animal-
specific best management practices and guidelines. 
These types of programs are very useful, because 
the program standards can be verified through 
third party audits and reflect best practices on 
everything from the raising of farm animals to 
herd health, animal handling, and processing.
        Broiler Chickens  
Working with our suppliers, peers and other 
external stakeholders, it is our goal to shift 
production practices such that by 2024, 100% of 
the chicken we use in our products comes from 
either RSPCA or Global Animal Partnership (GAP)-
approved breeds or strains. These standards 
ensure humane living environment standards 
for lighting, litter, enrichments, stocking density, 
and prohibit the use of broiler cages. We will 
track compliance via third-party auditing.
        Laying Hens 
 
We maintain ongoing dialogues with our suppliers 
to implement animal welfare policies that support 
animal safety and provide consumers with high-
quality products. Similar to other food manufacturers 
and retailers, Conagra Brands has made an 
ambitious commitment to source 100% cage-
free eggs throughout U.S. and Canada operations 
by 2025. In 2018, Conagra Brands incorporated 
one million cage-free eggs into our products.        Pork  
 
We have learned from animal welfare experts 
and our supplier dialogues that sow welfare 
management is most effective when tailored to 
farm operations. Within our pork supply chain, 
there is industry movement to modified housing 
for sows, with several successful variations on 
the modified housing approach. We support 
producer-specific animal welfare practices in line 
with widely accepted animal welfare systems 
grounded in scientific research. Some of the 
expert sources we look to for guidance include 
best practices from the Colorado Pork Producers 
Council and Temple Grandin’s academic research.
We also require pork producers to adhere to the 
Pork Quality Assurance® Plus (PQA Plus) program 
to manage their production system. In addition to 
covering animal welfare practices, the PQA Plus 
framework addresses food safety, protecting public 
health, and other responsible business practices.
        Dairy 
 
Our U.S. dairy supply includes dairies adhering to 
the National Dairy Farmers Assuring Responsible 
Management (FARM) Animal Care Program. The 
FARM Animal Care Program establishes verified 
dairy animal welfare management standards 
for the dairy industry. The program utilizes 3rd-
party evaluators that certify that standards are 
being followed on the farm. FARM also highlights 
best management practices and provides 
methods of corrective action and continuous 
improvement, in line with the latest research 
on animal welfare and animal handling.

Contents     Overview     Good Food     Responsible Sourcing     Better Planet      Stronger Communities     About this Report2020 Sustainability Goals
Conagra Brands is committed to making the 
planet better. Our sustainability goals guide us to 
source raw ingredients and packaging materials 
responsibly, to generate less waste for disposal, 
to reduce energy use and water use, and to help 
preserve our forests and other resources. 
We focus our resources in key areas where it matters 
most across our value chain. Climate change, water 
resources and waste are the most material issues 
and, therefore, key areas of focus for us. Climate 
change affects agricultural industries throughout 
the world and is a fundamental challenge to food 
production. It is dramatically affecting how we source raw ingredients to make our food, and how 
we manage energy use in our facilities and across 
our value chain. Water resources are also essential 
throughout our value chain. From growing our raw 
ingredients to preparing and enjoying our food, all 
of us depend upon clean water every day. And, 
preventing waste—particularly food waste—is an 
important measure of our operating efficiency and 
an important social and environmental issue. 
It is no small feat to achieve what food companies 
like ours want to do—help to build a sustainable 
global food supply and care for the planet. 
Our sustainability goals outline measurable objectives for the next several years. We work 
deliberately on multiple fronts to manage 
environmental risks and impacts and to leverage 
opportunities—through our passionate employees 
and through collaborations with others. 
The sustainability goals addressed in this section 
were created in 2014. We recognize that our 
business has changed dramatically since then, 
including the sale of our private label operations 
in February 2016, the spin-off of our Lamb 
Weston potato business in November 2016 and 
the very recent acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. 
As a result, our current business has a much 
different environmental footprint than when the 
sustainability goals were created. We have also 
witnessed changes in the broader market, including 
commitments to science-based climate action. 
Hundreds of leading companies have recognized 
the opportunity and imperative to set their emissions 
targets in line with climate science. In October 
2018, Conagra Brands committed to adopt 
science-based targets in line with the Science 
Based Targets Initiative and we are now in the 
process of setting our targets. These must be set 
within 24 months of our initial commitment and 
we are working diligently to have these in place 
much sooner. We will share further details on our 
website and in next year’s Citizenship Report, 
but our goal is to complete this much sooner. 
In the meantime, for the purpose of this report, 
data has been adjusted to remove private label and 
Lamb Weston data to more accurately show the 
year-over-year progress of our current business.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Environmental Management
As outlined in our global Environment, 
Occupational Health and Safety Philosophy, 
signed by CEO Sean Connolly in 2015, Conagra 
Brands is dedicated to making great food in 
an environmentally responsible way. We have 
articulated very broad commitments to our 
employees, our customers, our shareholders, 
and the communities in which we live and 
operate—promises that drive us towards 
continuous environmental, health and safety 
(“EH&S”) improvement, as measured by our 
leading environmental and safety indicators and 
implemented through our EH&S management 
approach. To further demonstrate our commitment 
to complying with environmental laws and 
regulations and to protecting natural resources, 
we have created and educated employees on 
five environmental and sustainability policies: 
Environmental, Compliance, Climate Change,  
Water Stewardship and Resource Conservation.  Compliance with federal, state and local 
environmental laws and regulations provides the 
foundation for our sustainability programs. Through 
the implementation of a robust Environmental 
Management System, we proactively manage 
environmental issues and share best practices 
among our facilities around the world. Furthermore, 
we routinely assess compliance through internal 
environmental audits. When compliance issues 
arise, our team of environmental professionals works 
closely with the affected facility to educate and 
develop effective action plans and track findings 
to resolution. In fiscal year 2018, Conagra Brands 
received sixteen Notices of Violation (NOVs) and 
paid a total of $4,000 in environmental fines. Out 
of the sixteen NOVs, we paid financial penalties 
associated with two. Per our standard procedure, 
each NOV was assessed to determine any 
opportunities to prevent or mitigate the situations 
going forward. Further information about our 
approach to employee Health & Safety can be 
found in the Stronger Communities section.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Climate Change
Climate change is one of the food industry’s most 
significant environmental challenges, impacting 
our agricultural supply base, potentially threatening 
our water supply and fundamentally altering 
growing regions. Agriculture is highly dependent 
on specific climate conditions such as temperature 
and precipitation, which determine the viability and 
yield of crops. Extreme weather conditions, such 
as drought, flooding, hurricanes and tsunamis, 
are exacerbated by climate change and threaten 
consistent access to ingredients and materials, 
manufacturing and transportation networks. 
Though understanding the specific impacts on 
our food supply is complex and mired in variability 
and uncertainty, climate change already is 
fundamentally changing how we source ingredients. 
It is also affecting other companies all along our 
value chain, including in the transportation and 
industrial sectors, where there is pressure to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change must 
be addressed today to build resiliency in the future. 
Our Management Approach  
Because climate change is a critical issue for us, 
we continuously incorporate climate change risks 
into market strategy across our procurement, 
risk management, EH&S, operations, and R&D 
teams. Our efforts to mitigate climate change 
have broad impacts on our performance in the 
marketplace, affecting everything from our public 
citizenship goals to our ingredient and materials 
procurement strategies, R&D-driven product 
development, and enterprise risk management.Our greenhouse gas management program is  
founded on our understanding of facility-specific 
emission sources and our diverse product portfolio. 
We know that approximately 93 percent of  
Conagra Brands’ Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions result 
from natural gas and electricity use, which means 
that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is linked 
to improving energy efficiency. We also know that 
there is a wide range of energy required to prepare 
different foods in our portfolio. For example, it 
takes far less energy to put Orville Redenbacher’s® 
popcorn seeds in a bag than it does to steam peel 
and can our Hunt’s® tomatoes. This kind of insight 
allows us to make strategic decisions about where 
and how we focus our resources to reduce energy 
use and related emissions. We know that steam, 
compressed air and freezing systems are energy 
intensive, so we look for reduction opportunities 
in facilities with one or more of these systems. 
We report progress towards annual GHG emission 
reduction goals, along with other sustainability 
metrics, to our operations leadership team as part 
of our monthly business reviews. Progress affects 
performance appraisals for operations leadership, 
plant management and other key individuals. 
Conagra Brands has responded to the CDP’s 
Climate Change questionnaire since 2008,  
providing detail on the business risks and 
opportunities related to climate change.  
Our 2018 response can be found here. In October 2018, Conagra Brands signed 
on to the Science Based Targets Initiative. 
This is our first step in evaluating and setting 
a science-based greenhouse gas emission 
reduction goal that addresses Scope 1, 2 and 
3 emissions for our business. Adopting a new 
science based goal might lead us to adjust 
our management approaches in the future.
CONAGRA BRANDS’ CLIMATE-RELATED 
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS HAS 5 STEPS
1. IDENTIFY 
Uncover, track and spotlight key risk exposures 
in the enterprise portfolio. We have developed 
in-house climate change risk mapping tools to 
identify and monitor physical impacts of climate 
change such as extreme weather and drought 
using WRI Aqueduct, NOAA and other sources.  
2. QUANTIFY
Use risk scoring analysis to calculate 
probability, time to impact and severity   
3. MANAGE 
Assign accountability   
4. MITIGATE
Apply strategies to eliminate or reduce the 
possibility or severity of risk exposure  
5. MONITOR
Continuously review progress against 
action plans to mitigate risks

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Marshall, Mo. employees identified the blast cell time each 
SKU requires to reach the appropriate temperature—cutting 
down blast cell cycles of 20–30 hours to shorter, automated 
cycles. The project team used temperature probes to determine 
the optimum blast cell freeze times for every SKU produced at 
the Marshall facility. The team found that SKU target temperatures 
often could be reached much faster. They then programmed optimum blast 
cell cycle times for each SKU into the blast cell control panel. This change 
improved energy efficiency by reducing cycle times. It also freed up employee 
resources: with fewer daily interruptions, our boiler and refrigeration 
mechanics are able to focus on other important work. Quincy, Mich. maintenance mechanics and stationary 
engineers replaced fluorescent lighting fixtures with LED 
technology designed to improve the visibility in the warehouse 
while saving energy. The Quincy facility, built in 1975, utilizes 
much of its original infrastructure, including florescent tube 
lighting systems that are expensive to maintain. Fifteen percent of 
the energy used by fluorescent bulbs is dissipated as heat, increasing the load 
on Quincy’s refrigeration system. Therefore, the maintenance team replaced 
light fixtures with LED lights and occupancy sensors in the warehouse. The 
project improved visibility and reduced electrical consumption 9 percent 
over the three-year period from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2018.
Our Macon, Mo. facility implemented automated energy 
controls for high pressure water pumps that better respond 
to varied operational water needs throughout the day. 
Macon wanted to improve the energy efficiency of sanitation 
processes by automatically controlling high pressure pumps 
based on usage. The team added automated controls that monitor 
and control pump activation and rotation based on timing and pressure 
requirements. Pump motors ramp up and down as demand for water 
changes, and pumps shut off as demand for water decreases throughout 
the day. Not only does automatic shutoff lower energy use, but automation 
leads to improved water pressure consistency for better cleanup cycles.1,380

the centralized chiller cooling system, which needed 
replacing. Taking advantage of the long cold season in 
Minnesota, the facility installed a more efficient refrigerant 
chiller, added an additional air-to-air chiller and increased 
the heat exchange capability in the system. The new system 
reduces the energy load to chill water by using fresh outside air to aid 
plant cooling processes. The new system also leads to a more dependable 
chill water supply for the presses, which improves product quality. Nearly 
seven percent of the system’s cost was offset by rebates and incentives. 
The installation also improved dependability of the system, which provided 
a monetary benefit not included in payback period calculations.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Scope 3 GHG Emissions
Conagra Brands also reports on select 
Scope 3 GHG emissions where: 
 Data is reasonably available 
 Emission factors are accurate  
and based on sound science 
 The value and insights gained from  
the information outweigh the costs  
of gathering the data  Keeping valuable byproducts out  
of landfills reduces emissions too. 
Beginning in fiscal year 2012, we put rigorous 
systems in place to track landfill and material 
diversion data from all of our facilities, using more 
than 15 descriptive categories that are aligned with 
the Environmental Protection Agency’s Waste 
Reduction Model (WARM). This tool enables us 
to better understand the lifecycle GHG emissions 
associated with managing waste materials. With this 
information, we quantify the benefits of diverting 
waste materials from landfills to other uses and 
then identify the highest-value homes for them.
During fiscal year 2018, we estimate the Scope 
3 GHG emissions associated with sending 
waste materials to landfills were 15,832 metric 
tons. Diverting 82.56 percent of materials 
from landfill avoided 135,477 metric tons of 
Scope 3 GHG emissions, which has improved 
from 131,520 metric tons last year.*Upstream Transportation  
and Distribution 
Farm-to-fork transportation and storage of raw 
ingredients, materials and finished products 
contribute to the total environmental footprint 
of our food. Our reported transportation data 
includes the impacts of transportation that Conagra 
Brands influences directly. This covers primarily 
the transportation used to move finished products 
to customers’ distribution centers, though we 
sometimes also manage the transportation of raw 
ingredients. Currently, all of our transportation is 
contracted, and the emissions of those vehicles 
are categorized as Scope 3 GHG emissions in 
accordance with the World Resources Institute 
and the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 
* Compared to landfilling all waste and byproducts generated
By repurposing or recycling what used to be thought of 
as waste into ‘byproducts’, we avoided more than 135,477 
metric tons of GHG emissions from landfills.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Sustainable Transportation Strategy
Conagra Brands relies on a variety of contracted 
transportation services including rail cars, 
intermodal, trucks and ocean freighters to meet the 
inbound and outbound transportation requirements 
for our food. We are focused on improving the 
efficiency of every mode of transportation we 
use, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions. 
We work aggressively with our transportation 
business partners, distributors and customers 
to improve transportation efficiency. Our 
comprehensive sustainable transportation strategy 
focuses on improving efficiency in three ways. First, 
we continuously seek to improve pallet efficiency 
by optimizing package size and orientation to fit 
the most products in each shipment. Second, we 
evaluate available modes of transportation and 
seek to use the most efficient method. For example, 
though intermodal transportation is still a small part of our transportation footprint, we moved 23 
percent more product by intermodal transportation 
in fiscal year 2018 than in fiscal year 2008. Last, 
we encourage our contracted carriers to look for 
opportunities to upgrade their fleets to improve 
efficiency, including trucks equipped with battery-
powered auxiliary systems and aerodynamic 
fairings. Combined, these efforts ensure that we 
move our products as efficiently as possible, which 
reduces costs and greenhouse gas emissions.
Heavy Hauls With Fewer Emissions
Conagra’s Transportation Department worked 
with a contracted supplier (Navajo Express) 
to switch to a lightweight truck, to reduce the 
number of loads between our Reddi-wip® facility 
and cold storage. This simple change eliminated 
600 loads and 255 metric tons of CO 2 annually.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Energy Use & Efficiency
Approximately 93 percent of our Scope 1 & 2 
greenhouse gas emissions result from our use  
of natural gas and electricity. Therefore, we track 
energy use at the facility level on a monthly basis 
and provide regular reports to management, sharing 
progress toward our greenhouse gas reduction 
goal. Many of our locations also track these metrics 
on a daily or weekly basis, making energy use a 
key performance indicator for daily operations. 
Between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2018, we 
decreased our total electricity use by nine percent 
and decreased natural gas use by 18 percent.  
Our energy intensity—the energy use per pound of 
product produced—increased for natural gas by 2.5 
percent, and increased for electricity by 14 percent.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Total Water Withdrawal 
and Water Use per 
Ton of ProductWater Use and Water Quality
Water is undoubtedly among the planet’s most 
critical resources. With agriculture accounting 
for approximately 80 to 90 percent of U.S. 
consumptive water use, our suppliers and 
contracted growers depend on the availability 
of clean water to grow crops and produce the 
ingredients needed for making our food.1 Our 
own facilities rely on access to clean water 
to operate, prepare food on a commercial 
scale and ensure that our equipment meets or 
exceeds food safety and quality standards. 
Our Management Approach  
Conagra Brands’ 2020 sustainability goals include 
a goal to actively address water risk. Our water 
resource strategy guides how we actively manage 
water resources across our value chain, taking 
into account both water use and water quality. 
Beginning in fiscal year 2012, Conagra Brands set 
site-specific water use intensity reduction targets. 
Our facilities’ reduction goals vary, because there 
is a wide range of water demands for the diverse 
foods in our product portfolio. For example, 
some of the foods we make, such as peanut 
butter, require very little process water. Others are 
much more water intensive, related either to food 
preparation or sanitation requirements. This kind 
of insight allows us to make strategic decisions 
about where and how we focus our resources. 
Projects implemented to reduce water use 
include installing water meters, recirculating water 
used to cool equipment, and installing holding 
tanks to maximize the use of reclaimed water We employ a custom in-house risk mapping tool 
that monitors environmental factors including 
extreme weather (e.g., hurricanes, snow, 
tornadoes and storms) and drought conditions 
impacting our supply chain. Each of our supplier 
locations in the U.S. is electronically mapped 
and can be cross-referenced with the latest 
published U.S. government data on drought 
conditions (National Drought Mitigation Center) 
and with the latest published data on extreme 
weather events in the U.S. (National Oceanic) 
and around the world (Atmospheric Association 
& World Meteorological Organization). Our risk 
management team annually analyzes each supplier 
location in the database and communicates threats 
to our R&D and procurement teams. These teams 
use the risk intelligence information to inform their 
product design and manufacturing decisions. 
 
Our risk management team also uses our  
mapping tool to track real-time data on  
weather-related transportation disruptions  
that might impact our business. In fiscal 
year 2018, this tool helped us track and 
assess transportation impacts of hurricanes 
Irma and Harvey in the U.S. Southeast. 
In fiscal year 2018, Conagra Brands decreased 
our total water use by 26 percent compared to 
fiscal year 2008. Our water intensity —  
the water we use per pound of production — 
decreased by 7.3 percent during this same 
time period. Adopting a new science based 
goal might lead us to adjust our management 
approaches to achieve continuous improvement. ■  Water withdrawal use              Water intensity

We use water to move some ingredients 
through our facilities. Flotation helps 
to protect from damage, and allows 
us to better sort our products.
Cooking
Whether we are blanching

peeling tomatoes, we use water 
and steam to cook food. Washing
We need to wash many ingredients 
before cooking them, just as consumers 
would need to do at home. 
Cleaning
Keeping our food safe requires a 
rigorous sanitation schedule. We use 
water routinely to clean our facilities, 
kitchens and preparation areas. Water Withdrawal Source, Water Use & Wastewater Discharge Destination 
More than 12 percent of the water we use in our facilities is recycled and used for irrigation at neighboring farms, returning a significant portion of the water to beneficial agricultural use.

Our Irapuato, Mexico facility’s corn husk system used water 
to lubricate the rollers. A facility team installed an automatic 
water nozzle system to allow water flow at machine start-up 
and for focused, efficient running of the lubrication system. The 
facility also analyzed the hydration system to reduce the overflow 
water without compromising the quality of the product. These 
efforts resulted in a water savings of 76,000 gallons annually from the 
hydration analysis and 404,000 gallons from the corn husk nozzle system.Troy, Ohio employs three main air compressors, two 
of which run continuously to supply air throughout the 
facility. The compressors and the dryer system had been 
cooled by city water. Maintenance management worked 
to switch to a closed-loop glycol cooling system, which 
was being used in other areas of the plant. Implementing 
this change not only saved 12.6 million gallons annually, but also 
reduced condensation in the air lines that routinely caused down 
time. This process resulted in $101,000 annual cost savings.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Direct Water Use Risk
Our direct water use risk assessment covers all 
of our facilities. The assessment includes water 
quality and availability at regional and water basin 
levels, stakeholder conflicts, regulations, ecosystem 
health indicators, and access to sanitation. 
For the past eight years, we have mapped each 
of our facilities against areas of watershed stress. 
Since fiscal year 2014, we have utilized the World 
Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, 
which considers twelve key indicators of water 
risk to create global overall water risk maps. Risk 
indicators include: overall physical risk (quantity 
& quality), baseline water stress, inter-annual 
variability, seasonal variability, flood occurrence, 
drought severity, upstream storage, groundwater stress, return flow ratio, upstream protected 
land, regulatory and reputation, media coverage, 
access to water and threatened amphibians. 
Starting in fiscal year 2016, we began to 
use the Food & Beverage weighting profile 
provided by the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. This 
weighting scheme reflects risks and challenges 
experienced by the Food & Beverage industry, 
with additional weight given to specific risk 
categories based on relevance to our industry. 
Overall water risk results from the mapping 
tool show 37 percent of our facilities as low to 
medium risk, 53 percent as medium to high 
risk, and 11 percent as high risk. The four high risk locations represent just over 22 percent of 
our total annual water use. Fluctuations in our 
facility risk assessment can be attributed to 
changing high risk areas within the Aqueduct 
Water Risk Atlas which is updated annual. 
Effectively managing water resources—both in 
terms of water use efficiency and wastewater 
discharge quality—is one of our top sustainability 
priorities. In the years ahead, we plan to take 
our analysis beyond the Aqueduct Water 
Risk Atlas and leverage knowledge of local 
watersheds and regulatory environments to better 
understand our direct water use risk exposure.

COMMODITY BUSINESS DEPENDENCY EXPOSURE TO WATER STRESS 
Cattle products Beef is the primary ingredient 
in Duke’s,® Slim Jim® 
meat snacks and Hebrew 
National® kosher franks. It is 
also an ingredient  
in select Banquet® and  
Marie Callender’s® 
offerings, Chef Boyardee® 
beef ravioli and other 
canned pasta products. Conagra Brands sources beef from the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Uruguay. Percentage Conagra Brands sourced from water stressed areas 
represents an approximation of major production regions for this commodity that 
fall into medium–extremely high-risk areas on 2018 WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. 
Australia is the most water-stressed geography we source from, but represents a 
very small part of our overall beef sourcing. Though this is our first year of tracking, 
we estimate that the percentage is relativity unchanged from 2016. Under a 
“business-as-usual” scenario of relatively unconstrained emissions, where global 
temperatures increase 2.6–4.8°C by 2100 relative to 1986–2005 levels, 2018 WRI 
Aqueduct maps indicate that these areas are expected to remain at near normal 
water stress or experience a 1.4x increase through 2045 in select pockets. 
Palm oil Palm oil is primarily used in 
Orville Redenbacher’s® and 
ACT II® microwave popcorn, 
margarine products and 
Swiss Miss and Hunt’s® 
Snack Pack puddings and 
Peter Pan® peanut butter. Conagra Brands sources palm oil from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Malaysia, 
Mexico, with the large majority coming from Malaysia. Ceres’ Know the Chain 
investor brief on palm oil risk indicates that the commodity is generally at low 
risk for water use and pollution. Percentage Conagra Brands sourced from water 
stressed areas represents an approximation of major growing regions for this 
commodity that fall into medium–extremely high-risk areas on 2018 WRI Aqueduct 
Water Risk Atlas (majority of Mexico and parts of Ecuador). Though this is our first 
year of tracking, we estimate that the percentage is relativity unchanged from 2016. 
Under a business as usual climate scenario, 2018 WRI Aqueduct maps indicate 
that these areas are expected to remain at near normal water stress, with some 
pockets of decreasing water stress (Ecuador) and increasing water stress (Mexico). 
Timber-based 
products 
(Paper/Pulp) Fiber-based packaging is 
used for virtually all of our 
products for distribution 
packaging and for many of 
our products in primary or 
secondary packaging, e.g. 
microwave popcorn bags 
and folding cartons for 
single serve frozen meals. Timber used to produce Conagra Brands distribution packaging (primary, 
secondary and tertiary) is sourced from Canada, United States and 
Sweden. Percentage sourced from water stressed areas represents an 
approximation of regional sourcing that falls into medium–extremely high-
risk areas on 2018 WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Though this is our first 
year of tracking, we estimate that the percentage is relativity unchanged 
from 2016. Under a business as usual climate scenario, 2018 WRI Aqueduct 
maps indicate these areas are expected to remain at near normal water

Growing water scarcity is the leading 
challenge for sustainable development 
in the U.S. and around the world. 
Our primary strategy for mitigating 
agricultural water risk in our supply 
chain is twofold: (1) working with 
suppliers that implement water 
conservation measures and (2) 
reducing our dependency on 
ingredients and materials sourced from 
areas with chronic water shortages. 
During calendar year 2018, we 
conducted supply chain water 
risk analysis on four commodities 
that are significant to our portfolio, 
as summarized at right.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Eliminating Waste
Nearly all of the solid waste generated at our 
facilities consists of food and packaging materials. 
Wasted food, in particular, is a critical sustainability 
issue. It is socially unacceptable that 42 million 
Americans—including 13 million children—live in 
households that are food insecure. Meanwhile up 
to 40 percent of the food produced in the U.S. 
is thrown away, and approximately 22 percent 
of the waste stream in the U.S. is food. In fact, 
more food reaches landfills and incinerators than 
any other single material in our trash.1 Food in 
landfills generates methane, which is a greenhouse 
gas 23 times as potent as carbon dioxide in 
trapping heat within our atmosphere, contributing 
to global warming. Also, the economic losses 
associated with food waste (and waste of all 
kinds) are bad for business and for all of us. The 
negative economic and environmental impacts are 
compounded by the loss of resources required 
to grow, transport and prepare food; these 
resources are wasted when food is wasted. Our Management Approach 
 
We are working systematically and strategically 
to reduce the amount of waste we generate 
in our facilities to capture the maximum value 
of the raw ingredients and other materials we 
buy. For unavoidable waste, we work hard to 
keep it out of landfills. This is our zero waste-
to-landfill journey (“Zero Waste Journey”).
We have reframed the way we think and talk 
about the food and packaging materials that 
comprise nearly all of the solid waste generated 
at our facilities. Instead of characterizing these 
materials as “waste,” we think of them as 
“byproducts.” This reframing is helping to change 
behaviors at our facilities and strengthen our 
waste reduction efforts. Each year, our plants set 
individual landfill waste reduction targets that help 
us on our Zero Waste Journey. This goal setting 
process includes identifying, documenting and 
addressing any challenges or concerns related to 
the upcoming year. Our annual waste diversion 
goals keep us on our path to zero waste-to-landfill 
in the midst of dynamic business changes. 
For each of our facilities, the sustainability team 
within EH&S tracks landfill and material diversion 
data monthly, using more than 15 descriptive 
categories. With this detailed waste characterization, 
our teams have insight on where the biggest opportunities exist to derive maximum use out of 
our material resources. By identifying sources of 
waste throughout our facilities and practices, we 
find ways to reduce that waste at the source. For 
example, we reduce waste through improved yields, 
first pass quality, strategic production initiatives 
and better design. We also divert waste materials 
in other ways, including recycling, composting, 
and use as energy feed, whenever feasible.
Facility Green Teams comprised of cross-functional, 
employees—are also critical in leading waste 
reduction and recycling programs. These teams 
have proven effective in enhancing recycling efforts 
and identifying opportunities to reduce waste at 
the source. Their efforts are supported by plant 
management and operations leadership, with direct 
assistance provided by the corporate sustainability 
team, Enterprise Procurement, and other functions. 
Progress towards landfill avoidance and waste 
reduction goals is reported to our operations 
leadership team as part of the period review, 
along with reporting on other sustainability 
metrics. Progress is included in performance 
appraisals for operations leadership, plant 
management and other key individuals.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Zero Waste-to-Landfill Journey
We are very proud of the work that we have done to 
keep materials out of landfills. In fiscal year 2018, 82.6 
percent of solid waste generated from our facilities 
was diverted to more beneficial uses through recycling, 
donations to feed people, use as animal feed, energy 
generation or land applications as a soil amendment. 
Eliminating Wasted Food 
Every year, global food loss and waste cause 
approximately 8 percent of total global greenhouse 
gas emissions—nearly the annual amount of emissions 
from global road transportation (“Food wastage 
footprint & Climate Change,” UN FAO). In 2015, over 
30 million tons of food waste in the U.S. alone were 
landfilled, resulting in the release of over 16 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions 
(“Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts 
and Figures Report,” U.S. EPA). These emissions were 
equivalent to the emissions of over 3.5 million cars 
(Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator, U.S. EPA).
Therefore, keeping organic materials out of landfills, 
and avoiding the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, 
is a core component of our waste and climate change 
strategies. Aligned with the principles of the U.S. EPA’s 
Food Waste Recovery Hierarchy, Conagra Brands 
strives to redirect food waste to its most beneficial 
use. This strategy is especially important in our case, 
because food waste makes up a large portion of the 
solid waste and byproducts generated at our facilities. 
Causes of loss and waste are things like yield losses 
during production, excess inventory of discontinued 
products or ingredients, and products that were 
made that did not meet our high quality standards.FY18 Waste

Our Milton, Pa. canning facility 
initiated a rapid improvement 
project to improve production 
practices and reduce yield loss, 
eliminating 1,150 tons of food waste. In Waterloo, Iowa, the 
project team did a study to 
confirm the exact amount of 
bags required to be purged 
during start-up, saving 225,000 
bags of DAVID Seeds per year.
Working Together to Tackle Food Waste
Conagra Brands is an active participant in the Food Waste Reduction Alliance, a collaborative effort 
of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), the National Restaurant Association (NRA) and the 
Food Marketing Institute (FMI). This Alliance brings together key players from food manufacturers, 
food retailers and food service industries to work toward common goals to reduce the generation of 
food waste, to enable more donation to feed hungry people and to recover and recycle more food 
waste—keeping it out of landfills. The Alliance is working tirelessly to raise awareness of food waste in 
the United States and has delivered tools that will help others make progress against these goals. 
In addition, Conagra Brands is proud to be an inaugural member of the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 
Champions group, helping the nation reach its critical food waste reduction goal. In 2015, the USDA and  
U.S. EPA announced the U.S.’s first-ever food loss and waste reduction goal: a 50 percent reduction by 2030. 
Then, in November 2016, they launched the complementary U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions 
group to help the nation meet this ambitious target. As a 2030 Champion, Conagra Brands has made a 
public commitment to reduce food loss and waste in our U.S. operations by 50 percent by the year 2030.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 20181. Source reduction 
Preventing food waste before it is created  
is the best thing we can do for the planet  
and our business. 
In fiscal year 2018, our Waterloo, Iowa Snack Pack 
and David’s Seeds® facility challenged the way 
things had always been done. Seeing unnecessary 
packaging and product waste occurring during 
equipment start-up, a team created a study to 
determine the exact number of bags required to be 
purged during start up and found product quality 
could be maintained while purging less bags. This 
simple change in purge standard saved 225,000 
bags annually or 36 tons of food waste.3. Feed animals  
Ingredients that cannot be used to feed 
people may be used to feed animals. 
The Green Team at our Peter Pan peanut butter 
facility in Sylvester, Georgia, recognized the value 
that still existed in peanut skins and pieces that 
could not be made into our peanut butter. Peanut 
skins are a high-value animal feed, which are 
removed naturally during the peanut roasting 
process. Small improvements were made in fiscal 
year 2018 to help improve the collection process 
and increase the amount captured. As a result, 
2,000 tons of peanut skins and pieces are diverted 
annually to animal feed instead of going to landfills.
4. Industrial use  
Fats, oils and grease should be rendered 
into biofuel, where possible. 
Our Reddi-wip® and table spreads facility in 
Indianapolis, Indiana, partners with a local farm 
to send its wastewater sludge to an on-farm 
anaerobic digester that creates biogas, which 
generates electricity to send back to the grid. 
Previously, this wastewater sludge had been 
applied to land as fertilizer. This partnership is a 
big success. In fiscal year 2018, it enabled us to 
divert 3,400 tons of waste to a higher value use.5. Composting  
Turning food into a valuable soil amendment. 
Conagra Brands’ LEED Certified Gold office 
headquarters in Chicago offers composting 
throughout the facility. Employees are encouraged to 
discard food waste and other acceptable packaging 
items into designated composting bins throughout 
the corporate office. In fiscal year 2018, more 
than 4,000 pounds of waste were composted.Aligned with the principles of the U.S. EPA’s Food Waste Recovery Hierarchy 
2. Feed hungry people  
If our products or ingredients cannot be sold, 
donating to those in need is the next best thing. 
Our Slim Jim® facility located in Troy, Ohio, has 
partnered with Forgotten Harvest, a Detroit-based 
food rescue organization, since 2011 to find use 
for Slim Jim ends. These ends traditionally could 
not be packaged into finished product and were 
being landfilled. Based on the partnership, the end 
pieces started being repackaged for distribution 
to feed hungry people. Based on the success of 
these donations, our facility also started donating 
school lunch pizzas that did not meet internal quality 
standards. In fiscal year 2018, the site donated 
305,000 pounds of pizza in addition to 203,000 
pounds of meat snacks to Forgotten Harvest.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Packaging 
Sustainability
Our packaging plays a key role in delivering our 
great tasting food to consumers. It provides 
information such as nutritional content and 
preparation instructions. It can also offer 
convenience features such as easy open, reclose, 
and dispense, as well as portion control. 
Most important, our packaging protects and 
preserves our food products, which contributes 
to food safety, preserves freshness, and 
extends shelf life. Protecting and preserving our 
products also helps to avoid food waste due to 
food spoilage or damage, both in consumers’ 
homes and throughout the supply chain.
At Conagra, we produce many different food 
products and choose the appropriate packaging 
format for each based on food type and protection 
needed—from paper-based cartons to plastic 
containers to metal cans. We always strive to 
use the right amount, and the right 
kind, of packaging for each product.
Across multiple packaging formats 
and materials, all of our packaging is 
designed in accordance with our key 
principles of sustainable packaging. We 
are committed to producing packaging 
that takes environmental impacts into 
account while ensuring food safety and 
other performance requirements. Management Approach 
Our packaging engineering team (within our research 
and development (R&D) group) is responsible 
for designing, developing and implementing our 
packaging. The team continuously looks for ways 
to use packaging more efficiently and effectively 
without compromising consumer value. 
To inform our approach, we use lifecycle thinking. 
Conagra Brands has invested in lifecycle modeling 
tools for both packaging and product design. These 
tools help us more accurately evaluate the impacts 
of packaging formats and materials from sourcing, 
manufacturing, delivery and consumer use through 
end-of-life. These tools also help us visualize 
potential new foods and processes throughout 
their lifecycles and, therefore, fully consider 
environmental impacts in the development process.
In addition, we take into account consumer 
feedback and the latest scientific evidence, to 
evaluate our packaging material portfolio and 
choose new materials. Our packaging engineering 
team collaborates with an internal cross-functional group of people from the regulatory, toxicology, 
consumer affairs, and chemistry teams, to track and 
discuss ingredients and materials of scientific and 
consumer concern as they emerge in international 
academic research, regulatory activity, news and 
social media. Our commitment to discontinue 
use of Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a good example of 
this. Responding to stakeholder concerns, we 
announced the discontinued use of BPA and vinyl 
coatings in the packaging linings of our entire 
portfolio. The company does import into the U.S. 
and Canada a small quantity of canned products 
with BPA liners and is working with supplier of 
these brands to convert to non-BPA liners. We 
also discontinued the use of vinyl containing liners 
throughout our entire consumer packaging line. As 
we make acquisitions, canned products may be 
added to our portfolio which still contain BPA and/
or vinyl coatings. We will maintain our commitment 
to discontinuing the use of BPA and vinyl in these 
products and work to identify a longer term non-
BPA or non-vinyl option as quickly as possible.
Food safety comes above everything, and 
extends to our packaging. We ensure that our 
packaging material choices meet food safety 
requirements for their intended use as well as meet 
or exceed consumer performance requirements 
and our sustainable packaging principles.
We also constantly look for ways to use packaging 
as a strategic lever to reduce or avoid food waste 
throughout the supply chain and in consumers’ 
homes. Addressing food waste requires a holistic 
approach, and our packaging choices reflect 
the key role that packaging can play here too. CONAGRA BRANDS’

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Healthy Choice Power Bowls
As a consumer food company, Conagra Brands 
uses product innovation to positively impact our 
sustainability footprint and manage agricultural 
risks such as water scarcity and climate change.  
Healthy Choice® launched Power Bowls in 
late spring of 2017, incorporating sustainably-
advantaged ingredients like ancient grains, 
which tend to be more drought-tolerant and 
require fewer pesticides than similar alternatives, 
and can be grown in a variety of climates. The 
product line comes in a renewable plant-based 
fiber bowl, which is cooler to the touch out of 
the microwave and reduces our reliance on 
non-renewable resources for packaging.

 Power Bowls Defining the Role of Packaging in a Sustainable Society
 
Conagra Brands is proud to be a founding member of the American Institute for Packaging 
and the Environment (AMERIPEN), a packaging trade organization created to advocate for 
environmentally and economically sound packaging policy improvements. AMERIPEN educates 
stakeholders about public policies that impact the packaging value chain. The organization has 
made considerable progress in advancing its objectives, completing and publishing primary 
research on packaging’s role in the value chain, collection and recycling infrastructure of the 
100 largest U.S. cities and funding mechanisms for improved collection of used packaging. 
Conagra Brands continues to play a leadership role in these important conversations.
Five years ago, Conagra Brands became a member of the How2Recycle® label program—
one we helped to develop with the Sustainable Packaging Coalition. How2Recycle 
is a standardized labeling system that clearly communicates recycling instructions to 
the public. It was developed to drive clarity and consistency of recycling messages on 
packaged goods, in support of the mission to get more materials out of landfills and 
into recycling bins. We share the How2Recycle mission. As part of our sustainability 
goals, we are actively working to include the How2Recycle label on all Conagra 
Brands products sold in the U.S. Visit www.how2recycle.info for more details.
As part of our commitment to packaging and the environment, Conagra Brands has been 
a member of the Association of Plastics Recyclers (APR) since 2010. APR is the national 
trade association representing companies who collect, reprocess, convert and use more than 
90 percent of the recycled plastic in North America. They serve as an advocacy group for the 
recycling of post-consumer plastics of all kinds by developing standards and programs for 
design for recyclability, testing protocols, and providing factual communication on the benefits 
of recycling for consumers and municipalities. We embrace APR’s goals as a part of our mission 
to deliver quality products with the lowest overall environmental impact using lifecycle thinking.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Conscious Material Choices 
At Conagra Brands, we endeavor to make the 
best packaging material choices for our product 
needs. By being selective regarding what materials 
we use and how much we use, we ensure that 
our products are well-protected without over 
packaging, while actively targeting the reduction 
of food spoilage and subsequent food waste.
 
An example of our discerning use of materials 
can be been seen in the Healthy Choice® Power 
Bowls. For these, we have employed a plant-
based material instead of using petrochemical-
based plastics, which are traditionally used 
in frozen food containers. By using plant 
fiber in our bowl packaging, we are actively 
reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.Another example of thoughtful packaging design 
is the use of a new bakery box opening feature for 
Marie Callender’s® Cream Pies. The new carton 
design is familiar in that consumers interact 
with this opening feature in most store-bought 
bakery items, but the design also is innovative 
in its application to a frozen dessert product.
As part of our research activities, we are also 
exploring ways to drive sustainability into our 
flexible packaging solutions. Our flexible packaging 
extends from shelf stable snacks through to frozen 
convenient meals and sides. Our work in this area 
includes the investigation of bio-based materials, 
biodegradable materials, as well as the use of 
recycled materials. This is a vital part of our R&D 
strategy. There is no reliable recycling network in the U.S. for flexible materials and, because 
we are a leader in this area, we feel a sense of 
ownership in driving sustainable solutions.
Beyond our work in flexible packaging 
systems, we are actively working to 
incorporate sustainable designs and design 
practices into our other packaging types 
through resources such as the Association of 
Plastic Recyclers (APR) Design Guides.
PACKAGING GREEN TEAM 
The Conagra Brands Packaging Green Team 
is a group of passionate packaging engineers 
who launched a grassroots effort to effect 
positive sustainability changes with our 
packaging. The team is actively investigating 
emerging technologies and ways to leverage 
more circular economy strategies in our 
packaging. They are championing conscious 
decision making about packaging materials 
based on recyclability, compostability, and the 
potential expansion of bio-based materials.

Contents     Overview     Good Food     Responsible Sourcing      Better Planet     Stronger Communities      About this ReportCorporate Ethics
At Conagra Brands, we prioritize ethics and 
integrity first in conducting our business. Integrity 
is the first of our Timeless Values. For us, it means 
complying with all legal requirements as well as 
our own defined set of standards, requirements 
and commitments to ethical behavior.
We believe that everyone involved with Conagra 
Brands—whether an employee, customer or 
supplier—deserves to be working for, working with 
and buying from a company that does the right 
thing, every day. We also believe that integrity 
is the foundation for our continued, meaningful 
and sustainable success. For these reasons, we 
strive to always operate in accordance with the 
highest ethical standards, our charter documents, 
applicable laws and stakeholder interests. 
Our Management Approach 
We recognize that the first step towards winning 
in the right way is ensuring that employees 
understand their role in acting and leading with 
integrity. Everyone must know and understand 
what is required of them—things like ensuring the 
safety of our people, our foods and our brands, 
integrity-based decision making, appropriate 
workplace conduct, responsible management of 
corporate resources, and protecting intellectual 
property, privacy, and confidentiality. 
There are no shortcuts in doing the right things 
and doing things right. To maintain a high integrity 
culture, Conagra Brands has invested in a network 
of compliance subject matter experts who support, manage and enforce our policies, including our 
Code of Conduct. Our cross-functional team 
brings an enterprise-wide view to our compliance 
activities throughout the organization. 
Our commitment to integrity goes far beyond 
our compliance experts. Every representative of 
Conagra Brands plays a pivotal role in building 
and maintaining a culture of integrity. Our people 
managers are responsible for creating and 
fostering the right behaviors within their teams by 
demonstrating our Timeless Values both in actions 
and words. This means ensuring an understanding 
of the requirements in our Code of Conduct, as well 
as policies specific to individual day-to-day activities 
and situations. We have policies relating to travel 
and entertainment, accounting matters, conflicts of 
interest, confidentiality, electronic communications, 
insider trading, as well as many other situations.
In addition, all employees are responsible for 
holding others accountable for their behavior 
and immediately addressing actions that do 
not comply with our Code of Conduct and 
other corporate requirements. Employees are 
encouraged and empowered to bring their 
questions or concerns to their managers, our 
Legal and Government Affairs department, and/
or the Audit/Finance Committee of the Board of 
Directors. Employees are also encouraged to raise 
concerns through our third-party ethics hotline 
866.567.CODE (2633), which allows employees 
to anonymously report concerns and alleged 
violations—always without risk of retaliation. 
Training plays a key role too. All new employees are required to take a course on our Code of 
Conduct as part of their onboarding process. In 
addition, we conduct regular training to ensure 
that employees are aware of our expectations 
and their obligations under the Code of Conduct. 
We expanded our anti-corruption training this 
year through an enterprise-wide, online anti-
corruption training campaign, targeting salaried 
employees worldwide, which we completed in 
June 2018; and through in-person, advanced anti-
corruption training with senior leadership team 
and their direct reports, Global Markets, finance 
leadership, and internal audit along with personnel 
in Canada and India. We also scheduled in-person 
advanced anti-corruption training focused on 
market-specific risks with China expansion team 
members, which will take place in fiscal year 2019.  
Conagra Brands continuously seeks opportunities 
to enhance our approach to corporate ethics, 
integrity and other aspects of our compliance 
programs and initiatives. We regularly benchmark 
with peers (informally and formally) to seek best 
practices, engage with our external auditors, 
and seek regulatory guidance to inform and 
monitor our efforts. We use all of the information 
we obtain, including during our regular cadence 
of ethics and compliance activities (conflict of 
interest certifications, analytics, and feedback 
submitted to our hotline and during trainings), 
to enhance and refine our efforts and programs. 
We did not make any significant changes to our 
management approach during fiscal year 2018.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct establishes principles 
and guidelines for working at Conagra Brands, 
specifying the basic requirements and expectations 
for putting integrity first. The Code of Conduct 
provides guideposts for how all of our employees 
and directors must conduct themselves when 
representing Conagra Brands both inside and 
outside the workplace. We also expect contractors, 
consultants, trainees, temps/agency workers, interns 
and volunteers, to follow our Code of Conduct. 
Other service providers and suppliers must act 
ethically and in a manner consistent with our Code 
of Conduct and other contract requirements. 
Our Code of Conduct codifies the legal and ethical 
standards for conducting business, for managing 
our employees, and for interacting with consumers, 
suppliers, customers, communities, and government 
officials. It also guides our environmental practices 
and reminds us of our duty and obligation to abide 
by all laws and regulations to protect our shared 
natural resources and to minimize any negative 
impacts. It is intended to foster open dialogue 
about decisions facing us in our day-to-day work. 
As a company, we hold ourselves accountable for 
upholding and enforcing our Code of Conduct. 
Our board of directors approved the code, and 
overall administration is handled by our Vice 
President of Internal Audit and our Vice President 
and Chief Employment Counsel. The day-to-
day administration of our Code of Conduct 
is managed by our local management teams. 
Matters relating to our Code of Conduct are 
routinely reported to the Audit/Finance Committee, which oversees the code at the highest level and 
designates appropriate personnel to determine 
remedial actions in the event of a violation.
In addition, we require that our chief 
executive officer, chief financial officer, and 
controller comply with a separate Code of 
Ethics for Senior Corporate Officers.
Ethical Employment Practices
Conagra Brands prohibits the use of any forced or 
compulsory labor, including human trafficking and 
slavery, in all of our operations. Any work performed 
by an employee or other individual that is involuntary 
and/or performed under the threat of physical harm 
or other penalty is strictly prohibited. Conagra 
Brands also complies with state and federal child labor laws through our hiring policies and human 
resources practices. Our standard entry-level 
wage is equal to—and often exceeds—the local 
minimum wage in locales in which we operate.
To the extent any employee objects to his or her 
terms and/or conditions of employment or sees 
anything else of concern, he or she may raise a 
complaint to his or her manager, a member of the 
Legal and Government Affairs department, and/or 
through our third-party ethics hotline 866.567.CODE 
(2633), or may leave the company at any time. 
Conagra Brands takes seriously all reports made 
through our ethics hotline and ensures that all are 
investigated properly. We have a strict non-retaliation 
policy for all good faith reports made through all 
reporting channels, including our ethics hotline.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Employee  
Health & Safety
Providing a safe work environment for our 
employees is a top priority at Conagra Brands. 
We are fully committed to maintaining a safe work 
environment, because we recognize that our 
employees are our greatest asset. This commitment 
to employee health and safety is unequivocal. All of 
our occupational safety and health efforts are rooted 
in the following core beliefs, or principles of safety:
 Principles of Safety
 Safety and health can be managed 
 Every workplace injury/illness could 
and should have been prevented 
 Management is responsible for 
providing a safe workplace 
 Safety and health are everyone’s responsibility 
 Nothing we do is worth getting hurt over  
Our Management Approach 
Our stated Principles of Safety reflect a shared 
commitment. As we strive to achieve an injury-free 
workplace, we are focused on maintaining a strong 
culture of safety, in which all employees commit 
to protecting themselves and their colleagues. 
The safety culture at our company is driven by 
engaged employees who have established a 
foundation, or discipline, of safe practices. This 
discipline includes several key concepts of safety:  
Key Concepts of Safety
 Leadership 
 Worker participation
 Compliance 
 Behavioral safety and other safe practices 
 Hazard identification and assessment
 Continuous skills development 
through education and training
 Performance Tracking 
 Continuous Improvement Several initiatives provide employees with 
opportunities to actively participate in implementing 
our safety processes. These include inspections 
and behavioral observations, as well as leading 
safety training and safety reminder discussions 
during pre-shift huddle meetings. In addition, 
every facility develops an annual Environment, 
Health & Safety Improvement Plan (EHSIP) to 
define site-specific health and safety priorities. 
In addition, our health and safety team audits 
each of our facilities every two years to ensure 
compliance with safety regulations and corporate 
policies. The team documents the audit results 
and tracks corrective actions to ensure we hold 
ourselves accountable for providing a safe work 
environment. As follow-up to any workplace injury 
or illness (an “incident”) or near miss, we require 
a thorough investigation to identify and address 
the root cause. We provide the best possible 
medical care to injured employees, while taking 
appropriate actions to correct identified hazards. 
By applying lessons learned, we seek to reduce the 
possibility of similar incidents happening again.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018More Than  
Just Numbers 
As a company, we take to heart exactly what our 
safety metrics represent—the health, well-being and 
lives of our employees. During fiscal year 2018, our 
Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) 
Incident Rate (OIR) decreased seven percent from 
the previous year. The OIR was 1.68 incidents per  
100 full-time workers, which is below the industry 
average of 4.71 for companies of our size, as 
reported by the U.S. Department of Labor for 2016.
OHSA conducts periodic inspections of facilities, 
especially those which have a higher historic rate  
of injuries. Because of our low incidence rate, there  
was a 20 percent reduction in the number of OSHA 
inspections. In fiscal year 2018, OSHA inspected 
eight Conagra Brands facilities, with each inspection 
resulting in only minor citations.
We are tirelessly working to build a strong 
foundation of safety in all our facilities through 
leadership, accountability and teamwork instilled 
through our proven Key Concepts of Safety. 
Based on our commitment and efforts, we 
are optimistic that we will achieve continued 
performance improvement during fiscal year 2019.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Facility Highlights  
 
Oakdale, Calif. 
The Oakdale grocery foods 
facility made a significant 
turnaround in its safety performance in fiscal 
year 2018, reducing work-related injuries by 47 
percent and lowering the OIR from 3.5 to 1.9 while 
working 1.1 million hours. This achievement can 
be attributed to activities that increased employee 
involvement in overall safety efforts including: 
 Daily safety walks through the plant
 Employee-based safety behavior audits 
with semi-weekly reporting and feedback
 Revitalized safety team organization
 Enhanced training program for new 
hires and seasonal workersCouncil Bluffs, Iowa
One of Conagra’s largest 
frozen food facilities has 
worked more than 3.6 million hours in fiscal years 
2017 and 2018 combined. Their OIR over the 
same period was 0.76. The Council Bluffs safety 
team continuously looks for different activities to 
increase the involvement and engagement of all site 
employees. All employees are expected to conduct 
peer-to-peer safety observations, which are tracked 
daily at onsite meetings and the team also leverages 
leadership coaching on the floor to conduct focused 
safety surveys, which serve to drive awareness 
and obtain employee feedback. Collectively, these 
activities are fostering a safety culture where 
associates value safety for all site employees.Rensselaer, Ind. 
Conagra Brands in Rensselaer, 
Indiana finished fiscal year 
2018 with its second back-to-back year with a 
zero OIR. This was accomplished with 482,856 
employee hours worked. The facility also continued 
their record of no Lost-Time Accidents (LTAs) 
since its opening in 1994. This success can be 
attributed to the application of High Performance 
Organization (HPO) and Conagra Performance 
System (CPS) principles to increase employee 
engagement and strengthen their ownership 
of Conagra’s safety management system.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Culture & Workplace: The Conagra Experience
We take pride in our culture—the most energized, 
high-impact culture in the food industry. We 
call it the Conagra Experience—a culture that 
supports and enables our six Timeless Values: 
 Integrity: Doing the right things 
and doing things right 
 External focus: Centering on the consumer, 
customer, competitor and investor 
 Broad-mindedness: Rejecting silos 
and embracing disciplined curiosity 
 Agility: Converting insights into action 
with the speed of an entrepreneur 
 Leadership by all: Simplifying, 
making decisions, inspiring others, 
and acting like an owner 
 Focus on results: Leveraging a “refuse-to-
lose” obsession with impact and value creation
The Conagra Experience is both our employee 
value proposition (what we offer) and our people 
philosophy (how we take care of our people). We 
hire people who reflect a diversity of backgrounds 
and talents and bring an energy and passion for 
delivering exceptional results and making an impact.
Our employees are more than resources; they are 
the driving force behind our success. Therefore, we 
invest in them, their growth, success and overall 
wellbeing. This investment fuels our employees 
and Conagra Brands, and also supports the many 
others that count on us every day, including our 
customers, consumers, communities, and investors.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Our Management Approach 
We work strategically to hire, develop and support 
leaders at every level. Those who are decisive, 
inspire others and take ownership of strong results 
will experience career growth directly aligned 
with their contributions. We provide the tools and 
information for all employees, regardless of role, to 
make direct connections between themselves, the 
work they do and our collective success. We expect 
all employees to take a vested interest in their own 
professional development through comprehensive 
planning, goal setting and reaching specific 
achievements. We believe in, encourage and directly 
support a “refuse-to-lose” attitude with an emphasis 
on making an impact and exceeding expectations. 
We also make a simple promise to our employees–
as they continue to contribute directly to the 
company’s success, we invest in relevant programs 
and rewards to help them be their best in all 
areas–from their health and wealth, to growth and 
balance. It’s what we call the Conagra Experience.
Our health offerings go beyond medical or vision 
benefits to include support for total wellness. 
We provide programs to support employees 
with their individual wealth through life insurance 
and retirement savings, and also with financial 
coaching. We offer several personal and professional 
growth opportunities that include performance 
management and learning programs, and we 
support our employees’ ability to balance work and 
life through enriching experiences and paid time off. Coaching

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Learning & Development
The Conagra Experience includes providing 
development opportunities for all employees to 
support their continuous growth. At Conagra, 
employees own their career paths, managers enable 
them, and the talent development function provides 
modern resources and tools to make it happen. 
Our leaders are committed to developing 
employees through experiences, understanding 
that learning happens all the time, everywhere. 
Comprehensive onboarding, experience maps, our 
talent management process, mentoring programs, formal learning and on-demand resources (like 
LinkedIn Learning for all salaried employees) are 
just some examples of how we bring this to life.
We focus on providing challenging and rewarding 
work, developmental relationships, and formal 
coursework and research—all tailored to the specific 
needs of our employees. We also maintain online 
libraries that feature relevant, curated content 
from internal and external resources, which can 
be customized for our employees unique needs. We provide tools for each learner and business 
unit to customize their development experiences 
through courseware, technology and consultation. 
In addition, we emphasize continuous skill 
development, with learning options that extend 
beyond individual employee roles at the company. 
Employees are able to develop the skills that they 
choose to support their careers and their outside 
passions. We facilitate their ongoing development 
efforts through exchanges with other functions and 
easy access to courseware and technologies.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Diversity & Inclusion
At Conagra Brands, we know that having a 
diverse and inclusive organization creates a 
competitive advantage for us and is essential 
to the growth and evolution of our Company. 
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) is about much 
more than race, gender and sexual orientation. 
It is about who we are and, therefore, will 
never be a standalone initiative, program or 
priority for us. It is an internal drive that ingrains 
diversity of perspectives, inclusion, belonging, 
and equity into our employees’ DNA and all of 
their day-to-day actions and interactions. D&I 
also inspires our drive to ensure that who we 
have at the table—from our offices, facilities, 
and supplier pool—represents the diverse 
communities and consumers that we feed daily. 
WE DELIBERATELY INTEGRATE D&I 
INTO THE CONAGRA EXPERIENCE 
FOR THREE PURPOSES: 
Growing the Conagra Business
By harnessing the power of D&I  
to accelerate innovative solutions
Building Culture 
By strengthening D&I awareness, cultural 
competencies and cultural ownership 
Strengthening our Workforce 
By increasing representation of diverse talent  
at all levels through recruitment and retentionOur efforts are consistent with, and go beyond, 
the principles of equal employment opportunity 
and affirmative action planning to continuously 
transform the workplace and individual behaviors. 
We emphasize cultural competence, ownership 
and acceptance, and encourage people to 
be authentic and freely express their ideas. In 
addition, we expect every employee to treat others 
equitably and with respect, which helps to foster 
a sense of belonging and accelerate innovation. 
All of our efforts support the CEO Action for Diversity 
& Inclusion™ Pledge, which Conagra Brands signed 
when it launched in June 2017. We operationalize 
this pledge through various activities throughout 
our organization. Workshops and other training 
programs, town hall meetings, and large events 
are all conducted by a combination of our human 
resources staff, employee resource groups, and 
third-party vendors. Some activities focus on helping 
employees identify unconscious biases, the negative 
effects of biases, and ways to “own” cultural 
competence and inclusiveness. Others impart very 
specific, practical ways to improve interactions, 
for example, when interviewing job candidates 
and conducting employee performance reviews. 
Most important, everyone in the organization 
owns our commitment to D&I, from our senior 
leaders and executive sponsors to individual 
contributors, employee resource groups, and 
colleagues in the field and at our facilities.
Contents     Overview     Good Food     Responsible Sourcing     Better Planet     Stronger Communities      About this ReportEmployee Resource Groups
We are particularly proud of our Employee Resource 
Groups (ERGs) and foster their leadership in 
supporting a diverse and inclusive culture. The seven 
employee groups bring together employees from a 
variety of cultures, backgrounds and lifestyles and 
receive support from executive sponsors to guide 
members’ personal and professional development. 
The ERGs are D&I influencers that support 
our D&I efforts through three key focus areas: 
diversity recruitment, inclusive workplace 
and community partnerships. They provide a 
forum for learning and exchanging of ideas; 
drive engagement; develop employee leaders; 
and position Conagra Brands as a place for 
diverse talent and a voice in the community. DIVERSITY RECRUITMENT

 We cannot overstate the benefits of our ERGs’ 
support for employees, our business and 
communities. Take a look at the ERGs and a few 
highlights of their many activities this year:
Conagra Asian Network (CAN)
CAN shares Asian cultures and celebrates them. 
There are so many Asian cultures in the world and 
so many represented by our employees, that CAN 
chooses two or three cultures to highlight each 
year. This year, CAN highlighted Chinese New Year 
and International Yoga Day, as well as honoring 
Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. The group 
also established a networking relationship with the 
Asian employee resource group at McDonald’s.
Conagra Black Employee Network (CBEN)
CBEN builds community within our company and 
connects with local communities, primarily in 
Omaha and Chicago. This year, CBEN organized 
events for Black History Month, led participation 
in Omaha North Magnet High School’s first 
African American Professionals Day, and 
rallied CBEN members to support Completely 
KIDS with backpack meals and kickball.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Conagra Latino Leadership Network (CLN)
CLN represents and celebrates Latino people 
and cultures through lunch & learns, holiday 
celebrations and volunteerism. The group’s events 
this year included cooking events featuring our 
Frontera® and Rosarita® brands, volunteering 
with children of the South Omaha Boys and Girls 
Club, and student mentoring students through 
the Chicago chapter of Junior Achievement.LGBT+Ally Conagra Brands Lesbian,  
Gay, Bi-Sexual & Transgender Network
The LGBT+Ally Network supports community 
engagement and awareness. This year, the 
network supported community programs and 
LGBT Pride Month events, plus expanded our 
holiday giving tree campaign, which generated 
our all-time best participation! The network also 
helped all of us celebrate Conagra Brands’ 100 
percent rating on the Human Rights Campaign 
Corporate Equality Index. 2018 marked the 
fourth consecutive year of our perfect score!
Conagra Veterans Network (CVN)
CVN focuses on educational outreach and 
events. CVN programs, such as this year’s 
desk drops for Veterans Day and Memorial 
Day, and TV appearance, serve to honor 
veterans and answer questions that civilians 
might have about veterans and the military.Conagra Women’s Network (CWN)
CWN supports and celebrates women. CWN 
conducts discussion groups and other professional 
development events every year, with multiple 
sub-groups focusing on individual topics, such as 
“Parents in Business” and “Women in Technology.” 
CWN also facilitates volunteerism opportunities, 
including during Women’s History Month. 
Conagra Young Professionals Network (YPN)
YPN supports young professionals and their careers. 
The network conducts an ongoing speaker series, 
mentorship program, food-focused education 
events and book club. This year, YPN also sent 
30 young professionals to a one-day summit in 
Omaha (1500 people where there!) and is piloting 
a podcast geared toward young professionals.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Supplier Diversity
Our commitment to diversity extends to 
our supplier relationships. Working with 
diverse businesses is important for bringing 
value, imagination, and innovation to our 
customers, consumers, and communities.
We actively pursue contracts with minority, 
women and veteran-owned companies. During 
fiscal year 2018, we spent more than $326 
million with more than 850 minority, women 
and veteran-owned businesses across all 
procurement categories and business units. 
This year, we enhanced our focus on supplier 
diversity in notable ways. At our annual Supplier 
Excellence Summit in August 2018, we awarded 
our first-ever Supplier Diversity award to a supplier 
that demonstrated community outreach, reported 
tier 2 diversity spend in all of the required quarters, 
and is a major player in advocacy groups. In 
addition, we changed our Supplier Excellence 
scorecard for fiscal year 2019. Going forward, our 
top suppliers will need to report tier 2 diversity 
spend, and we will award additional points to 
suppliers that participate in advocacy groups 
and have community outreach programs. 
Conagra Brands also actively partners with 
development and advocacy organizations near 
our operating locations in the U.S. These include 
minority, women and veteran development 
organizations, business accelerator programs and 
incubators, community and industry innovation 
networks, and chambers of commerce. Our involvement with the Mountain Plains Minority 
Supplier Development Council (MPMSDC) is 
particularly strong. Since 2014, Conagra Brands 
has been an active member of MPMSDC, helping 
to support the organization’s mission of providing 
companies and government entities with greater 
access to the goods and services of minority-owned 
business to develop lasting and mutually beneficial 
relationships. Our Chief Procurement Officer sits on 
the board of directors of MPMSDC, plus we attend 
(and often host) quarterly roundtables facilitated by 
the leadership team. This year, we hosted an event 
to spotlight Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs), which enabled four Omaha-area MBE’s to tell their 
story to MPMSDC members and Conagra Brands 
professionals. Through our participation in MPMSDC 
and similar forums, we learn from industry peers 
and others, share our insights, and continuously 
strengthen our supplier diversity efforts.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Community Impact & Philanthropy
We believe that everybody has the right to good food. Food to nourish bodies and minds. Food to help celebrate or bring comfort. Food to provide 
energy for a big day on the job or to do evening homework. Food that is reliably accessible every single day. Unfortunately, millions of Americans across 
the country—adults and children alike—live in food insecure households; they do not have reliable access to affordable and nutritious food.
 
Our Management Approach  
As a leading food company, we remain deeply 
motivated to using our resources to make a 
meaningful impact on the pervasive societal 
issue of hunger. To help combat food insecurity, 
we take a leading role to engage our employees, 
partner with local and national nonprofits, and 
inspire others to ensure people have access to 
the food they need to reach their full potential.
Impacting food insecurity requires a holistic 
approach, and our work includes volunteerism, 
product donations, and financial contributions 
—volunteerism by our employees, who tirelessly 
donate their time, professional skills, and funds 
to improve their communities; product donations 
by our company, which have the added benefit 
of stocking pantry shelves while eliminating 
wasted food; and financial contributions by our 
philanthropic arm, the Conagra Brands Foundation, 
to nonprofits in communities where we operate. 
The Conagra Brands Foundation is proud to serve 
our neighbors by making grants to nonprofit partners 
across the country that provide children, teenagers, 
adults, and senior citizens with highly effective 
programs that are aligned with our core focus areas: 
 Food Access: ensuring that people are 
able to get healthy, nutritious foods on a 
dependable basis, whether at food pantries, 
mobile sites, congregate meals, or more.  Healthy Cooking: introducing people to 
new recipes or innovative cooking methods 
to help them get excited about preparing 
flavorful, wholesome meals or snacks. 
 Nutrition Education: helping people 
understand food and make healthy 
choices when planning, shopping, 
cooking, and dining out. 
 Healthy and Active Lifestyles: encouraging 
people to incorporate activities and foods 
that help fuel busy modern lives. 
 Urban Agriculture: increasing 
community access to fresh produce 
grown locally, to spark interest in healthy 
meal preparation and snacking. 
Our efforts are primarily community-focused in 
order to increase our impact in the areas where our 
employees live and work. While we have maintained 
some previously-established national partnerships, 
we have also reemphasized the importance of 
working directly with local organizations and have 
funded nonprofits that teach healthy cooking skills 
to young people, plant urban gardens in food 
deserts, serve congregate meals to veterans and 
seniors, and more. We also partner with Feeding 
America to support and strengthen its network 
of food banks, and to efficiently donate excess 
finished products and raw ingredients through 
its network to stock pantry shelves while also 
greatly reducing the possibility of food ending up in landfills. We are committed to building 
a community-based approach balanced with 
necessary attention to the national landscape, 
in order to understand and stay connected to 
our peers and partners which are working to 
combat food insecurity across the country. 
This report highlights some of our key initiatives 
and celebrates our effective nonprofit partners 
and committed employees. Together, with 
our employees and nonprofit partners, we are 
working to achieve food security in the many 
communities where we live and work—from 
Chicago to Council Bluffs, Omaha to Indianapolis, 
Marshall to Menomonie, and beyond.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Volunteerism
Month of Service 2018 
Every April, Conagra Brands and its employees unite 
through the collective spirit of volunteerism in our 
annual Month of Service, providing the opportunity 
for colleagues around the world to give back and 
make a difference in our own backyards. Conagra 
employees get a new perspective on meaningful 
causes including hunger, nutrition, food insecurity, 
and access to healthy food, all while connecting with 
each other and reinforcing our core values of integrity, 
external focus, and leadership. This April, a total of 
2,284 employees engaged in 117 projects throughout 
18 states and five countries, and provided 5,578 
volunteer hours. Our activities generated the equivalent 
of 639,169 meals for people facing food insecurity 
across the country. From packing cabbage and 
potatoes at foodbanks, to preparing meals for those 
in need, to stuffing backpacks with food for children, 
it was an overwhelming and inspiring success! 
Conagra employees’ commitment to volunteering 
extends beyond the month of April. Each year 
employees give thousands of hours of their time to 
local causes about which they are passionate; one 
such example is the Greater Chicago Food Depository 
(GCFD). Located near our headquarters in Chicago 
and with direct programs that are eradicating hunger, 
GCFD is a natural fit for employee volunteers. 
Conagra employees give hundreds of hours each year 
packing up food for our neighbors. These efforts are 
supplemented through Conagra Brands Foundation’s 
support of GCFD programs, such as the Healthy 
Student Markets program which helps alleviate food 
insecurity among college students through increased 
access to nutritious food on college campuses.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Partnership Spotlight: Feeding America
Between 2015–2017, Conagra Brands Foundation invested $10M in Feeding America, the nation’s leading hunger relief nonprofit. Conagra Brands Foundation  
has funded programs to improve access to nutritious food; research to bolster the impact on vulnerable populations; and local grants to increase the capacity  
of a network of 200 food banks across the nation to feed our communities. Also between 2015–2017, Conagra Brands donated 90.1 million pounds of food 
distributed via the Feeding America network. 
 
Hunger-Free Summer Grants
 
Conagra Brands Foundation’s signature hunger-
relief program for the past eight years has been 
the Hunger-Free Summer Grants initiative, which 
supports local food banks across the nation 
in assisting the more than 18 million children 
who go hungry in the summer months when 
school is not in session. Our work particularly 
focuses on piloting sustainable program models 
like congregate meal sites, school pantries, 
and mobile distributions that can potentially be 
replicated across the Feeding America network. 
The 2017 Conagra Brands Foundation Hunger-
Free Summer Grant funded cutting-edge summer 
programming for kids through 25 food banks across 
15 states. Each of the participating food banks 
made large strides in our collective effort to close the 
summer meal gap for children in need. Significantly, 
funding from Conagra Brands Foundation supported 
Feeding America’s Child Hunger Strategy with 
summer programs that have a specific focus on 
serving households with children (and their parents/
guardians), as well as underserved communities. 
Outcomes at grant-funded locations include 
247 sites operated, with at least 10,402 
individual children and 705,451 meals served. 
(Overall, summer programs around the country 
distributed an estimated 3.9 million meals.)   SEVEN TRENDS FOR SUCCESS 
STOOD OUT IN SUMMER 2017: 
1 Incorporating fresh produce distributions 
2  Engaging youth as volunteers 
or site employees 
3 Serving rural families 
4 Leveraging mobile models 
5  Providing adult meals at Summer  
Food Service Program (SFSP) sites 
6 Maximizing community partnerships 
7 Utilizing housing complexes as sites 
 
Thanks to multi-year funding from the Foundation, 
Feeding America hosted the “Summer Isn’t 
Fun When You’re Hungry” PSA campaign, and 
provided the opportunity for food banks to 
opt-in to the campaign as well as to receive 
summer banners and post cards to publicize 
their summer feeding sites; 112 food banks 
opted in to be included in the PSA materials, 
and 107 ordered banners and/or postcards.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Hunger-Free Summer Hubs 
 
Operating successful summer feeding programs 
can be challenging; the most effective programs 
involve stable, multifaceted partnerships that 
engage social service agencies, schools, 
churches, community organizations, and/
or other local leaders that are committed to 
improving the well-being of their young citizens. 
In addition to the Hunger-Free Summer Grants 
described above, Conagra Brands Foundation 
invested in three food banks for three years 
(2015–2017) to build out Hunger-Free Summer 
Hubs. The three-year project required food 
banks to evaluate their current local summer 
feeding landscape through a needs assessment. 
Based on those findings, they leveraged local 
partnerships to implement holistic programs 
and services that increase access to summer 
meals for children and their families. 
The three food banks chosen were: 
 St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance, 
Northern Arizona counties 
 Lowcountry Food Bank, North 
Charleston, South Carolina 
 Freestore Food Bank, CincinnatiAll food banks experienced a substantial  
increase in summer meal growth 
over the past three years:* 
This successful increase in meal distribution  
can be attributed to several key approaches: 
 Increasing the number and diversity of 
partnerships within communities led to 
a decrease in duplication of services 
 Increasing awareness of summer programs 
and resources available to households 
with children through the creation and 
dissemination of targeted outreach/messaging 
 Decreasing barriers to participation

Hunger Research  
MAP THE MEAL GAP 2018 
The Foundation supported Feeding America’s 
annual study on the cost of food and food insecurity 
at both the county and congressional district level 
in the United States. This critical study finds that 
food-insecure individuals now face, on average, 
a food budget shortfall of $509.70 per person 
per year. Accounting for the many millions of 
Americans who are food insecure, this equates a 
$21B food budget shortfall. This rising measure 
of need suggests that people facing hunger are 
likely falling further behind as they continue to 
struggle to buy enough food to meet their needs. 
BRINGING TEENS TO THE TABLE AND 
IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES: TEENS AND 
FOOD INSECURITY IN AMERICA 
While there is significant literature on food insecurity 
and children, most of this research has focused 
on the risks to and impact on children under age 
6. These reports reveal that low-income teens are 
aware of their parents’ struggles and often share 
in their worries and efforts to protect the youngest 
and most vulnerable members of the household 
by shielding younger siblings from hunger.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Hunger Action Month
We partner with Feeding America every September 
as part of its nationwide Hunger Action Month, 
a campaign designed to mobilize the public to 
take action on the issue of hunger. This year, 
employees participated in a paper plate project 
giving a voice to the millions of people who face 
hunger every day, and were encouraged to get 
involved to make a difference. We also “turned 
orange” to further raise awareness. From wearing 
orange (the color most commonly associated with 
hunger awareness) to dying the fountain in Omaha 
orange and partnering with the Merchandise Mart 
in Chicago to illuminate its building facade, to 
turning brand social feeds orange to show that 
fighting hunger is a company-wide priority, Conagra 
employees and our many brands helped generate 
significant awareness on the issue of hunger.Capacity Building and 
Leadership Development 
Another example of investing in innovation is 
found in the Conagra Brands Foundation Child 
Hunger Corps. It is a national service program 
that deploys college graduates to food banks for 
two years to implement new, or expand existing, 
child programming. The Foundation funded a total 
of six cohorts of Corps members, resulting in the 
significant increase of 42,189 additional annual 
meals provided to children in need in comparison 
to non-host food banks in the network. They 
also helped increase the number and diversity of 
community partnerships at host food banks. 
 
 Fight Hunger Spark Change
Conagra Brands was proud to support Walmart 
and Feeding America’s Fight Hunger Spark 
Change initiative. Consumers who purchased 
specially marked products—such as select Chef 
Boyardee,® Banquet,® Manwich,® RO*TEL,® and 
Orville Redenbacher’s® products—helped secure 
meals for food insecure individuals. Our brands 
helped raise $1 million to support this effort.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Program Spotlight: Shine the Light on Hunger
This year marked the 
11th anniversary of our 
annual Shine the Light on 
Hunger campaign. This 
annual program highlights 
Conagra’s holistic approach to combating food 
insecurity with varied opportunities for employee 
and company involvement. This family friendly, 
community-wide call to action, advocacy, and 
education raises awareness and funds to support 
food access programs throughout Omaha and 
surrounding areas with the goal of raising the 
equivalent of 1.4 million meals. To achieve a goal 
of this magnitude requires the involvement of the 
entire community, which has grown in support and 
participation each year. The community achieved 
the goal by enjoying the campaign’s now-iconic 
ice rink; making donations of non-perishable 
food items at partner locations around town; and 
contributing directly to Food Bank for the Heartland. 
The Conagra Brands Foundation matched these 
donations dollar-for-dollar up to $100,000. 
Conagra Brands employees also stepped up to 
rally around this campaign. On Dec. 5, our very 
own culinary team—along with over 80 employees 
—personally planned, shopped, prepared, 
cooked, and served over 1,500 hearty dinners

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Financial Contributions
The Conagra Brands Foundation provides contributions to communities across the country, through community impact grants, as well as national and local 
partnerships. To be considered for grant support, Conagra Brands Foundation invites U.S.-based nonprofit organizations to submit online letter of intent (LOI), 
which must strategically align with our core areas of focus. These include food access, nutrition education, cooking skills, healthy and active lifestyles and select 
urban agricultural programs that have a clear community focus and provide entrepreneurial skills to help individuals participate in the farm-to-fork economy. 
Preference is given to highly effective nonprofits with high-impact projects that occur in and near the communities where our employees live and work.
Nourish Our Community Grants 
Conagra Brands encourages its employees to nominate 
nonprofits in their community to be considered for a one-year 
grant through the Nourish Our Community program. This 
year, the employee review committee awarded $300,000 in 
total, which was distributed to 17 nonprofit organization in 
12 states (Ark., Iowa, Ill., Ky., Mich., Minn., Neb., Ohio, Pa., 
Tenn., Texas, Wis.). This program has a direct impact on the 
communities where our employees live and work by funding 
effective local programs that address food insecurity, nutrition 
education, cooking skills, healthy and active lifestyles, and 
select urban agriculture programs. Conagra employees play 
a pivotal role in the success of this program, as employees 
nominate the nonprofit organizations, discuss the merits of 
each application, and ultimately make the final grant decisions. 
Descriptions of some of the funded programs are included here.
Alpha Community Center (Ohio)
PROJECT: ALPHAMEALS
The Nourish Our Community grant will help 
Alpha Community Center provide nutritious 
and hearty hot lunches to over 10,000 people

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Product Donations and Disaster Relief
Product donations made directly by Conagra Brands 
are integral to our approach to food insecurity. We 
actively manage our product inventory and often 
act quickly to provide the food to Feeding America 
and its network of food banks. In fiscal year 2018 
Conagra Brands donated 13,409,142 pounds of 
product to Feeding America, which means that 
on average, Conagra Brands donated more than 
1 million pounds of product per month to Feeding 
America Food Banks. Additionally, employee-driven 
product donations occur alongside many of our 
annual philanthropy initiatives such as Shine the 
Light on Hunger and our United Way Campaign. Product donations are also made when disaster 
strikes, especially within the communities 
where our employees live and work. In 
fiscal year 2018, Conagra worked with local 
nonprofits and provided hundreds of thousands 
of pounds of product donations in Texas, 
Florida, Georgia, Puerto Rico and Mexico to 
support those impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, 
and Irma and the Mexico Earthquake.
In response to Hurricane Maria, the Foundation 
made monetary donations to Feeding America 
and the United Way, and 25,000 pounds of 
food was provided immediately after the storm. 
The Conagra Global Markets team secured an 
additional 150,000 pounds, which was delivered 
in November 2017 and was distributed by our 
local relief partner, Second Harvest of Puerto Rico, 
which is the local affiliate of Feeding America.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Material Topics, Risks & Opportunities
 
MATERIAL TOPICS RISKS OPPORTUNITIES
CSR Governance Business integration from M&A and divestitures is a persistent 
need in the food industry. These integrations can bring 
transparency challenges, inherited social and environmental risks, 
uncoordinated CSR goals, policies and measurement systems.Our M&A teams and change management processes engage 
CSR leaders throughout the process to identify and manage 
risks and share best practices. Our approach to due diligence 
incorporates social and environmental considerations to 
minimize risks during business acquisitions and divestitures.
GOOD FOOD
Corporate Ethics Consumers, customers and investors increasingly expect 
large food companies to have positive impacts on people, 
planet and profit through responsible business practices and 
transparency. Organizations with poor citizenship reputations 
risk loss of investment and product market share.In addition to corporate-wide responsibility initiatives  
Conagra Brands’ four citizenship pillars of Good Food, Responsible 
Sourcing, Better Planet and Stronger Communities, we incorporate 
environmentally and socially responsible ingredients and materials 
at the product level to align product offerings with the consumers 
looking to support these topics through purchase behavior. 
Health and Nutrition Health care issues facing the population have increased the 
need to help consumers balance their desire to maintain or 
improve the nutrition profile of their overall diet with their food 
and taste preferences, busy lifestyles and household budgets. 
Consumer approaches to managing health today incorporate 
elements of “wellness,” which fall outside traditional definitions 
of nutrition and approaches to healthy products. If the food we 
make fails to keep pace with the interplay of these priorities, 
our business performance may be negatively impacted.To establish a competitive advantage in the marketplace, 
we integrate knowledge of consumer insights with nutrition 
science to make informed decisions about how to diversify 
our portfolio of foods to address the changing dynamics 
among nutrition, taste, cost and convenience.
Alternative Proteins Emerging eating patterns in America are showing increased 
interest in plant-forward, vegan, vegetarian and flexitarian lifestyles. 
Opportunities to reach consumers interested in these emerging 
eating patterns include alternative protein choices. Responding 
to demand requires scientific efforts to understand the health, life 
cycle environmental, economic and community impacts associated 
with moving from animal- to plant-based and lab-based proteins. Consumer preferences and demand are the core drivers for any 
new product innovation or renovation choices that we make. 
Our strategy for assessing and selecting alternative proteins is 
science and data driven, in consideration of both health and 
environmental impacts. We are guided by research on these 
considerations shared through the Food Forum of the National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and recognize 
that the benefits of alternative proteins are context-specific.

Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Food Safety 
and QualityAll food companies face the risk of product recalls, either 
directly linked to their manufacturing practices or as a 
result of using a contaminated ingredient from a supplier. 
Recalls can result in financial and reputational loss.By achieving Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certification 
at our manufacturing facilities and influencing third parties in 
our supply chain to do the same, we minimize the risk of recalls 
throughout the production life cycle of the food we make.
Product  
LabelingConsumers, customers and other stakeholders deserve 
accurate labeling of the ingredients and nutritional composition 
of the food we make. Inaccurate information erodes trust, 
is costly to correct, and has a negative impact on both 
short-term and long-term business performance.By focusing on continual improvement of the systems used to 
perform food labeling, the capability and expertise of the people 
using these systems, and detailed root cause analyses and 
corrective actions for errors when they occur, we increase the 
quality, efficiency and accuracy of our food labeling information.
RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
Agriculture Climate change, water risk and other environmental factors—
combined with a growing global population—present some of 
the greatest challenges that the food industry must address.Collaborating with suppliers and growers on sustainable 
agriculture opportunities will strengthen our relationships 
with these critical business partners and help ensure 
reliable sources of critical ingredients.
Transparency Increasingly complex supply chains present transparency challenges 
for managing environmental impacts and social risks such as 
child and forced labor, business ethics and non-discrimination.Suppliers engagement on priority ingredient provenance mapping, 
and emerging technologies for tracking goods globally present 
opportunities for measuring and managing procurement risks.
BETTER PLANET
Climate Change The physical, regulatory and reputational risks associated 
with climate change present risks to our operations, 
such as changing weather patterns affecting crop yields 
and regulatory costs related to carbon emissions.Improving energy and transportation efficiency and 
encouraging sustainable product and process innovation 
can reduce operating costs, improve our climate resiliency 
and limit the potential impact of greenhouse regulations.
Food Waste Approximately 40 percent of all food is wasted, and if disposed 
of in a landfill, creates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. 
Food waste also represents a critical loss of our ingredients.Finding every opportunity to reduce food waste is the key. 
We can do that in our systems through better practices 
and yield improvements, and for our consumers with better 
packaging and product innovation. We follow the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s (EPA) Food Waste Hierarchy to direct 
those materials to a better destination than a landfill: to feed 
people, feed animals, recover energy or make compost.
Contents     Overview     Good Food     Responsible Sourcing     Better Planet     Stronger Communities     About this Report
83
Conagra Brands Citizenship Report 2018Product  
Packaging Consumer demand for renewable packaging materials 
requires packaging design that meets consumer preferences 
while maintaining food safety and municipal infrastructure to 
sustainably dispose of those materials (e.g. industrial composting). 
Potential extended product responsibility (EPR) programs 
in the U.S. may change the business model around funding 
for the packaging recycling infrastructure and systems. While we continue to work to optimize our packaging through 
source reductions, use of renewable materials and increasing 
recycled content, we also recognize that packaging has a critical 
role to play in how we affect the issues of food waste and losses. 
Better packaging can reduce damage in transport and in stores 
and can also help food store longer, giving people more time to 
eat our food. Our opportunity is to make packaging work better 
to support the big picture, as well as use a life cycle approach 
to packaging material choices that considers sustainability from 
sourcing to disposal (change “disposal” to “end of life”).
Water Risk We rely on the availability of quality water resources 
to grow raw ingredients and process finished goods. 
Concern over water scarcity and increasingly stringent 
water quality regulations can affect operations.Progress toward our water use reduction goal will improve our 
operating efficiency and reduce company exposure to water-related 
risks. Sustainable sourcing policies for priority ingredients and 
materials mitigate water scarcity threats in our procurement chain.
E-Commerce The prevalence of e-commerce has increased transportation needs 
and environmental impacts associated with increased energy use, 
air emissions, and natural resources needed for infrastructure. 
Longer transit requires appropriate packaging to protect and 
preserve food, raising considerations about material use. Engagement with our transportation suppliers around vehicle 
efficiency and strategic use of multi-modal transport systems 
mitigates the environmental impacts of transportation. 
STRONGER COMMUNITIES
Employee 
DevelopmentEmployees may be lured away to other opportunities in a 
competitive job market if they don’t feel they have adequate 
professional development and career advancement 
opportunities. Under-investing in people may increase 
our turnover rate and hinder recruiting efforts.Investing in our employees’ professional development and 
celebrating their diversity improves employee satisfaction 
and retention and enhances our recruiting success.
Workplace Safety Unsafe working conditions lead to a high injury 
rate and poor employee satisfaction, increasing 
turnover and workers’ compensation costs.Improving workplace safety and encouraging safe working behaviors 
instills a safety-focused culture, reducing our injury rate and costs.
Community 
InvolvementManufacturing facilities risk being perceived as a burden on 
local communities or passive corporate citizens, putting a strain 
on natural resources. This can result in an impaired corporate 
reputation and an inability to attract and retain employees.A clearly defined social platform serves as the basis for our 
charitable contributions and community outreach, enhancing 
our reputation as a responsible corporate citizen.
