2 | FIFTH THIRD BANCORP 2020 ESG REPORTINTRODUCTION
A MESSAGE  
FROM THE 
CHAIRMAN & CEO
It’s an honor to publish Fifth Third’s 
second annual Environmental, Social 
and Governance Report for our 
stakeholders  . It’s a n opportunity to 
discuss the progress of our ESG efforts 
as well as to demonstrate the multiple 
ways we live our purpose to improve 
the lives of our customers and the well-
being of our communities  . For 163 years, spanning a Civil War, two 
world wars, 34 recessions (including the 
Great Depression), 10 banking crises, and 
two severe global pandemics, Fifth Third 
Bank has stood firmly with our customers,  
communities and employees. We always 
rise to the occasion to help others and be a 
source of value and trust, especially in the 
most challenging times  .
That’s why we continue to expand our 
voluntary reporting and increase the 
transparency of our ESG actions and impact 
by aligning to industry best practices , 
including the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (now Value Reporting 
Foundation), Global Reporting Initiative, 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures and World Economic Forum’s 
Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics  . In 202 0, we 
disclosed our ESG materiality assessment, 
which was informed by stakeholder feedback, 
and formalized our ESG Steering Group into 
the ESG Committee, which is comprised of 
leaders from across the Company  .
Addressing the COVID-19 pandemic has 
been a significant focus for Fifth Third  . For 
our customers, we kept 99% of our banking 
centers open and provided over $7.4 billion 
of Paycheck Protection Program loans to 
small businesse s, 26% of which helped low 
and moderate income communities  . We 
continued to employ over 20,000 people We have a 163-year 
history of helping others 
and being a source of 
value and trust for our 
customers, communities, 
employees and 
shareholders—and we will 
never stop doing what’s right for those we serve.
acr
oss our footprint and provided special 
payments of up to $1,000 to employees 
who provided frontline service during 
the crisis  . We als o expanded benefits for 
employees, including encouraging them to 
get vaccinated through wellness points and 
by giving them additional paid time off  . 
In the communities we serve, we took an 
active role in helping various local, state 
and national groups respond to COVID-19, 
including the Cincinnati USA Regional 
Chamber of Commerce’s RESTART task force  . 
We invested nearly $9 million in philanthropy 
from the Fifth Third Foundation to assist 
in relief, recovery and resiliency grants 
throughout our footprint  .

3 | FIFTH THIRD BANCORP 2020 ESG REPORT CONTENTS INTRODUCTION ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT INDEXINTRODUCTION
In June 2020, we established a new Executive 
Diversity Leadership Council  comprising senior 
and executive leaders from across the Company 
to ensure that the Bank’s inclusion and diversity 
efforts are not only an organizational priority 
but are grounded in the collective voices of 
our employees, customers and communities  . In 
December, we announced the Accelerating 
Racial Equality, Equity and Inclusion initiative, 
which includes a $2.8 billion commitment 
to communities  that will provide $2  .2 bil lion 
in lending, $500 million in investments, $60 
million in financial accessibility and $40 million 
in philanthropy  . We a lso announced our Board’s 
approval of six bold goals to support inclusion and diversity in our workforce, and we plan to 
achieve by 2025  . Mo re information about these 
commitments begins on page 57  .
We also delivered on an important prior 
commitment  . In 2020, we officially completed 
our five-year, $32 billion Community 
Commitment.  We exceeded our original 
commitment by approximately $9 billion, or 30%, 
as we delivered $41  .6 bil lion to invest in low- and 
moderate-income communities  . Ad ditionally, we 
delivered $378 million in impact programming  . These dollars represent a big impact in a small 
way—in the individual lives of the thousands 
of people helped and local communities 
strengthened  . Mo re about the Community 
Commitment can be found on page 84  .
We have also continued to demonstrate our 
leadership in environmental sustainability  . We 
became the first regional commercial bank to 
achieve carbon neutrality for our own operations 
in 2020. We also set a Company-wide sustainable 
financing goal of $8 billion to be achieved by 2025 
and are already two-thirds to that goal  . Ou r strong 
performance was again recognized by another 
leadership band score of A- by CDP, the only peer 
bank to earn the distinction in consecutive years  .
As we move forward into 2021, we continue 
to take leadership actions by supporting key 
sustainability initiatives.  In April, we joined the 
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials to 
further our commitment to measure certain client 
emissions through a common GHG accounting 
standard  . We a lso recently joined the Ceres 
Company Network, which gives us access to 
insight and guidance on how to best accelerate the 
transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy  . Taken together, all of this work headlined our 
ESG efforts in the past year and led to our being 
honored again by Ethisphere as one of the 
world’s most ethical companies, one of only 
five banks in the world to be recognized  . The 
recognition reflects our strong corporate culture, 
compliance program and ESG actions  . 
I invite you to continue reading this report to learn  
more about our commitment to be a top quartile 
ESG performing company among peers  . Ou r 
philosophy of doing well by doing good will continue  
to guide our ESG actions and ultimately lead to 
generating sustainable value for all our stakeholders  .
Together, we are working to be the One Bank 
people most value and trust. Thank you for your 
continued support.  
Sincerely,
Greg D. Carmichael
Chairman & CEO
June 2021 
We officially completed our five-year Community Commitment, 
delivering $41.6 billion and exceeding our original commitment 
by approximately $9 billion, or 30%.

UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT GOALS
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect 
the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere  . The 17 g oals were adopted by 
all UN member states in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which set out a 
15-year plan to achieve the goals  .
At Fifth Third, we believe we have a role to play in all 17 UN goals. However, we have identified 12 
that align especially well with our ESG priorities. We have formulated strategies and actions to make 
progress on these 12 goals:

Introduction of new products as well as 
product expansions and modifications are carefully reviewed to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations, and customer 
suitability  . Ne w products are reviewed by the risk 
management committees, including the Risk and 
Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors  . 
Additionally, we want to ensure that existing products continue to be delivered to customers as intended, designed, in accordance with contractual terms and in compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations  . To a ccomplish that, we have 
enhanced our product risk management practices by implementing a product delivery risk assessment framework to oversee the 
delivery of existing products to customers  .  
COMPLIANCE
The Compliance department plays a key role in responsible products, sales and marketing at 
Fifth Third  . Compliance officers are involved 
in the development of products, the approval of marketing materials and campaigns, and oversight of marketing processes and procedures. Compliance officers ensure that information within advertising is prominent, easy to understand, placed where the customer would 
expect to find it, and true  .
Fifth Third has implemented a Consumer and Business Practices Compliance Policy, which requires compliance with various laws, regulations and regulatory guidance that seek to ensure fair, transparent, and equitable treatment of all Fifth Third customers, including prospective 
customers  . In r esponse to the CBPC Policy, an 
enterprise-wide Consumer and Business Practices 
Compliance Program has been implemented  . 
As governed by the Compliance Risk Management framework, the program outlines Fifth Third’s commitment to meeting both the letter and spirit of laws that encourage ethical, fair, and consistent conduct, including prohibitions against discrimination, predatory lending, or engagement in any acts or practices that would be deemed 
unfair, deceptive, or abusive  . 
This program applies to all Fifth Third lines of business and functional areas that engage in consumer and business banking products and services. Moreover, this program applies to all phases of the customer relationship from product design, pricing and compensation, and marketing and advertising to account origination, fulfillment, servicing and account 
closure or disposition  . Fi fth Third has established 
appropriate policies, procedures, and processes 
in response to this program  .SALES AND SERVICE
Our approach to sales and service is to take the time to understand what matters for each customer and to build a product or service 
solution that helps them meet their goals  . Th is is 
the essence of what keeping the “customer at the 
center” means  . A consultative approach ensures 
we are meeting customers’ needs as they evolve and change. 
Employees in every sales role participate in 
consultative-focused training, providing guidance on how to have robust customer conversations 
and how to offer needs-based solutions  . On ce 
completed, additional learning is specialized based 
on line of business and role  . Pe riodic performance 
reviews and check-ins with managers enable 
feedback and professional development  . 
Our approach to sales and service is to take the time 
to understand what matters for each customer and to build a solution that helps them meet their goals.
23  |  FIFTH THIRD BANCORP 2020 ESG REPORT CONTENTS INTRODUCTION ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT INDEXECONOMIC
COMPENSATION
To support our consultative sales and service 
approach, our compensation system focuses on 
customer experience and revenue metrics  .  
We do not impose sales quotas or product-specific sales targets, nor do we require customers to open a certain number of accounts.  Approximately 90% of a retail 
employee’s compensation is salary  . Of t he 
remaining amount, only a small percentage is based on sales performance related to 
customer experience and revenue targets  . In 
2019, we eliminated account openings entirely 
as a factor considered in compensation  . Mo st 
important, sales performance metrics prioritize 
quality over quantity  . 
CUSTOMER INSIGHTS
Understanding our customers is important to us. We use multiple data sources to understand our customers and their experiences, including voice of customer data. Voice of customer data, including complaints, is received through a wide array of verbal and written intake channels, including call center, social media, retail banking centers, 
collections, mortgage origination and others  . 
Customer care teams, including the Office of the President, keep our customers at the center by treating them with kindness, being consistent and 
providing timely resolution  . Value of a Robust Complaint Management Program

review meetings  . Ad ditionally, lines of business 
attend monthly meetings designed to discuss improvement opportunities and progress toward 
previously identified improvement opportunities  . 
FAIR MARKETING

fully activating the Bank’s brand  . Ma rketing 
professionals are motivated by doing what’s right for customers and keeping them at the center 
of all decisions  . Marketing works with our One 
Bank model, meaning that team members across the organization work together to serve the needs of customers and communities seamlessly and holistically.  One Bank works

relationships  . Th is approach is also employed as 
we consider sponsorships and advertising  .

Empowering 
Customers
The enduring truth about 
Fifth Third Bank is that 
our success is a product 
of our customers’ success.  
G . C arlton Hill, who was 
president of the Fifth Third 
Union Trust Company from 
1955 to 1963, often said, 
“We never allow ourselves 
to forget that it is ‘other 
people’s money,’ which is 
entrusted to us  . N or have 
we lost sight of the fact that 
the people whom we serve—their problems, their needs, their well-being—are our 
paramount concern  .”  It’s from this legacy that we at Fifth Third 
strive to be the best relationship bank — 
the One Bank people most value and trust—because from relationships come growth 
and the achievement of shared goals  . W e 
want to provide the products, services and experiences that enable our customers to live 
their best lives  .
Today, consumers have many options 
for establishing their financial accounts  . 
This includes neobanks—those financial technology, or fintech, firms that offer internet-only financial services without physical branches—as well as the large trillionaire banks, where individual consumers 
can often get lost in the shuffle  .
As a traditional bank, we keep our customers 
at the center of everything we do  . W e know 
our customers and build strong relationships with them, which provides us with in-
depth insight into their needs  . Our digital 
transformation focuses on fulfilling those needs and enables us to offer a unique combination of products and solutions , 
which are tailored to meet different consumer segments, alongside our local presence and 
the relationship benefits of a community bank  .
We offer three primary banking programs  for consumers: 
• Fifth Third Express Banking® (see p  . 99)
• Fifth Third Momentum® Banking
• Fifth Third Preferred BankingThese programs are much more than just a checking account; each enables our customers to actively manage and meet the needs of their financial lives, in whatever way 
they wish to do so  . 
Fifth Third Momentum® Banking perfectly 
illustrates our digital transformation  . I t’s a 
fundamentally new approach to personal banking , launched in 2021, made to help 
customers manage money with confidence, protect their identity and finances, earn great 
rewards, and grow their savings  . The first of 
its kind, Fifth Third Momentum® Banking brings the best of fintech innovation together with traditional banking security, reliability and personal touch  to equip 
customers to make smart financial decisions 
both big and small  .

this project and we made every effort to use 
products that save energy and natural resources  .
The atrium physically connects the Fifth

Building to create a cohesive campus 
experience  . As p eople enter, a spacious, open 
public area with gathering places welcomes 
them  . A modern banking center—our 
NextGen branch—showcases our latest 
technology, products and services and 
provides a space for customers to seek 
advice, guidance and partnership.  The Fifth 
Third Bank Museum, which archives more 
than 160 years of helping people achieve their 
dreams, also is accessible  . Beyond a beautiful architectural renovation, 
the project reflects the Bank’s transformation  . 
We’ve transformed digitally by enabling 
our customers and clients to bank where 
they want, when they want and how they 
want  . We’ve transformed the way we serve 
communities and approach environmental 
sustainability  . We ’re transforming our 
inclusion and diversity efforts throughout 
our workforce and among our suppliers by 
setting six bold goals  . W e’re also transforming 
the way we serve our employees by raising the minimum wage 50% in two years and 
providing innovative wellness, financial and

great modern and forward-looking bank,” 
our CEO said  . “W e are honored to present the

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Our Board of Directors provides oversight of, and guidance to, our executive management team in the development of corporate strategy, risk management, corporate culture and other important aspects of our business, including ESG topics.

Our Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics forms 
the foundation of our Ethics 
Program and helped Fifth 
Third to be recognized as 
one of 2021’s World’s Most 
Ethical Companies®.
The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
is an important, Board-approved document that serves as a guide to help employees understand how to apply our Core Values to the 
decisions required of them  . Every employee 
and contractor is required to review the Code, comply with it and refer to it regularly—and to sign an annual acknowledgment.  In 2020, over 
99% of employees and contractors made this acknowledgment, a requirement that is regularly 
tested and verified  . 
Additionally, all employees and contractors are required to complete ethics training on an annual basis.
 In 2020, 99  .7% of a ll required compliance 
training modules were completed by employees, including ethics training  . Fu rther, ethics training 
is incorporated into other employee training modules required of employees and contractors depending on specific roles and positions within 
the Bank  . It i s important to note that the Board of 
Directors also undergoes ethics training  .  
The Code is the foundation of our ethics program 
at Fifth Third  . Th e foundation helped Fifth Third 
to be recognized again as one of the 2021 World’s 
Most Ethical Companies®  . Th is honor came from 
the highly respected Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards 
of ethical business practices  . It p uts us in elite 
company, as only 135 organizations from around the globe—including only five banks—made the grade. Ethisphere scores companies in five categories: ethics and compliance, culture of ethics, corporate citizenship and responsibility, 
governance, and leadership and reputation  . 
Ethisphere also recognized the Bank as one of the 
World’s Most Ethical Companies® in 2019  . 
ANTI-COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES
The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  
outlines Fifth Third’s position on anti-competitive 
activities  . Ant i-trust laws, also referred to as 
“competition laws,” are rules developed by  
the U  .S . government to protect consumers  
from predatory business practices  . Th eir goal  
is to ensure that fair competition exists in  
the marketplace  . 
We ensure that business activities that involved any of our competitors are conducted with great care 
to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations  .Prohibited activities include:
• Any agreements between competitors relating to prices, allocations of territories 
or customers or limitations of products  .
• Use of competitors’ confidential or proprietary information.
• Engaging in any other anti-competitive behavior , including disparaging or 
making false statements in relation to competitors, misappropriating competitors’ trade secrets, or encouraging competitors’ customers to 
break contracts  .
We are responsible for adherence to the anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations of the 
countries in which we operate  . Th is includes 
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and 
the U  .K . Bribery Act, as well as other applicable 
laws and regulations  . Th e regulations prohibit 
bribery of a foreign or domestic government 
official for the purpose of influencing that official  . 
These regulations apply to conduct both inside 
and outside of U  .S . te rritory  . Th ese regulations 
also apply to third parties conducting business 
with Fifth Third such as suppliers and consultants  . 
While Fifth Third has a low risk of anti-bribery and anti-corruption violations, Fifth Third has practices in place for activities that pose a higher risk of violations, such as payments to vendors outside of 
the United States as well as foreign travel  .

Fifth Third’s Risk Management Framework 
outlines our approach to managing risk in support of our Vision. Key elements of the 
Framework are described in detail below  .
RISK APPETITE 
Fifth Third’s risk appetite is established in alignment with our strategic, financial and capital 
plans  . The Board and executive management 
approve the risk appetite, which is considered in the development of business strategies and forms 
the basis for enterprise risk management  . The r isk 
appetite is defined using quantitative metrics and qualitative measures to ensure prudent risk taking 
and drive balanced decision making  . Our goal is 
to ensure that aggregate risks do not exceed Fifth Third’s risk appetite , and that risks taken 
are supportive of our portfolio diversification and 
profitability objectives  .

RISKTHREE LINES OF DEFENSE
Accountability for managing risk is driven through a Three Lines of Defense structure:
FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE THIRD LINE OF DEFENSE
The first line of defense 
is comprised of front line units that create risk or are accountable for risk. These groups are the Bank’s primary risk-takers and are responsible for implementing effective internal controls and maintaining processes for identifying, assessing, controlling, and mitigating the risks associated with their activities, consistent with established risk appetite and 
limits  . The first line of defense 
also includes business units that provide information technology, operations, servicing, processing, or  
other support  .The second line of defense, or independent risk management, consists of risk management, compliance, and credit review. The second line is responsible for developing frameworks and policies to govern risk-taking activities, overseeing risk-taking of the organization, assessing risks and issues independent of front line units, advising on controlling risks, and providing 
input on key risk decisions  . Ri sk 
management complements the first line’s management of risk-taking activities through its monitoring and reporting responsibilities, including 
adherence to the risk appetite  . 
Additionally, the second line is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling aggregate and 
emerging risks enterprise-wide  .The third line of defense is internal audit , which provides 
oversight of the first and second lines of defense, and independent assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of governance, risk management, 
and internal controls  .

Keeping the customer at the center of 
everything we do and delivering a world-class 
customer experience every time is a top priority 
and way of life at Fifth Third. When it comes to 
security and privacy, our customers expect us to

procedures, tools and technologies needed to 
mitigate the risks associated with these threats  .
Our Information Security team’s mission is to

our brand and to raise the level of trust and Strategic Focus Areas
In January of 2020, we completed our Agile transformation by aligning the 
entire organization to our Agile design  . This es tablished the organizational 
structure for our focus areas  .
IDENTITY FOUNDATIONS
Develop and drive a unified strategy and technology stack that enables future identity verification and access control across internal and customer-
facing applications and IT services  .NEXT GENERATION DETECTION  
AND RESPONSE
Use best-in-class third-party products to “knock down the noise” and focus on the most sophisticated attacks, leveraging a threat intelligence-based approach paired with dynamic and custom detection 
and response capabilities  .
ZERO-TRUST/CLOUD
Build out automated controls for cloud consumption and redesign how employees access the internet and our network utilizing zero-trust principles, meaning organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and must verify anything and everything trying to connect to 
its systems before allowing access  .PROGRAM FOUNDATION
Drive continuous improvement in foundational elements of the Information Security Program, such as Business Continuity, Vulnerability Management, Security for Affiliates, Divisions and Subsidiaries, Metric Generation, Controls Framework 
and more  .

TRANSFORMATION PATH TO  
STRATEGIC FOCUS
In January of 2020, we completed our Agile 
transformation by aligning the entire organization 
to our Agile design  . Th is established the 
organizational structure upon which we focused 
on Program Foundations, Identity Foundations, 
Next Generation Detection and Response, and 
Zero-Trust/Cloud  .
Despite the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the team was still able to move forward on these areas of strategic focus by:
• Revamping the vulnerability management reporting capabilities and process to ensure teams were provided appropriate information to prioritize risk
• Managing the technology lifecycle of identity related products  to better align 
with our strategic direction
• Moving to a threat intelligence-driven process  that allows our detection and 
response teams to focus on the most advanced attackers
• Continuing to mature our security in cloud and zero-trust network access solutionsThe hard work and continuous planning and 
preparation of the Business Continuity Team was 
highlighted in 2020, as they guided us through 
not only the pandemic and all its implications, 
but also a record hurricane season and civil 
unrest  . The Bank also has a cybersecurity incident 
response plan that addresses cybersecurity 
events that impact data or operations of the Bank  . 
The plan is aligned with our business continuity 
crisis management plan as well as our escalation 
procedures for sensitive information, which is 
overseen by the Bank’s Privacy Office  .
PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY
The Bank has established a strong foundation 
of governance, policies and procedures 
based on a tight alignment with regulatory 
requirements and standard frameworks such as 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
and Control Objectives for Information 
Technologies. This foundation, combined 
with regular program assessments by outside 
organizations, keeps the Information Security 
team more alert to cyber risk, more deliberate 
in building dynamic defenses to protect our 
customers and the Bank, and more collaborative 
in exploring effective solutions with both internal 
and external partners  . Fifth Third also is committed to protecting our 
customers through our privacy policies  . Th ese 
policies describe the information we collect, 
the information customers provide when using 
our products and services, and information 
about when customers can choose to limit data 
sharing  based on state, federal and international 
regulations  . De tails of our commitment to privacy

We have implemented measures designed 
to secure customer information from loss or 
unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure  . 
Information is stored on secured servers behind 
firewalls, and all data transported on our website 
and mobile applications is encrypted  . To f urther 
help protect information, the Bank requires 
employees to review and know information 
security and privacy policies  . All employees 
and contractors are required to complete 
privacy and information security training on 
an annual basis, including: privacy compliance, 
information lifecycle governance, managing 
information and data, creating a safe cyber 
environment and business continuity.  In 2020, 
99 .7% of all required compliance training modules 
were completed by employees, including privacy 
and information security training modules  . 
Internal and external assessments are conducted 
regularly to ensure our defenses are solid, that 
we are meeting regulatory requirements and 
that we are continually maturing the Information 
Security program  . To ensure the Bank’s third-party suppliers take 
information security and privacy as seriously 
as Fifth Third does, our Master Services 
Agreements include extensive articles on 
information technology security requirements 
and breach procedures  as well as confidentiality 
and protection of nonpublic personal information  . 
Our Master Services Agreement articles 
identify expectations , including, but not 
limited to:
• What the supplier’s information security program should include
• Who needs to review and approve their information security program
• What safeguards need to be in place
• How the Bank should be notified of  a breach 
• How proprietary information should  be handledEnsuring our third-party suppliers are doing all 
they can to protect the Bank and our customers

THE VALUE OF STRONG LEADERSHIP 
AND GOVERNANCE
Information security and privacy teams regularly 
report to executive leadership and the Board to 
ensure everyone is aligned to the Bank’s priorities 
and focus  . 
• The chief information security officer and Privacy Office report regularly to the Board or Board committees to keep abreast of all efforts 
to prevent, detect and respond to risks  .
Internal and external assessments are conducted 
regularly to ensure our defenses are solid and that we are meeting or exceeding all regulatory security requirements.

CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT
Business Continuity Management (BCM) provides 
a framework and holistic process for building organizational resilience with the capability of an effective response that safeguards the interests of its customers, employees, reputation, brand and value-creating activities. We do this by identifying 
core services and the processes and technologies that underpin them and then, once that ‘analysis’ is complete, developing plans and strategies that will enable the business to continue operations and effectively recover from any type of event, regardless 
of cause or impact  .
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:
• Integrate BCM, Disaster Recovery and Event Management responsibilities and activities into a BCM Program that fully adheres with regulatory requirements and aligns with meeting needs of  the business
• Plan for, mitigate and manage threats and risks BEFORE they impact Fifth Third, including conducting cyber war games and disaster recovery exercises
• Enable the Company to continue to operate when faced with adverse conditions
—Not just Information Technology, but all core 
business processes

activities begins with the Third Party Management Council, which assesses the portfolio of third-party service providers  
as well as the management of risks, issues and performance on the third-party population and oversees adherence to the Third Party Risk Management Policy and Program. 
• The Third Party Management Council reports to the Operational Risk Committee , 
which in turn is accountable to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and the Risk and Compliance Committee.

INITIATION & SELECTION 
Fifth Third seeks to strategically partner with 
highly qualified third parties that provide solutions that improve our processes and service levels, increase the quality of our products and services and reduce our total costs while meeting Fifth Third Bank’s risk management and 
compliance expectations  . We also bel ieve that 
promoting supplier diversity is an integral part of our success and we are proud of the many alliances and partnerships we have with diverse 
companies throughout our footprint  .DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW
After initiation and selection is complete but prior to the execution of a contract, we conduct due diligence to evaluate: the risk a third party product/service may present to the Bank; the third party’s ability to manage all risk matters related to the individual product(s) purchased or service(s) being performed; the strength of the third party control environment; and the third 
party’s ability to effectively mitigate risk  .
CONTRACT 
This phase produces and secures a contract that details the obligation of the third party, inclusive of standard contract language and other legal requirements (terms and provisions), Service 
Level Agreements, and appropriate signoffs  . SLAs 
include remedies for non-performance, and are designed to recognize and address issues in a 
timely manner  .ONBOARDING 
Fifth Third sets up payment and executes on the required oversight and monitoring that occurs while 
developing a formal monitoring and testing plan  . 
ONGOING MONITORING 
The level of ongoing monitoring required for each third party is determined by the level of risk 
the third party poses to the Bank  . Formali zing 
ongoing monitoring allows the Bank to properly monitor third party performance and remediate 
any issues that arise during the relationship  .
TERMINATION 
Unfortunately, there are events that at times may cause one or both parties to terminate the 
relationship  . If this is re quired, the Bank proceeds 
in a professional manner, in accordance with the 
terms of the contract with the third party  . Promoting supplier 
diversity  is an integral part 
of our success.

COVID-19 Pandemic Actions
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the word ‘essential’ was often 
used by government officials, media and families, especially as 
it related to work and workers  . Our approach at Fifth Third 
was to view everyone as essential—our employees, customers, 
business clients, shareholders, and communities—and to serve 
them the best way we knew how. 
We were a leader among our peers in offering 
hardship relief programs, even before the 
federal government implemented the CARES 
Act, and we played an essential role for our 
small and mid-sized business customers by 
our lending through the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP). To help our communities through 
their struggle, our efforts included donating 
nearly $9 million for COVID-19 relief, exceeding 
our five-year, $32 billion Community Commitment, 
and announcing a $2  .8 bil lion investment to 
accelerate racial equality, equity and inclusion  . 
We are proud of the Fifth Third better® impact 
we’ve had, and are committed to doing more 
in the future to ensure that the effects of the 
pandemic are properly and swiftly addressed  . CUSTOMERS 
We took quick and decisive steps to help 
protect our customers’ physical and financial 
health  . We kept over 99% of our banking 
centers open and maintained access to 52,000 
fee-free ATMs to serve customers during the 
pandemic to complement our digital and mobile 
banking options  . We q uickly implemented social 
distancing and protective measures as outlined by 
U .S . CDC officials  . We a lso improved our cleaning 
measures to safeguard employees and customers 
to the best of our ability  . 
Through 2020, we interacted with over three million 
customers and executed over 150,000 hardship 
requests, representing approximately $3 billion 
in balances  and an additional approximately $6 
billion in our mortgage servicing portfolio  . “When you see someone 
who’s hard-working hit a 
rough patch, there’s nothing 
better than being able to help keep them going.”

A collaboration with Steady and its innovative app 
helped our customers find work and maximize 
their earning capabilities  . Add itionally, our Job 
Seeker’s Toolkit, provided by NextJob, and 
Operation HOPE’s financial coaching services were 
made available to the public through the year  . 
In 2020, our bankers and relationship managers 
worked diligently to help their business clients  . 
Over 40,000 PPP applications were processed 
with the U  .S . S mall Business Administration, 
representing $5  .4 bi llion in forgivable loans and 
supporting 605,000 jobs  . M ore than 85% of the 
loans approved were for less than $150,000 and 
95% of loans were to businesses with fewer than 
50 employees  . In rounds 1 and 2 of the Paycheck 
Protection Program, Fifth Third ranked in the 
top 15 lenders.  
In 2021, our bankers continued to serve clients 
through the Paycheck Protection Program  . 
Through June 3, 2021, we processed $1  .9 bi llion 
in loans and supported 230,000 jobs  . 9 7% of the

EMPLOYEES 
Fifth Third took significant measures to provide 
our employees with a sense of safety, security 
and certainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We continued to employ approximately 20,000 
people across our footprint and hired 1,000 more 
people in retail banking, mortgage support and 
operations to help meet increased demand for 
services  .
Our employees showed tremendous agility and 
customer focus through 2020  . Because banks 
were categorized as an essential service 
provider, we remained open for business and 
approximately 10,000 retail and operations 
employees continued to serve our customers 
while working on-site.  The Bank rewarded 
employees who provided frontline, essential 
banking services during the pandemic with a 
special payment of up to $1,000  . 
At the same time, the Company successfully 
transitioned approximately 50% of employees to remote work. We successfully and quickly 
resolved several challenges this created, including 
ensuring physical safety and wellness and 
maintaining productivity through advanced 
technology  . In a ddition, thousands of employees 
had their work duties reassigned temporarily 
(some for several months) in order to help support 
our operations as well as the Paycheck Protection 
Program  . As a r esult, some employees received 
special bonuses to recognize their extraordinary 
efforts  . Hiring and onboarding programs were 
also adjusted and deployed virtually  . To protect the health and safety of employees and customers, and consistent 
with CDC, state and local guidance, Fifth Third established social distancing, 
hygiene and environmental safety protocols for on-site workers at our 
banking centers and offices. We also: 
• Offered free COVID-19 testing for employees  enrolled in Fifth Third’s medical coverage  .
• Increased paid time away and allocated additional sick days.
• Reimbursed employees at the end of 2020 for unused purchased vacation days and awarded 
five special vacation days to eligible employees for 2021. 
• Doubled the number of days in our Back-up Care program from 15 days to 30 days and 
waived the copay in March and April to address immediate and unplanned needs  .
• Tracked and reported on employee circumstances related to COVID-19 to develop data-
driven responses and solutions as the situation evolved  .
• Conducted pulse surveys with employees to collect regular feedback on our COVID-19 response and their well-being.  (See the Employee Engagement  section of this report for 
additional details  .)
“Working in retail during the pandemic 
has been pretty stressful as it is. It’s 
been a huge weight off my shoulders knowing that if my daughter can’t 
go to her normal day care, we have 
another option besides trying to find a 
family member who can take her.”

Feeding the Hungry
With the pandemic making the holidays 
tougher for many families, Fifth Third’s 
Young Professionals Business Resource 
Group organized a food box donation 
effort to benefit the Community Shelter 
Board. This organization provided a list of 
items needed to help feed families over the 
holidays  . Th e YP BRG then advocated for 
the effort and collected boxes of food  . 
Every department of the Bank 
participated, including Retail, Commercial 
and Business Banking, Wealth & Asset 
Management, Office of the President,  
and Marketing  .

In Louisville, Kentucky, our support of Dare 
to Care enabled the food bank to deliver over 
51,000 meals to kids at different sites , provide 
over 40,000 food boxes and deliver over 1 million 
pounds of food through mobile pantry and  
Get Fresh stops  . 
Emily Carter Essex, director of business 
partnerships at Dare to Care said, “To our Fifth 
Third Bank partners, on behalf of our board, 
our team and the many neighbors and friends 
you empower us to serve, thank you for your 
incredible support  . Now, more than ever, we 
are grateful for the way you have allowed us to 
care for our neighbors. Our community faces 
considerable challenges, food insecurity among 
them  . While C OVID -19 challenged us in ways 
we never imagined, our team was steadfast in 
our commitment to nourishing our neighbors  . 
We swiftly adjusted programs and operations 
to safely deliver the same quality food that this 
community has come to expect from Dare to 
Care  . In our recently completed fiscal year 2020, 
we distributed healthier food than ever in our 50 
year history—27 million pounds  . That ’s enough to 
prepare 23 million meals! Thank you  . We cou ldn’t 
do it without you  .”  
In addition to philanthropic donations, we 
implemented a new virtual volunteerism 
initiative in response to the pandemic, which 
enabled our employees whose devotion to 
serving communities increased with so many in 
need  . The platform enabled employees to seek 
and find opportunities to volunteer their time 
and talent virtually  . Fur ther, we ensured that our 
financial education platforms for both adults and 
young people were made available to a wider 
audience online so we could help community 
members regain financial stability  . 
Our COVID-19 response efforts were 
acknowledged externally  . In July 2020, we were 
recognized by an independent third party as the 
top-performing bank among the 12 largest U.S. 
retail banks  based on our pandemic response for 
our customers, communities, and employees  .

Accelerating Racial Equality, 
Equity and Inclusion 
In the wake of widespread civil protests, Chairman & CEO 
Greg Carmichael made a prompt and public statement against 
racism, and the Bank committed itself to being part of the 
solution  . Our commitment was more than words; it resulted in 
concrete, ongoing actions. 
It was necessary that we acknowledge that we 
hadn’t previously done enough and recognize 
that our work to address shortcomings was far 
from over  . As t he nation reached a tipping point 
in a long history of racial injustice impacting Black 
Americans, we, too, were galvanized to redouble 
our efforts  . 
An enterprise-wide strategic initiative, led by 
the Inclusion and Diversity team and supported 
by the EDLC and the Enterprise Program 
Management Office, was launched to ensure 
accountability and to achieve measurable and 
sustainable progress  . This initiative is called 
“Accelerating Racial Equality, Equity and Inclusion” 
or AREEI, and is composed of three workstreams: 
customers, communities and employees  . 
Each workstream has a specific emphasis on 
accelerating the Bank’s progress toward an 
equitable environment for Black Americans  .AREEI FOR CUSTOMERS AND 
COMMUNITIES 
We are currently refining our lens on Black 
customers in four areas:
• Mortgage
• Small business banking/business banking
• Commercial and treasury management
• Wealth and asset management 
For home mortgages, we are engaging with real 
estate agents and through dedicated marketing 
in Chicago, Charlotte, North Carolina, Cincinnati, 
Columbus, Ohio, Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis, 
and Tampa, Florida, to educate and raise 
awareness among new homebuyers  . SPOTLIGHT 
Fifth Third Observes 
Juneteenth
As The American Banker noted in a 
June 16, 2020 article, Fifth Third was the 
first financial institution to announce 
plans to observe Juneteenth, which 
commemorates the emancipation 
of slaves being set free  . Offices and 
banking centers were closed at 2 p.m. 
June 19, 2020 and employees were paid 
for a full day’s work.
“We cannot fix 400 years of injustice with 
one day,” said Stephanie Smith, senior 
vice president and chief inclusion and 
diversity officer, in the story  . “B ut we 
can start taking steps to acknowledge 
the fact that there is racial inequity 
in organizations, corporations and 
communities and we want to play 
our part  in saying that we’re willing to 
recognize difficult moments  .”
Fifth Third’s Chairman and CEO Greg 
Carmichael said, “As we observe 
Juneteenth, each of us should pause, 
reflect, and contemplate its significance  . 
While observing Juneteenth is only one 
small step toward a more racially just and 
equitable organization and community, we 
believe it is a step in the right direction  .”
“Looking forward, Fifth Third will continue 
to encourage employees to celebrate 
and commemorate Juneteenth  . We a lso 
will continue to provide resources and support to foster conversations about 
inclusion and diversity  .” 
57  |  FIFTH THIRD BANCORP 2020 ESG REPORT CONTENTS INTRODUCTION ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT INDEXSOCIAL
The Bank also took intentional steps to help 
close the racial wealth gap for Black Americans 
and to eliminate the social and economic barriers 
that negatively impact Black Americans, including 
job creation and job preparation  . In D ecember 
2020, we announced a three-year $2  .8 bil lion 
commitment that included $2  .2 bil lion in loan 
capital, $500 million for investments in Fifth Third 
communities, $60 million in financial accessibility 
efforts, and $40 million in philanthropic investment  . In addition to the community financial 
investments for Fifth Third’s customers and 
communities, the efforts of the Inclusion and 
Diversity team and the Executive Diversity Leadership Council include an employee-focused 
workstream to ensure the Bank maintains and 
grows its culture of equality, equity and inclusion 
among its workforce  .
AREEI FOR EMPLOYEES
In 2020, our efforts primarily focused on 
enhancing the employee experience of our 
Black employees while remaining mindful and 
inclusive of all minorities and diverse employees  . 
The strategic approach includes a mixture of 
continuous listening and learning, providing 
tools and resources, enhancing all employees’ 
awareness of racism and inequality, and analyzing all employee-related policies and procedures to 
mitigate bias  . To create awareness around challenges faced 
by Black Americans, our Inclusion and Diversity 
team created the Fifth Third Inclusion Toolkit: 
From Awareness to Advocacy. The toolkit has 
useful terms, actions community members can 
take, movies that can be watched, recommended 
books and articles, and other ally and anti-racism 
resources  . We p rovided this helpful resource to our 
employees and also made it available to customers 
and communities on 53.com/racialequity  .

$2.8B AREEI Strategic Pillars
The $2  .8 bil lion commitment is focused on four strategic pillars that directly impact customers and communities 
with targeted outcomes  . We w ill track progress and measure success in the following areas:
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS
Fifth Third will engage in 
comprehensive neighborhood 
revitalization to help improve 
outcomes and quality of life 
indicators for communities of 
color that have experienced 
decades of disinvestment  . 
Through the introduction of 
an innovative $100 million 
Neighborhood Fund, the Bank will 
focus on improving the social and 
environmental determinants in a 
community by bringing together 
resources and expertise from 
across the Bank  . Th e Fund will 
conduct a competitive application 
process across the Bank’s 11-state 
footprint and award at least five 
communities with long-term 
investments to accelerate impact 
and outcomes  .ACCESS TO CAPITAL
Fifth Third will continue 
expanding access to home loans 
and business capital.  The Bank 
aims to increase its mortgage 
lending to Black customers by 
31%, with a focus on achieving 
parity in its top eight markets 
where Black Americans reside  .
Owning a small business can help 
build wealth and create a legacy 
for business owners to transfer 
to their families  . Bl ack business 
owners can face challenges finding 
the capital to start and maintain 
their businesses  . Fi fth Third 
helps to create opportunities for business owners to tap into the 
financial support they need  . Sm all 
business lending by Fifth Third 
is targeted to increase by 25% in 
majority minority communities  . 
The Bank will continue to invest 
and expand partnerships with 
community development financial 
institutions to increase the 
sources for capital  .FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND 
EDUCATION
The Bank will focus on achieving 
parity in its top eight markets 
where Black Americans reside  . 
Through these efforts Fifth Third 
will provide wider access to 
business and consumer loans, 
to expand availability to tools 
for financial education and 
develop innovative banking 
solutions for the unbanked and 
underbanked.  Additionally, the 
Bank will continue to work with 
and invest in historically Black 
colleges and universities to 
support scholarships and career 
readiness through internships 
and early career development 
opportunities  .SOCIAL JUSTICE AND 
ADVOCACY
The Bank is investing and 
partnering with organizations 
that actively engage and 
support laws and policies that 
address systemic racism, create 
improvements in worker re-entry 
and improve economic mobility 
and skill-based training , which will 
provide for greater access to jobs 
and skills for low-wage workers 
through workforce development 
programs  . The  Bank already 
has committed $1 million to the 
National Urban League for a 
workforce development program 
that focuses on building individual 
skills and developing the tools that 
are needed for business success  . 
59  |  FIFTH THIRD BANCORP 2020 ESG REPORT CONTENTS INTRODUCTION ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT INDEXSOCIAL
In June and July 2020, the Inclusion and 
Diversity team and the Bank’s African American 
Business Resource groups facilitated 31 “Let’s 
Talk” listening sessions. The first sessions were for 
Black employees  . In A ugust, all employees were 
invited to share their experiences and thoughts 
in a safe space  . Mo re than 550 employees 
participated in the sessions offered  . Th ese sessions 
were instrumental in forging a strategic plan that will ensure Black employees understand that racial 
discrimination is not tolerated at Fifth Third Bank, 
that their contributions are valued and that they are vital to this journey  . To co ntinue providing a 
safe forum for employees to express themselves, 
the Bank has partnered with an experienced 
diverse supplier to hold additional listening 
sessions in 2021  . 
All employees also had access to resources to help 
guide empathetic, supportive conversations about 
racial equality, equity and inclusion  . Re sources 
were added to LifeWorks, our Employee 
Assistance Program, to help address feelings of 
anxiety, sadness and worry among employees  .Unconscious bias training launched to all 
employees in July 2020; 100% of employees 
and contractors completed this by the end of 
the year. Going forward, all new Bank employees 
are required to undergo this training within their

Mentors Matter 
In her 22-year career at Fifth Third, 
Stephanie Smith has witnessed the 
company’s evolution and growth in 
numerous ways—from product and 
service innovations to changes in 
leadership—yet she believes its Core Values 
and commitment to inclusion and diversity 
have always been at the foundation of 
the Bank’s strategy and decisions  . 
“One of the things that makes me proud to 
say I’m a Fifth Third employee is not only our 
long-standing commitment to inclusion and 
diversity, but also that we always look for ways 
to improve  in that regard for our customers, 
communities and employees,” said Smith  . “The Bank has made tremendous inroads in 
the past two decades and I’m honored to 
help lead us and move us forward  .”
One of the ways Smith wants to help Fifth 
Third move forward is by enhancing career 
development opportunities for Black women 
and other minorities  . 
“When I started here, the world of banking was 
predominantly male, especially in leadership 
roles,” said Smith  . “ Fifth Third was making 
progress, and the commitment to be more 
inclusive and diverse and to help women and 
other minorities with career development 
was sincere  . I found mentors that helped me 
navigate toward new opportunities and now 
I’m giving the same mentorship and support 
to others.  Without these rich gems in my 
life, I would have been working a job versus 
what I do today, which is to share my passion, 
commitment and experience in a joint effort 
to improve the lives of Fifth Third’s employees, 
communities and customers  .”
Her journey with Fifth Third began in 1994 as 
a mortgage loan underwriter and co-creator 
of the Bank’s Good Neighbor Loan Program 
for first-time homebuyers  . S he credits her 
experience with Cincinnati’s Department of 
Housing and the nonprofit Neighborhood 
Housing Services of Cincinnati for introducing 
her to the Bank  . S he moved into roles of 
increasing responsibility in the Bank’s retail 
division, the Fifth Third Foundation Office, 
commercial banking, business banking and 
community and economic development  . In 2015, Smith served as director of supplier 
diversity  . Under her leadership, the Bank’s 
supplier diversity spend increased 900% 
and the Bank’s program in 2018 was named 
one of the best of the decade by Minority 
Business News  . T he Bank also established 
relationships with the National Minority 
Supplier Development Council, the U  .S . S mall 
Business Administration, the U  .S . D epartment 
of Veterans Affairs and the Women’s Business 
Enterprise National Council  .
Smith became Fifth Third’s chief inclusion and 
diversity officer in 2019  . S he is responsible for 
developing and executing an ecosystem of 
inclusion that promotes engagement with all 
the Bank’s stakeholders, including employees, 
suppliers and customers  .
“The work of inclusion and diversity is 
ongoing and a part of what we do and 
how we think,”  Smith said  . “ When it comes 
to what we do, I believe we can continue to accelerate racial equality, equity and 
inclusion by looking for opportunities 
to increase our workforce diversity and 
offer development opportunities for our 
employees  . C ontinuously listening to our 
business resource groups for insights helps us keep our fingers on the pulse of the employee 
experience and our culture  . I n the realm of 
how we think, our unconscious bias training has been eye-opening for many and has helped everyone better understand that our 
work is not finished when it comes to making 
Fifth Third the One Bank people—all people—
most value and trust  .”

Black Enterprise: Top 
Bankers Seek to Help Black Firms Manage Twin Pandemics of COVID-19 
and Race
An October 2020 report in the business 
publication Black Enterprise detailed how 
two of our leaders— Kala Gibson and 
Kevin Lavender —are helping to address 
the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and 
racial prejudice  . 
Gibson, executive vice president and head of 
Business Banking and chief enterprise corporate 
responsibility officer, and Lavender, executive vice 
president and head of Commercial Banking, were 
in a unique position to help as the health crisis 
and systemic racism rose to the forefront of the 
consciousness of the nation  .   The article stated, “Throughout the first 
wave of the pandemic, both Gibson and 
Lavender were very much attuned to the 
unique challenges of Black businesses  . 
Large numbers of them tend to be woefully 
undercapitalized and prone to being severely 
weakened during economic crises  . … That’s 
why early on the two lending leaders 
placed a special emphasis on finding ways 
to bolster small Black firms, which Gibson 
estimates represent roughly 7% of his 
Business Banking clientele.  Not only do 
the two want such companies to survive 
COVID-19 but to prove to be innovators that 
will thrive in a post-pandemic world  .”
“There wasn’t anything that could have 
prepared me or my team for this moment  . 
Our main goal was just trying to make sure 
that we as a team stayed focused,” Gibson 
said in the article  . “ The goal was to make 
sure we had a higher purpose and that higher 
purpose was making sure that we were able 
to keep as many small businesses in business 
as possible  . I t was that rallying cry, that 
defining moment for us as bankers to do our 
part and make sure that our customers and 
our country stayed afloat  .”During the pandemic, Lavender worked to 
address the needs and concerns of the Bank’s 
Commercial clients  . A s he did, he had his eye 
on the Bank’s commitment to improve lives in 
the Black community  . “ I think our country, our 
Bank, will look different two years, five years 
from now on this specific point,” Lavender 
said . “At Fifth Third…we made it very clear 
with communication from our CEO and our 
executive diversity leadership council that 
today Black lives do matter. Historically, 
banks like to say, ‘We’re Switzerland  . L et all 
sides do what you need to  . B ut we’re here just 
to lend money  .’”
Lavender continued, “I do think that we 
as the financial services industry have an 
opportunity because we are the lifeblood of communities in terms of spurring 
commerce  . I see it as my obligation, Fifth 
Third’s obligation, to make sure that we 
put the right people in the right place 
to give African American entrepreneurs 
an opportunity  . That means making it a 
priority in the people that I hire, the people I 
promote, and the way that I pay them  . W e as 
an industry and Fifth Third have to get to a 
position of how we incent our bankers to do 
“What makes Fifth Third unique is the fact that it represents 
the only major bank in the nation in which African 
Americans oversee all of its business lending operations.”

the right thing in all communities and, 
especially at this point, in the Black 
community  .”
Gibson agreed  . “T here was inequality 
in our healthcare system and there’s 
inequality in our financial system and 
it’s systemic  . We have to address 
it at its root cause and work with 
our government officials and other 
advocacy groups to reverse that. As 
Kevin mentioned, a lot of it is going 
to start with our hiring practices 
within our own organizations to 
make sure that our staff reflects the 
communities that we serve, that we 
have the right leadership at the top of 
these organizations, and at the board 
level  . But it’s also going to require 
us at the grassroots level, too, just 
to make sure that there’s financing, 
government programs, all the things 
needed to get us to a place where 
there is equality when it comes to 
financial justice as well as health  .”

STRATEGY 
Recruiting and engaging an inclusive and diverse 
workforce is a top priority  . We believe that our 
multicultural recruitment strategy strengthens 
the Bank by developing an employee base that 
reflects the communities we serve while also 
enhancing the lives of tomorrow’s leaders. As 
such, we have deepened our relationships with 
traditional colleges as well as more than 20 
historically Black colleges and universities as a 
way to strengthen the pipeline of diverse talent  . 
Our strategic focus on HBCUs deepens the 
pipeline of the best and brightest diverse talent 
and strengthens tomorrow’s leaders at the 
Bank  . We have invested nearly $300,000 
with HBCUs since 2017  to help prepare high-
achieving students—many of whom are first-
generation college students and come from 
low- and moderate-income families—to excel in 
the workforce  .
Our investment includes over 500 service hours 
providing skills coaching and delivering our 
Fifth Third financial empowerment programs to 
help reduce student debt.
In recent years, students have been recruited 
from nine HBCUs: Central State University, 
Clark Atlanta University, Florida A&M University, 
Johnson C  . Sm ith University, Wilberforce 
University, Tennessee State University, North 
Carolina A&T University, Spelman College and 
Morehouse College  . Th ese schools’ strong 
business and science, engineering, technology and math programs were noted for developing 
talent that would excel at Fifth Third  . Th rough 
the strategy, the Bank has increased its offers to 
multicultural students  .
Twenty-nine students have been hired by Fifth Third from the 20 HBCUs since our program 
began in 2017. Our strategy also emphasizes 
internships and long-term employment through 
leadership programs  . For a dditional information 
about these programs see page 81-83  of this 
report  .“I have really 
enjoyed how 
there is always 
a different 
avenue of 
learning in place for a leadership participant like 
myself. Fifth Third has helped me learn how to adapt in 
different environments and 
still be able to produce  
good work.”

INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES
We are proud of our decades-long leadership 
with Project SEARCH, a school-to-work transition 
program for high school students with disabilities  . 
The goal of Project SEARCH is competitive 
employment at the end of the one-year program  . 
We were one of the founders of the public-
private collaboration, which is operated out of the 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center  .
Project SEARCH has operated at Fifth Third 
campuses for over 15 years in Cincinnati and in 
Grand Rapids, Michigan  . Through the end of 2020, 
we have trained more than 375 individuals; of 
those, 33 are now Bank employees.
While Project SEARCH’s annual golf outing did 
not occur in 2020 due to the pandemic, Fifth 
Third donated $25,000 to the program  . To d ate, 
this event has contributed over $1  .6 mil lion to 
help support the program  .
Based on needs identified by our Individuals 
with Disabilities Business Resource Group, Fifth 
Third also collaborated with Ayco, a company 
that provides a financial wellness program 
for our employees, to offer a special financial 
education course for teammates who live with 
or have family members with a disability  . The 
session in 2020 focused on helping these families 
manage everyday expenses, leverage Fifth Third 
benefits, make the most of government resources 
and establish a plan for long-term needs  .SPOTLIGHT 
Project SEARCH Forges Ahead 
Despite the unusual circumstance we found 
ourselves in due to the pandemic, Fifth Third 
Project SEARCH students forged ahead  . Fi fth 
Third adapted for the 2020-21 school year 
to continue to offer rotational experiences to build competitive and marketable skills in 
Cincinnati and Grand Rapids  . 
The Class of 2020 had eight students in 
Grand Rapids and 12 at our Madisonville 
campus in Cincinnati  . Adapting the program 
around pandemic protocols required 
creative thinking, including designing a 
schedule for safe, socially-distant on-site 
rotations, conducting virtual meetings with 
staff, families and community partners, 
and daily health monitoring of interns and 
staff  along with enhanced cleaning of Project 
SEARCH workspaces  .“Our students need to gain relevant and 
meaningful experience, especially during 
these times when so much is uncertain,” said 
Harry Snyder, president and CEO of Great 
Oaks Career Campuses  . “Our partnership 
with Fifth Third provides them with real-world experience in a way that supports 
them and prepares them for whatever the 
future holds.”
Parents of Project SEARCH interns agree that 
the program holds tremendous value  . Sa id

Fifth Third was the first bank to design a 
checking account for the Achieving a Better Life 
Experience program, known as ABLE. The special 
checking account is an outcome of our work with 
the National ABLE Alliance, a consortium of states 
dedicated to providing those living with disabilities 
and their families with low-cost investment 
products  . We s aw an 87% increase in program,

ABLE accounts are state-sponsored saving and

disabilities and their families to save and invest 
private assets for disability-related expenses 
without losing, or losing access to, federal-means 
tested benefits, such as Supplemental Security 
Income, Medicaid, HUD, SNAP and other benefits  .*
VETERANS
Fifth Third salutes those who serve our country  . 
We are proud of our long history of supporting 
veterans, especially those who are Fifth Third 
employees  . Our enhanced paid military leave 
guidelines provide for 30 days of paid military 
leave per year and provide paid leave for any 
kind of military service , not just active duty, a 
distinction many companies do not make  .
The guidelines were driven by feedback from 
the Bank’s Military Business Resource Group, an 
active group of employee veterans and allies 
that advocate for military personnel—both 
inside the Company and out—and is visible in the 
community through the year  .SPOTLIGHT 
Honoring Military Members
Fifth Third’s military business resource 
groups across our footprint honor veterans 
in a variety of ways each year, including 
observing holidays such as Memorial Day 
and Veterans Day  .
The Military BRG in Western Michigan has a 
tradition of marking Memorial Day each year 
by setting up a table to honor prisoners of 
war and those missing in action  . Th e table, 
known as a Missing Man Table or Fallen 
Comrade Table, is a semi-official place of 
honor in some dining facilities of the U  .S . 
armed forces  . Th e table is set for one but is 
in memory of all fallen, missing in action or 
prisoner of war military service members  . 
The tradition of the table dates back to the 
Vietnam War  . Th e BRG displays the table the 
week before Memorial Day and performs an 
official ceremony at the operations center in 
Grand Rapids  .
“While we had to scale back our Memorial Day 
activities in 2020 due to the pandemic, we 
still displayed the table and held an official 
ceremony,” said Sean Murphy, SBA Product 
Specialist II  . “A ttendance was slightly lower 
but we had a nice turnout, and those who 
attended were touched that we upheld 
this tradition  .”
Like Memorial Day, activities for Veterans Day 
shifted because of the pandemic  . Kn owing 
that veterans at the Grand Rapids Home 
for Veterans could not have visitors due to 
CDC guidelines, the Military BRG in Western 
Michigan partnered with the facility to bring 
some good cheer to the residents  . BR G members and students from local schools 
made greeting cards and collected coloring 
books and puzzle books  . “Du ring such an 
uncertain and isolating time, the veterans 
really appreciated the handmade cards and 
activity books,” Murphy said  .
Throughout the year, our BRGs also provide 
support and development opportunities 
for employees  . Fo r example, the Enterprise 
Military BRG hosts a session for all employees 
to learn more about the Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center  . Th e session features speakers 
from local veterans organizations who  
touch on topics such as eligibility, suicide 
prevention and education, veterans services 
and VA centers  .
We’re proud to have paid military leave 
guidelines to support our employees who 
serve in the uniformed services  . De veloped 
in part with input from our Military BRG, the 
guidelines provide for up to 30 days of paid 
military leave and a pay differential of up to 
24 months  . Fi fth Third also honors military 
personnel, including those on active duty, in 
the Reserve or National Guard, and veterans, 
and we offer current and former U  .S . mi litary 
members Fifth Third Military Banking 
and Checking  . *Certain limitations may apply based on applicable state or federal law.

INCLUSION COUNCILS AND BUSINESS 
RESOURCE GROUPS 
Our inclusion councils and business resource 
groups give employees opportunities for 
networking, learning and personal growth ,  
as well as an outlet to volunteer and serve  
the community  .
We operate 13 inclusion councils and 64 local 
BRGs  . Senior executives also lead eight virtual 
Enterprise BRGs that enable all employees to 
participate regardless of their work location—
greatly expanding access for employees with 
alternative work arrangements and those 
who work outside of our core Consumer Bank 
footprint  . Ea ch BRG focuses on three pillars: 
employee development, community involvement 
and business innovation  .
The onset of the pandemic in March 2020 
disrupted BRG events, but it did not stop our 
BRGs from participating in networking and 
development opportunities, celebrating their 
heritage and supporting each other  in virtual settings  . No t only did that show how employees 
lead with agility, it also demonstrated our 
commitment to inclusion and diversity through 
challenging times  . Ev ent highlights included:
• A virtual town hall in May 2020 brought all 
our Enterprise BRGs together to check in with each other and focus on how the groups could 
continue to thrive during the pandemic  . 
• June commemorated Pride Month, and the LGBT+ Enterprise BRG held a virtual celebration  in lieu of the in-person parades, 
marches and festivals normally held each year  . 
Participants heard from Fifth Third leaders and a representative from PFLAG National (Parents, 
Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays)  . 
Participants also had the opportunity to engage 
with their peers in a trivia game  .
• Western Michigan’s Military BRG members partnered with the Corporate Service Center campus, the local Young Professionals BRG and local schools to create handmade cards and collect donations for residents of the Grand Rapids Home for Veterans. 
• The Asian and Pacific Islander BRG in Cincinnati held a virtual celebration for Diwali , the festival of lights celebrated by 
religions founded in India  . 
• Chicago’s African American BRG celebrated Black History Month with nationally-renowned 
artist Brian Washington  . Washington 
displayed some of his artwork and a few Fifth Third leaders hosted a conversation about Washington’s collection called “The Continuous Struggle.” Fifth Third’s BRGs

STRENGTHENING SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
Supplier diversity is a strategic imperative at 
the Bank and was recognized as such in 2015 
with the establishment of a formal supplier 
diversity program. Diverse suppliers are 
relevant in every aspect of our business  . We a re 
committed to identifying potential additional 
suppliers, providing access to financing for 
undercapitalized businesses and investing in

developed a multi-year plan for the growth and 
expansion of these efforts  . It i ncludes educating, 
training and developing Black-owned and other 
minority-owned, veteran-owned, and woman- 
owned small businesses  . The work is intended 
to build a more robust pipeline, educate on 
the request-for-proposal process and support 
suppliers with technical assistance and training. 
Fifth Third also supports programs that assist 
diverse suppliers in accessing capital and internal 
support so they can compete for the Bank’s 
business on a fair and equal basis  .In 2020, the Bank’s spending with certified 
Minority Business Enterprises increased 
176%, and spending with Black suppliers grew 
47%. Notably, Fifth Third onboarded a certified 
Minority Business Enterprises provider to support 
staffing program management, add value to our 
processes and provide us with a competitive 
advantage in the financial services industry  . Th is 
relationship enables us to optimize all talent 
channels by engaging the right people, at the 
right cost, at the right time  .

sustainable value for all we 
serve, Fifth Third strives to 
engage, develop, retain and 
attract a thriving workforce  .
We believe an engaged workforce is one of 
our most valuable assets  . When we keep our 
employees’ development and well-being at 
the center of our decisions and actions, our 
employees, in turn, keep our customers at the 
center of everything they do. 
INSPIRING AND ENABLING EMPLOYEES 
TO THRIVE
Banking is a business first and foremost 
grounded in the relationships between customers 
and our most valuable asset—our employees  . 
Our success begins with them and they make 
the difference in our ability to be the One Bank 
people most value and trust  . 
In exchange for sharing their talents, skills and 
commitment, we offer employees competitive 
pay, robust health and wellness benefits, 
innovative programs like concierge services and 
an inclusive culture that inspires and enables 
them to thrive  . As engaged, high performing and skilled employees continue to seek more value 
from their employers, the Human Capital division announced four strategic 
priorities in 2020 to respond proactively to the evolving work environment 
and workforce, strengthen our culture and continue engaging, developing, 
retaining and attracting top talent:
DEVELOP GREAT LEADERS
Accelerate our leaders’ capabilities 
to drive success and empowerment 
in an increasingly diverse workforce 
and digital environment  .EVOLVE THE EMPLOYEE 
EXPERIENCE
Evolve our employee value 
proposition to ensure it clearly 
defines and delivers an ecosystem 
of support, recognition and values 
to inspire improved retention, 
engagement and business outcomes  .
EQUALITY, EQUITY & 
INCLUSION
Accelerate the development of an 
inclusive workplace and diverse 
workforce strategy. Provide additional 
opportunities for our diverse suppliers 
and continue to support our employees 
in building diverse customer relationships  .FUTURE OF WORK
Develop and execute innovative  
workforce and workplace solutions 
for sustained business, employee 
and community success  .
Human Capital’s strategic priorities allow us not only to deliver for 
employees and customers but also to help make Fifth Third an employer of 
choice in every market where we do business  .

OUR CULTURE AND EMPLOYEE 
ENGAGEMENT
The Fifth Third 
Compass symbolizes 
our culture  . Ou r 
Compass clearly 
communicates who 
we are, what we 
believe, how we 
deliver value and 
how we interact 
with others  . The 
Compass is so 
important in our culture that it is intentionally 
and regularly reinforced through employee 
communications and training, engagement 
initiatives, performance reviews and metrics 
as well as our everyday actions, processes and 
business controls.
The Human Capital division used the Compass 
as a guide to develop its four strategic priorities 
listed on page 70  of this report  . Ea ch priority 
helps our culture to evolve and strengthens 
employee engagement  . 
MAKING EMPLOYEES’ VOICES HEARD
Listening to and learning from employees stands at 
the heart of Fifth Third’s culture and commitment 
to provide employees a work environment in 
which they can be and do their best  . That is 
why Fifth Third uses a holistic approach to 
collecting employee feedback and measuring employee engagement regularly  and at critical 
points through each employee’s Fifth Third career  . 
Fifth Third’s Board of Directors and executive 
management assess employee engagement on 
a regular basis by collecting employee feedback, 
primarily through our annual engagement survey 
and various pulse surveys  . In 2020, positive survey 
results earned us an Energage Top Workplace 
Award in 10 of our regions. More important than 
the recognition are the insights and actions that we 
glean from our contact with employees  . We u se this 
feedback to continuously improve the employee 
experience and, ultimately, our business  .
In 2020, due to the pandemic, we performed 
more frequent pulse surveys instead of 
conducting our annual employee engagement 
survey  . In our latest annual engagement survey 
in 2019, our engagement score for customer-
facing employees was 74%  . Th is score was up 4 
percentage points over 2018 and put us in the 
top quartile for this employee segment based 
on companies that use the methodology of our 
survey partner, Kincentric  . We e xpect to return to 
our annual survey in 2021  . We deployed two 
COVID-19 pulse 
surveys in May and 
August because it 
was critical to gather 
employee feedback and 
continuously listen as 
the situation evolved. 
The pulse surveys focused on leadership, 
communications, collaboration, employee 
safety and well-being, and productivity 
as we navigated our evolving work 
environment and processes  . 
In these surveys, employees indicated 
that they received a high level of manager 
support, had an understanding of the 
steps being taken for their well-being, were getting information they needed 
and that their current work arrangements allowed them to collaborate effectively 
and be productive  .
For more information about our 
COVID-19 response pertaining to 
employees, see page 51 .
71  |  FIFTH THIRD BANCORP 2020 ESG REPORT CONTENTS INTRODUCTION ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT INDEXSOCIAL
In addition to gathering employee feedback 
during key moments or events, we also collect 
employee feedback three times during the 
onboarding process, as well as when employees 
leave the Bank  . W ith this rich set of employee 
data, we identify key themes to drive meaningful 
strategic and cultural improvements  .
In 2020, employee engagement at 30 days was 
90% (92% in 2019)—11 percentage points above 
the national average  . A t 90 days, engagement 
was at 87% (85% in 2019), 8 percentage points 
higher than the national average  . Our exit survey results show that advocacy, which 
indicates the likelihood that an employee would 
continue to be a supporter of the Company or 
return to Fifth Third in the future, was 69%, up 
4 percentage points from 2019 and 11% percent 
higher than the national average  . 
Our 30- and 90-day onboarding surveys 
use the same statements to measure 
engagement  as we use in our annual 
employee engagement survey  . T hey are:
• It would take a lot to get me to leave this organization.
• I would not hesitate to recommend this organization to a friend seeking employment.
• Fifth Third inspires me to do my best work every day.
• I rarely think about leaving this organization to work somewhere else.
• Given the opportunity, I tell others great things about working here.
• Fifth Third motivates me to contribute more than is normally required to complete my work.2020 Employee Engagement

GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES
Learning and development programs at Fifth 
Third are built upon a growth mindset, the 
belief that everyone’s skills and capabilities 
can be enhanced through dedication and work 
inspired by a thirst for learning. 
We believe that learning and development 
must be accessible to meet a range of needs 
for employees and address a work environment 
in which skills need to evolve rapidly  . Th us, 
we offer a rich mix of education, experiences, 
exposure, and tools necessary to expand 
knowledge and skills  .
Each year, Fifth Third requires all employees 
and contingent/contract workers to complete 
a series of courses related to risk and 
compliance. Together, these courses support 
strong risk management behaviors and teach 
employees how to be accountable for managing 
risk . Compliance officers and executives of each 
line of business approve all training specific 
to an employee’s role  . A se t of courses launch 
each quarter and employees are allotted time 
to complete the comprehensive courses during working hours  . Ne w employees, whether new 
to Fifth Third or to a particular position through transfer or promotion are assigned courses 
differently from existing employees  . Our Doing 
the Right Thing course consists of eight 
modules linked to our Core Values, Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics and the ways we 
manage risk while interacting with and serving 
customers. 
In 2020, voluntary, on-demand learning 
opportunities increased and gave employees 
the opportunity to take advantage of three 
different resources  . LinkedIn Learning  offers 
courses across business, technology and creative categories; Harvard ManageMentor  is 
a learning and performance support resource 
for critical management skills; and Pluralsight , 
a technology skills-based platform, focuses 
on today’s most in-demand technologies and 
tools  . These resources are connected through a 
user-friendly learning experience platform called 
Degreed  . De greed provides a single, fluid skill 
development experience, powered by artificial 
intelligence and aimed at building skills for both 
today and the future  . 
In 2020, employees at Fifth Third completed nearly 755,000 
hours of training, an average of 36.6 hours per employee,  
up 12% from 2019.In 2020, 99.7% of all required 
compliance training modules 
were completed by employees. 
Courses included:
• Complaint Management
• Financial Crimes Compliance Training
• Elder Financial Abuse
• Privacy Compliance Basics
• Information Lifecycle Governance
• Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
• Doing the Right Thing at  Fifth Third Bank (8 modules)
—Applying the Code of Conduct  
and Ethics
—Managing Information and Data
—Creating a Safe Cyber Environment—Processing Credit Cards Securely—Business Continuity—Preventing Fraud —Responsible Banking and Fair 
Lending Basics
—Volcker Rule and Canada’s  
Anti-Spam Legislation
Fifth Third’s required risk and 
compliance courses support strong risk 
management behaviors and educate all 
employees, in all positions, on how to be 
accountable for managing risk.

As part of Human Capital’s strategic priority 
to develop great leaders, Fifth Third has 
purposefully established a set of four Leader 
Capabilities that align to our Company’s Vision, Core Values and strategic priorities, and that 
improve our leaders’ abilities to drive success 
and empowerment in an increasingly diverse 
workforce and digital environment  . Th e 
capabilities are: Create Connections, Be a Great 
Coach, Lead with Agility and Act Like an Owner. 
In 2020, we launched a series of comprehensive 
Leader Capabilities learning journeys  . Each  
learning journey includes self-guided, online 
training and resources as well as an instructor-
led, virtual learning simulation  . Th e immersive 
simulations require leaders to demonstrate 
their leader capabilities while grappling 
with some of the most difficult and defining 
challenges they will likely face  as the Company 
continues to evolve and transform  . The learning journeys, along with learning cafés, 
provide managers with flexible opportunities to 
focus on building skills, socialize and collaborate 
with other leaders and deepen their knowledge 
on key topics through group interactions such as 
discussion boards and debrief sessions  .

though it was virtual. I was

WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP
Our Women in Leadership program is an avenue 
for addressing gender imbalance in leadership 
positions. It is an integrated development 
experience for high-performing senior female 
leaders who have significant impact on the Bank’s 
success  . The program is focused on accelerating 
readiness to lead at the next level and, ultimately, 
the C-suite  . Since its inception in 2015, 40 
women leaders have participated in the program , 
including 10 who graduated in March 2020  . Of  
those, 50% of program graduates have received a 
promotion or expanded their responsibilities, skills 
and experience through new roles  . 
Participants are challenged to look inward, 
outward and forward to apply their leadership 
capabilities through skill-building, coaching 
and exposure to enhance business outcomes  . 
Through this experience, these female leaders 
gain insight to lead authentically through 
understanding and promotion of their distinctive 
strengths and talents  . Wo men in Leadership 
alumnae stay connected with each other, build 
community within the Bank and continue to work 
on their development plans  .
Being intentional and transparent in our 
investment in women benefits not only the 
women in the program, but the Company as a whole, others who aspire to the program and the 
sponsors who invest in program participants  . SPOTLIGHT
Peg Jula, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer
Fifth Third’s C-suite is markedly different 
than it was in 1991, the year Peg Jula joined  
the organization. “There were very few 
women leaders when I arrived, and those who were in higher-level roles felt an enormous 
amount of pressure to succeed, not only for 
themselves but also in serving as mentors 
and sponsors for the rest of us,” said Jula  . 
Since then, Jula has held numerous roles of 
increasing responsibility  . In 2 014 she was 
named director of business controls for 
Human Capital  . Sh e also led HC Operations 
& Shared Services, mergers and acquisitions, 
strategic project management, HC analytics, 
process improvement and Enterprise 
Operating Rhythms  . 
Jula participated in Fifth Third’s Women in 
Leadership program in 2019-20  . Sh ortly after 
completing the program, she was promoted 
to executive vice president and chief human 
resources officer  . Sh e credits the dedicated 
time in WIL for strengthening her executive 
leadership skills and preparing her for this 
stage of her career  . 
“Fifth Third has a goal of developing women 
to become top-level leaders, including the 
C-suite,” she said  . “W hile we’ve seen progress 
over the last decade, we also know that 
without constant focus and vigilance, not only 
do we risk losing our momentum, we also risk 
losing the gains we’ve made  . As the CHRO, I 
look for ways to create new and emerging leadership roles for women so that we can 
attract, develop and retain an incredible and 
diverse talent pool at Fifth Third.”   
Fifth Third currently has five women in 
the C-suite, all with diverse backgrounds, 
experience, working styles and approaches to 
the business  .
“The more women we have in leadership 
roles, the more others will value and respect women as diverse individuals with 
unique strengths, expertise and career 
journeys,”
 said Jula  . “W e are not all the 
same, nor do we operate in the same way 
just because we are women, and that’s a 
very good thing  . WI L showed me that, as 
an alumna, I can use what I’ve learned to be a sponsor for other women – to help them 
express their authentic selves and to remove 
the obstacles that have historically impeded a 
woman’s journey to the C-suite  .”

DEVELOPING TOMORROW’S TALENT 
TODAY
For over 30 years, Fifth Third has advocated early 
career support for individuals seeking careers in 
financial services  . Early career opportunities at 
Fifth Third include both direct-hire roles and 10 
leadership trainee programs. The early career 
roles provide foundational knowledge, skills and 
experience for recent college graduates  . We  
offer students and recent graduates internships 
and full-time positions with opportunities to gain 
unparalleled business experience and the chance 
to contribute and grow  . Op portunities are offered 
in the following business areas: Audit, Commercial, 
Consumer, Finance and Accounting, IT, Operations, 
Risk Management, Wealth & Asset Management, 
Strategic Projects and Analytics, Data Analytics, 
Human Capital, and Community Development and 
Social Responsibility  .
Early career programs also provide exposure 
to our business through rotational experiences, 
including structured education to develop 
leadership capabilities; exposure to seasoned 
performers, senior leaders and other early 
career learners; and resources to support strong 
performance and development  .Over a two-year period, participants have 
access to formal learning programs, such as 
consultative skills, building relationships using 
DiSC® assessments, emotional intelligence and 
presentation skills  . Th ey also participate in the 
Connect@53 challenge, which helps them establish 
their first 53 connections at the Bank  . We a lso 
support their growth and development through 
our business resource groups and structured 
community service and volunteerism opportunities  .
EDUCATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Fifth Third encourages employees to enroll in 
outside education programs to broaden their 
knowledge and help with their job performance  . 
We provide assistance for external education in 
addition to our internal learning and development 
offerings to help employees hone existing skills 
and acquire new ones in areas that align with 
business goals  .
Fifth Third offers tuition reimbursement to 
full- and part-time employees of up to $5,250 
and $2,500 per calendar year, respectively  . 
Additionally, relationships with Western Governors 
University and the University of Phoenix mean 
employees can take advantage of discounted 
tuition rates as they work toward their degrees  .
Early career roles provide foundational 
knowledge, skills and experience for 
recent college graduates.PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
Our performance management process 
aims to positively impact and optimize 
both employee and organizational 
performance.  It is grounded in our Core 
Values and, for leaders, in our leader 
capabilities  . 
The process highlights the importance of 
managers holding regular performance 
and development conversations to ensure 
employees understand expectations, 
check in on progress and exchange 
feedback  . Th is process culminates with a 
performance review  .
While managers drive many elements of 
the process, employees take an active 
role in engaging in conversations to 
further their development  and achieve 
performance goal results  . 
Guiding principles of these conversations 
include:
• Balance both WHAT and HOW  results are achieved.
• Regularly check in  on progress.
• Prioritize and align work to  
business needs  .
• Openly ask for and accept feedback  .
• Demonstrate a commitment to development.
76  |  FIFTH THIRD BANCORP 2020 ESG REPORT CONTENTS INTRODUCTION ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT INDEXSOCIAL
Our Core Values and leader 
capabilities guide all our 
actions at the Bank and 
ensure accountability for 
achieving the right results in 
the right way.
At year-end, individual performance is 
evaluated against not only what an employee 
accomplished during the year but also how the 
work was done. Our Core Values and Leader 
Capabilities, which reinforce our commitment 
to inclusion, diversity and equality as well as to 
our customers and communities, guide all our 
actions at the Bank and ensure accountability 
for achieving the right results in the right way  . 
In addition to evaluating and recognizing 
performance from the past year, managers and 
employees have the opportunity to focus on the 
future by identifying the right performance and 
development priorities for the new year  .TALENT REVIEW
Our approach to talent management is 
achieved through our annual talent review 
process and periodic updates  . Be ginning with 
a scan of the business landscape and strategic 
business objectives, talent reviews focus on 
understanding business needs, assessing 
employee potential, determining bench 
strength, identifying capability gaps and 
creating targeted development actions. 
Succession planning occurs at the senior 
leadership level to ensure a pipeline of 
capable leaders who can meet short and 
long-term business needs and minimize 
vacancy risk for critical roles  . Addi tional 
business value for pipeline development 
includes intentional focus on talent actions to 
accelerate readiness of successors  .
Executive talent and succession planning for 
the direct reports of the CEO is managed 
by the CEO and CHRO and reviewed at least 
annually (and more frequently as needed) 
with the Board of Directors  . The talent review process is facilitated by 
the Human Capital team with the following 
intended outcomes:
• Identify employees with greater 
potential  so that we can provide targeted 
development that solves for talent gaps  .
• Hold managers accountable for providing ongoing feedback, coaching and development.
• Provide targeted feedback to our high-potential talent  to accelerate their 
development and deepen their engagement  . 
• Focus on increasing representation of diverse talent.
• Strive to increase talent portability for business needs  and to provide 
developmental experiences  .
• Ensure succession planning is in place in order to adjust and adapt quickly as 
needed  .

COMPENSATION
As part of our ongoing commitment to inclusion 
and diversity, Fifth Third’s total compensation 
programs are grounded in a philosophy that 
ensures all employees are paid fairly and 
equitably, and in compliance with the law. 
Our pay philosophy is designed to: 
• Attract and retain top talent and  high performers  that will drive our 
business strategy; 
• Effectively manage risk within incentive programs  designed to pay  
for performance; 
• Consider applicable regulatory expectations as well as our corporate values and behavioral expectations  
when making compensation awards; 
• Align with the creation of long-term shareholder value.
We continuously analyze our pay, accounting 
for factors like employee role, tenure, time in 
position and geography  . Our analysis shows that, 
on average, women are paid more than 99% of what men are paid, and minorities are paid 
more than 99% of what non-minorities are paid
 . 
We also continuously analyze our compensation programs and practices to help ensure that all 
employees have equal opportunity to maximize 
their potential  . In t he unlikely event we encounter 
a pay disparity that is not explained by job-
related factors, an adjustment is made  . 
Annually, we use competitive benchmarking 
data provided by top industry consultants to 
ensure the ongoing competitiveness of our total compensation program, including base salary 
ranges and short and long-term incentives  . 
In 2019, we increased our minimum hourly 
wage from $15 to $18. This benefited 
approximately 4,900 employees —nearly 25% of 
our workforce—primarily in retail branches and operations functions such as customer contact 
centers  . In our Ohio, Michigan and Illinois regions, 
our minimum wage is up to 200% higher than the 
state minimum wage*  . It r epresents an additional 
investment by the Bank of approximately $15 
million per year to help our employees succeed at 
work and at home  . 
Fifth Third also continues to honor a footprint-
wide ban on salary history , which means that we 
will not ask for a candidate’s current salary to use 
as a factor in determining an employment offer  . 
This approach enables us to immediately reduce 
historical gender or racial pay inequities  .Employee Health & Wellness 
Accolades
Our commitment to our employees’ 
physical, financial and personal health and 
well-being have resulted in recognition by 
the following organizations in 2020:
American Heart Association

RECRUITING THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST
Attracting diverse and bright talent is 
essential to our success.  The combination 
of competitive compensation, best-in-class 
benefits, innovative programs that foster work-
life balance, financial rewards for physical and 
financial wellness activities and the Bank’s 
reputation for being a business and community 
leader forms an attractive value proposition for 
prospective employees  .
We invest significant resources into 
finding the best possible candidates  
and to ensuring that the diversity of our 
workforce reflects the communities we 
serve  . Our talent acquisition strategy 
works to:
• Help source and hire effectively and 
efficiently.
• Use advanced technology to identify, influence and attract top talent.
• Advise and consult with leaders to 
develop strong recruiting strategies  .
• Offer a robust pipeline of qualified and diverse candidates  
to decision-makers  .For several decades, the Bank has worked closely 
with colleges and universities across our footprint 
to recruit and hire the best and brightest students  . 
Our strategy also emphasizes internships and long-
term employment through various early career 
roles that provide a talent pipeline for professional 
roles across the organizations  .
DIVERSE RECRUITING AND HIRING
Our diversity recruiting outreach strategy 
enables us to build strong relationships with a 
qualified diverse applicant pool that reflects the demographics of our markets through a focus 
on women, minority and LGBTQ populations, 
individuals with disabilities and veterans  . 
Part of this strategy includes relationships with 
key regional and community-based organizations 
and connections with diverse student 
organizations on campuses in our local markets  . 
The pandemic prompted the need to enhance 
virtual relationships and outreach  . In 2020, 
we established virtual relationships with 
organizations like Cincinnati State Technical 
and Community College, the Cincinnati 
Diversity & Inclusion Career Fair, Ohio Means 
Jobs, University of Illinois-Chicago and the 
University of Toledo. We also fostered a virtual 
relationship with the Urban Financial Services 
Coalition and held information sessions via Zoom 
so coalition members could more easily network 
with potential recruits  . Our strong partnership with People Scout Talent 
Solutions , a recruitment process outsourcing 
provider, ensures that we engage with a diverse 
candidate population, specifically for our call 
center, banking center and select regional positions  . 
This partnership provides talent acquisition 
services for professional and nonprofessional 
positions that solve compliance, scalability, cost, 
quality and other recruiting challenges  .
We also introduced a partnership with 
Diversityjobs.com  to engage with a target 
market of diverse candidates, established a relationship with the Virginia Employment 
Commission, shared new mortgage employment 
opportunities within a new market in Richmond, 
Indiana and advertised our virtual career fairs  .

Collaborative 
Partnerships Fuel the 
Pipeline
Collaborative partnerships like the 
one we have with the University of 
Cincinnati support our recruiting 
strategy.  Fifth Third opened space in 
UC’s 1819 Innovation Hub to strengthen 
our collaboration with the university and 
its students as well as other regional 
companies  . 
The 1819 Hub is regarded as the university’s 
front door to the region, where businesses can 
connect directly with UC faculty and students. 
This relationship inspires new ways of working 
and enables us to partner with thought leaders 
and research capabilities within UC, while building 
deeper relationships with students, leading to 
potential hiring  .In 2020, we strengthened our talent pipeline 
as Fifth Third University Relations partnered 
more closely with 1819 Corporate Relations  . 
The partnership led to two new virtual 
student-engagement events that focused 
on women in technology and diversity and 
inclusion, respectively  .
Connecting with student organizations in 
the computer and data sciences space led to the hiring of our Enterprise Data Office’s first 
co-op from UC. This co-op relationship was a 
success and will expand in 2021, with our data 
office employing multiple UC co-op students  . 
In November 2020, Fifth Third’s Innovation 
team conducted a first-of-its-kind joint 
corporate innovation challenge  . P artnering 
with fellow 1819 building partner Kroger 
Technology, this virtual event brought 
together 39 UC students from six different 
colleges and 50 employees from the two companies to innovate at the intersection of 
banking and grocery retailing, two key pillars 
of consumers’ lives  . Our Innovation team also participated in 
two separate five-week Innovation Studios, 
led by UC faculty. Students from multiple 
disciplines worked in teams on specific 
business challenges provided by Fifth Third  . 
In a debrief after the studios, one student 
noted that the experience “turned my view 
around about the banking world” and another 
stated that, “I always assumed banking was a 
one-way conversation where a customer asks 
for help  . I d idn’t picture the bank reaching out 
to customers proactively  . K nowing the bank 
has an innovation department is really cool  .” 
“Knowing the bank has an 
innovation department is 
really cool.”

INTERNSHIPS
Fifth Third typically hosts 50 to 100 summer 
interns each year  . Th ese internships allow 
students to gain valuable experience in the 
financial services industry and help train 
them for a future career  with Fifth Third  . In 
2020, due to quarantine and social distancing 
restrictions, we pivoted to allow 86 interns across 
15 departments to work with us remotely  . 
In addition to assigned work, we introduced a 
10-week learning plan to enable our interns to 
learn about banking and develop foundational 
knowledge and skills important for leaders at 
Fifth Third Bank  . Int erns also got the opportunity 
to hear from our executives and learn about each 
other through virtual networking and capstone

and Security
Fifth Third is committed to ensuring 
the safety of our customers, 
employees and the physical 
security of our banking centers and 
workplace.  It is a responsibility we 
take very seriously  . 
Our integrated security program includes:
• Process  for physical security assessments  .
• Methodology  for determining physical 
security needs  .
• Deployment  of necessary and appropriate 
physical security countermeasures  .
• Procedures  for reviewing and evaluating 
physical security  .
The chief security officer is responsible for 
the physical security of all Bank employees, 
customers and facilities  . Ou r Physical 
Security team manages on-site security 
guards and also manages the Bank’s 
security operations center, which maintains 
a 24/7 call center and monitors over 
20,000 cameras and alarms across Bank 
facilities, emergency notification channels 
to employees and serves as a centralized 
response group for all security issues  .
Additionally, Fifth Third uses the American 
Bankers Association’s Toolbox on Bank Robbery Deterrence  to conduct periodic risk and security assessments at its banking 
centers  . This industry evaluation tool defines 
a standard scoring methodology that results 
in an overall physical security risk score for a 
location  . Fi fth Third implements consistent 
and appropriate physical security steps based 
upon a calculated security risk score  .
Physical Security also regularly reviews 
the external and internal influences that 
impact its physical security program  . Th ese 
influences include the overall security 
environment, applicable laws and regulations 
and emerging technology  . 
Fifth Third security uses open source 
intelligence gathering systems to identify 
early signals of high-impact events and emerging risks  to respond with confidence 
and manage crises more effectively  . Th ese 
reviews provide information for Fifth Third 
to adjust its security program as needed to ensure that it meets its strategic goal of 
ensuring a safe and secure environment for our customers and employees that enhances 
our business objectives  .

in 2016 as a $27  .5 bill ion plan over five years  . 
Later that year, that amount was increased to 
$30 billion upon consultation with hundreds of 
community groups and the National Community 
Reinvestment Coalition  . In 2018, the Bank 
expanded the commitment to $32 billion in 
consideration of its planned expansion in Chicago  .  
“The community benefits agreement we 
established with Fifth Third Bank in 2016 was one of our first and largest,” said Jesse Van Tol, 
CEO of the National Community Reinvestment

Community Needs 
Assessment
It is important that we partner with 
our communities so that we can serve 
them in the most effective, impactful 
and sustainable ways  with the right 
combination of access to programs, 
products and services as well as 
philanthropy and volunteerism  . W e do 
this through our annual Community 
Needs Assessment  . 
The CNA is a standard method that helps us 
determine the needs of the communities that 
Fifth Third Bank serves. It is an annual collection 
and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data 
to help inform the Bank of opportunities in 
local and regional lending, and investments and 
service, particularly in low- and moderate-income 
areas  . I t also assists us in the development of 
responsive strategies to address the needs 
identified within the Bank’s defined focus areas  .
In 2020, we surveyed our community partners 
to develop comprehensive solutions that 
address our community’s most essential 
needs related to access to capital, workforce 
development and building capacity.  Fifth Third 
partnered with Maru/Matchbox, a global market 
research company, to survey approximately 140 
community partners over a three-week period

The 2020 assessment demonstrated that 
the top challenges for most communities 
continued to be affordable housing, 
poverty and the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic.  COVID-19, along with racial 
inequity and social injustice, highlighted and 
reemphasized needs that already existed in 
partner communities  .  
Critical needs were identified:
• Access to capital
• Workforce development 
• Building capacityAmong the community’s most essential 
needs, access to capital was the most urgent  . 
Community partners believe focused 
improvements in the areas of stringent 
capital requirements, policies that create 
inequality and the lack of initial funds 
would have a great impact. For workforce 
development, our community partners 
suggested that more emphasis on education 
and job training would yield successful 
improvements for the community  . F or building 
capacity, community partners urged programs 
that will assist in funding staff and training  . 
The information gleaned from the CNA 
confirmed the direction of the work of our community and economic development 
offices throughout our Company  .

Inclusion
The more individuals, families 
and small businesses are 
empowered to achieve 
their best lives, the more 
communities thrive  . 
We want to help people reach their full 
potential  . We b elieve this will have a long-lasting, 
generational impact in the neighborhoods, towns 
and cities we serve, especially among low- and 
moderate-income Americans, by reversing 
negative cycles and building strong foundations 
for the future  .  
We work to deliver comprehensive and 
innovative solutions to challenges facing the 
people who live in the communities we serve. 
We’re tackling low homeownership rates in 
underserved communities, diminished access 
to capital for small businesses seeking to start 
or expand, and a gap in financial education and 
workforce development  .SMALL BUSINESSES
We are committed to small businesses 
because we know they are essential 
to strong and economically vibrant 
communities.  Our direct support of small 
businesses includes loans and lines of credit 
as well as service products  . 
We are a U.S. Small Business Administration 
Preferred Lender  that offers our clients 
several types of SBA loans, including 7(a), 
Express and 504 loans  . SB A loans typically 
have more flexible borrowing amounts 
and repayment options than traditional 
loans, which usually leads to lower monthly 
payments  . SB A loans are used for working 
capital, equipment financing and commercial 
real estate, and everything in between  .
In 2020, Fifth Third increased staffing for its 
national SBA team, including eight full-time 
employees  in the fourth quarter, to support 
our SBA lending and processing capabilities  . 
The investment is part of the Bank’s goal 
to become a leader in the delivery of SBA 
loan products  . Fi fth Third also invested in 
technology to assist in processing loans in 
both our Commercial and Retail channels  .
We expect increases in loan volumes as our investments in digital technology and people 
enable us to collaborate with more small businesses  to help them expand operations  . We 
are also actively growing SBA partnership lending through relationships with community 
development financial institutions and community development corporations  . To become a leader in

Small Business Pandemic Support
Addressing the needs of small businesses during 
the pandemic was critical for Fifth Third Bank 
in 2020  . We had a No. 53 Small Business 
Administration ranking prior to the pandemic, 
and yet we became the No. 13 top Paycheck 
Protection Program lender in 2020. This was 
a testament to our commitment to helping our 
existing customers secure necessary funding and 
provide financial assistance during their most 
challenging time  .
In 2020, we provided $5.4 billion in PPP loans to 
our clients , 85% of which were for loans less than 
$150,000  . N inety-five percent of the companies 
that received loans had fewer than 50 employees  . As part of our small business lending COVID-19 
response, we reached out to clients for hardship 
support, guidance on hardship requests and loan 
modifications  . W e provided payment deferrals 
up to 90 days, waiving late fees and providing 
loan modification options for small businesses in 
need  . W e also waived select fees for 90 days on 
business banking deposit accounts and services  . 
Further, we worked with the SBA to ensure that 
qualified SBA borrowers of 7(a) and Express Loans 
were able to participate in the Loan Payment 
Relief Program  . S BA committed to making 
monthly payments on their behalf for six months  .  
Coaching and Technical Assistance
In addition to lending, we also place a high value 
on helping customers navigate the small business 
ecosystem, which can be complex and difficult, especially for Black-, women- and other minority-owned businesses. We know that resources 
beyond Fifth Third’s are available and see it as our 
duty to help them access those resources  . 
One of the more visible ways we do that is 
through our support of community development 
financial institutions  . CDFIs are private financial 
institutions that are committed to providing 
responsible, affordable capital  to those who 
might not be in a position to use traditional 
banking products or resources  . C DFIs are often 
able to assist small businesses in taking the next 
step in their growth and development by providing 
business coaching and technical assistance  .  We support CDFIs by providing capital to these 
organizations as well as working hand in hand 
with them in the communities that we serve  . We 
have strong partnerships with representative 
CDFIs in the majority of the markets in which 
we operate, including Accion , a global nonprofit 
dedicated to helping small businesses  . 
In 2020, Accion received COVID-19  funding from 
the Fifth Third Foundation and the Fifth Third 
Chicagoland Foundation and the Bank partnered 
with the organization to reach 2,128 small business 
owners through a series of educational webinars 
in May and June  . M ore about these partnerships 
can be found on pages 106 and 107  of this report  .  
We also developed Fifth Third Fast Capital , a new 
digital lending platform designed to help small 
businesses get quick access to needed capital  . 
Phase 1 of the product was launched just prior to 
the COVID-19 pandemic and provided unsecured 
loans of $100,000 or less  . T he next generation 
of the product is expected to include robust 
mobile and digital capabilities  . W e are deeply 
committed to serving small businesses through 
our development and use of enhanced technology  .  
Capital Access Funds
Fifth Third significantly invests in capital access 
funds throughout its footprint  . T hese funds, such 
as Entrepreneurs of Color funds in Detroit and 
Chicago, are designed as new sources of capital 
for businesses owned by entrepreneurs of color 
and businesses that hire primarily people of 
color  . M ore about our work with these funds, 
including businesses helped, is on page 106  .    “I want to thank you sincerely 
for your help with the 
second PPP loan. Every 
time I speak with you, I can 
hear in your voice that you 
care and that you do your 
best every day for your 
customers. It means a lot.”

Response and Recovery 
Initiative 
To ensure the success of small businesses 
in its headquarters city, Fifth Third 
announced the launch of the Greater 
Cincinnati COVID-19 Small Business 
Response and Recovery Initiative in 
December 2020.  The initiative provides 
pandemic-affected small businesses 
of 25 or fewer employees (with an 
emphasis on businesses with five or 
fewer employees) in low-to-moderate 
income communities with advice and 
pathways to gain access to capital via 
the initiative’s loan and grant programs  .Fifth Third has invested an initial $700,000; 
the Greater Cincinnati Foundation invested 
$250,000  . 
The Greater Cincinnati and Northern 
Kentucky African American Chamber of 
Commerce and the Cincinnati USA Regional 
Chamber are founding business service 
organizations providing technical assistance 
to participating businesses  . A dditional 
business service organizations are the Urban 
League of Greater Southwestern Ohio and 
the Greater Cincinnati Microenterprise

• Technical Assistance Program that will assess applicant small business needs, match businesses with recommended assistance via one of the business service organizations participating in the initiative and provide online education 
and resources  .
• Small Business Liquidity Fund to provide responsible loans to small 
businesses ready to receive capital  . 
“Small business owners open their doors 
every day, which allows their employees 
the opportunity to earn wages to take care 
of their families,” said Mike Smith, head of 
business banking for Fifth Third’s Cincinnati

Community Commitment
In 2020, Fifth Third reached the end of its five-
year, $32 billion Community Commitment, which 
included a pledge of $11  .1 bil lion in small business 
loans and other technical support for small 
businesses  . We delivered $12.6 billion in support 
from 2016-2020, exceeding our initial pledge  
by 14%.   
Out of the Community Commitment grew a new 
team of small business community bankers  
whose time and energy is focused as much on 
community leadership and volunteerism as on 
meeting the needs of small business clients  . Th is 
translates directly to a better understanding of the local business environment and the tools—financial 
and otherwise—needed to start or expand small 
businesses  . Ou r team of small business community 
bankers continues to grow and to find creative 
ways to support small businesses as they face a 
challenging and ever-changing economic climate  . 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Affordable housing, or the lack of it, 
continues to be a persistent problem in many 
communities within our footprint. Our suite of 
mortgage products and innovative programs 
like Down Payment Assistance have helped to 
address the gap  .Introduced in 2016, DPA has been a big boost to 
over 4,500 individuals  attempting to achieve the 
American dream of homeownership  . As a b ank, 
we love helping people buy a home, but we also 
keenly understand the impact homeownership 
has on a community’s health and sustainability  . 
In addition to the Bank’s DPA program, our 
mortgage loan officers are always on the lookout 
for ways to combine it with other state and local 
programs so their customers can take advantage 
of grants and other resources for their home 
purchase  .* Since the program’s inception, we’ve 
provided over $14.9 million through DPA.
DPA Success Stories
Carrie Johnson, an MLO in Central Ohio, shared:  
“I met my customer during a homebuyer education 
event  . She put in the hard work of fixing an issue 
on her credit, qualified for the city of Columbus 
program and our down payment assistance 
and went into contract on a home. I attended 
her closing to officially say ‘welcome home  .’ She 
thanked me for never giving up on her and pushing 
her to fulfill this dream  . We b oth cried happy tears!” Natasha Sizemore, an MLO in Middletown, Ohio, 
shared that her client was living in a barn when 
she set out to help him achieve homeownership 
at the age of 61. She was successful, thanks 
in part to the availability of Fifth Third down 
payment assistance funds  . “H e was so 
appreciative that he hugged me and told me that 
he loved me at the closing table  . Th is is the exact 
reason I love being a CRA unit officer!” Victoria Neltner, an MLO in Cincinnati, 
personally drove her customer to and from 
the Job and Family Services office multiple times to secure the paperwork necessary to 
finish his mortgage loan  . “I t took six months,” 
Neltner said, “but I was truly grateful and 
blessed to be able to assist him with his dreams  . 
He is now officially a homeowner  .”

NEIGHBORHOOD REVITALIZATION
Since its inception in 1989, the Fifth Third 
CDC* has invested more than $5 billion in the 
communities Fifth Third serves , including funding 
over 900 projects that focus on affordable 
housing, commercial, retail, office and historic 
buildings; and the creation or preservation of over 
62,250 units of housing  . In 2 020, the CDC funded 
$228 million in projects and closed $395 million  .
These project investments are critical to 
neighborhood stabilization  . Of ten these projects 
are anchors of their communities  . It is common 
for CDC projects to simultaneously preserve a 
historic building, provide affordable housing 
with embedded social services and also provide 
space for commercial, retail or office space.
Notable CDC investments in 2020 included 
$12 million in Bridge Pointe Commons, a 62-
unit permanent supportive housing complex in 
Elyria, Ohio and $4  .4 mil lion in the Martin Farrell 
House apartments in Chicago, which included 59 
affordable housing units  .

Cincinnati Neighborhood Adds 
Affordable Housing, Retail Space 
on City Block 
A city block in Cincinnati’s Over-the-Rhine 
neighborhood is getting a major boost—not to 
mention a significant face lift—with help from 
the Fifth Third CDC  . 
In July 2020, the Fifth Third CDC closed on 
a collaborative, complex and celebrated 
opportunity zone investment known as 
the Willkomen development , a large-scale 
redevelopment of multiple historic buildings 
and new infill construction  . Th e project, in 
the heart of Cincinnati just a mile from iconic 
Fountain Square, comprises the renovation of 
16 historic buildings and the building of four 
new ones  . Alt ogether, the development will 
create 163 residential units and 19,300 square 
feet of commercial space  . Th e project had 
been in the works for more than four years 
and will increase the availability of affordable housing in the community, commercial space 
for local businesses, and jobs  .  
Developed as joint venture between the 
Cincinnati Center City Development Corp  ., 
known as 3CDC, and the Model Group, the 
project utilized new market tax credits, low 
income tax credits, and federal and state 
historic tax credit equity as primary capital 
sources  . Fifth Third CDC invested over $12 
million in the project as the equity investor, 
and Fifth Third Bank provided construction 
and permanent financing  . 
Opportunity zones were created to spur 
economic development and create jobs in 
distressed communities  . Fi fth Third CDC is 
investing $100 million in opportunity zones 
through four development partners created 
as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Dec  . 
22, 2017  . Fo r Willkomen, the Fifth Third CDC 
worked with longtime partner the National 
Equity Fund  .

Logan Towers, an initiative of Talbert 
House, one of the largest social 
services organizations in Cincinnati, 
received $8  .8 mil lion from the CDC 
in 2019  . Construction is expected to 
be complete in 2021  . Wh en it’s done, 
a historic building in Cincinnati’s 
Over-the-Rhine neighborhood will 
house 63 redesigned apartments, 
33 of which will be permanent 
supportive housing units through 
Talbert House  . Th e rest will be 
affordable rental units  . Re nts for the units will be set at 30%, 50% and 60% of 
the area median income  . Th ey also have accessibility features to allow people 
with disabilities to live independently  . 
The Dayton YWCA in Ohio also received CDC funds to assist with the 
redevelopment and reconfiguration of 65 apartment units  . The renovated 
building also will house a domestic violence shelter and space where 
support services—including mental health and chemical dependency 
counseling, vocational programs, money management services, a food pantry, 
transportation assistance, emergency client assistance and a computer lab—
will be available  .
David Thompson, vice president for housing of the Model Group, the 
development construction management firm for the Logan Towers and 
Dayton YWCA projects, explained the importance of collaboration between 
Model Group and our CDC  . “B ringing important community development 
and affordable housing projects like the Dayton YWCA or Logan Towers to 
fruition requires lots of financing and lots of partners,” he said  . “Having Fifth 
Third CDC as a trusted and knowledgeable financing partner gives us 
confidence that we can get these types of complex projects done in a way 
that will benefit the communities they serve. The Model Group has enjoyed 
working with the Fifth Third CDC on multiple high-impact developments and 
looks forward to working with the CDC team in the future  .”SPOTLIGHT 
Collaborations for Community Benefit:  
Operation Hope 
Fifth Third has collaborated with Operation Hope since 2015  . 
Operation Hope works to reduce poverty and empower inclusion 
for low- and moderate-income youth and adults  . In the wake of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, Operation Hope worked to provide financial 
dignity and economic empowerment programming for small 
businesses and low- and moderate-income individuals.   
Operation Hope responded quickly to help the most vulnerable by 
focusing on financial recovery, dignity and inclusion of all Americans  . 
In 2020, Operation Hope received a $100,000 COVID-19 relief 
grant from the Fifth Third Foundation, a $75,000 investment from 
the Bank and 1,640 hours of financial education from Fifth Third. 
This is in addition to years of support dating back to 2016  . Ov erall, 
we have provided over 7,000 hours of financial education services to 
Operation Hope and nearly $800,000 in investments  .
Operation Hope works out of a Hope Inside Financial Empowerment 
Center located in the Northwest Activities Center in Detroit  . Ov er 
the years, Fifth Third has provided millions in capital and operating 
investments to NWAC, including helping the organization secure 
a $95,000 loan through the U  .S . Sm all Business Administration’s 
Paycheck Protection Program so it could retain nine employees 
during the COVID-19 pandemic  . At t he Hope Inside Financial 
Empowerment Center, Fifth Third offers one-on-one financial 
counseling and financial workshops for credit and money 
management and small business  . Th ere’s also an Ideation Computer 
Lab that, before the pandemic, saw 50 visitors per week for adult and 
youth computer classes and summer programs  .
We provided virtual counseling in 2020 through Operation Hope 
that benefited 806 individuals —boosting credit scores of the people 
served by an average of 16 points and savings balances by an average 
of $252  . We a lso helped reduce debt by an average of $1,883  . 
The Fifth Third CDC invested $8.8 million in Logan Towers to restore an historic building and provide supportive housing.

FINANCIAL EDUCATION
Success as an adult is often dependent upon the 
opportunities and advantages individuals have 
when they are young  . Th at’s why we developed 
a suite of programs that offer financial education 
starting in elementary school  . Our Fifth Third 
LIFE (Lives Improved through Financial 
Empowerment®) programs are offered at no 
charge and are designed to educate people in 
personal finance at every age and stage of life. 
Since 2004, Fifth Third has helped educate 2.6 
million people  . 
The Fifth Third Bank Young Bankers Club®, 
developed in 2004, is our signature program  . 
Over the past 16 years, more than 30,000 fifth-
grade students have graduated from YBC  . 
Traditionally, lessons have been taught by Fifth Third volunteers who visited elementary school 
classrooms to teach students  . In F ebruary 2021, 
we launched a digital version of the program  .  
In addition to being redesigned to accommodate 
virtual learning environments, the digital program 
incorporates greater flexibility for teachers  . In  
only 30-45 minutes per week over an eight-week 
period, teachers can help students learn all the 
basics of finance online at any time  . Th e flexibility

ECONOMIC INCLUSION AND  
BANKING DESERTS  
Research has shown the negative impact that 
banking deserts can have on a community  . Wh en 
a bank consolidates and leaves a community, 
small business and mortgage lending can 
decrease for a devastating period of time  . 
To better understand the problem and tackle 
it appropriately, the Bank’s Decision Sciences 
team researched and refined the Federal 
Reserve’s definition of banking deserts so we 
could best determine how to address them, 
including looking at blockgroups instead of 
full census tracts, distance requirements and 
total population thresholds  . The result was 
a more precise look at banking deserts 
within our footprint, representing 5.9 million 
people compared to the old definition, which 
identified just 237,000. With this intelligence, 
our Consumer Bank, Community Development 
and Social Responsibility team and market 
leaders could develop strategies on how we can 
best serve communities  .  
We are committed to opening Fifth Third 
financial centers to serve as many desert 
areas as possible, and have made significant 
progress over the past five years. Our Financial 
Empowerment Mobile strategy helps us fill 
the gaps  . Th e strategy focuses on offering an 
alternative retail delivery format, such as our 
eBus and Banking To Go popup, that supports 
accessibility to financial services in underserved 
communities and on providing products that these communities need  . Si nce 2004, Fifth 
Third has served nearly 500,000 visitors in 
underserved communities  .

Secured Card * is a credit card designed to 
help customers build or rebuild their credit. It 
is a secured card, meaning it is secured by the 
customer placing a $300 refundable deposit

This deposit funds the account and is used to 
determine the borrower’s credit limit to help 
prevent spending beyond the customer’s means  .
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
Helping our customers reach their financial goals 
often means looking beyond bank accounts  . 
That’s why we collaborate with organizations like 
NextJob  and Steady  to ensure our customers

Citizenship & 
Philanthropy
Fifth Third is an integral part 
of the communities we serve— 
not just for the access and 
financial products and services 
we provide, but because our 
employees live, work and 
play in the same cities, towns 
and neighborhoods that our 
customers do  . We wa nt to be 
the best corporate citizen we 
can be  .VOLUNTEERISM
Nothing shows how much we care about 
our communities more than the willingness 
of our hard-working team members to 
donate their time to the causes they care 
about. They become our hands and feet, 
and, in many cases they help maximize 
the financial resources we allocate in 
communities through grants, donations and 
sponsorships  . In 2020, in a year challenged 
by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting 
economic shutdowns, employees logged 
59,727 hours of community service , the 
equivalent of $1,624,574  .  
An October 2020 report from the Center 
for Civil Society Studies at Johns Hopkins 
University stated that nearly one million nonprofit jobs lost during the COVID-19 
pandemic had yet to be recovered  . Not o nly 
was that a challenge for the professionals 
themselves but it also meant diminished 
capacity to meet the increasing needs of the 
community  . Our virtual volunteer program, 
instituted in June 2020, enabled employees 
to search and sign-up for volunteer 
opportunities via computer or smartphone.  
We collaborated with community 
organizations to provide 527 virtual 
volunteer opportunities  for our employees in 
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, 
Ohio and Tennessee  .
Employees volunteered in the areas of 
affordable housing, economic development, 
education, food programs, health and wellness and services for the underserved  . 
Our employees acted as educational tutors, 
organized and contributed to book and 
supply drives, taught financial literacy and 
assembled patient activity kits  .
Further, the Bank ensured that our financial 
education programs for both adults and 
young people were made available online to a 
broad audience  .

CITIZENSHIP
Citizenship requires more than simple 
residence in a place; it requires engagement, 
action and commitment.  We exercise our 
citizenship in communities by being active 
members of them  . We e ngage in regular 
Community Conversations within our footprint to 
ensure we have a pulse on what is happening in 
each community  . Ou r employees serve on various 
boards—from major nonprofits to local school 
and church committees  . As a company, it is our 
job to support our employees’ commitments 
to these organizations by allowing flexible 
work schedules and accommodations when 
necessary  so they can perform these essential 
duties  . We do not view these commitments as 
separate from their roles, but as integral parts of 
our Bank’s commitment to good citizenship  . Ou r 
Human Capital policies, including our military 
leave guidelines, also support this effort  .   
UNITED WAY
In 2020, our 
employees and the 
Fifth Third Foundation 
combined to raise 
over $5 million for 
United Way agencies 
across our footprint. 
Our team members also engaged in virtual United 
Way activities such as walks to support health and 
wellness  . The Bank also was recognized again in 
2020 as one of the top 25 United Way campaigns  
in our headquarters city  . We w ere No  . 2 in 2 020, up 
from No  . 3 in 2 019 .  DISASTER RELIEF 
When disaster strikes, Fifth Third is committed 
to responding strongly and swiftly  . When the 
COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, we 
funded $8.75 million in grants to support relief, 
recovery and resiliency efforts  . We provided 
immediate impact grants to 147 organizations 
like food banks in many of our markets, and we launched major initiatives designed to provide 
support for adversely-affected small businesses 
and displaced workers  .
Our Fifth Third Foundation also responded 
immediately when communities in our footprint 
were affected by severe weather and other 
events  . In 2020, the Fifth Third Foundation 
made a $200,000 grant to the American Red 
Cross after tornadoes ripped through central 
and western Tennessee  and a $10,000 grant to 
the United Way of Midland County to support 
relief efforts for those affected by the floods 
that devastated Midland, Michigan  .  
Fifth Third also works to ensure our employees 
have help when they are in need  . The Fifth Third 
Cares Fund provides short-term, emergency 
support to employees or eligible dependents 
who are facing serious financial hardship as a 
result of certain unforeseen and unpreventable 
circumstances, including natural disasters, 
and who cannot afford housing, utilities and 
other basic living expenses  . Th e Fund also 
allows Company employees the opportunity 
to participate in this effort by contributing to the Fund in support of colleagues who may 
experience such a hardship  . COVID-19 Relief

FEEDING THE HUNGRY
For more than 25 years, Fifth Third has set 
aside May 3 (five/three on the calendar or 
Fifth Third Day) as a time to acknowledge the 
contributions of our employees, thank our 
customers and give back to our communities  . 
For the last several years, we’ve celebrated 
through month-long events and efforts to feed 
our communities  .  
According to Feeding America , 40 million 
Americans—including 12 million children—live in 
households lacking the means to get enough 
nutritious food on a regular basis  . As a r esult, they 
struggle with hunger at some point during the 
year . Food-insecure families exist in every county 
in America—and the situation only worsened as 
unemployment rose during the pandemic  .
In 2020, our event-based Fifth Third Day 
events were affected by the pandemic, but 
our commitment remained  . We provided over 
2.2 million meals through Bank donations to various food organizations across our 11-state 
footprint and beyond.  We also highlighted an 
opportunity for employees to step up to help 
feed our community members through the Step 
Up for Hunger step challenge through Go365  . 
If employees worked together to log 53 million 
steps between May 8-31, the Bank would donate 
an additional $53,000 to Feeding America, an 
amount that would provide 530,000 meals  . Al so, 
employees could donate their Go365 bucks 
to Feeding America, with every $1 donation 
providing 10 meals  . Em ployee enthusiasm also 
dictated that we extend our efforts to fight 
hunger throughout the summer of 2020  .    
PHILANTHROPY
Our bank has a long history of philanthropic 
giving  . The Fifth Third Foundation, established 
over 70 years ago, was the first U  .S . cor porate 
philanthropic foundation established by a financial 
institution  . Tod ay, Fifth Third’s philanthropy 
is a combination of foundations and Fifth Third Bank corporate giving. In 2020, total 
philanthropy from Fifth Third was $29.8 million.  
The Fifth Third Foundation supports 
communities served by Fifth Third Bank in the 
areas of health and human services, community 
development, arts and culture and education  . 
The Fifth Third Chicagoland Foundation is the 
successor to the MB Charitable Foundation  . 
Fifth Third Bancorp acquired MB Financial Inc  . in 
May 2019  . Th e Chicagoland Foundation serves 
the philanthropic needs of the Chicago area in 
housing and economic development, education, health and human services, and civic and 
community outreach  .   
Combined, the efforts of the Foundation Office at Fifth Third Bank as well as corporate 
donations and local community sponsorships 
enable us to respond to many community needs, 
including food and feeding programs, health 
and wellness, revitalization and stabilization, and 
services to the underserved  .

Community Initiatives
The important work of our Community Development and Social 
Responsibility team often includes major initiatives that enable 
us to hone in on our key priorities  .
Our community initiatives focus on small business 
lending, affordable housing, neighborhood 
stabilization, financial education, economic 
inclusion and workplace development and are 
often subsets of other, larger initiatives that 
enable us to bring together all of our focus areas  .   
OPPORTUNITY ZONES
In early 2020, we announced an investment of 
$100 million in projects that support community 
development through four opportunity zone 
partners: the National Equity Fund, an affiliate 
of Local Initiatives Support Corp  ., kno wn as 
LISC, Raymond James, the Decennial Group and 
Fallbrook Capital  .   
The money is being used to develop projects 
in low-income urban and rural communities 
across the Bank’s footprint  . This investment 
represents one of the largest made by an 
institution with a social impact investment 
strategy in opportunity zones.Designed to spur long-term private sector 
investment into economic development and job 
creation in economically distressed communities, opportunity zones were established as part of the 
2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act to promote investment 
and development in a significant number of 
qualified low-income census tracts  .
Investment projects must satisfy the 
following Fifth Third social impact criteria:
• Be located in a qualified opportunity zone.
• Be eligible for public welfare investment.
• Be developed by an experienced sponsor.
• Be located in a metropolitan statistical area where Fifth Third has determined community need under the Community 
Reinvestment Act  . 
• Be expected to generate a positive economic return.HOPE MANOR VILLAGE IN CHICAGO: 
The Fifth Third CDC invested $11 
million in Hope Manor, the new 
construction of 36 affordable 
housing units for veterans, the 
disabled and homeless. 
Rent for the units will be at or below 
30%, 50% and 60% of the area’s 
median income  . Th e project includes a 
community center, career center and 
computer lab for residents  . Vo lunteers 
of America of Illinois’s True North

The Fifth Third CDC invested $11.3 
million in Harrison Circle under the 
opportunity zone commitment. 
Harrison Circle comprises 80 newly 
constructed housing units—64 of them 
for veterans, the disabled and the 
homeless—and ground-floor commercial 
and retail space in the Rivers Edge 
District of Kalamazoo, Michigan  . It ’s a

Adopting Detroit’s G7 
Neighborhood 
The Gratiot/7 Mile region, known as G7, 
is Fifth Third’s adopted neighborhood 
of Detroit. Fifth Third is investing $5 
million into the community via Detroit’s 
Strategic Neighborhood Fund and 
Affordable Housing Leverage Fund.  
Fifth Third was one of five companies 
to announce such an investment in 
December 2018. On Fifth Third Day—
May 3, 2019—we announced that our 
neighborhood would be G7. The $5 million investment is funding physical 
improvements to parks, streetscapes, 
commercial corridors, single family housing 
and affordable housing  . 
In 2020, Fifth Third provided support to 
non-profit organizations like LifeBUILDERS, 
Forgotten Harvest and Gleaners in the 
emergency phase of the pandemic to ensure 
that our neighbors in G7 were protected 
against food insecurity  . W e also partnered 
with the local Osbourne Business Association 
to work with small business owners to help 
them apply for Paycheck Protection Program 
and grant funding  .  
“I grew up going to my grandfather’s 
pharmacy at Devonshire and Mack Avenue, 
and my current office at Fifth Third faces 
Campus Martius,” said David Girodat, regional 
president of Fifth Third Bank in Eastern Michigan  . “ I’ve experienced not only what 
Detroit was, but what it has become—and I 
know the potential for what it can be  . To be 
supporting this neighborhood rejuvenation 
is inspirational, both personally and 
professionally, and it is certainly 
foundational to Fifth Third’s commitment 
to improving the well-being of the 
communities it serves. ”
Letty Azar, Detroit’s District 4 neighborhood 
manager, said, “When neighborhoods have 
seen corporate projects in the past they 
have been small and not sustainable  . T his is 
different  .” It i s different, Azar said, because 
Fifth Third and G7 have history with the Bank 
providing help during the mortgage crisis  . 
“Fifth Third is not new here  . T hey were here 
with the home mortgage program, and that’s 
what helped stabilize the neighborhood  .” 
David Girodat, regional president of Fifth Third Bank in Eastern Michigan is 
proud of the Bank’s work in G7.

Fifth Third has provided 
$12.6 million in small business 
loans since 2016 under our 
Community Commitment.
ENTREPRENEURSHIP & CDFI FUNDS
In addition to providing $12.6 billion in 
small business loans since 2016 under the 
Community Commitment, we also made a 
promise to provide technical and other vital 
assistance to entrepreneurs, whether they’re 
starting up or growing  . 
Entrepreneurship
We were initial investors in the Entrepreneurs 
of Color funds in Chicago and Detroit  . In 2018, 
we invested $2.5 million in the EOC Fund in 
Chicago.  As of December 2020, over $5 million 
had been disbursed  . Si xty-seven percent of the 
borrowers were Black, 40% were female and 
33% were Hispanic  . 
Among those who received help is Shanetha 
Pollnitz who started a home daycare 19 years 
ago in Chicago  . Th rough strategy, grit and a loan 
through Accion, her business has grown, and she 
now owns Alpha Omega, a center caring for 36 
children  . Po llnitz plans to open another center to 
help ensure that low-income families have access 
to strong child care  .In Detroit, the EOC Fund, in which we invested 
$3 million as it was established, has grown to 
$9.2 million and, as of May 2020, has an average 
loan size of about $88,000  . 
• Our $3 million investment in the Fund helped to spur loans to companies like Power, Lighting & Technical Services LLC. , owned by Angel Paris 
and her husband, Martin Paris, that provides 
electrical design services in Detroit  . • Our investment in the Fund also benefited an iconic men’s clothing store in Michigan, Hot Sam’s Detroit
 . Owned by two legendary 
Detroiters, Tony Stovall and Cliff Green, Hot 
Sam’s has been in business since 1921  . Fu nding 
from the Fund helped Hot Sam’s weather the storm created by the COVID-19 pandemic and will enable them to celebrate 100 years in 
business in 2021  . Forty-six percent of the borrowers from the 
Entrepreneurs of Color Fund in Chicago were 
women-owned businesses.
Fifth Third Executive Vice President Kala Gibson had the privilege of meeting with Shanetha Pollnitz, owner of Alpha Omega in Chicago.

Community Development Financial  
Institutions
Community development financial institutions, 
or CDFIs, are private financial institutions 
dedicated to delivering responsible, affordable 
lending that helps low-income, low-wealth, 
and other disadvantaged people and 
communities join the economic mainstream  . 
By financing community businesses—including 
small businesses, microenterprises, nonprofit 
organizations, commercial real estate and 
affordable housing—CDFIs spark job growth and 
retention in hard-to serve markets across the 
nation  . W e share a common goal with CDFIs and, 
as such, have significantly invested with CDFIs to 
help make an impact  .  
Fifth Third Bank’s Capital to Build Capacity 
program, dubbed C2BC, is a part of our $32 
billion Community Commitment  . W e partnered 
with Community Reinvestment Fund, USA to 
create the C2BC program to improve and 
increase lending opportunities as well as to 
provide operational support  for small business 
owners and small business resource providers  .The program is being powered by our customer 
focus to help small business owners with annual 
revenue of less than $1 million and businesses 
in low- and moderate- income census tracts in 
markets across the bank’s footprint  .
We also have 
worked for 
several years 
with Accion, a global nonprofit dedicated to 
creating a financially inclusive world. We have 
provided nearly $1  .4 mi llion to the organization 
through our foundations to support the lending 
and technical assistance Accion provides to 
underserved small business owners in Illinois, 
Indiana, Florida, Michigan and Ohio  . W e also 
financially support Accion’s in-person outreach 
with small business leaders and its online 
educational resources  .
In 2020, the Fifth Third Foundation made a 
$200,000 grant to the Accion U.S. Network to disburse more than $3.78 million to more than 
250 underserved entrepreneurs, predominantly 
minority, low- and moderate-income, and women 
in Florida, Michigan and Ohio  . H alf of the grant came from the Strengthening Our Communities 
Fund, while the remaining $100,000 was paid 
by the Foundation through the $8  .75 m illion 
designated for COVID-19 relief, recovery and 
resiliency grants  .    
The grants helped Accion to counsel over 1,700 
entrepreneurs through one-on-one technical 
assistance and workshops to provide personal 
financial coaching and mentoring  . F inally, the grant 
reached 1,400 entrepreneurs online with several 
specialized Fifth Third and Accion webinars in

Fifth Third Boosts Black 
Women Entrepreneurs
In an effort to help Black, woman-owned 
businesses during the pandemic, the 
Fifth Third Foundation made $1.2 
million in grants available to them 
through a new Innovation Meets Main 
Street program , a collaboration between 
Local Initiatives Support Corporation, 
known as LISC, and the Association of 
Enterprise Opportunity. 
The foundation grants were part of a 
larger $8.75 million pandemic relief effort.
Stefanie Steward-Young, Fifth Third’s 
chief corporate social responsibility officer, 
said, “ Black-owned business owners 
often face challenges securing capital to 
start and maintain their business—even 
more so during these challenging times. 
This initiative couldn’t be more vital for 
Black communities in metropolitan areas 
like Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Detroit, 
Louisville, Nashville and Orlando  .” 
Through this program, LISC received  
$1 million  from the Fifth Third Foundation  . 
About $630,000 was awarded to 63 small 
businesses, and $250,000 was an investment 
in the Fearless Fund , a venture capital firm 
that invests in businesses led by women 
of color that are seeking financing  . T he 
remaining funds are being used to support 
the delivery of technical assistance  . A s of 
February 2021, more than 60 Black women 
had received funding or technical assistance 
to help their businesses remain open  .
Additionally, AEO received $200,000 from 
the Fifth Third Foundation to provide 
business owners access to MainStreet 
RISE , a suite of critical technology tools and 
resources to keep businesses alive during and 
after the pandemic  . T hrough partnership with 
several industry partnerships, MainStreet 
RISE empowers entrepreneurs with 
capabilities that enable revenue generation,

We are proud to have achieved carbon 
neutrality for our operations* in 2020.
Our success is built upon years of hard 
work, having continued to reduce our own 
environmental footprint through efficiency 
investments and other projects, and by 
our strategy to purchase renewable power , 
which began in 2014  . T he past year marked an 
exciting milestone for Fifth Third’s sustainability 
journey, as we achieved carbon neutrality for our 
operations* for the first time  . T his was achieved 
by reducing our corporate carbon footprint, 
purchasing 100 percent renewable power and 
buying carbon offsets  from a project within 
our Consumer Bank footprint to address our 
remaining emissions  . 
As an organization, we are now carbon neutral 
and removing as much carbon dioxide as we 
emit . T his includes emissions related to all of our 
buildings (including data centers), corporate 
vehicles, and business travel  . I n terms of GHG 
accounting, this includes all Scope 1 emissions, all 
Scope 2 emissions, and Scope 3 business travel 
emissions  . Our carbon neutral achievement 
was the first among our banking peers, which 
demonstrates our continued environmental 
sustainability leadership. The carbon offsets were purchased from the 
Recast Energy biomass project, a thermal energy 
generation conversion project in Louisville, 
Kentucky  . T he project converted a coal-fired 
system to a biomass system using locally 
available forestry and agricultural cellulosic 
residues  . The project achieves GHG emissions 
reductions by displacing over 50,000 tons of 
carbon emissions per year in thermal energy 
generated from the biomass system that 
would have been generated from the old coal-
fired system  . T he project was implemented in 
accordance of the Verified Carbon Standard 
program and was independently verified by NSF 
Certification LLC  . The project was selected by Fifth Third based on 
its location within our retail footprint, conformity 
to an accepted standard, independently verified 
by third-party and its alignment with U  .N . 
Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13  . 
Our carbon neutrality achievement was the result 
of our commitment to lead in environmental 
sustainability  . N ow that we achieved carbon 
neutrality for our operations,* Fifth Third is

SPOTLIGHT
GHG Accounting: Scope 1, 2 and 3 Reporting
There are three categories of GHG emissions:
Scope 1 emissions  are “direct GHG 
emissions” from emissions sources owned or 
controlled by the company, including natural gas 
used for heating, refrigerants, diesel, and fuels 
used in corporate vehicles  . In 2020,  
Fifth Third purchased carbon offsets for 100% 
of these emissions.Scope 2 emissions  are “indirect GHG 
emissions” from purchased or acquired electricity 
and similar sources  . I n 2020, Fifth Third purchased 
RECs for 100% of these emissions  . T here are two 
accounting methods for Scope 2 emissions: 
• The location-based method  uses average 
emissions intensity for the electric power grids 
on which energy consumption occurs  . 
• The market-based method  allows companies 
to account for power they have contracted for, including through the purchase of unbundled renewable energy certificates or through contractual agreements that lead to new renewable power plants and the bundled RECs 
they generate  . 
We report our Scope 2 emissions under both 
methods to illustrate the impact of our renewable 
energy commitment  . In 2020, Fifth Third had 
a 46% reduction in Scope 2 location-based 
emissions and a 100% reduction in Scope 2 
market-based emissions (compared to our 
2014 baseline)  . F ifth Third is also reporting our 
GHG reduction KPI which is one of our bold 
sustainability goals  . T his KPI uses the location-
based method but is limited to properties for 
which Fifth Third receives a utility bill  . I n 2020, our 
GHG KPI had a 41% reduction compared to 2014  .Scope 3 emissions  include 15 categories 
of other indirect GHG emissions, such as 
business travel, capital goods and investments  . 
Since 2019, Fifth Third has reported on Scope 
3 emissions for business travel  . In 2020, Fifth 
Third purchased carbon offsets for 100% of 
business travel emissions.  We continue to 
evaluate methodologies to quantify other Scope 3 emissions, including for Category 15 (Investments), 
which are relevant for financial institutions  . 
In April 2021, Fifth Third joined the Partnership 
for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), an 
industry-led partnership of over 110 financial institutions worldwide that work together 
to develop and implement a consistent and transparent standard for financial institutions to assess and disclose client GHG emissions 
associated with loans and investments  .
“We understand that our 
impact to the environment isn’t just what we do with 
Fifth Third’s operations, but 
also includes the impact of 
our customers’ operations 
that we finance,” said Jamie Leonard, executive 
vice president and chief financial officer  . “PCAF is pleased that Fifth 
Third Bank has joined over 110 
financial institutions globally 
that are committed to measuring 
and disclosing the emissions 
of their portfolios to support 
meeting the goals of the Paris 
Climate Agreement. Fifth Third’s 
drive to keep measuring and 
reducing its emissions across all 
scopes will make it a valuable 
collaborator in PCAF.”

In 2017, Fifth Third set five bold sustainability 
goals to help prioritize our environmental 
sustainability efforts.  This included targeted 
goals to reduce our energy use and location 
based GHG emissions by 25%, to reduce our 
water consumption and waste sent to a landfill 
by 20%, and to purchase 100% renewable power  . 
Three of these goals (water, GHG emissions, and 
renewable power) have now been achieved, and 
we are close to achieving our remaining goals 
(energy and landfill waste reduction)  .

We invested in LED lighting, HVAC upgrades 
and building controls  . We made improvements 
in space utilization and in the sustainability of our 
new construction, renovation and facility-related 
operations and maintenance practices  .
Last year, we completed our phase one rollout of 
advanced building management controls to more than 230 locations across our portfolio  . Th ese 
new system controls help monitor and manage 
energy usage from our largest source (building 
heating and cooling)  . We w ill continue to assess 
this technology across our portfolio to better 
manage energy needs for our buildings  .
To gain more granular insight on the energy usage 
across our footprint, we began benchmarking 
locations through the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency’s Portfolio Manager tool. In 
doing so, we identified a number of locations that 
qualified for ENERGY STAR® certification and had 
our first 50 locations Energy Star certified by a 
third party  . 50 Fifth Third 
locations are 
Energy Star 
certified
“EPA applauds Fifth Third Bank for its

SPOTLIGHT
Bank Installs EV Charging 
Stations
Fifth Third recently installed electric 
vehicle charging stations at our 
headquarters in Cincinnati  . We r ecognize 
the environmental benefits of electric transportation and the growth of the  
EV market  .
Upon the opening of the EV stations, 
employees can charge their vehicles 
while they work at no incremental cost  . 
Through the purchase of 100% renewable 
electricity for our operations, employees can now charge their vehicles in an 
environmentally responsible manner  .      
Moving forward, the Bank will continue 
to assess EV charging as an amenity for 
our employees and as an opportunity to expand the reach of our sustainability 
leadership  .

100% RENEWABLE POWER
This past year marked the first calendar year for 
Fifth Third purchasing 100% renewable power. 
This milestone began with the opening of the 
80 MWac/120 MWdc Aulander Holloman solar 
facility in 2019, which was facilitated through a 
virtual power purchase agreement (PPA) signed 
by the Bank  . Wi th this project, Fifth Third became 
the first bank and first Fortune 500 company to 
purchase 100% renewable power through a single, 
solar project  . In 2020, the solar generation 
from the project was more than 180,000 
MWh , enough to power over 21,000 homes 
or equivalent to reducing emissions from over 
27,000 passenger vehicles  .* 
The signing of the PPA in March 2018 facilitated 
the construction of this solar field by 
guaranteeing that Fifth Third would purchase 
all of the electricity generated at a stated price , 
thereby enabling SunEnergy1 to secure funding 
and begin construction  . In r eturn for guaranteeing 
to purchase the energy produced, Fifth Third 
receives all the environmental attributes , or 
renewable energy certificates, generated from 
the project  . In 2 019, Fifth Third retired all of the 
RECs from the Aulander Holloman project in 
addition to RECs from other sources to achieve 
97 .4% of renewable energy for the year  . Alt hough 
we intended to retire the RECs received from 
this project towards our 100% renewable goal, in 
2020 we completed a REC swap to offset some 
of the costs of the PPA due to the drop in energy 
prices  . The purchased RECs are sourced from other renewable energy projects in the U  .S . an d 
have been Green-E certified  . To day, 100% of Fifth 
Third’s power is from renewable sources  .“We welcome Fifth 
Third’s leadership 
in environmental 
sustainability by 
purchasing 100% of 
renewable energy and 
adding clean power to 
America’s energy grid. 
They are demonstrating 
that renewables make 
business sense—more 
companies must do 
the same so we can 
accelerate a cleaner 
future for all of us.”

MANAGING WASTE 
Fifth Third committed to reducing the amount 
of waste it sends to landfills by 20% by 2022  . In 
just two years since the Bank began recording 
its annual waste totals in 2018, we have reduced 
landfill waste by 14%  .
The Bank’s waste activities typically involve 
standard office waste, with some waste being 
produced in building construction/renovation, 
disposal of electronic equipment, and from 
retail tenants where waste service is often 
combined  . As a fi nancial institution, Fifth Third 
uses paper through general office activities 
and in documenting and processing customer 
lending/finance activities  . Our focus on secure 
destruction and recycling of this paper remains 
a priority and included the recycling of more 
than 8 million pounds of paper in 2020. Fifth 
Third has also continued to support digitization in 
office and customer-facing applications to reduce 
the need and use of paper  .
With respect to construction and demolition 
activity, Fifth Third has established diversion 
requirements for partners to ensure material is 
being managed responsibly  . In 2 020, more than 
five million pounds were diverted from landfills 
for reuse, which included a diversion rate of 
more than 80%  .
At our Madisonville campus in Cincinnati, we have 
instituted food waste composting as an additional 
waste mitigation strategy, resulting in more than 
50,000 pounds of organic waste diverted  . WATER AS A RESOURCE
Fifth Third committed to reducing its water 
consumption 20% by 2022  . Th is commitment 
was made with the understanding that water is a 
limited resource and requires significant energy 
(and in most cases, emissions) to manage  . To 
date, Fifth Third has reduced its total water 
consumption 31% compared to 2014.
As a financial institution that operates office 
space, water usage (withdraw) typically involves 
the use of municipal water for sinks/bathrooms, 
office cleaning, landscape irrigation and some 
minimal mechanical uses  . In a s mall number of 
cases, Fifth Third uses local on-site water wells as 
a water source  . Wat er is discharged to municipal 
sewer systems or to the ground in the case of 
retail landscaping activity  . Gi ven its water usage 
and discharge activities, Fifth Third has not seen 
a need to establish independent standards for 
effluents  . Re porting information on water usage 
is based on utility bills  . Th e Bank has yet to assess 
upstream and downstream water impacts but will 
consider doing so in the future  .
Much of Fifth Third’s water consumption is 
driven by on-site irrigation that helps maintain 
landscapes at our retail locations  . Wh ile we 
maintain a high standard for exterior spaces, 
we also aim to have responsible use of water 
resources  . Wi th this goal, a  smart irrigation 
program was launched in 2018 to help manage 
and control exterior water use , giving the Bank 
remote visibility into irrigation schedules and 
controller functionality  . Th e system also monitors real-time weather  . Wh en a rain event is set to 
overlap with an existing irrigation event, the 
system makes a real time correction, reducing the 
water used  . Th ese smart controls not only limit 
our overall water use but protect our sites and 
infrastructure from the hazards of over-watering  .
Fifth Third has also adopted water efficiency 
standards for new equipment to ensure we are 
responsibly managing water use  .
For over 10 years, Fifth Third 
has reported our environmental 
impacts through the climate 
change disclosure system run 
by CDP (formerly the Carbon 
Disclosure Project)  . In both  
2019 and 2020, Fifth Third 
received an “A-”  which is in the  
leadership band demonstrating 
we are implementing current  
best practices  .

GREEN PROCUREMENT
In addition to pursuing our bold goals, Fifth Third looks for opportunities to drive sustainability into all aspects of our business  . 
GREEN CLEANING
In 2018, we implemented a new 
environmentally friendly cleaning 
standard in our building operations  to help 
reduce the exposure of building occupants 
and maintenance personnel to chemical, 
biological and particulate contaminants 
that may adversely affect air quality, human 
health and the environment  . Th e standard 
seeks both to protect local communities 
and to protect customers, employees and 
teams performing the cleaning  .
Fifth Third follows the U.S. Green 
Building Council’s Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design (LEED) green 
cleaning recommendations  to ensure that 
the majority of cleaning products meet 
national standards, including EPA Safer 
Choice, Eco Logo and Green Seal  . Th ese 
efforts also impact cleaning equipment, 
which is being changed to meet best 
practices on noise reduction, energy and 
water efficiency, and emissions  . Th ese 
standards contribute to corporate energy 
and water reduction goals  .ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE 
PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS
Continually increasing our use of 
environmentally sustainable products 
helps ensure we have a smaller 
environmental impact  from the 
development and manufacturing of these 
products  . It a lso improves occupant 
health and operational efficiencies 
associated with our buildings  . Gr eener 
product selections are incorporated into 
design standards for fabrics, furnishings 
and flooring  . Building and renovation 
standards also establish energy and 
water efficiency requirements for 
building products, including wall 
insulation, windows, lighting, plumbing 
fixtures and mechanical equipment.  
These products must meet enhanced 
standards such as the U  .S . EP A’s Energy 
Star® and WaterSense standards, specific 
efficiency ratings (SEER ratings) or other 
minimum criteria  .REDUCING EMBODIED CARBON  
IN CARPETING
We recently began evaluating the 
embodied carbon of specific products  . 
Embodied carbon represents all the 
impacts related to the sourcing of raw 
materials, product manufacturing and 
transportation  . Ou r collaboration with 
Interface, a company that offers a suite 
of carbon-neutral flooring products, has 
been a key success of our efforts  . In 2020, 
we purchased more than 13,000 square 
yards of Interface carbon neutral flooring. 
The majority of these products are made 
from 100% recycled nylon, which makes 
use of a discarded material and avoids the 
need for virgin materials  . Acco rding to 
Interface, the combined impact of these 
purchases includes reducing 121 metric 
tons of carbon dioxide from entering 
the atmosphere  . We co ntinue to assess 
opportunities to reduce the embodied 
carbon of the products we choose so 
that our operations and buildings are as 
sustainable as possible  .

Fifth Third’s comprehensive processes for 
managing risks, including climate-related risks, are described in the Enterprise Risk Management section on page 37
 of this report  . Oversight for 
climate-related risks includes both Board-level and senior management oversight.
View Fifth Third’s 
comprehensive processes 
for managing risks in the 
Enterprise Risk Management  
section of this report.Board-Level Oversight
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the corporate governance, strategy, and risks of Fifth Third, which include risks and opportunities relating to 
climate  . In fulfilling its responsibilities, the 
Board has delegated responsibilities to the following Board-level committees:
• The Risk and Compliance  
Committee  has been delegated the 
responsibilities to monitor and oversee risks, 
including climate risk, from the Board  . Th e 
RCC’s purpose is to oversee development and implementation of Fifth Third’s Risk Management Framework, inclusive of risk appetite; review, approve, and oversee the development of effective policies, processes and programs to ensure risks are properly managed and controlled; and annually 
review risk management policies  . 
• The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  has been 
delegated responsibilities to monitor and oversee governance matters from the 
Board  . The NCG Committee is responsible 
for developing and recommending corporate governance policies and guidelines, recommending policies to enhance Board effectiveness, creating and reviewing corporate governance policies, reviewing and advising on the governance structure, and overseeing ESG-related commitments, issues and strategy 
(including climate strategy)  . Cl imate-related issues are addressed in this committee in the context of stakeholder concerns, including those articulated by institutional investors, employees, customers, and community 
advocacy groups  .
The Board is supported by the chief executive officer who is also the Board chair,  and well positioned to help the Board 
understand how climate change is integrated into the Bank’s strategy and risk management, and to help the Board fulfill its oversight 
responsibilities related to climate change  . 
Senior Management Oversight 
Our enterprise risk management framework includes a hierarchy of risk management committees to review and manage all 
major risk types that affect the Company  . 
Risk-related issues are communicated to risk management committees that are dedicated to specific risk types based on materiality and the most significant risks are communicated up to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and  RCC . The 
Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee  is one of these risk management 
committees in our governance framework, and reputational and other corporate risks relating to climate matters are reviewed and 
managed in this committee  . 
The CRRC is supported by the ESG Committee which provides guidance and feedback with respect to the assessment of 
environmental risks facing Fifth Third  .

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND 
MANAGEMENT 
In 2017, we began to look more closely at how to 
mature Fifth Third’s integration of climate-related 
risks—including physical risks  and transition 
risks —into our risk management framework  .  
Fifth Third’s climate risk working group is led 
by the Enterprise Risk Team and comprised of 
experts from each of the applicable risk types as 
well as leadership from lines of business, investor 
relations, and legal  . The g roup meets regularly to 
identify climate risks and analyze the potential 
impact of various climate scenarios on the Bank  .  
Physical Risks
Physical risks from a changing climate are already 
present and growing  . These risks can be acute 
(event-driven) or chronic longer-term shifts 
in the environment.  Examples of physical risks 
include, but are not limited to, extreme weather 
events such as hurricanes, floods, winter storms, 
heat waves and droughts, as well as chronic sea-
level rise or deforestation  . Physical risks may transmit into financial 
risks in the following ways:
• Operational risk:  Fifth Third may be 
directly subject to operational risk by operating facilities, including over 1,100 full-service banking centers, across the 
midwest and southeast markets  . The se 
facilities may be vulnerable to acute weather events, such as hurricanes, floods and tornadoes, which could 
cause business disruptions  . 
• Credit risk:  Fifth Third may be indirectly 
exposed to credit risk due to the potential impact of acute or chronic weather events which may weigh on our clients’ financial health and their ability 
to meet their financial obligations  . 
An example of this is flood risk, which may 
impact our residential mortgage portfolio  . Mos t 
mortgages originated and serviced by Fifth Third 
are guaranteed by either Fannie Mae or Ginnie 
Mae, however, Fifth Third does retain a smaller 
portfolio of mortgages that may be subject to 
flood risk  . Alth ough mortgages located in a flood 
zone designated by FEMA are required to have 
flood insurance, there are known limitations with 
the models used by FEMA in assessing flood risks, 
such as a focus on coastal and fluvial (river) risk 
and not flooding due to pluvial (rainfall) risk  .
Therefore, Fifth Third’s Decision Science Group 
undertook a project to better understand our exposure to flood risk, concentrating first on 
North Carolina mortgage exposures  . The t eam 
partnered with First Street Foundation, a leading, non-profit research and technology company, 
who models the risks of flooding including pluvial, storm surge and tidal flooding, both now and in 
the future  . Unl ike the FEMA models that are not 
asset specific, the models used in the analysis 
considers factors such as the building footprint elevation, home value, height of the first finished 
floor, building materials and more  .  
Map represents the difference between FEMA and First Street’s risk assessment in 
North Carolina
The project resulted in identifying new properties 
that may be subject to flood risk that are not 
located in designated FEMA flood zones  . The 
results were shared with the Mortgage line of 
business as well as the credit risk teams  . Fif th 
Third is considering expanding the analysis 
beyond the original project scope in the future  .Fifth Third’s climate risk 
working group identifies 
climate risks and analyzes the 
potential impact of various 
climate scenarios.

Transition Risks
Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy may 
present additional risks, including credit, strategic 
and reputational risks  . Exa mples of transition 
risks facing Fifth Third and our clients include 
but are not limited to energy transition policies, 
disruptive technological advancements 
including clean energy development and 
storage, shifts in consumer preferences or other 
disruptions to legacy business models.  
Transition risks arise from human efforts to 
address environmental risks from climate 
change and may be transmitted into 
financial risks such as:
• Credit risk:  Fifth Third may be indirectly 
exposed to credit risk due to the 
potential impact of transition risks on our clients’ financial health and their 
ability to service debt  .  
• Strategic risk: Fifth Third may face strategic risks from the potential industry transition to a low carbon economy as it relates to our lending 
and business strategies  .  
• Reputational risk: Fifth Third may be subject to reputational risk directly if key stakeholders do not agree with our meaningful public commitments on climate change or if we are not demonstrating substantial progress 
towards our commitments  .ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS IN 
COMMERCIAL DECISIONS
Recognizing 
the heightened 
environmental risks 
inherent in the energy 
sector, we implemented 
an environmental risk assessment component 
for new lending 
opportunities in 2013  . In 
addition to environmental 
risks such as the client’s management of water 
and air emissions, we also evaluate social risks such 
as worker safety and community engagement  . In 
2020, we published a new Environmental and 
Social Policy that identifies sectors that pose 
heightened environmental and social risks.  The 
policy provides guidance on clients in sectors and 
activities that are prohibited or that are subject to 
enhanced customer due diligence and may require 
escalated review and approval from senior leaders  . 
All commercial loans secured by commercial 
real estate are subject to environmental due 
diligence  . In accordance with our commercial 
loan policy, each collateral property is assessed 
for actual or potential environmental liabilities from the transaction.  Our Environmental 
Risk Group is responsible for working with our 
commercial lending partners to manage or 
mitigate any identified environmental risks  . The 
Bank’s Environmental Risk Group is staffed with 
experienced environmental professionals to 
support commercial lending teams in managing environmental risks  and enabling prudent 
financing of environmentally impaired properties  .
Managing environmental risks not only enables 
the Bank to avoid losses due to environmental 
liabilities, but also allows the Bank to finance the 
remediation and redevelopment of properties 
where the redevelopment or reuse is complicated 
by actual or potential presence of contamination 
(i .e ., brownfields)  . Living our Core Values
In times like these, it is just as important to 
note what Fifth Third DOES NOT DO :
• Knowingly engage with businesses directly involved in bribery, child labor, illegal logging, and other prohibited activities  listed in our Environmental and 
Social Policy  . 
• Business with debt collectors, high interest rate lenders, or manufacturers and distributors of military-style firearms for nonlaw enforcement, non-military use without performing enhanced due diligence to ensure they are not in conflict with our 
Core Values and Code of Conduct  .
• Business with clients in sectors with elevated environmental and social risks without enhanced due diligence, including forestry, palm oil, coal mining, nuclear 
power, and Arctic drilling  .

In 2020, we set our first sustainable finance 
goal of $8 billion to be achieved by 2025. 
This goal includes lending and financing for 
renewable energy, which we define as solar,

We decided to limit the scope of our public 
commitment to include only lending and 
facilitation of capital raising because these 
services contribute most directly to attracting 
new investments in renewable power  . 
Fifth Third has provided $5.4 billion in lending 
and capital raising services since 2012. These 
services have helped lead to the completion 
of more than 3.5 GW of renewable energy 
projects across 50+ clients.  In addition, we have

OTHER SUSTAINABLE FINANCING 
INITIATIVES
Fifth Third helps clients in our leasing business 
reduce their own environmental impact by 
converting internal combustion (e.g. propane or 
diesel) forklifts to electric.  As of December 31, 
2020, Fifth Third leases over 1,500 electric assets 
to more than 18 clients across 38 states  . Fo r 
every 10,000 hours of use, internal combustion-
powered forklifts emit 120,000 more pounds of 
carbon emissions than electric forklifts**  . El ectric 
forklifts with their zero local emissions ensure 
cleaner, more healthful air, indoors and out  . Th is 
is not only good for the environment, it’s good for 
employee health  .“Fifth Third Bank continues 
to inspire change by seeking 
opportunities to help business 
leaders build a cleaner, more 
sustainable economy.” 
-SUSAN MUNROE , DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT WITH THE CHAMBERS FOR 
INNOVATION AND CLEAN ENERGY
Fifth Third has participated in credit facilities 
with the concept of “green” or “sustainable” 
pricing,  whereby the borrower is able to achieve 
reduced pricing by meeting certain sustainability 
metrics  . These metrics can be a certain 
percentage of “green” assets in a portfolio for a real estate customer or GHG emission reductions 
for other corporate banking clients  . Fi fth Third 
believes incentivizing customers to achieve 
agreed upon sustainability or other ESG metrics 
will help support them through the transition to a 
low-carbon economy  .
Fifth Third is also helping clients by 
underwriting sustainability bonds,  where the 
proceeds are applied to finance either “green” or 
“social” projects  . As o f March 31, 2021, Fifth Third 
has underwritten six sustainability bonds (4 green, 
2 sustainable) for over $4 billion for clients in the 
utilities, real estate and telecom sectors  .

Bank’s Solar Lending 
Enables Beneficial Environmental 
Stewardship
Fifth Third’s solar lending business is 
more than just the financing of renewable 
energy projects; it also enables us to 
support the transition to a sustainable 
future and to encourage responsible 
stewardship of the land. In 2020, the 
Bank served as administrative agent 
and left lead arranger for the Trillium 
portfolio of solar assets sponsored 
by Greenbacker Renewable Energy 
Company. Fifth Third financed $105 
million for 45 projects through the facility.
The Trillium portfolio’s 
solar assets produce 
reliable clean energy 
and engage the land 
beneath the solar panels 
to support native flora 
and fauna by introducing 
pollinator-friendly 
vegetation  . S ix of the portfolio’s projects—totaling 
8 MWdc of generating capacity across Arkansas, 
Vermont, and Washington, DC—are contracted to 
transition from turf grass under their solar arrays 
to a variety of perennial plantings  .Greenbacker has partnered with solar 
developer Encore Renewable Energy and 
pollinator-habitat installation organization 
Bee the Change on four of the six projects  . 
Once completed, the roughly 35 acres of 
native grasses and flowering plants will 
provide habitats that support diverse and 
healthy pollinator populations, and increase 
the overall health and biodiversity of the area  . 
The vegetation will also have environmental 
benefits both below the surface of the 
ground and beyond the fence line of the 
facilities  . The plantings reduce stormwater 
runoff, decrease frost heave potential, 
improve water quality and soil health, and 
sequester carbon through the biomass of 
deep-rooted perennial vegetation  .  
Two of the Trillium sites set to provide this 
valuable habitat have already completed 
construction and begun the critical phase of 
site preparation  . O nce established, the newly 
introduced greenery can offer additional 
operational advantages for the solar project’s 
owner, as well  . These plants lower site 
maintenance costs—more than offsetting 
upfront planting expenses—as they require 
far less upkeep than turf grass. Preliminary data suggests new flora also generates a cooler 
microclimate beneath the solar equipment, 
which can help improve solar panel efficiency  . 
Greenbacker is excited for the many potential 
biological, geological, and operational benefits that pollinator-friendly vegetation 
will add to the Trillium projects  . T hrough 
its collaborative relationships, the company 
will also ensure that pollinator habitat is successfully established and maintained on 
its sites, in service of its mission to provide 
thoughtful, communal, and symbiotic 
stewardship of the land
 . 
“When we can be thoughtful about our landscape design in 
order to improve our local ecology and community, while also 
driving down our overall costs, we consider this a win-win.”

urban revitalization strategist and consultant  . 
Fifth Third also is a founding member of the 
Greater Cincinnati Green Business Council 
and the Cincinnati 2030 District  .
We also support our employees and 
community in their own sustainability journeys  . 
In 2020, we hosted employee-focused 
electronic waste take-back events at our 
Madisonville and Grand Rapids campuses which collected more than 17,269 pounds of 
obsolete electronics  . Th ese events kept these 
materials out of the landfill and ensured they 
were recycled  . In J une 2020, we hosted a city-
wide compost bin sale to help citizens purchase 
the supplies needed to compost at home  .
Fifth Third was proud to be the primary 
sponsor of Chicago’s “Bike the Drive” in both 
2019 and 2020  . Th is event encourages the 
community to use active transportation modes 
and serves as a fundraiser for the Active 
Transportation Alliance which works to advance 
these transportation modes year-round  .
Our sustainability accomplishments were made 
possible through innovation and collaboration 
across many teams at Fifth Third—it’s now our 
responsibility to share our experience  . Fifth Third held a compost bin event on its Madisonville Operations Center campus in Cincinnati.
