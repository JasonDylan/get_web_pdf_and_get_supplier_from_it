Integrated Report 2021 2 IndexIn this integrated report, LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. presents the year’s 
information, progress, and challenges 
from January 1 to December 31, 
2021. The publication is based on 
the principles of integrated reporting 
from the International Integrated 
Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines to 
connect financial and non-financial 
information in the different economic, 
environmental, and social dimensions of 
LATAM's business and its relationships 
with stakeholders.
The group's financial statements are an 
integral part of the Report.
Currency and exchange conventions
LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and most of 
its affiliates maintain their accounting 
records and prepare their financial 
statements in US dollars (USD); some 
use Chilean pesos, Colombian pesos, 
or Brazilian reals. The group's audited 
consolidated financial statements 
include the results of these affiliates 
translated into US dollars.
In accordance with the International 
Accounting Standards (IASB), assets 
and liabilities consider the exchange 
rate at the end of the period. The 
income and expense accounts take into 
account the exchange rate at the date of the transaction; however, a monthly 
exchange rate may be adopted if the 
rates do not vary widely.

LATAM
Integrated Report 2021
Highlights 6Personally, it was a very dynamic year, 
in which I began to act as promoter of 
the Organizational Health Index (OHI), 
and it was also very challenging with 
the homogenization of the Boeing 787 
aircraft. I think it was a much better year 
than 2020, but still full of challenges 
because there are still health barriers 
preventing the normal return of the 
international network.
I was on maternity leave and I went 
back to work in midyear, which was 
a time of great mobilization and 
uncertainty. I feel that I left in 2020 
from a very oscillating LATAM, at the 
height of change and restructuring, and 
that I returned in 2021 to a completely 
changed LATAM: more dynamic, more 
flexible, and in the process of being 
overhauled and organized from scratch.2021 was a year of many challenges. 
New COVID-19 variants and border 
closures have greatly impacted the 
business. But it was also a year when 
we resumed some of the operations, in 
which we were able to again operate 
important routes and recover the 
"closeness" with clients.
I am very proud to work in a group of 
companies that are concerned about In 2021, we saw projects such as “One 
Device per Crewmember,” which allows 
us to simplify and greatly streamline our 
cabin activities and thus improve the level 
of passenger satisfaction. There was also 
a program of frequent meetings with the 
most diverse levels of internal leadership 
which, in my opinion, raised the level of 
transparency within the company, making 
communication more direct and effective.
From my position, I feel that there 
were many changes throughout 2021 
and that, as a team, we faced many 
new challenges and situations that 
led us to shift and change the way we 
work. Today, I can say that we grew a 
lot as a team, we changed and changed 
for the better. We got stronger and 
became more united.  MAZZONI COELHO,
 Cabin crew, Brazil
 ANTONELA PIPERNO,
People Analyst, Argentina EDUARDO PATTA,
 Head of Sales in Asia, Englandsuch important and essential issues as 
diversity, inclusion, and the impact of 
their business on the environment. I 
believe that this fairer, more empathic, 
transparent, and sustainable culture 
that we are trying to implement daily 
and in dealing with clients has been very 
welcome. There is still a long way to go, 
but we are on the right track.
Integrated Report 2021
Highlights 72021 was for us a year of great growth; 
we had not seen so much movement in 
many years. New routes were opened, 
frequencies increased, and it is exciting 
for us to see more LATAM aircraft flying 
in Colombia. There was also much 
motivation due to the promotion of first 
officers to captain and the incorporation 
of new first officers into the group.
2021 was a difficult year in which 
we began implementing CROAMIS, 
the end-to-end world-class system 
of LATAM Cargo. This is the most 
important technological transformation 
in the history of LATAM Cargo and 
having brought this project forward 
in the midst of the pandemic, and 
remotely, is not easy at all, but having 
been able to participate in it brings me 
enormous satisfaction.2021 was a year full of changes. The 
operation began to grow despite being 
within a pandemic context, which made it 
a more challenging year. In this desire to 
fly again, we have seen very important 
progress, all thanks to the fact that 
the company has worked to improve 
operational processes, both for the 
internal and external client, which have 
been developed in a more agile way.It is very important for us as command crew 
to be part of a team committed to tolerance 
for diversity and inclusion not only of its 
employees, but also of passengers. We see the 
effort on the part of the administration to turn 
this practice into a culture, and we see how we 
have moved toward to become a group that 
is more connected with the needs of society 
regarding the care of the environment.
It was also a year in which we made 
great progress regarding the company 
that we want to be, and it is not easy 
to do this during a pandemic. It is 
becoming increasingly apparent that 
we are coming to where we want to be 
as LATAM and as individuals, and how 
we want to relate to our customers. I 
think we are on the right track. MARÍA CAMILA DUQUE,

work in a company that declares them 
important in its daily work. That fills me 
with pride.
Integrated Report 2021
Highlights 8As an aeronautical technician in the 
Maintenance Area, I can say that 2021 
was a year of resurgence where, to achieve 
our goals again, we had to rethink changes 
in both the workplace and at home, and 
thus return to being among the best 
airlines in the world. The Maintenance 
Area was enthusiastic about the project 
to be a fair, empathic, transparent, and 
sustainable group, and this is something 
we value very much, because it means 
2021 was a very complex year for all of us, 
bar none. Uncertainty was present every 
day and so were moments of opportunity, 
change, and new challenges where selling 
became more difficult every day: not 
only did we have to go out and look for 
that opportunity, but there was also a 
double effort to charm and re-charm our 
passengers and to make them regain the 
confidence in us to fly safe and in peace.2021 was for all of us like learning to 
walk, or rather fly, again. At LATAM, we 
have started a new way of flying that we 
can see on a daily basis, being more just 
with the internal and external clients, 
being empathic with my colleague beside 
me, being transparent in the decisions we 
make, and simplifying the processes and 
procedures we roll out.
This new way of flying LATAM also 
includes a focus on taking more care of that the company we are part of is one that 
thinks not only about itself, but also about the 
environment around us.
With regard to the commitment to diversity 
and inclusion, which LATAM announced in 
2021, we are very pleased to know that 
LATAM declares itself to be an open-minded 
company and is always open to change and no 
discrimination will be found or accepted in it.
Opportunities are born from adversity, 
and LATAM was able to take advantage 
of them by implementing, at the right 
time, new platforms of simpler and 
more efficient systems that are with us 
to become better for the future, for our 
passengers and, why not, for ourselves.ASTRICK ELERA,

Cabin crew leader, Paraguayour environment and we can see that in 
our commitment to sustainability. But 
that is where each of us can contribute 
something because this commitment is 
based on great actions, such as reducing 
the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft, 
and even small details from each of us, 
such as recycling a bottle cap. All efforts 
add up. At the end of the day, we are all 
LATAM.
Integrated Report 2021
Highlights 9Letter from  
the CEO
102-14
LATAM group CEO with captain Erich Oppliger, from the A320 fleet.We have reached the end of 
2021, living through our 
second year of the pandemic. 
The uncertainty that started in March 
2020 has spread far more than we all 
expected. The recovery in demand for 
air travel has been slow and erratic. The 
arrival of the delta variant first, and 
omicron toward the end of the year, 
together with the constant changes 
to flight restrictions and entry into 
countries, forced us to remain extremely 
agile and attentive and to take 
measures to adjust.
The aggregate impact of the pandemic 
on operations and clients has been 
dramatic. In these 21 months, we have 
tried to handle each of the individual 
situations with attention and care. All of 
this, moreover, is happening in parallel 
with the continuation of the financial 
reorganization process under Chapter 
11, initiated in May 2020.
Nevertheless, the group managed to 
make progress on a gradual recovery of 
its operations thanks to its versatility 
and adaptability and interest in 
restoring its network and profitability 
in the shortest time possible. LATAM 
increased its operations (measured 
in ASK – available seat-kilometer), 
compared to the corresponding month 
of 2019) from 38.9% in January 2021 to 70.1% in December of that year. This 
recovery was sharper in the domestic 
markets of its subsidiaries, especially 
Brazil and Colombia, as well as 
cargo subsidiaries.
For the first time since the pandemic 
began, we had good financial news. The 
fourth quarter’s operating results were 
positive and came within the framework 
of major restructuring initiatives in 
fleet, employees, digitization, and 
process simplification, which totaled 
over US$900 million in cost savings. 
Despite the above, the group’s financial 
results are still very affected compared 
to 2019. Total revenues reached 
US$5.11 billion, a decrease of 51.0% 
from pre-pandemic levels.
In this difficult scenario, the LATAM 
group continued to develop and 
implement projects to enhance 
customer experience. In 2021, we 
continued with the digital transformation 
and looked for new opportunities that 
bring agility, facilitate access, and 
provide more satisfaction to those who 
prefer our services. In addition to the 
above, we continued to transform our 
passengers’ flight experience through 
cabin retrofits, reaching a total of 
115 aircraft with renewed interiors. 
Furthermore, the subsidiary in Brazil 
continued to equip its aircraft with Wi-Fi connectivity, totaling 50 aircraft with 
this service by the end of the year.
Beyond our progress, we are aware 
that the experience we deliver to our 
passengers is not always what we want, 
sometimes as a result of the difficulties 
created by the pandemic, and others, 
simply because of us. We know there 
is a gap, and we are working to fill that 
space with effective solutions.
As for our fleet modernization plan, 
we have concluded an agreement with 
Airbus for the purchase of 28 new 
aircraft in addition to the 42 narrow-
body aircraft already agreed for the 
next few years. In total, 70 aircraft 
of the A320neo family with lower 
CO2 emissions, a 50% reduction in 
nitrogen oxide emissions, and a 50% 
reduction in the acoustic footprint. 
On the other hand, the LATAM group 
announced the expansion of the cargo 
fleet with 10 Boeing 767-300 Boeing 
Converted Freighters to total 21 
freighters by 2023.
With a long-term view, we lay the 
foundations for the future of the 
business through the launch of our new 
Sustainability Strategy with a focus 
on climate change, circular economy, 
and shared value. We set challenging 
but well-defined goals for ourselves: 
Integrated Report 2021
Integrated Report 2021 Letter from the CEO 10eliminating single-use plastics in 
all operations (2023); zero waste to 
landfill (2027); achieving carbon-neutral 
growth with 2019 as the baseline, and 
offsetting 50% of domestic emissions 
(2030), all as part of the path to carbon 
neutrality by 2050.
We are committed to reducing 
emissions and managing our carbon 
footprint through programs such as 
LATAM Fuel Efficiency which, over 10 
years, has enabled us to have a 5.3% 
fuel efficiency increase. As a result of 
this program, in 2021, we reduced fuel 
consumption by 8.3 million gallons, 
thereby avoiding the emission of 79,533 
tons of greenhouse gases. 
In addition, we are focused on 
contributing to the preservation of the 
biodiversity of South America, and 
thus, in 2021, we initiated an alliance 
with Fundación Cataruben and Project 
CO2Bio for the conservation and 
restoration of a strategic ecosystem 
of the region: 200 thousand hectares 
of floodable savanna in Colombia’s 
Orinoco region. 
As a result of the partnership with 
CO2Bio and the support for projects in 
other iconic ecosystems in the region, 
in 2021, LATAM offset 335,183 tons 
of CO2, while in 2022, the group is planning to reach 723 thousand tons. 
At the same time, under a collaborative 
approach, we are promoting the “Fly 
Neutral” program, which offers our 
corporate and cargo clients the option 
of offsetting CO 2 emissions associated 
with their travel and supporting the 
conservation of iconic South American 
ecosystems. As part of the value 
proposition and core of the program, 
we match the amount of tons our 
clients offset to double the impact.
Last year, and following the S&P 
Corporate Sustainability Assessment, 
LATAM Airlines Group S.A. was 
recognized as the most sustainable 
airline in the region and the fourth in 
the world, as well as being included 
in the Sustainability Yearbook 2022 
in the Bronze category, maintaining 
its position as one of the best-
performing companies in sustainability 
in the industry.
Yet, not only do we want to be a player 
that promotes the environmental and 
economic development of the region, 
but we also want to be increasingly 
connected with the needs of the 
communities where we operate. For 
that reason, we have continued with 
our Avion Solidario  program which, 
particularly in the face of the pandemic, 
has provided free support to health, environmental, and natural disaster 
needs within the region.
The LATAM group has joined in the 
effort that society as a whole has made 
to deal with the pandemic. Thus, at 
the end of 2021 and for free, almost 
208 million vaccines were distributed 
in Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru, 
in addition to health professionals 
mobilized, among others, allowing us to 
support the region from what we know 
how to do: connect and transport.
In 2021, we made very significant 
progress in our Chapter 11 process. 
As announced on September 9 
in the Five-Year Business Plan, 
LATAM expects to achieve a 
complete recovery in domestic and 
international demand in 2022 and 
2024, respectively. In addition, 2024 
financial results are expected to be 
in line with pre-pandemic figures, 
accompanied by an ex-fuel, ex-
inflation estimated CASK (cost per 
ASK) of US¢3.9 cents, an improvement 
of US¢0.6 cents compared to 2019. 
This would lead LATAM to be one of 
the most competitive “full service” 
airline groups.
On November 26, 2021, with broad 
support from the main stakeholders, we 
presented our Reorganization Plan.During the second half of 2022, we 
finally hope to exit Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Law, thus closing an 
important stage of transformation, 
which has enabled the raising of a 
renewed organization, with a solid 
balance sheet, a more competitive cost 
structure, and a good level of liquidity. 
Last year was tough for LATAM and the 
results achieved are the best we could 
get in the face of the adverse context. 
In that task, the workers of the group’s 
companies were key because, in spite 
of all the difficulties, they put their 
effort and willingness into pulling the 
operations through. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank you, because 
despite the frustration and permanent 
uncertainty that you have experienced 
during these years, you have always 
chosen LATAM, you have stood firm, and 
you have accompanied us.
It is precisely that attitude, 
together with all the initiatives and 
achievements and the challenges we 
have set for ourselves, that motivates 
me to look with optimism on the future 
of the group. We face contingency by 
empowering the future. Today, the 
LATAM group comprises more than 29 
thousand people of 44 nationalities, 
who have resisted a pandemic and who 
have learned a lot of lessons. This year, we hope to end one of the most painful 
chapters in our history, emerging much 
better than we started and where, 
together, we will continue to learn so 
that we can become a better LATAM.

The connectivity that drives tourism 
and business is a major impact of 
aviation. Despite reduced travel during 
the pandemic, international passengers 
transported by LATAM to South America 
contributed nearly US$608 million to 
the economies of the region. The figure 
considers the number of passengers 
transported (633.1 thousand) and the 
average expenses per traveler reported 
by tourism and statistics agencies 
in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
Ecuador, and Peru. 203-2In 2020, the group faced the greatest 
challenge in its 91-year history with the 
coronavirus pandemic. As a result of the 
unprecedented impact on passenger and 
cargo operations, LATAM Airlines Group 
S.A. and its subsidiaries in Chile, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru, and the United States filed 
for voluntary protection under the financial 
reorganization statute of the US Chapter 
11 on May 26, 2020, and the subsidiary 
in Brazil joined the process on July 9 of 
the same year. The reorganization gives 
LATAM the opportunity to work with its 
creditors and other stakeholders to reduce 
its debt, access new sources of financing 
and continue to operate, and it gives it 
the opportunity to adapt its business to 
the new reality. The reorganization thus 
seeks to ensure financial sustainability 
and continue to generate shared value 
for its stakeholders.
Despite the adverse global scenario, 
throughout 2021, LATAM remained 
committed to providing connectivity 
and being an asset to the region, while 
restructuring its finances. The group 
managed to resume operations in 
several destinations, reached 70.1% of 
its capacity (measured in ASK, available 
seat-kilometer) in December compared 
to 2019, and continued to support the 
fight against the virus with the Avion 
Solidario  (Solidary Plane) program.More information:

DIMENSION Outlook on 
sustainabilityLATAM promotes sustainable 
development in South America 
and works to preserve the culture 
and biodiversity of the destinations 
it reaches, which are known for their 
natural wealth. To this end, it assumes 
challenging commitments to the 
social, environmental and economic 
growth challenges facing society, which 
include the holistic management of 
its carbon footprint, migration to a 
circular economy model, and tangible 
contribution to communities.
From its sustainability strategy and 
in order to achieve collective and real 
solutions, LATAM engages its internal 
and external stakeholders under a 
collaborative system and implements 
programs to achieve the fulfillment of 
its commitments and goals. The Board, 
the group's highest governing body, 
monitors progress on the achievement 
of the goals and the degree of 
fulfillment of the commitments.
To measure its performance, 
LATAM applies the S&P Corporate 
Sustainability Assessment and the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), which 
selects publicly traded companies with 
the best performance in economic, 
financial, social, environmental, 
governance and compliance, and 
customer relations issues.More information:
Commitment to the 
Future (page 56)In 2021, following the S&P Corporate 
Sustainability Assessment, LATAM was 
recognized as the most sustainable 
airline in the region and the fourth in 
the world, as well as being included 
in the Sustainability Yearbook  2022 in 
the Bronze category, maintaining its 
position as one of the best-performing 
companies in sustainability in the 
industry. The group was also part of 
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 
six consecutive years, being ranked 
as one of the most sustainable in the 
world. Today, LATAM is not within this 
selection because it is undergoing a 
process of financial reorganization, 
but it continues to use the results as 
a benchmark  and guide to implement 
improvements in its processes.

1961Timeline 
    The history of LATAM begins in 1929 
with LAN (Chile's national airline), 
which in 1946, made its first 
international flight on Santiago-Buenos 
Aires to later extend its coverage, first 
to Lima, Peru; then to Miami, United 
States; and later on, to Europe. In 
1983, and through CORFO, Linea Aérea 
Nacional Chile Limitada was established, 
and the following year, it went on to 
become a limited company known 
as LAN Chile. Years later, in 1997, the 
company listed its shares on the New 
York Stock Exchange and was the first 
Latin American airline group to trade its 
ADRs (American Depositary Receipt) in 
this stock market.
In 2012, LAN Airlines S.A. changes its 
name to LATAM Airlines Group S.A. after 
the association of LAN and Brazil's TAM, 
created in 1975 as Transportes Aéreos 
Regionais. The group consolidates the 
leadership initiated by LAN, TAM, and 
their corresponding subsidiaries, with a 
better service throughout its network 
and strengthening its regional position.
These and other more recent 
milestones in the group's trajectory are 
presented below.

States).Creation of LAN

In 2021, the group was able to 
gradually resume operations after 
a 2020 strongly impacted by the 
pandemic, operating, on average 
during the year, 45.4% of the 
passenger capacity (measured in ASK - 
available seat-kilometer) compared to 
the pre-COVID level and a load factor of 
74.4%. The international operation was 
25.2% of that recorded in 2019, and the 
domestic operation was 69.6%. During 
much of 2021, subsidiaries in Colombia 
and Ecuador achieved domestic 
performance equal to or greater than 
that achieved before the pandemic.Throughout the year, LATAM also made 
progress in opening new routes in the 
context of a dynamic and changing 
environment, opening a total of 79 
routes during the year. The revenues 
from the passenger operation 
represented 65.4% of the group's total.
LATAM operates 30 international 
destinations in 18 countries, in 
addition to domestic destinations and 
international flights and connections 
between domestic destinations.
In the international passenger market , 
the supply, measured in ASK, which 
equals the number of seats available 
multiplied by the distance flown, 
decreased by 14.3% compared to 2020, 
and passenger demand, measured in 
RPKs, which equals the total number of 
passengers transported by the distance 
flown, declined by 23.4% compared to 
2020. A total of 2.9 million passengers 
flew with LATAM to international 
destinations during 2021 and the load 
factor was 66.0%, 7 .8 percentage points 
below 2020.
Domestic operations correspond to the 
domestic flights made by the LATAM 
Airlines Brazil, LATAM Airlines Chile, LATAM 
Airlines Colombia, LATAM Airlines Ecuador, and LATAM Airlines Peru subsidiaries, 
which averaged 790 flights per day, 
connecting a total of 107 destinations.
In addition, during 2021, LATAM 
inaugurated 17 new domestic 
destinations and transported 37 .3 
million people on its domestic flights, 
an increase of 53.8% compared to 
the previous year. Passenger demand, 
measured in RPK, increased 60.1% in 
Spanish-speaking countries (SSC), while 
supply, measured in ASK, increased 
62.6%, while the load factor was 74.9%, 
1.2 percentage points lower than in 2020. 
In the Brazilian domestic market, demand 
increased by 40.8%, and supply by 40.8%. 
The load factor remained constant 
compared to 2020 and was 80.0%.
In Colombia, operations toward yearend 
exceeded 2019 levels, reaching an 
operation of 123% 
compared to 2019, 
measured in ASK,  
most of which is 
explained  by the 
opening of four 
new domestic routes (Cali-Monteria, 
Medellin-Pereira, Cali-Pasto, Medellin-
Leticia), whereby the subsidiary e nded  
the year with 16 domestic destinations 
and 180 daily flights on average.In 2021, LATAM opened 
33 new domestic 
destinations, totaling 107 . 
Load factor was 80.0%.LATAM Airlines Ecuador closed the 
year with a 116% operation versus 
2019 levels, given LATAM's interest in 
continuing to connect Ecuador and offer 
the best product to its passengers. 
On the other hand, LATAM Airlines Brazil 
ended 202 1 with  a capacity of 92.9% 
(measured in ASK) compared to 2019, 
with an average of 578 daily flights and  
49 destinations,  a record figure that had 
not been recorded since the association 
of LAN and TAM in 2012. The subsidiary 
opened 33 new routes and opened 
flights to the cities of Juazeiro do 
Norte, Jericoacoara, Petrolina, Vitoria da 
Conquista and Una, among others. 
During December 2021, LATAM's 
subsidiaries in Chile, Brazil, Peru, and 
Ecuador were leaders in market share1 
in their respective markets, while the 
subsidiary in Colombia had the second 
largest operation in that country.

Operations 24LATAM  
   cargoThe drop in cargo carrying capacity, due 
to the decrease in passenger flights 
as a result of health restrictions, was 
more intense than the drop in demand, 
thus increasing the load factor at the 
industry level.
In 2021, 801.5 thousand tons of cargo 
were transported, an increase of 2.2% 
from 2020. Revenues increased 27 .4% 
compared to the previous year and 
represented 30.2% of the group's total. 
Load factor reached 63.4%, which 
translates into a 2.0 percentage-point 
decrease compared to 2020 (+7 .9 
versus 2019) and the yield based on 
ATKs (available ton-kilometer) increased 
by 29.2% compared to 2020 (+68.3% 
vs. 2019). The restrictions forced the 
suspension of several passenger routes, 
which was reflected in a reduction in the 
capacity of the belly cargo service (using 
passenger aircraft).
However, LATAM's effort to operate 
routes that originally only considered 
passenger aircraft as net cargo flights 
represents the group's commitment 
to its customers in businesses 
such as the salmon, fruit, flower, 
pharmaceutical, or mining industries, 
among others, which needed to ensure 
their operational continuity.LATAM Cargo S.A. and the cargo 
subsidiaries in Colombia and Brazil 
stand out in Latin America as one 
of the main air cargo operators. During 
2021, its contribution to the region 
became even more visible in the global 
context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 801.5224

for three years. Thanks to this project, 
today LATAM cargo has a world-class 
system that not only allows it to make 
its operations more efficient, but also 
gives customers the ease of doing 
their business with LATAM cargo and 
its cargo subsidiaries, improving their 
user experience.
The end-to-end platform, which covers 
all processes from pricing to payment, 
is hosted on the cloud, reducing system 
downtime and information loss or errors 
by holding all dispatch data in one place. 
The new system is already in place 
for all international operations and is 
expected that all of its capabilities will 
be taken advantage of and implemented 
for domestic operations during 2022.
During the fourth quarter, LATAM cargo 
announced two major international 
marketplace  agreements to expand the 
channels where it offers its capacity.More information:

In 2021, LATAM cargo strengthened 
its operations to support the mass 
transportation of vaccines to and 
within South America and domestic 
markets. This was made possible by 
a multidisciplinary effort involving 
different areas of the business, 
enabling the creation of new 
procedures and optimizing logistics  
and coping with the pandemic.
The initiative positioned LATAM group,  
and LATAM cargo specifically, as 
a strategic ally of governments to 
meet the logistical challenge of mass 
vaccination campaigns. In total, LATAM 
was responsible for transporting one 
in five doses of vaccines administered 
by Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, 
Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay. In countries such as Chile and 
Paraguay, coverage was even higher: 
two out of three.The Center of Excellence of Independent 
Validators (CEIV Pharma) certification 
from the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) was key for this, as 
it proved to each of the Latin American 
governments the robustness of LATAM's 
Pharma services and the experience and 
knowledge of the group to transport 
vaccines with all kinds of requirements.
The first vaccines were transported on 
December 24, 2020, and until the end 
of 2021, 351,853,590 doses of COVID 
vaccines were transported to South 
America, including the countries of the 
continent and at the domestic level. Of 
these, 207,750,400 were transported 
free of charge at the domestic level on 
the Avion Solidario (Solidary Plane) in 
Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru, within 
the framework of the program's alliances 
with local governments to facilitate 
distribution at the national level.million doses

Operations 27The results of the negotiations were 
favorable, and the extension of pay 
periods and variable pay and the reduction 
of lease payments were agreed. 
As at 31 December 2021, 3101 aircraft 
made up LATAM's total fleet, with an 
average age of 10.9 years.
The international operations have 591 
Boeing wide-body aircraft, including 22 
Boeing 767-300ER, 10 Boeing 777-
300EF and 27 Boeing 787 Dreamliners 
(versions 8 and 9), worldwide 
benchmarks for fuel efficiency and 
reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and noise. The fleet for 
domestic and regional operations 
in South America consists of Airbus 
aircraft, mainly of the narrow-body 
type, including 44 Airbus A319, 133 
Airbus A320, 49 Airbus A321, and 12 
Airbus A320neo, which is 15% more fuel 
efficient and generates half the noise 
than the previous equivalent model.
LATAM Cargo's operating fleet totals 
12 Boeing 767 aircraft. In 2021, the 
group launched a three-year plan, 
which will expand the fleet to 21 
aircraft, increasing its capacity by 85%. 
By the end of the year, the first of the 
10 new cargo planes converted from 
Boeing 767 passenger aircraft was 
fulfilled, and the fleet is expected to Fleet 
In 2021, as part of the reorganization 
process, the group achieved a full 
restructuring of its fleet, which 
included renegotiating contracts, 
reducing total aircraft, eliminating 
Airbus A350 models, and homologating 
wide-body aircraft. These initiatives 
will enable estimated savings of more 
than 40 per cent of fleet cash costs 
compared to 2019 l evels.Fleet (12/31/2021)

2022 and six in 2023. 
In addition, within the framework 
of the reorganization process, fleet 
commitment agreements have been 
reached with Boeing for two 787 
Dreamliner aircraft and with Airbus 
for a total of 70 more fuel-efficient 
aircraft from the

current global situation.
Maintenance
Aircraft maintenance, planning, and 
return activities in compliance with the 
fleet plan are carried out at LATAM's 
Maintenance, Repair, and Operation 
(MRO) bases in Chile and Brazil. 
The units also perform temporary 
maintenance services to third parties. 
The Chilean base is located in Santiago 
and can serve two narrow-body and one 
wide-body aircraft simultaneously. In Brazil, the base is located in São Carlos 
and has capacity for eight aircraft.
In 2021, the two bases were 
responsible for 446 maintenance 
services, representing 83 per cent of 
total fleet maintenance and a total 
of 1.3 million man-hours worked. The 
rest of the aircraft were serviced by 
external suppliers.
Line maintenance (minor, preventive, 
and corrective tasks) is distributed 
across different LATAM hangars, such 
as those located in Santiago (Chile); 
São Carlos, Congonhas/São Paulo, and 
Brasilia (Brazil); Lima (Peru), and Miami 
(United States). This network includes 
a series of automated and integrated 
services that ensure compliance with all 
safety requirements and in accordance 
with local and international regulations.LATAM has planned 
to modernize its fleet until
 2028 with the 
incorporation 
of 70 aircraft of the
Airbus A320neo family 
and two Boeing 787-9Snapshot

Corporate governance 32The main governing body of LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. is the Board, 
which defines and monitors 
the group’s strategic guidelines. It 
consists of nine permanent members, 
individually elected for two-year 
periods, by the cumulative voting 
system. Each shareholder has one vote 
per share and may cast all their votes in 
favor of a single candidate or distribute 
them among several. This practice 
ensures that shareholders of 10% of the 
shares on the market may choose at 
least one representative. 102-18Decision-making   
bodies
The Board holds regular monthly 
meetings and, whenever necessary, 
extraordinary meetings. In 2021, 
the average attendance at the 35 
ordinary and extraordinary sessions held 
throughout the year was 96.8%. Directors 
Ignacio Cueto, Enrique Cueto, Patrick 
Horn and Nicolas Eblen attended 100% 
of the meetings, while directors Enrique 
Ostale, Sonia Villalobos, Henri Philippe 
Reichstul, Eduardo Novoa, and Alexander 
Wilcox attended 94.3% of the meetings.
In addition to the Directors’ or Audit 
Committees, four sub-committees 
support the Board in decision-making: 
Strategy & Sustainability, Leadership, 
Finance, and Clients.
As part of a self-assessment process, 
the Board members routinely fill out 
a form on best practices, required by 
Chile's Financial Market Commission 
(CMF, for its Spanish acronym).Directors Committee
The Directors’ Committee is composed 
of members of the Board and its 
functions consist mainly of reviewing 
and evaluating the reports from external 
auditors, balance sheets, and other 
financial statements, and proposing 
to the Shareholders' Meeting the 
names of external auditors and risk-
rating agencies. The Committee also 
serves as the Audit Committee. This 
composition meets the requirements of 
the Chilean Corporations Act (LSA, for 
its Spanish acronym), the standards 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the 
guidelines of the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC).At December 31, 2021, the Committee 
included Eduardo Novoa Castellon, Patrick 
Horn Garcia, and Nicolas Eblen Hirmas. All 
three are considered independent under 
section 10A of the SecuritiesExchange Act.
According to the Chilean LSA, only the 
first two have independent board member 
status. Said law requires two independent 
board members; that is, who have no 
links, interests, economic, professional, 
credit, or commercial dependence of 
any relevant nature or volume on the 
company, the other subsidiaries of 
the Group, its controller, or the main 
executives, nor any family ties with the 
latter, among other characteristics.96.8% it was the average 
attendance at the 
regular meetings of the 
Board in 2021.

Compensation plans
Compensation plans implemented 
through the awarding of stock options 
to buy and pay for shares offered 
by the group to its employees are 
recognized in the Financial Statements 
pursuant to IFRS 2 “Share-Based 
Payments” . These plans report 
the effect of the fair value on the 
options awarded as a linear charge to 
remunerations between the date when 
said options are granted and the date 
when they become irrevocable.
• LP3 Compensation plan (2020-2023):  
LATAM implemented a program for a 
group of executives, lasting until March 
2023, with a vesting period between 
October 2020 and March 2023, where 
the collection percentage is annual and 
cumulative. The methodology is an 
allocation of a number of units, where a 
target value is set for the stock.The bonus is activated if the price target 
of the stock, defined each year, is met. 
Should the bonus be accrued, until 
the last year, the total bonus shall be 
doubled (if the stock price is activated). 
This compensation plan has not been 
provisioned yet, as the callable stock 
price stands below the initial target.Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 20, 
2021. During 2021, the Board and the 
Directors’ Committee had no additional 
expenses for counseling services.

Corporate governance 36Related-party transactions
LATAM has a Related-Party Transactions 
Control Policy applicable to the parent, 
all subsidiaries, all members of the 
LATAM group, as well as their directors, 
employees, and partners.
The policy states that such transactions 
must be conducted in accordance with 
the law, under market conditions, and 
focused on contributing to the social 
interest. The document also establishes 
the cases in which it is appropriate to 
submit such transactions for evaluation 
by the Directors’ Committee and for the 
approval of the Board of Directors or the 
Shareholders' Meeting, per legal definition.
The consolidated financial statements 
for the financial year ended December 
31, 2021, report the transactions carried out in 2021 between LATAM and its 
subsidiaries. For more information, see 
note 33  of the Financial Statements.
Political Contributions
The Policy on Political Contributions 
sets out guidelines for possible financial 
support to parties and candidates during 
election campaigns in all the countries 
where the group operates. Contributions 
must adhere to current local legislation 
and be in line with the LATAM Code of 
Conduct. Since the creation of the policy 
in late 2016, the group has not made 
any political contributions. 415-1
Relations with authorities
The aviation industry is regulated and 
supervised by the various regulatory 
authorities of the countries where the 
group operates. Ethics and integrity outline LATAM's relationships with 
those agencies and other regulatory 
entities, and all meetings with 
their representatives are recorded 
on a platform monitored by the 
Compliance area. 102-40
Membership of associations
LATAM is in constant talks with sector 
organizations and public and regulatory 
agencies, seeking to define strategies 
and paths that can benefit not only the 
organization, but the whole aviation 
industry and, more generally, society.The ethics channel receives reports on 
breaches of laws and internal rules, such 
as breaches of the Code of Conduct, 
labor irregularities, discrimination, 
labor and sexual harassment, fraud, 
corruption, and bribery, among others. 
The channel guarantees confidentiality 
and is managed by a specialized third-
party provider, who performs the initial evaluation of all records. When 
necessary, the cases are transferred 
to the Code of Conduct Management 
Committee in each country (which is 
comprised of representatives from 
various areas) and is responsible for 
ensuring that the cases are channeled  
as required. 102-17Ethics Channel

Corporate governance 37Financing   
       Policy
The scope of LATAM’s Financing Policy 
is to meet the group’s financing 
needs, including the acquisition 
of fleet assets, such as aircraft and 
engines, financing other investments, 
and financing working capital.During 2021, as part of the 
reorganization process under Chapter 
11 of the United States Bankruptcy 
Law which it is undergoing, LATAM 
obtained Tranche B of the debtor in 
possession financing, or DIP, for US$750 
million, due April 8, 2022. Together 
with the US$2.45 billion that the 
group already had since 2020, it totals 
US$3.20 billion. Of these, US$1.95 
billion are drawn at 31 December 2020, 
leaving US$1.25 billion available to 
draft. In this way, the group succeeded 
in strengthening its operation.
Recently, on March 14, 2022, LATAM 
presented a new DIP financing proposal 
consisting of a group of financiers 
who are considering an extension 
of the maturity date for the three 
tranches of the DIP contract until 
August 8, 2022, with the possibility of 
a further extension. This proposal was 
subsequently approved by the court on 
March 15, 2022.Moreover, at the beginning of the 
period, the group had a committed 
credit line with a 12-bank consortium 
for US$600 million that is fully 
available (Revolving Credit Facility 
– RCF). This line is subject to the 
availability of the collateral consisting 
of aircrafts, spare engines, and overall 
spare parts. During the period, LATAM 
held 100% of this line.
This year, as in the previous one, LATAM 
has reduced most of its recurrent 
investments, which usually correspond 
to fleet acquisition programs. Normally, 
LATAM finances between 70% and 85% 
of the value of the assets through 
bank loans, bonds covered by the 
export promotion agencies, or through 
commercial loans, capital investments, 
or the Company’s own funds. The 
payment schedules of the various 
aircraft financing structures are mostly 
for 12 years. Moreover, LATAM contracts 
a large part of its fleet purchase 
commitments through operating leases 
as an additional source of financing.
During 2021, LATAM has focused its 
resources on maintaining the operation 
and adjusting fleet size in line with 
current and projected demand in the 
coming years, considering the pandemic 
that exists worldwide. In this sense, as part of the reorganization process 
which it is undergoing, LATAM has 
devoted its efforts to the restructuring 
of fleet contracts, achieving a decrease 
in payment obligations during the 
current year and extending our maturing 
obligations for 
several more years.
Another of the 
main goals of the 
Financing Policy is to ensure a stable 
debt maturity and leasing commitment 
profile, including debt servicing and the 
payments on fleet leases, consistent 
with the generation of LATAM’s projected 
operating cash flow, considering the 
effect of the pandemic on the latter.The group restructured its 
fleet contracts for 
2021 and the future

Corporate governance 38Market   
   Risk Policy  
Given the nature of its operations, 
LATAM Airlines Group S .A. is 
subject to market risks, such as: 
(i) fuel price risk, (ii) interest rate risk, 
and (iii) exchange rate risk. In order to 
hedge fully or partially against these 
risks, LATAM uses financial derivatives 
to reduce the adverse effects that 
these risks could cause.  Market risk is managed integrally and 
considers the correlation with each 
market factor to which the group is 
exposed. In order to operate with each 
counterpart, the Company must have 
an approved line and a framework 
signed with it.
Fuel price risk: Variations in fuel prices 
depend significantly on oil supply and 
demand in the world, as well as on the 
decisions made by the Organization 
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC), the refining capacity worldwide, 
inventory levels, and the occurrence 
or absence of climatic phenomena or 
geopolitical factors. LATAM purchases 
aircraft fuel, known as jet fuel . For the 
execution of fuel hedges, there is a 
benchmark index on the international 
market for this underlying asset, which 
is the Jet Fuel 54 US Gulf Coast, used 
mostly by LATAM Airlines Group S.A. to 
make hedges during 2021. LATAM also 
carries out hedges on NYMEX Heating 
Oil, whose underlying asset is included 
in the Fuel Risk Hedging Policy, given its 
high correlation with Jet Fuel 54.The Fuel Hedging Policy sets 
a minimum and a maximum 
hedging range for the group's fuel 
consumption, based on the capacity 
to pass through fuel price variations 
to airfares, anticipated sales, and the 
competitive scenario. Moreover, this 
Policy sets hedging zones, a premiums 
budget, and other strategic restrictions that are assessed and presented 
periodically before the LATAM Finance 
Committee.
With regard to fuel hedging instruments, 
the Policy makes it possible to contract 
combined Swaps and Options only for 
hedging purposes, and does not allow 
the net sale of options.
Integrated Report 2021
Corporate governance 39Interest rate risk on cash flows: 
Interest rate variations depend largely 
on the state of the global economy. 
An improvement in the long-term 
economic outlook pushes long-term 
rates upwards, whereas a drop causes a 
decrease due to market effects. 
However, considering government 
intervention, during periods of economic 
contraction, reference rates are usually 
cut in order to boost aggregate demand 
by making credit more affordable and 
increasing production (just as there 
are hikes in the reference rates during 
periods of economic expansion). 
The uncertainty surrounding how the 
market and the governments will behave, 
and thus, how the interest rate will 
change, leads to a risk related to LATAM's 
debt subject to variable interest, its 
investments, and the new issuances it 
may make. Interest rate risk on existing 
debt materializes in the impact on 
future cash flows related to financial 
instruments, given the interest rate 
fluctuations. Thus, a higher interest rate 
could translate into a higher cash flow 
from interest payments, and vice versa.  
LATAM’s exposure to the risk from 
market interest rate fluctuations is 
mainly related to long-term obligations 
with variable rates. In order to reduce the risk from an 
eventual hike in interest rates, LATAM 
can use interest rate swap or other 
derivatives contracts.
At December 31, 2021, LATAM has 
no active interest rates derivatives 
contracts. These positions were closed in 
advance by the respective counterparties 
once the group entered the Chapter 11 
reorganization process.
Exchange rate risks:  The functional 
currency used by the parent Company 
is the US dollar. There are two types 
of exchange rate risks: Flow risk and 
balance sheet risk. 
Cash flow risk is a consequence of 
the net revenue position and costs in 
currencies other than US dollars. LATAM 
makes sales of its services in US dollars, 
local currencies, and US dollar-indexed 
prices. In the international passenger 
business, most fares depend on the 
US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the 
euro. In domestic businesses, most 
rates are in local currency without any 
dollar indexing, except for domestic 
businesses in Peru and Ecuador, for 
which both rates and sales are in dollars. 
On the other hand, some of the group’s 
expenses are denominated in US dollars 
or equivalent to the USD, particularly 
fuel costs, aviation taxes, aircraft leases, insurance, and aircraft components 
and accessories. Other expenses, 
such as compensation expenses, are 
denominated in local currencies.
Thereby, LATAM is exposed to the 
fluctuations in various currencies, 
mainly the Brazilian Real. LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. has not hedged 
against exchange rate risks involving 
the Brazilian Real during 2021.
On the other hand, balance sheet risks 
appear when entries in the balance sheet 
are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, 
given that said entries are expressed in 
a currency unit other than the functional 
currency. While 
LATAM may sign 
hedging derivatives 
contracts to protect 
against the impact of a potential currency 
appreciation or depreciation vs. the 
functional currency used by the parent 
Company, during 2021, LATAM made no 
hedges against balance sheet risk.
The main mismatch factor is seen in 
TAM S.A., whose functional currency is 
the Brazilian Real, and as most of its 
liabilities are stated in U.S. dollars, even 
though its assets are stated in local 
currency. At December 31, 2021, the 
liability position of TAM S.A. exceeded 
the asset position by US$535 million.The functional currency 
used by the parent 
Company is the US dollar

     Policy
The Corporate Finance Department 
is responsible for managing the 
Company's Financial Policy. This 
Policy makes it possible to effectively 
face changes in conditions outside the 
business normal operation and thus 
maintain and anticipate a stable flow 
of funds to ensure the operation’s 
continuity and the fulfillment of 
financial obligations.
Moreover, the Finance Committee, 
comprising the Executive Vice-
Presidency and members of LATAM's 
Board, meets periodically to review and 
propose to the Board the approval of 
issues that are not regulated by the 
Financial Policy. LATAM Airlines Group 
S.A. Financial Policy aims to achieve the 
following goals:• To preserve and maintain suitable 
cash flow levels to ensure the 
requirements of the operations, to 
support growth, and to fulfill the 
group's financial obligations.
• To maintain a suitable level of credit 
lines with local and foreign banks to 
gain access to additional liquidity to 
face contingencies.
• To maintain an optimal debt level, 
diversify financing sources, manage 
the debt maturity profile, and 
minimize the cost of financing.
• Capitalize excess cash flow through 
financial investments that will 
guarantee a risk and liquidity 
level consistent with the Financial 
Investment Policy.
• To reduce the effects of market 
risks, such as variations in fuel prices, 
exchange rates, and interest rates on the 
group's net margin and cash position.• To manage counterparty risk through 
the diversification and limits on 
investments and transactions with 
counterparties. 
• To maintain, at all times, a long-
term visibility of the group's 
projected financial situation to 
anticipate situations of low liquidity, 
deterioration of the financial ratios 
agreed with rating agencies, etc.

Corporate governance 41Liquidity and   
Financial Investment Policy  
LATAM seeks to maintain an 
adequate liquidity position for the 
purpose of safeguarding against 
potential external shocks and the 
volatility and cycles inherent in the 
industry. In this sense, it had closed 
the financial year 2019 with adequate 
liquidity, with a liquidity ratio at 
December 2019 of 19.7% on the total 
income of the last 12 months. This liquidity considered the cash 
available and short-term liquid 
investments in addition to a revolving 
credit line committed for a total of 
US$600 million with 12 financial 
institutions, both local and international 
(the RCF or revolving credit facility).
During 2020, as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the airline business 
in general was seriously affected. 
Specifically, revenues from passenger 
sales declined sharply while requests 
for refunds increased. To address this 
situation, LATAM initially drew the RCF 
completely between March and April.
Subsequently, on May 26, 2020, 
LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and some 
of its subsidiaries filed for the judicial 
reorganization process established in 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Law. On 
July 9, LATAM Airlines Brazil and other 
subsidiaries of the group joined the same 
process. Within this process, LATAM 
obtained financing known as debtor in possession, or “DIP, ” which has the 
feature of giving its creditors priority to 
payment over the group's other unsecured 
obligations. On October 8, 2020, LATAM 
closed the DIP, which has a US$2.45 billion 
committed line with different investors. 
On the same day, it received a first draft 
worth US$1.15 billion, thus ending the year 
with US$1.30 billion of this line committed 
and available to be drafted depending on 
the group's needs. Measured as cash plus 
available DIPs as a percentage of total 
revenues for 2020, LATAM closed the 
year with a liquidity indicator of 68%.
During 2021, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. 
and its subsidiaries continued to pursue 
the reorganization process under Chapter 
11, and therefore continued to draft DIP 
funds totaling US$800 million during 
the year. Also, on October 18, 2021, 
the South District Court of New York 
approved the motion to finance Tranche 
B of LATAM's DIP funding worth US$750 
million. The main objective of financing 
this tranche was to lower the average 
cost of the full DIP, while also helping to 
further strengthen the group's liquidity. 
Apart from the sums drawn and adding 
the other US$750 million, at the end 
of the year, LATAM closed available DIP 
amounts of US$1.25 billion. Adding the 
group's cash, LATAM closed with a total 
liquidity of US$2.29 billion and a liquidity 
index of 45%.With regard to the Financial Investment 
Policy, its goal is to centralize 
investment decisions to optimize 
profitability, adjusted for currency 
risk, subject to maintaining suitable 
security and liquidity levels. Moreover, 
the aim is to manage risk through 
the diversification of counterparties, 
maturities, currencies, and instruments. 
In terms of interest rates, the 
years 2020 and 2021 were globally 
characterized by very low rates. In 
addition, the Chapter 11 process, 
in paragraph 345(b), regulates the 
holding of cash for companies under 
reorganization. In compliance with 
this regulation, at the end of the year, 
LATAM held most of its deposits in 
depositor banks authorized by the US 
Trustee of the Southern District of 
New York of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court  
(authorized depository banks).

Regulation  
(page 117)
Material facts  
(page 125)In the midst of the spread of the new 
omicron variant of COVID-19 and the 
emergence of significant inflationary 
pressures, the global economy has 
begun 2022 in a weaker position than 
previously expected. On the one hand, 
the omicron variant has led some 
countries to reimpose certain mobility 
restrictions, while disruptions in the 
logistics chain and rising oil and energy 
prices have generated high levels of 
inflation, which have mainly affected 
the United States and emerging and 
developing economies. The International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) expects 
inflationary pressures to last longer than 
previously estimated, as a result of the 
continuity of disruptions in 2022 in the 
logistics chain and high energy prices, 
and they should gradually decrease 
during the year as the supply-demand 
imbalances recover, and with the 
implementation of monetary policies 
in major economies. In addition, in the 
context of the conflict between Russia 
and Ukraine and the effects of this on the oil supply, there has been a sharp 
rise in fuel prices, a factor that could 
continue to significantly impact global 
inflationary pressures.
In line with this challenging environment 
for the global economy, the IMF’s 
latest projections consider a cross-
cutting downward adjustment between 
economies for new factors not foreseen 
in the previous projection related to the 
early withdrawal of fiscal stimuli mainly 
in the US, disruptions in the logistics 
chain, the spread of the omicron 
variant, and the instability of the real 
estate sector in China. However, in its 
last projection in January 2022, the 
IMF estimated growth for the global 
economy of 5.9% for 2021, while it 
projected growth of 4.4% in 2022 (0.5 
percentage points (p.p.) below the 
previous estimate), and more moderate 
growth of 3.8% in 2023.
For the United States, the IMF has 
estimated a 4.0% expansion for 2022 
in its last projection in January (0.6 
percentage points below the last 
October 2021 estimate), in response 
to the early withdrawal of monetary 
policies and the continuity of 
disruptions in the logistics chain; and 
growth of 2.6% for 2023, 0.4 p.p. above 
the previous estimate. On the other 
hand, the IMF’s estimates for Europe during 2022 have also been revised 
downwards from the previous estimate, 
expecting  growth of 3.9% in 2022 (0.4 
p.p. lower versus the previous estimate), 
and an expansion of 2.5% in 2023, 0.5 
p.p. above the last estimate. 
On the other hand, the IMF estimated 
growth of 2.4% for the Latin American 
and Caribbean region during 2022, 
0.6 percentage points below the 
previous October 2021 forecast, and 
an expansion of 2.6% for 2023. Brazil's 
economy is expected to grow by 0.3% 
in 2022, which is 1.2 percentage points 
below the previous estimate, while for 
Chile, the Central Bank estimated in its 
last Monetary Policy Report (IPoM, for 
its Spanish acronym) in December 2021 
an economic expansion in the range of 
1.5 to 2.5% by 2022.
In order to analyze the economic 
environment in which the Company 
exists, below we present a brief 
explanation of the situation and 
evolution of the main economies that 
affect it nationally, regionally, and 
worldwide.

Our business 44Financial  
    results
At December 31, 2021, the 
controller reported a loss of 
ThUS$4,647,491, representing 
a negative variance of ThUS$101,604 
compared to a loss of ThUS$4,545,887 
in the same period last year. Net margin 
for the financial year settled at -90.9% 
in 2021 and -104.9% during 2020.The operating result for the twelve 
months of 2021 amounts to a loss 
of ThUS$1,119,277, which compared 
to the loss of ThUS$1,665,288 as 
at December 31, 2020, shows a 
variation equivalent to -32.8%, while 
operating margin settles at -21.9%, 
16.5 percentage points higher than the 
-38.4% reported on December 31, 2020.
Operating income for the financial year 
increased 17 .9% vs. the same period of 
2020, totaling ThUS$5,111,346. This 
increase is largely due to a 23.2% rise 
in passenger revenues and 27 .4% in 
cargo revenues, while other revenues 
decreased by 44.7%. The effect of the 
Brazilian real’s depreciation represents 
lower ordinary revenues by around 
US$40 million.
During June 2020, the indefinite 
cease of operations of LATAM Airlines 
Argentina S.A. was announced due to 
local industry conditions aggravated by 
the COVID-19 pandemic, whereby the 
airline stopped operating 12 domestic 
destinations. At the end of 2020, LATAM Airlines Argentina S.A. reported 
operating revenues of US$50 million in 
its individual income statement.
PAX revenues totaled ThUS$3,342,381 
which, compared to the ThUS$2,713,774 
from the twelve months of 2020, 
translates into a 23.2% increase. This 
variation is due to the 18.0% increase 
in demand measured in RPK (revenue 
passenger-kilometer) and 4.3% in the 
yields compared to the previous year, 
while load factor shows a negative 
variation of 2.1 percentage points 
from the financial year 2020; on the 
other hand, RASK (revenue per ASK – 
Available Seat-Kilometer) reported a 
1.4% increase, explained by the recovery 
of demand thanks to the lifting of 
quarantines and travel restrictions since 
the second half of the current year.
As at 31 December 2021, cargo 
revenues reached ThUS$1,541,634, a 
27 .4% increase from 2020. Despite the 
1.4% drop in RTK traffic, yields  increased 
29.2%, driven mainly by a strong import 
and export scenario.The Other Income line item shows a 
decrease of ThUS$183,671 mainly 
due to a fall in Tour Services and plane 
subleasing worth ThUS$55,990, in 
addition to the compensation received 
for the cancellation of the purchase of 
four A350 aircraft from Delta Air Lines 
Inc. for ThUS$62,000 and ThUS$9,240 
from the advance return of leased 
aircraft to Qatar Airways, both during 
the second quarter of 2020, added to 
the negative change in compensation 
income received from Delta Air Lines 
Inc., associated with the implementation 
of the JBA (joint business agreement) 
signed in 2019 for ThUS$14,279.
At December 31, 2021, operating 
costs totaled THUS$6,230,623 
which, compared to 2020, translate 
into higher costs by THUS$230,666, 
equivalent to a 3.8% increase, whereas 
unit cost per ASK decreased by 
14.5%. Furthermore, the effect of the 
Brazilian Real’s depreciation on this 
line item translates into lower costs by 
roughly US$38 million. Item variations 
are explained as follows:
Integrated Report 2021
Our business 45a) Remunerations and benefits 
increased ThUS$79,839 due to 
higher recognized expenditures for 
performance bonuses, which were 
suspended during financial year 2020, 
partly offset by an 18% decline in 
the average payroll compared to the 
previous year.
b) Fuel increased 42.3%, equivalent 
to ThUS$442,433. This increase 
corresponds mainly to 25.4% higher 
average unhedged prices and 15.5% 
growth in consumption measured 
in gallons. LATAM recognized a 
ThUS$10,100 fuel hedge profit in 
2021, compared to a ThUS$14,316 
loss in the twelve months of 2020.
c) Commissions show a decrease of 
ThUS$2,701, as a result of the increase 
in direct sales in own agencies and 
digital media during 2021.
d) Depreciation and Amortization 
decreased by ThUS$223,992, mainly 
explained by a smaller average 
fleet during 2021 and the penalties 
levied in the previous year due to 
the accelerated term of IT projects 
resulting from the implementation of 
the LATAM XP digital platform.e) Other Leases and Landing Fees 
increased ThUS$35,183, mainly in 
handling costs, impacted by the recovery 
of the operation during the second half 
of 2021 and offset by lower airport fees.
f) Passenger Service decreased by 
ThUS$20,325, representing a variation 
of 20.8%, mainly due to restrictions on 
in-flight catering services, imposed as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
lower costs of passenger assistance due 
to contingencies. 
g) Aircraft Lease costs for 
ThUS$120,630. Since the second 
quarter of 2021, operational aircraft 
leases under variable mode were 
reported, as a result of the various 
agreements reached by the group.
Aircraft Leasing includes the costs 
associated with leasing payments by the 
hour (PBH) for contracts that have been 
modified by incorporating that structure. 
For these contracts that include variable 
payments by the hour (PBH) at the 
beginning of the period and after that, 
have fixed fees, an asset by right of use 
and lease liability were recognized for 
these amounts at the date of contract 
modification. These sums continue to 
be amortized on a linear basis during the term of the lease from the date of 
contract modification, even if at the 
beginning they have a variable payment 
period. Therefore, and as a result of the 
application of the lease accounting policy, 
the result of the period includes both the 
leasing expense for variable payments 
(Aircraft leasing) as well as the expense 
resulting from the amortization of the 
right of use included in the depreciation 
line and the interest on the lease liability.
h) Maintenance has higher costs by 
ThUS$61,356, equivalent to 13.0%, 
mainly due to a higher operation since 
the second half of the current year.
i) The Other Operating Costs show a 
decrease of ThUS$261,757, mainly 
due to adjustments in the estimates 
of write-offs and tax, labor, and civil 
proceedings.
Financial revenues totaled ThUS$21,107 
which, compared to ThUS$50,397 in 
2020, represent lower revenues by 
ThUS$29,290. Despite higher cash 
levels during the six-month period 
compared to the same period in 2020, 
this reduction is due to the limitations 
of Chapter 11 on the group’s cash 
management, requiring 70% of the cash 
to be maintained in authorized banks.
Integrated Report 2021

Safety 51Ongoing improvement of procedures, 
constant monitoring of performance, 
and team engagement strengthen the 
safety culture.
Safety indicators on flights, 
maintenance and cargo activities, land 
operations and those related to airport 
infrastructure are monitored by the 
Vice President of Security, reported 
monthly to the CEO, and are part of the 
Board's agenda.
The constant presence of this value 
in its in-house campaigns raises 
awareness of the importance of 
safe behavior and an online platform 
receives notifications of incidents and 
detours. The information is used for 
the construction of a risk map and 
for improvement plans. In 2021, the 
platform received an average of 6.17 
reports per 100 flights.Security Management System
Several actions make up the Security 
Management System, whose interaction 
allows you to track your performance 
in all areas, identify risk situations 
in advance, and make decisions to 
mitigate them in a coordinated and 
rapid manner, thus allowing you to 
achieve concrete results.
The information that feeds the system 
is acquired primarily from employee-
delivered safety reports, automated 
data collection systems, and audits. In 
this sense, audits are divided into three 
groups: Periodic internal audits, which 
assess the maturity of the operational The safety of passengers, 
employees, and communities 
is a key value for LATAM. Their 
management adheres to the Safety,

audits based on IOSA (IATA Operational 
Safety Audit) guidelines, which aim 
to ensure that all subsidiaries comply 
with certification parameters; and IOSA 
recertification audits, which can be 
performed every two years, if in-person, 
or annually, if performed remotely. 
All of LATAM's subsidiaries have been 
certified since 2007 .
The matrix of risk factors and 
criticality is systematically updated, 
considering an analysis of the group's 
internal data, as well as the historical 
analysis of the global behavior of the 
airline industry.
Integrated Report 2021
Safety 52Flight Data
A computer system collects 96.5% 
of the information of each flight; it 
processes the data automatically 
to identify deviations in operational 
procedures and to guide preventive 
maintenance actions. LATAM analyzes 
deviations causes in detail and adopts 
corrective measures.
The time to receive and process flight 
data has been significantly reduced 
with improved processes and constant 
fleet monitoring. This is proven by data 
comparison: In 2019, this measurement 
began, with 75% of the flight data 
processed within the first three days, 
and in 2021, it was possible, in the 
same period, to process 93.1% of the 
information. For 3G-equipped aircraft, 
data download and processing is 
immediate at the end of the flight.
The coverage of the system has been 
increasing since its commissioning 
in 2016, collecting a greater number 
of parameters and with greater 
accuracy. It went from covering 1,280 
measurements per second to a total of 
4,000 in 2021.
The data feed the Operational Safety 
monitoring panel, where it is possible 
to see the differentiated execution: 
by route, by airport, by fleet, by type of deviation, etc. The reports are sent 
weekly to the managers of each fleet.
There is also pilot segmented 
information, whose data is available in 
the Pilot LATAM application. Through 
it, pilots can view the details of 
their performance, access incidents 
identified during flights, deviations 
from planning, and compare it to the 
average of the fleet to which they 
belong. Pilot data is treated with 
absolute confidentiality.
Safety II
In 2021, progress was made on the 
implementation of the Safety II or 
Data Learning for Safety (DLS) concept. 
LATAM has been a pioneer in the sector 
in the use of routine operation data in 
the development, analysis, and action 
plans to improve operational safety. 
The group has matured its capacity 
to collect and analyze data between 
different areas and factors that interact 
in the operation, such as: scheduling, 
maintenance, meteorology, training, 
planning, and fatigue, among others, by 
permanently adding new data sources 
that may affect operating performance.
At the end of 2021, the first module of 
the project became operational, consisting 
of an information panel focused on 
approaches. With this instrument, LATAM accesses and correlates the different 
databases, allowing it to analyze 
the variables with potential to affect 
operating performance.
Thanks to this approach to data, the 
group has been able to extract valuable 
information from its operations, 
considering more than six data sources, 
which are now correlated for an 
analysis that has never been achieved 
before, with more than 65 terabytes 
Aircraft maintenance in

flights. In addition, the speed of data 
processing and analysis has improved 
dramatically, reducing periods that 
took weeks or even months to just 
minutes. In 2022, LATAM will seek to 
further strengthen the data collection 
and inputting process in the different 
databases, as well as to strengthen the 
development of its tools to improve 
its analysis capacity within the large 
volume of information.

Safety 53Airport Security
LATAM follows national and international 
standards and invests in the continuous 
improvement of its processes so that 
passengers and transported cargo arrive 
safely at their destinations. 
The focus of work during 2021 was on 
three axes:
•  Adaptation to the pandemic:  
Attention to governments’ restrictions, 
which impacted the closure of borders, 
and implementation of new protocols 
targeting inadmissible passengers 
(the result of non-compliance with 
health requirements) and disruptive 
passengers (those who do not comply 
with the required indications);
•  Technology : updating and 
strengthening of remote monitoring 
systems, which complement 
physical safety measures, to support 
operations according to current 
regulations; and
•  Profiling:  These are pilot tests that 
allow a profile of the passengers, at 
certain points of origin, to be made in 
order to avoid inadmissible passengers 
in recurring destinations.

passengers who do not respect the rules 
related to restrictions implemented due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by 
18% of people who cause trouble due to 
alcohol abuse.
Throughout the year, LATAM held talks 
in support of the cabin operation 
through which it provided tools to 
handle cases of disruptive passengers 
from a psychological perspective, along 
with strengthening procedures for 
operational areas, through meetings and 
communiqués.

Commitment to the future 56Strategic  
        focusThis is the basis of its new sustainability 
strategy, which brings together 
commitments and serves as a compass 
for the group's progress over the next 
30 years.  The strategy, launched in 
2021, represents the evolution of the 
work that LATAM has developed for 
years to respond to the climate, social, 
and health needs of the region.
The strategy is the result of a broad 
process of reflection and rethinking 
carried out throughout 2020 and 
involving LATAM's main strategic 
stakeholders. Through more than 30 
meetings held in Brazil, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru and Chile, LATAM 
held talks with clients, employees, 
students, academia, researchers, 
experts, representatives of non-
governmental organizations, and 
entities from different productive 
sectors to know their expectations, 
priorities, and vision for the future. 
The exchange of ideas enabled LATAM 
to define how to contribute actively to 
building a fairer society for today and 
for future generations.
The new strategy strengthens the group's 
role as an asset to the countries where it 
operates. The main initiatives undertaken 
in 2021, in the passenger and cargo 
business units, to reach the commitments 
are explained in the next pages.COMMITMENT

LATAM seeks to be an asset that 
promotes the social, environmental, 
and economic development of the 
region. To achieve this, it maintains 
the connection with the demands 
and desires of the people, and works 
collaboratively in the search for 
collective solutions. Everyone’s Commitment
To drive these commitments in the 
organization, LATAM implemented the 
Sustainability Ambassadors program, 
made up of employees who promote and 
communicate new sustainability initiatives, 
generate awareness, and encourage a 
sustainable culture and lifestyle.
The 350 ambassadors in 15 countries 
have the opportunity to participate in 
training workshops, knowledge-sharing 
spaces, and challenges associated with 
the implementation of sustainability 
programs. In addition, LATAM has a 
recognition plan for training courses and 
participation in high-value activities 
associated with the strategy.

Commitment to the future 57Solidary Plane 
programThe program operates in three fields 
of action: it supports health needs, 
promotes the preservations of natural 
resources, and provides assistance 
in the face of natural disasters. It is 
enhanced through agreements and 
alliances with different organizations, 
foundations, and government agencies. 
During 2021, with the aim of generating 
a stronger support structure, focused 
on deep and long-term changes, new 
strategic alliances were formed.
In the case of Brazil, in addition to the new 
alliances established in 2021 within the 
Avion Solidario program, LATAM supports 
the work of other non-governmental 
organizations: Amigos do Bem, Ampara 
Animal, Alto Arapiuns, Associação 
Caatinga, Embaixadores da Educação, 
FAS, Gastromotiva, Gerando Falcões, 
Instituto Mara Gabrilli, Instituto Tênis, Junior 
Achievement, Make a Wish, Marcos Rossi, 
Rodrigo Mendes, and SOS Bosque Atlántico. 
In addition, since 2018, through an 
agreement with the Brazilian Civil 
House, LATAM has provided courtesy 
tickets for the transportation of 
Venezuelan refugees within the country. 
Also, since 2000, it provides support for 
the transport of organs for transplants; 
in 2013, an agreement was signed 
with the Ministry of Health for the free 
transfer of organs, tissues, and bone 
marrow in national territory.Health Environment Disaster

operations, for the free distribution 
of COVID-19 vaccines nationwide. 
The group's experience in the 
pharmaceutical transport business 
through its cargo subsidiaries, and the 
corresponding certifications in the field, 
were key for regional governments 
to entrust to LATAM the efforts of 
transporting vaccines.
In 2021, nearly 208 million vaccines 
were transported in Brazil, Chile, 
Ecuador, and Peru. LATAM Airlines 
Brazil transported nearly 180 million 
vaccines free of charge, representing 
61% of the total airborne doses in the 
country; in Peru, they totaled more 
than 26 million doses, representing 9 
out of every 10 vaccines distributed 
internally in the country. 
Beyond its contribution to combating 
the pandemic, Avion Solidario's work 
on health had other outstanding 
milestones. Examples are given below.• In Chile and Brazil, the subsidiaries 
transported 911 organs and tissues 
and carried out 65 stem cell transfers. 
• Galapagos Oncology Unit: LATAM Airlines 
Ecuador collaborated in the transfer of 
Solca's cargo and medical personnel for 
the inauguration of this hospital that 
offers gynecological health care focused 
on the prevention and detection of 
cervical and breast cancers in Ecuador.
• Support for the “Rodamos por 
una Sonrisa” (We roll for a smile) 
campaign in Colombia, which recorded 
the crossing of six cyclists from 
Bogota to Riohacha (more than 
1,000 kilometers) in order to raise 
funds for the medical organization 
Operación Sonrisa. LATAM Airlines 
Colombia is a historical ally of that 
foundation, which offers specialized 
care to children with cleft palate. 
Since the beginning of this alliance 
in 2009 in Peru and in 2012 in 
Colombia, LATAM transports the 
team of doctors and volunteers for 
the days of assessment, surgery, 
and rehabilitation that have enabled 
surgical intervention in more than 6 
thousand children in both countries.Environment
In terms of the environment, LATAM 
transported 195 tons of recyclable 
materials from island territories, as a 
way of collaborating with the challenge 
of reverse logistics and the proper 
management of waste. In 2021, the 
Galapagos Islands in Ecuador joined 
Easter Island in Chile and San Andrés in 
Colombia, pioneers in the matter.
In addition, LATAM has established 
alliances with organizations related to 
the care of endangered species and 
together they achieved 192 transfers. 
Disasters
The Avion Solidario was activated to 
support more than 165 flood-affected 
municipalities in southern Bahia in Brazil 
and transported basic food, drinking 
water, and toiletries and sanitation for 
3,800 people and 2,000 animals, in 
conjunction with the Brazilian Red Cross 
and other civil society organizations. 
The program also supported care to 
those affected by the earthquake 
in Peru. 2.3 tons of staple items 
were transferred to Piura in alliance 
with Hombro a Hombro (shoulder-
to-shoulder), an organization that 
coordinates private business efforts for 
natural disaster prevention and care.Snapshot

In October 2021, Roberto Alvo, CEO of 
LATAM Airlines Group S.A., participated 
in the 77th Annual General Meeting 
of the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA), in which a resolution 
was adopted whereby the air industry 
commits to achieve zero net CO2 
emissions by 2050, meaning that a total 
of 21.2 tons of carbon will be reduced 
by that year. 
To fulfill this commitment, and 
aligned with the objective of the Paris 
Agreement, the industry is working on 
solutions, such as sustainable aviation 
fuels, technology and innovation, more 
efficient operations and infrastructure, 
and will rely on measures such as carbon 
capture and storage, and compensation 
schemes such as CORSIA.
CORSIA is the Compensation and Carbon 
Reduction Scheme in International 
Aviation through which the aviation 
industry regulates the greenhouse gas 
emissions of international civil aviation. 
CORSIA will contribute to stabilizing net 
emissions from international aviation at 
2019 levels in the short and medium term.These commitments are the result of a 
cross-sectional assessment process that 
seeks to meet the target of the Paris 
Agreement of limiting the temperature 
increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
They are aligned with the air 
industry's strategy and commitment 
to climate change.
Likewise, as a sign of the commitment 
to a carbon neutral LATAM in 2050, 
70 A320neo-family aircraft were 
integrated, which incorporate the latest 
technologies providing 20% more fuel 
efficiency, and thus, lower emissions of 
CO2, combined with a 50% reduction 
in nitrogen oxide emissions and a 50% 
reduction in the acoustic footprint.INDUSTRY

In climate change management, LATAM 
has set challenging targets for itself. As 
part of the launch of its sustainability 
strategy in May 2021, it announced its 
commitment to achieve carbon neutral 
growth taking 2019 as its base year, 
offset the equivalent of 50% of its 
domestic emissions by 2030, and be 
carbon neutral by 2050. 
Integrated Report 2021
Commitment to the future 60In the materialization of this strategy, 
it is worth noting the alliance of LATAM 
Group with CO2BIO, a project located in 
the Colombian Orinoco region spanning 
over 200 thousand hectares and seeking 
to protect the flooded savanna, one of the 
most threatened and underrepresented 
ecosystems in the country. This project has 
been promoted by Fundación Cataruben, 
with the support of the Natural Wealth 
Program of the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID) and 
Panthera Colombia. Through conservation 
and rehabilitation actions, this initiative will capture 1 million tons of CO2 during the 
2021–2023 period, and has the potential 
to capture up to 2.8 million additional 
tons by 2025. These projections are 
updated according to the progress on the 
certification of new phases. 
As part of the joint work on climate 
change management, during 2021, 
LATAM also developed the first phase 
of a collaboration with The Nature 
Conservancy (TNC) to plan conservation 
and reforestation actions in iconic 
ecosystems in the region.1 TNC in Latin Amer -

of projects that generate these credits.
To ensure that projects meet the 
highest standards and, in addition to 
carbon dioxide capture, have social, 
environmental, and economic co-
benefits for communities, LATAM 
evaluates each initiative under a set of 
sustainability criteria prior to selection. 
This evaluation prioritizes those projects 
that contribute to the conservation and 
protection of biodiversity.OFFSETTING EMISSIONS
Latin America is home to six of the 10

with high environmental value, 
capacity to absorb large amounts 
of CO2, and which are the habitat of 
different species. These ecosystems are 
seriously threatened and collaborative 
work between communities, NGOs, 
and the private sector promotes their 
protection to prevent the release of 
CO2 into the atmosphere.1.  By burning 
fossil fuels, 
carbon dioxide 
is released into 
the atmosphere, 
which contributes 
to climate change.

In addition to the alliance with major 
NGOs, associations, and authorities, 
LATAM developed the Fly Neutral program, 
which gives its corporate clients the 
opportunity to choose from a portfolio 
of high environmental value projects to 
offset the emissions generated in their 
air travel. As part of the proposal and 
commitment to conservation, LATAM 
Airlines matches the amount of tons 
offset by its corporate clients, through the 
1+1 mechanism.
In the first phase of the Fly Neutral 
program, the passengers of the 
corporate segment (LATAM Corporate) 
can find out the carbon footprint of 
their itinerary and compensate through 
a portfolio of projects that seek to 
stop deforestation in strategic areas, 
conserve biodiversity, and strengthen 
capacities in communities.
In turn, LATAM cargo developed its 
carbon emissions calculator and 
established the structure that will 
enable it to collaborate with cargo 
clients in offsetting their shipments.

Civil Aeronautics Board and the 
Energy Sustainability Agency seeking, 
under a collaborative public-private 
approach, to improve the energy and 
environmental management of the air 
industry, identifying and implementing 
opportunities to reduce fuel 
consumption. Together with this, it will 
foster the use of cleaner technologies, 
such as sustainable aviation fuels. Selected projects 
In 2021, LATAM Airlines Colombia 
offset 334,144 tons of carbon dioxide

environmental, social and economic 
co-benefits for communities, such 
as in the case of Carmen del Darien

LATAM has developed a number of 
actions that seek responsible fuel 
use. Initiatives focused on reducing 
consumption and operating efficiency to 
optimize its savings. In addition to fleet 
modernization, it has a fuel-efficient 
program, with more than 10 years of 
history, called LATAM Fuel Efficiency.
From 2012 to 2021, the group increased 
aviation fuel efficiency by 5.3% through 
the program. In 2020, the results 
were impacted by some pandemic 
procedures, such as increased use of 
the auxiliary engine (APU) on land and 
use of air conditioning throughout the 
landing to renew the cabin air. In 2021, 
gross savings totaled 8,314,052 gallons 
(1,090 TJ of energy), equivalent to 
US$24.5 million. The work has a positive 
impact on reducing the carbon footprint 
and also on reducing costs. 302-4
In search of a more efficient technology 
and operation, in 2018, LATAM 
implemented a pilot application that 
allows continuous monitoring of 
their flight performance according to 
the initiatives. At the beginning of 
2021, it was clear that the impact generated is equivalent to a reduction 
in consumption of approximately one 
million gallons per year.
In addition, in 2021, it proposed 
to upgrade its A320-family fleet 
with the Airbus Descent Profile 
Optimization (DPO) feature, a fuel-
saving enhancement to the aircraft's 
flight management system (FMS) 
performance database. 
The group remained focused on 
improving ground and air operating 
procedures and fleet optimization and 
rejuvenation with the addition of new 
Airbus A320neo aircraft. These aircraft 
use more efficient engines, with 15% 
lower consumption, 8% lower operating 
cost, 50% lower emissions of nitrogen 
oxides (NOx), and lower acoustic 
impact than the previous version, A320, 
according to manufacturer data.

Instead of a linear system (extraction 
>> production >> consumption) that 
ends with end-of-life discarding, it is 
working to ensure that the materials 
used in the operation are sustainable 
and that, after their use, rather than 
becoming waste, they are reintegrated 
into another production cycle as raw 
material for new products.
LATAM carried out an evaluation of its 
waste management whose goal was, 
among others, to identify the materials 
that generate significant impacts on 
the environment in order to define 
actions focused on their disposal, such 
as single-use plastics, which are widely 
used in the aviation industry.
This diagnostic process began in 2021 
and focused on the areas with the 
highest generation of waste such as 
Airport, Maintenance, In-flight Service, 
and Cargo. The results of this evaluation 
will support the definition of strategies 
to achieve the goals that LATAM has set 
out in circular economics.WASTE BY

single-use plastics by 2023 and 
to be a zero-landfill waste group 
by 2027 . To achieve these goals, and 
in order to boost the circular economy 
within its processes, in 2021, it 
developed a detailed evaluation of its 
waste management, including analysis 
from the materiality of the inputs it 
employs in its operation. According to the results of the diagnosis, 
plastic generation is one of the critical 
elements in In-flight Service, and since 
this macroprocess has the greatest 
weight in the group's waste matrix, in 
line with the goals defined by LATAM, 
the single-use plastic disposal will be 
prioritized by 2022, which will allow us to 
reach 2023 with its full elimination.
The life cycle assessment that began in 
2021 will be essential to feed the group's 
circular economy strategy, and in 2022, 
LATAM will continue to strengthen this 
process with the implementation of a 
waste follow-up and monitoring system.Waste diagnosis 
A diagnosis of LATAM’s waste generation 
was developed in 2021 from an 
assessment of representative samples. 
The main waste-generating processes 
and main bases of the operation 
were taken and, extrapolating to the 
conditions of the pre-COVID operation 
(base year 2019), it was identified that 
LATAM generated about 11 thousand 
tons of solid waste.

Commitment to the future 66WASTE MANAGEMENT 
Rethinking processes
In 2021, LATAM defined a structure 
focused on migrating to the circular 
economy model in which, in addition to 
moving forward with process evaluation, 
it considers a line of action to rethink and 
redesign processes and products that 
guarantee a more sustainable experience 
for passengers. In this development, one 
of the most significant results was the 
redesign of LATAM's amenity kits and the 
gradual change of materials.
The amenity kits , which are initially 
available on the Santiago de Chile - 
Madrid and Sao Paulo - Miami routes, 
contain local items that generate 
less impact on the planet: bamboo 
toothbrushes with caps made of sugar cane, reusable eye masks and socks, 
and vegan and cruelty-free  products 
made by Brazilian craftswomen. In 
addition, with the aim of showcasing the 
artistic and cultural wealth of our region, 
the kits are delivered in a reusable and 
collectable bag designed by South 
American artists. Gradually, they will be 
implemented on other routes.
Paperless
LATAM continues to advance in the 
implementation of digital processes that 
allow it to be more efficient, provide 
better service, and reduce the impact 
on the environment. This is the case 
with the elimination of magazines on its 
aircraft where, through digitization, in 
addition to avoiding the consumption of 
paper as a resource and the generation of waste, it further significantly 
contributes to reduce emissions as a 
result of lower fuel consumption.
In-flight service
In order to optimize the amount of 
food that is loaded on each flight and 
reduce waste linked to the In-flight 
Service, LATAM has an automated 
food ordering system that allows 
catering service providers to load only 
the amount of food required, based 
on confirmed booking passengers. 
This service is implemented on 
international flights.
In addition, in coordination with catering 
providers, measures are implemented 
to take advantage of some elements on 
board. Based on their characteristics, 
Waste and the air industryInformation on the volumes of waste 
generated in the air industry is limited. 
According to an IATA study, conducted 
at Heathrow Airport in London, England, 
in 2012 and 2013 a typical passenger 
generated 1.43 kilos of cabin garbage 
per flight. This is an average that includes 
short- and long-haul international flights 
from different airlines.
In the industry, they recognize the 
importance of reducing, recycling, and 
reusing cabin waste from their aircraft. However, actions to control pollution are 
subject to each country, which in turn have 
sanitary measures that inhibit them with 
the aim to protect local agriculture, in many 
cases requiring waste to be incinerated or 
buried instead of reused or recycled.
According to information published 
by IATA, cabin waste could double in 
the next 10 years, should the industry 
continue without intelligent regulation. 
That is why it is important to simplify 
and harmonize cabin waste management and to promote technical solutions that 
reduce industry costs and contribute to 
the circular economy. IATA is sharing 
best practices with its airlines, catering  
companies, airports, and regulators, 
and commissioned a study proposing 
the adoption of regulation that allows 
waste to be reused and recycled while 
maintaining animal health controls. those that are not opened or delivered 
may be loaded on another flight.
Aeronautical material
In the reconfiguration and modernization 
of LATAM's fleet, aeronautical materials 
and elements are removed: seats,  
galleys , floor mats, among others. To 
ensure their proper management and 
in accordance with current regulations, 
LATAM takes advantage of them so that 
they can be reused in the operation or 
in other companies. For example, in the 
case of seats, a campaign was triggered 
to enable employees to purchase 
and use them in their homes. Last, 
for materials that cannot be reused, 
agreements were made with recycling 
providers to ensure that waste from 
these materials does not reach landfills.

recycled in 2021.
Uniform recycling
An initiative that was born in Peru in 
2018 and allows LATAM to take over 
and give a second life to the discarded 
uniforms. This program not only 
minimizes the impact on the environment 
with the conversion of textile waste, but 
also creates the possibility of building 
a more sustainable community through 
partnerships, employment generation, 
and the encouragement of responsible

Pilot in Colombia 
In partnership with the World Women's 
Corporation, the “Colombia, an Ancestral 
Journey” collection was launched, using 
the textile waste of the uniforms of 
the crew and agents to manufacture 
new products required by different 
areas across the group. The pieces have 
artisan participations from communities 
representing the country: Emberas, 
Kunas, Wayuu and Zenus.Recycle Your Trip
Through the Recycle Your Trip program, 
LATAM mobilizes passengers and 
catering providers toward recycling 
waste generated on board by 
passengers on domestic flights.  The 
process begins when the crew collect 
the waste in the LATAM trolley and 
segregate it between aluminum (cans), 
glass (spirits and juices), and plastics 
(bottles and cups). Once the aircraft 
has landed, the material is separated 
and delivered to the catering provider, 
who sees that it is transferred to 
different recycling centers.
Launched in Chile in 2019, the program 
was suspended in 2020 because of the 
pandemic and resumed in May 2021. 
Since then, it has progressively spread 
to other subsidiaries, reaching Ecuador 
in September. Implementation in Peru, 
Colombia, and Brazil is planned for the 
first half of 2022 because in-flight 
services are not yet permitted as a 
result of the pandemic.LATAM performance
Total waste generated in 2021, 
according to on-site generation 
including hazardous liquid waste, was 
28.8 thousand tons, an increase of 338 
per cent over the previous year. About 
3.9% of that total was sent for recycling. 
This increase is mainly due to the 
reactivation of operations.

Commitment to the future 69Environmental management  
                       and eco-efficiency
To fulfill the commitments made as 
part of its sustainability strategy, 
and within the framework of 
environmental management, LATAM 
Airlines Group S .A. implemented a 
transparent and auditable system that 
allows it to keep environmental variables 
in mind in all the processes of the group, 
and that has environmental certification 
(IEnvA) across the operation. 
IEnvA is IATA's environmental assessment 
program for the aviation sector and is 
designed to independently assess and 
improve the environmental management 
of an airline. Membership is voluntary and 
involves two stages: the first one includes 
the environmental management system, 
the commitment of senior management, 
and the mapping of relevant legal-
environmental requirements and of 
environmental aspects and impacts of 
activities; the second, more advanced 
stage includes the definition of goals, 
audits, operating programs and controls, 
and the training of teams.More information:
Sustainability policySince 2020, three operations had 
already been certified: LATAM cargo 
in Miami, United States under ISO 
14001/2015, LATAM Airlines Colombia, 
and Chile, under IEnvA stage 1 and 2, 
respectively. During 2021, certification 
was achieved for the group’s 9 carriers, 
both in cargo and in passengers, under 
stage 1, and IEnvA stage 2 certification 
is expected to be achieved across the 
company during 2022.
As part of the evolution of its 
environmental management system, 
LATAM renewed its Safety, Quality, 
and Environment Policy to more 
specifically include the guidelines 
linked to environmental management 
and the control of the organization's 
environmental impacts.

Discussions on topics such as 
leadership, sustainability, diversity and 
inclusion, among others, were added 
to the regular agenda of dialogs. The 
meetings, led by the Vice President of 
Human Resources and leaders from 
different areas of the group, were open 
to all stakeholders, leading to a more 
complete view of how these subjects 
are perceived and how LATAM is 
expected to address them. 
On parallel, the internal leadership 
index was adjusted with the inclusion 
of variables to measure group progress 
toward its objectives of simplicity and 
transparency, as well as compliance 
with expected timely feedback  practices, 
team meetings, 1 to 1 meetings, and a 
culture of recognition of good actions, 
among others. In addition, there is a 
measurement from the team itself 
toward their superiors, which makes 
it possible to extract a 360° view of 
the leader's performance, which has 
the fundamental role of driving overall 
development.ONGOING

this process, internal dialog forums 
were expanded and work on cultural 
transformation intensified.Growth and development
Throughout the year, more than 665 
thousand hours of training were 
carried out, divided into more than one 
thousand updated and 500 new courses, 
representing a total investment of  
US$11.6 million. Average training hours 
per employee reached 36.3 hours, an 
increase of 21% compared to 2020.
This type of initiative opens up spaces 
for teams’ professional growth. In 
2021, more than 2 thousand individuals 
were promoted, 3.2 thousand changed 
responsibilities, and more than 50% of 
the positions generated in the year were 
occupied by internal personnel. 
The turnover rate was 22.5%, down 
from 53.7% in 2020, when the largest 
adjustments in the operation occurred 
in response to the global crisis resulting 
from the pandemic.

For LATAM Airlines Group, occupational 
health and safety management is a 
process of ongoing improvement, which 
considers stages of identification, 
prevention and mitigation of risks in the 
various environments and operations, 
internal performance monitoring, and 
identification of good practices.
Actions taken in 2021 to ensure a safe 
work environment include:
• Occupational safety work plan:  
focused on inspections of critical 
hazards, such as work at height, 
confined spaces, or mobile 
equipment;
• Inspection Plan: implemented 
in Brazil for personal protective 
equipment and lifelines for 
maintenance activities;
• Work safety plan in the cargo 
network:  more than 20 actions 
focused on four pillars: infrastructure, 
procedures, culture, and risk 
management;• Safety Practice Index (SPI):  
implemented for cargo operations at 
the Santiago and Miami airports; and
• Management Dashboards: an 
accident-free day dashboard and 
a proactive occupational safety 
indicator panel is implemented in 
Cargo.
Performance on the monitored 
indicators was positive, maintaining 
good results in 2020. The API (Action 
Plan Index), which manages the 
effectiveness of potential risk mitigation 
plans (all identified and different 
severity levels) remained stable at 94%,  
and the injury rate was 0.48.Snapshot

The client is at the center of 
LATAM's work, and the group 
works to provide the most options 
to suit their needs, such as different 
kinds of fares and services that can 
be purchased as a complement. 
The commitment to deliver the best 
experience at all stages of interaction 
– purchase, airport, after-sales, and 
on board – also involves the use of 
technology. As a result of a digital 
transformation initiated by LATAM three 
years ago, clients can manage the main 
services with just one click.
In 2021, the group reviewed all 
instances related to the customer 
experience searching for opportunities 
to apply new technologies that provide 
agility, facilitate access, and lead to 
greater satisfaction, which was achieved 
through collaborative work between 
different areas of the business. For 
LATAM, technology is part of the way of 
working, the business, and its constant 
transformations.SOME DIGITAL 
SOLUTIONS
• LATAM App:  
Flight information, 
date change, seat 
selection, use of 
augmented reality 
to verify that the 
carry-on baggage 
meets the boarding 
requirements
• Automatic check-in 
(for domestic flights) 
and digital self-
check-in at kiosks or 
via the App
• Self bag drop  
(available at 20 
airports in eight 
countries) and digital 
payment in case of 
excess baggage
• Wi-Fi connectivity:  
Available on domestic 
flights in Brazil 
(narrow body fleet )
• LATAM Play:  
LATAM's in-flight 
entertainment 
platform was 
expanded in 2021 
through an exclusive 
agreement with HBO 
Max to offer films and 
series to passengers
Digital tools 
halved the 
rate of contact 
center calls per

The early check-in 
process (automatic or 
kiosk) reduced assisted 
check-in by 36% 
throughout the year. 
In the last quarter of 
2021, only 10% of clients 
checked in at the physical 
counter, as 90% managed 
to receive their boarding 
pass automatically.
Integrated Report 2021
Clients 78LATAM Wallet
LATAM Wallet is an electronic wallet 
that provides more proximity and 
transparency to the processing of 
refunds or ticket exchanges because 
it allows clients to maintain balances 
of money to be used with the airline; 
in addition, it provides the ability 
to serve clients who do not have 
electronic means of payment through 
digital platforms.
Data Intelligence
LATAM applies advanced analytics 
and machine learning  tools to gain 
insight into its operation and clients to 
generate benefits and improvements 
in both the user experience and 
daily operational processes.  
Fraud prevention, aircraft fueling 
optimization and flight experience 
customization are some of the 
improvements that can be achieved.REAL TIME 
INFORMATION
Each crew has a 
smartphone that 
allows them to 
perform from 
technical handling 
to understanding 
who the 
passenger is 
in-flight, trying 
to move toward 
customizing the 
travel experience.Custom campaigns
LATAM also applies technologies in 
digital marketing to generate customized 
campaigns using machine learning 
models with important results, such as:
• Reduced digital advertising costs by 
USD$2.5 million
• USD$1.5 million increase in revenue 
per campaign
• Reduced campaign creation time from 
1 week to a matter of hours 
From the data center to the cloud
Throughout the year, the group moved 
forward with the transfer of applications 
to the cloud, a project that began in 
2017 and is expected to be completed 
in 2023. The goal is to simplify the 
ecosystem of technology platforms 
and consolidate applications for a much 
simpler and more robust infrastructure.
LATAM Airlines is the region's first Google 
Cloud partner, enabling it to work with 
service startups, support local economies 
differently, and better respond to 
services that operate from those 
platforms. In addition, migration to the 
cloud reduces greenhouse gas emissions.New alliances
LATAM cargo has experienced the 
same reality, which implemented in the 
international business an online  portal 
that allows clients to self-manage 
their cargo in a simple and agile way 
and have full visibility of the entire 
logistic process of their shipment. It 
is estimated that, in 2022, it will be 
enabled for domestic markets.
In this context, the group also formed 
alliances with two marketplaces: 
Webcargo and cargo.one, becoming 
the region's first air cargo carrier to 
decentralize its distribution channels. 
Thus, starting in the second quarter 
of 2022, it will be possible to book 
on LATAM cargo to and within South 
America from Europe and North America 
instantly with a few clicks on cargo.one.
It is all about offering clients more 
alternatives so they can schedule their 
shipments through LATAM cargo in 
the way they feel most comfortable, 
diversifying distribution channels and 
offering the best direct booking options.As part of its data management 
policy, LATAM adheres to the strictest 
regulations such as the European or 
Brazilian one, complying with the various 
regulations known as the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The main technological risks, security 
incidents, and the progress of the 
strategic cybersecurity plan are 
periodically presented to the Board and 
the Directors’ Committee by the Group's 
Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief 
Technology Officer (CTO), and Chief 
Information Security Officer (CISO). 
Senior management continuously 
supports the cybersecurity program by 
facilitating funding and the appropriate 
organizational structure for its 
compliance and implementation.
As in previous years, there were no cases 
of consumer data violations in 2021.
Integrated Report 2021
Clients 79Customer service
Pandemic constraints resulted in an 
extra challenge in providing information 
to clients. To meet the growing demand 
for customer services, LATAM quickly 
implemented a new support tool that 
simplifies access to information when 
answering calls. With clients in mind, 
new channels were also launched:
By moving forward with the cabin 
transformation project, which will reach 
the entire narrow body  fleet by 2023 
and the wide body  fleet by 2025, LATAM 
responds to the needs and expectations 
of different customer segments. The 
retrofits aim to improve the experience of 
passengers who require greater comfort, 
particularly on long-haul flights, and to 
offer a product with competitive fares.
In 2021, the project allowed the launch of the premium economy domestic fare: 
the front row seats have more room 
between them, and passengers have 
exclusive areas to store carry-on baggage, 
larger individual screens, and preferential 
boarding. The back of the plane is destined 
to optimize the cost-benefit ratio for 
passengers seeking lower prices.
By the end of 2021, the new cabins were 
available on 117 aircraft and an additional 
50 aircraft are expected by 2022.One cabin, different sections• WhatsApp: Provides up-to-date flight 
information and even when to board.
• Website : A Restrictions Information 
section was created, which gathers 
the updated rules for flying in each 
country where the group operates.LATAM Pass
The group operates the LATAM Pass 
Frequent Flyer program, with 39 
million members. Accrued points can 
be exchanged for airplane tickets or 
other services, which vary by category, 
such as cabin upgrades and baggage 
allowance. 102-2LATAM Corporate Partner
At the end of 2021, LATAM launched 
the LATAM Corporate Partner program, 
focused on corporate customers. Each 
company enrolled in the program is 
assigned one of four categories – Classic, 
Superior, Plus, and Elite – each of which 
considers different benefit packages 
ranging from the economic ones, such 
as discounts or the accumulation of 
miles on business trips. To  facilities like 
prioritization at the airport.
Integrated Report 2021

OAG, a global benchmark in information 
and analytics for the airline industry. 
Satisfaction
Systematically , LATAM measures clients’ 
levels of perception about the operation 
and service through the Net Promoter 
Score  (NPS), which enables it to 
understand strengths, weaknesses, and 
generate improvements in its processes 
with clients in mind.

maintained the upward trend of recent 
years and reached 49 points, 9 more 
than in 2020 and a cumulative increase 
of 16 points since 2019. 3% of the 
passengers answered the survey.
The growth in NPS is due to the 
increase in punctuality rates in recent years and improvements in service, 
with the implementation of the new 
cabin configurations, the new Premium 
Economy cabin on domestic flights 
and, in 2021, the return of the in-flight 
service on flights in Chile and Ecuador.  
Clients also evaluated LATAM on issues 
of safety and the teams’ friendliness. 
The NPS of the digital experience 
reached 46 points.
The NPS indicator for LATAM Cargo and 
its cargo subsidiaries was 30 points, 
up 12 points from 2020. This is mainly 
explained by clients' assessment of 
LATAM's role in fulfilling and maintaining 
operational continuity despite the 
difficulties of the health crisis.Snapshot

Suppliers 82Supply  
   chain
More than 8 thousand suppliers  
make up the network of 
partners of the LATAM group, 
with a total volume of acquisitions of 
around US$4.60 billion in 2021. Most of 
them are concentrated in B razil (44%) 
and Chile (15%).
The group maintains a close relationship 
with its suppliers, with transparency, 
commitment, and the search for joint 
evolution as the essential pillars. Active 
communication with them was essential 
to be able to circumvent the onslaught 
of the pandemic.
The year 2021 was marked by the 
operational recovery of the markets, 
where the collaboration that has been 
carried out with suppliers to anticipate 
demand and deliver to passengers took 
the spotlight. Communication with 
suppliers has also been very important 
to maintain pre-pandemic service 
levels and ensure the good business 
relationship while LATAM develops its 
financial reorganization plan.It is important to note that the main 
suppliers are partners in LATAM's 
strategy to be more sustainable and 
implement measures for recycling and 
purchasing compostable products.
Supplier management follows guidelines 
on quality and regularity of supply, 
competitive prices, legal compliance,

and good social and environmental 
practices. Contracting is governed by the 
Corporate Procurement Policy, which is 
aligned with the group's Anti-Corruption 
Policy and establishes financial, social, 
and environmental requirements for 
partners. In addition, all contracts have 
a specific clause requiring the reporting 
of environmental incidents or damage.

Thanks to the joint work with 
suppliers, the group has been able to 
make progress in sustainability, as 
happened with the Recycle Your Trip in 
Chile and Ecuador.
In the case of Chile, the elements 
segregated on board finish their 
recycling process in the units of the 
catering provider, who removes the 
waste and deposits it at the clean points 
available in their facilities. Likewise, in 
Ecuador, it is the cleaning staff who 
collect the already segregated waste 
and transfer it to the airport recycling 
point. This is how the joint work 
between the group and the partners has 
allowed not only the fulfillment of this 
program, but has also taught them how 
to segregate the elements so that they 
can indeed be recycled–achievements 
that, without doubt, are the result of a 
shared commitment to sustainability.
Moreover, in 2021, progress was made 
on the design and development of the 
new materials to be used on board – in 
order to meet the goal of eliminating 
single-use plastics by the end of 2023 
– by projecting their implementation 
during 2022. The measures worked on 
aim for the removal of bags from rest 
elements, glasses, cutlery, and lids, 
among other materials.At the same time, the group is 
exploring new recycling initiatives 
that contribute to meeting the target 
of zero landfill waste by 2027 . This 
is the case of a project that seeks 
to reuse materials and/or items that 
are no longer used after the cabin 
renovation. As an example, we should 
mention the reutilization of seats in 
the fleet to build LATAM furniture, 
their donation for educational 
projects and/or for the benefit of 
communities, or their reintegration 
into the production chain, turning 
them into resources instead of waste.
And, in order to continuously improve 
management with suppliers, the 
group is developing a strategy to learn 
firsthand what shortcomings they may 
have, considering as a first step the 
implementation of a survey in the first 
quarter of 2022.

Integrated Report 2021
About the Report 86Methodology  
      and materialityThe contents and indicators linked 
to the GRI standards were subjected 
to external verification by Deloitte 
(see page 96). PwC audited the 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
of LATAM and its affiliates (see page 
169), which include the consolidated 
financial statements as at December 
31, 2020 and 2021, available starting 
on page 168. 102-56
The content selection took into 
account the coverage of the topics 
considered to be the most relevant 
to the group and its stakeholders, 
based on the definition of materiality 
process concluded in 2018. This 
process analyzed the main economic, 
environmental, and social impacts of 
the business and the expectations of 
the main LATAM stakeholders.
About 2,400 responses from 
employees, clients, and suppliers to 
an online  survey, and the sustainability 
issues that are part of the investor 
and shareholder policies and 
publications of the group1, various 
regulatory authorities2, air industry 
representatives3, civil society 
organizations4, and sustainability 
benchmarks5  were taken into account. 
Press news on LATAM in 2017 was also 
analyzed. 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-46Next, top management prioritized 
the most relevant issues considering 
the degree of relevance and impact. 
The consolidated vision of external 
audiences and group leaders was 
validated by the CEO.

Where does the impact occur? Organization involvement
Health and safety in the air and on the groundThe impact is seen inside the organization, mainly affecting the aircraft, 
airports, and other operational facilities.LATAM determines different levels of management according to the type of event. 
There is a dedicated team that prepares the organization to manage emergencies on an 
ongoing basis.
Ethics and anti-corruptionThe impact is seen inside the organization, affecting all employees and third 
parties, as well as the overall society.LATAM has implemented a wide-ranging compliance program to manage impacts and 
minimize risks.
On-time performanceThe impact is on LATAM’s main activity; that is, the flights it operates, affecting 
passenger perceptions and the business as a whole. LATAM can manage a significant portion of the impacts, such as delays due to 
maintenance, air crew management,  and others. Some impacts are external to the 
organization, such as weather conditions, air traffic limitations and congestion at airports.
Economic and financial sustainabilityThe main impact is seen inside LATAM, and it can affect the brand, the loyalty 
program, the implementation of the business strategy, commercial relations, 
and others.LATAM can adjust or restructure its strategy, even if most of the factors are beyond its 
control. The group has a policy to manage and mitigate financial  risks.
Developing employeesThe impact is throughout LATAM’s operations. Human resources management 
is directly linked with corporate performance.LATAM manages employee talent and fosters commitment to corporate strategy.
Mitigating climate changeThe main impact is on the environment and comes mainly from the use of fuel, 
which contributes to overall greenhouse gas emissions and, to a lesser extent, 
to the worsening of local air quality.The impact is the result of the group's operations, which is the reason why LATAM 
has a strategy for monitoring and managing climate change. Moreover, the group is 
attentive to opportunities to incorporate new technologies and best practices that 
influence this issue.
Customer focusThe impact occurs inside LATAM and with its clients, affecting market share and 
customer spending on the group.LATAM plays a key role in managing this impact, mainly with regard to its capacity to 
anticipate existing risks. 
Destination networkThe development and growth of the destination network benefits the cities 
served, generating economic development through the reduced cost of doing 
business and transporting cargo, as well as increasing tourism.LATAM plays a key role in managing and monitoring the factors that may influence 
this issue.
Relations with authoritiesThe impact from a change in the regulatory environment is seen inside the 
organization, affecting all the operations, and outside the organization, affecting 
the sector as a whole.LATAM’s  role is to identify and monitor how decisions by public authorities may affect 
the development of the group and the airline industry, as well as connectivity in a 
country or region, and clients.
Sustainable tourism The impact is on the destinations served by LATAM.The capacity to manage this issue varies in accordance with LATAM’s share in the 
total passenger traffic to a given location. The group strives to play an active role in 
promoting a balance between tourism and the preservation of the local culture and 
environment.

INDEPENDENT REVISION REPORT OF LATAM  
INTEGRATED REPORT 2021   
Mr. Juan José Toha 
Director de Asuntos Corporativos y Sostenibilidad 
Latam Airlines Group 
 
Of our consideration: 
 
We have reviewed the following aspects of the LATAM Integrated 
Report 2021: 
Scope  
Limited assurance engagement of the adherence of the contents and 
indicators included in the 2021 Integrated Report to the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) Standards, regarding the organization’s profile and material 
indicators arising from the materiality process that the Company 
carried out following said Standards related to the economic, social, and 
environmental dimensions. 
Standards and Assurance Process 
We have carried out our task in accordance with the guidelines of the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements Other than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000) issued by 
the International Auditing and Assurance Standard Board (IAASB) of 
the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). 
Our review has consisted in an inquiry process involving different LATAM 
units and management areas, involved in the process of developing the Report, as well as in the application of analytic procedures and 
verification tests, which are described in the following items:  
√ Meeting with Sustainability management. 
√ Requirements and review of evidence with the areas participating in 
the preparation of the 2021 Integrated Report. 
√ Analysis of the adherence of the contents of the 2021 Integrated 
Report to the GRI Standards: Core option, and review of the indicators 
included in the report in order to verify that they are aligned with the 
protocols established in the Standards, and whether the fact that 
some indicators are not applicable or not material is justified. 
√ Verification, through tests of quantitative and qualitative information 
corresponding to the GRI Standards indicators included in the 2021 
Report, and its adequate gathering from the data provided by LATAM 
information sources. 
 
Conclusions  
√   The assurance process was based on the indicators established in the 
materiality process carried out by LATAM. Once those indicators were 
identified, prioritized, and validated, they were included in the report. The 
reported and verified indicators appear in the following table : 
 
102-1 102-2 102-3 102-4 102-5 102-6 102-7 102-8 102-9 102-10 
102-11 102-12 102-13 102-14 102-15 102-16 102-17 102-18 102-40 102-41 
102-42 102-43 102-44 102-45 102-46 102-47 102-48 102-49 102-50 102-51 
102-52 102-53 102-54 102-55 102-56 103-1 103-2 103-3 201-2 203-1 
203-2 205-2 205-3 206-1 302-1 302-3 302-4 303-3 305-1 305-2 
305-3 305-4 305-5 305-6 305-7 306-3 306-4 306-5 401-1 404-1 
403-7 403-9 415-1 417-3 419-1      
 
√  Regarding the verified indicators, we can say that no aspect has arisen 
to lead us to believe that the Integrated Report 2021 LATAM has not 
been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards in those areas 
identified in the scope. Improvement Opportunities Report 
In addition to this letter, Deloitte is presenting to LATAM a 
special report including improvement opportunities to reinforce 
management aspects, and the Company's ability to draft future 
Integrated Reports. 
LATAM Management and Deloitte Responsibilities 
The drafting of the 2021 Integrated Report, as well as its contents 
are under LATAM responsibility, which is in charge of the definition, 
adaptation, and maintenance of the management and internal 
control systems from who the information is obtained. 
Our responsibility is to issue an independent report based on the 
procedures applied in our review. 
This report has been prepared exclusively by LATAM's request, in 
accordance with the terms established in the Engagement Letter. 
We have developed our work according to the standards of 
Independence established in the Code of Ethics of the IFAC. 
The conclusions of the verification made by Deloitte apply to the latest 
version of the LATAM Integrated Report received on march 28, 2022. 
The scope of a limited assurance engagement is essentially inferior 
to a reasonable assurance engagement, thus, we are not hereby 
providing opinion about the 2021 LATAM Integrated Report.

OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE
Following the combination of LAN and 
TAM in June 2012, TAM S.A. continues 
to exist as a subsidiary of Holdco I and 
a subsidiary of LATAM, and LAN Airlines 
S.A. has been redesignated as “LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. ”
Prior to the consummation of the 
business combination, LATAM Airlines 
Group, the Cueto Group, today a major 
shareholder, entered into several 
shareholders’ agreements with TAM, the 
Amaro Group (acting through TEP Chile) 
and Holdco I, establishing agreements 
and restrictions relating to corporate 
governance in an attempt to balance 
LATAM Airlines Group’s interests, as the 
owner of substantially all of the economic 
rights in TAM, and those of the Amaro 
Group by prohibiting the taking of certain 
specified material corporate actions and 
decisions without prior supermajority 
approval of the shareholders and/or the 
board of directors of Holdco I or TAM. 
These shareholders’ agreements also set 
forth the parties’ agreement regarding 
the governance and management of 
the LATAM Airlines Group following the 
consummation of the combination of 
LAN and TAM.Governance and Management of 
LATAM Airlines Group
We refer to the shareholders’ agreement

and operation of the LATAM Airlines 
Group, and voting and transfer of 
their respective LATAM Airlines Group 
common shares and TEP Chile’s voting 
shares of Holdco I, as the “Cueto Amaro 
shareholders’ agreement. ” We refer to 
the shareholders’ agreement between 
LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and TEP

•  the parties agree to vote their LATAM 
Airlines Group common shares to 
assist the other parties in removing 
and replacing the directors such other 
parties elected to the LATAM Airlines 
Group board of directors;
•  the parties agree to consult with 
one another and use their good faith 
efforts to reach an agreement on all 
actions (other than actions requiring 
supermajority approval under Chilean 
law) to be taken by the LATAM board 
of directors or the LATAM shareholders, 
and if unable to reach such agreement, 
to follow the proposal made by our 
board of directors;•  the parties agree to maintain the size 
of the LATAM Airlines Group board of 
directors at a total of nine directors 
and to maintain the quorum required 
for action by the LATAM Airlines Group 
board of directors at a majority of the

Airlines Group board of directors; and
•  if, after good faith efforts to reach an 
agreement with respect to any action 
that requires supermajority approval 
under Chilean law and a mediation 
period, the parties do not reach such 
an agreement, then TEP Chile has 
agreed to vote its shares on such 
supermajority matter as directed by 
the Cueto Group, which we refer to as 
a “directed vote. ”
The parties to the Holdco I shareholder’s 
agreement and TAM shareholders 
agreement have agreed to vote 
their voting shares of Holdco I and 
shares of TAM so as to give effect 
to the agreements with respect to 
representation on the TAM board of 
directors discussed above.
Transfer Restrictions
Pursuant to the Cueto Amaro 
shareholders’ agreement, the Cueto 
Group and TEP Chile are subject to 
certain restrictions on sales, transfers 
and pledges of the LATAM Airlines Group common shares and (in the case 
of TEP Chile only) the voting shares of 
Holdco I beneficially owned by them. 
Except for a limited amount of LATAM 
Airlines Group common shares, neither 
the Cueto Group nor TEP Chile were 
permitted to sell any of their LATAM 
Airlines Group common shares, and 
TEP Chile was not permitted to sell 
its voting shares of Holdco I, until 
June 2015. Since then, sales of LATAM 
Airlines Group common shares by 
either party are permitted, subject to 
(i) certain limitations on the volume 
and frequency of such sales and (ii) in 
the case of TEP Chile only, TEP Chile 
satisfying certain minimum ownership 
requirements. On or after December 
31, 2021, TEP Chile may sell all of 
its LATAM Airlines Group common 
shares and voting shares of Holdco I 
as a block, subject to (x) approval of 
the transferee by the LATAM board of 
directors, (y) the condition that the sale 
not have an adverse effect, and (z) a 
right of first offer in favor of the Cueto 
Group, which we refer to collectively 
as “block sale provisions. ” An “adverse 
effect” is defined in the Cueto Amaro 
shareholder’s agreement to mean a 
material adverse effect on our and 
Holdco I’s ability to own or receive the 
full benefits of ownership of TAM and 
its subsidiaries or the ability of TAM and 
its subsidiaries to operate their airline businesses worldwide. The Cueto Group 
has agreed to transfer any voting shares 
of Holdco I acquired pursuant to such 
right of first offer to LATAM for the same 
consideration paid for such shares.
In addition, TEP Chile may sell all LATAM 
Airlines Group common shares and 
voting shares of Holdco I beneficially 
owned by it as a block, subject to 
satisfaction of the block sale provisions,

occurs or if TEP Chile is required to 
make two or more directed votes during 
any 24-month period at two meetings 
(consecutive or not) of the shareholders 
of LATAM Airlines Group held at least 
12 months apart and LATAM Airlines 
Group has not yet fully exercised its 
conversion option described below. A 
“release event” will occur if (i) a capital 
increase of LATAM Airlines Group occurs, 
(ii) TEP Chile does not fully exercise the 
preemptive rights granted to it under 
applicable law in Chile with respect 
to such capital increase in respect 
of all of its restricted LATAM Airlines 
Group common shares, and (iii) after 
such capital increase is completed, 
the individual designated by TEP Chile 
for election to the board of directors 
of LATAM Airlines Group with the 
assistance of the Cueto Group is not 
elected to the board of directors of

Appendices 103In addition, after December 31, 2021 
and after the occurrence of the full 
ownership trigger date TEP Chile may 
sell all or any portion of its LATAM 
Airlines Group common shares, subject 
to (x) a right of first offer in favor of the 
LATAM Controlling Shareholders and 
(y) the restrictions on sales of LATAM 
Airlines Group common shares more 
than once in a 12-month period.
In addition, after December 31, 2021 
and after the occurrence of the full 
ownership trigger date, TEP Chile 
may sell all or any portion of its 
LATAM Airlines Group common shares, 
subject to (x) a right of first offer in 
favor of the Cueto Group and (y) the 
restrictions on sales of LATAM Airlines 
Group common shares more than once 
in a 12-month period.
The Cueto Amaro shareholders 
agreement provides certain exceptions 
to these restrictions on transfer for 
certain pledges of LATAM Airlines 
Group common shares made by the parties and for transfers to affiliates, 
in each case under certain limited 
circumstances.
Restriction on transfer of TAM shares
LATAM agreed in the Holdco I 
shareholders’ agreement not to sell or 
transfer any shares of TAM stock to any 
person (other than our affiliates) at any 
time when TEP Chile owns any voting 
shares of Holdco I. However, LATAM will 
have the right to effect such a sale or 
transfer if, at the same time as such 
sale or transfer, LATAM (or its assignee) 
acquires all the voting shares of Holdco 
I beneficially owned by TEP Chile for 
an amount equal to TEP Chile’s then 
current tax basis in such shares and any 
costs TEP Chile is required to incur to 
effect such sale or transfer. TEP Chile 
has irrevocably granted us the assignable 
right to purchase all of the voting shares 
of Holdco I beneficially owned by TEP 
Chile in connection with any such sale.
Conversion Option
Pursuant to the Cueto Amaro 
shareholders’ agreement and the Holdco 
I shareholders’ agreement, we have the 
unilateral right to convert our shares 
of non-voting stock of Holdco I into 
shares of voting stock of Holdco I to the 
maximum extent allowed under law and 
to increase our representation on the 
TAM and Holdco I boards of directors if and when permitted in accordance 
with foreign ownership control laws in 
Brazil and other applicable laws if the 
conversion would not have an adverse 
effect. In February 2019, we completed 
the procedures for the exchange of 
shares of Holdco I S.A., through which 
LATAM Airlines Group SA increased its 
indirect participation in TAM S.A., from 
48.99% to 51.04%. This transaction was 
undertaken pursuant to the Provisional 
Measure 863/2018 of December 13, 
2018, through which the participation of 
up to 100% of foreign capital in airlines 
in Brazil is permitted.
On or after December 31, 2021, and 
after we have fully converted all of our 
shares of non-voting stock of Holdco I 
into shares of voting stock of Holdco I 
as permitted by Brazilian law and other 
applicable laws, we will have the right 
to purchase all of the voting shares 
of Holdco I held by the controlling 
shareholders of TAM for an amount 
equal to their then current tax basis in 
such shares and any costs incurred by 
them to effect such sale, which amount 
we refer to as the “sale consideration. ” 
If we do not timely exercise our right 
to purchase these shares or if, after 
December 31, 2021, we have the right 
under applicable law in Brazil and other 
applicable law to fully convert all the 
shares of non-voting stock of Holdco I beneficially owned by us into shares 
of voting stock of Holdco I and such 
conversion would not have an adverse 
effect but we have not fully exercised 
such right within a specified period, then 
the controlling shareholders of TAM 
will have the right to put their shares 
of voting stock of Holdco I to us for an 
amount equal to the sale consideration.
Acquisitions of TAM Stock
The parties have agreed that all 
acquisitions of TAM common shares 
by LATAM Airlines Group, Holdco I, TAM 
or any of their respective subsidiaries 
from and after the effective time of the 
combination will be made by Holdco I.Corporate governance

and enforcement agencies in each 
of the countries where we operate. 
We believe we have obtained and 
maintained the necessary authority, 
including authorizations and operative 
certificates where required, which 
are subject to ongoing compliance 
with statutes, rules and regulations 
pertaining to the airline industry, 
including any rules and regulations that 
may be adopted in the future.
The countries where we carry out 
most of our operations are contracting 
states and permanent members of 
the ICAO, an agency of the United 
Nations established in 1947 to assist 
in the planning and development of 
international air transportation. The 
ICAO establishes technical standards for the international aviation industry. In the 
absence of an applicable local regulation 
concerning safety or maintenance, 
the countries where we operate have 
incorporated by reference the majority 
of the ICAO’s technical standards. 
We believe that we are in material 
compliance with all such relevant 
technical standards.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND NOISE 
REGULATION
There are no material environmental 
regulations or controls in the 
jurisdictions in which we operate 
imposed upon airlines, applicable to 
aircraft, or that otherwise affect us, 
except for environmental laws and 
regulations of general applicability.
In Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru and the United States, 
aircraft must comply with certain 
noise restrictions. LATAM’s aircraft 
substantially comply with all such 
restrictions. Chilean authorities are 
planning to pass a noise-related 
regulation governing aircraft that 
fly to and within Chile, observing 
a standard known as “Stage 3 
requirements. ” Our fleet already 
complies with such standards, so we 
do not believe that enactment of the 
proposed standards would impose a 
material burden on us.In 2016, the ICAO adopted a resolution 
creating the Carbon Offsetting and 
Reduction Scheme for International 
Aviation (CORSIA), providing a 
framework for a global market-based 
measure to stabilize CO2 emissions 
in international civil aviation (i.e., 
civil aviation flights that depart in 
one country and arrive in a different 
country). With the adoption of this 
framework, the aviation industry 
became the first industry to achieve 
an agreement with respect to its CO2 
emissions. The scheme, which defines 
a unified standard to regulate CO2 
emissions in international flights, will be 
implemented in various phases by ICAO 
member states starting in 2021 (with 
the voluntary member states).
SAFETY AND SECURITY
Our operations are subject to the 
jurisdiction of various agencies in each 
of the countries where we operate, 
which set standards and requirements 
for the operation of aircraft and its 
maintenance.
In the United States, the Aviation and 
Transportation Security Act requires, 
among other things, the implementation 
of certain security measures by airlines 
and airports, such as the requirement 
that all passenger bags be screened 
for explosives. Funding for airline and airport security required under the 
Aviation Security Act is provided in part 
by a US$5.60 per segment passenger 
security fee, subject to a US$11.20 
per round-trip cap; however, airlines 
are responsible for costs in excess 
of this fee. Implementation of the 
requirements of the Aviation Security 
Act has resulted in increased costs for 
airlines and their passengers. Since the 
events of September 11, 2001, the 
United States Congress has mandated, 
and the TSA has implemented, 
numerous security procedures and 
requirements that have imposed and will 
continue to impose burdens on airlines, 
passengers and shippers.
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 117Below are some specific aeronautical 
regulations  related to route rights and 
pricing policy in the countries where 
we operate.
CHILE
Aeronautical Regulation
Both the DGAC and the Junta de 
Aeronáutica Civil (“JAC”) oversee 
and regulate the Chilean aviation 
industry. The DGAC reports directly 
to the Chilean Air Force and is 
responsible for supervising compliance 
with Chilean laws and regulations 
relating to air navigation. The JAC is 
the Chilean civil aviation authority. 
Primarily on the basis of Decree Law 
nº 2.564, which regulates commercial 
aviation, the JAC establishes the main 
commercial policies for the aviation 
industry in Chile and regulates the 
assignment of international routes 
and the compliance with certain 
insurance requirements, while the 
DGAC regulates flight operations, 
including personnel, aircraft and 
security standards, air traffic control 
and airport management. We have 
obtained and maintain the necessary 
authority from the Chilean government 
to conduct flight operations, including 
authorization certificates from the JAC 
and technical operative certificates 
from the DGAC, the continuation 
of which is subject to the ongoing compliance with applicable statutes, 
rules and regulations pertaining to the 
airline industry, including any rules and 
regulations that may be adopted in 
the future.
Chile is a contracting state, as well as 
a permanent member, of the ICAO. 
Chilean authorities have incorporated 
ICAO’s technical standards for the 
international aviation industry 
into Chilean laws and regulations. 
In the absence of an applicable 
Chilean regulation concerning safety 
or maintenance, the DGAC has 
incorporated by reference the majority 
of the ICAO’s technical standards. 
We believe that we are in material 
compliance with all such relevant 
technical standards.
Route Rights
Domestic Routes: Chilean airlines are 
not required to obtain permits in order 
to carry passengers or cargo on any 
domestic routes, but only to comply 
with the technical and insurance 
requirements established respectively 
by the DGAC and the JAC. There are no 
regulatory barriers that would prevent 
a foreign airline from creating a Chilean 
subsidiary and entering the Chilean 
domestic market using that subsidiary. 
On January 18, 2012 the Secretary 
of Transportation and the Secretary of Economics of Chile announced 
a unilateral opening of the Chilean 
domestic skies. This was confirmed in 
November 2013, and has been in force 
since that date.
International Routes: As an airline 
providing services on international 
routes, LATAM is also subject to a 
variety of bilateral civil air transportation 
agreements that provide for the 
exchange of air traffic rights between 
Chile and various other countries. There 
can be no assurance that existing 
bilateral agreements between Chile and 
foreign governments will continue, and a 
modification, suspension or revocation 
of one or more bilateral treaties could 
have a material adverse effect on our 
operations and financial results.
International route rights, as well as the 
corresponding landing rights, are derived 
from a variety of air transportation 
agreements negotiated between Chile 
and foreign governments. Under such 
agreements, the government of one 
country grants the government of 
another country the right to designate 
one or more of its domestic airlines to 
operate scheduled services to certain 
destinations of the former and, in 
certain cases, to further connect to 
third-country destinations. In Chile, 
when additional route frequencies to and from foreign cities become 
available, any eligible airline may apply 
to obtain them. If there is more than 
one applicant for a route frequency,  
the JAC awards it through a public 
auction for a period of five years.  
The JAC grants route frequencies subject 
to the condition that the recipient airline 
operates them on a permanent basis. If 
an airline fails to operate a route for a 
period of six months or more, the JAC 
may terminate its rights to that route. 
International route frequencies are 
freely transferable. In the past, we have 
generally paid only nominal amounts for 
international route frequencies obtained 
in uncontested auctions.
Airfare Pricing Policy
Chilean airlines are permitted to 
establish their own domestic and 
international fares without government 
regulation. For more information, see 
“—Antitrust Regulation” below. In 1997, 
the Antitrust Commission approved 
and imposed a specific self-regulatory 
fare plan for our domestic operations 
in Chile consistent with the Antitrust 
Commission’s directive to maintain a 
competitive environment. According 
to this plan, we must file notice with 
the JAC of any increase or decrease 
in standard fares on routes deemed 
“non-competitive” by the JAC and any 
decrease in fares on “competitive” REGULATIONOur business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 118routes at least 20 days in advance. We 
must file notice with the JAC of any 
increase in fares on “competitive” routes 
at least 10 days in advance. In addition, 
the Chilean authorities now require that 
we justify any modification that we 
make to our fares on non-competitive 
routes. We must also ensure that our 
average yields on a non-competitive 
route are not higher than those on 
competitive routes of similar distance.
PERU
Aeronautical Regulation
The Peruvian Dirección General de 
Aeronáutica Civil (the “PDGAC”) 
oversees and regulates the Peruvian 
aviation industry. The PDGAC reports 
directly to the Ministry of Transportation 
and Communications and is responsible 
for supervising compliance with 
Peruvian laws and regulations relating 
to air navigation. In addition, the 
PDGAC regulates the assignment of 
national and international routes, and 
the compliance with certain insurance 
requirements, and it regulates flight 
operations, including personnel, aircraft 
and security standards, air traffic 
control and airport management. 
We have obtained and maintain the 
necessary authorizations from the 
Peruvian government to conduct flight 
operations, including authorization and 
technical operative certificates, the continuation of which is subject to the 
ongoing compliance with applicable 
statutes, rules and regulations 
pertaining to the airline industry, 
including any rules and regulations that 
may be adopted in the future.
Peru is a contracting state and a 
permanent member of the ICAO. The 
ICAO establishes technical standards for 
the international aviation industry, which 
Peruvian authorities have incorporated 
into Peruvian laws and regulations. In 
the absence of an applicable Peruvian 
regulation concerning safety or 
maintenance, the PDGAC has incorporated 
by reference the majority of the ICAO’s 
technical standards. We believe that 
we are in material compliance with all 
relevant technical standards.
Route Rights
Domestic Routes: Peruvian airlines are 
required to obtain permits in connection 
with carrying passengers or cargo on any 
domestic routes and to comply with the 
technical requirements established by 
the PDGAC. Non-Peruvian airlines are 
not permitted to provide domestic air 
service between destinations in Peru.
International Routes: As an airline 
providing services on international 
routes, LATAM Airlines Peru is also 
subject to a variety of bilateral civil air transport agreements that provide 
for the exchange of air traffic rights 
between Peru and various other 
countries. There can be no assurance 
that existing bilateral agreements 
between Peru and foreign governments 
will continue, and a modification, 
suspension or revocation of one or more 
bilateral treaties could have a material 
adverse effect on our operations and 
financial results.
International route rights, as well as 
the corresponding landing rights, are 
derived from a variety of air transport 
agreements negotiated between Peru 
and foreign governments. Under such 
agreements, the government of one 
country grants the government of 
another country the right to designate 
one or more of its domestic airlines to 
operate scheduled services to certain 
destinations of the former and, in 
certain cases, to further connect to 
third-country destinations. In Peru, 
when additional route frequencies 
to and from foreign cities become 
available, any eligible airline may apply 
to obtain them. If there is more than 
one applicant for a route frequency, 
the PDGAC awards it through a public 
auction for a period of four years. The 
PDGAC grants route frequencies subject 
to the condition that the recipient airline 
operates them on a permanent basis. If an airline fails to operate a route for a 
period of 90 days or more, the PDGAC 
may terminate its rights to that route. 
In recent years the PDGAC has revoked 
the unused route frequencies of several 
Peruvian operators.
ECUADOR
Aeronautical Regulation
There are two institutions that control 
commercial aviation on behalf of 
the State: (i) The Consejo Nacional 
de Aviación Civil (the “CNAC”), which 
directs aviation policy; and (ii)  ( the 
“DGAC”), which is a technical regulatory 
and control agency. The CNAC 
issues operating permits and grants 
operating concessions to national and 
international airlines. It also issues 
opinions on bilateral and multilateral 
air transportation treaties, allocates 
routes and traffic rights, and approves 
joint operating agreements such as wet 
leases and shared codes.
Fundamentally, the DGAC is responsible for:
• ensuring that the national standards 
and technical regulations and 
international ICAO standards and 
regulations are observed;
• keeping records on insurance, 
airworthiness and licenses of 
Ecuadorian civil aircraft;REGULATIONOur business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 119• maintaining the National Aircraft 
Registry;
• issuing licenses to crews;
• controlling air traffic control inside 
domestic air space;
• approving shared codes; and 
• modifying operations permits.
The DGAC also must comply with the 
standards and recommended methods 
of ICAO since Ecuador is a signatory of 
the 1944 Chicago Convention.
Route Rights
Domestic Routes: Airlines must obtain 
authorization from CNAC (an operating 
permit or concession) to provide air 
transportation. For domestic operations, 
only companies incorporated in Ecuador 
can operate locally, and only Ecuadorian-
licensed aircraft and dry leases are 
authorized to operate domestically.
International Routes: Permits for 
international operations are based on 
air transportation treaties signed by 
Ecuador or, otherwise, the principle 
of reciprocity is applied. All airlines 
doing business in Latin America that 
are incorporated in countries that are 
members of the Comunidad Andina de Naciones (the Andean Community, or 
“CAN”) obtain their traffic rights on the 
basis of decisions currently in force under 
that regime, in particular decision N°582 
of 2004, which guarantee free access 
to markets, with no type of restriction 
except technical considerations.
Airfare Pricing Policy
On October 13, 2011, The Statutory Law 
of Regulation and Control of the Market 
Power was passed with a purpose 
to avoid, prevent, correct, eliminate 
and sanction the abuse of economic 
operators with market power, as well 
as to sanction restrictive, disloyal and 
agreements involving collusive practices. 
This Law creates a new public entity as 
the maximum authority of application 
and establishes the procedures of 
investigation and the applicable 
sanctions, which are severe. Rates are 
not regulated and are subject only to 
registration. In general, bilateral treaties 
regarding air transportation provide 
for airfares to be regulated by the 
regulation of the country of origin.
BRAZIL
Aeronautical Regulation
The Brazilian aviation industry is 
regulated and overseen by the ANAC. 
The ANAC reports directly to the 
Civil Aviation Secretary, which is 
subordinated by the Federal Executive Power of this country. Primarily on the 
basis of Law nº 11.182/2005, the ANAC 
was created to regulate commercial 
aviation, air navigation, the assignment 
of domestic and international routes, 
compliance with certain insurance 
requirements, flight operations, 
including personnel, aircraft and security 
standards, air traffic control, in this case 
sharing its activities and responsibilities 
with the Departamento de Controle 
do Espaço Aéreo (Department of 
Airspace Control or “DECEA”), which is 
a public secretary also subordinated 
to the Brazilian Defense Ministry, 
and airport management, in this last 
case sharing responsibilities with the 
Empresa Brasileira de Infra-Estrutura 
Aeroportuária (the Brazilian Airport 
Infrastructure Company, or “INFRAERO”), 
a public company that was created by 
Law nº 5862/72, and is responsible for 
administrating, operating and exploring 
Brazilian airports industrially and 
commercially (with the exception of 
airports granted to private initiative).
We have obtained and maintain the 
necessary authority from the Brazilian 
government to conduct flight operations, 
including authorization and technical 
operative certificates from ANAC, the 
continuation of which is subject to 
ongoing compliance with applicable 
statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to the airline industry, including any rules 
and regulations that may be adopted in 
the future.
ANAC is the Brazilian civil aviation 
authority and it is responsible for 
supervising compliance with Brazilian 
laws and regulations relating to air 
navigation. Brazil is a contracting state 
and a permanent member of the ICAO. 
The ICAO establishes technical standards 
for the international aviation industry, 
which Brazilian authorities, represented 
by the Brazilian Defense Ministry, 
have incorporated into Brazilian laws 
and regulations. In the absence of an 
applicable Brazilian regulation concerning 
safety or maintenance, ANAC has 
incorporated by reference the majority of 
the ICAO’s technical standards.
Route Rights
Domestic Routes: Brazilian airlines 
operate under a public services 
concession, and for that reason 
Brazilian airlines are required to obtain 
a concession to provide passenger and 
cargo air transportation services from 
the Brazilian authorities. In addition, 
an Air Operator Certificate (“AOC”) is 
also required for Brazilian Airlines to 
provide regular domestic passenger or 
cargo transportation services. Brazilian 
Airlines also need to comply with all 
technical requirements established by REGULATIONOur business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 120the Brazilian Aviation Authority (ANAC). 
Based on the Brazilian Aeronautical 
Code (“CBA”) established by Brazilian 
Federal Law nº. 7 .565/86, there are no 
limitations to ownership of Brazilian 
airlines by foreign investors. The CBA 
also states that non-Brazilian airlines 
are not authorized to provide domestic 
air transportation services in Brazil.
International Routes: Brazilian and non-
Brazilian airlines providing services on 
international routes are also subject to 
a variety of bilateral civil air transport 
agreements that provide for the exchange 
of air traffic rights between Brazil and 
various other countries. International 
route rights, as well as the corresponding 
landing rights, are derived from a variety 
of air transport agreements negotiated 
between Brazil and foreign governments. 
Under such agreements, the government 
of one country grants the government 
of another country the right to designate 
one or more of its domestic airlines to 
operate scheduled services to certain 
destinations of the former and, in certain 
cases, to further connect to third-country 
destinations. In Brazil, when additional 
route frequencies to and from foreign cities 
become available, any eligible airline may 
apply to obtain them. If there is more than 
one applicant for a route frequency ANAC 
must carry out a public bid and award it 
to the elected airline. ANAC grants route frequencies subject to the condition that 
the recipient airline operates them on a 
permanent basis. ANAC’s resolution 491/18 
indicates the requirements to establish 
the underuse of a frequency, and how it 
could be revoked and reassigned. This 
provision of the resolution came into 
force in September 2019.
Airfare Pricing Policy
Brazilian and non-Brazilian airlines 
are permitted to establish their own 
international and domestic fares, in 
this last case only for Brazilian airlines, 
without government regulation, as long 
as they do not abuse any dominant 
market position they may enjoy. Airlines 
may file complaints before the Antitrust 
Court with respect to monopolistic or 
other pricing practices by other airlines 
that violate Brazil’s antitrust laws.
COLOMBIA
Aeronautical Regulation
The governmental entity in charge of 
regulating, directing and supervising civil 
aviation in Colombia is the Aeronáutica 
Civil (the “AC”), a technical agency 
ascribed to the Ministry of Transportation. 
The AC is the aeronautical authority 
for the entire domestic territory, in 
charge of regulating and supervising 
the Colombian air space. The AC may 
interpret, apply and complement all 
civil aviation and air transportation regulation to ensure compliance with 
the Colombian Aeronautical Regulations 
(“RAC”). The AC also grants the 
necessary permits for air transportation.
Route Rights
The AC grants operation permits to 
domestic and foreign carriers that intend 
to operate in, from and to Colombia. 
In the case of Colombian airlines, in 
order to obtain the operational permit, 
the company must comply with the 
RAC and fulfill legal, economic and 
technical requirements, to later be 
subject to public hearings where the 
public convenience and necessity of 
the service is considered. The same 
process must be followed to add 
national or international routes; whose 
concession is subject to the bilateral 
instruments entered into by Colombia. 
The only exception for not complying 
with the public hearing procedure is that 
the application comes from a country 
member of the CAN, or that the route 
or permit being applied for is part of a 
deregulated regime. Even if it does not 
go through the public hearing process, 
the airline must submit a complete 
study to the AC and the request is made 
public on the website of the authority. 
Routes cannot be transferred under any 
circumstance and there is no limit to 
foreign investment in domestic airlines.Airfare Pricing Policy
Since July 2007, as stated in resolution 
3299 of the Aeronautical Civil entity, 
bottom level airfares for both international 
and domestic transportation were 
eliminated. Under resolution 904 issued 
in February 2012, the Aeronautical Civil 
authority ceased to impose the obligation 
of charging a fuel surcharge for both 
domestic and international transportation 
of passengers and cargo. As of April 
1, 2012, air carriers may now freely 
decide whether to add a fuel charge. 
In the case that a fuel surcharge is 
charged, it must be part of the fare, 
but shall be informed separately on the 
tickets, advertising or other methods of 
marketing used by the company.
In the same line, as of April 1, 2012, 
there is no longer any restriction on 
maximum fares published by the airlines 
or with respect to the obligations for air 
carriers to report to the Aeronautical civil 
authority the fares and conditions the 
day after being published.
Administrative fares are not subject 
to any changes, and its charge is 
mandatory for the transport of 
passengers under Aeronautical Civil 
Regulations. Differential administrative 
fares apply to ticket sales made through 
Internet channels.REGULATIONOur business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 121ANTITRUST REGULATION
Chile
The Chilean antitrust authority, which 
we refer to as the National Economic 
Prosecutor Office (“FNE” by its Spanish 
name), oversees and investigates 
antitrust matters, which are governed 
by Decree Law No. 211 of 1973, as 
amended, or the “Antitrust Law. ” The 
Antitrust Law states as anticompetitive, 
any conduct that prevents, restricts 
or hinders competition, or sets out to 
produce said effects.
The Antitrust Law continues by 
giving examples of the following 
anticompetitive conducts: (i) cartels; (ii) 
abuse of dominance; and (iii) interlocking. 
The Antitrust Law defines abusive 
practices as “ The abusive exploitation 
on the part of an economic agent, or a 
group thereof, of a dominant position in 
the market, fixing sale or purchase prices, 
imposing on a sale the acquisition of 
another product, allocating territories or 
market quotas or imposing similar abuses 
on others; as well as predatory practices, 
or unfair competition, carried out with 
the purpose of reaching, maintaining or 
increasing a dominant position. ”
An aggrieved person may sue for damages 
arising from a breach of Antitrust Law 
by suing in the Chilean Competition Court (the “TDLC” by its Spanish name). 
The TDLC has the authority to impose 
a variety of sanctions for violations 
of the Antitrust Law, including: (i) the 
amendment or termination of acts 
and contracts; (ii) the amendment or 
dissolution of legal entities involved in 
the punished conducts; and/or (iii) the 
imposition of a fine up to 30% of the 
sales of the infringing entity corresponding 
to the line of products and/or services 
associated to the infraction, during the 
entire term for which the infringement 
lasted; alternatively, a fine equal to the 
double of the economic benefit obtained 
by the infringing company; and when none 
of these alternatives can be applied, a 
fine up to USD 50,000,000 approximately 
(60,000 UTA).
As described above under “Route 
Rights — Airfare Pricing Policy, ” in 
the Resolution n°445 of August 1995, 
the TDLC approved a merger control 
transaction between LAN Chile and 
LANDECO but imposed a specific 
self-regulatory fare plan for domestic 
air passenger market consistent with 
the TDLC’s directive to maintain a 
competitive environment within the 
domestic market. This Airfare Pricing 
Policy Plan was updated by the TDLC 
particularly to maintain its objective 
which consists of a tariff regulation, 
through which maximum rates are established on non-competitive routes 
under a monthly compliance scheme.
Since October 1997, LATAM and LATAM 
Chile follow a self-regulatory plan, 
which was modified and approved by 
the TDLC in July 2005, and further in 
September 2011. In February 2010, the 
FNE closed the investigation initiated 
in 2007 regarding our compliance with 
this self-regulatory plan and no further 
observations were made.
As a condition to the combination 
between LAN and TAM in June 2012, 
the antitrust authorities in Chile and 
Brazil each imposed certain mitigation 
measures as part of their approval of 
the merger transaction. Furthermore, 
the association was also submitted to 
the antitrust authorities in Germany, 
Italy and Spain. All these jurisdictions 
granted unconditional clearances for this 
transaction. The merger was filed with 
the Argentinean antitrust authorities; 
approval is still pending. For more 
information regarding these mitigation 
measures please see below:
On September 21, 2011, the TDLC issued 
a decision (the “Decision”) with respect 
to the consultation procedure initiated 
on January 28, 2011 in connection with 
the combination between LAN and TAM. 
The TDLC, in the Decision, approved the proposed combination between LAN 
and TAM, subject to 14 conditions, as 
generally described below:
• exchange of certain slots in the 
Guarulhos Airport at São Paulo, Brazil;
• extension of the frequent flyer 
program to airlines operating or 
willing to operate the Santiago-
São Paulo, Santiago-Río de Janeiro, 
Santiago-Montevideo and Santiago-
Asunción routes during the five-year 
period from the effective time of the 
combination;
• execution of interline agreements 
with airlines operating the Santiago-
São Paulo, Santiago-Río de Janeiro 
and Santiago-Asunción routes;
• certain capacity and other transitory 
restrictions applicable to the 
Santiago-São Paulo route;
• certain amendments to LAN’s self-
regulatory fare plan approved by the 
TDLC with respect to LAN’s domestic 
passenger business;
• the obligation of LATAM to renounce 
to one global airline alliance within 24 
months from the date in which the 
combination becomes effective, except 
in the case that the TDLC approves REGULATIONOur business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 122otherwise, or to elect not to participate in 
any global airline alliance;
• certain restrictions on code-sharing 
agreements outside the global airline 
alliance to which LATAM belongs 
for routes with origin or destination 
in Chile or that connect to North 
America and Europe, or with Avianca/
TACA or Gol for international routes 
in South America, including the 
obligation to consult with, and obtain 
approval from, the TDLC prior to 
its execution of certain of those 
codeshare agreements;
• the abandonment of four air traffic 
frequencies with fifth freedom rights 
between Chile and Peru and limitations 
on acquiring in excess of 75%, as 
applicable, of the air traffic frequencies 
in that route and the period that 
certain air traffic frequencies may be 
granted by the Chilean air transport 
authorities to LATAM;
• issuance of a statement by LATAM 
supporting the unilateral opening of 
the Chilean domestic skies (cabotage) 
and abstention from any actions that 
would prevent such opening;
• promotion by LATAM of the growth 
and normal operation of the 
Guarulhos (Brazil) and Arturo Merino Benítez (Chile) airports, to facilitate 
access thereto to other airlines;
• certain restrictions regarding 
incentives to travel agencies;
• to maintain temporarily 12 round trip 
flights per week between Chile and 
the United States and at least seven 
round trip non-stop flights per week 
between Chile and Europe;
• certain transitory restrictions on 
increasing fares in the Santiago-São 
Paulo and Santiago-Río de Janeiro 
routes for the passenger business 
and for the Chile-Brazil routes for the 
cargo business; and
• engaging an independent consultant, 
expert in airline operations, which 
for 36 months, and in coordination 
with the FNE, will monitor and audit 
compliance with the conditions 
imposed by the Decision.
Around June 2015, the FNE initiated 
a legal claim against LATAM before 
the TDLC alleging that LATAM was 
not complying with certain mitigation 
conditions related to the code share 
agreements with airlines outside 
LATAM’s global alliance as referenced 
above. Although LATAM opposed this 
allegation and responded to the claim accordingly, a settlement agreement 
was reached between the FNE and 
LATAM (the “Settlement Agreement”). 
The Settlement Agreement approved 
by the TDLC on December 22, 2015 
terminated the legal proceeding initiated 
by the FNE and did not establish any 
violation of the TDLC resolutions or 
any applicable antitrust regulations 
by LATAM. The Settlement Agreement 
did establish the obligation of LATAM 
to amend/terminate certain code 
share agreements and contract an 
independent third party consultant, 
which would act as an advisor to the 
FNE to monitor the compliance by 
LATAM of the Seventh Condition and the 
Settlement Agreement.
On October 31, 2018, the TDLC 
approved the joint business agreements 
between LATAM and American Airlines, 
and between LATAM and IAG, subject 
to nine mitigation measures. On 
May 23, 2019 the Supreme Court of 
Chile revoked the TDLC decision, and 
both agreements were rejected. On 
September 26, 2019, LATAM announced 
that the JBA with American Airlines 
would be terminated and, on December 
6, 2019, LATAM announced that the JBA

such proposal, an “ Exit Proposal ”) 
from its most significant claimholders 
and its majority shareholders. Each 
Exit Proposal contemplates raising 
new funds in excess of US$5,000 
millions through the issuance of new 
debt and equity in LATAM, which 
would be backstopped by the parties 
making the proposal. In addition, in 
each Exit Proposal, the proponents 
contemplate that if such proposal is 
approved and implemented, it would 
result in the substantial dilution of 
LATAM’s currently existing shares. 
• LATAM will continue to discuss the 
Exit Proposals with their respective proponents, and will continue to 
engage in discussions regarding 
its reorganization plan with such 
proponents and other stakeholders, 
some of whom have agreed to remain 
under non-disclosure agreements.  
• LATAM is focused on ensuring that 
any exit strategy allows it to emerge 
from the Chapter 11 Proceeding with 
a robust capital structure, adequate 
liquidity, and the ability to execute 
its business plan in a sustainable 
manner over time. Any plan will be 
implemented in accordance with the 
relevant requirements of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code and Chilean law. 
• The Company will keep its 
shareholders and the market 
informed of the progress of the 
Chapter 11 Proceeding. In addition, 
and without limiting the generality of 
the foregoing, LATAM contemplates 
to summon its shareholders to an 
extraordinary shareholders meeting 
when appropriate, subject to the 
progress of the negotiations with 
the various stakeholders that are 
currently pending. 
2. LATAM’s Request to Extend the 
Exclusivity Periods:  
• On this date, LATAM and its subsidiaries subject to the Chapter 
11 Proceeding filed a motion with the 
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern 
District of New York (the “ Court ”) 
seeking to extend the periods 
during which the Debtors will have 
the exclusive right to file a plan of 
reorganization from September 15, 2021 
to October 15, 2021, and the exclusive 
right to solicit acceptances of a plan 
from November 8, 2021, to December 
15, 2021 (collectively, the “Exclusivity 
Periods”). The Court is scheduled to 
consider the motion at a hearing to be 
held on September 23, 2021. 
• This request will support the 
development of a plan of 
reorganization that satisfies the 
equity and debt needs, and will assist 
in the negotiation with the various 
stakeholders in the Chapter 11 
Proceeding. 
3. LATAM’s Solicitation of Interest for 
Potential Tranche B Funding: 
• As previously reported, the English-
language financing agreement 
entered into in the context of the 
Chapter 11 Proceeding, denominated 
Super-Priority DebtorIn-Possession 
Term Loan Agreement (the “ DIP Credit 
Agreement ”) provides for a possible 
Tranche B for up to US$750 million, Our business

Appendices 130subject to the Court’s authorization 
and other customary conditions for 
this type of transactions. This is in 
addition to the existing US$1,300 
million Tranche A facility and the 
US$1,150 million Tranche C facility. 
• It is worth mentioning that LATAM 
continues to have availability under 
the Tranche A facility and the Tranche 
C facility, for US$424.5 millions and 
US$375.5 millions, respectively.  
• Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in 
order to take advantage of favorable 
market conditions, LATAM is requesting 
proposals from parties interested in 
providing financing under Tranche B 
of the DIP Credit Agreement. Once 
such proposals are received, LATAM 
will consider such proposals with its 
advisors in due course. 
• The Tranche B, if any, will be secured 
by the same assets that currently 
secure Tranche A and Tranche C; 
provided, however, that the Tranche 
A liens will be senior to the Tranche B 
liens, and the Tranche B liens will be 
senior to the Tranche C liens. 
As indicated above, the Company will keep 
shareholders and the market informed on 
the progress of the Chapter 11 Proceeding. Santiago, September 29, 2021 
MATERIAL FACT 
Pursuant to the provisions set forth 
in Article 9 and the second paragraph 
of Article 10 of the Securities Market 
Law, and in General Rule No. 30, duly 
authorized, I hereby report the following 
MATERIAL FACT of LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A. (“ LATAM ” or the “ Company ”), 
registration in the Securities Registry 
No. 306: 
• As previously reported, the Super-
Priority Debtor-In-Possession Term 
Loan Agreement (the “ DIP Credit 
Agreement ”) entered into in the 
context of the reorganization process 
of LATAM and certain of its direct 
and indirect subsidiaries in the United 
States of America (the “ Chapter 11 
Proceeding ”) contemplates a possible 
Tranche B for up to US$750 million, 
subject to the authorization of the 
Bankruptcy Court of the Southern 
District of New York hearing the 
Chapter 11 Proceeding (the “ Court ”) 
and other customary conditions for 
this type of transaction. This is in 
addition to the $1.3 billion Tranche A 
facility and the $1.15 billion Tranche C 
facility currently existing thereunder. 
• As informed by means of a material 
fact dated September 9, 2021, in 
order to take advantage of favorable market conditions, this is, lower 
financing costs under the DIP Credit 
Agreement, LATAM had requested 
proposals from parties interested in 
providing financing under the Tranche 
B facility of the DIP Credit Agreement 
in an amount up to US$750 million. 
This is notwithstanding that LATAM 
continues to maintain availability 
under the Tranche A and Tranche C 
facilities for US$424.5 million and 
US$375.5 million, respectively. 
• In response to the above, LATAM has 
received various financing proposals 
which have been evaluated and 
negotiated in a timely manner by the 
Company together with its advisors. 
In this regard, the LATAM’s Directors 
Committee, at meetings held on 
September 21 and 23, 2021, reviewed 
such financing proposals and 
recommended the Board of Directors 
to approve the proposal submitted 
by a group of financiers comprised 
of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. 
(“OCM”) and Apollo Management 
Holdings, L.P. (“Apollo”) and certain 
funds, accounts and entities advised 
by OCM and Apollo (hereinafter, the 
“Tranche B DIP Financing Proposal”). 
At a meeting held on September 24, 
2021, the Board of Directors -by 
unanimous vote of the independent 
directors-, resolved to approve the Tranche B DIP Financing Proposal, 
subject to the Court’s approval. 
Notwithstanding, the aforementioned, 
LATAM could receive other financing 
proposals for Tranche B of the DIP 
Credit Agreement, which would be 
timely evaluated by the Company and 
its advisors.  
• An amendment to the DIP Credit 
Agreement (the “ Tranche B 
Amendment ”) to effectuate the 
Tranche B DIP Financing Proposal was 
submitted to the Court for approval 
on this same date. The Tranche B DIP 
Financing Proposal shall be subject to 
the terms and conditions set forth in 
the DIP Credit Agreement, except for 
the particularities of the Tranche B 
Amendment, which are indicated below: 
–   Lenders : Group of lenders consisting 
of OCM and Apollo and certain funds, 
accounts and entities advised by 
OCM and Apollo. 
–   Committed Amount : US$750 million, 
for principal amount. 
–   Maturity Date: As well as the Tranche 
A facility and the Tranche C facility, 
the scheduled maturity date of the 
Tranche B Financing Proposal is April 
8, 2022, subject to the possibility that 
LATAM may extend such maturity date Our business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
MATERIAL FACTS  
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 131for an additional 60-day period in the 
event that LATAM’s reorganization plan 
has been confirmed by an order of the 
Court but substantial consummation 
thereof is still pending under the 
rules of the Chapter 11 Proceeding. In 
addition, the Tranche B Amendment 
provides that the Tranche A and the 
Tranche B lenders have consented 
to an extension of the maturity 
date by LATAM in its sole discretion 
up to June 30, 2022. All of the 
foregoing, unless the maturity date 
is accelerated in accordance with its 
terms, including, without limitation, 
in the event of an event of default 
under the DIP Credit Agreement 
(hereinafter, the “ Maturity Date ”). 
    •  It should be added that the possibility 
of extending the maturity date until 
June 30, 2022 under the terms 
indicated in the preceding paragraph 
does not apply to the Tranche 
C facility. Consequently, should 
LATAM desire to extend the maturity 
date of Tranche C facility until the 
aforementioned date, it will require 
the consent of the Tranche C creditors. 
–  Interest and Fees : 
    •   Interest : Both the applicable 
interest rate and the interest 
payment dates will depend on the choice made by LATAM at the 
time of requesting a disbursement 
under the Tranche B facility, and 
LATAM may choose between (i) 
paying interest in cash at the 
maturity of each quarterly interest 
period, or (ii) capitalizing such 
interest on a quarterly basis to 
be paid in on the Maturity Date. 
In either case, LATAM may also 
choose the applicable interest 
rate, choosing between the 
Eurodollar rate or the Alternate 
Base Rate (“ ABR”).  
    •   Loans whose interest is payable 
in cash at the end of each interest 
period will bear interest at LIBO plus 
7% per annum for Eurodollar loans 
and 6% per annum plus the base 
rate for ABR loans. 
   •   Loans whose interest is capitalized 
on a quarterly basis for payment on 
the Maturity Date will bear interest 
at LIBO plus 7 .5% per annum in the 
case of Eurodollar loans and at 6.5% 
per annum plus the base rate in the 
case of ABR loans. 
    –    Fees and Other Charges:  
    •  An availability fee ( Undrawn 
Commitment Fee ) payable in cash 
equal to 0.50% on the daily unused Tranche B commitment per annum, 
which will be calculated daily, and 
will be payable on the last business 
day of each quarter until the 
Maturity Date. 
    •  A Yield-enhancement Payment 
payable in cash in an amount 
equal to 0.60% of the total Tranche 
B commitment, payable on the 
Tranche B closing date. 
    •  If the scheduled maturity date is 
extended beyond June 30, 2022, a 
fee equal to 1% of the total Tranche 
B commitments ( Extension Fee ) 
payable in cash on the date on 
which the extension is made. 
–   It is worth mentioning that, as 
indicated above, given that the 
Tranche B DIP Amendment extends 
to Tranche A the possibility of 
extending the maturity date until 
June 30, 2022, the information 
provided in the material fact dated 
September 17, 2020 is hereby 
supplemented in the sense that 
the Extension Fee  of the Tranche A 
facility would only accrue in the event 
that the scheduled maturity date is 
extended beyond June 30, 2022. 
• In addition, the Tranche B Amendment 
contemplates a Backend Fee payable on the Maturity Date, calculated on 
the total Tranche B commitment at a 
percentage that varies depending on 
the Maturity Date. Such percentage 
shall be (i) 0.5% if it occurs after April 
8, 2022 but on or before April 30, 
2022; (ii) 0.8% if it occurs after April 
30, 2022 but on or before June 30, 
2022; and (iii) 1% if it occurs after June 
30, 2022. 
–   Collateral and Preferences : 
Tranche B will be secured by the 
same assets that currently secure 
Tranche A and Tranche C under the 
DIP Credit Agreement; provided, 
however, that the collateral of 
Tranche A will be senior to the 
collateral of Tranche B, and the 
collateral of Tranche B will be senior 
to the collateral of Tranche C. 
LATAM is awaiting the Court’s decision in 
response to the Tranche B DIP Financing 
Proposal.

MATERIAL FACT of LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A. (“LATAM” or the “Company”), 
Securities Registration No. 306: 
1. Update on LATAM’s Chapter 11 
Proceeding: 
• As previously disclosed, in the context 
of the reorganization proceedings of 
LATAM and certain of its direct and 
indirect subsidiaries (collectively with 
LATAM, the “ Debtors ”) in the United 
States of America (the “ Chapter 11 
Proceeding ”) pursuant to the rules set 
forth in Chapter 11 (the “ Chapter 11 ”) 
of Title 11 of the United States Code 
(the “ U.S. Bankruptcy Code ”), LATAM 
is currently negotiating with various 
interested parties to agree upon the 
terms of a plan of reorganization 
and financing to successfully emerge 
from the Chapter 11 Proceeding in 
compliance with all applicable laws. 
• In the context of these negotiations, 
and as informed by a material 
fact dated September 9, 2021, 
LATAM (i) has entered into non-Our business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
MATERIAL FACTS  
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 133disclosure agreements with various 
stakeholders, and has developed 
and made available to them certain 
material non-public information; and 
(ii) has requested proposals from 
its most significant creditors and 
majority shareholders. 
• In response to requests for proposals, 
as of this date, LATAM has received 
certain non-binding equity and 
debt financing proposals (each such 
proposal, an “ Exit Proposal ”) from 
its most significant creditors and 
majority shareholders. 
• As informed by a material fact dated 
as of the date hereof, pursuant to 
the terms of certain non-disclosure 
agreements and in furtherance of 
the process, on this date, LATAM has 
publicly disclosed the Exit Proposal 
submitted by a group of ad-hoc 
creditors (the “Ad-Hoc Creditor Group”) 
represented by Moelis & Company 
and White & Case LLP (the “Disclosed 
Proposal”), as well as LATAM’s 
Preliminary Issues List (the “Preliminary 
Issues List”) in which the Company 
expressed certain concerns to the 
Ad-Hoc Creditor Group (hereinafter, 
the Disclosed Proposal together with 
LATAM’s Preliminary Issues List  , 
the “Disclosed Information”). The 
Disclosed Information is currently publicly available at https://www.
latamreorganizacion.com/en/
publications/. 
• The Disclosed Proposal contemplates 
the raising of new funds of over 
US$5 billion through the issuance of 
new equity and debt, which would 
be partially backstopped by the 
proposing parties. If the Disclosed 
Proposal were to be approved and 
implemented according to its terms, 
it would result in a substantial dilution 
of LATAM’s currently issued shares.  
• The commercial concerns raised 
by LATAM in its Preliminary Issues 
List reflect the Company’s focus 
on ensuring an appropriate amount 
of leverage and liquidity upon 
exit of the Chapter 11 Proceeding 
and throughout the business plan 
period, as well as compliance with 
all applicable laws including Chilean 
law, in the implementation of the 
plan.  LATAM also identified concerns 
related the lack of detail on most of 
the key financing and backstop terms.  
• LATAM continues to engage with 
significant claimholders and its majority 
shareholders with respect to Exit 
Proposals, and continues to focus on 
ensuring that any exit strategy allows 
it to emerge with a robust capital structure, adequate liquidity, the ability 
to successfully execute its business plan 
in a sustainable manner over time and in 
compliance with all applicable laws.  
• In addition, and without limiting 
the generality of the foregoing, 
LATAM contemplates summoning 
its shareholders to an extraordinary 
shareholders’ meeting when 
appropriate subject to the progress 
of the ongoing negotiations with 
the various stakeholders that are 
currently pending. 
2. LATAM Exclusivity Periods:  
• The Bankruptcy Court for the 
Southern District of New York 
(the “Court”) hearing the Chapter 
11 Proceeding has authorized the 
extension of the period during which 
the Debtors have the exclusive right 
to file the plan of reorganization until 
October 15, 2021, and the exclusive 
right to seek acceptance thereof until 
December 15, 2021 (collectively, the 
“Exclusivity Periods”). 
• In case it is necessary to request 
a new extension of the Exclusivity 
Periods, this will be duly requested 
to the Court and informed to your 
Commission and to the market.  Santiago, October 14, 2021

MATERIAL FACT 
Pursuant to the provisions set forth 
in Article 9 and the second paragraph 
of Article 10 of the Securities Market 
Law, and in General Rule No. 30, duly 
authorized, I hereby report the following 
MATERIAL FACT of LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A. (“ LATAM ” or the “ Company ”), 
Securities Registration No. 306: 
1. In the context of the reorganization 
proceeding of LATAM and certain of 
its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
(collectively with LATAM, the 
“Debtors ”) in the United States of 
America (the “ Chapter 11 Proceeding ”) 
pursuant to the rules set forth in 
Chapter 11 (the “ Chapter 11 ”) of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, on this 
date, the Debtors have filed with the 
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern 
District of New York where the Chapter 
11 Proceeding is pending (the “ Court ”), 
a plan of reorganization and financing 
(the “ Plan of Reorganization ”) which 
contemplates a series of transactions 
in order to successfully emerge 
from the Chapter 11 Proceeding 
in compliance with all applicable 
laws. Such plan, in order to be 
implemented, must first be approved 
by the requisite creditors classes and 
confirmed by the Court in accordance 
with the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 2. The restructuring contemplated in the 
Plan of Reorganization is supported by 
a group of unsecured creditors of LATAM 
represented by Evercore (the “ Evercore  
Represented Creditors ”). Additionally, 
and subject to the confirmation by their 
respective boards, such restructuring 
is also supported by (i) Delta Air Lines, 
Inc.; (ii) Qatar Airways Investment (UK) 
Ltd.; (iii) the Cueto group (i.e., Costa 
Verde Aeronáutica S.A. and Inversiones 
Costa Verde Ltda. y Cía. en Comandita 
Por Acciones); and (iv) the Eblen group 
(i.e., Andes Aérea SpA, Inversiones Pia 
SpA and Comercial Las Vertientes SpA). 
Hereinafter, the parties indicated in (i), 
(ii) and (iii), the “ Backstop Shareholders ”.  
3. The Plan of Reorganization 
contemplates, among other things: 
A. A capital increase from the current 
approximate amount of US$3,146 
million divided into 606,407,693 
common shares to approximately 
the amount of US$13,602 million 
divided into approximately 
606,407,693,000 common shares. This 
capital increase in the approximate 
amount of US$10,456 million will be 
carried out through (i) the issuance 
of new common stock (the “ New 
Common  Stock ”), representing 
approximately US$800 million, and 
(ii) the issuance of shares intended Our business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
MATERIAL FACTS  
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 136Our business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
MATERIAL FACTS  to support the issuance of three 
classes of new convertible notes 
(the “ New Convertible Notes ”) and 
the potential conversion thereof into 
common shares of the Company, 
representing in the aggregate 
approximately US$9,656 million. 
As a consequence of the foregoing, 
and notwithstanding the preemptive 
rights of LATAM’s shareholders 
pursuant to applicable law, according 
to the terms and conditions of the 
Plan of Reorganization, the shares 
currently issued by the Company 
would represent approximately 0.1% 
of the total shares of LATAM after the 
reorganization. 
The New Common Stock will be 
preemptively offered to all of the 
Company’s shareholders, as required 
by current legislation. In addition, it 
should be noted that the placement 
of all of the New Common Stock 
is assured because, subject to the 
execution of commitment letters 
and definitive documentation, (i) the 
Backstop Shareholders have agreed 
to backstop up to US$400 million of 
New Common Stock without being 
entitled to any payment as a result 
of such commitment; and (ii) the 
remaining US$400 million, to the 
extent not subscribed by the remaining 
shareholders’ of LATAM, will be subscribed by the Evercore Represented 
Creditors, who have agreed to backstop 
the placement of the New Common 
Stock for up such amount in exchange 
for a payment of 20% calculated on 
such amount. 
B. The New Convertible Notes 
issuance, in accordance with the 
details indicated below: 
i. New Convertible Notes denominated 
“New Convertible Notes Class A” and 
“New Convertible Notes Class C” to 
be allocated in settlement of certain 
claims against LATAM existing as of 
the date of filing of the voluntary 
petition of relief under Chapter 11, to 
restructure such claims. 
The difference between the two is 
that while the recipients of the New 
Convertible Notes Class A are unsecured 
creditors of LATAM who elect not to 
contribute new money to the Company 
(thereby receiving New Convertible 
Notes Class A in lieu of payment of 
their claims), the recipients of the New 
Class C Convertible Notes are unsecured 
creditors who elect to contribute 
new money, thereby receiving New 
Convertible Notes Class C in exchange for 
a combination of a settlement of their 
claims and a contribution of new money, 
at a rate of approximately US$0.921692 of new money for each US$1 of claims 
(the “ Subscription  Ratio ”).  
As explained further below, the 
aggregate amount of the New 
Convertible Notes Class C is 
approximately US$6,816 million. As 
a result of the Subscription Ratio, 
should this New Convertible Notes 
Class C were subscribed in their 
entirety by unsecured creditors, 
such subscription would require 
(i) a new money contribution of 
approximately US$3,269 million; and 
(ii) a settlement of unsecured claims 
for approximately US$3,547 million. 
It should be added that the Evercore 
Represented Creditors, subject to 
the execution of commitment letters 
and definitive documentation, have 
agreed to backstop the placement of 
the integrity of the New Convertible 
Notes Class C in exchange of a 
payment of 20% calculated over 
the aforementioned new money 
contribution amount of approximately 
US$3,269 million. 
Finally, although the New Convertible 
Notes Class A and the New Convertible 
Notes Class C are structured to be 
delivered in settlement of existing 
claims, they will be preemptively offered 
to LATAM’s shareholders as required by 
applicable law. In the event they are subscribed by such shareholders, the 
unsecured creditors that are otherwise 
beneficiaries thereof may receive in 
lieu of such New Convertible Bonds, 
distributions of the cash obtained from 
such subscription. 
ii. “New Convertible Notes Class B” 
intended to raise new money, which 
will also be preemptively offered to 
all of the Company’s shareholders. 
The placement of these bonds is fully 
backstopped by the Backstopping 
Shareholders, without the right to 
receive any payment in exchange for 
such commitment, subject to the 
execution of commitment letters and 
definitive documentation. 
It is worth noting that the new money 
that will be obtained by the Company 
due to the placement of the New 
Convertible Notes Class B, the New 
Convertible Notes Class C and the 
New Common Stock will amount 
approximately to US$5,442 million. 
C. The incurrence of new debt for 
approximately US$2,250 million and 
a new revolving credit facility for 
approximately US$500 million, which 
will be structured after a competitive 
process in the market in order to 
obtain the best financial conditions 
available at the time of contracting.

INDUSTRY CONTEXT
MATERIAL FACTS  4. With respect to the New Common 
Stock: 
A. Subscription Price : The price at which 
the New Common Stock will be offered 
will reflect a 13.73% discount with 
respect to the equity value of LATAM 
at the consolidated level (“ LATAM’s 
Equity Value ”). However, to the extent 
LATAM’s Equity Value set forth in the 
Plan of Reorganization is amended, 
the subscription price shall also be 
amended. 
B. Placement Mechanics : As indicated, 
these shares will be preemptively 
offered to all of the Company’s 
shareholders during the respective 
preemptive rights offering period 
(the “ First POP ”). The Backstop 
Shareholders have agreed to subscribe 
their respective pro-rata in the 
First POP without being entitled to 
any payment resulting from such 
commitment. In the event that after 
the expiration of the First POP, New 
Common Stock is still available, such 
stock will be preemptively offered 
to all shareholders of the Company 
who have participated in the First 
POP (including, without limitation, 
the Backstop Shareholders and other 
LATAM shareholders). As mentioned 
above, subject to the execution of 
binding commitment letters and definitive documentation, the Backstop 
Shareholders have agreed to backstop 
up to US$400 million of the New 
Common Stock without being entitled 
to any payment as a result of such 
commitment; provided, however, that 
the aggregate amount of shares that 
the Backstop Shareholders will have in 
LATAM as a result of the subscription 
of New Common Stock and the 
exercise of the conversion option of 
the New Convertible Notes Class B, 
shall not exceed 27% of the capital of 
the reorganized Company. 
Finally, in the event that after the 
foregoing, New Common Stock is still 
available, the remainder will be subscribed 
by the Evercore Represented Creditors 
up to the amount of US$400 million, 
who have assumed such commitment in 
exchange for a payment of 20% calculated 
on such amount, subject to the execution 
of binding commitment letters and 
definitive documentation. 
5. With respect to the New Convertible 
Notes Class A: 
A. Amount of the Issue : Approximate

amended, such conversion ratio shall 
also be amended.  
However, the conversion ratio shall 
decrease by 50% in the event that the 
conversion option is exercised after 
the 60th day after the date on which 
the Plan of Reorganization becomes 
effective (the “ Effective Date ”). 
E. Distribution of New Convertible 
Notes Class A :To the extent that the 
New Convertible Notes Class A are 
not subscribed by the Company’s 
shareholders during the respective 
preemptive rights offering period, the 
Plan of Reorganization contemplates 
that they will be allocated to 
unsecured creditors who do not opt 
to participate in the New Convertible 
Notes Class C, in settlement of their 
claims. It should be added that the 
Backstop Shareholders have agreed 
to waive their respective preemptive 
rights to subscribe for these 
instruments. 6. With respect to the New Convertible 
Notes Class C: 
A. Amount of the Issue : Approximate 
amount of US$6,816 million, which to 
the extent fully subscribed by unsecured 
creditors would require (i) a new 
money contribution of approximately 
US$3,269 million; and (ii) acceptance 
of a settlement of their claims for 
approximately US$3,547 million. 
B. Maturity Date : Payable in a single 
installment on December 31, 2121. 
C. Interest : No interest will accrue. 
D. Conversion Ratio : Conversion ratio 
of New Convertible Bonds Class C into 
shares of the Company at a ratio of 
0.705506x; provided, however, that to

also be amended.  
However, the conversion ratio will 
decrease by 50% in case the conversion 
option is exercised after the 60th day 
from the Effective Date. 
E. Distribution of New Convertible 
Notes Class C : To the extent that 
the New Convertible Notes Class C 
are not subscribed by the Company’s

Appendices 138Our business
INDUSTRY CONTEXT
MATERIAL FACTS  shareholders during the respective 
preemptive rights offering period, the 
Plan of Reorganization contemplates 
that they will be subscribed by 
unsecured creditors who opt to 
participate in the New Convertible 
Notes Class C in exchange of (i) a 
settlement of their claims; and (ii) a 
new money contribution pursuant to 
the Subscription Ratio. It should be 
added that the Backstop Shareholders 
have agreed to waive their respective 
preemptive rights to subscribe for 
these instruments. 
7.  With respect to the New Convertible 
Notes Class B: 
A. Amount of the Issue : Approximate 
amount of US$1,373 million in new 
money. 
B. Maturity Date : Payable in a single 
installment on December 31, 2121. 
C. Interest : Interest shall accrue payable 
in cash at a rate of 1% per annum; 
provided, however, that no interest shall 
accrue during the first 60 days from the 
Effective Date. 
D. Conversion Ratio : Conversion ratio 
of New Convertible Bonds Class B into 
shares of the Company at a ratio of 
1.159152x; provided, however, that to the extent LATAM’s Equity Value set 
forth in the Plan of Reorganization is 
amended, such conversion ratio shall 
also be amended. This conversion ratio 
implies an implicit price per share equal 
to that of the New Common Stock.  
However, the conversion ratio will 
decrease by 50% in the event that the 
conversion option is exercised after the 
fourth anniversary date plus 60 days 
from the Effective Date. 
E. Lock-up Period : In the event that the 
conversion option is exercised within 60 
days after the Effective Date, the shares 
received as a result of the conversion 
may not be transferred until the fourth 
anniversary from the Effective Date; 
provided, however, that such shares 
could be subjected to encumbrances 
during such period. 
F. Subscription of New Convertible 
Notes Class B : To the extent that the 
New Convertible Notes Class B are not 
subscribed by the Company’s minority 
shareholders during the respective 
preemptive rights period, they will 
be subscribed in their entirety by 
the Backstop Shareholders in their 
capacity as strategic shareholders, 
who have agreed to fully backstop 
the placement of the New Convertible 
Notes Class B that are not subscribed by the remaining shareholders of 
the Company, not demanding any 
backstop payment in exchange for 
such commitment. 
8. The Plan of Reorganization also 
contemplates that LATAM’s bylaws 
will be amended so that, during the 
two years following the Effective Date, 
the approval of any of the matters 
contemplated in Article 67 of Law No. 
18,046 will require the affirmative vote 
of 73% of the voting shares, instead 
of two-thirds of the voting shares as 
provided therein. 
9. In addition, the Plan of 
Reorganization also contemplates a 
number of customary elements for 
these type of transactions, including 
(i) the establishment of an incentive 
plan for the management of LATAM, 
the terms and conditions of which are 
to be determined; and (ii) the payment 
in full of the debtor-in-possession 
financing granted to the Company 
in the context of the Chapter 11 
Proceeding with the new funds raised 
in connection with the transactions 
contemplated under the Plan of 
Reorganization. 10. As is customary in this type of 
restructuring, the various creditors 
and interest holders in the Chapter 11 
Proceeding have been divided in the 
Plan of Reorganization into different 
classes. Some of these creditors or 
interest holders have been grouped into 
classes that are not impaired by the 
Plan of Reorganization because it is 
contemplated that their claims will be 
refinanced, paid, or otherwise treated in 
an unimpaired manner. Under the rules 
of Chapter 11, these interested parties 
are presumed to accept the Plan of 
Reorganization. On the other hand, there 
are other creditors and stakeholders 
that are grouped into classes that will be 
impaired by the Plan of Reorganization 
because their claims are restructured 
under the Plan of Reorganization. Under 
the rules of Chapter 11, these classes 
of interested parties will be entitled to 
vote, accepting or rejecting the Plan of 
Reorganization. 
11. If the Plan of Reorganization is 
approved by the requisite creditor 
vote, confirmed by the Court and 
implemented, it will enable the 
Debtors to emerge from the Chapter 
11 Proceeding with a robust capital 
structure, with adequate liquidity and 
will allow the Company to successfully 
execute its business plan in a 
sustainable manner over time.

Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 141The following important factors, and 
those important factors described 
in other reports we submit to or file 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (“SEC”), could affect our 
actual results and could cause our 
actual results to differ materially from 
those expressed in any forward-looking 
statements made by us or on our 
behalf. In particular, as we are a non-
U.S. company, there are risks associated 
with investing in our ADSs that are not 
typical for investments in the shares 
of U.S. companies. Prior to making 
an investment decision, you should 
carefully consider all of the information 
contained in this document, including 
the following risk factors.RISKS RELATING TO OUR CHAPTER 11 
PROCEEDINGS
We and a substantial number of our 
consolidated subsidiaries filed voluntary 
petitions for relief under Chapter 11 
of the Bankruptcy Code, and we are 
subject to the risks and uncertainties 
associated with our Chapter 11 
proceedings.
As a consequence of our Chapter 11 
filings, the operations and our ability 
to develop and execute our business 
plan, as well as our continuation as a 
going concern, will be subject to the 
risks and uncertainties associated with 
bankruptcy. These risks include our 
ability to:
• confirm and consummate a plan of 
reorganization with respect to our 
Chapter 11 proceedings;
• obtain sufficient financing, 
including for working capital 
whether from additional debtor-
in-possession financing, exit 
financing or otherwise, and emerge 
from bankruptcy and execute our 
business plan post-emergence, as 
well as comply with the terms and 
conditions of that financing;
• maintain our relationships with our 
creditors, suppliers, service providers, customers, directors, officers and 
employees; and
• maintain contracts that are critical 
to our operations on reasonably 
acceptable terms and conditions.
We will also be subject to risks relating 
to, among others:
• the high costs of bankruptcy 
proceedings and related fees;
• the ability of third parties to seek and 
obtain court approval to (i) terminate 
contracts and other agreements 
with us, (ii) shorten the exclusivity 
period for us to propose and confirm 
a Chapter 11 plan or to appoint a 
Chapter 11 trustee or (iii) convert the 
Chapter 11 proceedings to Chapter 7 
liquidation proceedings; and
• the actions and decisions of our 
creditors and other third parties who 
have interests in our Chapter 11 
proceedings that may be inconsistent 
with our plans.
Any delays in our Chapter 11 
proceedings increase the risks of our 
inability to reorganize our business 
and emerge from bankruptcy and may 
increase our costs associated with the 
reorganization process.Our business
FINANCIAL RESULTS
RISK FACTORS
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 142Because of the many risks and 
uncertainties associated with a 
voluntary filing for relief under Chapter 
11 and the related proceedings, we 
cannot accurately predict or quantify the 
ultimate impact that events that occur 
during our Chapter 11 proceedings may 
have on us and there is no certainty 
as to our ability to continue as a going 
concern.
It is impossible to predict with certainty 
the amount of time that we could spend 
in our Chapter 11 proceedings or to 
assure parties in interest that a plan 
of reorganization will be confirmed. 
Our Chapter 11 proceedings may 
involve additional expense and our 
management will be required to spend 
a significant amount of time and effort 
focusing on the Chapter 11 proceedings.
On September 19, 2020, the Bankruptcy 
Court entered an order approving the 
Debtors’ motion to approve certain 
debtor-in-possession financing 
consisting of a Tranche A facility in 
an amount of up to US$1.3 billion, 
and an initial Tranche C facility in an 
amount of up to US$1.15 billion. On 
October 18, 2021, the Bankruptcy 
Court entered an order approving the 
Debtor’s motion for additional debtor-
in-possession financing consisting of 
a Tranche B facility in an amount of up to US$750 million. Among other things, 
the Tranche B facility provided certain 
improved pricing terms and conditions 
as compared to the pricing conditions of 
the existing Tranche A and C facilities.
On November 26, 2021, the Debtors 
filed the Plan of Reorganization 
and entered into the RSA and, on 
January 12, 2022 entered into the 
Backstop Agreements. We cannot 
predict whether the Plan will be 
confirmed. If the Plan is not confirmed 
and we have to renegotiate a new 
plan of reorganization, our Chapter 
11 proceedings may take longer to 
conclude, which may adversely impact 
our ability to reorganize our business 
and emerge from bankruptcy.
Our Plan of Reorganization provides that 
we may refinance certain of our existing 
obligations and that we may also 
seek additional exit financing to repay 
certain other existing obligations and 
to fund our operations. Our Chapter 11 
proceedings may also make it necessary 
for us to seek additional debtor-in-
possession financing to fund operations, 
particularly if there are significant 
delays in our Chapter 11 proceedings. If 
we are unable to obtain such financing 
on favorable terms or at all, our chances 
of successfully reorganizing our business 
may be seriously jeopardized and the likelihood that we instead will be 
required to liquidate our assets may be 
increased, and, as a result, our common 
shares and debt instruments could 
become further devalued or become 
worthless. 
Furthermore, we cannot predict the 
ultimate amount of all settlement 
terms for the liabilities that will be 
subject to our plan of reorganization. 
Even once a plan of reorganization is 
approved and implemented, we may 
be adversely affected by the possible 
reluctance of prospective lenders and 
other counterparties to do business with 
a company that has recently emerged 
from Chapter 11 proceedings.
We have substantial liquidity needs 
and may not be able to obtain 
sufficient liquidity to confirm a plan of 
reorganization and exit our Chapter 11 
proceedings successfully.
Although we have taken multiple 
measures to reduce our expenses 
and have reduced the scale of our 
operations significantly, mainly as 
a result of developments relating to 
the spread of COVID-19, our business 
remains capital intensive. In addition 
to the cash requirements necessary to 
fund our ongoing operations, we have 
incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with our 
reorganization, and we expect that 
we will continue to incur significant 
professional fees and costs throughout 
our Chapter 11 proceedings. There 
are no assurances that our liquidity 
is sufficient to allow us to satisfy our 
obligations related to our Chapter 
11 proceedings, to proceed with the 
confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan 
of reorganization and to emerge 
successfully from our Chapter 11 
proceedings. Notably, as discussed 
below, to confirm a Chapter 11 plan 
of reorganization, we will have to 
demonstrate feasibility which will in 
part rely on our ability to demonstrate 
sufficient liquidity upon emergence.
We can provide no assurance that we 
will be able to secure additional interim 
financing or exit financing sufficient to 
meet our liquidity needs. Our liquidity, 
including our ability to meet our 
ongoing operational obligations and 
the covenants, milestones and other 
conditions in our debt instruments, is 
dependent upon, among other things: 
(i) our ability to comply with the terms 
and conditions of the cash management 
order entered by the Bankruptcy Court 
in connection with our Chapter 11 
proceedings, (ii) our ability to maintain 
adequate cash on hand, (iii) our ability 
to generate positive cash flow from Our business

factors beyond our control relating 
to developments deriving from the 
spread of COVID-19, (iv) our ability to 
confirm and consummate a Chapter 
11 plan of reorganization and (v) the 
cost, duration and outcome of the 
Chapter 11 proceedings.
We may not be able to obtain 
confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of 
reorganization or such confirmation 
may be protracted and delayed.1
To emerge successfully from Bankruptcy 
Court protection as a viable entity, 
we must meet certain statutory 
requirements. On March 21, 2022, the 
Bankruptcy Court entered an order 
approving the disclosure statement 
regarding the proposed Plan of 
Reorganization, and corresponding 
solicitation materials, finding that 
the disclosure statement contained 
adequate information and permitting 
solicitation to commence (the 
“Disclosure Statement Order”). Pursuant 
to the Disclosure Statement Order, the 
Debtors are obligated to commence 
solicitation of its Plan of Reorganization 
within five business days after entry of 
the Disclosure Statement Order.
Notwithstanding the approval of the 
disclosure statement, we will still have to obtain the requisite acceptances of 
our plan and demonstrate the feasibility 
of our plan to the Bankruptcy Court by a 
preponderance of the evidence in order 
to fulfill other statutory conditions for 
confirmation of our plan. To date, and 
as described herein, although we have 
filed a proposed plan of reorganization, 
there can be no assurance as to whether 
parties in interest will seek to challenge 
confirmation of the plan, and as to 
when or whether the Bankruptcy Court 
will approve the Plan of Reorganization. 
Moreover, certain parties in interest 
have sought relief from the Bankruptcy 
Court which, if granted, could materially 
affect the Plan and the transactions 
contemplated therein. Similarly, just 
as we cannot assure that a plan of 
reorganization will be approved by the 
Bankruptcy Court, we cannot guarantee 
that such plan will be recognized or 
approved by the courts in the other 
jurisdictions in which we operated 
and/or where we are subject to the 
parallel and ancillary reorganization 
proceedings, or whether or when we will 
be able to emerge from such parallel or 
ancillary proceedings.
In particular, the confirmation 
process can be subject to numerous 
unanticipated potential delays. The risks 
include the possibility that:• We may receive objections to 
confirmation of any plan of 
reorganization from various 
stakeholders in our Chapter 
11 proceedings, including the 
effectiveness and effect of the steps 
required for the implementation 
of the Plan, which could delay and 
disrupt confirmation of the Plan 
and the Debtors’ emergence from 
bankruptcy. Any litigation may be 
expensive, lengthy and disruptive 
to the company’s normal business 
operations and the plan confirmation 
process. We cannot predict the 
impact that any objection or third 
party motion during our Chapter 
11 proceedings may have on the 
Bankruptcy Court’s decision to confirm 
a plan of reorganization or our ability 
to complete a plan of reorganization. A 
resolution of any such litigation that is 
unfavorable to the Debtors could have 
a material adverse effect on the plan 
confirmation process, emergence from 
bankruptcy or on LATAM’s businesses, 
results of operations, financial 
condition, liquidity and cash flow.
• Adverse publicity in connection 
with the Chapter 11 proceedings or 
otherwise could negatively affect 
LATAM’s business both during the 
proceedings, the plan confirmation 
process and post-emergence.Counterparties to assumed and 
assigned contracts may object to the 
assignment of such contracts pursuant 
to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
Section 365(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy 
Code provides that a contract may not 
be assumed or assigned if applicable 
nonbankruptcy law so provides. 
While the Debtors do not believe that 
applicable nonbankruptcy law voids 
any of the Debtors’ assignments, a 
counterparty may nevertheless object 
to an assignment on such grounds.
The success of any reorganization will 
depend on approval by the Bankruptcy 
Court and the willingness of our 
creditors to agree to the exchange or 
modification of their claims as will be 
outlined in a plan of reorganization, 
and there can be no guarantee of 
success with respect to any plan of 
reorganization.
If a plan of reorganization is not 
confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court or 
the courts in the other jurisdictions in 
which we are subject to reorganization 
proceedings, or if we are unable to 
emerge from any of our reorganization 
proceedings, it is unclear whether or 
when we would be able to reorganize our 
business and what, if any, distributions 
holders of claims against us, including 
holders of our secured and unsecured Our business

Appendices 144debt and equity, would ultimately 
receive with respect to their claims. 
There can be no assurance as to 
whether or when we will successfully 
reorganize and emerge from our Chapter 
11 proceedings or, if we do successfully 
reorganize, as to when we would emerge 
from Chapter 11 proceedings. If no plan 
of reorganization can be confirmed, 
or the Bankruptcy Court finds that 
it would be in the best interest of 
creditors, the Bankruptcy Court may 
convert or dismiss our Chapter 11 
proceedings to cases under Chapter 7 
of the Bankruptcy Code. In the event of 
conversion, a Chapter 7 trustee would 
be appointed or elected to liquidate our 
assets for distribution in accordance 
with the priorities established by the 
Bankruptcy Code.
Any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization 
that we may implement will be based 
in large part upon assumptions and 
analyses developed by us. If these 
assumptions and analyses prove to be 
incorrect, our plan may be unsuccessful 
in its execution.
Any plan of reorganization we may 
implement could affect our capital 
structure and the ownership, structure 
and operation of the business and will 
reflect assumptions and analyses based 
on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions 
and expected future developments, as 
well as other factors that we consider 
appropriate under the circumstances. 
Whether actual future results and 
developments will be consistent with 
our expectations and assumptions 
depends on a number of factors, 
including but not limited to: (i) our 
ability to change substantially our 
capital structure, (ii) our ability to 
obtain adequate liquidity and access 
financing sources, (iii) our ability to 
maintain customers’ confidence in our 
viability as a going concern, (iv) our 
ability to retain key employees and 
(v) the overall strength and stability of 
general macroeconomic conditions. In 
light of the many uncertainties and risks 
deriving from developments relating 
to the spread of COVID-19 and new 
variants, these factors and their effect 
on us are highly unpredictable.
In addition, any Chapter 11 plan of 
reorganization will rely upon financial 
projections that are necessarily 
speculative, and it is possible that 
one or more of the assumptions and 
estimates that are the basis of these 
financial forecasts will not result as 
expected. In our case, the forecasts 
may be even more speculative 
than normal because of the many 
uncertainties we face relating to, among others, macroeconomic conditions 
in the countries in which the group 
operates, depressed demand for air 
travel and travel restrictions imposed 
by governments as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and the time and 
manner in which COVID-19 vaccines 
are distributed in the countries in 
which the group operates. Accordingly, 
our actual financial condition and 
results of operations could differ, 
perhaps materially, from what we 
have anticipated. Consequently, there 
can be no assurance that the results 
or developments contemplated by 
any plan of reorganization we may 
implement will occur or, even if they 
do occur, that they will have the 
anticipated effects on us or our business 
or operations. The failure of any such 
results or developments to materialize 
as anticipated could materially and 
adversely affect the successful 
execution of any plan of reorganization.
Upon emergence from a filing of 
voluntary relief under Chapter 11 of 
the Bankruptcy Code, our historical 
financial information may not be 
indicative of our future financial 
performance.
Our capital structure may be 
significantly altered under a plan 
of reorganization. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change 
the amounts and classifications 
reported in our consolidated historical 
financial statements, which do not 
give effect to any adjustments to the 
carrying value of assets or amounts of 
liabilities that might be necessary as 
a consequence of confirmation of the 
reorganization plan.
Even if a Chapter 11 plan of 
reorganization is confirmed, we may not 
be able to achieve the effective date.
It is common for plans of reorganization 
to contain conditions precedent to 
effectiveness, such as obtaining 
government approvals, satisfying any 
conditions precedent in the exit facility 
and entry of an order approving the 
plan. Even upon confirmation of a plan, 
there can be no assurance as to when 
such conditions will be satisfied, if at all.
Operating in bankruptcy imposes 
significant risks on the Debtors’ 
operations. Although the Debtors 
believe that the effective date of the 
Plan will occur in the second half of 
2022, there can be no assurance as to 
such timing or that the conditions to 
the effective date will ever be satisfied, 
including without limitation: (i) entry of 
the confirmation order confirming the 
Plan by the Bankruptcy Court in form Our business
FINANCIAL RESULTS
RISK FACTORS
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 145and substance reasonably satisfactory 
to the Debtors, and not having been 
stayed or reversed or vacated on appeal 
and (ii) the satisfaction (or waiver in 
accordance with the terms therein) of 
the conditions precedent for the closing 
of the exit financing.
Even if a Chapter 11 plan of 
reorganization is consummated, we may 
not be able to achieve our stated goals 
and continue as a going concern.
Even if a Chapter 11 plan of 
reorganization is consummated, we 
will continue to face a number of risks, 
including further depressed demand 
for air travel and challenging economic 
conditions as a result of developments 
relating to the spread of COVID-19 
or otherwise. Accordingly, we cannot 
guarantee that a Chapter 11 plan of 
reorganization will achieve our stated 
goals and permit us to effectively 
implement our strategy.
Furthermore, even if our debts are 
reduced or discharged through a plan 
of reorganization, we may need to 
raise additional funds through public 
or private debt or equity financing or 
other various means to fund the group’s 
business after the completion of our Chapter 11 proceedings. Our access to 
additional financing for the foreseeable 
future will likely continue to be limited, 
if it is available at all. Therefore, 
adequate funds may not be available 
when needed or may not be available on 
favorable terms.
We may be subject to claims that 
will not be discharged in our Chapter 
11 proceedings, which could have a 
material adverse effect on our financial 
condition and results of operations. 
The Bankruptcy Code provides that 
the confirmation of a Chapter 11 
plan of reorganization discharges a 
debtor from substantially all debts 
arising prior to confirmation. With 
few exceptions, all claims that arose 
prior to confirmation of the plan of 
reorganization: (i) would be subject to 
compromise and/or treatment under 
the plan of reorganization and (ii) would 
be discharged in accordance with the 
Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the 
plan of reorganization. Any claims not 
ultimately discharged through a Chapter 
11 plan of reorganization could be 
asserted against the reorganized entities 
and may have an adverse effect on the 
business and financial condition and 
results of operations of the group on a 
post-reorganization basis.Our Chapter 11 proceedings may 
adversely affect our ability to maintain 
important relationships with creditors, 
customers, suppliers, employees, 
financing sources and other personnel 
and counterparties, which could 
materially and adversely affect us.
Our Chapter 11 proceedings may 
adversely affect our commercial 
relationships and our ability to negotiate 
favorable terms with important 
stakeholders and counterparties, 
including potential sources of financing. 
Further, public perception of our 
continued viability may also adversely 
affect our relationships with customers 
and their loyalty to us. Strains in any 
of these relationships could materially 
and adversely affect us. In particular, 
critical suppliers, credit and debit 
card processors and acquirers, banks, 
export credit agencies, providers of 
letters of credit, surety bonds or similar 
instruments, vendors, lessors and 
customers may determine not to do 
business with us due to our Chapter 11 
proceedings. Also, during the pendency 
of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the 
court has stayed the enforcement of 
any payment toward debt obligations 
and we will need the prior approval of 
the Bankruptcy Court for transactions 
outside the ordinary course of business, 
which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take 
advantage of certain opportunities.
There is uncertainty regarding our 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our audited consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on the 
basis of accounting principles applicable 
to a going concern. As discussed above, 
our ability to continue as a going 
concern is contingent upon, among other 
things, our ability to: (i) develop and 
successfully implement a restructuring 
plan within the timeframe required, (ii) 
reduce debt and other liabilities through 
the restructuring process, (iii) generate 
sufficient cash flow from operations and 
(iv) obtain financing sources to meet our 
future obligations. The accompanying 
consolidated financial statements also 
do not include any adjustments that 
might be necessary should we be unable 
to continue as a going concern.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY
A pandemic or the widespread outbreak 
of contagious illnesses has had, and 
may continue to have, a material 
adverse effect on the group’s business 
and results of operations.
The widespread outbreak of a 
contagious illness such as the COVID-19 Our business
FINANCIAL RESULTS
RISK FACTORS
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 146pandemic, or fear of such an event, has 
materially reduced, and may continue 
to further reduce, demand for, and 
availability of, worldwide air travel and 
therefore is having a material adverse 
effect on the group’s business and 
results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has 
negatively affected global economic 
conditions, disrupted supply chains and 
otherwise negatively impacted aircraft 
manufacturing operations and may 
reduce the availability of aircraft spare 
parts. The ultimate severity of the 
COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain at this 
time and therefore we cannot predict the 
impact it may have on the availability of 
aircraft or aircraft spare parts. However, 
the effect on our results may be material 
and adverse if supply chain disruptions 
persist and preclude our ability to 
adequately maintain our fleet.
The potential for a period of significantly 
reduced demand for travel has and will 
likely continue to result in significant 
lost revenue. As a result of these or 
other conditions beyond our control, 
our results of operations could continue 
to be volatile and subject to rapid and 
unexpected change. In addition, if the 
spread of COVID-19 were to continue 
unabated, our operations could also be 
negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to 
the contagious illness. We cannot fully 
predict the impact that the COVID-19 
pandemic will continue to have on 
global air travel, corporate travel, and 
the extent to which it may impact the 
demand for air travel in the regions in 
which the group operates. Continued 
government-imposed travel restrictions, 
border closures or operational issues 
resulting from the rapid spread of 
COVID-19 or other contagious illnesses, 
all of which may be unpredictable, 
may materially reduce demand for air 
travel in parts of the world in which we 
have significant operations and could 
have lasting impacts on how people do 
business and the need or demand for 
business travel. In addition, the pace of 
the COVID-19 vaccine rollout globally 
may materially impact our operations. 
These measures and issues have had 
and could continue to have a material 
adverse effect on the group’s business 
and results of operations.
It is possible that in spite of mitigation 
measures in place, COVID-19 or other 
diseases could be transmitted to 
passengers or employees on our aircraft 
or at an airport, which could lead to 
reputational and/ or financial impacts.
The health safety and sanitation 
measures we have implemented as a group may not be sufficient to prevent 
the spread or contagion of COVID-19 
or other infectious diseases to our 
passengers or employees on our aircraft 
or the airports in which we operate, 
which could result in adverse reputational 
and financial impacts for the group. For 
further information on the health safety 
and sanitation measures implemented by 
the group, see section Safety. However, 
it is possible that these measures could 
prove insufficient and COVID-19 or 
other diseases could be transmitted to 
passengers or employees in an airport or 
on an aircraft.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the airline industry may experience 
consumer behavior changes with regard 
to corporate travel, long-haul travel, 
and travel demand.
The potential for mid- to long-term 
changes to consumer behavior resulting 
from the COVID-19 pandemic exists 
and could lead to adverse financial 
impacts for the Company. Corporate 
travel has been hindered, and in many 
cases, prohibited by companies due to 
risks during the pandemic. At this time, 
it is not possible to predict the potential 
consequences of the increased use of 
technology as a substitute for travel and 
whether or when corporate travel, long-
haul travel and travel demand could return to the levels existing prior to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, 
travelers may be less prone to travel 
or be more price conscious and may 
choose low-cost alternatives as a result 
of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A failure to successfully implement the 
group’s strategy or a failure to adjust 
such strategy to the current economic 
situation would harm the group’s 
business and the market value of our 
ADSs and common shares.
We have developed a strategic plan 
with the goal of becoming one of the 
most admired airlines in the world and 
renewing our commitment to sustained 
profitability and superior returns to 
shareholders. Our strategy requires 
us to identify value propositions that 
are attractive to our clients, to find 
efficiencies in our daily operations, 
and to transform ourselves into a 
stronger and more risk-resilient 
company. A tenet of our strategic 
plan is the continuing adoption of a 
new travel model for domestic and 
international services to address the 
changing dynamics of customers 
and the industry, and to increase our 
competitiveness. The new travel model 
is based on a continued reduction in air 
fares that makes air travel accessible 
to a wider audience, and in particular to Our business
FINANCIAL RESULTS
RISK FACTORS
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 147those who wish to fly more frequently. 
This model requires continued cost 
reduction efforts and increasing 
revenues from ancillary activities. In 
connection with these efforts, the 
Company continues to implement a 
series of initiatives to reduce cost 
per ASK in all its operations as well 
as developing new ancillary revenue 
initiatives.
Difficulties in implementing our strategy 
may adversely affect the group’s business, 
results of operation and the market value 
of our ADSs and common shares.
Our financial results are exposed to 
foreign currency fluctuations.
We prepare and present our 
consolidated financial statements in 
U.S. dollars. LATAM and its affiliates 
operate in numerous countries and face 
the risk of variation in foreign currency 
exchange rates against the U.S. dollar or 
between the currencies of these various 
countries. Changes in the exchange 
rate between the U.S. dollar and the 
currencies in the countries in which 
the group operates could adversely 
affect the business, financial condition 
and results of operations. If the value 
of the Brazilian real, Chilean peso or 
other currencies in which revenues are 
denominated declines against the U.S. dollar, our results of operations and 
financial condition will be affected. 
The exchange rate of the Chilean peso, 
Brazilian real and other currencies 
against the U.S. dollar may fluctuate 
significantly in the future.
Changes in Chilean, Brazilian and 
other governmental economic policies 
affecting foreign exchange rates could 
also adversely affect the business, 
financial condition, results of operations 
and the return to our shareholders on 
their common shares or ADSs.
The group depends on strategic alliances 
or commercial relationships in many 
different countries, and the business 
may suffer if any of our strategic 
alliances or commercial relationships 
terminates.
We maintain a number of alliances and 
other commercial relationships in many 
of the jurisdictions in which LATAM and 
its affiliates operate. These alliances 
or commercial relationships allow us 
to enhance our network and, in some 
cases, to offer our customers services 
that we could not otherwise offer. If any 
of our strategic alliances or commercial 
relationships deteriorate, or any of these 
agreements are terminated, the group’s 
business, financial condition and results of 
operations could be adversely affected.The group’s business and results of 
operations may suffer if we fail to 
obtain and maintain routes, suitable 
airport access, slots and other operating 
permits. Also, technical and operational 
problems with the airport infrastructure 
of cities in which we have a focus may 
have a material adverse effect on us.
LATAM’s business depends upon our 
access to key routes and airports. 
Bilateral aviation agreements between 
countries, open skies laws and local 
aviation approvals frequently involve 
political and other considerations 
outside of our control. The group’s 
operations could be constrained by any 
delay or inability to gain access to key 
routes or airports, including:
• limitations on our ability to transport 
more passengers;
• the imposition of flight capacity 
restrictions;
• the inability to secure or maintain 
route rights in local markets or under 
bilateral agreements; or
• the inability to maintain our existing 
slots and obtain additional slots.
The group operates numerous 
international routes subject to bilateral agreements, as well as domestic flights 
within Chile, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador and 
Colombia, subject to local route and 
airport access approvals.
There can be no assurance that existing 
bilateral agreements with the countries 
in which the group’s companies are 
based and permits from foreign 
governments will continue to be in 
effect. A modification, suspension or 
revocation of one or more bilateral 
agreements could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 
The suspension of our permission 
to operate at certain airports, 
destinations or slots, or the imposition 
of other sanctions could also have a 
material adverse effect. A change in 
the administration of current laws and 
regulations or the adoption of new laws 
and regulations in any of the countries 
in which the group operates that 
restrict our routes, airports or other 
access may have a material adverse 
effect on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations.
Moreover, our operations and growth 
strategy are dependent on the facilities 
and infrastructure of key airports, 
including Santiago’s International Airport, 
São Paulo’s Guarulhos International 
and Congonhas Airports, Brasilia’s Our business

Appendices 148International Airport and Lima’s Jorge 
Chavez International Airport. Airports 
may face challenges to meet their capex 
programs, after suffering significant 
financial deterioration stemming from 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Delays or 
cancellations of capex programs could 
impact our operations or ability to grow 
in the future.
Santiago’s Comodoro Arturo Merino 
Benítez International Airport is 
undergoing an important expansion, 
which was expected to be completed 
by 2021, but opened in February 2022. 
There is currently a dispute between the 
airport operator and the government 
arising from the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic and deceleration of airport 
operations on revenues, which placed 
additional stress on the operator’s 
liquidity in light of ongoing investments 
required for the expansion project. In 
order to mitigate the impact of the 
financial loss, the current operator 
is requesting an extension of the 
concession period, which expires in 2035. 
This dispute implies a risk to future opex 
and capex investments and adverse 
effects to the airport’s operations.
Santiago’s Comodoro Arturo Merino 
Benítez International Airport opened 
its expansion at the end of February 
2022. One of the most challenging issues with the new terminal is that 
the check-in process considers a 50% 
reduction in assisted check-in counters, 
which obligates airlines to implement 
self-service models, where the success 
depends on the companies but is 
also associated with the government 
restrictions of the destination country.
One of the major operational risks we 
have faced on a daily basis at Lima’s 
Jorge Chavez International Airport is the 
limited number of parking positions. 
Additionally, the indoor infrastructure of 
the airport limits our ability to manage 
connections and launch new flights 
due to the lack of gates and increasing 
security and immigration controls. 
Lima’s Jorge Chavez International Airport 
is currently undergoing an expansion, 
which is expected to be completed by 
2024. Any delays or limitations due 
to the ongoing works could negatively 
impact our operations, limit our ability 
to grow and affect our competitiveness 
in the country and in the region.
Brazilian airports, such as the Brasilia 
and São Paulo (Guarulhos) International 
Airports, have limited the number of 
takeoff and landing slots per day due 
to infrastructural limitations.] Any 
condition that would prevent or delay 
our access to airports or routes that 
are vital to our strategy, or our ability to maintain our existing slots and 
obtain additional slots, could materially 
adversely affect our operations.
One of the largest operational risks 
that the El Dorado International Airport 
in Bogotá faces is the limited capacity 
that it has during certain time periods 
due to the adverse weather conditions, 
the operation of non-regular flights 
and the lack of availability of slots. 
As a result, measures have been 
implemented to mitigate and regulate 
the operation, such as Ground Stop and 
Ground Delay Program (GDP Program), 
which generates delays controlled by 
the control tower. Another issue faced 
at the El Dorado International Airport 
is delays by ATC of the control tower 
in connection with the GDP Program. 
These delays occur particularly in 
certain time periods with high traffic 
and are associated with non-regular 
flight operation, emergency flights, 
lower performance planes, all of which 
lower the airport’s capacity. However, 
the El Dorado Airport, its concessionaire, 
Opain S.A., and the relevant authorities 
are working on the ACDM (Airport 
Collaborative Decision Making) project 
which seeks to optimize the airport’s 
resources, involving all the industry’s 
players by understanding their needs, 
in order to achieve a more controlled 
operation with less schedule delays.A significant portion of our cargo 
revenue comes from relatively few 
product types and may be impacted by 
events affecting their production, trade 
or demand.
The group’s cargo demand, especially 
from Latin American exporters, is 
concentrated in a small number of 
product categories, such as exports of 
fish, sea products and fruits from Chile, 
asparagus from Peru and fresh flowers 
from Ecuador and Colombia. Events 
that adversely affect the production, 
trade or demand for these goods may 
adversely affect the volume of goods 
that are transported and may have a 
significant impact on the results of 
operations. Future trade protection 
measures by or against the countries 
for which we provide cargo services may 
have an impact on cargo traffic volumes 
and adversely affect our financial 
results. Some of the cargo products 
are sensitive to foreign exchange rates 
and, therefore, traffic volumes could 
be impacted by the appreciation or 
depreciation of local currencies.
Our operations are subject to fluctuations 
in the supply and cost of jet fuel, which 
could adversely impact our business.

of operations. Jet fuel costs have 
historically accounted for a significant 
amount of our operating expenses, 
and accounted for 30.0% of our total 
costs of sales in 2021. Both the cost 
and availability of fuel are subject to 
many economic and political factors 
and events that we can neither control 
nor predict, including international 
political and economic circumstances 
such as the political instability in major 
oil-exporting countries. Any future 
fuel supply shortage (for example, as a 
result of production curtailments by the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries, or “OPEC”), a disruption of 
oil imports, supply disruptions resulting 
from severe weather or natural disasters, 
labor actions such as the 2018 trucking 
strike in Brazil, the conflict in Ukraine or 
other events could result in higher fuel 
prices or reductions in scheduled airline 
services. We cannot ensure that we 
would be able to offset any increases 
in the price. In addition, lower fuel 
prices may result in lower fares through 
the reduction or elimination of fuel 
surcharges. We have entered into fuel 
hedging arrangements, but there can be 
no assurance that such arrangements 
will be adequate to protect us from an 
increase in fuel prices in the near future 
or in the long term. Also, while these 
hedging arrangements are designed to limit the effect of an increase in fuel 
prices, our hedging methods may also 
limit our ability to take advantage of any 
decrease in fuel prices, as was the case in 
2015 and, to a lesser extent, in 2016.
We rely on maintaining a high aircraft 
utilization rate to increase our revenues 
and absorb our fixed costs, which makes 
us especially vulnerable to delays.
Generally, a key element of our strategy is 
to maintain a high daily aircraft utilization 
rate, which measures the number of hours 
we use our aircraft per day. High daily 
aircraft utilization allows us to maximize 
the amount of revenue we generate from 
our aircraft and absorb the fixed costs 
associated with our fleet and is achieved, 
in part, by reducing turnaround times 
at airports and developing schedules 
that enable us to increase the average 
hours flown per day. Our rate of aircraft 
utilization could be adversely affected 
by a number of different factors that are 
beyond our control, including air traffic 
and airport congestion, adverse weather 
conditions, unanticipated maintenance 
and delays by third-party service 
providers relating to matters such as 
fueling, catering and ground handling. 
If aircrafts fall behind schedule, the 
resulting delays could cause a disruption 
in our operating performance and have a 
financial impact on our results.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the decrease in operations, the 
turnaround times between flights 
have increased to allow for the 
incorporation of numerous changes to 
the operation, such as increased aircraft 
sanitization and adjusted embarking 
and disembarking procedures. This 
increase in turnaround times has a direct 
impact on our utilization rate. As LATAM 
recovers its operations, both domestic 
and international, the turnaround times 
between flights is expected to decrease 
and the aircraft utilization is expected 
to increase. Further, as a result of our 
Chapter 11 proceedings, the majority of 
LATAM’s fleet is operating on a payment 
by use (or Power By Hour, “PBH”) 
plan, thus turning the once fixed costs 
into variable costs that are not easily 
absorbed through higher utilization.
LATAM flies and depends upon Airbus 
and Boeing aircraft, and our business 
could suffer if we do not receive timely 
deliveries of aircraft, if aircraft from these 
companies become unavailable or if the 
public negatively perceives our aircraft.
As of December 31, 2021, LATAM Airlines 
Group has a total fleet of 238 Airbus 
and 72 Boeing aircraft (six of these B767 
aircraft were classified as non-current 
assets available for sale). Risks relating 
to Airbus and Boeing include:• our failure or inability to obtain Airbus 
or Boeing aircraft, parts or related 
support services on a timely basis 
because of high demand, aircraft 
delivery backlog or other factors;
• the interruption of fleet service 
as a result of unscheduled or 
unanticipated maintenance 
requirements for these aircraft;
• the issuance by the Chilean or other 
aviation authorities of directives 
restricting or prohibiting the use 
of our Airbus or Boeing aircraft, or 
requiring time-consuming inspections 
and maintenance;
• adverse public perception of a 
manufacturer as a result of safety 
concerns, negative publicity or other 
problems, whether real or perceived, 
in the event of an accident; 
• delays between the time we realize 
the need for new aircraft and the time 
it takes us to arrange for Airbus and 
Boeing or for a third-party provider to 
deliver this aircraft; or
• the delay, for any reason, to conclude 
cabin upgrade projects that could 
result in aircraft unavailability for a 
certain period of time.Our business

RISK FACTORS
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 150The occurrence of any one or more of 
these factors could restrict our ability 
to use aircraft to generate profits, 
respond to increased demands, or could 
otherwise limit our operations and 
adversely affect our business. In the 
context of our Chapter 11 proceedings, 
certain of our agreements with suppliers 
may be rejected.
If we are unable to incorporate leased 
aircraft into the fleet at acceptable 
rates and terms in the future, our 
business could be adversely affected.
A large portion of the aircraft fleet is 
subject to long-term leases. The leases 
typically run from three to 12 years 
from the date of execution. We may 
face more competition for, or a limited 
supply of, leased aircraft, making it 
difficult to negotiate on competitive 
terms upon expiration of the current 
leases or to lease additional capacity 
required for the targeted level of 
operations. If we are forced to pay 
higher lease rates in the future to 
maintain our capacity and the number 
of aircraft in the fleet, our profitability 
could be adversely affected.
Furthermore, through LATAM’s 
emergence from Chapter 11 
proceedings, we will need Bankruptcy 
Court approval for certain lease transactions, which may delay or further 
complicate negotiations ultimately 
limiting our ability to take advantage of 
favorable market conditions.
Our business may be adversely affected 
if we are unable to service our debt or 
meet our future financing requirements.
We have a high degree of debt and 
payment obligations under our aircraft 
leases and financial debt arrangements. 
We require significant amounts of 
financing to meet our aircraft capital 
requirements and may require additional 
financing to fund our other business 
needs. We cannot guarantee that we 
will have access to or be able to arrange 
for financing in the future on favorable 
terms. Higher financing costs could 
affect our ability to expand or renew 
our fleet, which in turn could adversely 
affect our business.
In addition, a substantial portion of our 
property and equipment is subject to 
liens securing our indebtedness, including 
our debtor-in-possession financing. In 
the event that we fail to make payments 
on our debtor-in-possession financing 
or other secured indebtedness, creditors’ 
enforcement of liens could limit or end 
our ability to use the affected property 
and equipment to fulfill our operational 
needs and thus generate revenue.Moreover, external conditions in the 
financial and credit markets may limit 
the availability of funding or increase its 
costs, which could adversely affect our 
profitability, our competitive position 
and result in lower net interest margins, 
earnings and cash flows, as well as 
lower returns on shareholders’ equity 
and invested capital. Factors that may 
affect the availability of funding or 
cause an increase in our funding costs 
include global macro-economic crises, 
reductions in our credit rating or in that 
of our issuances, and other potential 
market disruptions.
We have significant exposure to 
LIBOR and other floating interest 
rates; increases in interest rates will 
increase our financing cost and may 
have adverse effects on our financial 
condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to the risk of interest 
rate variations, principally in relation to 
the U.S. dollar London Interbank Offer 
Rate (“LIBOR”). Many of our financial 
leases are denominated in U.S. dollars 
and bear interest at a floating rate. 
As of December 31, 2021, 57% of our 
outstanding consolidated debt bears 
interest at a floating rate (and 61% 
taking into account the US$662.3 
million in DIP financing provided by 
Related Parties). Volatility in LIBOR or other reference rates could increase our 
periodic interest and lease payments 
and have an adverse effect on our total 
financing costs. We may be unable to 
adequately adjust our prices to offset 
any increased financing costs, which 
would have an adverse effect on our 
results of operations.
On July 27, 2017, the head of the 
United Kingdom Financial Conduct 
Authority (“FCA”) (the authority that 
regulates LIBOR) announced that it 
intends to stop compelling banks 
to submit rates for the calculation 
of LIBOR after 2021. On March 5, 
2021 the FCA announced in a public 
statement that LIBOR for certain 
tenors would cease to be published on 
June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve 
Board and the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York convened the Alternative 
Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a 
group of private-market participants, 
to help ensure a successful transition 
from U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR to a more 
robust reference rate, its recommended 
alternative, the Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR). Although 
the adoption of SOFR is voluntary, 
the impending discontinuation of 
LIBOR makes it essential that market 
participants consider moving to 
alternative rates such as SOFR and 
that they have appropriate fallback Our business

Appendices 151language in existing contracts 
referencing LIBOR. In this regard, our 
derivative and debt contracts may be 
affected by the change in the relevant 
rate. Because the publication of LIBOR 
will cease for June 2023, we have 
begun to migrate to the adoption of 
SOFR as an alternative rate, which will 
materialize with the termination of 
LIBOR. The impact of such a transition 
away from LIBOR could be significant 
for us because of our substantial 
indebtedness.
Increases in insurance costs and/ or 
significant reductions in coverage could 
harm our financial condition and results 
of operations.
Significant events affecting the aviation 
insurance industry (such as terrorist 
attacks, airline crashes or accidents 
and health epidemics and the related 
widespread government-imposed travel 
restrictions) may result in significant 
increases of airlines’ insurance 
premiums and/or relevant decreases 
of insurance coverage. Further 
increases in insurance costs and/
or reductions in available insurance 
coverage could have a material impact 
on our financial results, change the 
insurance strategy, and also increase 
the risk of uncovered losses.Problems with air traffic control 
systems or other technical failures could 
interrupt our operations and have a 
material adverse effect on our business.
The operations, including the ability 
to deliver customer service, are 
dependent on the effective operation 
of the equipment, including aircraft, 
maintenance systems and reservation 
systems. The operations are also 
dependent on the effective operation 
of domestic and international air 
traffic control systems and the air 
traffic control infrastructure by the 
corresponding authorities in the 
markets in which the group operates. 
Equipment failures, personnel 
shortages, air traffic control problems 
and other factors that could interrupt 
operations could affect our financial 
results as well as our reputation.
We depend on a limited number of 
suppliers for certain aircraft and 
engine parts.
We depend on a limited number of 
suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines 
and many aircraft and engine parts. As 
a result, we are vulnerable to problems 
associated with the supply of those 
aircraft, parts and engines, including 
design defects, mechanical problems, 
contractual performance by the suppliers, or adverse perception by the public that 
would result in unscheduled maintenance 
requirements, in customer avoidance 
or in actions by the aviation authorities 
resulting in an inability to operate our 
aircraft. During the year 2021, LATAM 
Airline Group’s main suppliers were 
aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing.
In addition to Airbus and Boeing, LATAM 
Airlines has a number of other suppliers, 
primarily related to aircraft accessories, 
spare parts, and components, including 
Pratt & Whitney, MTU Maintenance, 
Rolls-Royce, General Electric, Pratt & 
Whitney Canada, CMF International and 
Honeywell, among others.
In the context of our Chapter 11 
proceedings, certain of our agreements 
with suppliers may be rejected.
Our business relies extensively on 
third-party service providers. Failure of 
these parties to perform as expected, or 
interruptions in our relationships with 
these providers or in their provision of 
services to us, could have an adverse 
effect on our financial position and 
results of operations.
We have engaged a significant number 
of third-party service providers to 
perform a large number of functions 
that are integral to our business, including regional operations, operation 
of customer service call centers, 
distribution and sale of airline seat 
inventory, provision of technology 
infrastructure and services, performance 
of business processes, including 
purchasing and cash management, 
provision of aircraft maintenance 
and repairs, catering, ground services, 
and provision of various utilities 
and performance of aircraft fueling 
operations, among other vital functions 
and services. We do not directly control 
these third-party service providers, 
although we do enter into agreements 
with many of them that define expected 
service performance. Any of these 
third-party service providers, however, 
may materially fail to meet their service 
performance commitments, may suffer 
disruptions to their systems that could 
impact their services, or the agreements 
with such providers may be terminated. 
For example, flight reservations 
booked by customers and/or travel 
agencies via third-party GDSs (Global 
Distribution Systems) may be adversely 
affected by disruptions in our business 
relationships with GDS operators or by 
issues in the GDS’s operations. Such 
disruptions, including a failure to agree 
upon acceptable contract terms when 
contracts expire or otherwise become 
subject to renegotiation, may cause the 
carriers’ flight information to be limited Our business

Appendices 152or unavailable for display, significantly 
increase fees for both us and GDS 
users, and impair our relationships 
with customers and travel agencies. 
The failure of any of our third-party 
service providers to adequately perform 
their service obligations, or other 
interruptions of services, may reduce 
our revenues and increase our expenses 
or prevent us from operating our flights 
and providing other services to our 
customers. In addition, our business, 
financial performance and reputation 
could be materially harmed if our 
customers believe that our services 
are unreliable or unsatisfactory. In the 
context of our Chapter 11 proceedings, 
certain of our agreements with 
suppliers and third-party contractors 
may be rejected.
Disruptions or security breaches of our 
information technology infrastructure 
or systems could interfere with the 
operations, compromise passenger or 
employee information, and expose us to 
liability, possibly causing our business 
and reputation to suffer.
A serious internal technology error, 
failure, or cybersecurity incident 
impacting systems hosted internally 
at our data centers, externally at third-
party locations or cloud providers, or 
large-scale interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as 
power, telecommunications or the 
internet, may disrupt our technology 
network with potential impact on our 
operations. Our technology systems 
and related data may also be vulnerable 
to a variety of sources of interruption, 
including natural disasters, terrorist 
attacks, telecommunications failures, 
computer viruses, cyber-attacks, 
security breaches in the supply chain 
(suppliers) and other security issues. 
These systems include our computerized 
airline reservation system, flight 
operations system, telecommunications 
systems, website, customer, self-service 
applications (“apps”), maintenance 
systems, check-in kiosks, in-flight 
entertainment systems and data centers.
In addition, as a part of our ordinary 
business operations, we collect 
and store sensitive data, including 
personal information of our customers 
and employees and information of 
our business partners. The secure 
operation of the networks and systems 
on which this type of information is 
stored, processed and maintained 
is critical to our business operations 
and strategy. Unauthorized parties 
may attempt to gain access to our 
systems or information through fraud, 
deception, or cybersecurity incidents. 
Hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could 
unexpectedly compromise information 
security. The compromise of our 
technology systems resulting in the 
loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, 
or access to, customers’ , employees’ or 
business partners’ information could 
result in legal claims or proceedings, 
liability or regulatory penalties 
under laws protecting the privacy of 
personal information, disruption to 
our operations and damage to our 
reputation, any or all of which could 
adversely affect our business.
Rapid technological advancements and 
digitalization could generate risks in 
implementation and regulatory control.
Globally, there have been large advances 
in processes of digitization and 
technological innovation, some of them 
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
These new technologies could generate 
new risks in their implementation that 
could impact us directly or indirectly. As 
an example, the implementation of 5G 
in the United States had a temporary 
impact on operations at certain airports 
and generated a review by the FAA 
on the specific requirements for its 
implementation. This risk is involved 
in all processes of digitization and 
technological innovation. Similarly, other technologies or the 
environment of rapidly increasing 
technological transformation may 
advance faster than the review and 
control capacity of the authorities or the 
knowledge or effects of their possible 
impacts, which could affect us directly 
or indirectly in ways we cannot foresee. 
Increases in our labor costs, which 
constitute a substantial portion of our 
total operating expenses, could directly 
impact our earnings.
Labor costs constitute a significant 
percentage of our total cost of sales 
(15.4% in 2021) and at times in our 
operating history we have experienced 
pressure to increase wages and benefits 
for our employees. A significant increase 
in our labor costs could result in a 
material reduction in our earnings.
Collective action by employees could 
cause operating disruptions and 
adversely impact our business.
Certain employee groups such as pilots, 
flight attendants, mechanics and our airport 
personnel have highly specialized skills. As 
a consequence, actions by these groups, 
such as strikes, walk-outs or stoppages, 
could severely disrupt operations and 
adversely impact our operating and financial 
performance, as well as our image.Our business

Appendices 153A strike, work interruption or 
stoppage or any prolonged dispute 
with employees who are represented 
by any of these unions could have 
an adverse impact on operations. 
These risks are typically exacerbated 
during periods of renegotiation 
with the unions, which typically 
occurs every two to four years 
depending on the jurisdiction and the 
union. Any renegotiated collective 
bargaining agreement could feature 
significant wage increases and a 
consequent increase in our operating 
expenses. Any failure to reach an 
agreement during negotiations with 
unions may require us to enter into 
arbitration proceedings, use financial 
and management resources, and 
potentially agree to terms that are 
less favorable to us than our existing 
agreements. Employees who are not 
currently members of unions may 
also form new unions that may seek 
further wage increases or benefits.
Our business may experience adverse 
consequences if we are unable to reach 
satisfactory collective bargaining 
agreements with unionized employees.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 
44% of the group’s employees, including 
administrative personnel, cabin crew, 
flight attendants, pilots and maintenance technicians are members of unions and 
have contracts and collective bargaining 
agreements which expire on a regular 
basis. The business, financial condition 
and results of operations could be 
materially adversely affected by a failure 
to reach agreement with any labor union 
representing such employees or by 
an agreement with a labor union that 
contains terms that are not in line  
with expectations or that prevent  
the group from competing effectively 
with other airlines.
LATAM may experience difficulty finding, 
training and retaining employees.
The business is labor intensive. The 
group employs a large number of 
pilots, flight attendants, maintenance 
technicians and other operating 
and administrative personnel. The 
airline industry has, from time to 
time, experienced a shortage of 
qualified personnel, especially pilots 
and maintenance technicians, which 
has somewhat intensified during 
the recovery phase of air traffic 
following the peak of the pandemic. 
Such shortage of qualified personnel 
is further exacerbated as a result 
of our Chapter 11 proceedings, and 
extends to non-flight personnel. In 
addition, as is common with most 
of our competitors, the group may, from time to time, face considerable 
turnover of our employees. Should 
turnover of employees, particularly 
pilots and maintenance technicians, 
sharply increase, our training costs 
will be significantly higher. LATAM 
cannot assure that it will be able to 
recruit, train and retain the managers, 
pilots, technicians and other qualified 
employees that are needed to continue 
the current operations or replace 
departing employees. An increase 
in turnover or failure to recruit, train 
and retain qualified employees at 
a reasonable cost could materially 
adversely affect the business, financial 
condition, and results of operations. As 
a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, 
the group may experience increased 
levels of employee attrition. A loss 
of key personnel or material erosion 
of employee morale could impair 
the ability to execute strategy and 
implement operational initiatives, 
thereby adversely affecting the group.
RISKS RELATING TO THE AIRLINE 
INDUSTRY AND THE COUNTRIES IN 
WHICH THE GROUP OPERATES
Our performance is heavily dependent 
on economic conditions in the countries in 
which the group does business. Negative 
economic conditions in those countries 
could adversely impact the group’s business and results of operations and 
cause the market price of our common 
shares and ADSs to decrease.
Passenger and cargo demand is heavily 
cyclical and highly dependent on global 
and local economic growth, economic 
expectations and foreign exchange 
rate variations, among other things. 
In the past, our business has been 
adversely affected by global economic 
recessionary conditions, weak economic 
growth in Chile, recessions in Brazil 
and Argentina, and poor economic 
performance in certain emerging market 
countries in which the group operates. 
The occurrence of similar events in 
the future could adversely affect our 
business. The group plans to continue 
to expand operations based in Latin 
America, which means that performance 
will continue to depend heavily on 
economic conditions in the region.
Any of the following factors could 
adversely affect the business, financial 
condition and results of operations in the 
countries in which the group operates:
• changes in economic or other 
governmental policies;
• changes in regulatory, legal or 
administrative practices;Our business
FINANCIAL RESULTS
RISK FACTORS
Integrated Report 2021
Appendices 154• weak economic performance, 
including, but not limited to, a 
slowdown in the Brazilian economy, 
political instability, low economic 
growth, low consumption and/or 
investment rates, and increased 
inflation rates; or
• other political or economic 
developments over which we have 
no control.
No assurance can be given that capacity 
reductions or other steps the group may 
take in response to weakened demand 
will be adequate to offset any future 
reduction in cargo and/or air travel 
demand in markets in which the group 
operates. Sustained weak demand may 
adversely impact our revenues, results 
of operations or financial condition.
An adverse economic environment, 
whether global, regional or in a particular 
country, could result in a reduction in 
passenger traffic, as well as a reduction 
in the cargo business, and could also 
impact the ability to set fares, which 
in turn would materially and negatively 
affect our financial condition and results 
of operations.
We are exposed to increases in landing 
fees and other airport service charges 
that could adversely affect our margin and competitive position. Also, it cannot 
be assured that in the future we will 
have access to adequate facilities and 
landing rights necessary to achieve our 
expansion plans.
The group must pay fees to airport 
operators for the use of their facilities. 
Any substantial increase in airport 
charges, including at Guarulhos 
International Airport in São Paulo, 
Jorge Chavez International Airport 
in Lima or Comodoro Arturo Merino 
Benitez International Airport in 
Santiago, could have a material 
adverse impact on our results of 
operations. Passenger taxes and 
airport charges have increased 
substantially in recent years. We 
cannot assure that the airports in 
which the group operates will not 
increase or maintain high passenger 
taxes and service charges in the 
future. Any such increases could have 
an adverse effect on our financial 
condition and results of operations.
Certain airports that we serve (or that 
we plan to serve in the future) are 
subject to capacity constraints and 
impose various restrictions, including 
takeoff and landing slot restrictions 
during certain periods of the day and 
limits on aircraft noise levels. We 
cannot be certain that the group will be able to obtain a sufficient number 
of slots, gates and other facilities at 
airports to expand services in line with 
our growth strategy. It is also possible 
that airports not currently subject to 
capacity constraints may become so 
in the future. In addition, an airline 
must use its slots on a regular and 
timely basis or risk having those slots 
re-allocated to others. Where slots or 
other airport resources are not available 
or their availability is restricted in some 
way, the group may have to amend 
schedules, change routes or reduce 
aircraft utilization. It is also possible 
that aviation authorities in the countries 
in which the group operates, change the 
rules for the assignment of takeoff and 
landing slots, as was the case with the 
São Paulo airport (Congonhas) in 2019 
where the slots previously operated 
by Avianca Brazil were reassigned. Any 
of these alternatives could have an 
adverse financial impact on operations. 
We cannot ensure that airports at which 
there are no such restrictions may not 
implement restrictions in the future 
or that, where such restrictions exist, 
they may not become more onerous. 
Such restrictions may limit our ability 
to continue to provide or to increase 
services at such airports.The business is highly regulated and 
changes in the regulatory environment 
in the different countries may 
adversely affect our business and 
results of operations.
Our business is highly regulated 
and depends substantially upon 
the regulatory environment in the 
countries in which the group operates 
or intends to operate. For example, 
price controls on fares may limit our 
ability to effectively apply customer 
segmentation profit maximization 
techniques (“passenger revenue 
management”) and adjust prices to 
reflect cost pressures. High levels 
of government regulation may limit 
the scope of our operations and our 
growth plans. The possible failure of 
aviation authorities to maintain the 
required governmental authorizations, 
or our failure to comply with applicable 
regulations, may adversely affect our 
business and results of operations.
Our business, financial condition, 
results of operations and the price 
of common shares and ADSs may be 
adversely affected by changes in policy 
or regulations at the federal, state 
or municipal level in the countries in 
which the group operates, involving or 
affecting factors such as:Our business

• tax and social security policies;
• labor regulations;
• energy and water shortages and 
rationing; and
• other political, social and economic 
developments in or affecting Brazil, 
Chile, Peru, and the United States, 
among others.
For example, the Brazilian federal 
government has frequently intervened 
in the domestic economy and made 
drastic changes in policy and regulations 
to control inflation and affect other 
policies and regulations. This has 
required the federal government to 
increase interest rates, change taxes 
and social security policies, implement 
price controls, currency exchange and 
remittance controls, devaluations, 
capital controls and limits on imports.Uncertainty over whether the Brazilian 
federal government will implement 
changes in policy or regulation affecting 
these or other factors may contribute 
to economic uncertainty in Brazil and 
to heightened volatility in the Brazilian 
securities markets and securities 
issued abroad by Brazilian companies. 
These and other developments in the 
Brazilian economy and governmental 
policies may adversely affect us and our 
business and results of operations and 
may adversely affect the trading price of 
our common shares and ADSs.
We are also subject to international 
bilateral air transport agreements that 
provide for the exchange of air traffic 
rights between the countries where the 
group operates, and we must obtain 
permission from the applicable foreign 
governments to provide service to 
foreign destinations. There can be no 
assurance that such existing bilateral 
agreements will continue, or that we will 
be able to obtain more route rights under 
those agreements to accommodate our 
future expansion plans. Certain bilateral 
agreements also include provisions that 
require substantial ownership or effective 
control. Any modification, suspension 
or revocation of one or more bilateral 
agreements could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations. The suspension of our permits to operate 
to certain airports or destinations, 
the inability for us to obtain favorable 
take-off and landing authorizations 
at certain high-density airports or the 
imposition of other sanctions could also 
have a negative impact on our business. 
We cannot be certain that a change in 
ownership or effective control or in a 
foreign government’s administration 
of current laws and regulations or the 
adoption of new laws and regulations will 
not have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition and results 
of operations.
Losses and liabilities in the event of an 
accident involving one or more of our aircraft 
could materially affect our business.
We are exposed to potential 
catastrophic losses in the event of an 
aircraft accident, terrorist incident or 
any other similar event. There can be no 
assurance that, as a result of an aircraft 
accident or significant incident:
• we will not need to increase our 
insurance coverage;
• our insurance premiums will not 
increase significantly;
• our insurance coverage will fully cover 
all of our liabilities; or• we will not be forced to bear 
substantial losses.
Substantial claims resulting from an 
accident or significant incident in excess 
of our related insurance coverage could 
have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition and results 
of operations. Moreover, any aircraft 
accident, even if fully insured, could 
cause the negative public perception 
that our operations or aircraft are less 
safe or reliable than those operated 
by other airlines, or by other flight 
operators, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations.
Insurance premiums may also increase due 
to an accident or incident affecting one of 
our alliance partners or other airlines, or 
due to a perception of increased risk in the 
industry related to concerns about war or 
terrorist attacks, the general industry, or 
general industry safety.
High levels of competition in the airline 
industry, such as the presence of low-
cost carriers in the markets in which the 
group operates, may adversely affect 
the level of operations.

results of operations could be adversely

Appendices 156within the industry, particularly the 
entrance of new competitors into the 
markets in which the group operates. 
Airlines compete primarily over fare 
levels, frequency and dependability of 
service, brand recognition, passenger 
amenities (such as frequent flyer 
programs) and the availability and 
convenience of other passenger or cargo 
services. New and existing airlines (and 
companies providing ground cargo or 
passenger transportation) could enter 
our markets and compete with us on 
any of these bases, including by offering 
lower prices, more attractive services 
or increasing their route offerings in an 
effort to gain greater market share.
Low-cost carriers have an important 
impact on the industry’s revenues given 
their low unit costs. Lower costs allow 
low-cost carriers to offer inexpensive 
fares which, in turn, allow price sensitive 
customers to fly or to shift from large to 
low cost carriers. In past years we have 
seen more interest in the development 
of the low-cost model throughout 
Latin America. For example, in the 
Chilean market, Sky Airline, our main 
competitor, has been migrating to a 
low-cost model since 2015, while in July 
2017, JetSmart, a new low-cost airline, 
started operations. In the Peruvian 
domestic market, VivaAir Peru, a new 
low-cost airline, started operations in May 2017, and in April 2019, another 
low-cost airline, Sky Airline Peru, 
started operations. In Colombia, low-
cost competitor VivaColombia has 
been operating in the domestic market 
since May 2012. A number of low-
cost carriers have announced growth 
strategies including commitments to 
acquire significant numbers of aircraft 
for delivery in the next few years. 
The entry of low-cost carriers into 
local markets in which we compete, 
including those described above, could 
have a material adverse effect on our 
operations and financial performance. 
Additionally, certain of our competitors 
have also filed voluntary petitions under 
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The 
ability of competitors to significantly 
adjust their cost structure and become 
more competitive, resulting from a 
bankruptcy reorganization process or 
other financial restructuring may also 
adversely affect our ability to compete.
International strategic growth plans 
rely, in part, upon receipt of regulatory 
approvals of the countries in which we 
plan to expand our operations with 
joint business agreements (JBA). The 
group may not be able to obtain those 
approvals, while other competitors 
might be approved. Accordingly, we 
might not be able to compete for the 
same routes as our competitors, which could diminish our market share and 
adversely impact our financial results. 
No assurances can be given as to any 
benefits, if any, that we may derive 
from such agreements.
Some of our competitors may receive 
external support, which could adversely 
impact our competitive position.
Some of our competitors may receive 
support from external sources, such 
as their national governments, which 
may be unavailable to us. Support 
may include, among others, subsidies, 
financial aid or tax waivers. This support 
could place the group at a competitive 
disadvantage and adversely affect 
operations and financial performance. 
For example, Aerolineas Argentinas has 
historically been government subsidized. 
Additionally, during the COVID-19 
pandemic, some of our competitors 
on long-haul routes have received 
government support.
Moreover, as a result of the competitive 
environment, there may be further 
consolidation in the Latin American 
and global airline industry, whether by 
means of acquisitions, joint ventures, 
partnerships or strategic alliances. 
We cannot predict the effects of 
further consolidation on the industry. 
Furthermore, consolidation in the airline industry and changes in international 
alliances will continue to affect the 
competitive landscape in the industry 
and may result in the development of 
airlines and alliances with increased 
financial resources, more extensive global 
networks and reduced cost structures.
Some of the countries where the 
group operates may not comply with 
international agreements previously 
established, which could increase the 
risk perception of doing business in that 
specific market and as a consequence 
impact the business and financial results.
Rulings by a bankruptcy court in 
Brazil and a Chapter 15 ruling by 
the Bankruptcy Court related to the 
bankruptcy proceedings of Avianca 
Brazil may appear to be inconsistent 
with the timeline set out for a debtor to 
cure a default or to return an aircraft in 
the Cape Town Convention (CTC) treaty 
that Brazil has signed, thus raising 
concerns about timings for remedies 
by creditors in respect of financings 
secured by aircraft. Accordingly, 
creditors may perceive that an increased 
business risk is created by these 
rulings for leasing or other financing 
transactions involving aircraft in Brazil 
and there is a possibility that rating 
agencies may issue lower credit ratings 
in respect of financings that are secured Our business

LATAM’s operations are subject to 
local, national and international 
environmental regulations; costs of 
compliance with applicable regulations, 
or the consequences of noncompliance, 
could adversely affect our results, our 
business or our reputation.
LATAM’s operations are affected by 
environmental regulations at local, 
national and international levels. 
These regulations cover, among other 
things, emissions to the atmosphere, 
disposal of solid waste and aqueous 
effluents, aircraft noise and other 
activities incident to the business. 
Future operations and financial results 
may vary as a result of such regulations. 
Compliance with these regulations and 
new or existing regulations that may 
be applicable to us in the future could 
increase our cost base and adversely 
affect operations and financial results. 
In addition, failure to comply with these 
regulations could adversely affect us 
in a variety of ways, including adverse 
effects on the group’s reputation.
In 2016, the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) adopted a resolution creating the 
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction 
Scheme for International Aviation 
(CORSIA), providing a framework 
for a global market-based measure 
to stabilize carbon dioxide (“CO2”) 
emissions in international civil 
aviation (i.e., civil aviation flights that 
depart in one country and arrive in 
a different country). CORSIA will be 
implemented in phases, starting with 
the participation of ICAO member 
states on a voluntary basis during a 
pilot phase (from 2021 through 2023), 
followed by a first phase (from 2024 
through 2026) and a second phase 
(from 2027). Currently, CORSIA focuses 
on defining standards for monitoring, 
reporting and verification of emissions 
from air operators, as well as on 
defining steps to offset CO2 emissions 
after 2020. To the extent most of the 
countries in which the group operates 
continue to be ICAO member states, 
in the future we may be affected by 
regulations adopted pursuant to the 
CORSIA framework.
The proliferation of national regulations 
and taxes on CO2 emissions in the 
countries that we have domestic 
operations, including environmental 
regulations that the airline industry is 
facing in Colombia, may also affect the 
cost of operations and the margins.Our business may be adversely affected 
by a downturn in the airline industry 
caused by exogenous events that affect 
travel behavior or increase costs, 
such as outbreak of disease, weather 
conditions and natural disasters, war or 
terrorist attacks.
Demand for air transportation may 
be adversely impacted by exogenous 
events, such as adverse weather 
conditions and natural disasters, 
epidemics (such as Ebola and Zika) 
and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 
pandemic), terrorist attacks, war or 
political and social instability. Increasing 
geopolitical tensions and hostilities in 
connection with the conflict in Ukraine, 
and the trade and monetary sanctions 
that have been imposed in connection 
with those developments, have affected, 
and could significantly affect, worldwide 
oil prices and demand, cause turmoil 
in the global financial system and 
negatively impact air travel. Situations 
such as these could have a material 
impact on the business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 
Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic 
and other adverse public health 
developments could have a prolonged 
effect on air transportation demand and 
any prolonged or widespread effects 
could significantly impact operations.After the terrorist attacks in the United 
States on September 11, 2001, the 
Company made the decision to reduce 
its flights to the United States. In 
connection with the reduction in service, 
the Company reduced its workforce 
resulting in additional expenses due 
to severance payments to terminated 
employees during 2001. Any future 
terrorist attacks or threat of attacks, 
whether or not involving commercial 
aircraft, any increase in hostilities 
relating to reprisals against terrorist 
organizations or otherwise and any 
related economic impact could result 
in decreased passenger traffic and 
materially and negatively affect the 
business, financial condition and results 
of operations.
After the 2001 terrorist attacks, 
airlines have experienced increased 
costs resulting from additional security 
measures that may be made even 
more rigorous in the future. In addition 
to measures imposed by the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security 
and the TSA, IATA and certain foreign 
governments have also begun to 
institute additional security measures at 
foreign airports we serve.
Revenues for airlines depend on the

Appendices 158factors, such as the timeliness of flight 
departures and arrivals. During periods 
of fog, ice, low temperatures, storms 
or other adverse weather conditions, 
some or all of our flights may be 
canceled or significantly delayed, 
reducing profitability. In addition, fuel 
prices and supplies, which constitute a 
significant cost for us, may increase as 
a result of any future terrorist attacks, 
a general increase in hostilities or a 
reduction in output of fuel, voluntary or 
otherwise, by oil-producing countries. 
Such increases may result in both higher 
airline ticket prices and decreased 
demand for air travel generally, which 
could have an adverse effect on 
revenues and results of operations.
An accumulation of ticket refunds 
could have an adverse effect on our 
financial results.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the 
corresponding widespread government-
imposed travel restrictions that are 
outside of LATAM’s control have 
resulted in an unprecedented number 
of requests for ticket refunds from 
customers due to changed or canceled 
flights. Although at the time this issue 
has been managed, we cannot assure 
you that the COVID-19 pandemic or 
other outbreak of contagious illness 
will not result in additional changed or canceled flights, and we cannot 
predict the total amount of refunds 
that customers might request as a 
result thereof. If the group is required 
to pay out a substantial amount of 
ticket refunds in cash, this could have an 
adverse effect on our financial results 
or liquidity position. Furthermore, the 
Company has agreements with financial 
institutions that process customer credit 
card transactions for the sale of air 
travel and other services. Under certain 
of the Company’s credit card processing 
agreements, the financial institutions 
in certain circumstances have the 
right to require that the Company 
maintain a reserve equal to a portion 
of advance ticket sales that have been 
processed by that financial institution, 
but for which the Company has not 
yet provided the air transportation. 
Such financial institutions may require 
cash or other collateral reserves to be 
established or withholding of payments 
related to receivables to be collected, 
including if the Company does not 
maintain certain minimum levels of 
unrestricted cash, cash equivalents 
and short-term investments. Refunds 
lower our liquidity and put us at risk of 
triggering liquidity covenants in these 
processing agreements and, in doing so, 
could force us to post cash collateral 
with the credit card companies for 
advance ticket sales.LATAM is subject to risks relating 
to litigation and administrative 
proceedings that could adversely affect 
the business and financial performance 
in the event of an unfavorable ruling.
The nature of the business exposes us 
to litigation relating to labor, insurance 
and safety matters, regulatory, tax 
and administrative proceedings, 
governmental investigations, tort claims 
and contract disputes. Litigation is 
inherently costly and unpredictable, 
making it difficult to accurately estimate 
the outcome among other matters. 
Currently, as in the past, we are subject 
to proceedings or investigations of 
actual or potential litigation. Although 
we establish accounting provisions as 
we deem necessary, the amounts that 
we reserve could vary significantly 
from any amounts we actually have to 
pay due to the inherent uncertainties 
in the estimation process. We cannot 
assure you that these or other legal 
proceedings will not materially affect 
the business.
The group is subject to anti-corruption, 
anti-bribery, anti-money laundering 
and antitrust laws and regulations in 
Chile, Brazil, Peru, the United States 
and in the various other countries in 
which it operates. Violations of any 
such laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our 
reputation and results of operations and

We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-
bribery, anti-money laundering, antitrust 
and other international laws and 
regulations and are required to comply 
with the applicable laws and regulations 
of all jurisdictions where the group 
operates. In addition, we are subject 
to economic sanctions regulations that 
restrict dealings with certain sanctioned 
countries, individuals and entities. 
There can be no assurance that internal 
policies and procedures will be sufficient 
to prevent or detect all inappropriate 
practices, fraud or violations of law by 
affiliates, employees, directors, officers, 
partners, agents and service providers 
or that any such persons will not take 
actions in violation of our policies

occasionally make significant changes 
in policy and regulations. Governmental 
actions have often involved, among 
other measures, nationalizations and 
expropriations, price controls, currency 
devaluations, mandatory increases on 
wages and employee benefits, capital 
controls and limits on imports. Our 
business, financial condition and results 
of operations may be adversely affected 
by changes in government policies or 
regulations, including such factors as 
exchange rates and exchange control 
policies, inflation control policies, price 
control policies, consumer protection 
policies, import duties and restrictions, 
liquidity of domestic capital and 
lending markets, electricity rationing, 
tax policies, including tax increases 
and retroactive tax claims, and 
other political, diplomatic, social and 
economic developments in or affecting 
the countries where the group operates.
For example, the Brazilian government’s 
actions to control inflation and 
implement other policies have involved 
wage and price controls, depreciation 
of the real, controls over remittance 
of funds abroad, intervention by the 
Central Bank to affect base interest 
rates and other measures. In the 
future, the level of intervention by 
Latin American governments may continue or increase. We cannot assure 
that these or other measures will not 
have a material adverse effect on the 
economy of each respective country 
and, consequently, will not adversely 
affect our business, financial condition 
and results of operations.
Political instability and social unrest 
in Latin America may adversely affect 
the business.
LATAM operates primarily within Latin 
America and is thus subject to a full 
range of risks associated with our 
operations in this region. These risks 
may include unstable political or social 
conditions, lack of well-established 
or reliable legal systems, exchange 
controls and other limits on our ability 
to repatriate earnings and changeable 
legal and regulatory requirements.
Although political and social conditions 
in one country may differ significantly 
from another country, events in any of 
our key markets could adversely affect 
the business, financial conditions or 
results of operations.
For example, in Brazil, in the last couple 
of years, as a result of the ongoing 
Lava Jato investigation (“Operation Car 
Wash”), a number of senior politicians 
have resigned or been arrested and other senior elected officials and 
public officials are being investigated 
for allegations of corruption. One 
of the most significant events that 
elapsed from this operation was the 
impeachment of the former President 
Rousseff by the Brazilian Senate on 
August, 2016, for violations of fiscal 
responsibility laws and the governing 
of its Vice-President, Michel Temer, 
during the last two years of the 
presidential mandate, which, due to 
the development of the investigations 
conducted by the Federal Police 
Department and the General Federal 
Prosecutor’s Office, indicted President 
Temer on corruption charges. Along with 
the political and economic uncertainty 
period the country was facing, in July 
2017, former President Luiz Inácio Lula 
da Silva was convicted of corruption 
and money laundering by a lower 
federal court in the State of Paraná in 
connection with Operation Car Wash.
In Peru, on September 30, 2019, 
President Martin Vizcarra took the 
executive action to dissolve the Peruvian 
Congress and called for a new election 
of congressional members. In response 
to the dissolution of the Congress, 
former members of the legislative body 
voted to suspend President Vizcarra 
for twelve months and appointed 
Vice President Mercedes Araoz as interim president to temporarily 
replace Mr. Vizcarra. Vice President 
Araoz resigned from her position as 
interim president the following day. 
On January 14, 2020, the Peruvian 
Constitutional Court declared the 
executive action taken by President 
Vizcarra to be constitutionally and 
legally valid.
On October 20, 2020, a group of 27 
congressmen introduced a motion to 
hold new impeachment proceedings 
against President Vizcarra as a 
result of allegations that President 
Vizcarra received illicit payments from 
construction companies when he was 
the governor of Moquegua (between 
2011 and 2014). On November 2, 2020, 
the Peruvian Congress voted to hold 
new impeachment proceedings. On 
November 9, 2020, with the affirmative 
vote of the required qualified members 
of Congress, the impeachment of 
President Vizcarra was approved. 
Because, at the time, Peru did not have 
designated vice presidents, the then-
president of the Congress, Manuel 
Arturo Merino de Lama, assumed 
the role of acting President. Since 
that day, Peru had been undergoing 
political and social unrest, followed by 
multiple protests within the country. 
On November 15, 2020, Manuel Arturo 
Merino de Lama resigned from his Our business

and he assumed the role of acting 
President on November 17, 2020 until 
July 28, 2021.
On June 6, 2021, the second electoral 
round between Keiko Fujimori and Pedro 
Castillo was held. The winner of the 
election by a tight margin was Pedro 
Castillo, however, accusations of electoral 
fraud have arisen since then, generating 
instability in the country and raising the 
US dollar exchange rate to historical 
levels. Currently, the instability in the 
country continues due to the policies 
implemented by the current president 
and the current Congress of the Republic, 
a period that has also been marked by 
a high level of uncertainty following 
recurrent changes in the members of the 
government’s cabinet.
In October 2019, Chile saw significant 
protests associated with economic 
conditions resulting in the declaration of 
a state of emergency in several major 
cities. The protests in Chile began over 
criticisms about social inequality, lack 
of quality education, weak pensions, 
increasing prices and low minimum 
wage. If social unrest in Chile were to 
continue or intensify, it could lead to operational delays or adversely impact 
our ability to operate in Chile.
Furthermore, current initiatives to 
address the concerns of the protesters 
are under discussion in the Chilean 
Congress. These initiatives include 
labor reforms, tax reforms and pension 
reforms, among others. It is not possible 
to predict the effect of these changes 
as they are still under discussion, but 
they could potentially result in higher 
payments of wages and salaries and 
an increase in taxes. On October 25, 
2020 (postponed from April 26, 2020 
due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic), Chile widely approved a 
referendum to redraft the constitution 
via constitutional convention. The 
election for selecting the 155-member 
constitutional convention took place 
on May 15 and 16, 2021. On July 4, 
2021, the constitutional convention 
was installed, having 9 months, with 
the possibility of a one-time, three-
month extension, to present a new 
constitution, which will be approved or 
rejected in a referendum during 2022. 
In addition, Chile held presidential 
elections in December 2021, with leftist 
Gabriel Boric winning by a wide margin.
Although conditions throughout 
Latin America vary from country to 
country, our customers’ reactions to developments in Latin America generally 
may result in a reduction in passenger 
traffic, which could materially and 
negatively affect our financial condition 
and results of operations.
Latin American countries have 
experienced periods of adverse 
macroeconomic conditions.
The business is dependent upon 
economic conditions prevalent in Latin 
America. Latin American countries 
have historically experienced economic 
instability, including uneven periods of 
economic growth as well as significant 
downturns. High interest, inflation (in 
some cases substantial and prolonged), 
and unemployment rates generally 
characterize each economy. Because 
commodities such as agricultural 
products, minerals, and metals represent 
a significant percentage of exports 
of many Latin American countries, 
the economies of those countries are 
particularly sensitive to fluctuations in 
commodity prices. Investments in the 
region may also be subject to currency 
risks, such as restrictions on the flow 
of money in and out of the country, 
extreme volatility relative to the U.S. 
dollar, and devaluation.
For example, in the past, Peru has 
experienced periods of severe economic recession, currency devaluation, high 
inflation, and political instability, 
which have led to adverse economic 
consequences. LATAM cannot ensure that 
Peru will not experience similar adverse 
developments in the future even though 
for some years now, several democratic 
procedures have been completed without 
any violence. LATAM cannot ensure that 
the current or any future administration 
will maintain business-friendly and open 
market economic policies or policies that 
stimulate economic growth and social 
stability. In Brazil, the Brazil Real gross 
domestic product decreased 3.5% in 
2015, decreased 3.3% in 2016, increased 
1.3% in 2017, increased 1.8% in 2018 
and 1.1% in 2019, and decreased 4.1% in 
2020, according to the Brazilian Institute 
for Geography and Statistics (Instituto 
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estadística, or 
“IGBE”). In addition, the credit rating of 
the Brazilian federal government was 
downgraded in 2015 and 2016 by all 
major credit rating agencies and is no 
longer investment grade. LATAM can offer 
no assurances as to the policies that may 
be implemented by the recently elected 
Argentine administration, or that political 
developments in Argentina will not 
adversely affect the Argentine economy. 
Accordingly, any changes in the 
economies of the Latin American 
countries in which LATAM and its Our business

RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON 
SHARES AND ADSS
Because our post-bankruptcy capital 
structure is yet to be determined, and 
any changes to our capital structure 
may have a material adverse effect 
on holders of the ADSs or our shares, 
trading in the ADSs or our shares 
during the pendency of our Chapter 11 
proceedings is highly speculative and 
poses substantial risks.
Our post-bankruptcy capital structure will 
be set pursuant to a reorganization plan 
that requires approval by the bankruptcy 
court. The reorganization of our capital 
structure may include exchanges of 
new equity securities for existing equity 
securities or of debt securities for equity 
securities, which would dilute any value 
of our existing equity securities, or may 
provide for all existing equity interests 
in us to be extinguished. In this case, 
amounts invested by holders of the ADSs 
or our shares will not be recoverable and 
these securities will have no value.
As a result of our Chapter 11 
proceedings, on June 10, 2020, the NYSE notified the SEC of its intention 
to remove the ADSs from listing and 
registration on the NYSE, effective at the 
opening of business on June 22, 2020. 
As of the date of this annual report, 
the ADSs are traded in the over-the-
counter market, which is a less liquid 
market. There can be no assurance that 
the ADSs will continue to trade in the 
over-the-counter market or that any 
public market for the ADSs will exist in 
the future, whether broker-dealers will 
continue to provide public quotes of the 
ADSs, whether the trading volume of the 
ADSs will be sufficient to provide for an 
efficient trading market, whether quotes 
for the ADSs may be blocked in the 
future or that we will be able to relist the 
ADSs on a securities exchange.
Trading prices of the ADSs or our 
shares bear no relationship to the 
actual recovery, if any, by their 
holders in the context of our Chapter 
11 proceedings. Additionally, trading 
prices of ADSs or our shares may 
experience significant fluctuation 
and volatility. Due to these and other 
risks described in this annual report, 
trading in the ADSs or our shares 
during the pendency of our Chapter 11 
proceedings poses substantial risks and 
we urge extreme caution with respect 
to existing and future investments in 
these securities.Our major shareholders may have 
interests that differ from those of our 
other shareholders. 
One of the major shareholder groups, 
the Cueto Group (the “Cueto Group”), 
beneficially owned 16.39% of our common 
shares as of February 28, 2022.  In 
addition, other shareholders including, Delta 
Air Lines, Inc, which, as of February 28, 
2022, held 20.00% of our common shares, 
and Qatar Airways Investments (UK) 
Ltd., which as of February 28, 2022, held 
9.999999918% of our common shares, 
could have interests that may differ from 
those of our other shareholders. Moreover, 
our shareholder structure may change after 
emergence from Chapter 11 proceedings, 
and future major shareholders could have 
interests that may differ from those of our 
other shareholders. 
Under the terms of the deposit 
agreement governing the ADSs, 
if holders of ADSs do not provide 
JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its 
capacity as depositary for the ADSs, 
with timely instructions on the voting 
of the common shares underlying their 
ADRs, the depositary will be deemed to 
have been instructed to give a person 
designated by the board of directors 
the discretionary right to vote those 
common shares. The person designated 
by the board of directors to exercise this discretionary voting right may 
have interests that are aligned with our 
majority shareholders, which may differ 
from those of our other shareholders. 
Historically, our board of directors has 
designated its chairman to exercise 
this right; for example, the members of 
the board of directors elected by the 
shareholders in 2021 designated Mr. 
Ignacio Cueto, to serve in this role.
Trading of our ADSs and common shares 
in the securities markets is limited and 
could experience further illiquidity and 
price volatility.
Our common shares are listed on the 
two Chilean stock exchanges. Chilean 
securities markets are substantially 
smaller, less liquid and more volatile than 
major securities markets in the United 
States. In addition, Chilean securities 
markets may be materially affected by 
developments in other emerging markets, 
particularly other countries in Latin 
America. Accordingly, although you are 
entitled to withdraw the common shares 
underlying the ADSs from the depositary 
at any time, your ability to sell the 
common shares underlying ADSs in the 
amount and at the price and time of your 
choice may be substantially limited. This 
limited trading market may also increase 
the price volatility of the ADSs or the 
common shares underlying the ADSs.Our business

Appendices 162Holders of ADRs may be adversely 
affected by currency devaluations and 
foreign exchange fluctuations.
If the Chilean peso exchange rate falls 
relative to the U.S. dollar, the value of the 
ADSs and any distributions made thereon 
from the depositary could be adversely 
affected. Cash distributions made in 
respect of the ADSs are received by the 
depositary (represented by the custodian 
bank in Chile) in pesos, converted by 
the custodian bank into U.S. dollars at 
the then-prevailing exchange rate and 
distributed by the depositary to the 
holders of the ADRs evidencing those 
ADSs. In addition, the depositary will 
incur foreign currency conversion costs 
(to be borne by the holders of the ADRs) 
in connection with the foreign currency 
conversion and subsequent distribution 
of dividends or other payments with 
respect to the ADSs.
Future changes in Chilean foreign 
investment controls and withholding 
taxes could negatively affect non-Chilean 
residents that invest in our shares.
Equity investments in Chile by non-
Chilean residents have been subject in 
the past to various exchange control 
regulations that govern investment 
repatriation and earnings thereon. 
Although not currently in effect, regulations of the Central Bank of Chile 
have in the past imposed such exchange 
controls. Nevertheless, foreign investors 
still have to provide the Central Bank with 
information related to equity investments 
and must conduct such operations within 
the formal exchange market. Furthermore, 
any changes in withholding taxes could 
negatively affect non-Chilean residents 
that invest in our shares.
We cannot assure you that additional 
Chilean restrictions applicable to the 
holders of ADRs, the disposition of 
the common shares underlying ADSs 
or the repatriation of the proceeds 
from an acquisition, a disposition or a 
dividend payment, will not be imposed 
or required in the future, nor could we 
make an assessment as to the duration 
or impact, were any such restrictions to 
be imposed or required.
Our ADS holders may not be able to 
exercise preemptive rights in certain 
circumstances.
To the extent that a holder of our ADSs 
is unable to exercise its preemptive 
rights because a registration statement 
has not been filed, the depositary may 
attempt to sell the holder’s preemptive 
rights and distribute the net proceeds 
of the sale, net of the depositary’s fees 
and expenses, to the holder, provided that a secondary market for those 
rights exists and a premium can be 
recognized over the cost of the sale. 
A secondary market for the sale of 
preemptive rights can be expected to 
develop if the subscription price of 
the shares of our common stock upon 
exercise of the rights is below the 
prevailing market price of the shares 
of our common stock. However, we 
cannot assure you that a secondary 
market in preemptive rights will develop 
in connection with any future issuance 
of shares of our common stock or that 
if a market develops, a premium can 
be recognized on their sale. Amounts 
received in exchange for the sale or 
assignment of preemptive rights relating 
to shares of our common stock will 
be taxable in Chile and in the United 
States. The inability of holders of 
ADSs to exercise preemptive rights in 
respect of common shares underlying 
their ADSs could result in a change in 
their percentage ownership of common 
shares following a preemptive rights 
offering. If a secondary market for the 
sale of preemptive rights does not 
develop and such rights cannot be sold, 
they will expire and a holder of our 
ADSs will not realize any value from 
the grant of the preemptive rights. In 
either case, the equity interest of a 
holder of our ADSs in us will be diluted 
proportionately.We are not required to disclose as 
much information to investors as a U.S. 
issuer is required to disclose and, as a 
result, you may receive less information 
about us than you would receive from a 
comparable U.S. company.
The corporate disclosure requirements 
that apply to us may not be equivalent 
to the disclosure requirements that 
apply to a U.S. company and, as a 
result, you may receive less information 
about us than you would receive from 
a comparable U.S. company. We are 
subject to the reporting requirements 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The 
disclosure requirements applicable to 
foreign issuers under the Exchange Act 
are more limited than the disclosure 
requirements applicable to U.S. issuers. 
Publicly available information about 
issuers of securities listed on Chilean 
stock exchanges also provides less 
detail in certain respects than the 
information regularly published by listed 
companies in the United States or in 
certain other countries. Furthermore, 
there is a lower level of regulation 
of the Chilean securities market and 
of the activities of investors in such 
markets as compared with the level of 
regulation of the securities markets in 
the United States and in certain other 
developed countries.Our business

 Opinion   
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects the financial position of Latam Airlines Group S.A. and subsidiaries as at December 31, 20 21 and 20 20, 
and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  
 Emphasis of matter – Going Concern  
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will cont inue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, 
Latam Airlines Group S.A. and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and as a result, the satisfaction of the Company’s liabilities and funding of ongoing operation are subject to uncertainty. The Company has 
stated that these events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast 
significant doubt on the Com pany’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in 
regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The 
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome o f this 
uncertainty.  Our opinion is not modified as a result of this matter.  
   
 
 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  
(Free translation from the original in Spanish)  
 
Santiago, March 8 , 202 2 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders  
Latam Airlines Group S.A.  
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Latam Airlines Group S.A. and subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 
31, 20 21 and 2020  and the consolidated statements of income by  function, consolidated 
comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows –  direct method 
for the years then ended, and the corresponding notes to the consolidated financial statements.  
 
Management’s responsibility for the co nsolidated financial statements  
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of a relevant internal control for 
the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
 
Auditor’s responsibility  
 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with Chilean Generally Accepted Auditing Standards. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.  
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers 
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose o f expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. As a 
consequence we do not express that kind of opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting e stimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  
 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion.

Financial Instruments, illustrative examples accompanying 
IFRS 16: Leases, IAS 41: Agriculture  May 2020  01/01/2022  
 
The Company's management estimates that the adoption of the standards, amendments and 
interpretations described above will not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated 
financial statements in the exercise of their first application.  
 (c)  Chapter 11 Filing and Going Concern  
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements hav e been prepared on a going concern basis, 
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of 
business.  As disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company 
incurred a net los s attributable to owners of the parent of US$ 4,642 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2021. As of that date, the Company has a negative working capital of US$ 9,701 million and will require additional working capital during 2021 to support a sustaina ble business 
operation. As of December 31, 2021, the company has negative equity of US$ 7,051 million, which 
corresponds to the attributable equity to the owners of the parent.  
 LATAM Group passenger traffic for the year ended December 31, 2021, increasing  by 18% 
compared to the same period in 2020 (decreasing by 59,6% compared to the same exercise in 2019).  
 In December 2021, the group’s revenues amounted to approximately 49% of revenues for the year 
ended December 31, 2019. At this time, the pace to meet the pre -COVID demand are uncertain and 
highly dependent on the evolution of the COVID -19 pandemic in the markets in which LATAM 
Group operates, therefore, management cannot make specific predictions as to this timing, but 
considers it reasonable to expect that the pace of the demand recovery will be different for each 
country.   
 On May 26, 2020 (the “Initial Petition Date”), LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and certain of its direct 
and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Initial Debtors”) filed voluntary p etitions for 
reorganization (the “Initial Bankruptcy Filing”) under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of 
New York. On July 7, 2020 (the “Piquero Petition  Date”), Piquero Leasing Limited (“Piquero”) 
also filed a petition for reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court (the “Piquero Bankruptc  y 
Filing”).  On July 9, 2020 (together with the Initial Petition Date and Piquero Petition Date, as 
applicable, the “Pet ition Date”), TAM S.A. and certain of its subsidiaries in Brazil (collectively, the 
“Subsequent Debtors” and, together with the Initial Debtors and Piquero, the “Debtors”) also filed 
petitions for reorganization (together with the Initial Bankruptcy Filing  and the Piquero Bankruptcy 
Filing, the “Bankruptcy Filing”), as a consequence of the prolonged effects of the COVID -19 
Pandemic.  The Bankruptcy Filing for each of the Debtors (each one, respectively, a “Petition Date”) is being jointly administered under  the caption “In re LATAM Airlines Group S.A. et al.” 
Case Number 20 -11254.  The Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as “debtors -in-
possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of  the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. On June  28, 2021, 
LATAM Airlines Perú withdrew  its request for a preventive bankruptcy process previously filed 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 1788 
 
 before the Indecopi of Peru, entity which approved said withdrawal by resolution with out further 
comments.  
 
The Bankruptcy Filing is intended to permit the Company to reorganize and improve liquidity, wind down unprofitable contracts and amend its capacity purchase agreements to enable sustainable 
profitability.  The Company’s goal is to d evelop and implement a plan of reorganization that meets 
the standards for confirmation under the Bankruptcy Code.  
 
As part of their overall reorganization process, the Debtors also have sought and received relief in certain non -U.S. jurisdictions.  On May  27, 2020, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands granted 
the applications of certain of the Debtors for the appointment of provisional liquidators (“JPLs”) pursuant to section 104(3) of the Companies Law (2020 Revision).  On June 4, 2020, the 2nd Civil 
Court of Santiago, Chile issued an order recognizing the Chapter 11 proceeding with respect to the 
LATAM Airlines Group S.A., Lan Cargo S.A., Fast Air Almacenes de Carga S.A., Latam Travel 
Chile II S.A., Lan Cargo Inversiones S.A., Transporte Aéreo S.A., Inve rsiones Lan S.A., Lan Pax 
Group S.A. and Technical Training LATAM S.A.  All remedies filed against the order have been rejected and the decision is, then, final.  Finally, on June 12, 2020, the Superintendence of 
Companies of Colombia granted recognition t o the Chapter 11 proceedings.  On July 10, 2020, the 
Grand Court of the Cayman Islands granted the Debtors’ application for the appointment of JPLs to 
Piquero Leasing Limited.  
 Operation and Implication of the Bankruptcy Filing 
 The Debtors continue to ope rate their businesses and manage their properties as debtors -in-
possession pursuant to sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code.  As debtors -in-
possession, the Debtors are authorized to engage in transactions within the ordinary course of 
business without prior authorization of the Bankruptcy Court.  The protections afforded by the 
Bankruptcy Code allows the Debtors to operate their business without interruption, and the 
Bankruptcy Court has granted additional relief including, inter alia, the autho rity, but not the 
obligation, to (i) pay amounts owed under certain critical airline agreements; (ii) pay certain third -
parties who hold liens or other possessory interests in the Debtors’ property; (iii) pay employee wages and continue employee benefit pr ograms; (iv) pay prepetition taxes and related fees; (v) 
continue insurance and surety bond programs; (vi) pay certain de minimis litigation judgements or settlements without prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court; (vii) pay fuel supplies; and (viii) pay 
certain foreign vendors and certain vendors deemed critical to the Debtors’ operations.  
 
As debtors -in-possession, the Debtors may use, sell, or lease property of their estates, subject to the 
Bankruptcy Court’s approval if not otherwise in the ordinary cou rse of business.  On November 26, 
2021, the Debtors filed a joint plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) and the related disclosure 
statement (the “Disclosure Statement”) with the Bankruptcy Court.  As detailed in the Disclosure 
Statement, the Plan is support ed by a restructuring support agreement executed among the Debtors, 
creditors holding more than 70% of the general unsecured claims asserted against LATAM Airline 
Group S.A., and holders of more than 50% of LATAM Airline Group S.A.’s existing equity.  As o f 
December 31, 2021, the Plan remains subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court and could materially change the amounts and classifications in the consolidated financial statements, including 
the value, if any, of the Debtors’ prepetition liabilities and  securities.  On December 17, 2021, 
December 20, 2021, January 24, 2022, January 27, 2022, and February 28, 2022, the Debtors filed a revised Plan and associated Disclosure Statement.  
 9 
 
 On November 1, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order extending th e periods in which the 
Debtors have the exclusive right to file and solicit a plan of reorganization to November 26, 2021 
and January 26, 2022 respectively.  On November 26, 2021, the Debtors filed a motion to further 
extend such periods, solely with respe ct to the Subsequent Debtors, to January 7, 2022 and March 7, 
2022 respectively.  On December 15, 2021, the Creditors’ Committee filed an objection to the 
Subsequent Debtors’ motion.  That same day, the Creditors’ Committee also filed a motion seeking to terminate the Debtors’ exclusivity periods.  Certain other interested parties subsequently filed 
joinders to the Creditors’ Committee’s termination motion, while others filed statements opposing the termination motion.  On February 14, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving 
the Subsequent Debtors’ motion and denying the Creditors’ Committee’s motion.  
 Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Cases  
 Since the first quarter of 2020, the passenger air transportation business was affected worldwide by a significant decrease in international air traffic, due to the closure of international borders with the 
aim of protecting the population from the effects of COVID -19, an infectious disease caused by a 
new virus, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organ ization.  
 LATAM’s preliminary assessment in the beginning of March 2020 indicated previous disease outbreaks have peaked after few months and recovered pre -outbreak levels in no more than 6 to 7 
months, and the effect with scenery impacting mainly on Asia  Pacific Airlines, indicating impact on 
Latin America of a marginal decrease of Revenue Per Kilometers forecast.  
 For the Company, the reduction in its operation began in the middle of March 2020 with the 
announcement of a 30% decrease in its operations an d the suspension of the guidance for 2020 in 
line with protection measures and boarding restrictions implemented by local governments (March 
16, 2020 for Peru, Colombia and Argentina, March 18, 2020 for Chile and March 27, 2020 for 
Brazil). On March 16, 20 20, the Company announced an update of its projection to a progressive 
decrease in its operation up to 70%.  
By March 29, 2020, COVID 19 had already generated an unprecedented shock on Airlines Industry, specifically on airlines passenger revenue. The situ ation has both broadened and deepened beyond 
the initial assessment.   
 
In response to COVID 19, governments have been imposing much more severe border restrictions 
and airlines have been subsequently announcing sharp capacity cuts in response to a dramati c drop 
in travel demand. On April 2, 2020, the Company announced a decrease in its operation by 95%.  
 In order to protect liquidity, the Company has carried out financial transactions, such as the use of 
funds from the Revolving Credit Facility (Revolving Credit Facility) for US $ 600 million, which 
have affected its financial assets and liabilities, especially the items of Cash and cash equivalents 
and other financial liabilitie.  
 Among the initiatives that the Company studied and committed to protect liqu idity were the 
following:  
 
(i) Reduction and postponement of the investment plan for different projects;  
(ii) Implementation of control measurements for payments to suppliers and purchases of new 
goods and services;  
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 17910 
 
 (iii) Negotiation of the payment conditi ons with suppliers; 
(iv) Ticket refunds via travel vouchers and Frequent Flyer Program points and miles; all in all, 
the LATAM Group will continue to honor all current and future tickets, as well as travel vouchers, 
frequent flyer miles and benefits, and f lexibility policies;  
(v) Temporary reduction of salaries, considering the legal framework of each country: as of the 
second quarter, the Company implemented a voluntary process to reduce salaries in force until December 31, 2020. Associated with the restru cturing plan and in order to adapt to the new demand 
scenario, the company has designed a staff reduction plan in the different countries where it operates. The costs associated with the execution of this plan were recorded in income as Restructuring activ ities expenses. (See note 27d);  
(vi) Short -term debt and debt maturities renewal;  
(vii) Governmental loan request in different countries in which the company operates; and  
Reduction of non -essential fleet and non -fleet investments.  
 The Company, in consult ation with its advisors, also evaluated a variety of potential restructuring 
options.  In the opinion of the Board, the timings for a conventional bilateral process, the possibility that creditors may have decided to engage in collection actions, the impos sibility of curing defaults 
and the need to implement a comprehensive restructuring of LATAM Airlines to which all its creditors and other interested parties must join, lead the Board to consider an in -court bankruptcy 
proceedings the best alternative.  In  addition, the Board noted that other benefits of an in -court 
bankruptcy proceeding, including the imposition of the Bankruptcy Code’s “automatic stay,” which protects the Company from efforts by creditors and other interested parties to take action in res pect 
of pre -bankruptcy debt, but which, at the same time, allows it to continue operating with its main 
assets, suppliers, financial parties, regulators and employees, while structuring a binding 
reorganization to be financially viable in a post -pandemic s cenario.  
 
Due to the foregoing, and after consulting the administration and the legal and financial advisors of 
the Company, on May 26, 2020 the Board resolved unanimously that LATAM Airlines should 
initiate a reorganization process in the United States of  America according to the rules established 
in the Bankruptcy Code by filing a voluntary petition for relief in accordance with the same.  
 Since the Chapter 11 filing, the Company secured up to US$ 3.2 billion in a debtor -in-possession 
financing facility ( the “DIP Facility”), as provided for in in the Super -Priority Debtor -in-Possession 
Term Loan Agreement (the “DIP Credit Agreement”)  (See Note 3.1 c)).  
 Plan of Reorganization  
 
In order for the Company to emerge successfully from Chapter 11, the Company mus t obtain the 
Bankruptcy Court’s approval of a plan of reorganization, which will enable the Company to 
transition from Chapter 11 into ordinary course operations outside of bankruptcy.  A plan of 
reorganization determines the rights and satisfaction of cla ims of various creditors and parties -in-
interest, and is subject to the ultimate outcome of negotiations and Bankruptcy Court decisions 
ongoing through the date on which the plan of reorganization is confirmed. Any proposed plan of 
reorganization will be s ubject to revision based upon discussions with the Company’s creditors and 
other interested parties, and thereafter in response to interested parties’ objections and the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Court.  There is no guarantee at th is time that 
the Company will be able to obtain approval of the Plan from the Bankruptcy Court.  
 11 
 
 On November 26, 2021, the Company filed the Plan and associated Disclosure Statement.  The Plan is accompanied by a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”)  with the largest unsecured 
creditor group in the Chapter 11 Cases —holding of more than 70% of unsecured claims filed 
against LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and holders of approximately 48% of the US -law governed 
notes issued by LATAM Finance Ltd. due 2024 and 2026— as well as certain of the Company’s 
shareholders holding more than 50% of LATAM Airlines Group S.A.’s existing equity.   
 
The Plan proposes the infusion of up to approximately $8.19 billion through a mix of new equity, 
convertible notes, and debt, whi ch will enable the Company to exit Chapter 11 with appropriate 
capitalization to effectuate its business plan.  Upon emergence, the Company is expected to have 
total debt of approximately $7.26 billion and liquidity of approximately $2.67 billion.  Specifi cally, 
the Plan outlines that:  
 Upon confirmation of the Plan, the Company intends to launch an $800 million common 
equity rights offering, open to all shareholders in accordance with their preemptive rights under applicable Chilean law, and fully backstopp ed by the parties participating in the 
RSA;  
 Three distinct classes of convertible notes will be issued by the Company, all of which will 
be preemptively offered to shareholders. To the extent not subscribed by the Company’s 
shareholders during the respecti ve preemptive rights period:  
o Convertible Notes Class A will be provided to certain general unsecured creditors 
of the Company in settlement of their allowed claims under the Plan;  
o Convertible Notes Class B will be subscribed and purchased by the sharehold ers 
parties to the RSA; and  
o Convertible Notes Class C will be provided to certain general unsecured creditors 
in exchange for a combination of new money to the Company and the settlement of their claims, subject to certain limitations and holdbacks by bac kstopping parties.  
 The convertible notes belonging to the New Convertible Notes Classes B and C will be 
provided, totally or partially, in consideration of a new money contribution for the 
aggregate amount of approximately $4.64 billion fully backstopped by the parties to the 
RSA; and  
 LATAM will raise a $500 million new revolving credit facility and approximately $2.25 
billion in total new money debt financing, consisting of either a new term loan or new 
notes. The general deadline to file objections to th e Plan and Disclosure Statement was 
January 7, 2022, and such deadline was further extended to January 12, 2022 and January 
14, 2022 for certain interested parties.

 Going Concern  
 
These Consolidated Financial Statements have also been prepared on a going concern basis, which 
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the 
ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any 
adjustments relating to the recovera bility of assets and classification of liabilities that might be 
necessary should the Debtors be unable to continue as a going concern.  
 
As a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the satisfaction of the Company’s liabilities and funding of ongoing operati ons are subject to material uncertainty as a product of the COVID -19 pandemic 
and the impossibility of knowing its duration at this date and, accordingly, a material uncertainty 
exists that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as  a going concern. 
There is no assurance that the Company will be able to emerge successfully from Chapter 11.  
Additionally, there is no assurance that long -term funding would be available at rates and on terms 
and conditions that would be financially acce ptable and viable to the Company in the long term.  If 
the Company is unable to generate additional working capital or raise additional financing when 
needed, it may not able to reinitiate currently suspended operations as a result of the COVID -19 
pandemic , which could adversely affect the value of the Company’s common stock, or render it 
worthless. Additionally, in connection with the Chapter 11 Filing, material modifications could be 
made to the Company’s fleet and capacity purchase agreements.  These mod ifications could 
materially affect the Company’s financial results going forward, and could result in future 
impairment charges.  
 
Chapter 11 Milestones  
 Notice to Creditors - Effect of the Automatic Stay  
 The Debtors have notified all known current or pote ntial creditors that the Chapter 11 Cases were 
filed.  Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code and subject to certain limited exceptions, the filing of the 
Chapter 11 Cases gave rise to an automatic, worldwide injunction that precludes, among other 
things, any act  to (i) obtain possession of property of or from the Debtors’ estates, (ii) create, 
perfect, or enforce any lien against property of the Debtors’ estates; (iii) exercise control over property of the Debtors’ estate, wherever in the world that property may be located; and further 
enjoined or stayed (iv) and also ordered or suspended the commencement or continuation of any 
judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that could have been 
commenced before the Petition Date or effo rts to recover a claim against the Debtors that arose 
before the Petition Date.  Vendors are being paid for goods furnished and services provided postpetition in the ordinary course of business.  
 
On August 31, 2020 (the “First Stay Motion”), and December 3 0, 2020 (the “Second Stay 
Motion”), Corporación Nacional de Consumidores y Usuarios de Chile (“CONADECUS”) filed 
two motions in the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief from the automatic stay in order prosecute 
certain actions against LATAM that are currently pending before the courts of Chile.  LATAM filed 
a brief in opposition to the First Stay Motion, and on December 16, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court heard oral arguments on the First Stay Motion.  At that hearing, the Bankruptcy Court granted the 
First Stay Motion for the limited purpose of allowing CONADECUS to further prosecute its 
pending appeal before the courts of Chile.  On February 9, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court granted the 
Second Stay Motion on the same narrow grounds as the First Stay Motion.  The Bankru ptcy Court’s 
decisions on the First Stay Motion and Second Stay Motion did not affect the underlying 13 
 
 proceedings in Chile beyond allowing CONADECUS to continue its pending appeals (See Note 31 I 2 for any updates this proceedings).  
 Appointment of the Cred itors’ Committee  
 
On June 5, 2020, the United States Trustee for Region 2 appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors (the “Creditors’ Committee”) in the Initial Chapter 11 Cases.  The United States 
Trustee has not solicited additional members f or the Creditors’ Committee as a result of TAM S.A. 
or any of its applicable subsidiaries joining the Bankruptcy Filing.  Since the formation of the Creditors’ Committee, three Creditors’ Committee’s members - Compañía de Seguros de Vida 
Consorcio Nactiona l de Seguros S.A., AerCap Holdings N.V., and Aircastle Limited - have 
resigned from the Creditors’ Committee.  The Office of the United States Trustee has not appointed replacements for these members.  No trustee or examiner has been appointed in any of th ese 
Chapter 11 Cases.  No other official committee have been solicited or appointed.  
 
Assumption, Amendment & Rejection of Executory Contracts & Leases  
 
Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code and the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (the “Bankruptcy 
Rules”),  the Debtors are authorized to assume, assign or reject certain executory contracts and 
unexpired leases.  Absent certain exceptions, the Debtors’ rejection of an executory contract or an 
unexpired lease is generally treated as prepetition breach, which en titles the contract counterparty to 
file a general unsecured claim against the Debtors and simultaneously relives the Debtors from their future obligations under the contract or lease.  Further, the Debtors’ assumption of an executory 
contract or unexpired  lease would generally require the Debtors to satisfy certain prepetition 
amounts due and owning under such contract or lease.  
 
On June 28, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court authorized the Debtors to establish procedures for the rejection of certain executory co ntracts and unexpired leases.  In accordance with these rejection 
procedures, the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules the Debtors have or will reject certain 
contracts and leases (see notes 17, 19 and 27).  Relatedly, the Bankruptcy Court approved the  
Debtors’ request to extend the date by which the Debtors may assume or reject unexpired non -
residential, real property leases until December 22, 2020.  Following consent of certain lessors to 
further extend the deadline in order to finalize productive neg otiations, the Bankruptcy Court 
granted the Debtors’ motions to assume multiple airport leases at Miami -Dade, LAX and JFK 
related to the Debtors’ passenger and cargo businesses.   
 
The Debtors have also assumed a number of important agreements.  For exampl e, on June 1, 2021, 
the Bankruptcy Court approved the assumption and ratification of certain purchase agreements, as amended, with The Boeing Company.  In addition, on July 1, 2021, the Court approved the Debtors’ assumption of the Export Credit Agency -backed fleets, which comprises 65 total aircraft. 
On December 15, 2021, the Debtors filed a motion for an order approving streamlined procedures for the assumption of executory contracts and unexpired leases.  At the December 29, 2021 hearing, 
the Bankruptcy Court granted the Debtors’ motion.

(ii) 1 Rolls -Royce International Aero Engine

As of December 31, 2021, and as a result of th ese contract rejections, obligations with the lenders 
and lessors were extinguished and the Company lost control over the related assets resulting in the derecognition of the assets and the liabilities associated with these aircraft.  See note 17, 19 and 2 7.  
All accounting effects were recorded as Restructuring activities expenses during the year ending 
December 31, 2020 and 2021 as Restructuring activities expenses.

 Other Key Filings  
 
On August 5, 2021, the Debtors filed two motions seeking to (i) approve certain restructuring 
arrangements with Airbus S.A.S. and Banco Santander, S.A. and ( ii) to assume certain purchase 
agreements with Airbus S.A.S.  Orders approving these motions were entered on August 27, 2021.   
In addition, on August 5, 2021, the Debtors filed a motion seeking authorization to enter into a sale 
and leaseback transaction with Sky Aero Management Ltd., pursuant to which the Debtors will sell 
and leaseback certain aircraft purchased in the Airbus purchase agreements that were assumed.  In addition, on August 5, 2021 the Debtors filed a motion seeking authorization to purchas e certain 
aircraft from Wacapou Leasing S.A.  Orders approving both of these motions were entered on 
August 30, 2021.   
 
On June 16, 2021 Banco del Estado de Chile (“BancoEstado”) filed a motion seeking to set a 
briefing and discovery schedule in connectio n with BancoEstado’s separate motion to substantively 
consolidating the estates of LATAM Airlines Group S.A., LATAM Finance Ltd. and Peuco Finance 
Ltd (the “Substantive Consolidation Motion”).  BancoEstado filed the BancoEstado Motion on June 
18, 2021.  On  June 23, 2021, the Debtors as well as certain other interested parties each filed an 
objection to BancoEstado’s motion.  BancoEstado filed a reply in response to such objections on July 19, 2021.  The Bankruptcy Court denied BancoEstado’s motion to set a briefing and discovery 
schedule on July 22, 2021, but the Bankruptcy Court indicated that BancoEstado could resubmit 
their motion as an objection to the Disclosure Statement.  
 On June 16, 2021, the Creditors’ Committee filed two motions seeking standing to  prosecute certain 
claims on behalf of the Debtors against Delta Airlines, Inc. (the “ Delta Motion ”) and Qatar Airways 
O.C.S.C. (the “ Qatar Motion ”), and, together with the Delta Motion, (the “ Standing Motions ”), 
which were opposed by certain parties.  The  Standing Motions were scheduled to be heard at a 
hearing on July 30, 2021.  The Bankruptcy Court proposed that the parties mediate certain matters related to the claims raised in the Standing Motions in the first instance.  The Bankruptcy Court 
asked that  the parties coordinate to select a mediator and establish a proposed plan for the 
mediation.  On August 31, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order appointing the Honorable Allan L. Gropper (Ret.) as mediator, and the parties subsequently began mediat ing these matters.  
On October 15, 2021, the mediator issued a notice terminating the mediation, noting that the 
mediation had failed.  The Creditors’ Committee has asked the Bankruptcy Court to re -schedule a 
hearing on the Standing Motions on the Bankrupt cy Court’s next available hearing date.  
 
On September 10, 2021, the Debtors filed a motion to assume various aircraft agreements and for related relief in connection with the Triton, Centaurus and JOLCO aircraft. The motion was

 Statements and Schedules  
 
Since September 8, 2020, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court schedules and statements of 
financial affairs settin g forth, among other things, the assets and liabilities of the Debtors (the 
“Statements and Schedules”).  The Statements and Schedules are prepared according to the 
requirements of applicable bankruptcy law and are subject to further amendment or modificat ion by 
the Debtors.  On August 13, 2021 and December 3, 2021, the Debtors filed amended schedules.  The Company is also required to file “Monthly Operating Reports” (MOR), to account for the 
receipt, administration and disposition of property during the pe ndency of the Chapter 11 Cases.  
 
Although the Debtors believe that these materials provide the information required under the 
Bankruptcy Code or orders of the Bankruptcy Court, they are nonetheless unaudited and prepared in 
a format different from the con solidated financial reports historically prepared by LATAM in 
accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards).  Certain of the information 
contained in the Statements and Schedules may be prepared on an unconsolidated basis.  
Accordingly , the Debtors believe that the substance and format of these materials do not allow 
meaningful comparison with their regularly publicly -disclosed consolidated financial statements. 
Moreover, the materials filed with the Bankruptcy Court are not prepared fo r the purpose of 
providing a basis for an investment decision relating to the Debtors’ securities, or claims against the 
Debtors, or for comparison with other financial information required to be reported under applicable 
securities law.  
 Intercompany and Affiliate Transactions 
 The Debtors are authorized to continue performing certain postpetition intercompany and affiliate 
transactions in the ordinary course of business, including transactions with non -debtor affiliates, and 
to honor obligations in connec tion with such transactions; provided, however, the Debtors shall not 
make any cash payments on account of prepetition transactions with affiliates absent permission from the Bankruptcy Court, including any repayments on any prepetition loans to non -debtor  
affiliates pursuant to any such transactions.  Out of an abundance of caution, the Debtors have also sought and received Bankruptcy Court approval to contribute capital, capitalize intercompany debt and issue shares between certain debtor affiliates.  
 Debtor in Possession Financing  
 On September 19, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the Debtors to obtain postpetition “debtor -in-possession financing” in the form of a multi -draw term loan facility in an 
aggregate principal amount of up to US$2.45 billion (See note 3.1 c)).  On October 18, 2021, the 
Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving a third tranche of secured financing for $750 million, 
as provided for in the DIP Credit Agreement. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021, the Debtor s 
have secured a DIP Facility in the total aggregate amount of up to $3.2 billion.  
 
Establishment of Bar Dates 
 On September 24, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Bar Date Order”) establishing 
December 18, 2020, as the general deadline (the  “General Bar Date”) by which persons or entities 
who believe they hold any claims against any Debtor that arose prior to the Petition Date, as applicable to each Debtor, must have submitted written documentation of such claims (a “Proof of Claim”).  The G eneral Bar Date was not applicable to governmental units, which must have 19 
 
 submitted Proofs of Claims by January 5, 2021 (the “Governmental Bar Date”).  Finally, as more fully described in the Bar Date Order, claims with respect to rejected contracts or une xpired leases 
may be subject to a deadline later than the General Bar Date (the “Rejection Bar Date” and, together with the General Bar Date and the Governmental Bar Date, the “Bar Dates’).  Any person or entity that fails to timely file its Proof of Claim  by the applicable Bar Date will be forever barred from 
asserting their claim and will not receive any distributions made as part of the ultimate plan of reorganization.  Notice of the Bar Dates, as well as instructions on how to file Proof of Claims, 
were  sent to all known creditors and published in various newspapers in the United States and South 
America.  
 On December 17, 2020, the Court entered an order establishing a supplemental bar date of February 
5, 2021 (the “Supplemental Bar Date”), for certain n on-U.S. claimants not otherwise subject to the 
General Bar Date. The Supplemental Bar Date applies only to those entities and individuals specifically identified in the court order.  Any person or entity that fails to timely file its Proof of Claim by the Supplemental Bar Date will be forever barred from asserting their claim and will not 
receive any distributions made as part of the ultimate plan of reorganization.  
 
Following the close of the General Bar Date and the Supplemental Bar Date, the Debtors have  
continued the process of reconciling approximately 6,400 submitted claims, including those related 
to the Debtors fleet obligations, and have developed procedures to streamline the claims process.  
The Company has already filed objections to a number of c laims and anticipates continuing to do so 
in the coming months.  Although many objections have been entered on an omnibus basis, some claims disputes will likely require individualized adjudication by the Bankruptcy Court.  Further, on 
March 18, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving alternative dispute resolution 
procedures to resolves certain claims disputes outside of the Bankruptcy Court.  As of December 
23, 2021, the Debtors have objected to or have resolved through claims withdrawals, s tipulations 
and court orders approximately 3,400 claims with a total value of approximately US$60 billion.  As 
noted above, the Debtors have entered into claims stipulations in connection with their lease 
amendment agreements.    As the Debtors continue to  reconcile claims against the Company’s 
books and records, they will object to and contest such claims that they determine are not valid or asserted in the proper amount and will resolve other claims disputes in and outside of the Bankruptcy Court.  
A Claim  is recorded as a liability when it has a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as 
a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation amount  can be made. As of December 31, 2021 
approximately 3,568 of the Claims filed against Latam are still being reconciled and so at this time 
the amounts of such Claims cannot be reliably estimated.  
 2.2. Basis of Consolidation  
 (a) Subsidiaries  
 
Subsidiaries are all the entities (including special -purpose entities) over which the Company has the 
power to control the financial and operating policies, which are gener ally accompanied by a holding 
of more than half of the voting rights. In evaluating whether the Company controls another entity, 
the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible at the 
date of the consolidat ed financial statements are considered. The subsidiaries are consolidated from 
the date on which control is passed to the Company and they are excluded from the consolidation 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 18420 
 
 on the date they cease to be so controlled. The results and flows are incorporate d from the date of 
acquisition.  
 
Balances, transactions and unrealized gains on transactions between the Company’s entities are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment loss of the asset tr ansferred. When necessary in order to ensure uniformity with the 
policies adopted by the Company, the accounting policies of the subsidiaries are modified.  
 
To account for and identify the financial information revealed when carrying out a business combina tion, such as the acquisition of an entity by the Company, is apply the acquisition method 
provided for in IFRS 3: Business combination.  
 
(b) Transactions with non -controlling interests  
 
The Group applies the policy of considering transactions with non -controlling interests, when not 
related to loss of control, as equity transactions without an effect on income.  
 
(c) Sales of subsidiaries  
 
When a subsidiary is sold and a percentage of participation is not retained, the Company 
derecognizes assets and liabil ities of the subsidiary, the non -controlling and other components of 
equity related to the subsidiary. Any gain or loss resulting from the loss of control is recognized in the consolidated income statement by function in Other gains (losses).  
 If LATAM Air lines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries retain an ownership of participation in the sold 
subsidiary, and does not represent control, this is recognized at fair value on the date that control is 
lost, the amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive incom e are accounted as if the 
Company had disposed directly from the assets and related liabilities, which can cause these 
amounts are reclassified to profit or loss. The percentage retained valued at fair value is 
subsequently accounted using the equity metho d. 
 
(d) Investees or associates  
 Investees or associates are all entities over which LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries 
have significant influence but have no control. This usually arises from holding between 20% and 
50% of the voting rights. Inves tments in associates are booked using the equity method and are 
initially recognized at their cost.  
 2.3. Foreign currency transactions  
 (a) Presentatio n and functional currencies  
  
The items included in the financial statements of each of the entities of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries are valued using the currency of the main economic environment in which the 
entity operates (the functional c urrency). The functional currency of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. 
is the United States dollar which is also the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries.  
 21 
 
 (b) Transactions and balances 
 Foreign currency transactions are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rates on 
the transaction dates. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the liquidation of these 
transactions and from the translation at the closing exchange r ates of the monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency are shown in the consolidated statement of income by function except when deferred in Other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.  
 (c) Adjustment due to hyperinflati on 
 
After July 1, 2018, the Argentine economy was considered, for purposes of IFRS, hyperinflationary. 
The consolidated financial statements of the subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Argentine 
Peso have been restated.  
 
The non -monetary items of the statement of financial position as well as the income statement, 
comprehensive incomes and cash flows of the group's entities, whose functional currency corresponds to a hyperinflationary economy, adjusted for inflation and re -expressed in accordance 
with the variation of the consumer price index ("CPI"), at each presentation date of its financial 
statements. The re -expression of non -monetary items is made from the date of initial recognition in 
the statements of financial position and considering that,  the financial statements are prepared under 
the historical cost criterion.  
 
Net losses or gains arising from the re -expression of non -monetary items and income and costs  
recognized in the consolidated income statement under "Result of indexation units".  
 
Net gains and losses on the re -expression of opening balances due to the initial application of IAS 
29 are recognized in the consolidated retained earnings.  
 
Re-expression due to hyperinflation will be recorded until the period or exercise in which the 
economy of the entity ceases to be considered as a hyperinflationary economy, at that time, the 
adjustments made by hyperinflation will be part of the cost of non -monetary assets and liabilities. 
The comparative amounts in the consolidated financial statemen ts of the Company are presented in 
a stable currency and are not adjusted for subsequent changes in the price level or exchange rates.  
 
(d) Group entities  
 
The results and the financial situation of the Group's entities, whose functional currency is differ ent 
from the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements, of LATAM Airlines Group S.A., which does not correspond to the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, are converted into 
the currency of presentation as follows:  
 
(i) Assets and  liabilities of each consolidated statement of financial position presented are 
translated at the closing exchange rate on the consolidated statement of financial position date;  
 
(ii) The revenues and expenses of each income statement account are translat ed at the exchange 
rates prevailing on the transaction dates, and  
 
(iii) All the resultant exchange differences by conversion are shown as a separate component in 
other comprehensive income, within "Gain (losses) from exchange rate difference, before tax".  
 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 18522 
 
 For those subsidiaries of the group whose functional currency is different from the presentation 
currency and, moreover, corresponds to the currency of a hyperinflationary economy; its restated 
results, cash flow and financial situation are converted to the presentation currency at the closing 
exchange rate on the date of the consolidated financial statements.  
 The exchange rates used correspond to those fixed in the country where the subsidiary is located, 
whose functional currency is different to the U. S. dollar.  
    
Adjustments to the Goodwill and fair value arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate or 
period informed, restated when the cur rency came from the functional entity of the foreign entity 
corresponds to that of a hyperinflationary economy, the adjustments for the restatement of goodwill 
are recognized in the consolidated equity. 
 2.4. Property, plant and equipment  
 The land of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries, are recognized at cost less any 
accumulated impairment loss. The rest of the Properties, plants and equipment are  recorded, both in 
their initial recognition and in their subsequent measurement, at their historical cost, restated for 
inflation when appropriate, less the corresponding depreciation and any loss due to deterioration.  
 The amounts of advances paid to the  aircraft manufacturers are activated by the Company under 
Construction in progress until they are received.  
 
Subsequent costs (replacement of components, improvements, extensions, etc.) are included in the 
value of the initial asset or are recognized as a  separate asset, only when it is probable that the 
future economic benefits associated with the elements of property, plant and equipment, they will 
flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. The value of the replaced 
componen t is written off. The rest of the repairs and maintenance are charged to the result of the 
year in which they are incurred. The depreciation of the properties, plants and equipment is calculated using the linear method over their estimated technical useful  lives; except in the case of certain technical components which are 
depreciated on the basis of cycles and hours flown. This charge is recognized in the captions "Cost of sale" and "Administrative expenses".  
 The residual value and the useful life of the assets are reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, once a 
year.  Useful lives are detailed in Note 17 (d).  
 When the value of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, its value is immediately 
reduced to its recoverable amount.  
 
Losses and gains from the sale of property, plant and equipment are calculated by comparing the 
consideration with the book value and are included in the consolidated statement of income.  
 23 
 
 2.5. Intangible assets other than goodwill  
 
(a) Airport slots and Loyalty program  
 
Airport slots and the Loyalty program correspond to intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
and are annually tested for impairment as an integral part of the CGU Air Transport.  
 Airport Slots correspond to an administrative authorization to carry out operations of arrival and 
departure of aircraft, at a specific airport, within a certain period of time.  
 
The Loyalty program corresponds to the system  of accumulation and exchange of points that is part 
of TAM Linhas Aereas S.A.  
 
The airport slots and Loyalty program were recognized at fair value under IFRS 3, as a consequence of the business combination with TAM S.A. and Subsidiaries.  
 (b) Computer software  
 Licenses for computer software acquired are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred in acquiring them and preparing them for using the specific software. These costs are amortized over 
their estimated useful lives, for which the Company has been  defined useful lives between 3 and 10 
years.  
 
Expenses related to the development or maintenance of computer software which do not qualify for 
capitalization, are shown as an expense when incurred. The personnel costs and others cost directly 
related to the production of unique and identifiable computer software controlled by the Company, 
are shown as intangible Assets others than Goodwill when they have met all the criteria for 
capitalization.  
 (c) Brands    
 
The Brands were acquired in the business combi nation with TAM S.A. and Subsidiaries and, 
recognized at fair value under IFRS 3. The Company has defined a useful life of five years, period in which the value of the brands will be amortized. 
 
2.6. Goodwill  
 
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Company’s 
participation in the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary or associate  on the acquisition date. 
Goodwill related to acquisition  of subsidiaries is not amortized but tested for impairment annually 
or each time that there is evidence of impairment. Gains and losses on the sale of an entity include the book amount of the goodwill related to the entity sold.  
 2.7. Borrowing costs  
 Interest costs incurred for the construction of any qualified asset are capitalized over the time 
necessary for completing and preparing the asset for its intended use. Other interest costs are 
recognized in the consolidated statement of income by function when accrued.  
 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 18624 
 
 2.8. Losses for impairment of non -financial assets  
 
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and 
are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Asse ts subject to amortization are tested for impairment losses 
whenever any event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset 
over it s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the fair value of an asset less the costs for 
sale or the value in use, whichever is  greater. For the purpose of evaluating impairment losses, 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are largel y independent cash inflows (cash 
generating unit. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, that would have suffered an impairment 
loss are reviewed if there are indicators of reversal of losses. Impairment losses are recognized in 
the consolidated statem ent of income by function under "Other gains (losses)".  
 
2.9. Financial assets  
 The Company classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value  (either through 
other comprehensive income, or through gains or losses), and at amortized cost. The classification depends on the business model of the entity to manage the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.  
 The group reclassif ies debt investments when, and only when, it changes its business model to 
manage those assets.  
 
In the initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of 
a financial asset classified at amortized cost, the t ransaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets accounted for at fair value 
through profit or loss are recorded as expenses in the consolidated statement of income by function . 
 (a) Debt instruments  
 
The subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the group's business model to manage 
the asset and cash flow characteristics of the asset. The Company has two measurement categories 
in which the group classifies its debt instruments:  
 Amortized cost: the assets held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent only payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost. A gain or loss on 
a debt investment that is subsequently mea sured at amortized cost and is not part of a hedging 
relationship is recognized in income when the asset is derecognized or impaired. Interest income 
from these financial assets is included in financial income using the effective interest rate method.  
 
Fair value through profit or loss: assets that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or fair value 
trought other comprehensive income are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not 
part of a hedging relationship is recognized in profit or loss and is presented net in the consolidated statement of income by function within other gains / (losses) in the period or exercise in which it 
arises.  
 25 
 
 (b) Equity instruments  
 Changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in 
other gains / (losses) in the consolidated statement of income by function as appropriate.  
 
The Company evaluates in advance the  expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments 
recorded at amortized cost. The applied impairment methodology depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.  
 
2.10. Derivative financial instruments and hedging activit ies 
 Until December 31, 2020 the Company recognized the hedging derivatives in accordance with IAS 
39, as of January 1, 2021 t he Company changed the recognition of these derivatives in accordance 
with IFRS 9 and continues to recognize under this same standard the derivatives that do not qualify 
as hedges.  
 Initially at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract was m ade and are subsequently 
valued at their fair value. The method to recognize the resulting loss or gain depends on whether the derivative designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.  
  
The Company designates certain d erivatives as:  
 (a) Hedge of an identified risk associated with a recognized liability or an expected                  
highly - Probable transaction (cash -flow hedge), or  
(b) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.  
 
At the beginning of the tr ansaction, the Company documents the economic relationship between the 
hedged items existing between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its 
objectives for risk management and the strategy to carry out various hedging operations. The 
Company also documents its assessment, both at the beginning and on an ongoing basis, as to 
whether the derivatives used in the hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the 
changes in the fair value or cash flows of the items being hedged.  
 The total fair value of the hedging derivatives is booked as Other non -current financial asset or 
liability if the remaining maturity of the item hedged is over 12 months, and as an other current financial asset or liability if the remaining term of the ite m hedged is less than 12 months.  
Derivatives not booked as hedges are classified as Other financial assets or liabilities.  
 (a) Cash flow hedges  
 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow  hedges is shown in the statement of other comprehensive income. The loss or gain 
relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income by function under other gains (losses). Amounts accumulated in equity ar e reclassified to 
profit or loss in the periods or exercise when the hedged item affects profit or loss.  
 
For fuel price hedges, the amounts shown in the statement of other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to results under the line item Cost of sales to the extent that the fuel subject to the hedge 
is used.  
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 18726 
 
 Gains or losses related to the effective part of the change in the intrinsic value of the options are 
recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Changes in the time value of the option s 
related to the part are recognized within Other Consolidated Comprehensive Income in the costs of the hedge reserve within equity.  
 
When hedging instrument mature, is sold or fails to meet the requirements to be accounted for as 
hedges, any gain or loss accumulated in the statement of Other comprehensive income until that 
moment, remains in the statement of other comprehensive income and is reclassified to the consolidated statement of income when the hedged transaction is finally recognized.  
 
When it is  expected that the hedged transaction is no longer going to occur, the gain or loss 
accumulated in the statement of other comprehensive income is taken immediately to the 
consolidated statement of income by function as “Other gains (losses)”.  
 
(b) Derivati ves not booked as a hedge  
 The changes in fair value of any derivative instrument that is not booked as a hedge are shown 
immediately in the consolidated statement of income in “Other gains (losses)”.  
 
2.11. Inventories  
 Inventories, are shown at the lower of cost and their net realizable value. The cost is determined on 
the basis of the weighted average cost method (WAC). The net realizable value is the estimated 
selling price in the normal course of business, less estimated costs necessary to make the sale.  
 2.12.  Trade and other accounts receivable  
 
Commercial ac counts receivable are initially recognized at their fair value and subsequently at their 
amortized cost in accordance with the effective rate method, less the provision for impairment according to the model of the expected credit losses. The Company applie s the simplified approach 
permitted by IFRS 9, which requires that expected lifetime losses be recognized upon initial 
recognition of accounts receivable.  
 In the event that the Company transfers its rights to any financial asset (generally accounts 
receivable) to a third party in exchange for a cash payment, the Company evaluates whether all 
risks and rewards have been transferred, in which case the account receivable is derecognized.  
 
The existence of significant financial difficulties on the part of the debtor, the probability that the 
debtor goes bankrupt or financial reorganization are considered indicators of a significant increase 
in credit risk.  
 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced as the provision account is used and the loss is 
recognized i n the consolidated income statement under "Cost of sales". When an account receivable 
is written off, it is regularized against the provision account for the account receivable.  
 
2.13. Cash and cash equivalents  
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and bank balances, time deposits in financial institutions, and other short -term and highly liquid investments and a low risk of loss of value.  27 
 
 2.14. Capital  
 
The common shares are classified as net equity.  
 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or options are shown in net 
equity as a deduction from th e proceeds received from the placement of shares.  
 2.15. Trade and other accounts payables  
 
Trade payables and other accounts payable are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently at 
amortized cost.  
 
2.16. Interest -bearing loans  
 
Financial liabilities are shown initially at their fair value, net  of the costs incurred in the transaction. 
Later, these financial liabilities are valued at their amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds obtained (net of the necessary arrangement costs) and the repayment value, is shown in 
the consolidated st atement of income during the term of the debt, according to the effective interest 
rate method.  
 Financial liabilities are classified in current and non -current liabilities according to the contractual 
payment dates of the nominal principal.  
2.17. Current  and deferred taxes  
 The tax expense for the period or exercise comprises income and deferred taxes.  
 
The current income tax expense is calculated based on  tax laws in enacted the date of statement of 
financial position, in the countries in which the subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.  
 
Deferred taxes are recognized, on the temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an assets or a 
liability in transaction other than a business combina tion that at the time of the transaction does not 
affect the accounting or the taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates (and 
laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the date of the consolidated statements of 
financial position, and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realized or the 
deferred tax liability discharged.  
 
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent it is probable that the future taxable profit will be available ag ainst which the temporary differences can be utilized.  
 The tax (current and deferred) is recognized in statement of income by function, unless it relates to 
an item recognized in other comprehensive income, directly in equity. In this case the tax is also  
recognized in other comprehensive income or, directly in the statement of income by function, respectively .

 2.18. Employee benefits  
  
(a)  Personnel vacations  
 
The Company recognizes the expense for personnel vacations on an accrual basis.   
 (b)  Share -based compensation  
 The compensation plans implemented based on the shares of the Company are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with  IFRS 2: Share -based payments, for plans 
based on the granting of options, the effect of fair value is recorded in equity with a charge to remuneration in a linear manner between the date of grant of said options and the date on which 
they become irrevocab le, for the plans considered as cash settled award the fair value, updated as of 
the closing date of each reporting period or exercise, is recorded as a liability with charge to 
remuneration.  
 (c)        Post -employment and other long -term benefits  
 Provis ions are made for these obligations by applying the method of the projected unit credit 
method, and considering estimates of future permanence, mortality rates and future wage increases 
determined on the basis of actuarial calculations. The discount rates are determined by reference to 
market interest -rate curves. Actuarial gains or losses are shown in other comprehensive income.  
 
(d)  Incentives  
 The Company has an annual incentives plan for its personnel for compliance with objectives and 
individual contr ibution to the results. The incentives eventually granted consist of a given number 
or portion of monthly remuneration and the provision is made on the basis of the amount estimated 
for distribution.   
 (e)  Termination benefits  
 
The group recognizes termi nation benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the group 
terminates laboral relation; and (b) when the entity recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of terminations benefits.  
 
2.19.  Provisions  
 Provisions are recognized when:  
 (i) The Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event;  
 
(ii) It is probable that paymen t is going to be required to settle an obligation; and  
 (iii) A reliable estimate of the obligation amount can be made.   
 2.20. Revenue from contracts with customers  
 
(a) Transportation of passengers and cargo  29 
 
  The Company recognizes the sale for the transportation service as a deferred income liability, 
which is recognized as income when the transportation service has been lent or expired. In the case 
of air tran sport services sold by the Company and that will be made by other airlines, the liability is 
reduced when they are remitted to said airlines. The Company periodically reviews whether it is 
necessary to make an adjustment to deferred income liabilities, mai nly related to returns, changes, 
among others.  
 
Compensations granted to clients for changes in the levels of services or billing of additional services such as additional baggage, change of seat, among others, are considered modifications of 
the initial c ontract, therefore, they are deferred until the corresponding service is provided.  
 
(b) Expiration of air tickets  
 
The Company estimates in a monthly basis the probability of expiration of air tickets, with refund 
clauses, based on the history of use of th e same. Air tickets without refund clause are expired on the 
date of the flight in case the passenger does not show up.  
 
(c) Costs associated with the contract  
 
The costs related to the sale of air tickets are activated and deferred until the moment of pro viding 
the corresponding service. These assets are included under the heading "Other current non -financial 
assets" in the Consolidated Classified Statement of Financial Position.  
 (d) Frequent passenger program  
 
The Company maintains the following loyalty programs: LATAM Pass and LATAM Pass Brasil, 
whose objective is building customer loyalty through the delivery of miles or points.  
 
These programs give their frequent passengers the possibility of earning LATAMPASS’s miles or 
points, which grant the right t o a selection of both air and non -air awards. Additionally, the 
Company sells the LATAMPASS miles or points to financial and non -financial partners through 
commercial alliances to award miles or points to their customers.  
 
To reflect the miles and points e arned, the loyalty program mainly includes two types of 
transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations: (1) 
Passenger Ticket Sales Earning miles or points (2) miles or points sold to financial and non -
financial partner  
 
(1) Passenger Ticket Sales Earning Miles or Points.  
In this case, the miles or points are awarded to customers at the time that the company performs the 
flight.  
 
To value the miles or points earned with travel, we consider the quantitative value a passenger 
receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash, which is referred to as Equivalent Ticket Value ("ETV"). Our estimate of ETV is adjusted for miles and point that are not likely to be 
redeemed ("breakage").  
 
The balance of mil es and point that are pending to redeem are include on deferred revenue.  
 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 18930 
 
 (2) Miles sold to financial and non -financial partner  
 
To value the miles or points earns through financial and non -financial partners,the performance 
obligations with the client are  estimated separately. To calculate these performance obligations, 
different components that add value in the commercial contract must be considered, such as 
marketing, advertising and other benefits, and finally the value of the points awarded to customer s 
based on our ETV. The value of each of these components is finally allocated in proportion to their 
relative prices. The performance obligations associated with the valuation of the points or miles 
earned become part of the Deferred Revenue, and the rema ining performance obligations, are 
recorded as revenue when the  miles or points are delivered to the client.  
 
When the miles and points are exchanged for products and services other than the services provided by the Company, the income is recognized immed iately, when the exchange is made for air tickets 
of any airline of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and subsidiaries, the income is deferred until the air transport service is provided.  
 
The miles and points that the Company estimates will not be exchanged are recognized in the 
results based on the consumption pattern of the miles or points effectively exchanged by customers. 
The Company uses statistical models to estimate the probability of exchange, which is based on 
historical patterns and projections.  
 (e) D ividend income  
 
Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.  
 2.21. Leases  
 The Company recognizes contracts that meet the definition of a l ease, as a right of use asset and a 
lease liability on the date when the underlying asset is available for use.  
 
Assets for right of use are measured at cost including the following:  
 
- The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;  
- Lease paym ent made at or before commencement date;  
- Initial direct costs, and 
- Restoration costs.  
 
The assets by right of use are recognized in the statement of financial position in Properties, plants 
and equipment.  
 
Lease liabilities include the net present value of  the following payments:  
 
- Fixed payments including in substance fixed payment.  
- Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate;  
- The exercise price of a purchase options, if is reasonably certain to exercise that option.  
 
The Company determines th e present value of the lease payments using the implicit rates for the 
aircraft leasing contracts and for the rest of the underlying assets, uses the incremental borrowing 
rate. 
 31 
 
 Lease liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position under  Other financial 
liabilities, current or non -current.  
 
Interest accrued on financial liabilities is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in "Financial costs".  
 Principal and interest are present in the consolidated cash flow as "Payments of  lease liability" and 
"Interest paid", respectively, in cash flows use in financing activities  
 Payments associated with short -term leases without purchase options and leases of low -value assets 
are recognized on a straight -line basis in profit or loss at the time of accrual. Those payments are 
presented in cash flows use in operation activities.  
 The Company analyzes the financing agreements of aircrafts, mainly considering characteristics such as:  
 (a) that the Company initially acquired the aircraft or took an important part in the process of direct 
acquisition with the manufacturers.  
  (b) Due to the contractual conditions, it is virtually certain that the Company will execute the 
purchase option of the aircraft at the end of the lease term.  
 Since the se financing agreements are “substantially purchases” and not leases, the related liability 
is considered as a financial debt classified under to IFRS 9 and continue to be presented within the “Other financial liabilities” described in Note 19. On the othe r hand, the aircraft are presented in 
Property, Plants and Equipment, as described in Note 17, as “own aircraft”.  
 The Group qualifies as sale and lease transactions, operations that lead to a sale according to IFRS 
15. More specifically, a sale is conside red as such if there is no option to purchase the goods at the 
end of the lease term.  
 If the sale by the seller -lessee is classified as a sale in accordance with IFRS 15, the underlying 
asset is derecognized, and a right -of-use asset equal to the portion retained proportionally of the 
amount of the asset is recognized.  
 If the sale by the seller -lessee is not classified as a sale in accordance with IFRS 15, the transferred 
assets are kept in the financial statements and a financial liability equal to the s ale price is 
recognized (received from the buyer -lessor).  
 
The Company has applied the practical solution allowed by IFRS 16 for those contracts that meet 
the established requirements and that allows a lessee to choose not to evaluate if the concessions that it obtains derived from COVID -19 are a modification of the lease.

 2.22. Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale  
 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as assets held for sale are shown at the lesser of 
their book value and the fair value less costs to sell.  
 2.23. Maintenance 
 The costs incurred for scheduled heavy maintenance of the aircraft’s fuselage and engines are 
capitalized and depreciated until the next maintenance. The depreciation rate is determined on technical grounds, according to the use of the aircraft expressed in terms of cycles and flight hours.  
 In case of aircraft include in property, plant and equipment, these maintenance cost are capitalized 
as Property, plant and equipment, while in the case of aircraft on right of use,  a liability is accrued 
based on the use of the main components is recognized, since a contractual obligation with the 
lessor to return the aircraft on agreed terms of maintenance levels exists. These are recognized as 
Cost of sales.  
 Additionally, some co ntracts that comply with the definition of lease establish the obligation of the 
lessee to make deposits to the lessor as a guarantee of compliance with maintenance and return 
conditions. These deposits, often called maintenance reserves, accumulate until a major 
maintenance is performed, once made, the recovery is requested to the lessor. At the end of the contract period, there is comparison between the reserves that have been paid and required return 
conditions, and compensation between the parties are m ade if applicable.  
 The unscheduled maintenance of aircraft and engines, as well as minor maintenance, are charged to 
results as incurred.  
 
2.24.  Environmental costs  
 Disbursements related to environmental protection are charged to results when incurred or accrue.  33 
 
 NOTE 3 - FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
 3.1. Financial risk factors 
 
The Company is exposed to different financial risks: (a) market risk, (b) credit risk, and (c) 
liquidity risk. The program overall risk management of the Company aims to minimize the adverse 
effects of financial risks affe cting the company.  
 (a)  Market risk  
 
Due to the nature of its operations, the Company is exposed to market factors such as: (i) fuel -price 
risk, (ii) exchange -rate risk (FX), and (iii) interest -rate risk.  
 
The Company has developed policies and procedur es for managing market risk, which aim to 
identify, quantify, monitor and mitigate the adverse effects of changes in market factors mentioned 
above.  
 For the foregoing, Management monitors the evolution of fuel price levels, exchange rates and 
interest rat es, quantifies exposures and their risk, and develops and executes hedging strategies.  
 
(i) Fuel-price risk:  
 
Exposure:  
 For the execution of its operations the Company purchases a fuel called Jet Fuel grade 54 USGC, 
which is subject to the fluctuations of int ernational fuel prices.  
 
Mitigation:  
 To hedge the risk exposure fuel, the Company operates with derivative instruments (swaps and 
options) whose underlying assets may be different from Jet Fuel, such as West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude, Brent (“BRENT ”) crude and distillate Heating Oil (“HO”), which have a high 
correlation with Jet Fuel and greater liquidity.  
 
Fuel Hedging Results:  
 
As of December 31 , 2021, the Company recognized profit of US$ 10.1 million for fuel hedge net of 
premiums in the costs of  sale for the year. During the same period of 2020, the Company 
recognized losses of US$ 14,3 million for the same concept.  
 As of December 31 , 2021  the market value of the fuel positions was US$ 17.6 million (positive). At 
the end of December 2020, this m arket value was US$ 1.3 million (positive).

 (*)   The volume shown in the table considers all the hedging instruments (swaps and options).  
 Sensitivity analysis  
 
A drop in fuel price positively affects the Company through a re duction in costs. However, also 
negatively affects contracted positions as these are acquired to protect the Company against the risk 
of a rise in price. The policy therefore is to maintain a hedge -free percentage in order to be 
competitive in the event of  a drop in price.  
 The current hedge positions are booked as cash flow hedge contracts, so a variation in the fuel price 
has an impact on the Company’s net equity.  
 
The following tables show the sensitivity of financial instruments according to reasonable changes 
in the price of fuel and their effect on equity.  
 The calculations were made considering a parallel movement of US$ 5 per barrel in the underlying 
reference price curve at the end of December 2021 and the end of December 2020. The projection 
period was defined until the end of the last fuel hedging contract in force, corresponding to the last 
business day of the fourth quarter of the year 2022.

 Given the fuel hedging structure during half – year 2021, which considers a portion free of hedges, 
a vertical drop of 5 dollars in the JET reference pric e (considered as the monthly daily average), 
would have meant an impact of approximately US$ 79.2 million lower fuel cost. For the same 
period, a vertical rise of 5 dollars in the JET reference price (considered as the monthly daily average), would have me ant an approximate impact of US$ 80.8 million in higher fuel costs.

 (ii) Foreign exchange rate risk:  
 
Exposure:  
 
The functional and presentation currency of the financial statements of the Parent Company is the US dollar, so that the risk of the Transact ional and Conversion exchange rate arises mainly from the 
Company's business, strategic and accounting operating activities that are expressed in a monetary unit other than the functional currency.  
 The subsidiaries of LATAM are also exposed to foreign exc hange risk whose impact affects the 
Company's Consolidated Income.  
 The largest operational exposure to LATAM's exchange risk comes from the concentration of 
businesses in Brazil, which are mostly denominated in Brazilian Real (BRL), and are actively 
manag ed by the company.  
 
At a lower concentration, the Company is also exposed to the fluctuation of other currencies, such 
as: Euro, Pound sterling, Australian dollar, Colombian peso, Chilean peso, Argentine peso, 
Paraguayan Guarani, Mexican peso, Peruvian Sol  and New Zealand dollar.  
 
Mitigation : 
 
The Company mitigates currency risk exposures by contracting derivative instruments or through 
natural hedges or execution of internal operations.  
 Exchange Rate Hedging Results (FX) : 
 
With the objective of reducing e xposure to the exchange rate risk in the operational cash flows of 
2021, and securing the operating margin, LATAM makes hedges using FX derivatives.  
 
As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 the Company did not maintain FX derivatives.  
 
During the yea r ended December 31 , 2021,  the Company did not recognize earnings for FX 
coverage net of premiums. During the same period of 2020, the Company recognized gains of                    US$ 3.2 million for FX hedging net of premiums.  
 
As of December 31, 2021 a nd December 31, 2020 the company does not hold FX derivatives that 
are not recognized as hedge accounting.  
 
Sensitivity analysis: 
 
A depreciation of the R$/US$ exchange rate, negatively affects the Company's operating cash 
flows, however, also positively a ffects the value of the positions of derivatives contracted.  
 FX derivatives are recorded as cash flow hedge contracts; therefore, a variation in the exchange rate has an impact on the market value of the derivatives, the changes of which affect the Compan y's net 
equity.  
 
As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 the Company had no current FX derivatives for 
BRL.  
Integrated Report 2021

 In the case of TAM S.A, whose functional currency is the Brazilian real, a large part of its liabilities 
is expressed in US dollars. Therefore , when converting financial assets and liabilities, from dollar to 
real, they have an impact on the result of TAM S.A., which is consolidated in the Company's Income Statement.  
 
In order to reduce the impact on the Company's result caused by appreciations  or depreciations of   
R $ / US $, the Company has executed internal operations to reduce the net exposure in US $ for TAM S.A.  
 
The following table shows the variation in financial results when the R$/US$ exchange rate 
appreciates or depreciates by 10%:

Effects of exchange rate derivatives in the Financial Statements  
 The profit or losses caused by chang es in the fair value of hedging instruments are segregated 
between intrinsic value and temporary value. The intrinsic value is the actual percentage of cash 
flow covered, initially shown in equity and later transferred to income, while the hedge transactio n 
is recorded in income. The temporary value corresponds to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognized in the financial results of the Company (Note 19).  
 
Due to the functional currency of TAM S.A. and Subsidiaries is the Brazilian real , the Company 
presents the effects of the exchange rate fluctuations in Other comprehensive income by converting the Statement of financial position and Income statement of TAM S.A. and Subsidiaries from their 
functional currency to the U.S. dollar, which is the presentation currency of the consolidated 
financial statement of LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and Subsidiaries.

(iii) Interest -rate risk:  
 Exposure:  
 
The Comp any is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates affecting the markets future cash flows of 
the assets, and current and future financial liabilities.  
 
The Company is exposed in one portion to the variations of London Inter -Bank Offer Rate 
(“LIBOR”) and oth er interest rates of less relevance are Brazilian Interbank Deposit Certificate 
("IDC"). Because the publication of LIBOR will cease for June 2023, the company has begun to 37 
 
 migrate to the adoption of SOFR as an alternative rate, which will materialize with  the termination 
of LIBOR.  
 Mitigation : 
 
At the end of December 31 , the Company did not have current interest rate derivative positions. 
Currently a 40% (42% at December 31, 2020) of the debt is fixed to fluctuations in interest rate. 
Most of this debt is indexed to a benchmark rate based on LIBOR.  
 To mitigate the effect of those derivatives that will be affected by the transition from LIBOR to 
SOFR, the Company is evaluating adherence to the ISDA protocol in the case of derivatives and is following the re commendations of the relevant authorities, including the Alternative Reference 
Rates Committee. ("ARRC") in the case of debt, in line with the measures generally adopted by the 
market for the replacement of LIBOR in debt contracts.  
 
Rate Hedging Results : 
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not hold current interest rate derivative positions. At 
the end of December 2020, the Company did not hold current interest rate derivative positions.  
 
Sensitivity analysis: 
  The following table shows the sensitivi ty of changes in financial obligations that are not hedged 
against interest -rate variations. These changes are considered reasonably possible, based on current 
market conditions each date.

As of December 31, 2021 , the Company does not hold current interest rate derivative positions. The 
above calculations were vertically increased (decreased) 100 basis points of the three -month Libor 
future curve, both scenarios being reasonably possible based on historical market  conditions.  
 
The assumptions of sensitivity calculation must assume that forward curves of interest rates do not 
necessarily reflect the real value of the compensation flows. Moreover, the structure of interest rates 
is dynamic over time.  
 
On March 5, 20 21, the ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”) announced that, as a result of little 
access to the information necessary for calculating rates, the publication of the 1 -week, 2 -months 
USD rates will cease to be published on December 31, 2021 and the remainin g terms will cease on 
June 30, 2023. Although the adoption of alternative rates is voluntary, the impending 
discontinuation of LIBOR makes it essential that market participants consider moving to alternative 
rates such as SOFR and that they have appropriat e alternative language in existing contracts that 
reference the discontinuation of LIBOR. In this regard, the Company identifies that its derivative 
and debt contracts may be affected by the change in the relevant rate. To mitigate the effect, the 
Integrated Report 2021

 Company is evaluating adherence to the ISDA protocol in the case of derivatives and is following 
the recommendations of the relevant authorities, including the Alternative Reference Rates 
Committee ("ARRC") in the case of debt, online with the measures generally a dopted by the market 
for the replacement of LIBOR in debt contracts.  
 Currently, the Company only has fuel derivatives with a nominal value equivalent to 21%'s hedge 
of the total consumption expected for the next 12 months.  
 (b) Credit risk  
 
Credit risk oc curs when the counterparty does not meet its obligations to the Company under a 
specific contract or financial instrument, resulting in a loss in the market value of a financial 
instrument (only financial assets, not liabilities). The client portfolio at D ecember 31, 2021 
increased when compared to the balance as of December 31, 2020 by 48%, mainly due to an 
increase in passenger transport operations (travel agencies and corporate) that increased by 124% in 
sales,  mainly from a 68% of credit card payments a nd 32% in cash sales. Instead, the cargo 
business showed a increase in its net income of 23% compared to December 2020. The cargo business increase in its operation in a 23% compared to December 2020. In the case of clients who 
still have pending balances and that the administration considered risky, the corresponding 
measures were taken to consider expected credit loss The provision at the end of December 2021 
had a decrease of 34% compared to December 31, 2020, as a result of the decrease in the portfolio  
for recoveries and for the application of write -offs in the years.  
 
The Company is exposed to credit risk due to its operational activities and its financial activities, 
including deposits with banks and financial institutions, investments in other types of instruments, 
exchange rate transactions and contracting derivative instruments or options.  
  To reduce the credit risk related to operational activities, the Company has implemented credit 
limits to limit the exposure of its debtors, which are permanent ly monitored for the LATAM 
network, when deemed necessary, agencies have been blocked for cargo and passenger businesses.  
 (i) Financial activities  
 Cash surpluses that remain after the financing of assets necessary for the operation are invested 
according to credit limits approved by the Company’s Board, mainly in time deposits with different 
financial institutions, private investment funds, short -term mutual funds, and easily -liquidated 
corporate and sovereign bonds with short remaining maturities. These inve stments are booked as 
Cash and cash equivalents and other current financial assets.  
 
In order to reduce counterparty risk and to ensure that the risk assumed is known and managed by 
the Company, investments are diversified among different banking instituti ons (both local and 
international). The Company evaluates the credit standing of each counterparty and the levels of 
investment, based on (i) their credit rating, (ii) the equity size of the counterparty, and                             
(iii) investment li mits according to the Company’s level of liquidity. According to these three 
parameters, the Company chooses the most restrictive parameter of the previous three and based on this, establishes limits for operations with each counterparty.  
The Company has n o guarantees to mitigate this exposure.  
 39 
 
 Additionally, section 345(b) of the Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code imposes restrictions on, among other things, the institutions where the Debtors can hold their cash. In particular, it 
establishes that cash s hould be held in what are called Authorized Bank Depositories, which are US 
Banking Institutions that are accepted by the US Trustee Program of the US Department of Justice.   
Such Authorized Bank Depositories have generally agreed with the US Trustee Progr am to 
maintain collateral of no less than 115% of the aggregate funds on deposit (in excess of FDIC 
insurance limit) by (i) surety bond or (ii) US Treasury securities. Consequently, pursuant to Section 
345(b), as implemented through an agreement with the O ffice of the United States Trustee, as of 
the year end the Company held the majority of its cash and equivalents in Banks in the US that are 
depositories authorized by Office of the United States Trustee for the Southern District of New 
York. Otherwise, th e DIP Facility contains certain restrictions on new investments made by the 
Debtors during the term of the facility.  
  
(ii)       Operational activities  
 
The Company has four large sales “clusters”: travel agencies, cargo agents, airlines and credit -card 
administrators. The first three are governed by International Air Transport Association, 
international (“IATA”) organization comprising most of the airlines that represent over 90% of 
scheduled commercial traffic and one of its main objectives is to regulat e the financial transactions 
between airlines and travel agents and cargo. When an agency or airline does not pay their debt, 
they are excluded from operating with IATA’s member airlines. In the case of credit -card 
administrators, they are fully guaranteed  by 100% by the issuing institutions.  
 
Under certain of the Company’s credit card processing agreements, the financial institutions have 
the right to require that the Company maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales 
that have been proc essed by that financial institution, but for which the Company has not yet 
provided the air transportation. Additionally, the financial institutions have the ability to require 
additional collateral reserves or withhold payments related to receivables to b e collected if 
increased risk is perceived related to liquidity covenants in these agreements or negative balances occur.  
 
The exposure consists of the term granted, which fluctuates between 1 and 45 days.  
 One of the tools the Company uses for reducing cr edit risk is to participate in global entities related 
to the industry, such as IATA, Business Sales Processing (“BSP”), Cargo Account Settlement Systems (“CASS”), IATA Clearing House (“ICH”) and banks (credit cards). These institutions fulfill the role of  collectors and distributors between airlines and travel and cargo agencies. In the 
case of the Clearing House, it acts as an offsetting entity between airlines for the services provided between them. A reduction in term and implementation of guarantees ha s been achieved through 
these entities. Currently the sales invoicing of TAM Linhas Aéreas S.A. related with travel agents 
and cargo agents for domestic transportation in Brazil is done directly by TAM Linhas Aéreas S.A.  
 
Credit quality of financial assets  
 The external credit evaluation system used by the Company is provided by IATA. Internal systems 
are also used for particular evaluations or specific markets based on trade reports available on the 
local market. The internal classification system is compl ementary to the external one, i.e. for 
agencies or airlines not members of IATA, the internal demands are greater.  
 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 19440 
 
 To reduce the credit risk associated with operational activities, the Company has established credit 
limits to abridge the exposure of thei r debtors which are monitored permanently (mainly in case of 
operational activities of TAM Linhas Aéreas S.A. with travel agents).  The bad -debt rate in the 
principal countries where the Company has a presence is insignificant.  
 
(c) Liquidity risk  
 Liquidit y risk represents the risk that the Company does not have sufficient funds to pay its 
obligations.  
 Due to the cyclical nature of its business, the operation and investment needs, along with the need 
for financing, the Company requires liquid funds, define d as Cash and cash equivalents plus other 
short -term financial assets, to meet its payment obligations. On May 26, 2020, the Company and its 
subsidiaries in Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and the United States began a voluntary process of reorganization an d restructuring of their debt under the protection of the Chapter 11 of the United 
States, to which on July 9, the Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its subsidiaries were included, in order to preserve the group's liquidity. In light of the unprecedented  impact COVID -19 has had on 
the global aviation industry, this reorganization process provides LATAM with the opportunity to work with the group's creditors, and main stakeholders, to reduce its debt and obtain new sources of financing, providing the compa ny with the tools to adapt the group to this new reality.  
 The balance of liquid funds, future cash generation and the ability to obtain financing, provides the 
Company with alternatives to meet future investment and financing commitments.  
 As of December 31, 2021, the balance of liquid funds is US$ 1,047 million (US $ 1,696 million as 
of December 31, 2020), which are invested in short -term instruments through financial entities with 
a high credit rating classification.  
 
As of December 31, 2021, LATAM maint ains a committed revolving credit facility (Revolving 
Credit Facility) for a total amount of US$ 600 million, which is fully drawn. This line is secured by and subject to the availability of collateral (i.e. aircraft, engines and spare parts).  
 
Finally, du ring the fourth quarter of 2021, the company has reduced budgeted investments by 
approximately US$ 146 million, mainly related to maintenance, given the lower operation, purchase of engines, investments in cabins and other projects. In addition, LATAM has not received aircraft 
that it was committed to receiving in 2021, which at the beginning of the year reached US$ 773 
million.  
 After filing Chapter 11 protection, the company received authorization from the Bankruptcy Court 
for the “debtors in possession” (DIP) financing, in the form of a multi -draw term loan facility in an 
aggregate principal amount of up to US$ 3.2 billion divided in Tranche A, B and C. Initially, 
Tranches A and C were committed for a total of US$2.45 billion. To date, these three tranche s are 
fully committed after the approval on October 18 of a proposal to grant financing under Tranche B of the DIP for a total of US$750 million, thus allowing LATAM to access lower financing costs in 
the next disbursements of the DIP financing.  
 1) A Tra nche A, which is committed for up to US$ 1.3 billion, out of which (i) US$ 1.125 billion 
were be provided by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. or certain entities related to it; and           41 
 
 (ii) US$ 175 million were be provided by Knighthead, Jefferies an d / or other entities that are part 
of the syndicate of creditors organized by Jefferies;  
 
2) A Tranche B for an amount up to US $750 million that will be contributed by a group of financiers including Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. and Apollo Management  Holdings, L.P. and 
other certain funds advised by them; and  
 
3) A Tranche C for a capital amount of up to US$ 1.15 billion, of which (i) US$ 750 million was 
provided by a certain group of LATAM's shareholders composed by Grupo Cueto, Grupo Eblen and Qatar  Airways, or certain related entities; (ii) US$ 250 million was provided by Knighthead, 
Jefferies and / or other entities that are part of the syndicate of creditors organized by Jefferies; and (iii) US$ 150 million which was committed by certain additiona l shareholder investors through a 
public investment fund managed by Toesca S.A., through a “joinder” or supplement to the “DIP Agreement” subscripted on November 6, 2020.  
 
In consideration of the extension of the health and mobility restrictions imposed by  the authorities 
in the countries where the group operates, as well as the analysis of the company's liquidity projection, beginning on October 8, 2020, LATAM has made four withdrawals under the DIP 
Credit Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the “DI P Agreement”, Debtors must maintain 
consolidated liquidity of at least US $ 400 million, considering the undrawn line of the DIP, and 
meet certain milestones with respect to the chapter 11 process.

 The Company has fuel, interest rate and exchange rate hedging strategies involving derivatives 
contracts with different financial institutions.  
 
At the end of 2020, the Company had delivered US$ 3 million in guarantees for derivative margins corresponding to cash and stanby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2021, the Compa ny 
maintains guarantees for US$ 5.5 million corresponding to derivative transactions. The increase was due to: i) greater subscription of hedging contracts than their maturity and ii) changes in fuel prices, 
exchange rates and interest rates.  
 
3.2. Capital  risk management  
 The objectives of the Company, in relation to capital management are: (i) to meet the minimum 
equity requirements and (ii) to maintain an optimal capital struc ture. 
 
The Company monitors contractual obligations and regulatory requirements in the different 
countries where the group's companies are domiciled to ensure faithful compliance with the 
minimum equity requirement, the most restrictive limit of which is t o maintain positive liquid 
equity.  
 
Additionally, the Company periodically monitors the short and long term cash flow projections to 
ensure that it has sufficient cash generation alternatives to meet future investment and financing 
commitments.  
 
The intern ational credit rating of the Company is the result of the ability to meet long -term financial 
commitments. As of December 31, 2021, and as a consequence of the expected decline in demand due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the Company's filing for voluntary p rotection under the U.S. 
Chapter 11 reorganization statute, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s y Fitch Ratings withdrew their credit ratings for LATAM 
 3.3.  Estimates of fair value.  
 At December 31 , 2021,  the Company maintained financial instruments that should be recorded at 
fair value.  These are grouped into two categories:  
 
1. Derivative financial instruments:  
 
This category includes the following instruments:  
 
- Interest rate derivati ve contracts,  
 
- Fuel derivative contracts, 
 
- Currency derivative contracts.  
 
2. Financial Investments:  
 
This category includes the following instruments:  
 
- Investments in short -term Mutual Funds (cash equivalent)  
 
- Private investment funds.  
 49 
 
  The Company has  classified the fair value measurement using a hierarchy that reflects the level of 
information used in the assessment. This hierarchy consists of 3 levels (I) fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities , (II) fa ir value calculated through 
valuation methods based on i nputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)  and (III) fair value based on i nputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data.  
 The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets, such as investments acquired for 
trading, is based on quoted market prices at the close of the  period using the current price of the 
buyer. The fair value of financial assets not traded in active markets (derivative contracts) is 
determined using valuation techniques that maximize use of available market information. 
Valuation techniques generally used by the Company are quoted market prices of similar 
instruments and / or estimating the present value of future cash flows using forward price curves of 
the market at period end.  
 The following table shows the classification of financial instruments at  fair value, depending on the

 The book values of accounts receivable and payable are assumed to approximate their fair values, 
due to their short -term nature. In the case of cash on hand, bank balances, overnight, time deposits 
and accounts payable, non -current, fair value approximate s their carrying values.  
 
The fair value of other financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash 
flows at the current market interest rate for similar financial instruments (Level II). In the case of 
Other financial assets, t he valuation was performed according to market prices at period end.  The 
book value of Other financial liabilities, current or non -current, do not include lease liabilities.

 NOTE 4 - ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  
 
The Company has used estimates to value and record some of the assets, liabilities, income, 
expenses and commitments. Basically, these estimates refer to:  
 
(a) Evaluation of possible losses due to impairment of goodwill and intangible ass ets with 
indefinite useful life  
 
Management conducts an impairment test annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by 
which the carrying amount of the cas h generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount.  
 
Management’s value -in-use calculations included significant judgments and assumptions relating to 
revenue growth rates, exchange rate, discount rate, inflation rates, fuel price. The estimation of 
these assumptions requires significant judgment by the management, as these variables feature 
inherent uncertainty; however, the assumptions used are consistent with Company’s forecasts 
approved by management . Therefore, management evaluates and updates the estimates as 
necessary, in light of conditions that affect these variables. The main assumptions used as well as the corresponding sensitivity analyses are showed in Note 15.  
 
(b)  Useful life, residual value, and impairment of property, plant, and equipme nt 
 The depreciation of assets is calculated based on the linear model, except for certain technical 
components depreciated on cycles and hours flown. These useful lives are reviewed on an annual 
basis according with the Company’s future economic benefits associated with them.  
 
Changes in circumstances such as: technological advances, business model, planned use of assets or 
capital strategy may render the useful life different to the lifespan estimated. When it is determined 
that the useful life of proper ty, plant, and equipment must be reduced, as may occur in line with 
changes in planned usage of assets, the difference between the net book value and estimated recoverable value is depreciated, in accordance with the revised remaining useful life.  
 
The re sidua l values are estimated according to the market value that said assets will have at the end 
of their life. The residual value and useful life of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if necessary, once a year. When the value of an asset is greater than it s estimated recoverable amount, its value is 
immediately reduced to its recoverable amount.  
 The Company has concluded that the Properties, Plant and Equipment cannot generate cash inflows 
to a large extent independent of other assets, therefore the impair ment assessment is made as an 
integral part of the only Cash Generating Unit maintained by the Company, Air Transport. The Company checks when there are signs of impairment, whether the assets have suffered any impairment losses at the Cash Generated Unit level.  
 (c)  Recoverability of deferred tax assets   
 Management records deferred taxes on the temporary differences that arise between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets on tax losses 
are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future tax benefits will be available to offset temporary differences.  
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 20352 
 
 The Company applies significant judgment in evaluating the recoverability of deferred tax assets. 
In determining the amounts of the  deferred tax asset to be accounted for, management considers tax 
planning strategies historical profitability, projected future taxable income (considering assumptions such as: growth rate, exchange rate, discount rate, fuel price online with those used i n 
the impairment analysis of the group's cash -generating unit) and the expected timing of reversals of 
existing temporary differences.  
 
(d)  Air tickets sold that will not be finally used.  
 
The Company records the sale of air tickets as deferred income. Or dinary income from the sale of 
tickets is recognized in the income statement when the passenger transport service is provided or expired for non -use. The Company evaluates monthly the probability of expiration of air tickets, 
with return clauses, based on the history of use of air tickets. A change in this probability could 
generate an impact on revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years.  
 
In effect and due to the worldwide contingency of the COVID 19 pandemic, the company has 
estab lished new commercial policies with clients regarding the validity of air tickets, making it 
easier to use in flight, reissue and return, what has been considered at the time of estimating expired tickets . 
 
As of December 31, 2021, deferred income associa ted with air tickets sold amounted to                           
ThUS $ 1,126,371 (ThUS $ 904,558 as of December 31, 2020).  
 
(e)    Valuation of miles and points awarded to holders of loyalty programs, pending use.  
 As of December 31, 2021, the deferred inc ome associated with the LATAM Pass loyalty program 
amounts to ThUS $ 1,285,732 (ThUS $ 1,365,534 as of December 31, 20 20). A hypothetical 
change of one percentage point in the probability of swaps would translate into an impact of ThUS $ 27,151 in the resu lts as of 2021 (ThUS $ 24,425 in the results as of 2020). The deferred income 
associated with the LATAM Pass Brasil loyalty program (See Note 22) amounts to ThUS $ 192,381 as of December 31, 2021 (ThUS $ 187,493 as of December 31, 2020). A hypothetical 
change of two percentage points in exchange probability would translate into an impact of ThUS $ 
5,100 in the results as of 2021 (ThUS $ 4,948 in the results as of 2020).  
  
Management used statistical models to estimate the miles and point awarded that will n ot be 
redeemed, by the programs members (breakage) which involved significant judgments and 
assumptions relating the historical redemption and expiration activity and forecasted redemption 
and expiration patterns.  
 
The management in conjunction with an ext ernal specialist develop a predictive model of non -use 
miles or points, which allows to generate non -use rates on the basis of historical information, based 
on behavior of the accumulation, use and expiration of the miles or points.  
 
 (f)  Provisions needs , and their valuation when required  
 In the case of known contingencies, the Company records a provision when it has a present  
obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be requi red to settle the obligation and  a reliable estimate of the obligation amount 
can be made.  The assessment of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant 53 
 
 judgment and estimates of the outcome of future events, the likelihood of loss being incurred and 
when determining whether a reliable estimate of the loss can be made. The Company assesses its 
liabilities and contingencies based upon the best information available, uses the knowledge, 
experience and professional judgment to the specific ch aracteristics of the known risks. This 
process facilitates the early assessment and quantification of potential risks in individual cases or in 
the development of contingent matters. If we are unable to reliably estimate the obligation or 
conclude no loss is probable but it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred, no provision 
is recorded but the contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  
 Company recognized as the present obligation under an onerous contract as a provision when a 
contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.  
 (g)      Leases  
 
(i) Discount rate  
 The discount rate used to calculate the lease  debt corresponds, for each aircraft, to the implicit 
interest rate calculated by the contractual elements and residual market values. The implicit rate of 
the contract is the discount rate that gives the aggregate present value of the minimum lease 
paymen ts and the unguaranteed residual value.  
 For assets other than aircraft, the estimated lessee's incremental loan rate was used, which is 
derived from the information available on the lease commencement date, to determine the present 
value of the lease paym ents. We consider our recent debt issues, as well as publicly available data 
for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates.  
 A decrease of one percentage point in our estimate of the rates used as in the calc ulation of the new 
and amendment contract as of December 31, 2021 would increase the lease liability by approximately US $ 76 million.  
 
(ii) Lease term  
 In determining the term of the lease, all the facts and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive  to exercise an extension option are considered. Extension options (or periods after 
termination options) are only included in the term of the lease if you are reasonably certain that the 
lease will be extended (or not terminated). This is reviewed if a si gnificant event or significant 
change in circumstances occurs that affects this assessment and is within the control of the lessee.  
 
(h) Investment in subsidiary (TAM)  
 
The management has applied its judgment in determining that LATAM Airlines Group S.A. 
controls TAM S.A. and Subsidiaries, for accounting purposes, and has therefore consolidated the 
financial statements.  
 
The grounds for this decision are that LATAM issued ordinary shares in exchange for the majority 
of circulating ordinary and preferential shares in TAM, except for those TAM shareholders who did 
not accept the exchange, which were subject to a squeeze out, entitling LATAM to substantially all 
economic benefits generated by the LATAM Group, and thus exposing it to substantially all risks 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 20454 
 
 relating to the operations of TAM. This exchange aligns the economic interests of LATAM and all 
of its shareholders, including the controlling shareholders of TAM, thus ensuring that the 
shareholders and directors of TAM shall have no incentive to exercise the ir rights in a manner that 
would be beneficial to TAM but detrimental to LATAM. Furthermore, all significant actions 
necessary of the operation of the airlines require votes in favor by the controlling shareholders of 
both LATAM and TAM.  
 Since the integra tion of LAN and TAM operations, the most critical airline operations in Brazil 
have been managed by the CEO of TAM while global activities have been managed by the CEO of 
LATAM, who is in charge of the operation of the LATAM Group as a whole and reports to  the 
LATAM Board.  
 
The CEO of LATAM also evaluates the performance of LATAM Group executives and, together 
with the LATAM Board, determines compensation. Although Brazilian law currently imposes restrictions on the percentages of voting rights that may be  held by foreign investors, LATAM 
believes that the economic basis of these agreements meets the requirements of accounting standards in force, and that the consolidation of the operations of LAN and LATAM is appropriate.  
 These estimates were made based on the best information available relating to the matters analyzed.  
 
In any case, it is possible that events that may take place in the future could lead to their 
modification in future reporting periods, which would be made in a prospective manner.

 NOT E 5 - SEGMENTAL INFORMATION  
 
As of December 31, 202 1, the Company considers that it has a single operating segment, Air 
Transport. This segment corresponds to the route network for air transport and is based on the wa y 
in which the business is managed, according to the centralized nature of its operations, the ability to open and close routes, as well as reassignment (airplanes, crew, personnel, etc.) within the network, 
which implies a functional interrelation between  all of them, making them inseparable.  This 
segment definition is one of the most common in the worldwide airline industry.

The Company allocates revenues by geographic area based on the point of sale of the passenger ticket or cargo. Assets are composed  primarily of aircraft and aeronautical equipment, which are 
used throughout the different countries, so it is not possible to assign a geographic area.  
The Company has no customers that individually represent more than 10% of sales.

Once pre -judicial and judicial collection efforts are exhausted, the assets are written off against the 
allowance. The Company  only uses the allowance method rather than direct write -off, to ensure 
control.  
The historical and current renegotiations are not very relevant, and the policy is to analyze case by 
case to classify them according to the existence of risk, determining if their reclassification 
corresponds to pre -judicial collection accounts.  
 
The maximum credit -risk exposure at the date of presentation of the information is the fair value of 
each one of the categories of accounts receivable indicated above.

(2) Aircraft maintenance reserves reflect prepayment deposits made by the group to lessors of 
certain aircraft under operating lease agreements in order to ensure that funds are available to support the scheduled heavy maintenance of the aircraft.  
 
These deposits are calculated based on the operation, measured in cycles or flight hou rs, are paid 
periodically, and it is contractually stipulated that they be returned to the Company each time major maintenance is carried out. At the end of the lease, the unused maintenance reserves are returned to 
the Company or used to compensate the le ssor for any debt related to the maintenance conditions of 
the aircraft.  
 In some cases, (2 lease agreements), if the maintenance cost incurred by LATAM is less than the 
corresponding maintenance reserves, the lessor is entitled to retain those excess amou nts at the time 
the heavy maintenance is performed. The Company periodically reviews its maintenance reserves for each of its leased aircraft to ensure that they will be recovered and recognizes an expense if any 
such amounts are less than probable of bein g returned. The cost of aircraft maintenance in the last 
years has been higher than the related maintenance reserves for all aircraft.  
 As of December 31, 2021, the company does not maintain maintenance reserves, these were 
exercised by the lessors for the  non-payment of rent as a result of the chapter 11 process (ThUS$ 
8,613 as of December 31, 2020) . 
 Aircraft maintenance reserves are classified as current or non -current depending on the dates when 
the related maintenance is expected to be performed (Note 2.23).

The balances are presented at the lower of book value and fair value less cost to sell.  The fair value 
of these assets was determined based on quoted prices in active markets for  similar assets or 
liabilities. This is a level II measurement as per the fair value hierarchy set out in Note 3.3 (2). There were no transfers between levels for recurring fair value measurements during the year.  
Assets r eclassified from Property, plant a nd equipment to Non -current assets or groups of assets for 
disposal classified as held for sale.  
During the year 2020, the sale of a Boeing 767 aircraft took place and therefore US $ 5.5 million 
was recognized as profit from the transaction.  
 Additionally,  during the year 2020, Delta Air Lines, Inc. canceled the purchase of four Airbus A350 
aircraft, given this, LATAM was compensated with the payment of ThUS $ 62,000, which was 
recorded in the income statement as other income. These four aircraft were recla ssified to Property, 
plant and equipment.  
 
During 2020, eleven Boeing 767 aircraft were transferred from the Property, plant and equipment 
item, to the Non -current assets item or groups of assets for disposal classified as held for sale. 
During 2021, the s ale of five aircraft were completed.  
 During the third quarter of the year 2021, associated with the fleet restructuring plan, they were 
transferred from the Property, plant and equipment component of spare parts and engines to the 
Non-current assets or gr oups of assets for disposal classified as held for sale. During the fourth 
quarter of 2021, according to the Chapter 11 Procedure, an engine of the XWB family included in 
this group of assets was rejected, due to finally not complete the sales.  
 Additional ly, a loss was recognized for US$85 million during the year (US$ 332 million at 
December 31, 2020) to adjust the assets to its fair value less the cost of sales, which were recorded 
in the income statement as part of the restructuring activities expenses.

(1) In 2016, the Company resolved to adopt a unique name and identity, and announced that the 
group's brand will be LATAM, which united all the companies under a single image.  
The estimate of the new useful life is 5 years, equivalent to the period necessary to complete the 
change of image.  
At December 31, 2021 TAM's trademark is fully amortized  
(2) See Note 2.5  
(3) In 2020, a digital transformation was imp lemented (LATAM XP), as a result some projects 
became obsolete and were fully amortized. 
For further detail on impairment test see Note 16.  71 
 
 The amortization of each period is recognized in the consolidated income statement in the 
administrative expenses. T he cumulative amortization of computer programs, brands and other 
assets as of December 31, 2021, amounts to ThUS $ 366,053 (ThUS $ 424,932 as of December 31, 
2020).  
b) Impairment Test Intangible Assets with an indefinite useful life  
 
As of December 31, 20 21, the Company maintains only the CGU “Air Transport”.  
 
The CGU “Air transport” considers the transport of passengers and cargo, both in the domestic markets of Chile, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil, as well as in a series of regional and i nternational routes in America, Europe, Africa and Oceania.  
 
 
As of December 31, 2021, in accordance with the accounting policy, the Company performed the 
annual impairment test.  
The recoverable amount of the CGU was determined based on calculations of the  value in use. 
These calculations use projections of 5 years cash flows after taxes from the financial budgets 
approved by the Administration. Cash flows beyond the budgeted period are extrapolated using 
growth rates and estimated average volumes, which do  not exceed long -term average growth rates.  
 Management’s cash flow projections included significant judgements and assumptions related to annual revenue growth rates, discount rate, inflation rates, the exchange rate and price of fuel. The 
annual revenue growth rate is based on past performance and management’s expectations of market 
development in each of the countries in which it operates. The discount rates used, for the CGU "Air transport", are in determined in US dollars, after taxes, and reflect spec ific risks related to the 
relevant countries of each of the operations. Inflation rates and exchange rates are based on the data 
available from the countries and the information provided by the Central Banks of the various 
countries where it operates, and the price of fuel is determined based on estimated levels of 
production, the competitive environment of the market in which they operate and their commercial 
strategy.  
 
The recoverable values were determined using the following assumptions:  
 
 
                                            CGU  
                                            Air transport

                                                   (1) In line with expectations of the Central Bank of Brazil.  
              
         The result of the impairment test, which includes a sensitivity analysis of its main variables, showed 
that the calculated recover able values exceed the book value of the cash -generating unit, and 
therefore no impairment was detected.  
 
Integrated Report 2021

 The CGU is sensitive to annual growth rates, discounts and exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis 
included the individual impact of changes in cri tical estimates in determining recoverable amounts, 
namely:  
 
                Increase  
  Decrease rate

 NOTE 18 - CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES  
 
In the year ended December 31, 202 1, the income tax provision was  calculated for such period, 
applying the partially semi -integrated taxation system and a rate of 27%, in accordance with the 
Law No. 21,210, which modernizes the Tax Legislation, published in the Journal of the Republic of Chile, dated February 24, 2020.  
The net result for deferred tax corresponds to the variation of the year, of the assets and liabilities 
for deferred taxes generated by temporary differences and tax losses.  
For the permanent differences that give rise to a book value of assets and liabili ties other than their 
tax value, no deferred tax has been recorded since they are caused by transactions that are recorded 
in the financial statements and that will have no effect on spending tax for income tax.

Unrecognized deferred tax assets:  
 
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the corresp onding tax benefit 
will be realized in the future. In total the company has not recognized deferred tax assets for ThUS$ 
2,638,473 (ThUS$ 749,100  as of December 31, 20 20) which include deferred tax assets related to 
negative tax results of ThUS $ 9,030,059 (ThUS$ 1,433,474  at December 31, 20 20). 
 (*) As stated in note 2c), on November 26th, 2021 the Company filed a Reorganization Plan and 
Disclosure Statement in which, among other ítems, financial forecasts are included together with 
the proposed issuance of  new shares and convertible bonds. With the referred information, the 
Company management updated its analysis on the recoverability of deferred tax assets and 
determined that during the time covered by the financial forecast it will not be probable that pa rt of 
such deferred tax assets may offset future taxable profits. Therefore, the Company during the fourth 
quarter of 2021 derecognized deferred tax assets not considered recoverable in the amount of 
THUS$1,251,912.

 (1)  During March and April 2020, LAT AM Airlines Group S.A. it drew down the entire     
(US$ 600 million) of the committed credit line “Revolving Credit Facility (RCF)”. The financing 
expires on March 29, 2022. The line is guaranteed with collateral consisting of airplanes, engines 
and spare parts.  
 
(2)  On May 26, 2020, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and its subsidiaries in Chile, Peru, 
Colombia and Ecuador availed themselves, in court for the southern district of New York, to the protection of Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law of the United State s. Under Section 362 of the 
Bankruptcy Code. The same happened for TAM LINHAS AÉREAS S.A and certain subsidiaries 
(all LATAM subsidiary in Brazil), on July 9, 2020. Having filed for Chapter 11 automatically 
suspends most actions against LATAM and its subsi diaries, including most actions to collect 
financial obligations incurred before the date of receipt of Chapter 11 or to exercise control over the 
property of LATAM and its subsidiaries. Consequently, although the bankruptcy filing may have 
led to breaches  of some of the obligations of LATAM and its subsidiaries, the counterparties cannot 
take any action as a result of said breaches.  
 At the end of the period, Chapter 11 retains most of the actions on the debtors so the repayment of 
the debt is not accelera ted. The Group continues to present its financial information as of September 
30, 2021, including its interest bearing loan and leases, in accordance with the originally agreed 
conditions, pending future agreements that it may reach with its creditors unde r Chapter 11. For 
those agreements that have already been modified or extinguished, the financial information has been properly presented according to the new contracts' terms and conditions.  
(3)  On June 24, 2020, the United States Court for the Southern District of New York approved 
the motion filed by the Company to reject certain aircraft lease contracts. Rejected contracts 
include, 17 aircraft financed under the EETC structure with an amount of ThUS$ 844.1 and an 
aircraft financed with a financial leas e with an amount of ThUS$ 4.5.  
 
(4)  On October 20, 2020, the United States Court for the Southern District of New York 
approved the motion presented by the Company to reject an aircraft lease contract financed as financial lease in the amount of ThUS$ 34. 3. 
 
(5)        On September 29, 2020, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. entered into a ThUS$ 2,450 Debtor -
in-Possession financing (the “DIP Financing”), consisting of a ThUS$ 1,300 Tranche A Facility and

(1) Hedge the significant variations in cash flows associated with market risk implicit in the increases  in the 3 months LIBOR interest rates for long -term loans incurred in the acquisition 
of aircraft and bank loans. These contracts are recorded as cash flow hedges.  
 
(2) Hedge significant variations in cash flows associated with market risk implicit in the cha nges 
in the price of future fuel purchases. These contracts are recorded as cash flow hedges.  
 
The Company only has cash flow and fair value hedges (in the case of CCS). In the case of fuel hedges, the cash flows subject to such hedges will occur and will impact results in the next 12 
months from the date of the consolidated statement of financial position, while in the case of hedges of interest rates, these they will occur and will impact results throughout the life of the 
associated loans, up to their ma turity. In the case of currency hedges through a CCS, there is a 
group of hedging relationships, in which two types of hedge accounting are generated, one of cash 
flow for the US $ / UF component; and another of fair value, for the floating rate component US $. 
The other group of hedging relationships only generates cash flow hedge accounting for the US $ / UF component.

 All hedging operations have been performed for highly probable transactions, except for fuel hedge. 
See Note 3.  
 Since none of the hedges resulted in the recognition of a non -financial asset, no portion of the result 
of derivatives recognized in equity was transferred to the initial value of that type of asset.

(1) Accumulated balances include a judicial deposit delivered in guarantee, with respect to the 
“Fundo Aeroviario” (FA), for M US$ 6 5, made in order to suspend the collection and the 
application of a fine. The Company is discussing in Court the constitutionality  of the 
requirement made by FA calculated at the ratio of 2.5% on the payroll in a legal claim. 
Initially the payment of said contribution was suspended by a preliminary judicial decision and 
about 10 years later, this same decision was reversed. As the de cision is not final, the 
Company has deposited the securities open until that date, in order to avoid collection processing and the application of the fine.  
 Finally, if the final decision is favorable to the Company, the deposit made and payments made la ter will return to TAM. On the other hand, if the court confirms the first decision, said 
deposit will become a final payment in favor of the Government of Brazil. The procedural stage as of December 31 , 2021  is described in Note 31 in the Role of the case  
2001.51.01.012530 -0.

(*) Lease expenses are included within this amount (See Note 2.21)  
(**) During 2021 , the Company amended its Aircraft Lease Contracts which included lease 
payment based on Power by the Hour (PBH) at the beginning of the contract and then switches to 
fixed -rent payments. A right of use asset and a lease liability was recognized as result of those 
amendments at the date of modification of the contract, even if they initially have a variable 
payment period. As a result of the application of the lease accounting policy, the right of use assets 
continues to be amortized on a straight -line basi s over the term of the lease from the contract 
modification date. The expenses for the year include both: the lease expense for variable payments (Aircraft Rentals) as well as the expenses resulting from the amortization of the right of use assets from the  beginning of the contract (included in the Depreciation line  b) below ) and interest from the 
lease liability (included in Lease Liabilities  c) below ).

This is a voidance action appealing the charges for 
violations and fines (67.168.795 / 67.168.833 / 
67.168.884 / 67.168.906 / 67.168.914 / 67.168.965).  We 
are arguing that numbers are missing from the ISS 
calculation base since the company supposedly made 
improper deductions.   
The lawsuit was assigned on January 31, 2018.  That same day, a 
decision was rendered suspending the charges without any bond. 
The municipality filed an appeal against this decision on April 30, 
2018. On November 11, 2019 there was a totally favorable 
decision for Tam Viagens S.A. The court issued a ruling in favor 
of Tam Viagens S/A on June 24, 2021.  An appeal by the 
Municipality is pending.

 Case No. 20 -11254  
 LATAM Airlines initiated a reorganization proceeding in 
the United States of America in accordance with the 
regulations established in Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the 
Code of the United States of America, filing a voluntary 
request for rel ief pursuant thereto (the “Chapter 11 
Proceeding”), which grants an automatic stay of 
enforcement for at least 180 days.  
 On May 26, 2020, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. and 28 
subsidiaries (the “Initial Debtors”) individually filed a voluntary 
petition for reo rganization  with the United States Bankruptcy 
Court for the Southern District of New York pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Subsequently, on July 7 and 9, 2020, 9 additional affiliated debtors (the "Subsequent 
Debtors" and togeth er with the Initial Debtors, the “Subsequent 
Debtors”), including TAM Linhas Aereas S.A., filed voluntary 
bankruptcy applications with the Court pursuant to Chapter 11 of 
the United States Bankruptcy Code. The cases are pending 
resolution before the Honora ble James L. Garrity Jr. in United 
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District Court of New 
York (the “Bankruptcy Court”) and are being jointly administered 
under case number 20 -11254. On September 18, 2020, the Debtors 
received approval of the modif ied funding proposal for Debtor in 
Possession (“DIP”) funding filed on September 17, 2020 from the Bankruptcy Court.  On October 18, 2021 the Bankruptcy Court approved the Debtors’ request for certain additional DIP funding, 
namely a “Tranche B” facility.  On November 26, 2021, the 
Debtors filed a joint plan of reorganization together with a disclosure statement.  A hearing will be conducted on January 27, 
2022 to rule on the adequacy of the disclosure statement.  The 
Bankruptcy Court has extended the Debto rs’ exclusive period to 
solicit acceptances for the plan to January 26, 2022.  The 
Subsequent Debtors have sought an additional extension of their exclusive periods to file and solicit acceptances for the plan, until 
January 7, 2022 and March 7, 2022 respe ctively.  A hearing on 
that request will be conducted on January 27, 2022. LATAM has 
continued its process of reconciling claims and presenting 
objections. Likewise, LATAM continues to evaluate its contracts 
and has rejected some of them. It continues with  the review of its 
existing fleet obligations, and pursuing solicitation and 
confirmation of its plan.

Investigation of alleged infringements to free 
competition of cargo airlines, especially fuel 
surcharge. On December 26th, 2007, the General 
Directora te for Competition of the European 
Commission notified Lan Cargo S.A. and 
LATAM Airlines Group S.A. the instruction 
process against twenty five cargo airlines, 
including Lan Cargo S.A., for alleged breaches of 
competition in the air cargo market in Europe,  
especially the alleged fixed fuel surcharge and 
freight.   
On April 14th, 2008, the notification of the European Commission was replied.                       The appeal was filed on               Januar y 
24, 2011.  
On May 11, 2015, we attended a hearing a t which we petitioned for 
the vacation of the Decision based on discrepancies in the Decision 
between the operating section, which mentions four infringements 
(depending on the routes involved) but refers to Lan in only one of those four routes; and the ru ling section (which mentions one single 
conjoint infraction).  
On November 9th, 2010, the General Directorate for Competition of the European Commission notified Lan Cargo S.A. and LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. the imposition of a fine in the amount of 
THUS$9, 299 (8.220.000 Euros)  
This fine is being appealed by Lan Cargo S.A. and LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A.  On December 16, 2015, the European Court 
of Justice revoked the Commission’s decision because of 
discrepancies. The European Commission did not appeal the 
decision, but presented a new one on March 17, 2017 reiterating the 
imposition of the same fine on the eleven original airlines.  The fine 
totals 776,465,000 Euros.  It imposed the same fine as before on 
Lan Cargo and its parent, LATAM Airlines Group S.A., t otaling 
8.2 million Euros. On May 31, 2017 Lan Cargo S.A. and LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. filed a petition with the General Court of the 
European Union seeking vacation of this decision. We presented 
our defense in December 2017. On July 12, 2019, we attende d a 
hearing before the European Court of Justice to confirm our 
petition for vacation of judgment or otherwise, a reduction in the 
amount of the fine.  LATAM AIRLINES GROUP, S.A. expects that the ruling by the General Court of the European Union, which 
is expected to be known at the end of March 2022, may reduce the 
amount of this fine. On December 17, 2020, the European 
Commission submitted proof of claim for the total amount of the fine (ThUS$9.299 (€8,220,000)) to the New York Court hearing 
the Chapter 1 1 procedure petitioned by LATAM Airlines Group, 
S.A. and LAN Cargo, S.A. in May 2020.

  Lawsuits filed against European airlines by users of 
freight se rvices in private lawsuits as a result of the 
investigation into alleged breaches of competition of cargo airlines, especially fuel surcharge. Lan Cargo S.A. and LATAM Airlines Group S.A., have been 
sued in court proceedings directly and/or in third 
party,  based in England, Norway, the Netherlands 
and Germany.  In the case in England, mediation was held with nearly all the airlines 
involved in the aim of attempting to reach an agreement. It began in 
September 2018, and LATAM Airlines Group S.A. reached an 
agreement for approximately GBP 636,000.  A settlement was signed in 
December 2018 and payment was made in January 2019.  This lawsuit 
ended for all plaintiffs in the class action, except for one who signed a 
settlement for approximately GBP 222,469.63 in De cember 2019.  The 
payment was made in January 2020 and concluded the entire lawsuit in 
England. For the case in Germany, LATAM petitioned the German 
Court for a suspension on the basis of the financial reorganization 
petitioned by LATAM Airlines Group S.A.  and Lan Cargo S.A. in the 
United States (Chapter 11) in May 2020.  DB Barnsdale AG also filed a claim with the U.S. Court by the deadline that creditors have under Chapter 11 claims.  An agreement was reached with Barnsdale AG 
before the Courts could rule  
and that ended all claims in Germany.  
British Airways; KLM; Martinair; Air France; Lufthansa; Lufthansa 
Cargo and Swiss Air filed claims with the U.S. Court.  LATAM 
opposed these claims and the U.S.  Court dismissed and voided them 
after a review on May 27, 2021.  The two proceedings still pending in 
Norway and the Netherlands are in the evidentiary stages.  There has 
been no activity in Norway since January 2014 and in the Netherlands, 
since February 2021.  The amounts are indeterminate.  -0-

 Colombia. This case is being heard by the 45th Civil Court of the Bogota Circuit in Colombia.  Statements were taken 
from witnesses presented by REGIONAL ONE and VAS on February 12, 2018.  The court received the expert 
opinions requested by REGIONAL ONE and VAS and given their petition, it asked the experts to expand upon their opinions. It also changed the experts requeste d by LATAM AIRLINES COLOMBIA. The case was brought before 
the Court on September 10, 2018 and these rulings are pending processing so that a new hearing can be scheduled. On October 31, 2018, the judge postponed the deadline for the parties to answer the o bjection because of a serious error 
brought to light by VAS regarding the translation submitted by the expert. The process has been in the judge’s 
chambers since March 11, 2019 to decide on replacing the damage estimation expert as requested by LATAM 
AIRLI NES COLOMBIA.  The one previously appointed did not take office.  A petition has also been made by VAS 
objecting to the translation of the documents in English into Spanish due to serious mistakes, which was served to the 
parties in October 2018. The 45th Civil Circuit Court issued an order on August 13, 2019 that did not decide on the 
pending matters but rather voided all actions since September 14, 2018 and ordered the case to be referred to the 46th 
Civil Circuit Court according to article 121 of the Gen eral Code of Procedure.  Said article says that court decisions 
must be rendered in no more than one (1) year as from the service of the court order admitting the claim.  If that period expires without any ruling being issued, the Judge will automatically forfeit competence over the proceedings 
and must give the Administrative Room of the Superior Council of the Judiciary notice of that fact the next day, in 
addition to referring the case file to the next sitting judge in line, who will have competence and will issue a ruling in 
no more than 6 months.  The case was sent to the 46th Civil Circuit Court on September 4, 2019, which claims that 
there was a competence conflict and then sent the case to the Superior Court of Bogotá to decide which court, the 45th 
or 46th, had to continue with the case.  The Court decided that 45
th Civil Circuit Court should continue with the case, 
so this Court on 01/15/2020 has reactivated the procedural process ordering the transfer to the parties of the objection presented by VAS  for serious error of the translation to Spanish of documents provided in English. On 02/24/2020 it 
declares that the parties did not rule on the objection presented by VAS and requires the plaintiff to submit an expert 
opinion of damages corresponding to the claims of the lawsuit through its channel. Since 03/16/20 a suspension of 
terms is filed in Courts due to the pandemic.  Judicial terms were reactivated on July 1, 2020. On September 18, 2020, 
an expert opinion on damages was submitted that had been req uested by the Court. The Court ordered service of the 
ruling to the parties on December 14, 2020. The defendants, REGIONAL ONE and VAS, filed a motion for 
reconsideration of this decision, petitioning that the evidence of the expert opinion be eliminated b ecause it was 
presented late.  The motion was denied by the Court.  On April 30, 2021, they petitioned for a clarification and 
supplement to the opinion, to which the Court agreed in a decision on May 19, 2021, giving the expert 10 business 
days to respond .  The brief of clarification was filed June 2, 2021 and the docket was presented to the Judge on June 
3, 2021.  The parties were given notice of the objection on July 21, 2021 based on a serious mistake in the opinion 
presented by Regional One.  The case e ntered the judgment phase on August 5, 2021.  On October 7, 2021, the Court 
set a date for the instruction and judgment hearing, which will be February 3, 2022.  Regional One, the defendant, 
filed a petition for reconsideration on October 13, 2021 that had not been decided on the date of this report.  The 
claim was withdrawn on January 11, 2022 because the matter had been settled before the Bankruptcy Court hearing 
the Chapter 11 claim.  The Court decreed the end of the proceedings because the claims were wi thdrawn in a ruling 
issued January 19, 2022.  
 
Florida. On June 4, 2019, the State Court of Florida allowed REGIONAL ONE to add a new claim against LATAM 
AIRLINES COLOMBIA for default on a verbal contract.  Given the new claim, LATAM AIRLINES COLOMBIA petitioned that the Court postpone the trial to August 2019 to have the time to investigate the facts alleged by 
REGIONAL ONE to prove a verbal contract. The facts discovery phase continued, including the verbal statements of the experts of both sides, which ha ve been taking place since March 2020. Given the Covid -19 pandemic and the 
suspension of trials in the County of Miami -Dade, the Court canceled the trial scheduled for June 2020. In addition, 
the claims against Aires have been suspended given the request f or reorganization filed by LATAM AIRLINES 
GROUP SA and some of its subsidiaries, including Aires, on May 26, 2020, under Chapter 11 of the United States 
Bankruptcy Code. Dash and Regional One filed unsecured claims with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court by the dea dline that 
creditors have according to Chapter 11. On October 18, 2021, the parties participated in a third mediation where they 
agreed on the terms of a global settlement. On December 16, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of 
New York ap proved the global agreement and release.  Therefore, Dash and Regional withdrew their claims against 
Aires in Florida on December 21, 2021, which put an end to the proceedings.  9,500

seeking vacation of this judgment by the Court was  filed on September 
5th and we are awaiting a decision by the Appellate judges. As of 
December 31, 2018, the attorneys believed that the probability of 
recovering this sum had fallen to 30% -40% because of the pressure 
being put by the Executive Branch on t he National Court of Justice and 
the Judiciary in general for rulings not to affect government revenues and because the case involves differences that are based on insufficient 
documentation supporting the expense. Given the percentage loss (above 50%), th e accounting write -off of this recovery has been carried

 C-8498 -2020 Origin  
 
 
 Class Action Lawsuit filed by the National Corporation of 
Consumers and Users (CONADECUS) against LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. for alleged breaches of the Law on Protection of Consumer Rights due to flight cancellations 
caused by the COVID -19 Pandemic, requesting the nullity 
of possible abusive clauses, the imposition of fines and 
compensation for damages in defense of the collective 
interest of consumers. LATAM has hired specialist 
lawyers to undertake its defense.  Stage of  trial 
 
 
 On 06/25/2020 we were notified of the lawsuit. On 04/07/2020 we filed 
a motion for reversal against the ruling that declared the action filed by 
CONADECUS admissible, the decision is pending to date. On 
07/11/2020 we requested the Court to comply  with the suspension of 
this case, ruled by the 2nd Civil Court of Santiago, in recognition of the 
foreign reorganization procedure pursuant to Law No. 20,720, for the entire period that said proceeding lasts, a request that was accepted by 
the Court. CONA DECUS filed a remedy of reconsideration and an 
appeal against this resolution should the remedy of reconsideration be 
dismissed.  The Court dismissed the reconsideration on August 3, 2020, 
but admitted the appeal.  The appeal is currently pending before th e 
Santiago Court of Appeals. The amount at the moment is 
undetermined.  
 
New York Case. Parallel to the lawsuit in Chile, on August 31, 2020, CONADECUS filed on appeal with U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the 
Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”)  because of 
the automatic suspension imposed by Section 362 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code that, among other things, prohibits the parties from filing or continuing with claims that involve a preliminary petition 
against the Borrowers.  CONADECUS petitioned ( i) for a stay of the 
automatic suspension to the extent necessary to continue with the class 
action against LATAM in Chile and (ii) for a joint hearing by the 
Bankruptcy Court and the Second Civil Court of Santiago in Chile (the “Chile Insolvency Court”) t o hear the matters relating to the claims of 
CONADECUS in Chile. On December 18, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court 
sustained part of CONADECUS’s petition, but only to allow it to continue its appeal against the decision by the 23rd Civil Court of 
Santiago and sol ely so that the Court of Appeals can decide whether or 
not a stay is admissible under Chilean insolvency law.  On December 
31, 2020, CONADECUS petitioned to continue with its appeal against 
the decision by the 25th Civil Court that approved the reconciliat ion 
between AGRECU and LATAM. On February 9, 2021, the Bankruptcy 
Court sustained just one of the petitions of CONADECUS.  As a result, 
they can continue their appeal against the decision by the 25th Civil 
Court that approved the reconciliation of AGRECU a nd LATAM.  Amounts

NOTE 32 - COMMITMENTS  
 
(a)  Commitments for loans obtai ned 
 
In relation to certain contracts committed by the Company for the financing of the Boeing 777 
aircraft, which are guaranteed by Export – Import Bank of the United States of America, 
commencing on January 1, 2023, limits have been established for some financial indicators of 
LATAM Airlines Group S.A. on a consolidated basis. Under any circumstance, non -compliance of 
this limits, does not generate credit acceleration.  
 The Company and its subsidiaries do not have credit agreements that indicate limits to  some 
financial indicators of the Company or the subsidiaries, with the exception of those detailed below:  
 
Regarding the revolving committed credit line (“Revolving Credit Facility”) established with a consortium of twelve banks led by Citibank, with a gu arantee of aircraft, engines, spare parts and 
supplies for a total committed amount of US $ 600 million, it includes restrictions of minimum liquidity, measured at the Consolidated Company level (with a minimum level of US $ 750 million) 
and individually m easured for LATAM Airlines Group S.A. companies and TAM Linhas Aéreas 
S.A. (with a minimum level of US $ 400 million). Compliance with these restrictions is a 
prerequisite for using the line; if the line is used, said restrictions must be reported quarterl y, and 
non-compliance with these restrictions will accelerate credit. As of December 31, 2021, this line of 
credit is fully used.  
 As of Dec ember 3 1, 2021, the Company is in compliance with all the financial indicators detailed 
above.  
 On the other hand, t he financing agreements of the Company generally establish clauses regarding 
changes in the ownership structure and in the controller and disposition of assets (which mainly 
refers to significant transfers of assets).  
 
Under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy C ode, the filing of voluntary bankruptcy petitions by the 
Debtors automatically stayed most actions against the Debtors, including most actions to collect 
indebtedness incurred prior to the Petition Date or to exercise control over the Debtors’ property.  
 Accordingly, counterparties are stayed from taking any actions as a result of such purported 
defaults. Specifically, the financing agreements of the Company generally establish that the filing of bankruptcy or similar proceedings constitute an event of def ault, which are unenforceable under the 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 258133 
 
 Bankruptcy Code. At the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company has not 
received notices of termination of financing arrangements, based on such an event of default.  
 On September 29, 2020 the  company signed the so -called "DIP Financing", which contemplates 
minimum liquidity restrictions of at least US $ 400 million at a consolidated level.  
 LATAM's obligations to the lenders of the DIP Financing have a super administrative preference

 LATAM's sustainability strategy launched in 2021 is based on 4 action fronts: Environmental 
Management System, Climate Change, Circular Econo my and Shared Value, and from these, it

level and under the same structure, this, it seeks to certify its operation under stage II of the IATA 
Environmental Assessment Program (IEnvA), which is designed to evaluate and improve, 
independently, the environmental management of airlines,  given that in addition to being based on 
the ISO 14001 standard, it involves the best practices of the industry.  
 Climate Change Management  
 To manage its carbon footprint and contribute to the protection of strategic ecosystems in the region, LATAM has s et a goal to offset 50% of domestic emissions by 2030 and be carbon -neutral 
by 2050, for this it has focused your strategy in:  
 
Efficient operation: with the implementation of LATAM Fuel Efficiency, a corporate program for 
the efficient use of fuel that co nsiders initiatives in all areas of the company that have an impact on 
fuel consumption.  
 
Sustainable Alternative Fuels (SAF): Given the importance of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to 
combat climate change in the long term, LATAM is developing a work pla n focused on Brazil, 
which has recognized and long -standing experience in biofuels; and Chile, a country with high 
development potential in green hydrogen. 
 Emission compensation: LATAM has assumed a total commitment to the environment and has 
established different alliances that will allow it not only to acquire carbon credits for its 
compensation needs but also to contribute to the conservation of strategic ecosystems in the region.  
 
Circular Economy  
 
LATAM aims to eliminate single -use plastics before 202 3 and be a zero waste to landfill group by 
2027. To achieve these goals, it has reviewed its waste management to promote the circular 
economy within its processes, acting from materiality.  
 
Shared Value  
 In creating shared value, the Solidarity Plane progr am stands out, created in 2011 and with which 
LATAM makes its structure, connectivity, and passenger and cargo transport capacity available to society for free in South America. The program acts in three areas of action: it supports health 
needs, promotes the conservation of natural resources, and provides support in the event of natural 
disasters.

Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 295
RationaleComparative analysis and explanation 
of main trends:
1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENT
At December 31, 2021, the company’s 
assets totaled ThUS$13,312,434 
which, compared to December 31, 
2020, represents a decrease of 
ThUS$2,337,656 (14.9%). 
The company’s-current assets 
decreased by ThUS$508,408 (16.2%) 
vs. yearend 2020. The main decreases 
were seen in the following line 
items: Cash and cash equivalents for 
ThUS$649,006 (38.3%). This decrease 
is explained by the net negative 
change presented in the Company’s 
consolidated statement of flows; 
inventories, current for ThUS$36,237 
(11.2%), mainly associated with an 
increase in material consumption; Non-
current assets or groups of assets held 
for disposal classified as held for sale 
for ThUS$129,339 (46.8%) originated 
mainly by the materialization of the 
sale of 5 aircraft (US$103 million) 
and the adjustment to the net 
realizable value of aircraft classified 
in this heading, offset by an increase 
in Commercial debtors and other 
receivables for ThUS$303,291 (50.6%), 
mainly explained by an increase in 
credit card sales.The company’s liquidity index showed 
a decrease going from 0.42 times at 
yearend 2020 to 0.21 times at the 
end of December 2021, mainly due to 
a 64.7% increase in current Liabilities. 
Moreover, we can see that the quick 
ratio decreased from 0.23 times at 
yearend 2020 to 0.08 times at the end 
of December 2021. 
The company’s Non-current assets 
decreased by ThUS$1,829,248 (14.6%) 
vs. yearend 2020. The main line items 
of non-current assets with decreases 
are: Property, plant, and equipment 
for ThUS$1,240,402 (11.6%), whose 
negative variation is mainly explained 
by the depreciation in the year by 
ThUS$982,995, renegotiations of 
assets by right of use associated with 
109 aircraft for approximately US$180 
million, the rejection of fleet due to the 
Chapter 11 process for ThUS$1,094,318, 
exchange difference worth 
ThUS$40,752, and other movements 
worth ThUS$143,816, offset by year 
additions worth ThUS$1,201.479; 
decrease of Intangible assets other 
than goodwill by ThUS$27,667 (2.6%), 
mainly due to exchange adjustments 
for ThUS$58,734, a decrease of 
ThUS$51,162 corresponding to the 
amortization of the year, offset by 
an increase from additions worth 
ThUS$82,798; decrease of deferred tax assets by ThUS$549,526 (97 .3%), 
generated mainly by provisions 
for deferred tax assets estimated 
to be non-recoverable worth 
ThUS$1,251,912, offset by recognition 
of deferred tax by operation 2021 for 
ThUS$702,386.
At December 31, 2021, the company’s 
liabilities totaled ThUS$20,379,338 
which, compared to the value as 
at December 31, 2020, represents 
an increase of ThUS$2,286,863 
(equivalent to 12.6%). 
The company’s Non-current assets 
increased by ThUS$4,844,441 (64.7%) vs. 
yearend 2020. The main increases were 
seen in: Other financial liabilities, current 
for ThUS$1,397,721 (45.7%), which 
are mainly explained by the increase 
from obtaining new loans associated 
with the second draft under DIP Credit 
Contract for ThUS$661,042 and others 
for ThUS$567, the increase in interest 
earned worth ThUS$504,599, and 
movements for fleet renegotiations and 
other reclassifications from the non-
current line item worth ThUS$1,090,885, 
offset by capital and interest payments 
made in the period for ThUS$671,035, 
debt losses due to fleet rejections, 
ThUS$188,337; Commercial and 
other accounts payable, current for 
ThUS$2,538.028 (109.3%), mainly 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 296explained by agreed claims of rejected 
aircraft and increased maintenance 
provisions; Accounts payable to related 
entities, current for ThUS$660,790, 
explained by the transfer of non-
current position to current position 
on DIP financing for ThUS$396,423 
plus interest earned for ThUS$35,030, 
obtaining financing for ThUS$130,102 
associated with the second draft 
under DIP Credit Contract, and accrued 
interest and other movements for 
ThUS$99,235; Other non-financial 
liabilities, current for ThUS$243,785 
(11.7%), explained by increased deferred 
income of ThUS$236,257 and other 
miscellaneous non-financial liabilities 
worth ThUS$7,528.
The indebtedness indicator of the 
company’s current Liabilities for the 
period stood at 1.75. The impact 
of current Liabilities on total debt 
increased by 19.12 percentage points, 
from 41.41% at yearend 20202 to 
60.53% at the end of the current period. 
The company’s non-current Liabilities 
decreased by THUS$2,557,578 (24.1%), 
compared to the sum reached by 
December 31, 2020. The main decreases 
are seen under Other non-current 
financial liabilities by ThUS$1,855.099 
(23.8%). This variation is mainly explained 
by decreases in debt losses due to fleet rejections for ThUS$999,782 and 
movements due to fleet renegotiations 
and other reclassifications to the current 
heading worth ThUS$1,090,885, offset 
by other movements of the period for 
ThUS$235,568.
The other decreases are presented 
under Accounts Payable to Related 
Entities, Non-Current for ThUS$396,423 
(100%) explained mainly by the net 
effect of reclassification of balance to 
current position according to the terms 
of the DIP financing contract; Other 
non-financial liabilities, non-current 
for ThUS$189,952 (27 .1%), primarily 
explained by the decrease in deferred 
income and reclassification to the current 
compensation position of Delta Air 
Lines, Inc., offset by an increase in Other 
provisions, non-current by ThUS$124,222 
(21.1%), explained by increases in tax 
contingencies by ThUS$125,875, Labor 
contingencies of ThUS$50,139, and 
the net effect decrease of provisions 
of onerous contracts and other minor 
provisions for ThUS$51,792.
The indebtedness indicator of the 
company’s Non-current Liabilities stood 
at (1.14). The impact of non-current 
Liabilities on total debt decreased by 
19.12 percentage points, from 58.59% 
at yearend 2020 to 39.47% at the end 
of December 2021.The indicator of total indebtedness on 
the Company’s assets at the end of 
December 2021 is (2.89), 4.54 times 
lower than at the end of December 2020.
At the end of December 2021, the 
Company did not maintain current interest 
rate derivatives positions. Currently, 40% 
(42% by December 31, 2020) of the debt 
is fixed in the face of fluctuations in 
interest rates. Most of this debt is indexed 
at the reference rate based on LIBOR. 
Considering these hedges, the average 
rate on the debt is 5.69%.
The Equity attributable to the owners 
of the parent company decreased 
by ThUS$4,620,835 from a negative 
equity of ThUS$2,435,713 at December 
31, 2020 to a negative equity of 
ThUS$7,056,548 by December 31, 
2021. The main effects correspond to 
the year’s result attributable to the 
owners of the controller, corresponding 
to a loss of ThUS$4,647,491, a 
conversion adjustment of ThUS$18,354, 
and other increments in the year by 
ThUS$8,302.2. CONSOLIDATED  
INCOME STATEMENT
At December 31, 2021, the controller 
reported a loss of ThUS$4,647,491, 
representing a negative variance of 
ThUS$101,604 compared to a loss of 
ThUS$4,545,887 in the same period last 
year. Net margin for the financial year 
settled at -90.9% in 2021 and -104.9% 
during 2020.
The operating results for the twelve 
months of 2021 amount to a loss of 
ThUS$1,119,277 which, compared to 
the loss of ThUS$1,665,288 as at 31 
December 2020, shows a variation 
equivalent to 32.8%, while operating 
margin reaches -21.9%, 16.5 percentage 
points below the margin of -38.4% as at 
31 December 2020.
Operating income for the financial year 
increased 17 .9% vs. the same period of 
2020, totaling THUS$5,111,346. This 
increase is largely due to a 23.2% rise in 
passenger revenues and 27 .4% in cargo 
revenues, while Other revenues decreased 
by 44.7%. The effect of the Brazilian real’s 
depreciation represents lower ordinary 
revenues by around US$40 million.
During June 2020, the indefinite 
cessation of operations of LATAM Airlines 
Argentina S.A. was announced, due to 
local industry conditions aggravated by 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 297the COVID-19 pandemic, whereby the 
airline stopped operating 12 domestic 
destinations. At the end of 2020, 
LATAM Airlines Argentina S.A. reported 
Operating revenues of US$50 million in 
its Individual income statement.
PAX revenues totaled THUS$3,342,381 
which, compared to the 
THUS$2,713,774 from the twelve 
months of 2020, translates into a 23.2% 
increase. This variation is due to the 
18.0% increase in demand measured 
in RPK (revenue passenger-kilometer) 
and 4.3% in the yields compared to the 
previous year, while load factor shows 
a negative variation of 2.1 percentage 
points from the financial year 2020; on 
the other hand, RASK (revenue per ASK 
– Available Seat-Kilometer) reported a 
1.4% increase, explained by the recovery 
of demand thanks to the lifting of 
quarantines and travel restrictions since 
the second half of the current year.
As at 31 December 2021, cargo 
revenues reached ThUS$1,541,634, a 
27 .4% increase from 2020. Despite the 
1.4% drop in RTK traffic, yields increased 
29.2%, driven mainly by a strong import 
and export scenario.
The Other Income line item shows 
a decrease of ThUS$183,671 due 
mainly to a fall of ThUS$55,990 in Tour Services and Airplane Leasing, in 
addition to the compensation received 
for the cancellation of the purchase of 
four A350 aircraft from Delta Air Lines 
Inc. for ThUS$62,000 and ThUS$9,240 
for the advance return of leased aircraft 
to Qatar Airways, both during the 
second quarter of 2020, together with 
the negative change in compensation 
income for ThUS$14,279, received from 
Delta Air Lines Inc. associated with 
the implementation of the JBA (joint 
business agreement) signed in 2019.
At December 31, 2021, operating 
costs totaled THUS$6,230,623 which, 
compared to 2020, translate into higher 
costs by THUS$230,666, equivalent to a 
3.8% increase, whereas unit cost per ASK 
decreased by 14.5%. Furthermore, the 
effect of the Brazilian Real’s depreciation 
on this line item translates into lower 
costs by roughly US$38 million. Item 
variations are explained as follows:
a) Remunerations and benefits increased 
ThUS$79,839 due to higher recognized 
expenditures for performance bonuses, 
which were suspended during financial 
year 2020, partly offset by an 18% 
decline in the average payroll compared 
to the previous year.
b) Fuel increased 42.3%, equivalent 
to ThUS$442,433. This increase corresponds mainly to 25.4% higher 
average unhedged prices and 15.5% 
growth in consumption measured 
in gallons. LATAM recognized a 
ThUS$10,100 fuel hedge profit in 2021, 
compared to a ThUS$14,316 loss in the 
twelve months of 2020.
c) Commissions show a decrease of 
ThUS$2,701, as a result of the increase 
in direct sales in own agencies and 
digital media during 2021.
d) Depreciation and Amortization 
decreased by ThUS$223,992, mainly 
explained by a smaller average 
fleet during 2021 and the penalties 
levied in the previous year due to 
the accelerated term of IT projects 
resulting from the implementation of 
the LATAM XP digital platform.
e) Other Leases and Landing Fees 
increased ThUS$35,183, mainly in 
handling costs, impacted by the recovery 
of the operation during the second half 
of 2021 and offset by lower airport fees.
f) Passenger Service decreased by 
ThUS$20,325, representing a variation 
of 20.8%, mainly due to restrictions on 
in-flight catering services, imposed as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
lower costs of passenger assistance due 
to contingencies. g) Aircraft Lease costs for 
ThUS$120,630. Since the second 
quarter of 2021, operational aircraft 
leases under variable mode were 
reported, as a result of the various 
agreements reached by the group.
Aircraft Leasing includes the costs 
associated with leasing payments by the 
hour (PBH) for contracts that have been 
modified by incorporating that structure. 
For these contracts that include variable 
payments by the hour (PBH) at the 
beginning of the period and after that, 
have fixed fees, an asset by right of use 
and lease liability were recognized for 
these amounts at the date of contract 
modification. These sums continue to 
be amortized on a linear basis during 
the term of the lease from the date of 
contract modification, even if at the 
beginning they have a variable payment 
period. Therefore, and as a result of the 
application of the lease accounting policy, 
the result of the period includes both the 
leasing expense for variable payments 
(Aircraft leasing) as well as the expense 
resulting from the amortization of the 
right of use included in the depreciation 
line and the interest on the lease liability.
h) Maintenance has higher costs by 
ThUS$61,356, equivalent to 13.0%, 
mainly due to a higher operation since 
the second half of the current year.
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 298i) The Other Operating Costs show a 
decrease of ThUS$261,757, mainly due 
to adjustments in the estimates of write-
offs and tax, labor, and civil proceedings.
Financial revenues totaled ThUS$21,107 
which, compared to ThUS$50,397 in 
2020, represent lower revenues by 
ThUS$29,290. Despite higher cash 
levels during the six-month period 
compared to the same period in 2020, 
this reduction is due to the limitations 
of Chapter 11 on the group’s cash 
management, requiring 70% of the cash 
to be maintained in authorized banks.
Financial Costs increased 37 .2% totaling 
ThUS$805,544 by December 31, 2021. 
The draft of DIP (debtor in possession) 
financing during the fourth quarter of 
2020, in addition to the three drafts in 
June, November, and December 2021, 
increased debt by US$1.95 billion, 
with a higher interest rate, leading to 
an increase of approximately US$330 
million in interest earned.
The other income/costs as at December 
31, 2021 showed a positive change 
of ThUS$723,360. The contingency 
generated by the COVID-19 pandemic 
affected the group’s operations, showing 
signs of impairment that required the 
carrying out of impairment tests resulting 
in the penalization of the total goodwill by US$1.72 billion, US$37 million from 
the penalization of airport slots and 
US$81 million from fuel hedge contracts, 
all of which generated a loss during the 
first quarter of 2020, partly offset by 
higher reorganization costs during 2021, 
equivalent to US$1.34 billion.
The main line items in the Consolidated 
Financial Statement of TAM S.A. and 
Affiliates, which caused a currency 
exchange loss of ThUS$3,973 at 
December 31, 2021, were: Other 
financial liabilities; THUS$75 loss 
from USD-denominated loans and 
financial leasing for fleet acquisitions; 
net accounts receivable and payable 
to related companies, totaling a gain 
of THUS$17,970, and net accounts 
receivable and payable to third parties, 
totaling a loss of THUS$27,187 .  
The other line items of net assets 
and liabilities generated a loss of 
THUS$11,023.3. ANAL YSIS AND EXPLANATION 
OF CONSOLIDATED NET CASH 
FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATION, 
INVESTMENT, AND FINANCING 
ACTIVITIES 
The Company’s cash flow, after the 
first quarter of 2020, has been affected 
mainly by the decrease in passenger 
transport operations due to border 
shutdowns and quarantine periods 
designed to control the COVID 19 
pandemic in the countries where the 
Company operates, and due to the filing 
of voluntary requests for reorganization 
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy 
Code of the United States of America, 
which has allowed the protection of the 
Company’s liquidity.
The Operating Cash Flow as at December 
31, 2021, shows a positive change of 
ThUS$310,598 over the previous year, due 
to the positive change in Receipts from 
Sales of Goods and Service Rendering 
for ThUS$739,369, Payments to and on 
Behalf of Employees for ThUS$285,942, 
and Income Taxes Rebates for 
ThUS$56,255. This is offset by negative 
changes in Payments to Suppliers for 
the provision of goods, whose variations 
originate from the higher payments made 
by ThUS$584,146, Other Cash Inflows 
(Outflows) by ThUS$101,169 and Other 
Payments for Operating Activities by 
ThUS$85,837 .The negative ThUS$101,169 variation 
in the Other Cash Inflows and Outflows 
in Operating Cash Flow is mainly due to 
the variation in Delta’s compensation 
for ThUS$62,000, Derivatives 
Premiums and Margin Guarantees for 
ThUS$32,990, ThUS$54,851 Court 
Deposits and Bank Fees, Taxes and 
Others for ThUS$16,727, offset by a 
positive variation of ThUS$60,848 in 
Fuel Derivatives transactions.
Flow from Investment Activities shows 
a negative variation of ThUS$576,261 
compared to the previous period, given 
the negative changes in the following 
items: Purchases of Property, Plant, 
and Equipment and purchases of 
intangible assets for ThUS$262,981 
and ThUS$13,085, respectively, Interest 
accrued of ThUS$27,803 and the net 
effect between Other receipts for the 
sale of equity or debt instruments of 
other entities and Other payments 
for the acquisition of equity or debt 
instruments of other entities by 
ThUS$323,245. This was slightly offset 
by positive variations in: Sums derived 
from the sale of property, plant, and 
equipment for ThUS$29,434 and other 
cash inflows (outflows) for ThUS$20,667 .
Cash flow from financing activities 
shows a negative variation of 
ThUS$1,011,187, compared to the 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 299previous year, which is explained by 
the following negative variations: Sums 
from short- and long-term loans for 
ThUS$1,323,871 and related loans 
for ThUS$243,023. This variation is 
offset by the following concepts: Loan 
Payments of ThUS$330,664, Interest 
Paid of ThUS$105,797, Other Cash 
Inflows (Outflows) of ThUS$96,754, 
and Payment of Lease Liabilities of 
ThUS$18,696, among others.
The flows from loans described above 
include the following events: 
(1) During March and April 2020, LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. withdrew the entire 
(US$600 million) committed credit 
line “Revolving Credit Facility (RCF)” . 
The financing matures on March 29, 
2022. The credit line is guaranteed with 
collateral consisting of aircraft, engines, 
and spare parts.
(2) On May 26, 2020, LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A. and its subsidiaries in Chile, 
Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador filed for 
protection under Chapter 11 of the 
United States bankruptcy law in the 
Southern District Court of New York. 
Under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy 
Code. The same was true for TAM LINHAS 
AEREAS S.A. and its subsidiaries (all 
LATAM subsidiaries in Brazil), on July 9, 
2020. Filing for Chapter 11 automatically suspends most actions against LATAM 
and its subsidiaries, including most 
actions to collect financial obligations 
incurred prior to the date of filing for 
Chapter 11, or to exercise control over 
the property of LATAM and its affiliates. 
Consequently, although the bankruptcy 
filing may have resulted in non-
compliance with some of LATAM’s and its 
subsidiaries’ obligations, counterparties 
may not take any action as a result of 
such non-compliance.
At the end of the financial year, Chapter 
11 retains most of the actions against 
debtors, so debt repayment does not 
accelerate. The group continues to 
submit its financial information as at 
December 31, 2021, including its financial 
debt and leases, in accordance with the 
terms originally agreed, pending future 
agreements it may reach with its creditors 
under Chapter 11. For agreements 
that have already been modified or 
extinguished, financial information has 
been disclosed in accordance with the 
new terms and conditions.
(3) On June 24, 2020, the United States 
Southern District Court of New York 
approved LATAM’s motion to reject 
certain aircraft lease contracts. The 
rejected contracts included 17 aircraft 
financed under the EETC structure 
amounting to US$844.1 million, and one aircraft financed with a financial lease 
of US$4.5 million.
(4) On October 20, 2020, the United 
States Court for the Southern District 
of New York approved LATAM’s motion 
to reject an aircraft leasing contract 
financed under a financial lease in the 
amount of US$34.3 million.
(5) On September 29, 2020, LATAM 
Airlines Group S.A. obtained debtor in 
possession (“DIP”) financing for a total of 
US$2.45 billion, consisting of US$1.30 
billion of one tranche A (“Tranche A”) 
and US$1.15 billion of one tranche 
C (“Tranche C”), US$750 million of 
which are provided by related parties. 
Obligations under DIP are guaranteed by 
collateral consisting of certain assets of 
LATAM and certain of its subsidiaries, 
including, but not limited to, shares, 
certain engines, and spare parts.
On October 8, 2020, LATAM made a 
partial withdrawal for US$1.15 billion on 
Tranche A and Tranche C, and then, on or 
around June 22, 2021, LATAM made an 
additional withdrawal of US$500 million 
on Tranche A and Tranche C.
On October 18, 2021, LATAM Airlines 
Group S.A. obtained Court approval for 
a tranche B (“Tranche B”) of debtor in 
possession (“DIP”) financing  for a total of up to US$750 million. The obligations 
of this Tranche B, like the previous 
tranches, are guaranteed with the same 
collateral provided by LATAM and its 
subsidiaries subject to the Chapter 11 
proceeding, without limitation, including 
stocks, certain engines, and spare parts. 
The next DIP drafts must be made on 
Tranche B until the ratio drawn of the 
latter is equal to that of the previous 
tranches. Once this ratio is equal, the 
drafts are pro-rata.
On November 10, 2021, the group made 
a partial withdrawal of US$200 million 
of Tranche B and later, on December 
28, 2021, LATAM made a new draft 
of US$100 million. Following these 
drafts, LATAM still has US$1.25 million 
available for future withdrawals.
The maturity of the DIP is April 8, 2022, 
subject to potential extension, at LATAM’s 
choice, for an additional 60 days in the 
event that the LATAM reorganization plan 
is confirmed by a U.S. Court order from 
the Southern District of New York, but 
the plan is not yet effective.
(6) On March 31, 2021, the United 
States Southern District Court of New 
York approved and subsequently issued 
an order dated April 13, 2021, approving 
the group’s motion to extend certain 
lease contracts on 3 aircraft.
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 300(7) On June 17, 2021, the United States 
Southern District Court of New York 
approved the group’s motion to reject 
the lease contract for a financial lease-
financed aircraft worth US$130.7 million.
(8) On June 30, 2021, the United States 
Southern District Court of New York 
approved the group’s motion to reject 
the lease contract for 3 financial lease-
financed aircraft worth US$307 .4 million.
(9) On November 1, 2021, the United 
States Southern District Court of New 
York approved the group’s motion to reject 
the lease contract for 1 financial lease-
financed engine worth US$19.5 million.
Last, the company’s net cash flow as at 
December 31, 2021, prior to the effects 
of exchange rate differences, shows a 
negative variation of ThUS$1,276,850, 
compared to the previous year.
4. FINANCIAL RISK ANAL YSIS
The goal of the Company’s global risk 
management program is to minimize 
the adverse effects of the financial risks 
that affect the group.
(a) Market risk
Given the nature of its business, the 
Company is exposed to market factors, 
such as: (i) fuel price risk, (ii) interest rate 
risk, and (iii) local exchange rate risk.(i) Fuel price risk
To carry out its operations, the Company 
purchases fuel known as USGC 54 grade 
Jet Fuel, which is subject to variations in 
international fuel prices.
To hedge against fuel risk exposure, the 
Company trades in derivatives instruments 
(Swaps and Options) whose underlying 
assets may be different from Jet Fuel, 
whereby it is possible to hedge in West 
Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”), Brent 
crude oil (“BRENT”), and distilled Heating 
Oil (”HO”), which are closely related to Jet 
Fuel and have greater liquidity.
At December 31, 2021, the Company 
recognized a US$10.13 billion gain from 
fuel hedges net of premiums on the 
cost of sales of the period. Part of the 
spreads resulting between the lower and 
higher market value of these contracts is 
recognized as a hedge reserves component 
in the company’s net equity. At December 
31, 2021, the market value of existing 
contracts stood at ThUS$17,641.
(ii) Exchange rate risk
The functional currency, also used 
in presenting the Parent company’s 
Financial Statements, is the US dollar; 
therefore, Transactional and Conversion 
exchange rate risks are mainly a result 
of the operating activities of the 
business, as well as the company’s strategic and accounting activities, 
which are presented in monetary units 
other than the functional currency.
LATAM's Affiliates are also exposed to 
exchange rate risk, whose impact affects 
the Company’s Consolidated Result.
The greatest exposure to exchange 
rate risk for LATAM comes from the 
concentration of businesses in Brazil, 
as they are mainly denominated in 
Brazilian Reals (BRL), and it is managed 
actively by the Company.
The Company minimizes exchange 
risk exposure by contracting derivative 
instruments or through natural hedges 
or the execution of internal transactions.
At December 31, 2021, the Company 
had no active F/X contracts.
During the period ended on December 
31, 2021, the Company did not recognize 
gains from F/X hedges net of premiums. 
During the same period in 2020, the 
Company recognized a gain of THUS$3.24 
from F/X hedges net of premiums.
(iii) Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to variations in 
interest rates on the markets, affecting 
the future cash flows of its current and 
future financial assets and liabilities.The Company is mainly exposed to the 
London Inter Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) 
and other less relevant interest rates, such 
as Brazilian Interbank Deposit Certificates 
(“CDI” , for its Portuguese acronym).
At December 31, 2021, roughly 40% of 
the debt has a fixed rate or is linked to 
one of the financial hedging instruments 
arranged. Considering these hedges, the 
average rate on the debt is 5.69%.
On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark 
Administration (“IBA”) announced that, 
as a result of the poor access to the 
information needed to calculate the 
rates, the release of the USD 1-week 
and 2-month rates will cease on 
December 31, 2021, and for all other 
terms, on June 30, 2023. Although 
the adoption of alternative rates is 
voluntary, the imminent interruption 
of LIBOR makes it essential for market 
participants to consider moving to 
alternative rates, such as SOFR and 
have appropriate alternative language 
in existing contracts that refer to 
the discontinuance of LIBOR. In this 
regard, the Company identifies that 
its derivative and debt contracts may 
be affected by the change in the 
relevant rate. To mitigate the effect, the 
Company is evaluating adherence to the 
ISDA protocol in the case of derivatives 
and is following the recommendations 
Integrated Report 2021
Financial Information 301of the relevant authorities, including the 
Alternative Reference Rates Committee 
(“ARRC”) in the case of debt, in line 
with the measures generally adopted 
by the market to replace LIBOR in debt 
contracts. In the case of derivatives, 
LATAM does not maintain current 
contracts indexed to the LIBOR rate.
(b) Concentration of credit risk
A high percentage of the Company’s 
accounts receivables comes from 
passengers, cargo services for 
individuals, and various trade companies 
that are spread out both economically 
and geographically; thus, they are 
generally short term. Thereby, the 
Company is not exposed to a significant 
concentration of credit risk.
5. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
In order to analyze the economic 
environment in which the Company exists, 
below we present a brief explanation 
of the situation and evolution of the 
main economies that affect it nationally, 
regionally, and worldwide.
In the midst of the spread of the new 
omicron variant of COVID-19 and the 
emergence of significant inflationary 
pressures, the global economy has 
begun 2022 in a weaker position than 
previously expected. On the one hand, 
the omicron variant has led some countries to reimpose certain mobility 
restrictions, while disruptions in the 
logistics chain and rising oil and energy 
prices have generated high levels of 
inflation. These have mainly affected 
the United States and emerging and 
developing economies. The International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) expects 
inflationary pressures to last longer 
than previously estimated, as a result 
of the 2022 continuity of disruptions 
in the logistics chain and high energy 
prices, and it should gradually decrease 
during the year as the supply-demand 
imbalances balance out, and with the 
implementation of monetary policies 
in major economies. In addition, in the 
context of the war between Russia and 
Ukraine and the effects of this conflict 
on the oil supply, there has been a sharp 
rise in fuel prices, a factor that could 
continue to significantly impact global 
inflationary pressures.
In line with this challenging environment 
for the global economy, the IMF’s 
latest projections consider a cross-
cutting downward adjustment between 
economies for new factors not foreseen 
in the previous projection related to 
the early withdrawal of fiscal stimulus 
mainly in the US, disruptions in the 
logistics chain, the spread of the 
omicron variant, and the instability of 
the real estate sector in China. However, in its last projection in January 2022, 
the IMF estimated growth of 5.9% for 
the global economy in 2021, while 
it projected growth of 4.4% in 2022, 
0.5 percentage points (p.p.) below the 
previous estimate, and a more moderate 
growth of 3.8% in 2023.
For the United States, the IMF has 
estimated a 4.0% expansion for 
2022 in its last January projection, 
0.6 percentage points below the last 
October 2021 estimate, in response 
to the early withdrawal of monetary 
policies and the continuation of 
disruptions in the logistics chain; and a 
growth of 2.6% for 2023, 0.4 p.p. above 
the previous estimate. On the other 
hand, IMF estimates for Europe during 
2022 have also been revised downwards 
from the previous estimate, expecting 
a growth of 3.9% in 2022, 0.4 p.p. lower versus the previous estimate; and a 
2.5% expansion by 2023, 0.5 p.p. above 
the last estimate. 
On the other hand, the IMF estimated 
growth of 2.4% for the Latin America 
and Caribbean region during 2022, 
0.6 percentage points below the 
previous October 2021 forecast, and 
an expansion of 2.6% for 2023. Brazil’s 
economy is expected to grow by 0.3% 
in 2022, which is 1.2 percentage points 
below the previous estimate, while for 
Chile, the Central Bank estimated in its 
last Monetary Policy Report (IPoM, for 
its Spanish acronym) in December 2021 
an economic expansion in the range of 
1.5 to 2.5% by 2022.
