Responsibility throughout
At IGM Financial, we are in the business of 
helping Canadians to plan for and achieve their  
financial goals.  Because of the trust placed in 
us, we have a long-standing commitment to act 
responsibly in everything we do.
We believe that considering the environmental, 
social, and governance impacts of our business 
contributes to long-term sustainable value. We 
are living in a time when companies around 
the world are being encouraged to disclose and  
address these impacts. Our Corporate Respon -
sibility Report tells our story about the issues  
important to our clients, the financial advisors 
and Consultants who serve them, our employees,  
our shareholders, and our communities. 
In 2013 we reached several milestones:
3 We built a six-pillar strategic approach to  
corporate responsibility and our Board of  
Directors formalized a Corporate Responsibility  
Statement. 
3 We created a governance framework and  
established leadership for corporate  
responsibility efforts across IGM Financial.
3 We participated for the first time in the Carbon 
Disclosure Project survey, ranking among the 
top companies in the financial sector in Canada.3 Investors Group and Mackenzie Investments 
began preparations to become signatories 
to the Principles for Responsible Investment 
and proudly accomplished this in 2014. 
3 We were named a global employer of  
choice by the Cambridge University  
Students’ Union. 
We’re putting our corporate responsibility  
strategy into action with affiliated companies Power 
Financial Corporation and Great-West Lifeco. 
We’re proud of our achievements, our commit -
ments and our people. At the same time, we 
know there is more we can do to engage our 
stakeholders, grow our strategy, and measure 
and enhance our public reporting on our corpo -
rate responsibility performance. 
We are committed to building on the foundation 
we have created in the years ahead. We know 
that our actions matter and that our sustainability  
as an organization is closely tied to the sustain -
ability of the people, the places and the environ -
ment we rely on. 
Responsibility throughout. It’s a goal we continually 
strive to meet.Murray J. Taylor  Jeffrey R. Carney

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
In 2013, our Board of Directors formalized our 
Corporate Responsibility Statement reflecting the 
core values that have and will continue to guide us:
Our Commitment to Corporate Responsibility
In addition to meeting ethical standards in  
accordance with the firm’s Code of Conduct, and 
complying with applicable laws and regulations, 
IGM Financial strives to:
3 uphold principles, policies and procedures 
that promote integrity and risk management;
3 provide value to our clients and the financial 
advisors who serve them through excellence 
in our product, service and support offerings;
3 advance the financial literacy and financial 
security of Canadians;
3 cultivate a rewarding and progressive  
workplace for our people;
3 support and respect the protection of  
internationally proclaimed human rights 
wherever we operate;
3 manage our environmental footprint responsibly;  
3 make a positive contribution in the communities  
where we operate; and
3 have a positive impact on the economy while 
delivering long-term value to our shareholders.EXTERNAL COMMITMENTS  
In addition, I GM Financial has addressed some 
key external sustainability commitments and 
standards. 
3 IGM Financial took part in its first CDP  
survey in 2013. The CDP is an independent,  
investor-driven organization which facilitates 
the measurement and disclosure of the 
greenhouse gas emissions requested from 
over 5,000 of the world’s largest companies 
on behalf of 767 investors, representing  
US $92 trillion in assets.  
3 Creation of this report has been guided  
by the reporting principles of the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI), a sustainability 
reporting framework that is widely used 
around the world. We have used the GRI  
G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines,  
including the Financial Services Supplement.  
3 In 2014, Investors Group and Mackenzie  
Investments became signatories to the  
United Nations-supported Principles for  
Responsible Investment (PRI), which  
includes a commitment to formally  
incorporate and report on environmental, 
social and governance (ESG)  issues in our 
investment processes. The UN PRI initiative is an international network,  
representing more than 1,260 signatories with  
US $45 trillion in assets, who are working together  
to put the following six principles for responsible 
investment into practice:
Principle 1: We will incorporate ESG issues into  
investment analysis and decision-making processes.
Principle 2: We will be active owners and  
incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies  
and practices.
Principle 3: We will seek appropriate disclosure 
on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest.
Principle 4: We will promote acceptance and  
implementation of the Principles within the  
investment industry.
Principle 5: We will work together to enhance our  
effectiveness in implementing the Principles.
Principle 6: We will each report on our activities 
and progress towards implementing the Principles.

Priorities for corporate responsibility across IGM Financial
Our strategy starts at the top, gu ided by our Corporate Responsibility Statement approved by the Board of Directors.  We have a commitment  
to operate our business with integrity and focus on our impacts across our economy, clients, people, environment and communities. 
Our six-pillar strategic approach to corp orate responsibility will focus the efforts of IGM Financial and its operating companies on the  
following priorities for the coming three to five years:

CLIENTS 3 Annual client surveys

3 Advisor/Consultant surveys seeking  
feedback they receive from clients 3 In response to growing client interest in responsible investing, we began formalizing

3 We communicated our findings and plans to employees.

3 Financial literacy publications and website3 Investors Group and the Canadian Foundation for Economic Education relaunched its  
Money and Youth program with significant input from educators. 
3 See the 2013 Mackenzie Community Investment Report and the 2013 Investors Group Corporate 
Citizenship report for detailed engagement information. Stakeholder engagement
To develop this report, we asked our business leaders to reflect on stakeholder feedback received over the past year, either directly or through external  
mechanisms. Most of our engagement takes place on a day-to-day basis through ongoing interactions with our clients, employees, shareholders, and the  
financial advisors who distribute our products and services. We directly engage with stakeholders who have an impact on our business or who are impacted by us.  
In preparing our first report, we have not formally engaged our stakeholders specifically on corporate responsibility topics. We are considering how to address 
this as our strategy evolves.  
7OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY OUR ECONOMY OUR CLIENTS OUR PEOPLE OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR COMMUNITIESGuided by the GRI G4 Principles for Defining  
Report Content and an external consultant, we  
developed a process to identify a wide range of  
social, environmental, and economic topics  
relevant to our sta keholders and our Company.  
When identifying topics we considered emerging  
trends, the GRI G4 specific and financial  
services sector aspects, the GRI stakeholder  
topics for sectors and issues relevant to our  
industry peer group.     
We worked with our business leaders to rank  
the importance of these relevant topics for 
IGM Financial and our operating companies by  
assessing a broad range of business impacts,  
including those that were organizational,  
financial, reputational, regulatory, societal,  
environmental, and related to market forces.  
We also ranked the interests of our stakeholders  
by considering feedback we receive from  
investors, advisors, employees, clients, and our 
communities at large. We considered issues  
addressed in the media, industry research and 
advocacy, matters raised in public debate, direct 
engagement with individual stakeholders, and 
survey results. The process used to define report topics and the 
rankings was reviewed by our steering committee  
and Corporate Responsibility Committee. Our  
approach to report on topics ranking at or above 
a medium importance in 2013, both to our  
Company and stakeholders, was approved by our  
Corporate Responsibility Committee. We determined the impacts of our report topics 
within and outside IGM Financial and its operating  
companies. Our impacts can be found here. 
We will review our report topics and analysis on a 
regular basis to incorporate new knowledge and  
issues as they arise.Our report topics

OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY  OUR ECONOMY OUR CLIENTS OUR PEOPLE OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR COMMUNITIESBOARD OF DIRECTORS
Our Board of Directors plays a central role in the 
governance process. The mandate of the Board, 
which it discharges directly or through one of seven  
Board committees, is to supervise the manage -
ment of the business and affairs of the Company. 
The Board is led by a non-executive Chair. It has 
effective structures and procedures in place to 
ensure its independence from management and  
to ensure that conflicts of interest between the 
Company and any of its related parties are dealt 
with appropriately.
CORPORATE  
RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE  
In 2013 the Board approved our Corporate  
Responsibility Statement, which formalized our long-  
standing commitment to corporate responsibility.  
The Executive Committee of the Board monitors 
implementation of the Company’s policy and 
strategy with respect to corporate responsibility. In 
2013, we discussed our corporate responsibility  
plans for the coming year with the committee to 
deepen their knowledge of environmental, social, 
and governance issues.     The Senior Vice-President and Treasurer is the  
appointed corporate responsibility lead and chairs 
the Corporate Responsibility Committee. Committee 
members are as follows:
3  Co-Presidents and Chief Executive Officers
3  Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial 
Officer 
3  Senior Vice-President, General Counsel and 
Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer
3  Senior Vice-President and Treasurer 
The committee is responsible for ensuring the  
implementation of corporate responsibility policy 
and strategy and for approving our annual corporate  
responsibility report. They report to the Executive 
Committee of the Board on an annual basis  or 
as necessary where critical concerns arise. No 
critical concerns were raised in 2013. 
Supporting the Corporate Responsibility Committee  
is a steering committee that has representation  
from across the operating companies. It meets 
quarterly to provide recommendations on  
implementing policy, strategy and annual plans.  
An Environmental Committee operates as a  
sub-committee of the steering committee.

includes well-defined governance responsibilities. 
GOVERNANCE OF RISK
The Executive Committee of the Board is  
responsible for ensuring appropriate ERM policies,

Significant risks and opportunities related to  
economic, environmental and social impacts are

ERM framework is in place, including policies and 
processes, defining risk appetite and establishing  
“tone at the top” to reinforce a culture of risk  management. The Risk Management Committee is 
accountable to the Executive Committee of the Board.
The ERM Department develops and maintains the 
ERM program, framework and processes; provides 
risk management guidance and training to the  
company; and provides oversight, analysis and  
reporting to the Risk Management Committee. The leaders of our various business units are

Board and executives have created a framework to support a culture of compliance across the Company to  
ensure internal standards, policies, laws and regulations are followed in all aspects of our business.  
IGM Financial’s main operating companies – Investors Group, Mackenzie Investments and Investment

CONDUCT PRINCIPLES ANNUALLYOPERATIONAL INTEGRITY  OUR ECONOMY OUR CLIENTS OUR PEOPLE OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR COMMUNITIES14Knowing our clients and products 
In keeping with our commitment to clients,  
securities requirements and internal policies,  
advisors affiliated with Investors Group and Invest -
ment Planning Counsel are expected to make a  
diligent effort to understand and document the 
financial and personal situation of every client to 
ensure the suitability of their investments for their 
particular circumstances.  This information is  
reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it remains 
accurate. Mackenzie Investments distributes its 
products through third-party advisors and dealers.
Our securities dealers and advisors are also  
responsible for conducting due diligence on all 
products that are available for sale to clients. A 
team of experts reviews and assesses our products 
to ensure they are suitable to offer to our clients.  
Our Enterprise Risk Management Framework also 
provides a comprehensive IGM-wide process to 
ensure product-related risks are managed on an 
ongoing basis.   
Responsible investing and proxy voting
As signatories to the Principles for Responsible 
Investment (PRI), our investment management 
operations incorporate environmental, social, and 
governance issues into their investment processes  
and actively engage with the management of  companies our funds invest in. Proxy voting is an 
important component of responsible investing, and 
consistent with our responsibility, we vote proxies 
in the best interests of the funds. Our investment 
management oversight function monitors our 
proxy voting.  Responsible investing policies and 
proxy voting policies and procedures establish the 
principles that govern these activities.
PROTECTING CLIENT INFORMATION 
AND MAINTAINING TRUST
Privacy protection and fraud prevention 
We take the safeguarding of client, employee 
and other individuals’ personal information very 
seriously.  In accordance with Canadian privacy  
laws, we only collect information necessary to 
our business and we divulge information about  
clients only as required by law, when necessary to  
provide products or services to them, or as otherwise  
authorized by them.  
We have established specific privacy guidelines  
relating to the collection, use and disclosure of  
personal information. We also have well-  
established procedures relating to the protection of  
confidential information from theft, loss,  
unauthorized disclosure, access or destruction or oth -
er misuse.  Our Board and employees must sign off 
on standards contained within the Code of Conduct.  Information security
Information security is of utmost importance to  
the Company. Through our affiliation with the  
Power Financial Corporation group of companies, 
we have the strength and efficiency of an integrated  
information technology platform that is both global 
in scale and expertise.  
We have a comprehensive information security  
program that underpins our information security

is essential to protecting our clients’ information 
and to their maintaining trust and confidence in us.

In 2013, Investors Group earned the prestigious  
Investor Education Award for the enhanced Money

partnered with the Canadian Foundation for Economic 
Education  to offer the program. The Money and Youth text-  
book and website are free to Canadian teachers to use 
with their students in any of the high school grades. The 
book has been used in school programs around the world 
and has been translated into a number of languages .  
Money and Youth, along with the Building Futures  
financial literacy program that targets students 
in grades 4-10, is a positive result of the 15-year  
partnership between Investors Group and the Canadian

Recent research by the Centre for Interuniversity Research and Analysis of  
Organizations confirms that financial advice significantly helps Canadians save, 
build financial assets and improve retirement readiness. The research demonstrates  
the link between having financial advice and achieving financial goals.
We believe our role in a strong advice-based investment fund industry leads to a stronger  
Canadian econom y. In support of the over 85% of mutual fund investors who prefer to  
invest through a financial advisor,5 we serve Canadians’ investing needs through national  
networks of financial advisors.
3   Mackenzie Investments reaches approximately one million Canadians through 
250 dealer firms, who collectively have 30,000 financial advisors choosing  
to distribute Mackenzie Investments products. Mackenzie University builds the 
financial advice capabilities of these financial advisors.
3   Investors Group has over 4,600 licensed and trained self-employed Investors  
Group Consultants. Industry-leading financial planning and practice management 
training is integral to these advisors providing effective financial advice to nearly  
one million Canadians.

One of the newest Investors Group corporate sponsorships, Investors Group 
Field, is a touchdown for the company and the community in which its head office  
resides. Located on the University of Manitoba’s campus in Winnipeg, Investors 
Group Field opened in May 2013 and is a valuable addition to the city.  Whether  
for a Winnipeg Blue Bombers CFL home game or a headliner entertainment 
event, Winnipeggers come together at Investors Group Field.
Investors Group tries to ensure as many people as possible can experience an 
event at the new stadium.  Each year the company will donate Winnipeg Blue 
Bombers tickets to community members who lack the means to go on their 
own. In 2013, 57 non-profit organizations received tickets.  Accessibility was a consideration in the construction of the stadium for all parts 
of the event experience. There are ramps at most gates, a ticket sales window 
at accessible height, closed captioning on video screens and 180 accessible 
seats in barrier-free seating sections. 
The commitment to Investors Group Field showcases our strong support for  
Winnipeg and also provides value to Canadians nationwide.

LEADERSHIP IN DEMONSTRATING  
THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ADVICE
“IGM is a leader in advocating  
for investment solutions  
delivered with advice,” says  
Murray Taylor, President and  
CEO of Investors Group and 
Co-President and CEO of IGM 
Financial. “Through leader -
ship roles in various industry  
associations like the Investment Funds Institute of 
Canada and through our support for research and 
education in this area, we have shown our unwavering  
commitment to ensuring ongoing access for Canadians 
to valuable financial planning and advice.”
“We see significant differences between Canadians  
who have an advisor versus those who don’t. Those 
who work with an advisor are wealthier.”
There is independent research that attributes the  
differences to three main factors:
3 Planning helps people set and achieve their 
financial targets
3 Those who use an advisor often have better use 
of tax advantaged savings vehicles
3 Advisors help ensure people have the right mix 
of investments
23OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY OUR ECONOMY OUR CLIENTS  OUR PEOPLE OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR COMMUNITIESOUR APPROACH
We take a disciplined approach to both client wealth management and  
managing our business, with an emphasis on planning.  Each of our operating 
companies is responsible for its own product and service offering, including 
those with environmental and social considerations. Having the right products 
and services, providing a rewarding client exper ience and helping our clients 
achieve their financial goals though professional financial advice is key to 
building sustainable, long-term client relationships.  
Financial advisors make up our main distribution channel and we empha -
size support for these advisors as they work with clients to plan for and 
achieve their financial goals.  We seek input from advisors to understand 
and plan for evolving client needs. 
RESPONSIBILITIES  
We have a clearly defined process and reporting structure for the manage -
ment and distribution of our products at each of our operating companies. 
3 Each operating company has its own CEO who reports to a Board of  
Directors that oversees all functions of the company.
3 Each company has a designated investment manager for its funds, governed 
by an independent Board of Directors. All securities owned by the mutual 
funds are held by a custodian, separate from company business.
3 Each company has an Operating Committee of executive management that 
leads the strategic initiatives relating to its operations including product and 
service offerings. TRACKING OUR PERFORMANCE
At Investors Group, strong results in 2013 came because of the company’s 
commitment to the long-term planning needs of its clients supported by 
strong relationships with their advisors. The company views portfolio returns 
and the suitability of client investment portfolios as a way to measure suc -
cess in delivering financial planning to clients.   
At Mackenzie Investments, the goal is to deliver competitive and consistent

and we strive to respond to their needs in an  
ever-changing marketplace through ongoing 
product, servi ce, and support enhancements.  
The business model at each of our operating 
companies is distinct. We solicit feedback from 
clients, where possible. At all three companies,  
generally a client’s first point of contact is through 
their financial advisor. As a result, our relationship 
with advisors is key to the success of our business. 
At both Investors Group and Investment Planning  
Counsel, clients have direct contact with a  
financial advisor who is directly affiliated with 
the company. At Mackenzie Investments, third-  
party advisors distribute the company’s products 
and services. It’s their one-on-one relationship 
with clients that works to ensure people receive 
the personalized financial advice, products and  
services that are right for them.   
All three operating companies have in-house  
contact centres to support financial advisors 
in their servicing of cli ents. Each contact centre  
solicits  feedback weekly from a number of advisors  
to identify issues and improve service levels.  
At Investors Group and Mackenzie Investments, clients  
are secondary users of these contact centres. Our primary feedback is from our advisors to 
gauge their own satisfaction levels and, through 
them, better understa nd the over two million  
client relationships they manage on our behalf.
INVESTORS GROUP  
Investors Group is proud of the long-term  
relationships it builds with its nearly one million  
clients, and has annually surveyed its  
clients for more than 15 years. Its Client  
Satisfaction Survey measures various aspects of 
client relationships with Investors Group and their 
Consultant, and their experiences with financial 
planning and advice. In 2014, Investors Group is enhancing its  
commitment to clients through a new Client  
Experience Survey that will provide insight on 
key service questions relating to their relation -
ship with their Consultant. 
Quarterly satisfaction surveys have also been 
cond ucted directly with Investors Group  
Consultants since 2000, surveying each of the 
over 4,600 advisors annually. The purpose of 
these surveys is to measure satisfaction with the

A number of third-party surveys are used to track  
client and advisor satisfaction. Key to its evalua -
tion of client interests is the annual Morningstar  
Canada Stewardship Survey. The survey assesses  
whether fund companies do a good job of aligning 
their interests with fund unit holders. Morningstar  
assigns a letter grade from A (best) to F (worst)  
by evaluating four components: corporate culture,  
manager incentives, fees and regulatory issues.
Of the 19 companies rated, two firms  
received an A grade. Mackenzie was one 
of only two independent investment man -
agement firms to receive a B, an above  
average grade for stewardship.
A key research tool to assess advisor satisfac -
tion is the annual Environics Advisor Perception 
Study, the most comprehensive tracking study of 
Canada’s mutual fund companies. It is a valuable 
benchmark that provides vital information on how 
the company is perceived by the advisors who 
distribute their products. In 2013, Mackenzie was 
noted by advisors as a leader in the breadth of its 
product offerings. 
INVESTMENT PLANNING COUNSEL
At Investment Planning Counsel, an annual  
advisor satisfaction survey has been conduct -
ed since 2007. It measures the satisfaction  
levels of their advisors regarding the support 
and services they receive from the company.  In the 2013 survey, advisors expressed the  
following high levels of satisfaction (on a scale 
of 1 to 5, where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is 
strongly agree).
Investment Planning Counsel:
3 is a company I would truly like to partner 
with: 4.4
3 is a company I share an alignment of  
philosophy and business practices with: 4.3
In 2014, Investment Planning Counsel will launch 
an advisor service index to provide insight  
into what’s important to their advisors  
and to help make improvements as part of their 
2014 theme of “advisor engagement.”
RESOLVING CLIENT COMPLAINTS 
Our o perating companies have formal  
procedures in place to handle written or verbal  
complaints from clients in a fair and timely  
manner.  We are guided by principles of fairness 
and reasonability in our assessment of each issue. 
A client’s first point of resolution is through their 
advisor. Ope rating company call centres can also 
assist with routine inquiries and complaints.  
When problems are escalated to the operating  
companies, the resolution process includes a 
thorough examinat ion of the complaint. The  
investigator contacts the client and engages in a 
personalized review of the client’s concern. The 
client then receives a written summary of the  
investigation addressing their concerns. CLIENT SUCCESS IS OUR 
SUCCESS
In 2013 Mackenzie intro -
duced a new vision and  
strategic plan that trans -
forms the company’s  
approach to doing busi -
ness. After months of  
collaboration and hard work by leaders and  
employees about the company, industry, and 
what was working and what wasn’t, the company 
found its focus in this statement:
We are committed to the financial success of  
investors, through their eyes.
“Through their eyes is really critical,” Jeff Carney, 
Mackenzie President and CEO and Co-President 
and CEO of IGM Financial. “Investors need to  
understand what’s in their portfolio and what to  
expect in terms of performance. In turn, advisors  
need to educate their clients, we have to provide 
the right support to our advisors, and our products 
must be true to their mandates.”
“Everything we do as a firm is viewed from the lens 
of helping investors succeed,” Jeff says. “Their  
success is our success.”

OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY OUR ECONOMY OUR CLIENTS  OUR PEOPLE OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR COMMUNITIESWe believe the vast majority of Canadians are 
best served through the support of a financial  
advisor who sees the big picture and can help them 
build an integrated fina ncial plan for their short- 
and long-term goals.  We have seen the beneficial  
results that are possible when there is trust 
and integrity in the advisor-client relationship  
– and research backs up our experience.  
Results of various studies show that Canadians 
who receive advice are wealthier, more confident  
and better prepared for the financial implications 
of marriage, a new child, their children’s education,  
retirement and other life events. 
We encourage, train, and expect advisors to 
recommend products that are suitable for 
each client’s individual situation. This means 
performing a financial analysis or delivering a 
written financial plan before making product  
recommendations to them. 
In a world that is increasingly complex, we  
believe that it is now more important than ever 
for Canadians to have a financial advisor to  
provide them with a plan that considers an  
appropriate approach for their situation. We con -
tinue to evolve our products, services, support, 
and training so that our advisors can continue to 
enhance the financial well-being of our clients. Value through professional advisors
Results show that Canadians who work with an advisor do better over time
ADVICE MAKES A DIFFERENCE
In 2012, a groundbreaking study from Montreal- based Center for Interuniversity Research and 
Analysis on Organizations showed that people who use an advisor have done better over time. 
After controlling for a host of variables affecting wealth, advised households have, on average, 
twice the level of financial assets when compared to their non-advised counterparts.  This wealth 
is largely attributed to a greater savings discipline. 
This is proof that advice matters – and the benefits increase over time.

AND CHOICE 
While research shows that investors who work with 
advisors have better financial outcomes than those 
who do not, there continues to be discussion around 
the costs of the advice-driven model and how to  
improve clarity and transparency for clients.  
In 2013 enhancements to client reporting rules  
under Phase 2 of the Canadian Securities  
Administrators’ ongoing Client Relationship Model  
reforms were clarified. New rules surrounding  annual  
reporting of fees and personal rates of return will 
come into force in 2016 and must be implemented 
within one year of this date. We believe in transparency  
for our clients and are well prepared for these changes.
We know that some investors have the skills and  
experience to invest on their own. In 2013 Mackenzie  
Investments created a fair solution – their new Series 
D funds. These funds have a reduced dealer service 
fee for do-it-yourself (DIY) investors. 
Both Investors Group and Mackenzie Investments 
continue to be advocates for financial advice for

to this advocacy in 2013. Both companies have  
a strong voice through their leadership roles in  
key industry associations and welcome continued 
dialogue on the subject. FINANCIAL ADVICE KEY FOR LOWER INCOME CANADIANS
The help of a financial advisor makes a difference for Canadians in all age groups 
and income levels – including those in lower income ranges who were not wealthy 
when they sought help from an advisor. This is potentially life changing for these  
people as they head toward their retirement years. We believe in working with  
Canadians at all income levels.

positive social and environmental impacts:
3 The largest suite of retail mutual funds in Canada that abide by  
the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible  
Investment 
3 The Investors Summa SRI Fund – one of the  largest socially

3 Two of the market’s most respected charitable giving funds 
3 Registered Disability Savings Plans
3 Mortgages for energy-efficient homes and renovations that are eligible

3 Various electronic delivery options for our products and services
As part of our regular business operations, our operating companies review 
investment fund offerings to look for opportunities to meet client needs and 
sometimes make difficult decisions to provide for more effective portfolio 
management. Socially and environmentally focused products are included  
as part of this process. In 2012, the Mackenzie Universal Sustainable  
Opportunities Class was terminated (an SRI fund), and the Investors Summa  
Global Environmental Leaders Fund (and corporate class version) was 
merged into another fund. In 2013, the Investors Summa Global SRI™ Fund 
was also merged with another fund. These changes were made due to low 
use of the funds.THE INVESTORS SUMMA SRI FUND
Investors Group has been a pioneer and industry leader in promoting socially  
responsible investing (SRI). Its Investors Summa SRI™ Fund, launched in 
1987, is one of the largest socially responsible funds in Canada. Third-par -
ty global screening services assist with the evaluation of companies against  
specific environmental and/or socially responsible criteria. The fund does not  
invest in companies whose revenues are primarily derived from alcohol, tobacco,  
gambling, pornography or critical weapons systems. Investors Group also offers 
their advisors the opportunity to craft a portfolio for clients that incorporates the 
Investors Summa SRI Fund along with other funds that have been screened for 
their adherence to environmental, social, and governance factors. 
Investors Group is a member of The Responsible Investment Association 
(RIA), a national non-profit, membership-based organization that practices 
and supports responsible investing.

In 2014, Investors Group and Mackenzie  
Investments became signatories to the United 
Nations-supported Principles for Responsible  
Investment (PRI), joining the colla borative  
effort of global investors representing  
US $45 trillion in assets under management  
in the goal to develop a more sustainable 
global financial system. 
“The PRI is well-known 
by pension managers 
and other large inves -
tors, but more attention 
is being placed on sus -
tainability issues by the 
investing public,” said 
Jeff Singer, I.G. Investment Management’s 
Chief Investment Officer. “Considering  
environmental, social and governance factors  
in our investment process is not new to us.  It 
was a natural step as one of Canada’s largest  
mutual fund managers to formalize our 
commitment to responsible investing and 
the PRI across all of our investment funds.”   The UN PRI is a set of six aspirational  
principles that offer a framework for  
integrating environmental, social and  
governance (ESG) factors into the investment  
analysis and decision-making process for 
mainstream investment managers. Inves -
tors Group and Mackenzie Investments 
formalized their commitment knowing  
that companies who practice good ESG  
management are those that demonstrate 
strong performance over the long-term.  
“We are pleased to  
become a signatory –  
we expect institutional  
and retail clients to  
become more aware of 
ESG issues over time,” 
says Tony Elavia, Mack -
enzie Investments’ Chief Investment Officer.  
“PRI differs from socially responsible  
investing where certain investments are  
prohibited in a portfolio due to certain  
values or beliefs. We have equipped our investment teams with additional tools to 
better analyze ESG factors. Our investment 
teams will make their own decisions but 
ESG factors are part of their assessment of 
all investments.” 
Each operating company’s approach to  
responsible investing is outlined in a  
Responsible Investing Policy. Investment 
Planning Counsel implemented a respon -
sible investing policy that is closely aligned 
with the PRI.  See:

Mackenzie Investments and Investors Group are leaders in the provision of donor-advised  
giving programs in Canada. The companies’ charitable giving programs are designed to help donors  
increase and sustain their charitable giving. Clients who open a charitable giving account have the 
advantages of a private foundation without the up-front costs and administrative responsibilities.
Each program is run through a Foundation – a non-profit charitable corporation. The Foundation  
administers the charitable giving funds and applies all or part of the principal and income from those 
funds to eligible charities on behalf of clients.
Supporting hundreds of Canadian charities 
Both companies’ charitable giving programs were established in 2006, and since then, clients have 
contributed more than $134.3 million  to be administered by the Foundation in support of their  
charities of choice. MARKET LEADERS IN REGISTERED  
DISABILITY SAVINGS PLANS
People with disabilities and their loved ones face 
a distinct set of financial challenges throughout 
their lives. Mackenzie Investments and Investors 
Group offer funds under the RDSP so clients or 
family members with disabilities can access a 
tax-preferred savings vehicle and at the same 
time, take advantage of generous government 
grants and bonds. 
A client with an RDSP can access matching funds 
of up to $70,000 from the Canada Disability 
Savings Grant. In addition, the Canada Disabili -
ty Savings Bond provides low-income Canadian 
beneficiaries a $1,000 per-year payment that is 
not matched to contributions – to a maximum of 
$20,000 per individual. 
“We heard from advisors 
that families touched by 
a disability are anxious 
to plan for a secure 
future for their affected 
family members,” said 
Carol Bezaire, Senior 
Vice-President, Tax,  
Estate and Strategic 
Philanthropy at Mackenzie. “The RDSP program, 
in conjunction with active advice and manage -
ment on the part of our advisor channels, gives 
us the opportunity to help these families in a really 
meaningful way.”

We ensure our operating companies are great 
places to work through tailored programs and  
initiatives aligned with our corporate responsibility  
priorities. Training and development contributes 
to engagement of our people and best positions 
them to serve our clients.  We also value diversity,  
as we believe having a range of perspectives and 
backgrounds improves our decision making and 
contributes to successful client relationships.
Our over 3,100 employees share common values 
and principles  –  spelled out in our Code of Conduct  
and Respectful Workplace policies. Employees 
acquire our values through training, communication 
and an annual confirmation of commitment.RESPONSIBILITIES  
Our approach to our people begins at the top:
3 The Compensation Committee of our Board  
of Directors oversees compensation policies.
3 Executive-management level human 
resource committees provide oversight on 
priorities, track performance and ensure that 
appropriate resources are allocated to deliver 
on the strategy.
3 Senior leaders responsible for human  
resource activities in our operating  
companies work together with the Senior 
Vice-President, Human Resources who  
oversees group human resource policies  
and programs.TRACKING OUR PERFORMANCE
Each company has a strong culture of engage -
ment and regularly seeks employees’ opinions, 
to understand what matters to them, how we are 
doing and how we can continuously improve. 
Using distinct approaches, each employer asks 
its people about their motivation, engagement 
and empowerment. The results make us proud.  
Along with our employee surveys, individual per -
formance reviews and regular employee forums 
help us understand if each operating company is 
achieving its employer-of-choice goal. Key survey 
results are shared with employees and influence 
our programs and initiatives.Our management

Cambridge University Students’ Union – one of only 65 companies honoured globally.  We’re proud of this

38OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY OUR ECONOMY OUR CLIENTS OUR PEOPLE  OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR COMMUNITIESMEASURING DIVERSITY
Today, our ability to measure the diversity of our workforce is limited to gender and age. To  
understand why, it’s helpful to know that IGM Financial and its operating companies are not federally 
regulated employers like many of our financial service peers in Canada.  Many of these companies are 
mandated to implement employment equity measures and collect information on their workforce under 
the Employment Equity Act.  As a result, we are not as advanced as our peers in diversity reporting and 
programming.
EMPLOYEE GENDER AND AGE DIVERSITY – 2013
We are proud of our gender diversity within our non-management and management levels. There is less 
balance at the executive level. In 2013, there were two women and 16 men on our Board of Directors. 
We are aware of the public discussion occurring globally on diversity issues. Going forward, we are  
determined to better understand the broader diversity traits of our organization – which will take time.  
We will continue to do the right thing for our business, our people and our clients.  
 
DIVERSITY OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS
We also focus on diversity among our financial advisors. The significant majority of Canada’s financial 
advisors are small business owners, each with a unique range of skills and personal connections to a 
unique community of Canadians with financial needs.
Unlike Mackenzie Investments -- which works with existing networks of third-party advisors – Investors  
Group and Investment Planning Counsel recruit, train and license proprietary networks of brand-  
affiliated financial advisors. Both companies are excited by the opportunity to work with advisors to 
serve Canada’s diverse population. BUILDING A MORE DIVERSE

As the human impact on the global environment has become better understood, responsible people and 
organiz ations are recognizing that we all must do more to reduce our individual and cumulative impacts. 
Compared to many companies, our business operations are not directly related to the use of air, 
land, water or other natural resources. But we take our shared responsibility seriously to protect the 
environment from harm. 
We believe that managing our impacts contributes to running an efficient business for our shareholders, 
empowers our employees and advisors to participate in environmental initiatives, and addresses 
client and commu nity expectations.

In 2012, the Power Financial Corporation group 
of companies – Investors Group, Mackenzie 
Investments, Investment Planning Counsel,  
Great-W est Life, London Life, Canada Life 
and Canada Life  Europe – opened a newly 
constructed, state-of-the-art data processing 
facility in Winnipeg.  Our new centre integrates 
industry best practices to limit its environmental 
footprint while maintaining stringent data security 
and availability requirements. Investors Group 
and Investment Planning Counsel operations 
were fully transitioned to the centre in 2013,  
with the Mackenzie transition to continue in 2014.  
The data centre has significant environmental 
features:
3 Outdoor air is used for cooling 200+ days/year 
and no ozone-depleting refrigerants are used.
3 Motion-sensitive lighting, zoned heating and 
cooling, and high-efficiency systems reduce 
power consumption.
3 Sophisticated building management systems 
track and manage power consumpti on.
3 Other features reduce storm water run-off 
and reduce noise levels outside the bui lding.

At IGM Financial we are committed to manag -
ing our environmental footprint responsibly. We  
impact the environment directly through our  
business operations and indirectly through our 
procurement practices and our product and  
service offerings.  We believe that incorporating 
environmental considerations into our business  
decisions makes our business stronger and  
contributes to overall environmental sustainability.  
We are currently focused on managing the direct 
impacts from our operations – primarily energy  
use and business travel, which are the main  
drivers of our greenhouse gas emissions. We 
are also looking for ways to improve on waste  
management and paper use.   
Key to our success is promoting employee aware -
ness and knowledge of environmental sustainability  
issues, and engaging our employees in man -
aging our collective impacts. We will be looking  
for ways to further engage our people, including  
the establishment and communication of an  
Environmental Policy in 2014.RESPONSIBILITIES  
3  Operating committees of executive manage -
ment direct the creation, implementation 
and evaluation of environmental initiatives 
within each of our operating companies.
3  The Enterprise Risk Management depart -

reporting on the Company’s risks, including 
risks and opportunities associated with envi -
ronmental issues, and reports those to IGM 
Financial’s Risk Management Committee.
3  Our Environmental Committee provides  
focus and prioritization on environmental 
and sustainability issues across our  
operating companies.TRACKING OUR PERFORMANCE
In 2013 we reported for the first time to the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) on our energy use and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performance, 
responding to investor requests to participate in 
the survey. IGM Financial ranked among the top 
reporting companies in Canada’s financial industry 
in the survey.  Our disclosure score of 84 was above 
the financial industry average of 74; however, our 
performance score of C was about median.  We know 
we can improve and are looking for opportunities  
to do so.  
We will continue to track our ongoing performance 
and plan for continuous improvement. In 2014, 
the Environmental Committee began to work with 
business units at the operating companies to develop 
action plans and ensure those plans are effective in 
driving our environmental performance.  
We have also set GHG emission reduction targets 
and made those public in our 2014 CDP submission. 
We have set targets in areas where we have a good 
degree of control: energy consumption from owned 
facilities and business travel.  We will continue to look 
for ways to better measure and manage the impacts 
from leased premises.Our management

43ENERGY CONSUMPTION
We began collecting and analyzing energy  
consumption data for our Canadian operations in 
2013, to respond to the CDP survey. Consumption  
of electricity and natural gas at our owned and 
leased properties is the primary driver of energy use.  
Like many companies, we have challenges in 
measuring and managing our consumption:
3  Our ability to accurately track energy use 
is limited – about 40% of our owned and 
leased buildings have separate utility  
meters, while the remainder of energy  
use is estimated.
3  Our ability to directly manage consumption 
in shared leased premises is more difficult –  
about 80% of our total square footage is  
in leased premises, many of which are  
large multi-tenant buildings.100%

3  Transitioning the majority of our computer 
systems to the new energy-efficient Winnipeg 
Data Centre, saving two tonnes of green -
house gases each year.  The centre is located 
in Manitoba, a very low-carbon emission 
electricity province.
3  Reduction in electricity consumption of 2.5% 
across our operating companies as a result 
of building upgrades and space consolida -
tion was offset by a 7.8% increase in natu -
ral gas consumption due to the cold winter.  
This resulted in a 0.7% increase in overall 
electricity and natural gas usage across our 
Canadian operations.
Over the next few years we plan to seek 
opportunities to upgrade our owned and leased 
properties, where possible, and optimize office 
occupancy to achieve efficiency across the 
organization. Investors Group will complete an 
energy audit of its head office in 2014 and plans 
to seek the BOMA BESt building certification.     HIGHLIGHTS FROM 2013 INCLUDE:

According to the National Inventory Report,1 64% of Canada’s electricity is generated by renewable hydro 
and other power sources. In Manitoba, where the IGM Financial and Investors Group head office and the 
Winnipeg Data Centre are located, about 99% of electricity is produced GHG-free at hydroelectric gener -
ating plants that do not burn fossil fuels.
We continue to work to reduce our consumption of electricity, recognizing that all generation and  
transmission of electrical power has environmental impacts.
TRAVEL 
Travel is a necessary part of our business. We are a global financial services company with offices in most 
major Canadian centres and international offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dublin.  
We encourage our employees to consider their travel requirements carefully and we have extended  
the use of video conferencing facilities to reduce the environmental impact of travel.  We also have a 
preferred hotel program that only partners with sustainably responsible hotels.
We offer on-line training for financial advisors to reduce travel needs. We use sustainably managed 
hotels and conference facilities, and in 2013, Investors Group implemented a mobile tool for its annual 
Apex Summit to allow conference delegates to access materials on line and reduce the need for printing.
WASTE AND RECYCLING
We donate used office and computer equipment to charities, and where donations are not possible, we 
partner with our supplier to achieve landfill-avoidance for electronic equipment we no longer use.  We also 
engage our employees in helping us with recycling and waste management efforts.

In 2013, we collected data to measure our 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to address 
investor requests to participate in our first CDP 
survey. Though responsible energy use and  
expense management has always been part of our 
culture, through the CDP process we increased our 
awareness of  the different impacts of our opera -
tions across Canada and the drivers of our emissions. 
In 2013, our travel and natural gas emissions 
increased, but were offset by a decline in electric -
ity emissions.  Overall, our emissions increased 
3.3% in 2013 when compared to the prior year.
We have set GHG emission reduction targets  
using 2013 as our base year:
3  1% reduction in absolute GHG emissions 
from energy used in owned assets by 2018
3  2.5%  reduction in  GHG emissions intensity 
per employee from business travel by 2018

REDUCING OUR PAPER USE
We are committed to reducing paper use and will be measuring our consumption in 2014 to establish a 
baseline for future improvements.  We will seek additional opportunities to reduce paper used for client 
statements and reporting, financial advisor reporting and marketing, office work, and other business 
operations.  We will also look to increase the use of recycled paper and paper from sustainably managed 
forests and ways to improve waste and recycling programs.  Some 2013 highlights include:  
3  Selection of new office paper vendors continues our commitment to use paper from responsibly  
managed forests.
3  Elimination of 1.7 million sheets, or 7.7 tonnes of paper a year, by replacing the Investors Group  
Consultant’s copy of a client transaction with an electronic copy.
3  Electronic offering of nearly 900 Investors Group marketing pieces through the launch of a new online 
tool for advisors.

Our operating companies’ major corporate offices  
are located in larg e urban centres where public  
transit is a viable alternative to private transportation  
for our employees. We financially support our  
employees in their choice to use greener public 
commuting options. We e stimate that the use of 
public transit by our employees in 2013 saved ap -
proximately 717 tonnes of greenhouse gas emis -
sions compared to employees driving their vehicles 
to work every day.
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
Our employees regularly propose energy saving and 
waste reduction ideas. Employees have an oppor -
tunity at employee forums to raise suggestions on 
ways we can reduce our environmental impacts. 
Our people are encouraged by the property  
managers for our leased premises to engage in simple  and effective energy saving activities, such as  
closing window blinds on hot, sunny, days to reduce 
the need for air conditioning.  
We recognize that employee engagement is key 
to our success in managing our environmental  
impacts and we will look for additional ways to tap 
into their creativity in 2014 and beyond.

Investors Group is extending its social-change partnership with international charity and  
education partner Free The Children, whose innovative work:
3  Starts at home, giving young Canadians confidence and support to make a difference in 
their own communities.
3  Moves overseas, helping communities improve education and break free from poverty.
3  Results in tangible change, improving the lives of children and families in selected overseas 
communities and empowering Canadian youth to recognize they can change the world.
The partnership recognizes that youth eager for social change have difficulty identifying how to 
have the greatest impact, and where to begin.  It includes:
1. Social innovation speaking tour  – The “Me to We” tour touches the lives of students at  
50 Canadian schools annually.  It inspires youth to look past their own lives and find ways to 
improve the situation of youth overseas.
2. Take Action Camp  – Me to We hosts a camp that empowers youth to pursue the causes 
they care about and create a groundswell of change in their communities.
3. Social Innovation Youth Contest – Free The Children chooses 5-10 of the most promising 
socially innovative business ideas and contributes funding.

Investors Group Employees in Action (EIA)

Community service enriches the quality of life

HELP FOR THOSE WHO HELP  
Volunteers give so much.  Sadly, that doesn’t 
often impress decision-makers when a volunteer 
applies for a paying job or to get into post-sec -
ondary education.  Letters of reference from 
charities are rare and often don’t use language, 
or a format, that recruiters find persuasive.  
Investors Group is partnering with Volunteer 
Canada and le Centre d’action bénévole de 
Québec (CABQ) to change that.  Together, they’re 
updating a CABQ volunteer-recognition program, 
training those who manage volunteers to create 
professional certificates that recognize volun -
teers’ skills and experiences in language that 
influences recruiters.
Volunteers do so much and ask so little. Through 
this program, we can help Canada’s volunteers 
better advance their careers.
HELPING HANDS AWAY FROM HOME 
Attendees o f Investors Group’s 2013 President Circle conference were universally moved by an initiative that saw  
them step away from their meeting rooms to roll up their sleeves and spend the day giving back.
At the event in Lausanne, Switzerland, the company’s Consultants prepared 75,000 food packages destined for  
Moldova and Romania and 100 water filtration systems for Ugandan families.

When Investment Planning Counsel employees 
and Spirit Committee members volunteer at Peel 
Region (Ontario) Salvation Army shelter for families  
in crisis, they do whatever it takes. For three years, 
employees have supplied specific families with 
clothing, toys and toiletries; they sponsor day care 
at the shelter, so parents can acquire work skills; 
and they provide bedding and kitchenware, to help 
families re-establish themselves outside the shelter. 
Investment Planning Counsel employees begin by
