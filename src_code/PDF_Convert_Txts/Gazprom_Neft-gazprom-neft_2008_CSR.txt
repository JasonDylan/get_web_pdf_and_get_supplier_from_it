Sustainability	 Overview	 was	prepared	 during	the	period	of	global	turbulent	 economic	 and	financial	 environment,	 which	
dramatically	 affected	the	Russian	 business.	 However,	 I	am	convinced	 that	the	crisis	is	a	temporary	 occurrence.	 We	keep	our	
mind	on	a	long-term	development	and	have	all	necessary	conditions	for	efficient	growth	and	sustainable	development.	Gazprom	 Neft’s	ambitious	 goal	is	to	become	one	of	the	major	international	 market	participants.	 It	can’t	be	reached	 without	
a	strong	professional	 team	able	to	effectively	 solve	the	ambitious	 tasks	of	the	Company.	 In	recent	years,	we	have	done	a	lot	
to	build	a	new	HR	management	system	and	a	transparent	system	of	compensation	policy	and	career	development.Working	 on	efficiency	 ,	we	pay	close	attention	 to	the	social	responsibility	 of	our	business.	 Basic	programs	 are	focused	on	the	
development	 of	an	integrated	 control	system	in	environment	 protection	 and	industrial	 safety	field,	support	of	professional	
and	amateur	 sports,	support	of	indigenous	 small	ethnic	communities	 of	the	North.	The	key	element	 of	social	responsibility	
in	the	regions	of	the	Company’s	activities	is	a	constructive	cooperation	with	authorities.	I	hope	the	Overview	 will	help	to	summarize	 key	results	and	set	out	our	further	steps	towards	 improving	 of	the	Company’s	
stability	in	current	difficult	conditions.	I	am	sure	that	Gazprom	Neft’s	business	is	in	safe	hands	of	a	professional	team.

3OVERVIEW	OF	SUSTAINABLE	DEVELOPMENT
JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009DEVELOPMENT IN 2007–2009:THE COMPANY
2007 had to be crucial, stabilize oil production, determine the business strategy, goals 
and objectives, an efficient system of management. The year was indicative indeed, as the expansion of the resource base started; a number of large projects in oil production, refining and sales were launched. Some new managerial tools started being developed; the Company’s own corporate culture started being formed.
2008 confirmed the Company’s ambitions to become the best performing leader in all business 
lines of the industry, to begin expansion to foreign markets. Implementation of strategic 
initiatives and projects, in particular the purchase of 50% in Tomskneft and 51% in NIS (Serbia), 
helped us to lay down the foundation for future growth and stability.
In 2009 the Company’s strategy remained the same: business growth. The Company’s 
performance indicators after the 1st quarter are the best among major Russian oil industry 
participants. In order to remain a leader, the Company shall implement strategic initiatives aiming to increase efficiency of business processes, resources and production facilities used.2007

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009ABOUT
THE OVERVIEW 
Sustainable	 development	 and	openness	 to	dialogue	 are	those	values	the	adherence	 to	which	is	being	tested	today	at	many	
companies.	 The	economic	 instability	 rapidly	identifies	 ineffective	 corporate	 practices	 and	principles.	 And,	quite	the	contrary,	
dictates	a	demand	for	what	may	become	a	real	guideline	 in	the	global	crisis	for	the	staff,	partners	 and	customers.	 In	line	with	
its	traditional	 sustainable	 development	 report,	Gazprom	 Neft	confirmed	 its	readiness	 to	follow	its	leadership	 strategy.	 Gazprom 	
Neft	does	not	renounce	its	obligations.
It	would	be	difficult	to	show	the	Company’s 	continuous 	efforts	to	achieve	its	strategic 	goals	within	the	framework 	of	an	annual	
report.	The	impact	of	the	global	economic	 crisis	on	some	of	the	Company’s	 indicators	 may	be	misinterpreted	 as	an	adjustment 	
of	corporate	 priorities.	 The	2007–2009	 overview,	 on	the	reverse,	 allows	to	evaluate	 the	consistency	 in	moving	toward	the	
corporate	 goals,	such	as	effective	 business,	 international	 reputation,	 staff	social	security,	 and	safe	production	 shown	by	the	
Company	 in	different	 time	periods.	This	movement	 had	different	 speed	at	different	 stages	of	the	way,	subject	to	macroeconomic 	
environment,	 oil	market	conditions,	 efficiency	 of	the	Gazprom	 Neft	staff.	The	nearest	future	puts	some	serious	challenges 	
before	the	Company;	 however,	 the	adherence	 to	sustainable	 development	 shown	in	figures	and	results	guarantees	 that		
the	team	of	Gazprom	Neft	will	be	able	to	overcome	all	difficulties	and	turn	them	into	new	opportunities.
The	objectives 	set	by	the	Company 	as	far	back	as	in	2007	and	included	into	its	medium-term 	strategy	for	2008–2010 	remain	
significant.	 Environmental,	 social,	educational	 programs,	 often	worked	out	for	more	than	just	one	year,	will	mostly	continue	
ensuring 	successive 	and	sustainable 	development 	of	the	Company. 	Gazprom 	Neft	continues 	its	strong	investment 	activities	
started	in	2007	and	2008.	Making	itself	a	global	company,	 Gazprom	 Neft	will	continue	 purchasing	 foreign	assets	in	addition		
to	its	purchases	of	2008–2009	(Tomskneft,	Serbian	oil	company	NIS,	and	an	Italian	oil	and	lubricant	producer).
The	Company	 holds	firmly	to	the	vector	of	improvements	 and	reorganizations	 in	all	directions	 set	by	the	Overview:	 management 	
of	sustainable 	development, 	economic 	activities, 	HR	policy,	regional	social	activity,	cooperation 	with	suppliers 	and	consumers,	
environmental	policy	and	industrial	safety.Furthermore,	 the	crisis	provides	 a	unique	opportunity	 to	reduce	expenses,	 increase	 efficiency	 and	improve	 performance. 	
Gazprom 	Neft	possesses 	all	resources 	available 	to	develop	and	realize	its	leadership 	ambitions 	and	overcome 	the	crisis	with	
even	a	more	distinct	outlook	of	sustainable	development.MANAGEMENT

OF RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT
THE ROLE OF MANAGERS IN THE RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT
In	2007–2008,	 Gazprom	 Neft	formed	its	new	top	management	 team,	which	turned	to	be	the	youngest	 among	Russian	 oil	
companies.	 Ambitious	 promising	 managers	 having	gained	a	successful	 experience	 with	leading	Russian	 and	international	
business	 structures	 joined	the	Company,	 and	under	their	guidance	 Gazprom	 Neft	became	 one	of	the	fastest-growing	
market	participants.	 In	2007	and	2008,	Gazprom	 Neft	showed	the	best	net	specific	profit	results	among	Russia’s	 top-five	oil	
companies.	 Despite	the	global	economic	 crisis,	the	results	of	2008	were	the	best	in	the	Company’s	 history	in	terms	of	profit	
and	EBITDA,	 according	 to	US	GAAP.	Q1	2009	confirmed	 the	competences	 of	Gazprom	 Neft	leaders;	 the	Company’s	 financial	
and	economic	results	are	the	best	in	the	industry.
The	efficiency-oriented	 Gazprom	 Neft	top	management	 team	attaches	 great	importance	 to	the	implementation	 of	sustainable	
development	 principles	 and	practices	 throughout	 the	Company,	 including	 subsidiaries.	 Gazprom	 Neft’s	strategic	 goal	is	to	
become	a	leader	among	the	world’s	oil	&	gas	companies	 in	terms	of	sustainable	 development.	 Such	issues	as	staff	support,	
environment,	and	relations	with	regions	are	closely	connected	with	production	&	economic	priorities.
KEY CODES AND POLICIES
Since	2007	Gazprom	 Neft	has	adopted	a	number	of	Policies	and	Codes	determining	 the	Company’s	 adherence	 to	sustainable	
development.	 For	example,	 in	2007-2008,	 the	following	 Policies	were	adopted:	 Charity	Policy,	Project	Management	 Policy,	
Management	 Documentation	 Policy,	Information	 Security	 Policy,	Strategic	 Planning	 Policy,	Risk	Management	 Policy,	IT	
Policy,	Industrial	 Safety,	Labor	Protection	 and	Environment	 Protection	 Policy,	the	Corporate	 Code.	In	turn,	on	the	base	of	
these	a	number	 of	standards	 and	projects	 have	been	worked	out,	which	directly	contribute	 to	the	Company’s	 sustainable	
development.	 In	2009	the	Company	 will	keep	on	implementing	 new	documents,	 for	example	 in	the	field	of	corporate	 ethics	
and	risk	management..MANAGEMENT

RISK  
MANAGEMENT
Risk	identification,	 analysis	 and	management	 are	important	 components	 of	Gazprom	 Neft	
sustainable	 development.	 Therefore,	 every	employee	 needs	to	understand	 the	Company’s	
risk	management	 approach.	 In	order	to	increase	 the	Company’s	 performance	 by	means	
of	a	systematic	 risk	approach,	 in	November	 2008,	Gazprom	 Neft	adopted	 the	Risk	
Management	 Policy.	The	Company’s	 goal	in	terms	of	risk	management	 is	to	ensure	that	
additional	 guarantees	 of	strategic	 goals	are	achieved	 through	early	prevention/identification	 	
and	management	of	risks.
Financial	 risks	are	covered	by	the	terms	of	reference	 of	the	financial	 risk	management	
committee	 established	 in	2008.	Its	functions	 include	risk	identification,	 developing	 a	
set	of	comprehensive	 management	 measures	 and	controlling	 their	realization,	 which	
allows	reduction	 of	potential	 losses	caused	by	risk	realization	 and	supports	 the	Company	 	
in	achieving	 its	financial	 management	 goals	and	objectives.	 Non-financial	 risks	are	
distributed	 among	all	directions	 of	the	corporate	 activity.	Gazprom	 Neft	has	established	 an	
obligatory	 risk-oriented	 approach	 to	be	applied	by	any	employee	 in	any	activity	and	on	any	level		
of	the	Company.
Gazprom	Neft’s	board	regularly	monitors	the	Company’s	key	risks.	The	Integrated	 Risk	Management	 System	(IRMS)	developed	 and	implemented	 at	the	
Corporate	 Center	in	2008	is	Gazprom	 Neft’s	key	risk	management	 tool.	This	approach	
ensures	 transparency	 and	availability	 of	risk-related	 information,	 enabling	 to	determine	
timely	a	response	 strategy,	 to	develop	risk	management	 measures,	 and	to	monitor	 their	
effectiveness.	The	IRMS	standard	will	be	approved	in	2009.The	first	step	to	implement	 the	IRMS	in	the	corporate	 practice	 was	the	creation	 in	the	
beginning	 of	2008	of	a	register	of	key	risks	and	risk	factors	on	the	basis	of	interviews	 with	
heads	of	the	Company’	departments	and	top	managers.The	next	step	involved	drawing	 up	of	‘risk	cards’	containing	 all	information	 about	the	risk,	
its	assessment	 and	management	 measures.	 In	order	to	finalize	the	register	of	key	risks,	
the	IRMS	is	being	implemented	 on	the	level	of	blocks	and	independent	 business	 units	
of	the	Corporate	 Center.	In	2008	42	employees	 of	blocks	and	directly	subordinated	 units	
completed	risk	management	training.The	next	stage	in	the	Company’s	 risk	management	 development	 is	IRMS	implementation	
at	subsidiaries	 and	affiliates	 in	2009–2010.	 In	2008	a	pilot	project	of	IRMS	deployment	 was	
launched	 at	the	Omsk	Oil	Refinery.	 As	a	result,	IRMS	will	become	 an	integral	part	of	the	
Company’s	corporate	management	system.RISKS

Additional	sustainability	of	Gazprom	Neft	is	based	on	the	knowledge	and	consideration	of	the	interested	parties’.
In	order	to	make	decisions	 with	ultimate	 awareness	 (both	own	and	that	of	the	interested	 parties),	 Gazprom	 Neft	gets	
regular	feedback	 from	shareholders,	 investors,	 staff,	government,	 public	organizations	 and	individuals.	 So,	in	2007–
2009,	the	Company	 polled	its	employees	 to	evaluate	 the	social	and	psychological	 climate	 in	teams,	and	participated 	
in	specialized	 business,	 scientific	 and	practical	 conferences;	 the	Company’s	 management	 held	regular	meetings	 with	
investors 	and	shareholders; 	expanded 	meetings 	attended 	by	heads	of	all	subsidiaries 	and	affiliates, 	as	well	as	labor	
union	representatives	were	held	twice	a	year.News	about	the	Company’s	 events	and	position	 in	the	market	were	regularly	 reported	 on	Gazprom	 Neft	website	 and	
in	corporate	 media:	Sibirskaya	 Neft	magazine,	 newspapers	 Neftegazeta	 (founded	 in	2008),	Sibirskiy	 Neftyanik,	 Slovo	
Neftyanika,	 Nashe	Delo,	and	Muravlenkovskie	 Novosti.	 The	Company’s	 informational	 field	was	supported	 with	press	
releases,	 managers’	 interviews,	 booklets,	 publications	 in	the	federal	and	regional	 press.	Many	issues	are	included 		
in	Gazprom	Neft	annual	report.
PROVIDING THE INTERESTED PARTIES WITH INFORMATION ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT
One	of	the	Company’s	 most	important	 channels	 of	communication	 with	the	interested	 parties	is	its	sustainable 	
development 	report.	It	is	addressed 	not	only	to	investors 	and	shareholders, 	but	also	employees, 	regional	authorities,	
public	organizations	 –	that	is,	every	person	who	needs	additional	 knowledge	 about	the	Company	 and	its	operating 	
principals	and	results.
Gazprom	 Neft	was	created	on	the	base	of	a	fixed	asset,	Sibneft	company,	 purchased	 by	Gazprom	 Group	in	2006.	There	
had	been	two	reports	on	social	development	 issued	by	Sibneft.	 Gazprom	 Neft	considered	 its	predecessor’s	 experience 	
and	in	2007	issued	an	overview	 of	corporate	 social	programs	 Gazprom	 Neft:	Social	Horizons.	 However,	 beginning	 with		MANAGEMENT

its	first	sustainable	 development	 report,	the	Company	 chose	to	adhere	to	world	
standards.	 At	the	end	of	2007,	it	was	decided	 to	arrange	 a	system	of	collecting 	
information	 for	the	report	based	on	G3	guide’s	requirements	 and	IPIECA/API	 guidelines 	
on	voluntary	sustainable	development	reporting	for	oil	&	gas	companies.
Gazprom	 Neft	Sustainable	 Development	 Report	2007	published	 in	2008	evidenced	 the	
expansion	 of	the	Company’s	 communication	 with	the	interested	 parties.	It	was	for	the	
first	time	that	the	document	 disclosed	 a	great	deal	of	data	relating	 to	HR,	environment 	
and	labor	protection.	 Gazprom	 Neft	Sustainable	 Development	 Report	2007	is	entered	
into	the	National	 register	 of	non-financial	 corporate	 reports	 of	the	Russian	 Union		
of	Industrialists	and	Entrepreneurs.
In	order	to	ensure	high	quality	and	usefulness 	of	the	report	for	the	interested 	parties	
and	for	the	Company	 itself,	Gazprom	 Neft	made	presentations	 of	a	draft	report	at	the	
meetings	 with	a	wide	group	of	interested	 parties	in	Omsk,	and	social	report	experts	
in	Moscow.A	round	table	held	in	Omsk	in	April	2008	brought	together 	the	management 	of	Gazprom	
Neft	and	the	Omsk	Refinery,	 representatives	 of	state	authorities,	 representatives 		
of	the	local	community,	 public	organizations	 and	mass	media.	The	document 	
received	 a	positive	 feedback	 enriched	 with	comments	 and	constructive	 proposals. 		
The	participants 	of	the	round	table	noted	that	the	fact	of	such	a	report	being	prepared	
and	published	evidences	the	Company’s	openness.
Further	 to	public	and	expert	discussions	 on	the	report,	corporate	 social	report	
(CSR)	experts	coming	from	companies, 	rating	agencies, 	environmental 	and	research	
organizations	 and	universities	 met	in	Moscow	 on	May	14,	2008.	The	report	was	
commented	 by	16	independent	 experts.	 Among	other	things	it	was	suggested	 that	
even	more	information	 in	respect	of	international	 and	national	 initiatives	 the	Company 	
was	going	to	join	should	be	added;	besides,	 the	report	should	be	more	focused		
on	non-financial	risks.
The	received 	notes	and	suggestions 	made	it	possible 	to	improve	considerably	 	
the	quality	of	the	Company’s	sustainable	development	report.

STRATEGY
In	2007–2009,	 Gazprom	 Neft	kept	on	developing	 its	traditional	 activities	 in	Russia	and	abroad,	 including	 oil	and	gas	
production,	 oil	processing,	 wholesale	 and	retail	of	oil	and	oil	products,	 including	 special	products	 (aviation	 fuel,	marine	
diesel,	lubricants),	 as	well	as	rendering	 special	services	 in	oil	and	gas	production,	 including	 geological	 survey,	drilling,	
and	wells	and	pipelines	 construction	 and	maintenance.	 All	of	the	Company’s	 projects	 and	initiatives	 were	in	line	with		
the	Gazprom	 Neft’s	goals	of	development	 by	2020	in	accordance	 with	the	long-term	 strategy	 adopted	 in	2007.	By	2020,		
the	company	shall	achieve:
• volume of prospected extracted hydrocarbon resources: about 2200–2400 mn t;
• volume of oil production: about 90–100  mn t;
• volume of internal processing: about 70–80 mn t;
• retail network: about 5000–5500 gas stations;
• premium oil products sales: about 40 mn t.
While	achieving	 its	goals	in	2007–2009,	 Gazprom	 Neft	considerably	 expanded	 its	presence	 in	Russian	 oil	and	gas	industry,	
including	 purchase	 of	new	assets.	At	the	end	of	2007,	the	Company	 purchased	 50%	of	shares	in	Tomskneft	 and	entered	into	
an	agreement	 with	the	holder	of	another	 half	of	the	company’s	 shares,	Rosneft.	 In	the	beginning	 of	2008,	Gazprom	 Neft	
entered	into	an	agreement	on	shared	management	of	the	Moscow	oil	Refinery	with	its	other	shareholders.	
Naturally,	 the	global	drop	of	oil	prices	from	USD	85	per	bbl	early	in	2008	and	USD	140	per	bbl	in	the	middle	of	2008	down		
to	USD	35	in	January	2009	affected	Gazprom	 Neft’s	business	 and	corporate	 initiatives.	 However,	 balanced	 investment	 policy,	
low	amount	of	borrowed	 loans	and	accumulation	 of	own	financial	 reserves	 enables	 the	Company	 to	meet	its	obligations	 	
in	full,	and	to	stabilize	its	position	in	Russian	and	international	markets.In	February	 2009,	Gazprom	 Neft	completed	 the	purchase	 of	51%	of	shares	of	the	Serbian	company	 NIS,	one	of	the	leaders	
of	Central	and	Eastern	European	 oil	and	gas	sector	with	average	 annual	oil	production	 of	1	mn	t	and	processing	 capacity	
of	7.3	mn	t.	Through	 the	acquired	 Serbian	company	 NIS,	Gazprom	 Neft	will	be	able	to	enter	not	only	the	Serbian	market,	
but	also	other	European	 markets.	 With	NIS,	marketing	 and	production	 synergy	 of	another	 new	asset	of	the	Company	 	
is	expected,	 namely	that	of	an	oil	and	lubricant	 producer	 in	Bari	(Italy)	purchased	 in	April	2009	from	Chevron	 Global	Energy.	
The	plant’s	annual	capacity	 amounts	 to	30	Kt	of	oils	and	6	Kt	of	lubricants.	 All	products	 manufactured	 by	the	plant	meet	
European	 quality	standards.	 Gazprom	 Neft’s	strategic	 goals	remained	 the	same;	however,	 its	medium-term	 objectives	 were	
re-adjusted	 subject	to	the	crisis	management,	 which	enables	the	Company	 to	achieve	its	preset	quantitative	 and	qualitative	
indicators	without	any	substantial	change.ECONOMIC

2007–2008	 were	the	best	years	in	the	history	of	the	Company’s	 economy.	 In	2008	EBITDA	increase	 was	equal	to	28%	(10%	
in	2007),	net	profit	increased	 by	12.5%	(13.2%	in	2007).	Because	 of	the	collapse	 of	world	oil	prices	in	Q4	2008	the	profit	
of	the	Company,	 like	that	of	other	Russian	 oil	companies,	 decreased	 dramatically;	 however,	 due	to	activity	and	structure	
optimization	measures,	we	were	able	to	reverse	the	situation	as	early	as	in	Q1	2009.
Among	positive	factors	for	the	oil	industry	 was	the	reduction	 of	tax	burden	authorized	 by	the	Russian	 Government	 in	2008,	
including	 reduction	 of	export	duty,	mining	tax,	zero	duty	on	imported	 unique	equipment.	 Gazprom	 Neft	took	an	active	part	
in	the	dialogue	 between	 oil	companies	 and	the	Government.	 In	the	new	economic	 conditions	 the	Company	 justified	 the	
reasonability	 of	tax	burden	reduction	 based	on	its	own	activity	taken	as	an	example.	 In	the	issue	of	oil	industry	 support	
measures	 to	be	taken	in	2009	Gazprom	 Neft	will	receive	additional	 profit	of	about	RUR	10	bn,	which	will	partially	 be	invested	
in	the	production	and	processing,	as	well	as	applied	to	compensation	of	natural	monopolies’	rate	growth.Gazprom	 Neft	makes	a	considerable	 contribution	 into	development	 of	the	Russian	 economy.	 In	2007–2009,	 the	Company	
traditionally	 invested	 its	profit	in	the	support	and	development	 of	sustainable	 production	 activity,	efficient	 use	of	oil	and	gas	
resources,	creation	of	new	jobs	and	wage	payment	to	employees.The	created	value	was	also	allocated	 into	dividend	 payments	 to	shareholders,	 federal	and	regional	 taxes,	financing	 of	social	
and	economic	partnership	programs	and	charitable	projects	in	the	regions.The	achieved	 economic	 results	make	Gazprom	 Neft	one	of	Russia’s	 major	taxpayers.	 In	2008	total	amount	of	taxes	(other	
than	income	tax)	paid	by	the	Company	 reached	 USD	5.237	bn,	which	is	by	52.6%	more	than	in	2007.	In	addition,	 profit	tax	
amounted	 to	USD	1.730	bn,	which	is	by	47.6%	more	than	in	2007.	Export	duties	paid	by	Gazprom	 Neft	in	2008	grew	by	64.6%,	
up	to	USD	7.217	bn.	The	Company	 considers	 timely	assessments	 to	all	levels	of	budgets	 as	a	part	of	its	social	responsibility	
and	a	ground	for	the	development	of	its	social	projects.19OVERVIEW	OF	SUSTAINABLE	DEVELOPMENT

OIL PRODUCTION
Gazprom	 Neft’	production	 facilities	 are	located	in	major	Russian	 oil	and	gas	areas:	
KMAA,	YNAA,	Chukotka	 Autonomous	 Region,	Omsk	and	Tomsk	regions.	 In	2007–2008,	
Gazpromneft-	Noyabrskneftegaz	remained	Gazprom	Neft’s	key	oil	producing	unit.	
The	Company	 managed	 to	increase	 the	oil	production	 general	indicators	 by	5,6%	in	2008.	
LLC	Gazpromneft-Khantos	 remained	 a	leader	among	JSC	Gazprom	 Neft	business	 units	
in	terms	of	production	 growth	in	2007	and	2008	(+12.7%	in	2008).	However,	 the	purchase	
of	Tomskneft	 added	up	the	largest	contribution	 in	production	 volumes	 growth.	At	most	
enterprises,	 though,	 due	to	depletion	 of	many	fields	the	production	 figures	kept	on	
dropping:	 in	2008,	aggregate	 decrease	 in	the	oil	production	 of	subsidiaries	 and	affiliates	
amounted	 to	6%.	Moreover,	 the	world	crisis	caused	a	significant	 cut	of	the	investment	
program	 of	field	support	in	2008–2009,	 and	affected	oil	production	 volumes	 in	most	units.	
As	pre-estimated,	 investments	 in	production	 as	compared	 to	2008	will	fall	in	2009	by	25–
30%.	However,	 priority	units	will	accelerate	 their	operations.	 Thus,	Gazpromneft-Khantos	
will	increase	drilling	rates	by	8%	in	2009.Gazprom	 Neft	keeps	a	fundamental	 safety	margin	due	to	the	fact	that	since	2007	the	
Company	 has	been	focusing	 on	provision	 of	oil	reserves.	 As	a	result,	by	the	beginning	 of	
2009,	the	Company’s	 proven	oil	reserves	 amounted	 to	4.5	bn	bbl.	This	puts	Gazprom	 Neft	
among	the	world’s	twenty	largest	oil	companies.	 From	2007	to	2008,	gas	reserves	 grew	
by	195.7%	up	to	2154	bn	ft3.20OVERVIEW	OF	SUSTAINABLE	DEVELOPMENT
JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009The	Company	 considers	 complicated	 circumstances	 as	a	challenge	 and	an	inducement	 to	work	more	efficiently.	 In	2009	the	
largest	amounts	 (about	70%)	will	be	invested	 by	the	Company	 in	exploration	 and	production.	 Gazprom	 fields	in	the	north		
of	Yamal	peninsula,	 which	will	be	developed	 by	Gazprom	 Neft	together	 with	the	gas	corporation,	 bear	a	foremost	 potential.	
Oil	reserves	 extracted	 there	amount	to	about	400	mn	tons,	that	is,	at	the	peak,	will	enable	the	Company	 to	achieve	an	annual	
production	 of	15	to	20	mn	tons,	which	makes	almost	half	of	the	current	Gazprom	 Neft	production.	 In	2009	Gazprom	 Neft	
intends	to	prepare	a	feasibility	study	on	these	fields	development.
Gazprom	 Neft	is	studying	 production	 opportunities	 in	plenty	of	the	world	regions.	 For	example,	 advantages	 of	Central	Asia	
include	a	mentality	 similar	to	the	Russian	 one,	experience	 and	similar	geological	 conditions.	 Operations	 are	also	possible	
on	continental	 shelves	of	the	West	and	North	Africa	(Libya,	Algeria),	 where	Gazprom	 plans	to	launch	some	of	its	projects.	
Gazprom	 Neft	is	a	member	 of	the	Russian	 Consortium	 for	Heavy	Oil	Fields	Development	 in	Venezuela,	 and	became	the	first	
Russian	 company	 qualified	 for	operations	 in	Cuba.	Gazprom	 Neft	will	keep	on	its	performance	 in	those	regions	in	line	with	
expanding	into	the	Middle	East	(Iran,	Iraq).
OIL PROCESSING
The	success	 of	Gazprom	 Neft	in	the	oil	products	 processing	 was	achieved	 due	to	high	level	of	technologies	 used	in	the	
Company’s	 units,	as	well	as	their	advantageous	 geographical	 location.	 During	the	last	three	years,	the	Company	 has	
always	been	among	the	first	companies	 in	Russia	in	terms	of	production	 growth	rates	due	to	such	assets	as	JSC	Slavneft-
Yaroslavlnefteorgsintez,	 JSC	Moscow	 Oil	Refinery	 and	JSC	Gazpromneft-Omsk	 Oil	Refinery.	 JSC	Gazpromneft-ONPZ	 	
is	the	largest	processing	 unit	of	the	Company.	 In	2007–2008,	 the	Omsk	Refinery	 showed	strong	growth	as	compared	 to	2006,	
having	increased	 oil	processing	 by	12.9%	(from	16.3	to	18.4	mn	tons).	In	2007-2009,	 the	refinery	remained	 a	leader	in	terms	
of	production	volumes	of	light	oil	products	and	aromatic	hydrocarbons	among	Russian	oil	companies.Within	the	last	few	years	the	Company’s	 general	trend	included	 production	 of	environmentally	 friendly	products,	 enabling	
to	enter	absolutely	 new	markets.	 So,	the	Omsk	Refinery	 development	 plan	provides	 for	a	changeover	 for	Euro	4	standard	
gasoline	 and	diesel	fuel	production	 starting	from	2012,	and	after	2015	for	Euro	5	standard.	 For	these	purposes,	 in	2008,	
the	L-24/9	diesel	fuel	installation	 was	reconstructed;	 in	2008–2009,	 two	hydrorefining	 installations	 are	being	designed	 (for	
diesel	fuel	and	catalytic	 cracking	 gasoline);	 and	in	January	 2008,	construction	 of	Izomalk-2	 (an	isomerization	 plant)	began.	
The	isomerization	 plant	in	Omsk	will	be	the	largest	in	Russia	with	annual	rated	input	capacity	 of	800	Kt.	Its	construction	
is	to	be	completed	 in	2010.	The	new	complex	 along	with	a	gasoline	 hydrorefining	 unit	will	enable	to	increase	 the	volume		
of	automobile	gasoline	products	and	achieve		Euro	4	standard	quality.Construction	 of	the	isomerization	 plant	is	the	first	stage	of	the	medium-term	 investment	 program	 of	environmentally	
friendly	fuels	production.

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009An	isomerization	 plant	similar	to	that	in	Omsk	is	planned	for	construction	 at	JSC	Slavneft-
Yaroslavnefteorgsintez	 (YaNOS)	 as	well.	YaNOS	was	one	of	few	plants	to	quickly	organize	
production	 of	low-sulfur	 diesel	fuels.	So,	in	2008,	the	production	 of	diesel	fuel	with	10	
mg/kg	sulfur	content	(standard	 5	requirements)	 was	about	55%	of	the	total	production	
volume.	Due	to	reduced	 sulfur	content	in	the	fuel	vehicles	 emit	less	sulfur	dioxide,	which	
is	one	of	the	most	environmentally	hazardous	substances.
Despite	 reduced	 investments	 into	processing	 in	2009–2010,	 works	on	the	projects

set	by	the	Government.
SALES
In	2007–2009,	 Gazprom	 Neft	with	its	expanded	 sales	network	 in	Russia	has	strengthened	
its	positions	 in	retail	and	wholesale	 oil	products	 markets.	 Oil	products	 sales	volume	in	
the	domestic	 market	grew	by	17.2%	in	2008	(12.6%	in	2007)	up	to	15.7	mn	tons.	Taking	
the	crisis	into	account,	 in	2009	the	main	sales	target	will	be	to	retain	the	sale	volumes	
achieved	 in	2008.	The	Company	 is	constantly	 improving	 its	service	and	attracting	 new	
customers	thanks	to	its	reputation	of	a	reliable	partner.In	2009	the	plan	of	sales	network	 re-branding	 will	be	fulfilled	in	the	minimal	 volume:	over	
200	gas	stations	 (GS)	will	get	new	appearance	 and	improve	 their	service.	In	the	nearest	
future	no	new	GSs	are	planned	to	be	purchased. 	During	the	market	recession, 	the	Company	
will	search	for	land	lots	for	its	future	projects.	Official	land	registration 	takes	usually	plenty	
of	time,	so	it	is	important	 to	do	it	for	the	future.	The	Company	 is	particularly	 interested	 in	the	
most	promising	 and	developing	 Moscow	and	Saint	Petersburg	 areas,	as	well	as	in	the	regions	
neighboring	 oil	refineries	 (Moscow	 Refinery,	 Omsk	Refinery	 and	Yaroslavnefteorgsintez). 	
Instead	of	extensive	 sales	network	 expansion	 the	program	 of	increasing	 regional	 sales	
efficiency 	will	continue	being	implemented, 	which	provides	for	a	common 	system	of	
customers	 attraction	 in	all	GSs.	The	implementation	 involves	 introducing	 of	flexible	
demand	stimulation	 mechanisms:	 discounts,	 bonuses,	 prize	drawings,	 etc.	Consequently,	 a	
comprehensive 	system	of	active	sales	will	be	built,	when	the	Company 	meets	the	customer’s	
requirements	through	understanding	his	needs	and	timely	responding	to	them.
OIL SERVICES
In	2007	Gazprom	 Neft	restructured	 its	oil	service	sector.	Established	 in	September	
2007	JSC	Gazpromneft-Nefteservice	 took	over	the	guidance	 of	the	following	 units:		
JSC	Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegazgeofizika,	 LLC	Well	Overhaul-Service,	 LLC	Service	
Drilling	Company	 and	another	 seven	service	business	 units.	The	resulting	 company	
has	become	 one	of	major	Russian	 oil	service	companies	 with	optimized	 business	 units	
structure	and	possibility	to	work	on	large-scale	projects.In	the	second	half	of	2008	and	early	2009,	the	Company’s	 oil	service	sector	due		
to	decrease	 in	orders,	first	of	all	for	new	wells	drilling,	 faced	rather	a	complicated	
situation.	 The	number	 of	drilling	crews	will	have	to	be	reduced;	 instead,	 the	employees	
will	get	additional	qualification,	in	particular,	in	repairs	of	existing	wells.OIL PRODUCTS SALES

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009EFFICIENCY POLICY   
– TACTICAL OPTIMIZATION
In	2007–2008,	 Gazprom	 Neft	became	 a	leader	among	top-five	Russian	 oil	companies	 in	terms	of	economic 	efficiency. 	This	
is	evidenced 	by	the	highest	specific	net	profit	of	the	Company. 	The	economic 	recession 	started	in	2008	put	the	whole	industry	
into	more	severe	conditions	 than	ever	before.	Due	to	the	crisis,	in	2008–2009,	 all	managerial	 and	expert	efforts	were	focused	
on	optimization	 of	current	and	operating	 expenses.	 The	optimization	 policy	will	continue	 and	will	be	further	implemented	 and	
enforced	with	special	anti-crisis	programs.
JSC	Gazprom	 Neft	management	 sees	several	possible	 scenarios	 of	2009–2010.	 The	main	scenario	 is	based	on	USD	50	per	
bbl;	while	the	stress	scenario	assumes 	an	oil	price	of	USD	30	per	bbl.	The	package	of	anti-crisis 	measures 	elaborated 	by	
the	Company 	for	each	scenario	includes	the	following: 	firstly,	revision	and	optimization 	of	the	investment 	portfolio; 	secondly,	
reduction	of	operating	expenses	and	search	for	internal	reserves;	and,	thirdly,	revision	of	contracts	with	contractors.Each	sector	has	its	own	expenditures 	structure. 	The	policy	of	increasing 	of	the	Company’s 	overall	effectiveness 	is	intended	for	
optimization	of	major	expense	items.For	oil	producing	 companies	 key	optimization	 measures	 include	shutdown	 of	not-paying	 and	unprofitable	 wells,	reduction	 of	pipe	
breaks,	energy	saving	projects.	In	some	cases	anti-crisis 	measures 	turned	out	to	be	needless 	due	to	efficient	performance. 	For	
example, 	due	to	the	fact	that	Gazprom 	Neft	chooses	precise	and	reasonable 	priorities 	in	its	construction 	program, 	the	volumes	
of	construction	 of	facilities	 meant	for	oil	production	 volume	support	have	not	virtually	been	cut	(these	include	pipelines,	 power	
lines,	pumping	 units,	roads,	bushes).	 Another	important	 aspect	of	the	crisis-anticipatory	 optimization	 was	the	reorganization 	
of	Gazprom	Neft’s	Scientific	and	Analytical	Department	into	the	Scientific	and	Technical	Center	(STC)	in	2007.The	key	goal	of	STC	is	to	stabilize	oil	production 	in	2009–2010 	and	increase	its	capacity	starting	from	2011,	when	new	assets	
are	to	be	put	into	operation.STC’s	researches 	are	purely	practical	and	utilize	scientists’ 	potential 	in	the	achievement 	of	business 	objectives 	and	realization	
of	the	sustainable	 development	 concept.	 For	example,	 after	the	Center	had	examined	 the	practice	of	bed	hydraulic	 fracturing 	
designs,	proppant 	(a	material	increasing 	oil-well	output)	costs	decreased	 by	30%.	Before,	the	amount	of	proppant	 per	well

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009was	traditionally	 calculated	 at	a	rate	of	10	tons	per	meter	of	thickness.	 STC	experts	proved	
this	was	a	stereotype,	 and	the	amount	of	material	 should	be	calculated	 on	the	basis	of	
each	specific	well’s	parameters.
The	STC	employs	 six	doctors	of	sciences,	 five	professors,	 34	candidates	 of	sciences. 	
The	Company	 uses	their	intellectual	 and	pedagogic	 potential	 to	train	the	staff	employed 	
by	subsidiaries	 and	affiliates,	 as	well	as	field	crews;	several	educational	 programs	 were	
launched	 in	March	2008.	A	well-equipped	 St.	Petersburg	 Visualization	 Centre	makes	it	
possible	to	observe	on	a	specific	bed	example	 the	results	of	utilizing	of	various	development 	
and	production	technologies.The	STC	expert	support	covers	all	stages	of	oil	exploration	 and	production.	 So,	the	Center	
includes	 a	Department	 for	Long-Term	 Forecasting	 in	such	destinations	 as	East	Siberia,	
Arctic	shelf,	Komi	Republic,	 Kazakhstan,	 Black	Sea	territory.	 Databases	 on	foreign	territories 	
of	Gazprom 	Neft’s	interest	were	purchased 	for	STC	use,	as	the	Company 	is	turning	into	an	
international	structure.For	oil	processing 	units,	the	key	optimization 	area	is	the	extension 	of	overhaul	periods,	
improving	 labor	productivity,	 energy	saving	projects.	 For	example,	 the	economic	 effect	at	
a	rate	of	about	one	billion	rubles	shall	be	achieved	 through	new	proposals	 in	respect	of	
increasing	 production	 performance	 and	costs	cutting	at	the	Omsk	Refinery.	 The	management 	
board	of	JSC	Gazprom 	Neft	approved 	113	such	proposals 	within	the	framework 	of	the	Total	
Production	Optimization	(TPO)	Program	introduced	in	2008.For	the	administrative	 sector,	it	is	important	 to	optimize	 the	number	of	employees	 and	to	
largely	minimize 	the	volume	of	services	rendered	 by	external	 contractors	 and	advisors.	 For	
example,	 the	oil	sector	traditionally	 utilizes	expensive	 managerial	 tools	more	actively	in	
comparison	 with	other	industries	 cooperating	 with	the	best	and	most	renowned	 consulting	
companies.	 In	2008–2009,	 Gazprom	 Neft	started	selecting	 partners	 on	the	basis	of	not	
only	quality,	but	also	price.Measures	 taken	in	2008–2009	 to	reduce	costs	in	the	block	of	prospecting	 and	production 	
resulted	 in	costs	optimization	 by	RUR	4.5	bn;	and	by	RUR	1.8	bn	in	logistics,	 refining	and	
sales,	and	the	block	of	oil	service	cut	costs	by	RUR	2	bn.	Due	to	efficiency	 increasing 	
measures,	 JSC	Gazprom	 Neft	enjoys	a	stable	position	and	does	not	run	either	considerable 	
current	or	future	risks.INVESTIGATION AND EXTRACTION

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009MOTIVATION 
AND LABOR REMUNERATION
Gazprom	Neft	applies	a	comprehensive	system	of	motivation	based	on	competitive	wages	and	performance	remuneration.
As	far	back	as	in	2006,	with	the	Company’s	 growth	new	motivation	 methods	 and	HR	management	 policy	had	to	be	developed.	
In	2007	a	united	system	of	quarterly	 motivation	 was	developed	 and	implemented.	 It	includes	 both	achievement	 of	corporate	
goals,	such	as	the	Company’s	financial	results,	and	meeting	objectives	relating	to	a	specific	functional	line.A	system	of	target-oriented	 management	 (TOM)	is	in	force	for	key	managers.	 It	allows	targets	cascading	 from	Gazprom	 Neft	
General	Director	 to	heads	of	departments	 of	subsidiaries	 and	affiliates.	 The	TOM	system	enables	to	plan	clearly	and	achieve	
the	Company’s	 key	performance	 indicators,	 and	realize	most	important	 strategic	 initiatives.	 The	program	 involves	every	of	
550	key	managers	of	the	corporate	center,	subsidiaries	and	affiliates.The	so	called	grade	system	is	considered	 to	be	the	key	element	 in	the	labor	motivation	 being	elaborated	 and	actively	
implemented	 during	2006–2009.	 A	grade	means	a	range	of	positions	 having	approximately	 equal	value	for	the	company	
(similar	 functional,	 competence,	 experience	 and	responsibility	 requirements).	 A	grade	is	determined	 by	such	universal	
criteria	as	professional	 skills,	knowledge	 of	features	 of	the	business	 and	the	Company,	 social	competence,	 intellectual	
capacity,	 and	level	of	the	work	complexity,	 independent	 decision-making,	 scale	and	nature	of	influence.	 The	evaluation	 has	
determined	 job	hierarchies,	 which	were	subsequently	 grouped	 by	grades.	There	are	23	grades	included	 into	the	system.	
Within	the	scheduled	 wage	revision	the	amount	of	bonuses	 and	composition	 of	the	package	 are	attached	 not	to	the	position	
itself,	but	to	the	grade.Starting	 from	some	pilot	projects	 launched	 in	the	second	half	of	2008	at	LLC	Gazpromneft-Khantos,	 the	Omsk	Refinery	 and	
JSC	Gazpromneft-Omsk,	the	grading	system	was	introduced	at	subsidiaries	as	well.PERSONNEL	DEVELOPMENT

SOCIAL PACKAGE
In	2007–2009,	 Gazprom	 Neft	traditionally	 utilized	social	programs	 as	an	additional	 tool	of	employees	 attraction	 and	retention.	
Along	with	statutory	 benefits,	 the	social	package	 includes	 voluntary	 medical	insurance,	 accident	 insurance,	 death	allowance,	
payment	 for	meals,	anniversary	 bonuses,	 financial	 aid,	payment	 for	tourist	vouchers,	 eventual	 financial	 aid	(marriage,	 child	
birth,	etc.),	holiday	gifts	for	employees	and	their	families.	
In	2007	the	average	 amount	of	a	social	payment	 made	RUR	14.7	thousand	 per	employee,	 which	shows	a	35%	increase		
as	compared	 to	2006.	The	dynamics	 continued,	 and	in	2008	a	payment	 per	employee	 amounted	 to	RUR	32	thousand,	 that	
is,	more	than	doubled	within	one	year.
COOPERATION WITH LABOR UNIONS
Two	thirds	of	Gazprom	 Neft	employees	 are	members	 of	labor	unions,	including	 85%	of	employees	 from	KMAA	and	Omsk	
region.	Therefore	 the	2007–2009	 proved	to	be	the	years	of	close	cooperation	 between	 the	Company	 management	 and	
the	labor	union.	Primary	 labor	union	units	are	established	 at	some	of	the	Company’s	 enterprises.	 So,	in	early	2009,	the	
employees	 of	LLC	Gazpromneft-Center	 decided	 to	establish	 a	primary	 labor	union	unit,	The	Professional	 Union	of	Oil,		
Gas	and	Construction	Workers	of	the	Russian	Federation.The	Company	 realizes	that	the	goal	of	the	labor	union	is	not	limited	to	the	protection	 of	employees’	 interests	 and	influence	 	
on	labor	relations,	 but	also	represents	 a	kind	of	the	public	mood	indicator.	 The	labor	union	expresses	 the	employees’	
reaction	 upon	the	social	and	economic	 policy	carried	out	by	the	enterprise,	 and	contributes	 to	its	timely	correction.	 In	
view	of	this	Gazprom	 Neft	welcomed	 the	Company	 staff	initiative	 of	establishment	 of	the	Interregional	 Labor	Union	as	a	
coordination	body	for	representatives	of	each	team.	We	worked	on	this	in	2008	and	will	keep	on	working	in	2009.PERSONNEL	DEVELOPMENT

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009The	dialogue	 between	 the	management	 and	representatives	 of	labor	teams	is	especially	
important	 in	the	situation	 when	the	Company	 is	facing	difficult	 times	and	searching	 	
for	opportunities	to	improve	its	performance.	
CORPORATE SPORTS AND HEALTH
A	poll	taken	by	Gazprom	 Neft	in	2007	showed	that	70%	of	employees	 are	satisfied	 with	
the	conditions	 for	sports	and	improving	 health	at	their	enterprise.	 However,	 30%	of	their	
colleagues	 expressed	 a	negative	 evaluation	 of	the	health	support	program,	 and	induced	
the	Company	to	activate	its	sports	policy.
In	order	to	organize	 sports	acticities,	 develop	and	realize	plans	and	programs	 of	sports	
and	health	improving	 events,	Gazrpom	 Neft	established	 a	Committee	 for	Sports	and	
Health	Improving	 in	2007,	headed	by	the	CEO	of	Gazprom	 Neft	Alexander	 Dyukov.		
The	Committee	 includes	 the	managers	 of	the	Company	 itself,	its’	subsidiaries	 	
and	affiliates,	 as	well	as	well-known	 sportsmen,	 Olympic	champions	 and	world	champions.	
In	February	 2008,	the	first	calendar	 Schedule	 of	sports	and	health-improving	 events	was	
drawn	and	approved;	financial	support	in	terms	of	sports	increased	considerably.In	2008–2009,	 the	number	of	contests	 and	tournaments	 held	by	Gazprom	 Neft	and	involving	
the	Company	 employees	 has	grown	significantly.	 So,	football	and	chess	tournaments	 	
in	2007	involved	 180	Company’s	 employees	 from	12	enterprises.	 A	year	later,	corporate	
sport	events	involved	 as	many	as	about	1000	people	from	39	enterprises.	 Gazprom	 Neft	
summer	 sports	contest,	which	took	place	in	Moscow	 in	August-September	 2008,	is	going	
to	become	an	annual	tradition	 uniting	five	most	popular	sports	in	the	Company	 (football,	
volleyball,	ping-pong,	weight-lifting	and	chess).The	schedule	 of	the	Company’s	 events	undergoes	 annual	updates	 and	new	interesting	
events	are	added.	JSC	Gazprom	 Neft	winter	corporate	 skiing	contest	(Gazprom	 Neft		
Ski	Track)	and	snow	football	in	Omsk	became	 the	first	important	 sports	events	held		
by	the	Company	in	2009.In	2009	a	concept	 of	the	Company’s	 Sports	and	Health	Support	 Program	 toward	2012	
will	be	elaborated.	 It	is	based	on	a	large-scale	 monitoring	 of	Gazprom	 Neft’s	employees’

programs	 and	projects	 aimed	at	the	social	infrastructure	 development.	 Gazprom	 Neft	efforts	are	welcomed	 by	regional

Gazprom 	Neft’s	key	charity 	activities 	include:
•  financing of projects upon applications from heads of regions, municipal units, public and religious associations;
•  entering into comprehensive social and economic agreements with regions;
•  Gazprom Neft Cup, an all-Russian interregional hockey tournament among children’s teams.
In	2007	the	Company	 reorganized	 its	social	initiative	 management	 practice.	 The	Commission	 for	Regional	 Policy	was

ASSISTANCE IN THE FRAMES OF REGIONAL AGREEMENTS
Cooperation	 programs	 in	the	regions	of	Gazprom	 Neft	activities	 are	realized	through	social	and	economic	 agreements	 with	
regional	 and	municipal	 authorities.	 Socially	important	 projects	 requiring	 financing	 are	suggested	 by	the	administrations	
of	the	federal	regions	and	territories,	 which	Gazprom	 Neft	has	entered	into	agreements	 with.	The	Company	 examines	 the	
suggestions	 in	terms	of	their	compliance	 to	the	criteria	of	its	Charity	Policy.	Charity	financing	 is	conditional	 upon	transparent	
spending	control.	Gazprom	Neft	provides	aid	for	a	specific	program,	which	can	not	be	used	for	any	other	purpose.
In	2007–2008,	 Gazprom	 Neft	provided	 assistance	 to	six	regions:	 Yamal-Nenets	 and	Khanty-Mansi	 Autonomous	 Areas,	Omsk,	
Tomsk	and	Tyumen	regions,	 Krasnodar	 territory.	 This	sector’s	funding	totaled	in	2008	to	RUR	830.4	mn	(which	exceeds	 by	
40%	the	2007	figure).	In	2008	all	planned	 agreements	 were	concluded.	 Timely	and	complete	 fulfillment	 of	the	terms	of	those	
agreements	in	2007–2009	allowed	the	Company	to:
• support constructive relationship with the authorities of the regions of the Company’s presence;
• support favorable investment environment for the Company’s enterprises in key regions of its presence.
In	February	 2009,	while	developing	 its	regional	 policy	program	 the	Company	 signed	a	three-year	 agreement	 of	social	and

a	complete	 set	of	operating	 standards	 for	gas	stations	staff.	Since	2008,	all	GSs	staff	is	being	retrained	 in	conformity	 with	the	
program	 prepared	 according	 to	standards.	 The	purpose	 of	the	retraining	 is	to	teach	the	employees	 the	principles	 of	client-

was	now	attached	 to	the	cashless	 payment	 system	Petrol	Plus	based	on	microprocessor

realize	its	responsibility	before	the	society	for	creating	safe	labor	conditions	and	conservation	of	favorable	environment.
PRINCIPLES AND TARGETS OF THE POLICY
The	Company	 guarantees	 adequate	 and	safe	labor	conditions	 to	its	employees,	 as	well	as	compliance	 with	environment	
protection	requirements.
The	Policy	determines	 the	Company’s	 key	goals	and	objectives	 and	prescribes	 equal	treatment	 of	industrial	 safety,	labor	and	
environment	protection	issues	and	economic	issues.
The	policy	has	been	developed	 and	implemented	 due	to	forming	of	a	separate	 corporate	 unit	of	the	Department	 of	Industrial	
and	Environmental	 Safety,	Labor	and	Civil	Protection.	 Its	appearance	 was	induced	 by	the	understanding	 of	the	fact	that	
today’s	labor	safety	culture	requires	 continuous	 and	consistent	 efforts,	as	well	as	personal	 involvement	 of	all	employees	
and	understanding	 by	each	manager	 of	his/her	personal	 responsibility.	 Today	the	Policy	implementation	 is	ensured		
by	the	General	Director	of	JSC	Gazprom	Neft	and	managers	at	all	Company	levels.IMPLEMENTATION

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009
The	Policy	formulates	 the	Company’s	 strategic	 goal	of	becoming	 a	leader	among	
world	oil	and	gas	companies	 in	terms	of	industrial	 and	environmental	 safety,	labor	
and	civil	protection	 (IES,	LP	and	CP).	This	involves	 an	everyday	 contribution	 to	the	
improvement	 of	labor	conditions,	 increasing	 of	the	level	of	industrial	 and	environmental 	
safety,	implementation	 of	an	efficient	 IES,	LP	and	CP	management	 system,	 exchange 	
of	information	 with	interested	 parties,	 increasing	 the	employees’	 competence	 and	
involvement 	in	the	Policy	realization, 	setting	higher	environmental 	and	industrial 	safety	
requirements	 toward	the	Company’s	 own	business	 units	and	toward	contractors	 working	
on	the	Company’s	projects.
The	principles	fixed	in	the	Policy	determine	the	Company’s	goals	and	objectives:
•  consistent reduction of the occupational injury rate, occupational diseases, accident 
rate and negative environmental impact;
•  organization of safe production and environmental protection by implementing  
by 2011 of a single integrated IS, LP and EP management system in JSC Gazprom 
Neft’s production units, complying with the world standards including processes of 
hazard identification, occupational risk assessment and management;
•  consistent implementation of the world best practices in the fields of engineering, 
technology and industrial safety, labor and environment protection management  at all production units of JSC Gazprom Neft. 
In	order	to	realize	the	preset	goals,	a	Target-Oriented	 Management	 Program	 was	
introduced	 in	the	Company.	 Within	the	activity	horizon	of	each	manager	 and	each	profile	
department,	 personal	 values	of	IES,	LP	and	CP	are	set,	which,	when	successfully	 met,	
brings	the	Company	 closer	to	its	strategic	 goal,	namely	to	a	leading	position	 among	the	
world	peers	in	the	field	of	industrial	 safety,	labor	and	environment	 protection.	 It	is	not	
the	efforts	made	that	are	considered	 to	be	the	key	factor	of	success	 assessment,	 but		
the	efficiency	of	the	respective	measure.INDUSTRIAL	AND	ENVIRONMENTAL	SAFETY,

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009SYSTEMIC TOOLS OF THE SAFETY POLICY REALIZATION
The	basic	tool	of	the	Policy	realization	 is	the	risk	management	 mechanism.	 In	the	second	half	2008,	the	company	 developed	
and	approved	 the	Procedure	 of	Detection,	 Assessment	 and	Minimization	 of	Industrial	 and	Environmental	 Safety,	Labor		
and	Civil	Protection	Risks,	which	regulates	this	process.
In	2009	the	Company	 intends	to	launch	a	full-scale	 risk	assessment	 of	works	performed	 on	the	Company’s	 project	in	order	
to	form	an	IES,	LP	and	CP	risk	portfolio,	 and	elaborate	 respective	 minimization	 measures.	 The	risks	detected	 according	 	
to	this	methodology	 will	be	ranked	and,	pursuant	 to	a	risk’s	importance,	 certain	correcting	 measures	 will	be	included		
in	future	budgeting.
In	2008	an	Integrated	 IES,	LP	and	CP	management	 system	was	developed	 and	introduced	 in	the	Company,	 complying	 with	
key	recommendations	 of	the	International	 Association	 of	Oil	and	Gas	Producers,	 and	requirements	 of	international	 ISO	9000,	
14001,	OHSAS	19001	standards.	 The	document	 allows	systemizing	 all	activities	 in	this	field,	setting	respective	 priorities,	
ensuring	 personnel	 development	 and	forming	 the	basis	of	enterprise	 assessment.	 Starting	 from	2009,	the	system	will		
be	intensively	implemented	at	all	units	of	the	Company.
Moreover,	 in	2008	the	Company	 elaborated	 and	launched	 the	Azimuth	 system	representing	 an	IES,	LP	and	CP	information	
&	control	system	for	integration	 of	collected	 industrial	 safety	information,	 automation	 and	standardization	 of	managerial	
reporting,	 improving	 control	of	compliance	 with	industrial	 safety	requirements,	 immediately	 informing	 about	accidents	 	
and	measures	taken,	providing	assistance	in	investigations	directing	them	toward	detection	of	key	causes	of	the	accidents.	
OUTLOOK OF THE POLICY
At	the	same	time,	the	Company	 has	got	a	considerable	 reserve	for	improvement	 of	industrial	 and	environmental	 safety.	
Gazprom	 Neft	is	on	the	way	to	create	its	corporate	 IES,	LP	and	CP	management	 system,	where	any	managerial	 decision	 shall	
consider	 and	give	priority	to	safety	reasons.	 Therefore,	 in	2009	the	focus	will	be	put	on	involvement	 of	all-level	 managers	 	
in	the	development	of	IES,	LP	and	CP	system.
The	Company’s	 priority	includes	 the	construction	 of	a	living	system.	 In	the	second	half	of	2009,	existing	targets	will	be	
complemented	 with	new	initiatives,	 such	as	fire	safety	standard	 implementation.	 As	of	late,	there	have	more	fires	occurred	
at	the	Company	 as	compared	 with	the	previous	 year	(12	in	2008,	against	eight	in	2007)	due	to	non-compliance	 with	fire	safety	
rules,	wear	of	process	 equipment,	 non-compliance	 with	vehicle	operational	 conditions.	 Therefore,	 important	 measures	 	
to	be	taken	in	the	Company	 in	2009	shall	include	compliance	 with	schedules	 and	plans	of	current	and	scheduled	 equipment	
repairs,	targeted	 checks	of	compliance	 with	fire	safety	norms	and	rules,	conducting	 fire	alarm	in	offices	and	administration	
buildings,	conducting	fire-fighting	trainings	on	industrial	facilities.
KEY	RESULT	OF	THE	SYSTEMIC	APPROACH	TO	THE	SAFETY	POLICY:		
IN	2008	THERE	WERE	NO	WORK	ACCIDENTS	AT	GAZPROM	NEFT’S	ENTERPRISES		(TWO	ACCIDENTS	IN	2007).INDUSTRIAL	AND	ENVIRONMENTAL	SAFETY,		
LABOR	PROTECTION	–	DEVELOPING	SAFELY62OVERVIEW	OF	SUSTAINABLE	DEVELOPMENT
JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009REDUCTION OF INJURY RATE
One	of	the	main	goals	of	the	Policy	is	to	reduce	the	accident	 and	injury	rate.	In	a	company	 with	complicated	 and	hazardous	
production	 processes,	 this	problem	 immediately	 demonstrates	 the	rate	of	the	corporation’s	 seriousness	 in	treating		
of	the	labor	safety.
Labor	protection	 costs	per	employee	 increase	 annually:	 in	2007	the	figure	amounted	 to	RUR	6500,	and	in	2008	achieved	
RUR	12200.	The	funds	are	applied	toward	workplace	 certification,	 improvement	 of	medical	 service,	provision	 of	employees	 	
with	PPE.To	avoid	wasting	of	funds	and	ensure	high	efficiency	 of	the	measures	 assumed,	 one	should	be	aware	of	the	kinds	of	incidents	
occurring	 at	the	Company,	 as	well	as	of	direct	and	systemic	 reasons	 of	their	occurrence.	 JSC	Gazprom	 Neft	is	aware	that	
a	system	offering	 a	possibility	 to	hide	industrial	 accidents	 is	absolutely	 unacceptable.	 In	this	connection,	 the	Company	
implements	a	program	for	increasing	of	reporting	transparency.	The	Company’s	subsidiaries	and	affiliates	on	a	permanent	
basis	exchange	information	in	respect	of	accidents	and	investigation	results.
Consequently,	 the	rate	of	transparency	 in	respect	of	accidents	 (ratio	between	 major,	significant	 and	insignificant	 accidents)	
in	2008	grew	by	40%	as	compared	 to	2007,	and	achieved	 the	level	of	the	world	leading	oil	companies.	 The	speed	of	injury	
cases	reporting	improved	as	well	(97%	of	the	events	were	reported	within	24	hours).The	Company	 management	 believes	 that	registration	 of	accidents	 without	an	adequate	 investigation	 and	elimination	
of	all	causes	giving	rise	to	them	is	a	waste	of	resources.	 Therefore	 in	2008,	there	was	a	certain	standard	 Accidents.	
Immediate	 Reporting,	 Investigation,	 Accounting	 and	Periodic	 Reporting	 elaborated;	 managers	 and	specialists	 were	trained	
in	comprehensive	 investigation;	 Lessons	 Learned	 from	accidents	 exchange	 is	performed	 on	a	regular	basis.	In	2009		
the	Company	 is	going	to	keep	on	fulfilling	 regular	quality	analysis	 of	accident	 investigations	 and	increase	 the	transparency	
of	the	statistics	by	at	least	50%,	as	well	as	reduce	at	the	same	time	the	number	of	major	accidents	by	30%.
IMPROVING EMPLOYEES’ COMPETENCES IN LABOR PROTECTION, INDUSTRIAL  
AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
Regular	 analysis	 of	accidents	 shows	that	a	great	part	of	them	is	caused	by	non-compliance	 with	occupational	 discipline	 	
and	industrial	 process	 requirements,	 therefore	 professional	 advancement	 of	employees	 is	very	important	 in	the	sphere		
of	injury	rate	control,	including	 clarification	 of	the	necessity	 of	compliance	 with	labor	protection,	 industrial	 and	environmental	
safety	requirements.LABOR PROTECTION

LABOR	PROTECTION	–	DEVELOPING	SAFELY63OVERVIEW	OF	SUSTAINABLE	DEVELOPMENT
JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009Gazprom	 Neft	requires	 from	all	managers	 and	employees	 of	the	Company	 to	be	aware	
of	their	responsibility	 for	their	own	and	other	persons’	 safety.	In	this	connection,	 	
any	employee	 is	entitled	to	stop	and/or	refuse	to	perform	 an	operation	 putting	in	danger	
his/her	life	or	health	or	that	of	other	people.	In	order	to	improve	 the	employees’	 safety	
competence,	various	forms	of	training	and	coaching	are	encouraged.
	In	2008	trainings	 were	launched	 for	the	Company	 staff	in	IES,	LP	and	CP.	Specialists	
of	IES,	LP	and	CP	Department,	 as	well	as	instructors	 of	specialized	 companies	 trained	
about	1000	people	in	the	major	production	sections.
In	2009	the	Company	 plans	to	apply	a	more	systemic	 approach	 by	creating	 a	division	
of	internal	 instructors	 with	a	corporate	 training	 program	 to	be	presented	 by	them	
subsequently.
PROVIDING EMPLOYEES WITH UP-TO-DATE  
PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT (PPE)
Although	 personal	 protection	 equipment	 is	the	last	barrier	between	 the	employee 		
and	the	hazard	(in	case	of	preventive	 measures	 failure),	 it	allows	considerable 	
minimization	 of	the	hazard	impact	upon	his/her	life	and	health.	Therefore	 the	Company 	
attaches	 great	importance	 to	the	provision	 of	employees	 with	PPE.	The	respective 	
program 	has	been	launched 	as	far	back	as	in	December 	2007.	In	2008	an	analysis	of	
PPE	market	was	carried	out	and	subsequently	 the	following	 were	elaborated	 on	the	
basis	of	its	results	and	on-site	tests:
•  a corporate standard Procedure of Employees Provision  
with Personal Protection Equipment;
•  a catalogue of PPE allowed for use at the Company;
•  a technical specification for overalls manufactured in Gazprom Neft corporate style. 
While	implementing	 the	program,	 the	Company	 focuses	 not	only	on	PPE	provision,	 	
but	also	on	employees	 training	for	correct	and	efficient	 usage	of	PPE,	explanatory	 work	
about	advantages	of	PPE	and	innovative	PPE.
The	Company	 takes	an	active	part	in	the	legislation	 drafting	in	the	field	of	standardization	
of	personal	 protection	 equipment	 for	oil	industry	 workers.	 JSC	Gazprom	 Neft	has		
proposed	some	amendments	to	the	public	Standards	of	Free-of-Charge	PPE	Provision…A	pilot	project	on	providing	 JSC	Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegaz	 employees	 with	doublet	
winter	overalls	in	the	corporate	style	has	already	been	put	into	effect.New	types	of	employees’	 PPE	are	systematically	 being	put	at	disposal.	 These	include:	
purchase	 of	wear	made	of	fabrics	not	only	protecting	 from	hazardous	 factors	(exposure	 	
to	open	flame,	electric	arc	and	chemical	 substances),	 but	also	complying	 with	the	re-
quirements	 of	Oexo-Tex	 Standart	 100.	Textile	tested	pursuant	 to	Oexo-Tex	 Standart	 100

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009INVESTMENTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT
Being	one	of	the	world’s	biggest	oil	and	gas	companies,	 JSC	Gazprom	 Neft	fully	realizes	its	responsibility	 before	the	society	
for	conservation	 of	favorable	 environment.	 The	Company	 tries	to	fully	meet	the	requirements	 of	the	present	environmental	
legislation,	compensating	to	the	utmost	the	damages	caused	to	the	nature	by	its	activities.
In	accordance	 with	active	regulations,	 the	Company	 takes	comprehensive	 measures	 in	terms	of	adoption	 of	environmental	
norms	and	determination	 of	maximum	 permissible	 levels	of	environmental	 impact;	 requirements	 in	respect	 of	field	
development	 project	documentation	 expert	examination	 are	constantly	 monitored,	 as	well	as	requirements	 in	respect		
of	hydrocarbons	processing	authorization	and	compliance	with	license	obligations.Amounts	 paid	by	JSC	Gazprom	 Neft’s	key	units	for	exceeding	 the	norms	of	environmental	 impact	are	insignificant	 compared	
to	the	Company’s	scale.	In	2008	it	amounted	to	about	RUR	58	mn;	about	RUR	47	mn	in	2007.During	the	last	three	years	the	Company’s	 current	expenses	 on	environmental	 measures	 including	 technologies	 of	negative	
environmental	 impact	optimization,	 exceed	manifold	 the	amount	 paid	by	the	Company	 for	the	environment	 pollution.	 	
In	2008	those	costs	made	RUR	1018,2	mn	against	RUR	577.7	mn	in	2007.	The	funds	are	spent	on	elaboration	 of	norms,	
environmental	 monitoring,	 industrial	 environmental	 control,	 recovery	 of	oil	polluted	 territories,	 equipment	 upgrading,	
professional	advancement	and	environmental	protection	trainings.In	2009	the	Company	 will	due	to	the	crisis	implement	 some	adjustment	 measures	 to	reduce	its	technogenic	 environmental	
impact	to	the	amount	of	RUR	705	mn.	In	particular:	•  launch the practice of annual pipelines overhaul at the rate of at least 400 km,  
to ensure the frequency of ruptures by 300 per year;
• ensure 100% replacement of leak clamps after rupture elimination;• increase the level of pipeline operation (inhibition, troubleshooting, reduction of aggressiveness of pumped fluid);• ensure timely drafting (prolongation) of environmental authorizations;•  ensure adequate financing of measures for re-vegetation of oil polluted land and slime bins to avoid paying  extra charges for exceeding the limits.ENVIRONMENTAL

STOCK-TAKING OF GREENHOUSE GASES
Oil	industry	 operations	 entail	great	atmospheric	 loads.	It	is	impossible	 to	achieve	
immediate	 crucial	results;	 however,	 optimization	 measures	 always	result	in	positive	
changes.
During	the	last	years,	gross	gas	emissions	 by	Gazprom	 Neft’s	enterprises	 remained	
approximately	 on	the	same	level,	showing	 insignificant	 positive	(downward)	 dynamics.	 	
In	view	of	the	company’s	 activity	magnification,	 the	stability	of	this	index	shall	be	deemed	
as	a	success.	 This	was	supported	 by	reconstruction	 of	industrial	 facilities,	 replacement	
of	burner	devices,	 optimization	 of	technological	 parameters,	 reconstruction	 of	tanks		
and	implementation	 of	a	unit	for	precise	 and	leak-proof	 loading	 of	oil	products.	 	
The	efficiency	 of	measures	 is	growing	 consistently;	 2008	demonstrated	 a	downward	
trend	in	hazardous	 atmospheric	 emissions	 in	2007	(from	161.8	to	157.2	Kt).	The	Company	
expects	that	the	positive	dynamics	will	continue	in	2009.
PRODUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FUEL
The	program	 developed	 at	the	Omsk	Refinery	 provides	 for	a	complete	 changeover	 to	the	
production	 of	environmentally	 friendly	fuels	by	2012.	In	2008	about	9%	of	automobile	 fuel	
manufactured	by	the	plant	complied	with	EURO	3	standard	requirements.In	2009–2010,	 an	installation	 of	annual	rated	capacity	 of	800	thousand	 tons	isomerizate	
is	planned	 for	construction.	 The	isomerizate	 is	one	of	the	most	valuable	 high-
octane	components	 of	today’s	engine	fuel.	It	does	not	contain	any	olefinic	or	aromatic	
hydrocarbons;	 therefore,	 the	end	product	(fuel)	becomes	 more	environmentally	 friendly.	
The	upgrading	 will	enable	the	ONPZ	to	change	over	to	the	production	 of	EURO	4	and	
EURO	5	standard	diesel	fuel.The	construction	 of	the	isomerization	 plant	is	the	first	step	in	realization	 of	the	medium-
term	investment	 program	 aimed	at	the	production	 of	environmentally	 friendly	fuels.	
According	 to	Gazprom	 Neft’s	decision,	 plants	to	be	constructed	 at	ONPZ	will	form	the	
basis	for	the	Company	 to	enter	absolutely	 new	markets	 and	contribute	 to	the	environ-

JSC	GAZPROM	NEFT	2007–2009POWER AND WATER CONSUMPTION
In	2008	water	consumption	 for	internal	 needs	grew	by	15%	as	compared	 to	2007	due	to	launching	 of	a	drilling	waste	
recycling	complex	at	Gazpromneft-Khantos.
Intensification	 of	the	Company’s	 activities	 affects	the	power	consumption	 as	well,	which	results	in	a	5.5%	increase	 from	
2007	to	2008.In	2009	water	and	power	consumption	 will	also	be	considerably	 affected	by	the	macroeconomic	 situation,	 which	determines	
the	Company’s	demands	for	new	projects	and	activities.
WASTE TREATMENT
Major	part	of	the	Company’s	 operational	 waste	consists	 of	drilling	waste	of	IV	hazard	grade	(low	hazard).	 Total	share	of	low	
hazard	and	virtually	non-hazardous	 waste	(grade	V)	exceeds	90%.	In	2008	activities	 on	improving	 of	waste	treatment	 became	
systemic,	which	can	be	observed	in	the	improved	statistics.JSC	Gazpromneft-ONPZ	 processes	 waste	oils	generated	 by	the	enterprise	 by	way	of	sending	 the	waste	industrial	 oils		
to	a	FPU	(fuel-power	unit)	for	re-use	as	a	component	of	fuel	oil.
	In	2007	a	mobile	cleaning	 unit	was	implemented	 at	oil	products	 supplying	 enterprises,	 intended	 for	removal	of	solid	deposits	
from	the	interior	tank	surface.	 The	cleaning	 is	performed	 by	way	of	supplying	 a	special	chemical	 mix	to	the	tank	walls	under	
high	pressure.	 After	the	walls	and	the	bottom	are	cleaned,	 the	resulting	 emulsion	 is	pumped	 out,	and	the	mobile	complex	
separates	petrol	out	of	it	which	can	be	used	further.
In	2008	Gazpromneft-Khantos	 put	into	operation	 a	unique	complex	 of	drilling	waste	recycling	 by	pumping	 them	into	the	bed	
instead	of	filling	slime	bins.	This	unprecedented	 in	Russia	project	was	realized	 in	cooperation	 with	M-I	SWACO	(Canada).	
The	Ministry	 of	Natural	Resources	 of	the	Russian	 Federation	 distinguished	 it	as	the	best	environmental	 project	of	2008		
in	the	nomination	 Nature	Conservation	 Technologies.	 Daily	capacity	 of	the	unit	for	industrial	 waste	pumping	 into	subsoil

RESTORATION OF OIL-POLLUTED TERRITORIES
In	2008	the	rate	of	slime	bins	and	oil-polluted	 land	recovery	 was	increased.	 In	order	to	reduce	the	volume	of	damaged	 soil,	
the	Company	implemented	binless	drilling	methods	on	a	number	of	fields	in	2009.
INCREASING ASSOCIATED GAS RECOVERY RATE
Within	continuous	 increase	 of	environmental	 responsibility	 and	economic	 efficiency	 Gazprom	 Neft	elaborated	 and	approved	
in	2008	a	medium-term	 investment	 program	 (MTIP)	for	increase	 of	recovery	 and	efficient	utilization	 of	associated	 petroleum	
gas	(APG)	for	2008–2010.	
The	share	of	APG	recovery	 at	key	production	 units	of	the	Company	 grew	in	2008	by	11%,	as	compared	 to	the	previous	 year,	
up	to	46.8%.	2009	forecast	is	61.2%.
Total	volume	of	investments	within	frame	of	the	medium-term	program	amounts	to	RUR	17.6	bn.	Of	them:
•  over RUR 12 bn spent on construction of gas collecting networks and gas processing facilities; 
•  about RUR 5 bn spent on development of own generation;
•  about RUR 600 mn spent on audit of existing APG resources, recovery of low-pressure gas, and organization of APG 
metering.
Actual	financing	 of	MTIP	in	2008	amounted	 to	106%	of	the	plan.	The	medium-term	 programs,	 subject	to	their	actualization	
in	2009,	will	allow	achieving	by	2011–2012	a	95%	rate	of	APG	recovery	at	JSC	Gazprom	Neft	oil	producing	units.

Provision	of	employees	
with	up-to-date	personal	protection	equipmentNew	types	of	PPE	are	being	put	at	employees’	disposal	systematically.	These	include	
purchase	of	wear	made	of	fabrics,	not	only	protecting	from	hazardous	factors	(exposure	
to	open	flame,	electric	arc	and	chemical	substances),	but	also	complying	with	the

6500,	and	in	2008	achieving	RUR	12200.	The	rate	of	transparency	in	respect	of	accidents	
(ratio	between	major,	significant	and	insignificant	accidents)	in	2008,	as	compared		
to	2007,	grew	by	40%	and	achieved	the	level	of	the	world	leading	oil	companies.		
The	speed	of	injury	events	reporting	improved	as	well	(97%	of	the	events	were	reported	
within	24	hours)GOAL REALIZATION
In	2008	the	Company	developed	and	introduced	an	Integrated	IES,	LP	and	CP	management 	
system,	complying	with	key	recommendations	of	the	International	Association	of	Oil	and 	
Gas	Producers	and	requirements	of	international	ISO	9000,	14001,	OHSAS	19001	standards.
Registration	of	accidents	without	a	comprehensive	investigation	and	elimination	of	all	causes 	
giving	rise	to	them	is	a	waste	of	resources.	Therefore	in	2008	there	was	a	standard	Accidents. 	
Immediate	Reporting,	Investigation,	Accounting	and	Periodic	Reporting	elaborated; 	
managers	and	specialists	were	trained	in	comprehensive	investigation;	Lessons	Learned
