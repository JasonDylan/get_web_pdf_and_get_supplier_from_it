Chairman and Chief Executive Officer33  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021Chairman’s Statement
Reinforcing innovation to consolidate the base of the digital economy.  We adhered to driving development 
through sci-tech innovation, and enhanced the layout of the research and development (R&D) system, promoted independent control of core technologies, expedited the transformation of sci-tech achievements. We continued to build intelligent integrated digital information infrastructure that is “high-speed and ubiquitous, aerial-ground in one, cloud-network integrated, intelligent and agile, green and low-carbon, secure and controllable” and built the world’s largest 5G SA co-built and co-shared network, with approximately 690,000 5G base stations in use, and the 5G network covering all cities and counties and certain developed towns across the country. We implemented the all-fibre network upgrade plan and built a new metropolitan network, with the gigabit network covering 160 million residential homes. With the cloud as the core, we made every effort to promote “East-to-West Computing Resource Transfer” and formed the “2+4+31+X+O” resource layout, and built the largest telco-operated cloud in the world. We also consolidated the security foundation of information infrastructure, provided intelligent security services, and built a network security ecosystem.

adaptive to cloud, network and cloud deployed as one, the Company actively promoted network cloudification, and achieved “network deployment following cloud” and one-stop service acceptance. The cloud-network POP (network service provision point) is built adaptive to cloud to achieve simultaneous launch of the standardisation and modularisation of cloud-network capabilities. The backbone core nodes in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau, Guizhou and other regions are migrated to large-scale parks, and key parks are enabled with direct access to the backbone network. With new metropolitan network pilot, large-capacity CUPS vBRAS is deployed in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, where the control plane of service access equipment became cloud-based and the forwarding plane became pool-based to achieve centralised service management and network efficiency enhancement. The Company completed the industry’s first 5GC (5G core network) three-layer decoupling pilot based on its proprietary CT cloud deployment in Shanghai and Sichuan. As cloud-based deployment of traditional network was being promoted, the mastery of cloud-network core technology was also significantly enhanced.
Chengdu branch commenced the operation of the first MEC intelligent edge datacentre in China
In 2021, the first MEC intelligent edge datacentre in 
China independently built by Chengdu branch was put into operation in the Future Medical City, Eastern New District, Chengdu and the network edge sank to the user park synchronously with cloud to realise the localisation of business application data with low latency, so as to enhance the network experience of users.1515 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021Reinforcing Innovation to Consolidate the Base of the Digital Economy

  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021Independent Practitioner’s Assurance Report
2022/SH-0099
(Page 2/3)
Our assurance was with respect to the year ended 31 December 2021 information only and we have not performed any 
procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the 2021 CSR Report.
Criteria
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the selected key data in the 2021 CSR report is set out in notes to the “Table of Indicators” of the 2021 CSR report (the “basis of reporting”), which is based on the “ESG Reporting Guide”, Appendix 27 to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (“Listing Rules”) by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (“HKEx”).
The Board of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the selected key data in the 2021 CSR report in accordance with the “ESG Reporting Guide”, Appendix 27 to the Rules Governing the Listing Rules by HKEx and the basis of reporting. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the selected key data in the 2021 CSR report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirement of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibilities
It is our responsibility to express a conclusion on the selected key data in the 2021 CSR report based on our work.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 
“Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”. This standard requires that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion.76 China Telecom Corporation Limited
Independent Practitioner’s Assurance Report
2022/SH-0099
(Page 3/3)
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent 
than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company’s 2021 selected key data in the 2021 CSR report has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the basis of reporting. Our work involves assessing the risks of material misstatement of the selected key data in the 2021 CSR report whether due to fraud or error, and responding to the assessed risks. The extent of procedures selected depends on our judgment and assessment of the engagement risk. Within the scope of our work, we have performed the following procedures in the Headquarter, Shanghai Branch and Beijing Branch of the Company (we have not conducted work on other locations):
1) Interviews with relevant departments of the Company involved in providing information for the selected key data 
within the CSR Report; and
2) Analytical procedures;3) Examination, on a test basis, of documentary evidence relating to the selected key data on which we report;4) Recalculation; and5) Other procedures deemed necessary.
Inherent Limitation
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities.
Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 2021 selected key data in the 2021 CSR report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the basis of reporting.
Restriction on Use
Our report has been prepared for and only for the board of directors of the Company and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the content of this report.
