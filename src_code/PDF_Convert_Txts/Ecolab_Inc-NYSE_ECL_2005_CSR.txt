strong economic performance, but onresponsible environmental and social
performance as well. Just as we arecommitted to providing quality to our
customers and value to our
shareholders, we are also committed toenvironmental leadership andcontributions to our communities. Our
creative, innovative approaches have led
to breakthrough economic
performances, making us a worldwideindustry leader. We work to attain that
same level of leadership in terms of
sustainability. 
Our annual r epor t to shar eholders
summarize s the financial and marketing
accomplishments and also relates our
ongoing eff orts regarding our
sustainability results. This Ecolab
Sustainabilit y Repor t details how we
have invested resources to ensure thatour business continues to prosper in a
sustainable and responsible manner
within society and within theenvironment. It affirms ourcommitment to corporate
citizenship through leadership in our
industry and gives examples of theactions we have taken in supporting
this position.
As a corporation, either through the
Ecolab Foundation or othercorporate giving programs, wecontributed more than $4.3 million
toward our communities. The
response from our associates to
natural disasters was alsooutstanding. Ecolab volunteers
contributed time and money to
victims of the Gulf Coast hurricanes, andas a company contributed more than $3million w orth of hand and surf ace
sanitizer s and other cleaning products
to the relief efforts. We also providedconsult ation r egar ding ef fective
decon tamination and cleaning protocols.
We are proud of our past successes,both in improving our financial
performance and in environmentalstewardship, but we are determined toachiev e even more. We are working to
improve our already low-impact plantoperations and reduce post-consumer
waste through innovative productdevelopment and packaging. Going
beyond our own operations, we will ask
our strategic suppliers to commit toethical sourcing standards in 2006. 
Our corporate culture reflects our
determination to work toward improvingthe environment, distinguishing Ecolabas a leader in the industry and a leaderin the world. This commitment is clearly
outlined in our adoption of three k ey
business principles of sustainable
business development: stewardship of
the en vironment , contributions to
society and creation of economic value
for our shareholders. We will continueour eff orts by operating with the same
personal int egrit y we apply to all
aspects of our business.

1345Sustainability Management Philosophy
Ecolab has identified environmental, health and safety (EHS) priorities that reflect
our operating “footprint.” The concept of a company’s footprint can be defined as
those areas within EHS where the company’s operations have the greatest potentialeffect on human health and the environment – and where its environmentalprotection and safety efforts can have the greatest benefit. For Ecolab, these areasinclude: • Employ ee safety and w ellness
• Water and energy use
• Waste generation related to packaging and raw materials
Ecolab adopted Environmental Principles to guide its business strategy more than 15
years ago. Ecolab believes that corporations should conduct their business as
responsible stewards of the environment. 
Ecolab applies its Environmental Principles on a global basis. In Europe, for example,
the company has incorporated EHS and quality management systems into an
integrated management system that adheres to the U.N. Sustainable DevelopmentCharter. Ecolab adheres to the charter by applying responsible care principles in
product development, technical operations and service processes at customer sites.
Specific environmental and quality objectives are defined and reviewed in regularbusiness plans, and the European management systems are certified according to
the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards.
Ecolab seeks to continually improve its environmental performance by operating
more efficiently, reducing waste and monitoring the environmental profiles of itsproducts.

Ecolab |Sustainability Report 2005 | 5PRODUC TS AND SYSTEMS
Consistent with our sustainabilityobjectiv
es, we are expanding our
portfolio of “environmentallypreferable” cleaning products. Theseproducts meet environmental attributesrelating to chemistry, packaging,training, dispensing controls and othersustainability factors. 
In Europe, Ecolab sells 16 products
certified by Nordic Swan asenvironmentally preferable. In NorthAmerica, Ecolab launched the 
EcoLogic
line of housekeeping products, including14 products certified by Green Seal.Ecolab is participating in efforts by
Green Seal and Canada’s Environmental
Choice Program to develop a standardfor environmentally preferable hand
cleansers. Likewise, Ecolab is
participating in Green Seal’s efforts todevelop a green cleaning service
standard for building services
contractors. We are also active in theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s
(EPA) Design for the Environment Green
Formulation Initiative to developguidelines for environmentally
preferable raw materials used in
detergent formulations.
OUR SUPPLIERS
We obtain mat erials , supplie
 s,
equipmen t, consulting and other
services at the lowest total cost from
supplier s who are able to meet Ecolab
quality, service and environmentalrequirements. Source selection,
negotiation, determination of contractawards and the administration ofpurchasing activities are ethicallyconducted. We comply with applicablegovernment regulations and companypolicies and procedures.
PACKAGING REDUCTIONOn a glob
al basis, Ecolab works toreduce product packaging. Weintroduced collapsible packaging designsfor several new products in 2005. Byusing flexible pouches instead of rigid
plastic bottles, we have reduced the
amount of plastic introduced into thewaste system. In North America, Ecolab
designs its rigid plastic packaging (less
than 5 gallon size) with more than 15percent post-consumer recycled (PCR)
material. Our goal is to continually
increase this percentage as theavailability of PCR material increases.
SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT DESIGN
In new product development,
en
vironmental impact is evaluated
within our integrated quality and
environmental management system in
Europe and our development process
worldwide. Globally, Ecolab hasexpanded the sale of skin cleansersformulat ed with alk ylpolyglucosides
(APGs ), which are made from nat urally
renewable resources and are
biodegradable without environmental
harm. In addition to these biobased
sustainable ingredients, we have
developed cleaning products with low
alkalinity, low metal ion content and
reduced phosphorus content. New dry
conveyor lubricants reduce ourbeverage plant customers’ wastewatervolume. To help reduce our laundrycustomers’ water and energy impacts,we have implemented the 
Formula 1
laundry system. A typical Formula 1
customer may expect to reduce waterconsumption by over 300,000 gallonsper year. 
As a major initiative for 2005, Ecolab
reviewed and reformulated all detergentproducts sold in Europe with morereadily biodegradable surfactants tomeet new requirements of the EUDetergent Regulation EC/48/2004.  (million pounds) POST -CONSUMER

RELEASES TO THE
AIR/ENVIRONMENT
As required by the U.S. Emergency
Planning and C
ommunity Right-to-Know
Act (EPCRA), Ecolab facilities make
information available about releases of
EPA-listed chemicals to the
environmen t. The primary chemicals
reportable are formula components that
evaporate during production. Over the
past decade, Ecolab’s U.S. production of
cleaning products more than doubled.
At the same time, Ecolab’s releases to
the en vironment (in pounds) in the U.S.
have declined substantially. 
ENERG Y USE
Ecolab strives to maximize the energy
e
fficiency of our products and servicesand minimize the amount of energyconsumed in manufacturing ourproducts. These efforts have a positiveimpact on profitability and help preservenonrenewable energy resources. InNorth America, we used 136 kWH(kilowatt-hour) of natural gas and 79kWH of electricity for each 1,000kilograms of product manufactured; bycomparison, our Europeanmanufacturing utilizes 111 kWH of gasand 45 kWH of electricity tomanufacture 1,000 kilogram of product.
We have initiated a project to
standardize and track these metricsworldwide.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMIS
 SION
Because of our low-impact
manufact uring pr oces
ses, we believe
Ecolab’s greenhouse gas emissions aremodest compared to heavy industry.Nonetheless , Ecolab has joined U.S.
EPA’s Climate Leaders Program. This
cooperative program will help Ecolabdevelop an emissions baseline, a
measurement protocol that can be
utilized globally, and identify
opportunitie s to reduce emissions and
associated costs.CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Ec
olab makes capital investments and
expenditures to help ensure employeesafety and to maintain alignment withour environmental sustainabilityprinciples. Our 2005 capital investmentsfor environmental health and safetyprojects totaled $4.23 million.Approximately $7 million has beenbudgeted globally for projects in 2006.
In addition to these sustainability
investments, Ecolab broke ground on
two new manufacturing plants in
Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Guangzhou,China. These plants have been designed
to comply with local regulations and will
utiliz e best environmental practices
from other Ecolab facilities.

well as telecommuting.
• Protecting/restoring open space and habitats through water efficient landscaping, eliminating alien plants and planting indigenous
species, re-establishing nature 
trails, and installing bluebird and wood-duck houses.
• Moving to more efficient lighting, reducing/eliminating mercury lighting, and installing personnel 
sensors to control lighting.
• Participating in source reduction 
and waste management through 
storage and collection of 
recyclables.
• Committing to green cleaning and 
low environmental impact pest 
management.
EHS AUDITING AND C
 OMPLIANCE
To ensure Ecolab’s EHS compliance in
manuf act
uring operations, North
American facilities are audited by a thirdparty consultant every other year.Similarly , in E urope and Australia, an
outside EHS consultant audits our
plants. In addition, audits are performed
when f acilitie s are ac quired.
Furthermore, Ecolab’s property and
casualty insurers conduct fire and
worker safety assessments and pressure
vessel certifications at Ecolab facilities.
These auditing programs help us

CUSTOMER SAFETY RIGHT-TO-KNOW
As a major sustainability goal for 2005, Ecolab committed in last year’s Sustainability
R
eport to expand our global customer safety data sheet support in more local
languages. Ecolab delivered on this goal with 15,000+ new multilingual safety data
sheets. 
Ecolab provides Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) with health and safety
information about each product to assist customers in handling Ecolab
product s safely . In 2 005, Ecolab invested in implementing a new global MSDS
authoring system in Australia, Europe and North America that will help
provide up-to-date, consistent safety information in the local language, and
in complianc e with tightening r egulat ory requirements for MSDS. This system
will help our c ustomers receive current safety information in their preferred
language. 
In addition, Ecolab utilized the system to help meet new requirements
relating to ingredient disclosures to medical personnel under the European
Detergent Regulation. 
REDUCING PESTICIDE USEEcolab Pest Elimination is committed to providing our customers withs
ervices that help protect their facilities, their brands and their customers from the
damaging effects of pests. We focus on utilizing holistic pest control systems that
minimize pesticide usage. Our innovative approach includes the patented Stealth fly
trap – a pesticide-free system that blends with facility décor to inconspicuously
eliminate flies. Similarly, our ECO2000 Program includes proprietary baits that
control cockroaches while reducing pesticide usage. Our ProGuard Pest Exclusion
service is a non-pesticide approach that reduces entry of pests by eliminating accesspoints for pests. 
OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES (ODS)
Ec
olab has eliminated all ozone-depleting substances (such as CFC propellants) from
its cleaning product lines. For pest elimination fumigation of food storage facilities,
Ecolab is working on alternatives to reduce use of methyl bromide. While Ecolab’sfumigation business has grown in recent years with our expansion into the UnitedKingdom, Ecolab has reduced methyl bromide by 40 percent compared to levels prior

intrinsic worth and dignity of each associate.
INCLUSION, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY AND
AFFIRMA
TIVE ACTION
We are c ommit t ed to a culture that fully leverages our
associates’ talents by promoting an environment where allassociates can make a difference, be heard, be supported,
and be developed and rewarded for their contributions.
Ecolab is committed to fair and equal treatment of associates
and applicants. Associates and applicants for employment areevaluated on a non-discriminatory basis. In all matters
affecting employment of associates, including hiring,
compensation and promotions, decisions will be made on the
basis of qualifications and performance.Ecolab has in place a proactive set ofprograms in order to ensure that we
meet our objective to provide equalemploymen t opportunity. In addition,
Ecolab is committed to furthering the
principles of equal employmentoppor tunity through affirmative action.
WORKPLACE RESPECTRe
spect for each other is basic to theEcolab culture. Regardless of where itoccurs, behavior that disrupts theproductive work environment of our
associates threatens the teamwork vitalto Ecolab’s success. All associates are
expected to help ensure that our work
environment is respectful and free fromabusive behavior and harassment.Behavior that violates this policy mustbe reported and addressed.
In 2005, Ecolab expanded use of the Aquamiser technology from E urope

cannot take time to work safely. Safetyis not to be sacrificed in the name of
customer service or quantity and
quality of production. Appropriate plant,
division and corporate metrics will be
created, maintained and reported tomanagement in order to monitor
current safety levels, associated safetytrends and to determine programimprovements or remedial actions.
The Associate Safety Program was re-
introduced to U.S. associates in August2005. The key components of thisindustry best practice program include:• Management support and structure
• Performance metrics
• Coordinated communication
• Personal protective equipment
• Slip-resistant footwear
• Targeted safety training
• Prevention of muscle strain injuries
• Prevention of slip, trip and fall injuries
• Manager safety coaching
These key components of the program
will be introduced on a global basis
during 2006 and 2007 to augmentexisting pr ograms at int ernational
locations.
DRIVER S AFETY
Since it was intr
 oduced in the United
States in 2003, the enhanced DriverSafety Program has reduced vehicle-
related accident rates and the accident
cost per vehicle by signif icant amount s.
Approximat ely 1,400 drivers have
completed the day-long driver safety
program that consists of classroom
and behind-the-wheel training.
The program is also now
operational in Canada.Our goal is continuous
improvement asmeasured by a
reduction both in thenumber of injuries andtheir seriousness.Our U.S. Safety Index

CHARITABLE GIVING
Ecolab has a strong history of giving back to
c
ommunities where our associates live and work. We
believe it benefits the economic and social vitality ofthese communities; we believe this also enables us toattract the talent we need to continue our business
growth and development. We support organizations
and programs that strengthen and enrich thecommunity , especially in the areas of youth and
educ ation, civic and c ommunit y development, arts and
culture, environment and conservation andcommunity-bas ed giving. T hrough the Ecolab
Foundation alone, we annually contribute 1.2 percent of
our U.S. pretax earnings to domestic charitable
organizations . In addition, our businesses contribute to
a number of educational, civic and community
progr ams across the United St ates. In 2005, our total
giving exceeded $4.3 million dollars to ourcommunities, and over $1 million of that was investedin educational programs supporting youth. Over the
past 10 years, Ecolab has contributed more than $30million to our communities with these efforts. Oursupport doesn’t end there. During times of natural
disaster we have donated millions of dollars worth of
sanitizing solutions, helping to serve those in need. ECOL AB FOU NDATION GIVING 2 005

Approximately 50 percent of donations in this category are allocated to supportyouth education in the area of conservation and the environment.

Students from the school helped install 25 bluebird housesand assisted in the removal of invasive buckthorn bushes on our Allan L. SchumanCampus in Eagan, Minn. 
Among the organizations we support
are the Nature Conservancy, a leading
international, nonprofit organization
dedicated to preserving the diversity of
life on earth; the Deep Portage
Environmental Learning Center; and theTrust for Public Land, which conserves
land for people to enjoy as parks,
gardens and other natural places,ensuring livable communities across the
United States for generations to come.  
We have made multi-year commitments
to support long-term projects across

whose sole commitment is protection
and preservation of the environment.
Ecolab associates also understand that
they are part of a community that ismuch larger than their local facilities,
and many take their personal time tovolunteer and serve on boards fororganizations that share theirphilosophy, defending and conservingthe en vironment.
