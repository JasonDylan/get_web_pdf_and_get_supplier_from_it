Environmental, Social, Governance  
 (ESG) and Sustainability Report
SECTION 1:  
QUALITATIVE INFORMATION
Introduction
CMS Energy and our primary subsidiary, Consumers Energy, 
have integrated sustainable principles throughout our company. 
Our commitment to the triple bottom line — people, planet and 
prosperity — is our foundation. As Michigan’s largest utility, 
consideration of environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) issues is embedded in our 
strategy, business planning and enterprise risk 
management processes. These commitments 
align with our purpose: World Class 
Performance Delivering Hometown Service. 
The triple bottom line balances the interests 
of all stakeholders, including co-workers, 
customers, suppliers, regulators, Michigan residents and the 
investment community.
CMS Energy is participating in a voluntary industry initiative, 
coordinated by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and the American 
Gas Association (AGA), to provide the public, our customers and 
shareholders uniform and consistent ESG and sustainability-
related metrics. This report supplements our existing disclosure 
on these issues, including our 2019 Sustainability Report and 
our sustainability website . You can find more stories about our 
sustainability efforts and the people who are making a real and 
positive impact for Michigan here .
At CMS Energy, we 
know  climate change 
is happening and  
we can do our part 
to care for the  
planet by focusing 
on a clean and lean  
operating strategy.2020   •  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  •  CMS ENERGY & CONSUMERS ENERGY   •  2
ENVIRONMENT
Climate Change
In the past five years, Consumers Energy has created a cleaner, 
more sustainable energy future for Michigan by taking a leadership 
position in reducing air emissions, water use and landfill waste. 
“Our actions speak louder than words and we have a track record 
of doing more than is required. Our actions to date have reduced 
our carbon emissions by over 35 percent, reduced our water use by 
over 40 percent and avoided over one million cubic yards of landfill 
disposal,” said Patti Poppe, president and CEO of CMS Energy and 
Consumers Energy.
But we are not satisfied. In February 2020, Consumers Energy 
announced a goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040 
for our electric generation business, 
the next step in an industry-leading 
Clean Energy Plan  that protects the planet 
for future generations. This carbon-
reduction goal is one of the nation’s most 
aggressive among similarly sized utilities. Consumers Energy is 
embracing a cleaner and leaner vision, focused on eliminating 
wasted energy and adding more renewable energy sources such as 
wind and solar.
In addition to our efforts to reduce the electric utility’s carbon 
footprint, we are also helping to reduce the gas utility’s methane 
footprint. In 2019, Consumers Energy set an industry-leading goal 
of net zero methane emissions from its natural gas delivery system 
by 2030 as outlined in our Methane Reduction Plan . 
We plan to reduce methane emissions from our system about 80 
percent by replacing aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated 
infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. 
Remaining emissions will be eliminated by purchasing and/or 
producing renewable natural gas, which offsets greenhouse gases by 
capturing emissions that would otherwise go to the atmosphere.
Renewable Energy
As outlined in our Clean Energy Plan approved by Michigan’s 
Public Service Commission in 2019, we plan to add 550 megawatts 
of wind to help us reach Michigan’s 15 percent renewable energy

standard by the end of 2021. We plan to add capacity 
incrementally, allowing flexibility in planning and resource 
type to adapt to changing conditions. We’re planning to 
add over 6,000 megawatts of solar energy with a ramp-up 
throughout the 2020s to prepare for the retirement of certain 
fossil fuel-fired units, and the end of some power purchase 
agreements. The additional solar capacity may be a mix of 
owned and purchased.
The Clean Energy Plan forecasts renewable energy levels of:
 • 25 percent by 2025.
 • 42 percent by 2030.
 • 56 percent by 2040.
This plan would help us reduce carbon 
emissions from owned generation 
by more than 90 percent from 2005 
levels. Since 2005, Consumers Energy’s 
renewable capacity has grown from 
3 percent to over 12 percent. We look 
forward to this percentage continuing 
to grow as we transition from coal to 
renewables in support of our Clean 
Energy Plan. We own and operate two 
wind farms: Lake Winds Energy Park in Mason County and Cross 
Winds Energy Park in Tuscola County.
In addition to our existing wind farms, our recent efforts to develop 
new renewable energy sources include:
•  Building the 150-megawatt (MW) Gratiot Farms Wind Project 
in Gratiot County and entering into an agreement to purchase 
the 166-MW Crescent Wind Project in Hillsdale County. Both 
projects are in development and are expected to begin commercial 
operations in late 2020. 
•  Agreeing to purchase 100 MW of renewable capacity and energy 
from a solar facility to be constructed in Calhoun County and 
expected to be operational in 2022.
•  Procuring substantial new solar capacity through a competitive 
bidding process, including 300 MW to be online in 2022, another 
300 MW in 2023, and another 500 MW in 2024.
•  Purchasing 584 MW of power from solar qualifying facilities 
generation by 2023.

100 percent clean energy, helping businesses achieve their 
corporate sustainability goals.
Waste Reduction and Energy Efficiency
Consumers Energy continues its long history of promoting energy 
waste reduction and energy efficiency. Energy waste reduction is an 
important part of our efforts to build a more sustainable future for 
Michigan. 
“Reducing energy waste is good for people, the planet and 
Michigan’s prosperity by saving money for household budgets, 
reducing carbon emissions and putting people to work,” said 
Brian Rich, Consumers Energy’s Senior Vice President and Chief 
Customer Officer.
In 2019, Consumers Energy’s energy waste reduction program 
helped customers save nearly $600,000 on their energy bills, 
boosting our total customer savings since 2009 to $3.1 billion and 
preventing nearly 9 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. 
The energy savings delivered in 2019 by our residential programs 
represents enough savings to supply electricity to 23,000 homes and 
natural gas to 14,000 homes for a year.
Recognizing these efforts, Consumers Energy received the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency 2019 Energy STAR® Partner of 
the Year Sustained Excellence Award. Consumers Energy’s Clean 
Energy Plan also maintains energy waste reduction as a key to 
reducing the company’s carbon emissions for years to come.
Electric Vehicle Support:  
PowerMIDrive Program
In 2019, Consumers Energy launched its PowerMIDrive program, 
a three-year pilot, to help customers realize the economic and 
environmental benefits of electric vehicles (EVs) by expanding 
charging and grid capabilities.

Since the program launched, we increased EV charging capabilities 
and public charging infrastructure across our electric service 
territory, including:
•  Awarding 314 home charger rebates and 120 FleetCarma C2 
incentives to residential participants. 
•  Awarding 85 of a planned 200 public level 2 EV charger rebates.
•  Awarding, in a partnership with the Michigan Department of 
Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), 6 of a planned 36 
Direct Current Fast Charger rebates, all in different cities.
Consumers Energy also enrolled more than 500 customers in a new 
time-of-use EV rate, which provides lowering rates for off-peak 
EV charging. Initial residential load profile data showed this rate’s 
effectiveness, with 90 percent of charging occurring off-peak on 
weekdays and over 75 percent off-peak charging on weekends. 
Water Use Reduction,  
Landfill Waste Reduction  
and Land Protections
Consumers Energy has made great strides in reducing its impact 
on other key parts of the environment, including our water use. 
For example, we reduced our water use by nearly 50% after retiring 
seven coal-fired generation units in 2016 known as the Classic 
Seven. 
Also in 2018, Consumers Energy began working toward the 
following five-year targets: 
 • Save 1 billion gallons of water.
 • Enhance, restore or protect 5,000 acres of land in Michigan.
 • Reduce waste sent to landfills by 35 percent.
As of 2019, Consumers Energy made significant progress on each of 
its goals to protect the environment and reduce carbon footprint:
 • Reduced water usage by over 400 million gallons.
 • Enhanced, restored, or protected over 2,200 acres of land.
 • Reduced the amount of waste taken to landfills by 10 percent.

SOCIAL
Our Culture
We enable our co-workers to live the values of our 
company culture: caring, empowered, deliberate, agility 
and ownership. This includes caring for our co-workers 
and the communities we serve. In addition to focusing on 
ESG-related issues in our core business, we leverage our 
corporate giving initiatives and employee volunteerism to 
focus on people, planet and prosperity.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees and the public is 
always a top priority. We have worked hard to improve our 
safety culture and performance which has resulted in a 
70-percent decrease in safety incidents since 2008. Edison 
Electric Institute (EEI) ranked Consumers Energy in the 
top quartile for utility standards and safety performance. 
However, we remain dedicated to our goal of zero safety 
incidents and have partnered with EEI to develop a new 
proactive risk-based safety model. The model will allow 
us to ensure we have controls in place to prevent serious 
injuries or fatalities. We are also continuing to focus on 
cyber security and have a dedicated team focused on 
detecting and responding to threats in close coordination 
with state and federal partners.
Human Rights
CMS Energy respects human rights. All co-workers are 
expected to be strong ethical community partners — 
forming positive relationships wherever we do business. 
We are committed to valuing and respecting human 
rights across our operations and to conduct business 
in a way that leaves a positive impact on people and the 
communities we serve. Our Human Rights Policy  further 
details our commitment.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
We are committed to creating a world where all people are:
• Respected and included.
• Valued for their unique qualities and abilities.
• Treated fairly.
• Afforded the opportunity to advance.
Realizing this vision requires re-examining our business operations 
to consider how decisions impact diversity, equity and inclusion 
(DE&I) for our co-workers, our customers and the communities  
we serve.
We’re building a world-class, inclusive workforce and customer 
experience by embedding diversity, equity and inclusion into 
everything we do. That means deliberately evaluating how 
we recruit, hire, retain, lead, reward and develop co-workers, 
empowering all to embody DE&I.
We connect DE&I standards to our corporate values: Caring, 
Empowered, Deliberate, Agility and Ownership. We make them 
integral to all we do, from improving the co-worker experience 
to ensuring alignment and engagement with our customers and 
suppliers as we equitably support our communities.
These efforts, which recently led Forbes Magazine to name us 
Best Employer for Women in the utility sector and one of the best 
employers in Michigan, include:
•  Created a virtual safety and inclusion “tailboard” to use before 
all remote work meetings, reminding co-workers how to keep 
themselves and their colleagues physically and emotionally safe.
•  Established Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to encourage 
collaboration, support inclusion and provide community for 
co-workers who are: women, minorities, LGBTQ+, veterans, 
differently abled and multi-generational.
•  Changed our parental leave policy to allow birthing mothers six 
months (24 weeks) paid leave, and a four-month (16 weeks) paid 
leave to a non-birthing parent. 
•  Appointed Angela Thompkins as Vice President & Chief Diversity 
Officer to set and monitor our diversity, equity and inclusion 
(DE&I) strategy.
2020   •  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  •  CMS ENERGY & CONSUMERS ENERGY   •  8
We’re also serving as a driving force for good by implementing 
a holistic DE&I strategy focusing on co-workers, customers, 
communities and shareholders. Our recent efforts include:
•  Donated $100,000 in grants to support the Black Lives Matter 
movement, fight racism, shape systemic change and create 
opportunities in Michigan.
•  Helped lead efforts to add gender identity and sexual 
orientation to the list of protected classes under the state’s 
Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act.
•  Supported non-discrimination and anti-racism efforts in Jackson, 
our hometown and the site of our corporate headquarters.
•  Committed to increasing supplier diversity and our spending with 
Michigan-based and minority-owned businesses.
Michigan’s Prosperity
We have taken on several initiatives to grow our local economy 
and resources. We are committed to improving workforce training 
in Michigan by aligning education and training resources across 
the state and by raising awareness of career pathways in the 
energy industry. We are also supporters and advocates for science, 
technology, engineering and math education in the state, which 
is important for Michigan to attract great talent. The Consumers 
Energy Foundation provides monetary contributions to a variety of 
educational programs and other programs that support the success 
of small businesses. Additionally, Consumers Energy is committed 
to spending $7.5 billion with Michigan-based suppliers over a five-
year period that started in June 2019 as part of the Pure Michigan 
Business Connect initiative. All these efforts, and more, help boost 
Michigan’s prosperity.
Our COVID-19 Response
The company has taken many steps to protect our co-workers and 
customers from the spread of COVID-19 and to help those directly 
affected. In alignment with Centers for Disease Control guidelines 
and the orders and rules from the State of Michigan, we have 
changed customer interactions to promote health and safety. We are 
also equipping our frontline co-workers with appropriate personal 
protective equipment and adjusting employee policies to provide 
better support. In addition, we have made emotional well-being of 
all employees a top priority during this difficult time.
2020   •  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  •  CMS ENERGY & CONSUMERS ENERGY   •  9
We’ve also created a $12 million fund to help Michigan residents 
and small businesses struggling to pay their energy bills due 
to COVID 19, providing a lifeline to help those in need stay on 
their feet. Consumers Energy has set a goal to help about 25,000 
households and 1,000 small businesses with this new assistance. 
Learn more here  and please see our Emergency Response webpage  
for additional information. 
Consumers Energy Foundation
Since 1990, the Consumers Energy Foundation  has provided grants 
and mobilized volunteers to strengthen local education, social 
services, the environment and community, economic and cultural 
development. Since 2009, the Foundation has donated more than 
$44 million, and Consumers Energy has donated an additional $69 
million – for a combined amount of $110 million. 
Foundation giving is separate from other company contributions 
and cannot be used to directly benefit the corporation.
The foundation is funded by company donations not included 
in customer rates, along with contributions from employee and 
retirees to support nonprofit organizations across Michigan, to 
help cultivate sustainable communities. In 2019, the company 
donated $11.5 million to Michigan nonprofits. This support went to 
organizations and efforts that help people, protect the planet and 
promote prosperity:
 • People: $6 million
 • Planet: $1.3 million
 • Prosperity: $4.2 million 
As of October 2020, the Foundation gave about $5 million focused 
on emergency and COVID-19 relief, in addition to the $12 million 
fund focused specifically on COVID-19 discussed above. Learn more 
about how our foundation is helping during the pandemic here .
In addition, the spirit of giving goes beyond our corporate 
donations as Consumers Energy’s president and CEO, Patti Poppe, 
made a personal commitment during the early days of the COVID-
19 pandemic to donate $1 million to help small businesses in the 
company’s hometown of Jackson, Mich. Poppe and her husband, 
Eric, made the donation to the Jackson Community Foundation 
2020   •  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  •  CMS ENERGY & CONSUMERS ENERGY   •  10
to create a separate fund known as the Dream Maker Small 
Business Emergency Relief Fund. More information is available at 
www.DreamMakerFund.org .
Volunteerism
Our company has a long history of supporting active co-worker 
volunteerism in a variety of areas. The company targets key 
volunteer opportunities that make a difference — in 2019 alone, 
our co-workers recorded more than 16,000 volunteer hours at 570 
Michigan nonprofits. These events included park and waterway 
cleanups during Earth Month, youth robotics competitions and 
community and neighborhood revitalization activities.
Governance
CMS Energy and Consumers Energy have multiple levels of 
sustainability oversight integrated into daily operations. We use 
several governance and risk-management tools when addressing 
ESG and sustainability matters. These include oversight by the 
CMS Energy and Consumers Energy board of directors (board), 
an enterprise risk management program, and robust strategic and 
business planning processes.
The board is comprised of directors with experience and knowledge 
of ESG and sustainability issues and has the highest level of 
oversight over our ESG and sustainability practices. Review of these 
practices occurs at the board level by the:
• Audit Committee 
• Governance, Sustainability and Public Responsibility Committee
• Compensation and Human Resources Committee
The Audit Committee oversees our enterprise risk management 
framework, which includes strategic and operational risks, as well 
as the processes, guidelines and policies for identifying, assessing 
monitoring and mitigating such risks.
Risk management is embedded into business processes and key 
decisions at all levels of the company. The Governance Committee 
is responsible for reviewing and evaluating the composition of 
the board, recommending board nominees, broadly overseeing 
the corporate governance and advising and assisting the board on 
public responsibility and sustainability matters.
2020   •  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  •  CMS ENERGY & CONSUMERS ENERGY   •  11
Acknowledging the growing importance of sustainability and 
climate-related matters, the board in 2018 formally tasked 
the Governance, Sustainability and Public Responsibility 
Committee with oversight of sustainability practices by adding 
this responsibility to its charter. The Compensation Committee is 
responsible for our executive compensation structure, benefit and 
compensation plans and critical human resource programs. The 
committee charters can be found at CMSEnergy.com .
We also have an Environment & Sustainability Council (E&SC), 
comprised of senior leadership that influences our environmental 
compliance and sustainability programs and governs decisions that 
support our commitment to the planet. This includes short- and 
long-term strategic decisions pertaining to environmental issues 
including climate and ESG disclosure reporting. 
In addition to a robust oversight structure, CMS Energy has an 
enterprise risk management (ERM) program to ensure risks that 
may significantly impact the business are known and understood 
and inform risk-mitigation strategies. The scope, objectives and 
roles and responsibilities related to the ERM program are included 
in the company’s corporate risk policy, which is approved by 
the board’s audit committee. The ERM program covers risks for 
CMS Energy and its subsidiaries across several areas: strategic, 
operational, regulatory, environmental, financial, information 
technology operations and cyber security.
One area addressed through our risk program is the physical 
impacts of climate change. The company has a cross-functional 
team to discuss these potential impacts on our assets and how to 
address those issues in a cost-effective manner. 
Strategy and Integration
Internal and external data sources are leveraged as input into our 
long-term strategic planning. This data is analyzed and synthesized 
into an update on trends critical to our current and future business. 
This data influences multiple areas of our strategy including 
distributed energy resources, wholesale markets, customer energy 
usage trends and climate policy. This information is used to assess 
our strategic choices and underlying assumptions. The senior team 
and board engage with the insights from this work throughout 
the year to evaluate the strategic choices and test for potential new 
opportunities or threats.
2020   •  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  •  CMS ENERGY & CONSUMERS ENERGY   •  12
Stakeholder Engagement
We spend significant time and effort listening to our customers and 
key stakeholders before making decisions. Our long-term resource 
plans and our environmental and sustainability strategies consider 
people, the planet and prosperity. In 2017 and 2018, for example, we 
engaged stakeholders in developing our Clean Energy Breakthrough 
Goals and our Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) filing. This 
engagement included a series of widely promoted public forums to 
give stakeholders an opportunity to provide input on our long-term 
resource plans. These forums were designed as informational and 
educational sessions with the chance to offer comments and ask 
questions about topics such as renewable energy, energy efficiency 
and emerging technology. In 2019, we met with a group of Michigan 
environmental nonprofit organizations to discuss our progress 
towards Clean Energy Breakthrough Goals and collect feedback. 
We are hosting similar stakeholder engagement activities as part of 
our 2021 IRP development.
We also have an ongoing outreach program to develop and 
maintain communication with our shareholders. We value these 
discussions, and the board considers feedback when evaluating 
corporate governance issues. Management regularly participates in 
shareholder and industry conferences to discuss performance and 
ESG topics. Shareholders, co-workers and third parties may contact 
the board with any inquiry or issue by the methods described on 
our website. The board will respond as appropriate.
Other Resources
We provide extensive public reporting in disclosures about ESG and 
sustainability, including our environmental stewardship and long-
term strategy. We address these matters in Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Environmental Protection Agency and other 
regulatory agency filings, and by voluntarily reporting efforts such 
as our CDP Climate Report and CDP Water Report. CMS Energy 
also published a Climate Assessment Report in November 2018.
We continually update and enhance disclosures relating to 
sustainability efforts on our website and in our Sustainability 
Report, which provide a better understanding of the breadth and 
depth of our climate-related planning and practices and can be 
found here .
