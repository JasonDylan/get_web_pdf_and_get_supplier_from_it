Introduction
032021 Environmental, 
Social and Governance ReportAdapting For Our Customers  
We have positioned our company to accelerate 
highway-to-rail freight conversion, driven by 
technological innovation, operating efficiency and 
dependable service. With our investments in network 
capacity, advanced technologies that respond to 
sustainability demands and new service offerings, 
CSX continued to deliver for our customers and 
expand our service to meet our customers where, 
when and how they need us most. 
In 2021, this included important improvements  
to existing customer offerings — such as an 
enhancement to our XGate system that reduces 
potential emissions — and strategic business 
development and growth initiatives — including an 
agreement to acquire Pan Am Systems, which will 
expand CSX’s reach to provide best-in-class service  
to new and existing customers. 
Evolving For Our Employees  
Thanks to our talented team, CSX was prepared 
and ready to meet challenges that arose throughout 
the year. Our employees demonstrated their 
commitment to CSX’s guiding principles and our 
unified service culture time and time again. 
When the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted 
train crew availability, we implemented an intense 
hiring initiative for operating employees. When 
supply chain congestion caused backups at ocean 
ports, our employees leveraged the resiliency of  
our operating model to respond quickly to 
challenging conditions. 
Our employees continue to show pride in the 
work they do and in being part of an essential 
transportation company – and for that I am  
both humbled and greatly appreciative. 
To each and every one of you, thank you for 
everything you do.Innovating For Our Planet  
In 2021, CSX was once again recognized at a  
national and global level for our commitment 
to sustainability and our efforts to drive carbon 
emissions reductions throughout the supply chain. 
We remain dedicated to advancing innovative 
solutions and progressive action in our operations  
to reduce our impact on the environment while 
working closely with our customers to help them 
improve their carbon footprint. 
Last year, our customers doubled their use of  
CSX tools that helped them calculate emissions 
savings by switching to rail. By choosing to use CSX 
rail instead of shipping by truck, they collectively 
avoided 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions, the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars  
off the road.
Positioning CSX For Growth  
Taking our operational transformation to the 
next level, we are now shifting into growth mode 
as we leverage our improved safety, efficiency 
and sustainability. CSX strengthened its value 
to customers and the United States economy 
in 2021 with sustained momentum across key 
growth initiatives. Moving forward, we are focused 
on expanding our network capacity to continue 
delivering excellent customer service while executing 
our new "One CSX" culture transformation.
In our pursuit to be the transportation solution 
of choice, we remain committed to strengthen 
our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
performance and we will continue to adapt, evolve 
and innovate. I am energized by the growth and 
success I know CSX will achieve.

on the health and safety of our employees and strengthening

across our workforce, customers and industry peers. 
CSX proudly achieved industry-leading safety 
performance in 2021, thanks to our workforce-
wide effort to foster a safety culture grounded in a 
shared sense of ownership and accountability. Our 
focus was steadfast on maintaining critical rules 
compliance while enhancing technologies, training 
and awareness programs that reinforce positive 
safety behaviors throughout the organization. 
We also focused on how we best position our 
operations for long-term growth, including 
optimizing network and terminal capacity while 
maintaining and improving existing infrastructure.  
In 2021, we invested $1.4 billion in critical 
infrastructure improvements to ensure safety  
across tracks, bridges, signals and equipment.Safety Tracking &  
Management
Daily safety performance is tracked through our 
Public Safety, Health and Environment (PSH&E) 
Management System and informed by major 
elements of ISO 14001. In addition to ongoing 
outreach and awareness campaigns, trainings 
and rigorous emergency preparedness practices 
throughout the year, we conduct a comprehensive 
industry risk assessment on an annual basis in 
partnership with the Association of American 
Railroads (AAR). 
All employees, regardless of job function or level,  
are part of the CSX Safety team. While our Chief 
Safety Officer maintains the highest level of 
oversight of the safety program, our Executive  Safety Council is responsible for local engagement 
efforts, including increasing regional-level  
leadership engagement and involvement in  
CSX’s system-wide safety plan. 
Safety metrics such as FRA Personal Injury 
Frequency Index and Train Accident Rate are 
included as components of our Management 
Incentive Compensation Plan (MICP),

No Lifechanging Events 
At CSX, we are committed to cultivating a safety-
focused culture with zero incidents. We want each 
and every CSX employee to return home safely 
every day. To achieve this, we proactively identify 
risks, initiate action to mitigate those risks and work 
collaboratively to keep each other safe.
In 2021, for the first time in five years, CSX recorded 
zero employee fatalities and zero amputations.  
We attribute this to our “no fatalities or life-changing 
events” campaign, which included a video to 
engage and educate employees on our commitment 
to safety. Across all divisions, leadership has 
shown their support for and focus on making this 
commitment a reality. 
In December 2021, an explosion occurred at the 
CSX Coal Pier in Curtis Bay, Baltimore. Thanks to 
the swift and diligent work by the Baltimore Office 
of Emergency Management, Baltimore Police 
Department, Baltimore City Fire Department and 
CSX, all employees were accounted for and no 
injuries were reported. CSX remains committed to 
taking further action to prevent future accidents like 
this from happening again. 
With hundreds of new employees scheduled to 
be onboarded into the CSX workforce throughout 
2022, safety must remain a priority focus. As these 
employees enter an organization that leads the 
industry in safety, it is imperative that they are 
exposed to impactful and memorable education 
and training programs that instill a comprehensive 
understanding of risk.2019 2020 20211.002.00

Safety
Safety T ools & T echnology
Technology is critical to all aspects of CSX’s 
operations — and safety is no exception. We 
anticipate growth in global demand for quick, 
efficient freight services in the years to come.  
To meet this demand while maintaining high levels  
of safety performance, technology must become 
even more integrated, automated and efficient.  
We invest in technological innovations that can 
detect and avoid many types of human factor 
incidents and use data to identify risks and improve 
risk-based decisions. 
CSX uses a number of tools and technologies to  
drive meaningful performance improvements, 
including increased service agility, reliability and, 
most importantly, safety. 
Asset Monitoring & Detection T echnology  
In 2021, we finished upgrading our access control 
system, including our one badge system. These 
updates have provided considerable safety benefits 
and allowed us to consolidate our cameras into one 
platform that is more in line with other systems 
across CSX departments, including Human 
Resources. Our one badge system is now linked 
to employee status (whether active or inactive) 
within the company, allowing for increased safety 
measures and visibility. 
The CSX access control system additionally 
allows for automated reporting relating to system 
outages, maintenance issues and other notable and time-sensitive occurrences. This has strengthened 
our overall cybersecurity efforts, preventing 
cyber issues from impacting our asset monitoring 
initiatives. 
Moving forward, we plan to bring infrastructure 
cameras up to speed with our systems and 
coordinate with police departments for increased 
visibility into our tracks. We are currently rebuilding 
the camera located at West Point Military 
Academy, serving as a pilot project that will enable 
us to share live feeds with West Point’s command 
center and refine the technology for expanded 
implementation. Autonomous Track Assessment Cars 
Autonomous track assessment cars (ATACs) 
have the ability to gather critical data measuring 
track efficiencies and are vital to CSX’s safety 
operations. The data collected by ATACs, which are 
essentially converted boxcars, is sent in near real-
time to a vendor for review within CSX’s inspection 
system. The information is processed to detect 
defects, repairs and remediation. 
Because of ATAC, we are better equipped to 
understand related track deterioration and take 
swift action accordingly. In 2021, we focused 
efforts on core routes and plan to move to 
secondary routes as we look to increase our three 
ATAC cars to eight in 2022.

Social and Governance ReportSafety
Drones 
CSX has demonstrated significant progress with 
drone technology following the successful use of 
autonomous drones to optimize yard inspections 
and inventory processes in 2020. At the end of 
2021, we began using Airdata — an operation 
platform that provides flight performance data 
— to determine the length of time drones could 
operate in the air. We are now able to see and track 
how often a drone is being utilized on a monthly 
basis. We plan to continue this focus in the coming 
year to monitor access to our properties and assets. 
We also placed an emphasis on piloting infrared 
and night-vision drones to allow for 24/7 execution, 
including purchasing three night-vision drones and 
evaluating long-term use, specifically for flying 
over inspection areas to improve the safety and 
efficiency of our operations. Mobile Tablets
CSX has equipped nearly 10,000 of our train, 
engine, mechanical and engineering employees 
with mobile tablets that enable them to perform 
their duties more effectively and safely. These 
tablets allow for daily electronic access to 
necessary documents including rulebooks, notices, 
timetables and dispatcher bulletins, which help to 
drive efficiencies and modernize CSX’s work tools 
across the business. Mobile technology continues 
to be an area of growth for CSX as we look to 
supply additional departments with tablets and 
promote the digitization of safety operations.

Positive Train Control 
Positive Train Control (PTC) is a nationwide system 
designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, 
derailments and other accidents. PTC system 
reliability has remained a foremost priority for CSX. 
We maintained 100 percent PTC interoperability 
across our network in 2021, enforcing speed and 
signal compliance to ensure the safety of our rails 
and the communities where we operate. 
Train Inspection Portal  
CSX launched our second Train Inspection Portal 
(TIP) in 2021. With this industry pioneering 
software, we can identify train problems while in 
transit. The advanced machine vision technology 
identifies defects and automatically flags cars 
for repair using ultra-high-definition cameras and 
high-powered illumination to produce 360-degree 
scans of railcars passing through the portal at track 
speed. Vendor IS Network 
CSX uses IS Network (ISN), an automated vendor 
network, as a critical resource to confirm access 
for vendors and contractors that work on CSX 
property. ISN allows for the implementation of a 
robust system that provides insight into vendor
and contractor companies and the people these 
companies are putting on our property. 
We encourage training through this network to our 
vendors, contractors and third-party groups. The 
network grades contractors by previous safety 
records — if the contractor or vendor receives a 
grade of C or below, they are required to meet as a 
group with the department lead in charge of hiring 
to develop a variance plan, allowing for greater 
visibility into who is on our property with access to 
reliable background verification. “At CSX, we only sell service, nothing else. The data  
and the images we receive from our two Train Inspection 
Portals provide advanced notifications of issues that may 
cause blockage or effect track integrity. We’re investing in  
this technology that has the ability to stop service failures 
before they happen while growing our customer base and  
value proposition.”

Employee & Community Education & 
Safety Training 
Education continues to prove paramount in 
protecting the lives and health of CSX railroaders, 
customers and the communities we serve. By 
disseminating impactful information through 
comprehensive engagement programs, we play 
a lead role in encouraging and motivating safe 
behavior on and near railroad tracks. 
Examples of employee and community training 
and education programs launched or expanded in 
2021 include:
Emergency Responder Training & Education 
Assistance  
The Public Safety Coordination Center (PSCC) 
is our central communications hub, coordinating 
first responders and dispatchers around the clock. 
PSCC manages reports of railroad incidents such 
as blocked crossings, crossing collisions, signal 
malfunctions, materials released, theft, vandalism 
or trespassing to ensure all issues are promptly 
resolved. In addition to ongoing communication 
and coordination, CSX offers training to provide 
first responders with the necessary information, 
experience and coordination of resources to 
respond effectively in the event of an incident or 
emergency. 
Building on the momentum gained in 2020, this 
past year, CSX leveraged a combination of effective 
virtual and hands-on training to successfully train first responders through its newly constructed 
Responder Incident Training (RIT) railcar. RIT 
provides critical interactive first responder training 
in an engaging and accessible environment. 
We additionally host a free online training 
program through our CSX Learning Portal to 
educate emergency personnel on how to safely 
respond to incidents on and around railroad 
property and equipment. Hazmat's Click4Course 
offers participants the opportunity to gain an 
understanding of how railroads operate, including 
some of the hazards of working around the rails 
and necessary protocols to keep responders safe.
In 2021, CSX unveiled a new virtual learning course 
that enables employees to receive certification 
in automated external defibrillator (AED) and 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from 
the convenience of their home or workstation. 
This course teaches lifesaving skills including 
emergency recognition when responding to or 
managing a range of incident-related injuries. Six 
months after completing the course and related 
assessment, employees are offered a refresher 
video. After one year, employees must re-certify.
272021 Environmental, 
Social and Governance ReportFrontline Leadership Program
In late 2021, we implemented a frontline leadership 
program to create ownership in the field and 
conduct safety walkabouts in collaboration with 
our union districts. Through this program, CSX’s 
frontline leadership walk alongside local chairmen 
within their specific terminals to identify potential 
risks while simultaneously spreading the message 
about why safety is important. This enables 
union teams and union leaders to spread safety 
awareness along with field employees. 
Safety Summits Program
CSX’s Safety Summits Program allows for the 
integration of senior leadership at the field level. 
The program brings in a group of up to  
20 employees who are executing the daily  
on-the-ground work to have an open dialogue 
with leadership about safety expectations and 
obstacles at their respective locations. Through 
open, collaborative dialogue, CSX can determine 
necessary changes to procedures and protocols. 
There were 1,300 CSX field employees who 
attended one or more safety summits in 2021.SafetyCSX Partners with Operation Lifesaver to

CSX Honors 71 Customers with Annual Chemical 
Safety Excellence Award Our longstanding partnership with Operation 
Lifesaver, a nationally recognized leader of  
rail safety education, allows CSX to connect with 
communities to promote safe behavior near railroad 
tracks and trains. 
In 2021, CSX joined Operation Lifesaver, Operation 
Lifesaver Canada and the Mexican Association 
of Railroads (AMF) to help stop tragedies around 
railroad tracks and trains by observing Rail Safety 
Week — an annual weeklong effort emphasizing 
the need for rail safety education and to empower 
millions of people in North America to make safe 
decisions around tracks and trains.
In 2021, CSX held our 27th annual Chemical Safety 
Excellence Awards in recognition of our customers’ 
commitment to safe hazardous material rail car 
loading and maintenance. We were proud to honor 
71 of our shippers who finished 2020 without a 
single release due to controllable factors, including 
splashes and leaks on the CSX network.
The awards are presented to qualified customers 
who ship more than 600 carloads of hazardous 
materials without experiencing a non-accident 
release during the entire year. The recipients, who 
shipped a combined 238,000 carloads, represented 
a wide range of industry segments and products, 
including chemicals, biofuels, waste and fertilizers.Further, CSX Police started an Incident Reduction 
team in conjunction with Operation Lifesaver in 
2021, made up of three special agents focused 
on training and collecting data from crossing and 
trespasser incidents. The team uses this information 
to train first responders and local police to further 
investigate and conduct blitzes in relevant areas.

Sustaining Our Safety 
Performance 
CSX is dedicated to safety, including our drive for 
no life-changing events and constantly looking 
out for each other and our peers. We know there 
is no competition when it comes to safety — our 
company, peers and customers should always be 
looking for ways to improve, to establish trust and 
to promote safety amongst all stakeholders. 
We pride ourselves on the impact we’ve made 
across our business and in our surrounding 
communities, but we recognize we can always 
improve upon our efforts to scale success and 
safety for all. We will continue to invest time and 
resources into policies, processes, education and 
training programs to further improve our safety 
measures and outcomes. Transforming & Improving Our Safety Policies
Our shareholders, customers, employees and 
communities expect CSX to maintain a safe and 
secure network. Through open communication, we 
know we can better understand the root causes 
of human factor errors and safety incidents. It is 
imperative that we work alongside our labor union 
partners to address safety rules and practices. 
One way we have been able to do this is by changing 
our approach to operational testing for trainmen 
and conductors to promote greater employee 
understanding and compliance with safety practices 
and operating rules. In 2021, we worked alongside 
the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air 
Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART-TD) — the 
union representing CSX trainmen and conductors — 
to revise our company Discipline Policy.Under the new rule, CSX leaders utilize non-punitive 
methods to address operational testing failures, 
including having union representatives proactively 
intervene to help employees focus on best safety 
practices. Trainmen and conductors observed 
taking unsafe actions are subject to informal 
coaching, dialogue, education and opportunities for 
remedial training, an approach designed to foster an 
environment of learning and respect. CSX strives to 
similarly incorporate this educational approach into 
all facets of our business, spanning safety, customer 
experience and community engagement.

Nevertheless, service interruptions proved 
inescapable. We responded to and solved 137,410 
carload and intermodal customer cases in 2021, 
which represented a 30 percent uptick from the 
previous year. Recognizing that we had to quickly 
evolve to deliver the best-in-class service and 
interaction that our customers have grown to  
expect from CSX, we expanded our workforce 
significantly and increased our customer solutions 
team by 40 percent. By continuing to invest in network capacity, 
customer service technology and new service 
offerings, CSX added to a solid operating 
foundation that will support future business 
growth and ESG progress. Additional 2021

Our customers are leveraging rail service now, 
more than ever, considering the opportunity 
to reduce their environmental footprint while 
optimizing their supply chains. In 2021, CSX 
began developing a series of environmental 
excellence awards in recognition of our customers’ 
commitments to reducing their carbon footprints, 
with the identification of nearly 12 customers who 
are going above and beyond in their dedication to 
improved processes. We officially launched the 
awards in 2022, further integrating our customers 
into our ESG journey.
CSX Introduces Integrated 
Intermodal Chemical 
Transportation
In 2021, CSX announced that it had signed a 
definitive agreement to acquire Quality Carriers, Inc., 
the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals truck 
transportation in North America. As a leader in bulk 
chemicals transportation since 1913, Quality Carriers 
operates more than 2,500 trucks and 6,400 trailers 
that serve many of the largest chemical producers 
and processors. 
The addition of Quality Carriers enables CSX to 
extend the reach of its network and gain access 
to new products, markets and regions through a 
unique and competitive multimodal solution that 
leverages the reach of truck transportation with 
the cost-advantage and carbon benefits of rail-

Customer Experience & Results  
Providing excellent customer service means 
investing in the tools and technologies that provide added value and efficiencies. In 2021, we doubled down on digital business transformation with the understanding that measures we take to improve the safety and efficiency of the railroad ultimately translate to an improved customer experience. We demonstrated this by leading U.S. railroads in 2021 for lowest average terminal dwell.

 Intermodal T erminal Reservation System  
Our Intermodal Terminal Reservation System 
further allowed us to ensure maximum flexibility and fluidity at terminals, with 99 percent of customers leveraging the technology solution to make gate reservations. CSX intermodal terminals were the only terminals across the Class I intermodal system that did not shut down due to bottlenecks in the supply chain in 2021. One aspect of this included our investment in opening nearly 12 container yards across strategic locations to help to alleviate congestion and sustain fluidity at intermodal facilities.  
The other component was leveraging the gate reservation system to meter traffic into facilities where we were experiencing elevated levels of congestion. Lastly, we added an Intermodal Reservation Standby service, which operates similarly to flying standby, allowing for increased reservation efficiencies and optimization.  
 TRANSFLO  
TRANSFLO, a tool utilized across our network, helps customers take advantage of the economic and environmental benefits of rail without having rail infrastructure at their facility. At each of the 47 TRANSFLO transloading terminals, bulk products are safely transferred between railcars and trucks, giving customers flexibility to access new markets and suppliers. TRANSFLO has experience with more than 300 different products, including chemicals, crude oil, dry bulk, ethanol, food-grade products, plastics and waste materials.  
Because of its critical value, CSX continues to invest in opportunities to expand our TRANSFLO business. Whereas historically we’ve focused on the chemicals market for our multimodal business, moving forward CSX is focusing on expanding wallet share and working to transload volumes in additional markets. In 2021, we expanded our multimodal focus to both the  
forest products group and the metals group  
while also adding Quality Carriers to  
TRANSFLO’s services.

Our pioneering XGate  system not only 
accelerates the pace of customer deliveries, but also reduces potential emissions at intermodal terminals by up to 90 percent. We currently have more than 53,000 drivers registered with XGate and have rolled out the ability to use the service at all CSX Intermodal facilities, allowing all CSX customers to benefit from optimized flow across terminals while saving time and resources and reducing air emissions.  
XGate was a critical tool in our response to supply chain disruption, including upstream and downstream bottleneck issues that arose at terminals across the United States in 2021. As thousands of ships were halted at domestic seaports, logjams inevitably developed. Labor constraints subsequently ensued because containers that traditionally moved within 24 hours were now sitting for weeks. With CSX customers already familiar with our technology and shippers already used to applying reservations through XGate, we were able to quickly adapt and finetune our processes while gathering critical feedback. CSX Expands Its 
Northeastern Network 
In 2021, CSX applied to the Surface Transportation 
Board (STB) for approval of its acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. and its short line subsidiaries. The regional railway group, headquartered in Massachusetts, owns and operates a highly integrated 1,200-mile rail network across New England and offers access to multiple ports and large-scale commodity producers. 
The acquisition is expected to allow for the 
development of new business opportunities and service solutions for shippers and receivers in the New England region. The transaction will additionally expand CSX’s reach in Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts while adding Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine to its existing 23-state network.

Shell Around Diverse  
Hiring Practices
In 2021, Shell solicited advice from CSX on how 
to implement diverse hiring best practices in 
a specific part of the country where they were 
developing a major plant in our network. This 
engagement demonstrates not only CSX’s 
commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion 
but also the established trust we’ve built with 
customers and partners who are engaging with 
CSX around guidance and support in advancing 
their own critical social efforts.   
Customer Experience
“SNF is constantly seeking innovative ways to create 
value, increase utilization of available resources and 
control costs while minimizing our carbon footprint.  
As such, our partnership with CSX through intermodal 
and multimodal shipping and delivery is an excellent 
example – we utilize CSX rail over the long-haul part of 
the journey and Quality Carrier assets on the short-haul 
pickup and delivery. T ogether, we are creating better 
utilization and quality of life for local truck drivers, 
controlling costs and reducing the overall carbon 
footprint of the delivery. This is an all-around win for 
SNF, our transportation partners like CSX, our  
customers and the environment.”

Customer Feedback & Engagement 
CSX is constantly evolving the ways in which we 
receive shipping instructions, plan switches and 
other business transactions from our customers 
to improve their experiences when doing business 
with us. We work closely with our customers to 
collaborate, build and sustain their trust, gather 
feedback and ultimately ensure we are bringing 
viable solutions to the table to address their needs.
  Customer Engagement Forum  
Biannually, we convene up to 15 large CSX 
customers to engage firsthand with our executive 
team and hear from senior leadership on the 
state-of-the-railroad in an intimate environment. 
Highway-to-rail conversion was a significant part of 
the dialogue in 2021, as well as value-added service 
expansion concerning carbon emissions reduction.  
 
Due to pandemic restrictions, these forums were 
conducted virtually over the past couple of years. 
While we know there is great value in face-to-
face engagement, the virtual format provided the 
benefit of expanded attendance. In the spring of 
2021, we had nearly 80 customers join virtually 
to hear from our CEO on CSX’s plans for the 
immediate future.  
 
By the fall of 2021, we were able to pivot back to 
an in-person meeting, inviting a more intimate 
group of customers to gather and learn about the 
opportunities and challenges our executive team  
is focusing on for 2022. Through this forum, we were able to gain additional insight into 
upcoming customer challenges, which will allow 
us to cater our services to best fit their changing 
needs and for our customers to directly influence 
our strategy.  
 
Moving forward, we will continue looking for 
opportunities to engage our customers through 
small group interactions and through farther-
reaching virtual formats. 
  Operational Training Camps  
In 2021, we launched operational camps in which 
a cross-functional group of executives instill in 
mid-level managers a better understanding of the 
company strategy and skills that empower them 
to make decisions and drive positive change in 
our organization. These camps equip managers 
to better leverage innovation, technology and our 
high-performance workforce to provide best-
in-class service and unprecedented reliability to 
customers. We operate one Operations Training 
Camp each month, with sessions currently 
scheduled through the end of 2022.
  Voice of the Customer Survey  
Last year, CSX transitioned from using a third-
party vendor and brought our voice of the 
customer (VOC) survey in-house. This enabled us 
to streamline the process, reduce the number of 
questions we ask our customers and focus more 
squarely on soliciting their insights. The response 
rate for these quarterly surveys increased from 5 
percent to 16 percent in the past year, with many 
feedback topics surrounding crew availability 
throughout the pandemic. Improving In-House Services  
CSX’s Sales and Marketing department, made up 
of multiple sales sub-teams, consistently partners 
with operations to ensure an excellent  
and interconnected customer experience.
Investing in cloud-based technology has allowed 
our integrated teams to create efficiencies,  
reduce time on manual tasks and implement  
new ways to interact and collaborate at the 
customer account level, all of which strengthen  
the customer experience. After transitioning  
CSX’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
capabilities to Salesforce in 2020, we were able  
to further centralize our in-house capabilities in 
2021 by having our sales and marketing teams  
plus our operations team manage processes  
using Service Cloud.2021 Environmental,

Social and Governance ReportRails and roads don’t move freight, people do. At CSX, 
more than 20,900 employees provide the foundation for 
our success, with each one contributing uniquely valuable 
perspectives and skill sets. Their contributions are what keep 
our company, our customers and our communities moving 
forward toward our shared goals. 
To continue delivering on our company-wide 
vision and aspirations we need the best people 
and to attract the best people we need a strategy 
that values each individual’s contributions while 
instilling a sense of pride, equality and belonging. 
In January 2021, we formally launched the next 
phase of our organizational strategy to redefine 
who CSX is as a company and unite and excite 
our employees. We developed new values to work 
safely; grow through service; lead with passion 
and integrity; strengthen our communities; and 
create our future as One-CSX. These values are 
core to our strategy and commitment to fostering 
a One-CSX culture. One-CSX describes the culture 
we aspire to create, where we operate as one team 
with all employees feeling empowered and able to 
contribute to our broader business objectives.Our culture strategy is guided by four tenets:  
•  Ensure Mission Clarity:  
Embed values and new ways of working  
•  Sustain T op Talent:   
Attract and retain the best talent by creating a 
connected culture
•  Unlock Potential:   
Develop strong individuals into even stronger 
teams
•  Cultivate High Performance:   
Create a framework where employees thriveWorkforce
To achieve our business goals, CSX’s culture 
of safety, accountability and excellence must 
evolve to include more innovative and diverse 
perspectives, a passion for service and an 
environment where our employees think and 
work as One-CSX and are able to achieve their full 
potential. 
In 2021, we built on existing program successes 
by expanding our employee-led business resource 
groups (BRGs) and Social Justice Action Plan. 
We introduced new elective benefits that offer 
comprehensive, holistic financial well-being.
Moving forward, we will continue evolving our  
One-CSX culture with an emphasis on building a 
more diverse, engaged and motivated workforce.“We are at our best when 
we work together as 
one – CSX employees 
focused on a common 
goal, partnering across 
geographies, departments 
and crafts to achieve 
collective success. That's 
One-CSX. It is a renewed 
commitment to break 
down silos and operate 
with shared values as we 
tackle projects head-on. 
It's the cultivation of a 
culture where people feel 
empowered and included.”

Addressing Social Justice &  
Racial Equity   
CSX is committed to social justice and racial 
equality – within our organization and throughout 
our communities. We are adding CSX’s voice to the 
side of anti-racism to not only meet our societal 
obligation but also to help strengthen our culture  
of inclusion. 
As we resolve to address social justice with 
purpose, we have created our own Social Justice 
Advisory Roundtable, a cross-functional group of 
CSX employees and leaders to advance our efforts. 
This group reflects a diverse range of perspectives 
and expertise that has already increased dialogue 
around diversity, equity and inclusion at CSX and 
produced meaningful change for our employees 
and in our communities. The roundtable works 
closely with our leadership team to drive this 
important work forward.  
CSX advanced its social justice initiatives in 
2021 through support of the Congressional 
Black Caucus Foundation; sponsorship of the 
Jacksonville, Fla., Black Expo and Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day Breakfast; and a new partnership with 
the National Association of Black Accountants. In addition, we helped launch the 100,000 Steps 
Toward Social Justice initiative as part of our 
ongoing partnership with City Year, a nationwide 
organization that promotes educational equity. 
This initiative is designed to support systemically 
under-resourced schools with the tools they need 
to help our children succeed. Throughout the year, 
CSX employees from 12 states also supported 
City Year AmeriCorps members in Jacksonville, 
Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.
Fostering Candid Conversations
In June 2021, our Social Justice Advisory 
Roundtable held a virtual discussion to provide 
employees with an opportunity to learn more 
about our company’s social justice actions and 
contribute to the conversation about diversity and 
inclusion in the workplace.
During the discussion — the highest-attended 
employee event of 2021 — a panel of senior 
leaders and members of the Social Justice 
Advisory Roundtable shared an overview of CSX’s 
progress on social justice issues, plans for the 
coming months, areas for additional focus and 
opportunities for employees to engage as change 
agents in the organization.CSX’s Social Justice Action Plan  
 
Awareness, Education and 
Communication:  
Sharing of diversity metrics and culture 
survey results; roundtable discussions; 
listening sessions and open dialogue; 
increased company match of employee 
contributions to organizations supporting 
racial equity; and distribution of 
enlightening videos and articles.
Potential or Perceived Inequities: 
Modernizing job titles to remove 
terminology that may be offensive or 
have racial connotations; reiterating zero 
tolerance policies; establishing long-term 
targets and performance management; 
ensuring bias mitigation and pay equity; 
and acknowledging the role of Black 
employees in CSX history.
Employee Development:  
Enhancing professional development 
for mid-level managers; increasing 
mentoring opportunities and leadership 
coaching for people of color; developing 
executive sponsors and leaders of BRGs; 
and sponsoring industry-related diversity 
resource groups.
Voter Education:   
Increasing voting and awareness 
internally; communicating voting days 
and procedures across our territory; and 
encouraging voting on election days.“Social justice is essential 
for expanding economic 
prosperity to all people, 
in all communities. We 
are a stronger country — 
and a stronger company 
— when we can bring our 
full selves, our unique 
perspectives and our 
individual abilities to 
the work we do while 
knowing each of us are 
valued and respected.”

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
At CSX, we believe that diversity of thought, skills 
and experience ultimately contributes to better decision making, innovation, higher employee engagement and ability to attract talent. In 2021 we continued efforts to build a workforce that reflects the communities we live in and serve, starting with our hiring practices. This included providing interviewers and hiring managers with best practices and enhanced training, so they  
were better equipped to identify talent while mitigating unconscious bias.
While we are moving in the right direction, we 
recognize there is more work to be done. As a  
next step on our broader journey, we are releasing our 2021 EEO-1 data to provide insight into  
the makeup of our workforce. This data can be found in the Appendix of this report. We plan 
on sharing this data annually moving forward to increase transparency around how we are advancing diversity and representation across  
the organization. 
More information on our approach to an 
inclusive workplace can be found in our

Most notably, CSX achieved a 90 percent score on 
the 2021 Disability Equality Index (DEI) and was recognized as a ‘Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion’ by Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities for the third consecutive year.
Additionally, CSX President and CEO Jim Foote

Business Resource Groups (BRG)   
CSX is proud of the many BRGs that have been 
initiated by our employees to connect with 
their colleagues who have shared interests and 
experiences. Each BRG is led by an executive-level 
sponsor, with the goal of promoting a diverse, 
inclusive and engaged workplace culture.
2021 was another strong year for BRG 
engagement, with seven BRGs comprised of 
employees from various departments and career 
levels hosting 22 events. CSX’s 2021 BRGs — and a 
few of the initiatives they led — include:
  ABLE Disability Inclusion Group (ABLE):  
Focuses on fostering a sense of belonging  
for those living with disabilities by hosting 
advocacy events and engaging business  
partners to design, develop, and build  
accessible and inclusive services and  
offerings for employees and customers.  
 
In 2021, ABLE hosted a workshop and facilitated 
a discussion for National Disability Employment 
Awareness Month about disability etiquette and 
what it means to be inclusive of the disability 
community. CSX employees participated in the 
panel and shared their personal and professional 
experiences advocating for disability inclusion, 
including their experiences as parents of children 
with disabilities.      African American Inclusion Group:  
Focuses on creating a culture that embraces 
inclusion and promotes African American 
representation at CSX, and for our industry, 
through three core pillars – community 
outreach, professional development  
and networking.  
 
Employees hosted a forum with Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities to expand 
awareness of their role in history and build on 
the company's opportunities for partnership, 
as well as held in informational discussion 
on the disparities facing the Black LBGTQ+ 
community. They also engaged peers across 
the country in a discussion on social justice  
that gave all participants an opportunity to 
share their experiences during the nation's 
social unrest and to exchange ideas on how 
team members could continue to support  
one another.
      Asian Professionals for Excellence (APEX): 
Seeks to promote stronger working 
relationships between Asian and non-Asian 
employees through cultural education and 
networking events, with representation from 
more than 15 ethnic groups.  
 
Employees hosted several events to help raise 
cultural awareness and support racial equity, 
including hosting a virtual panel discussion 
about ways to create more understanding 
in America's communities and stop violence 
against Asian Americans, as well as an engaging

      LGBTQ+A(llies):   
Focuses on advocacy, education, policy and 
community outreach in support of the LGBTQ+ 
community and engaging family and friends 
who serve as allies. In recognition of LGBTQ+ 
History Month in October 2021, LGBTQ+A(llies) 
held a virtual panel discussion to discuss four 
strategies for pronoun usage in the workplace. 
The discussion explored society’s deeper 
understanding of gender identity and evolving 
use of gender pronouns and how they help 
foster a sense of belonging for all.
      Military Business Resource Group:  
Supports CSX’s veterans or active-duty military 
employees, Pride in Service activities and 
employee families when their loved ones are 
deployed in active military service. The group 
was relaunched to CSX employees in  
October 2021. 
       STEAM:  
Focuses on sparking interest in technology and 
innovation amongst all employees in the areas 
of science, technology, engineering, art and 
math (STEAM). STEAM hosted an Innovation 
Week in June 2021 to inspire and empower 
innovation in all employees. The group solicited 
employee suggestions on how CSX could 
continue to adapt and deliver innovative 
solutions at the forefront of the industry and 
prepared a week’s worth of lunch-and-learn 
modules and opportunities to meet the teams 
driving CSX’s digital transformation. 2021 Business Resource

Hiring for Growth   
We are dedicated to attracting top talent from 
different industries and backgrounds as we 
know that bringing in critical expertise, diverse 
experiences and varied skillsets best position CSX 
for sustained growth. 
When faced with supply chain disruption and 
a tight labor market in 2021, CSX responded 
aggressively to fill our hiring pipeline for frontline 
railroaders. We dramatically expanded the size of 
the pipeline and implemented new measures in 
recruiting, staffing and engaging our workforce. 
We re-evaluated requirements for the role, 
implemented a referral program for current 
employees, expanded our presence across 
several types of media, provided a 40 percent 
pay increase for conductor trainees, implemented 
video interviewing and gave the opportunity for 
candidates to engage in a virtual conversation  
with leaders.  Talent Development & Education    
Our growth strategy requires enhanced capabilities 
and perspectives. We leverage the contributions 
of individual skill sets and teams to become an 
even stronger organization. We invest in our people 
through learning and development and encourage 
employees to take advantage of internal programs and 
external partnerships to advance career potential and 
performance.
In 2021, we increased virtual and in-person training 
classes and introduced new courses through the 
learning portal. Many of our classes are comprised 
of cross-functional groups to create a more diverse 
learning environment. 
By providing employees opportunities to grow their 
skills and competencies outside of their day-to-day 
roles, we aim to provide our people the support, tools 
and opportunities they need to not only lead in their job 
function, but also shape the future of the industry.

Performance Management   
Our robust performance management process 
helps us measure and foster a high-performing 
workforce focused on delivering CSX’s business 
and strategic goals. Effective goal planning and 
goal setting are important steps in directing 
individual, departmental and, ultimately,  
company performance. 
Each employee has the primary responsibility 
for owning their professional development and 
progressing their desired career path. Along the 
way, CSX People Leaders play an important role 
by providing support, advice and feedback, all 
of which can positively impact overall employee 
career satisfaction.
Through our performance review process, 
employees complete a self-assessment of their 
progress and results against their personal and 
company goals. Managers gather feedback across 
the employee’s teams, departments and business 
partners, then compile and share back the insights. 
While the formal review process happens annually, 
we encourage employees to seek and share 
feedback with colleagues on an ongoing basis.In the survey, we assessed topics including:
       •  Trust and business ethics
       •  Communications and talent management
       •  Satisfaction with culture and  
employee engagement
Prioritizing Health & Holistic Well-being
We understand that there is no “one size fits all” 
approach to health and well-being. As such, we 
are committed to helping our employees through 
tailored tools, resources and support programs 
designed to meet their individual needs. 
We offer benefits related to physical, emotional, 
social and financial support to ensure all CSX 
employees, at all stages and levels in their careers, 
are able to receive assistance across the health 
and well-being spectrum. This included expanding 
our library of mental health resources with the 
introduction of a new Mental Health Toolkit and 
Training Series for employees in 2021. Employee Engagement & Recognition   
As our employees are core to our success, it is 
important that they are engaged in their work 
and our corporate purpose. We have a number 
of assessments, surveys and studies that help 
us gather employee feedback to expand our 
understanding of employee perceptions,  
including the 2021 employee focus groups 
conducted to help inform and redefine our  
One-CSX values and behaviors. 
There were a number of actions implemented 
to engage, recognize and reward employees, 
including advancing our pay for performance 
philosophy, implementing of our well-being 
strategy, and enhancing the Accelerate  
recognition platform. Designed to recognize 
employees across the company with notes of 
appreciation, Accelerate is an internal social 
acknowledgement platform where leaders 
and peers can recognize the hard work and 
contributions of their teammates and give  
visibility to their achievements.
To better understand our employees’ diverse 
viewpoints and how we can best support them, 
we planned and developed a formal employee 
engagement survey in 2021 that was rolled out at 
the beginning of 2022. Results of the survey will be 
leveraged to help continually shape the CSX culture 
as we make adjustments to how we approach 
issues and capture opportunities going forward.“As a People Leader, 
there is no greater reward 
than when I see a direct 
report empowered in 
and enthusiastic about 
their career. Every 
employee comes to CSX 
bringing unique value 
to the collective team. 
Wherever they are on their 
career journey, it's my 
job to support them and 
provide the resources and 
opportunities they need 
to bring their full selves to 
work every day."

Compensation & T otal Rewards   
CSX offers highly competitive total rewards 
packages for our management and union 
employees designed to support employee 
recruitment, retention, engagement, and  
diversity and inclusion, as well as our growth 
objectives as a company.
 
We expanded the elective benefits offered to our 
employees in 2021, including: 
  Back-up Care – Ensuring CSX employees can 
contribute their best while on the job means 
helping prepare for the unexpected. This 
subsidized program for all CSX employees 
includes access to a database of caregivers for 
a wide range of needs — from childcare, to pet 
care, to support with elderly or special needs 
adults, to housekeeping.
  Financial Planning – Together with Empower 
Retirement, we announced a partnership that 
provides all employees with financial planning 
assistance. From student loan payments 
to retirement saving, advisors help create 
comprehensive financial plans that tailor  
short-term and long-term goals to the 
employee’s needs.    Student Loan Repayment Program – 
Announced in 2021 and available starting in 
2022, the program provides eligible management 
employees with $200 a month, up to $2,400 a 
year, toward paying off student loans acquired in 
earning a higher education degree.
A full summary of our elective benefits can be 
found on our Benefits Summary page.
We regularly benchmark our compensation and 
benefits against railroad peers and general industry 
standards to ensure CSX’s Total Rewards package 
remains competitive based on the ever-changing 
market. Additionally, every three years since 2013, 
CSX has conducted a pay equity study to evaluate 
compensation practices of CSX management 
employees (pay for union employees is negotiated 
under a separate process). The most recent study 
was conducted in 2021 and was reviewed by an 
independent auditor. This process helps ensure we 
are paying employees equitably and competitively 
in order to retain the best railroaders.“Our commitment to helping employees spans every 
aspect of personal well-being — financial, physical, 
emotional and social. We are committed to tailoring  
our offerings and adding new elective benefits to our 
total rewards package in response to ongoing feedback 
from our employees around the challenges that most 
concern them.”

Social and Governance ReportSupply Chain
We responded to supply chain challenges across the 
transportation industry with innovative solutions and 
operating plan adjustments that helped to alleviate 
congestion and maintain freight deliveries throughout  
our network. 
Workforces across the globe faced significant 
challenges in 2021, including labor and supply chain 
disruption that required quick adaptation. Massive 
port lags and labor shortages resulting from the 
pandemic impacted CSX’s daily operations, but our 
proven procedures prepared us to overcome these 
obstacles. Despite these challenges, CSX moved 
nearly 6.3 million units of freight and accomplished 
18% revenue growth in 2021.
Driving Efficiencies Across our Network 
2021 underscored the importance of an efficient and 
reliable rail service for keeping supply chains fluid 
despite economic uncertainty. 
Building on existing continuity plans for business 
disruptions, CSX was able to quickly adjust 
operations in reaction to a sharp downturn in volume. 
These efforts were tailored to simultaneously 
address safety, wellness and execution strategies. 
In the face of widespread disruption, our operating 
model has proven to be adaptive and nimble, with 
innovative technology including ShipCSX and our 
Intermodal Reservation System helping us respond to and address customer needs at CSX terminals 
across the United States.
In 2021, in an effort to sustain operational 
efficiencies and continue to deliver our best-in-
class rail services, we prioritized ensuring the 
appropriate supplies were dispersed across our 
network while curbing against inflation as much  
as possible. 
Because of CSX’s lean procurement department, 
we were able to optimize the competitive 
advantage we hold over our Class I railroad peers. 
We stood firm in engaging the most efficient 
suppliers to effectively drive value and transport 
critical supplies across our network.
This lean organizational structure further 
allows our procurement department to develop 
relationships across multiple teams, leading to  
a configuration without silos and allowing for  
the growth of cross-functional business  
partners and suppliers. We have been working diligently to implement 
proficient processes for gathering supplier data. 
This was a major focus area for our teams in 2021 
and continues to be top of mind in 2022 as we 
prioritize the integration of ESG into all aspects of 
decision-making across our value chain. 
Responsible Sourcing & Supply  
Chain Standards 
We view our suppliers as an extension of our 
company — equally dedicated to environmental 
stewardship, high ethical standards and diversity. 
We work with approximately 4,800 suppliers 
domestically and internationally, all of which are 
expected to adhere to the CSX Code of Ethics. 
In 2021, we recommitted to engaging in CDP’s 
Supply Chain membership program to find 
synergies with suppliers and advance ESG 
practices through ongoing conversations and 
knowledge sharing. We mandate that our suppliers 
report environmental data through CDP’s 
questionnaires including the proportion of their 
GHG emissions that they can attribute to business 
with CSX, company-wide sustainable practices 
and climate change focused questions that allow 
us to better understand our supply chain footprint. 
Additionally, through our Supplier Diversity 
Program, CSX has committed to procuring all 
materials, supplies and services as outlined in our 
Diverse Supplier Procurement Policy . We offer 
an inclusive procurement process that provides 
opportunities for all suppliers, regardless of any 
social or economic distinction, including age, race, 
creed, color, sex, ancestry or national origin. While 
we do not award suppliers based on preferences 
that would result in unfair competitive advantages 
over others, we are committed to actively seeking 
and engaging diverse suppliers to compete for 
opportunities to support CSX.The Carolina Connector 
T erminal – The Future of 
Intermodal Rail
CSX has expanded its services to North Carolina 
with the completed construction of the Carolina 
Connector (CCX) terminal. After a temporary 
pause in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
intermodal terminal opened in September 2021, 
providing regional industries with convenient and 
reliable rail access while connecting consumers to 
products nationwide. 
CCX is positioned to reach more than five million 
consumers within a 120-mile radius and is 
strategically located close to the growing Raleigh 
metro near the major consumption market in the 
Triangle Region. With its leading technology, CCX 
features three wide-span, zero-emission electric 
cranes and further demonstrates the company’s 
leadership position in delivering more sustainable, 
truck-competitive transit. 
CCX will continue to prove invaluable amid supply 
chain logjams and disruption with its ability to  
relieve congestion and allow for more efficient 
container offloading.

Social and Governance ReportPride in Service
Our commitment to service 
extends beyond employees and 
customers and into our local 
communities. Not only is service 
core to who we are, it is at the 
heart of every decision we make.
Serving Those Who Serve
Three years ago, we introduced CSX’s signature 
community investment initiative, Pride in Service. 
Through this company-wide commitment, we do our 
part to honor and serve our nation’s military, veterans 
and first responders, connecting them and their 
families to what they need most. 
It is a cause that we are deeply passionate about  
and connected to across our business, from the  
one in five CSX employees that have served in  
some capacity to our own CSX police force that 
keeps our tracks operating safely. Our locomotives 
roll through many communities and neighboring  
military bases with a high concentration of military 
families, making our opportunity for impact as  
broad as our operations.
Oftentimes, military, veterans, first responders and 
their families incur hardships and financial adversity, 
both while they serve and when they transition to 
civilian life. Thanks to the dedication, involvement 
and gratitude of CSX employees and our mission-
driven partners, Pride in Service efforts have helped 
improve the quality of life for these individuals and 
their surrounding communities.We continue to increase our commitment to and 
investment in Pride in Service year after year. In 
2021 alone, CSX and its employees contributed 
more than 6,000 volunteer hours across various 
causes and 140 Pride in Service events, in  
addition to $10.4 million to communities across  
our network.

that it shows how many people

I have been impacted. In the

enlist a Soldier, commission an 
Officer, but we retain families.

initiative about the challenges 
for military families of color have 
implications for business families

Since the inception of Pride in Service in 2018, 
CSX has connected more than 350,000 service 
members and their families with resources and 
support in conjunction with five signature partners, 
including some of the nation's leading veteran, 
military and first responder organizations.Pride in Service
Blue Star Families
First Responders Children’s Foundation  
Operation Gratitude
Operation Homefront
Wounded Warrior Project
We’re incredibly proud of the dedication and 
commitment of our partners, our employees and 
our local community members. By collaborating to 
serve those who serve, we have been able to make a 
positive impact across our entire service territory in 
three core focus areas: critical financial assistance, 
community connections and acts of gratitude.
Critical Financial Assistance 
There are countless challenges affecting service 
families’ financial well-being — from employment 
and caregiving to deployment and frequent 
relocations. CSX works closely with its Pride 
in Service partners, providing critical financial 
assistance to support families who are struggling to 
make ends meet. 
  Operation Homefront – CSX and Operation 
Homefront work together to provide thousands of 
financial support grants to address families’ basic 
needs and potentially expensive life-transitions. 
In 2021, CSX contributed to Operation Homefront 
reaching key milestones such as providing the 
450,000th backpack filled with school supplies, 
serving 540,000 military family members with 
holiday meals, and providing baby supplies to more 
than 19,000 military moms since the start of these 
programs.  
 
As a result of CSX’s unwavering commitment to 
supporting military families, Operation Homefront 
presented John Kitchens, Director of Corporate 
Citizenship at CSX, with the Cornerstone Award 
for his dedication to helping Operation Homefront 
transform how it serves military families and 
delivers on its mission.   First Responders Children’s Foundation – 
Together with First Responders Children’s 
Foundation, CSX provides the children of fallen 
first responders with scholarships to make their 
dreams of higher education a reality. In 2021, CSX 
awarded 140 new and returning scholars with 
CSX Pride in Service Scholarships to support 
their education and continue the cycle of service 
started by their parents.  
 
First Responders Children’s Foundation also 
enables CSX to provide direct support for the 
families of first responders who were injured or 
killed in the line of duty. Through this partnership, 
we were able to support 17 first responder 
families in 2021 with resources and funding in 
their time of need. 
Community Connections
Military and first responder families live quite 
different lifestyles compared to their civilian 
counterparts, which can lead members of this 
community to feel disconnected and without a 
support network. As most military families reside in 
civilian communities, CSX prioritizes working with  
our Pride in Service partners to create a  
sense of belonging for servicemembers  
around the country. 
  Blue Star Families – Military families move on 
average two to three times as often as civilian 
families, meaning that they are constantly 
adjusting to new surroundings, school systems 
and neighbors. In 2021, CSX supported Blue Star 
Families’ inaugural Welcome Week, an initiative 
that encourages communities nationwide to 
come together to support the 600,000 active 
duty and transitioning military families that  
move each year. CSX also supports six Blue  
Star Families Chapters in key areas with high 
military populations.
47Harnessing Pride in Service  
for Social Justice  
 
CSX is leveraging the Pride in Service program to 
promote social justice and racial equity. CSX Pride 
in Service partner, Blue Star Families, established a 
Racial Equity and Inclusion Committee to examine 
the challenges facing military families of color, and is 
tailoring their programming based on the findings.
CSX Board Member, Lt. General Thomas Bostick, 
USA, Retired is a proud member of this committee 
where he shares his experience from the Army, his 
role in corporate America, as well as his passion for 
serving the community.
CSX is proud of the work that Blue Star Families, 
Lt. General Thomas Bostick, USA, Retired and the 
entire Racial Equity & Inclusion Committee are doing 
to support military families of color and increasing 
feelings of connection and belonging through their 
service, their communities and their workplaces. 2021 Environmental, 
Social and Governance Report  Wounded Warrior Project – CSX continued 
showing its support and raising awareness for the 
issues veterans carry with them each day through 
Wounded Warrior Project’s Carry Forward 5K, a 
community fundraiser designed to bring civilians 
together with those who served. More than 70 
CSX employees gathered in Jacksonville for the 
2021 event, raising more than $15,000. 
Acts of Gratitude
CSX and our employees recognize the sacrifices 
our military, veteran and first responders make to 
serve our country and our communities. Through 
our Pride in Service partnerships, CSX employees 
can give tangible acts of gratitude to those who 
serve. Since 2018, CSX has collectively donated 
more than 3,000,000 items to families and 
individuals in need.
  Operation Gratitude – CSX partners with 
Operation Gratitude to host various volunteerism 
events for employees to show their support for 
our service members. In 2021, CSX employees 
wrote more than 1,000 letters to service 
members, made more than 3,200 paracord 
bracelets and assembled more than 10,000  
care packages. Pride in Service
“As a law enforcement 
professional with almost 
25 years of experience, I’ve 
seen suicide from multiple 
angles. As a veteran, as a 
first responder, as a friend, 
as a family member, as 
a human, I want all my 
officers to take this training 
so they can be aware of 
the signs that there is 
a problem and assist in 
getting the proper help and 
resources to those people 
that need it.”

CSX Special Agent  
Supporting Mental Health & Suicide Prevention Training
 
Since 2010, Wounded Warrior Project has conducted the Annual Warrior Survey, the largest and most 
comprehensive survey of post-9/11 veterans. In 2021, CSX joined them as the first ever corporate sponsor 
of this important research. The 2021 survey revealed that more than 70 percent of warriors have reported 
experiencing PTSD, anxiety and depression as a result of their service and 25 percent have had suicidal 
thoughts in the past 12 months.
 
We will use these findings to further tailor our Pride in Service programming to effectively address the 
greatest challenges facing our veteran employees and the community at large. As many CSX employees 
have either served themselves or have close connections to military, veterans and first responders, we take 
seriously our role in preparing them to recognize the signs of mental health struggles and providing those 
around them with the necessary resources to get the help they need. 
Beyond the annual survey, CSX collaborates with Wounded Warrior Project to train its own police force, 
CSX Special Agents, on suicide prevention awareness, tools and resources. Our police force often must act 
as first responders, frequently the first on the scene, in traumatic situations that can pose a risk for their 
mental well-being. Since implementing these programs, CSX and Wounded Warrior Project have trained 
more than 90 employees.
482021 Environmental, 
Social and Governance ReportProviding Disaster Relief
Through the Employee Disaster Relief fund, CSX 
distributed more than $96,000 in grants in 2021 to 
support 14 employees who had been impacted by 
medical issues, including COVID-19, and property 
damage due to natural disasters. 
Throughout the year, several tornadoes impacted 
communities across CSX’s service network, 
specifically in Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee. 
In response to these disasters, CSX partnered 
with the American Red Cross, donating a total 
of $350,000 to provide relief for individuals and 
families in need.
Our Pride in Service partners are also great allies 
in the face of disasters, providing opportunities 
for CSX employees to give back and support 
their local communities. When a tornado touched 
down in Kentucky, our local Special Agents asked 
how they could help. We connected them with Pride in Service
First Responders Children’s Foundation, and 
together they donated $25,000 and eight pallets 
of clothing, toiletries, masks, personal protective 
equipment (PPE), hand sanitizer and toys for first 
responders and their families. 
Supporting Employees’ Passion  
for Giving Back 
Relaunched in 2021, CSX’s MBRG is committed 
to honoring and supporting our nation’s veterans, 
active-duty military and their families. Through this 
group, CSX employees have created an internal 
community to support their colleagues and their 
loved ones while providing valuable insights for 
CSX to support the military community at large 
through community outreach. 
With nearly 100 members across various 
departments, CSX’s MBRG has supported various 
events in the Jacksonville area such as Back to 
School Brigades with Operation Homefront, Bridging  
Community Divides
Understanding and healing the wounds of social 
inequity will take time, but we all have a significant 
role to play in enacting positive change. Through 
Pride in Service, CSX has partnered with First 
Responders Children’s Foundation to help bridge 
the divide between first responders and the 
communities they serve. Through initiatives such 
as Toy Express and National Night Out, we work 
together to provide law enforcement officers with 
toys and school supplies, empowering them to 
meaningfully connect with local families through 
positive interactions.
CSX also furthered its commitment to advancing 
social equity with Blue Star Families by sponsoring 
the Blue Star Families’ Social Impact Research 
2021: The Diverse Experiences of Military & Veteran 
Families of Color. This study is a necessary first step 
to form an evolved and multi-faceted approach for 
governments, nonprofits and companies like CSX to 
collectively ensure that diverse military families feel 
welcome in the communities they serve and reside 
in. As our Pride in Service programming and Social 
Justice Action Plan continue to evolve, this research 
will be an invaluable tool to support community 
connections – across the entire military, veteran and 
first responder community. 
In addition to the City Year partnership, CSX further 
demonstrated its commitment to fostering diversity, 
equity and inclusion, both internally and externally, to 
enhance awareness, education and communications, 
employee development, voter education and reduce 
potential or perceived inequities. military appreciation games with the Jacksonville 
Jumbo Shrimp and building a home for a local

CSX also continued to support, contribute to 
and help raise funds for No Greater Sacrifice, a 
nonprofit organization dedicated to investing in 
the children of our nation's fallen and wounded 
Service members by delivering scholarships and 
resources to improve their quality of life through 
higher education. In 2021, employees volunteered 
over 6,700 hours serving those in need.
Beyond the work of our MBRG, CSX makes it easy 
for employees to volunteer and support causes 
that matter to them through community partner 
organizations. We encourage our employees to 
select the causes and organizations that mean 
the most to them, with a number of programs and 
policies in place to maximize their impact.
  Dollars for Doers – When a CSX employee 
volunteers at least 15 hours, the CSX Foundation 
donates $10 per hour volunteered, up to 
40 hours, to an eligible organization of the 
employee’s choice. 
  Employee Matching Gifts – We match dollar-for-
dollar any donation made by a CSX employee to a 
501(c)(3) organization of the employee’s choice, 
up to $1,000. In 2021, we expanded our employee 
matching program to allow for more support of 
social justice organizations. 
  Board Service – CSX executives are eligible to 
serve on nonprofit boards of their choice through 
the CSX Foundation Board Service program. 
The Board Service program contributes to the 
organizations with which CSX executives are 
affiliated and provides counsel and guidance for 
CSX executives looking to become involved with 
a nonprofit board.49Serving the Jacksonville Community   
CSX is committed to supporting the Jacksonville community through community service, 
donation drives and employee volunteerism. Through our partnerships with the Jumbo Shrimp 
Minor League Baseball team and the Jacksonville Jaguars, CSX has hosted military appreciation 
game nights so that military members, veterans and their families can enjoy some of America’s 
favorite pastimes. 
In addition to serving the local community through Pride in Service, CSX works closely with City 
Year to support local young adults through community service. In 2021, CSX contributed $10.4 
million to various organizations, including City Year, Operation Lifesaver, American Red Cross and

Our Sustainability Aspirations
CSX has been diligently working towards its 
ambitious GHG emission reduction goals, guided by 
our science-based target to reduce GHG emissions 
intensity by 37.3 percent by 2030 against a 2014 
emissions baseline. In 2021, we continued to 
prioritize and adapt our fuel usage and network 
approach to increase fuel efficiency, drive greater 
network fluidity and reduce crew starts. 
CSX is currently tracking to meet its 2030 emissions 
target. From 2014 through 2021, we have improved 
fuel efficiency by 15.34 percent – an emissions 
intensity reduction of 15.6 percent – which puts us 
42 percent of the way toward reaching our goal.

initiatives, improvements and investments 
across these categories include:
CSX continues to evaluate new locomotive 
fuel conservation technologies and initiatives 
to drive greater operational efficiencies as we 
work toward our 2030 environmental goals. 
Our environmental efforts include a holistic 
set of 2030 aspirations for our business, 
including what we believe is necessary to 
keep working toward the target of limiting 
global warming to well-below 2°C above 
pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris 
Climate Agreement. These 2030 goals will 
help us better manage our environmental 
footprint across our emissions, energy 
sources, waste management and water 
usage and supply chain.
Combined, these efforts helped CSX 
continue to lead all U.S. Class I railroads on

Environmental Performance
In 2021, CSX was recognized by multiple 
environmental, industry and business leadership 
organizations for its strong environmental 
performance. We were the only U.S. railroad included 
in the DJSI for the 11 th consecutive year and the top 
U.S.-based Class I railroad in CDP’s 2021 climate 
leadership ranking for the ninth year running. 
Additionally, CSX was recognized as a 2021 CDP 
supplier engagement leader in the top eight percent 
of companies engaging their supply chains to 
reduce value chain emissions. We recommitted to 
participating in the CDP Supply Chain program in 
2021, through which we encourage suppliers to "live 
like CSX" in how they conduct sustainable operations 
and emissions reduction initiatives. Under the 
program, CSX monitors and measures Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions so that we can better understand 
our footprint across our entire supply chain. Climate-Related  
Risk Management & Oversight
At CSX, we take a proactive approach to  
assessing and addressing environmental and 
climate-related risks and opportunities. This 
includes those associated with new technologies, 
availability of fuel sources, reputational risks and 
opportunities, anticipated regulatory changes and 
potential shifts in our customers’ businesses as a 
result of climate change. 
At the Board level, the Governance and 
Sustainability Committee is responsible for 
overseeing environmental matters, risk oversight 
and evaluation, including risks associated with 
energy and environmental policy. Our Board of 
Directors maintains responsibility and oversight of 
climate-related issues.
Our Environmental team oversees environmental 
requirements and compliance, including managing 
and reporting on our energy, waste, water and air 
emissions. To help ensure regulatory compliance, 
CSX’s PSH&E management system tracks our 
environmental performance. 
In addition to performing independent reviews to 
track environmental performance, we regularly 
review and update our management systems and 
utilize third-party reviews of our existing programs 
to verify their effectiveness.

Climate-Related Scenario Analysis
In 2020, we conducted a climate-related scenario 
analysis as part of the process for establishing our 
new GHG emissions intensity reduction target.  
We regularly provide our Board and committees  
with climate-related business risks for consideration, 
and Board committees receive input from the 
functional departments most competent in the  
risk under consideration. We consider climate-related 
risk and opportunity types based on the TCFD risk 
types and classifications. 
As part of this analysis, CSX applies an internal 
methodology to evaluate potential scenarios where 
climate change and other types of disruption may 
impact operations and safety. Our analysis considers:
 
  Short-term  (i.e., 0-3 years)

Compliance
The CSX Environmental Operations team is 
responsible for overseeing and engaging on  
all local and federal compliance matters.  
In 2021, this included:
       •  Maintaining 41 Clean Air Act permits and 171 
Clean Water Act permits across our networks 
       •  Conducting 96 compliance reviews of 
our facilities and an annnual review of all 
environmental management processes
       •  Completing risk profiles at each of our facilities, 
as needed
       •  Identifying best-in-class technologies and 
training opportunities
To further ensure compliance, CSX uses our 
Environment Management System (EMS), 
which promotes, measures, tracks and improves 
sustainability across our operations. It also provides 
a clear, actionable plan for actively managing and 
minimizing the environmental impact of our  
facilities and operations. 
Responsible Care Partner Program
 
Every three years, CSX reapplies for its Responsible Care Partner Program Certification,  
overseen by the American Chemical Council (ACC). As our customers include chemical and  
hazardous material businesses, we must take great care to transport in compliance with  
various regulatory requirements. 
We demonstrate our commitment to adhering to the same Responsible Care requirements as  
ACC members through this certification process, which examines technical specifications of our  
EMS and evaluates policies, leadership and goals related to risk management, environmental  
health, safety and security. 
In early 2022, we completed our latest review and received recertification.

Locomotives
Our current operating model prioritizes scheduled 
railroading, which enables us to better manage our 
fleet by optimizing asset utilization and leveraging 
schedule-based trains. This means less idle time for 
locomotives, fewer locomotives operating and longer 
trains, which translates to benefits for the customer 
in terms of on-time product delivery and for the 
environment in terms of reduced GHG emissions.
We regularly review our fleet to uncover 
opportunities to decrease the number of 
locomotives. Since first introducing scheduled 
railroading in 2017, we have successfully reduced 
the number of locomotives needed to transport 
the same amount of cargo or more each year. 
Maintaining a buffer of stored locomotives and 
equipment also allows CSX to quickly adjust our 
active fleet based on demand and other factors while 
avoiding delays due to supply limitations or excessive 
lead times.

22 other locations between Baltimore and 
Philadelphia. Completion of the clearance 
initiative, projected for 2025, will mark a major 
milestone for intermodal rail service in the 
Interstate 95 transportation corridor.
In addition to increasing containerized freight 
capacity, the project will improve supply 
chain efficiency for shippers, reduce highway 
congestion for communities and deliver 
environmental benefits from increased use of rail. 
It is one of the largest public-private construction 
partnerships in Maryland’s history. “The project comes at a 
time when our nation and 
customers are hungry  
for solutions to climate

Recycling, Reuse and Waste Disposal
CSX’s commitment to protecting the environment 
is reaffirmed by our goal of reducing the amount 
of waste generated by our operations. We believe 
every employee has a role to play when it comes to 
increasing their level of recycling, saving precious 
landfill space and reducing waste disposal costs. As 
such, we provide regular opportunities for employees 
to help us achieve our goals in their daily activities, 
with programming that supports recycling and reuse 
of materials wherever possible. 
Through our recycling program at our Jacksonville 
headquarters, additional blue recycling bins have 
been placed in designated areas. Employees and 
facility managers are given clear instructions on the 
processes for how and what to recycle, including 
batteries, paper cardboard, toners and printer 
cartridges, plastics and fluorescent lights. 
 
CSX currently recycles the following waste streams 
system-wide:
  Steel –  We collect and recycle steel in old 
locomotives, rail, railcars and other equipment.
  Batteries –  We reclaim approximately 500,000 
pounds of signal and other rechargeable batteries 
each year. We also recondition or recycle 
locomotive batteries.  Oil –  Throughout our system, we recycle used 
oil from locomotive crankcases and other 
equipment. In a typical year, more than two 
million gallons of oil are recycled.
  Cross Ties –  We pioneered an innovative 
method for reusing cross ties by chipping them 
for use as an alternative fuel or to be reused as 
landscape timbers.
  Electronic Equipment –  CSX Technology 
manages the recycling of computers, monitors, 
modems, CRTs, hand-held devices and servers. 
Before being disposed of, all computers and 
related equipment are tested. Equipment in 
good condition is reused. Obsolete equipment is 
broken down into parts and recycled.
In 2021, we continued to ensure that supplies  
are properly reused and recycled, reducing  
costs and eliminating stormwater impacts  
from stray materials. The majority of the waste  
we generate derives from locomotive and 
equipment maintenance activities required  
for ongoing operations.

02  Innovation:  Integrating new technologies 
that optimize train handling and introducing 
efficiencies that increase train length and reduce 
train stops and startsCSX is dedicated to finding and developing 
solutions that can power our industry for the  
long-haul without compromising the environment. 
However, many solutions as they exist today are 
still nascent technologies, and it will likely be  
years before they can be leveraged as industry-
wide solutions. 
At CSX, the next generation of fuels and propulsion 
technology is already in development. In 2021, we 
invested $34.8 million in fuel efficiency measures, 
including investments in technologies and 
locomotive use.
We are continuing to evaluate alternative fuels and 
power sources that reduce our operational and 
GHG emissions footprint with a focus on two main 
categories of impact:
  Fuel:  Locomotive fuel efficiency and alternative 
fuel sources 
At CSX, we are using our innate desire to innovate to 
determine how we sustainably fuel tomorrow.   
612021 Environmental, 
Social and Governance ReportThe Future of Fuel 
The future of fuel requires robust investment and 
collaboration to truly advance innovative solutions 
and realize operational efficiencies. We are currently 
evaluating multiple fuel sources and technologies 
that provide alternative power sources or diesel 
replacements. As with many hard-to-abate sectors, 
alternative fuels will require extensive testing and 
regulatory approvals before they are commercially 
available. In addition to partnering with regulators 
to test fuel solutions, we are actively engaging with 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and 
FRA to conduct fuel tests to further the potential for 
regulatory approval. We are also partnering with industry peers to 
accelerate the energy transition. In 2021, we 
participated in a peer decarbonization working 
group convened by the AAR. The working group, 
which was composed of rail and industry-
adjacent peers, held regular calls to discuss the 
regulatory landscape and emerging technologies.

Driving Fuel Efficiencies  
We are continuing to develop a Meet Pass Planner 
(MPP) that will increase fluidity of trains throughout 
the CSX Network by reducing train meet and 
pass delays while optimizing train routing and 
performance. MPP uses real time data to provide 
dispatchers with dynamic runtime calculations and 
forecasting models to expedite the decision making 
and conflict resolution processes. 
We are also in the process of testing hybrid 
locomotives, which are particularly well-suited to 
capitalize on the efficiencies provided by the rolling 
hills of the East Coast. When passing through a city, 
hybrid engines can turn off, potentially delivering 
targeted emissions reductions in these urban areas.
The use of biofuels is another avenue CSX is 
exploring to reduce our carbon emissions. While 
rail can be four times as efficient as trucks, we 
nonetheless rely on carbon fuels to transport  
our freight. 
One of the biggest challenges in this space is finding 
the supply of biofuels. With airlines looking to reduce 
their environmental impact, sustainable aviation 
fuels are taking up most of the supply. Once a regular 
supply is found, CSX has the capabilities to transport 
and blend these fuels to B5 for emissions standards 
on-site, which could prove disruptive to the entire 
supply chain. When that moment comes, CSX will 
work with our suppliers to take as much biofuel as 
they can supply. In 2022, we have projects planned to test 
the use of biofuels to run our B20 engines, as 
well as potentially using liquified natural gas 
(LNG) for locomotive fuel. Additionally, we are 
working on a concept that uses compressed 
natural gas (CNG) to supply a generator that in 
turn supplies power to locomotives.Fuel Sustainability & Innovation 
Repowering Engines to Run for the Long-Haul
 
The typical lifespan of a CSX locomotive is 30 to 50 years, meaning we operate assets that are truly 
built for the long haul. To this end, we look to maximize the lifetime value of our trains by assessing 
opportunities to rebuild or “repower” engines so they can run on new or emerging fuels that ultimately 
reduce emissions. 
In 2021, we partnered with Wabtec, a transportation solutions company, to begin rebuilding AC4400 
engines to run on biofuel. Based on preliminary engine tests, these enhancements will result in a  
5% fuel savings, 20% improvement in fuel efficiency and 50% reduction in lube oil for current  
Tier 1 locomotives. 
Since CSX has the unique ability to blend our own biofuels, we plan to begin testing biofuel (B20)  
on the rebuilt locomotives.

Engaging Customers  
Around Efficiencies
With rail being the most sustainable mode 
of land-based freight transportation, CSX 
has an opportunity to not only drive positive 
environmental outcomes for our customers, 
but also for our environment, helping divert 
incremental volumes off the highway without 
sacrificing reliability.
CSX expects to see continued fuel efficiency 
improvements, lower operating costs and 
continued growth in our intermodal business 
as shippers seek more carbon-friendly 
ways to haul freight. It is a priority at CSX 
to communicate with our customers about 
the efficiency benefits associated with 
intermodal transportation.Customer Allocated

Innovating for Efficiency  
CSX maximizes sustainability and efficiency through 
a number of automation technologies, initiatives and 
process changes. 
Examples of the technologies we are evaluating and 
implementing include:
  Distributed Power – CSX continues to invest 
in distributed power (DP) across our fleet. DP 
locomotives are more efficient as they distribute 
forces acting on the locomotive throughout the 
train, allowing for a larger train build and thus 
movement of more freight with less fuel.   
  Fuel Conservation Desk – The CSX 24/7 
Fuel Conservation Desk helps identify where 
opportunities remain to further drive fuel 
efficiencies. Operated out of our Jacksonville HQ 
Network Operations Center, the Fuel Conservation 
Desk monitors all active CSX line-haul locomotives 
and manages locomotive horsepower and 
efficiency. The team uses minute-by-minute 
monitoring to determine opportunities to conserve 
fuel by identifying locomotives that can be shut 
down, rather than remaining idle.   
  Idle Reduction T echnologies  – CSX has invested 
more than $50 million since 2000 in idle reducing 
technologies, which have been proven to reduce 
fuel consumption and Scope 1 emissions. 
Automated Engine Start Stop (AESS), for example, automatically shuts down the locomotive when 
not in use and automatically starts it again when 
needed. CSX employees are trained on proper 
locomotive shutdown rules and procedures to 
eliminate unnecessary idling.
  Trailing Unit Shutdown – We continued to 
implement a trailing unit shutdown process,  
an operational change which gives the ability  
to shut down the backup locomotives behind  
the lead locomotive when not needed. Trailing 
unit shutdown has the potential to yield 
significant fuel savings without any impact  
to velocity or reliability. 
  Trip Optimizer – In 2021, we completed the 
rollout of Trip Optimizer technology across 
our mainline fleet of 2,100 locomotives. This 
automated locomotive cruise control device 
helps drivers achieve optimal fuel burn and  
saved approximately 36 million gallons of fuel  
in 2021. Overall, this technology has resulted in  
an average savings of 1.4 gallons of fuel per  
auto mile.  
Additionally, CSX is in the final stages of preparing 
a product safety plan for the FRA in order to launch 
our Zero to Zero technology, which is expected 
to save an additional five million gallons of fuel 
per year. Throughout 2022, CSX will continue to 
expand the use of Trip Optimizer across our entire 
rail network.

Social and Governance ReportFuel Sustainability & Innovation 
Equipping Employees to  
Embrace New T echnologies
As we continue to adjust our operating practices 
in line with our guiding principles, we are also 
educating our employees on the functions and 
benefits of new fuel alternatives and technologies 
to move us towards an even more efficient and 
environmentally friendly operating model. 
In addition to training employees on how to use the 
technology, CSX’s Mechanical Operations group 
is using existing technologies to limit unnecessary 
train stops. Acoustic detectors and temperature 
trending logic continue to be used to proactively 
identify bearings in distress before they cause line 
of road events. Within Mechanical Operations, the 
Communications and Signals group is reviewing 
thermal imaging technology to identify abnormal 
breaking conditions which cause delays and less 
fuel-efficient locomotives. 
To further emphasize the role of our employees 
in helping reach our goals and incentivize CSX 
employees to reduce train idling and conserve 
resources, we introduced a fuel efficiency metric 
into our 2021 MICP. “Looking to new and emerging alternative fuel sources is 
essential in achieving a sustainable energy transition. That is 
why we are in the process of testing hybrid locomotives and 
biofuels at CSX, ensuring we provide the highest quality  
service for our customers, whilst also minimizing our 
environmental impact.”

Social and Governance ReportCompensation
As an organization focused on pay-for-
performance, CSX provides competitive total 
compensation opportunities in line with market 
practices. Executive performance is evaluated 
by the Compensation and Talent Management 
Committee to ensure incentive payouts are 
consistent with the objectives of the executive 
compensation program. These elements include:
  Salary – Recruiting and retaining talented and 
high-performing leaders  
  Short-T erm Incentives – Motivating and 
rewarding performance within a one-year period  
  Long-T erm Incentives – Encouraging and 
acknowledging executives who drive strategic 
initiatives that create shareholder value
One way that CSX rewards employee contributions 
to the company’s success is through the MICP. The 
MICP links employee compensation to company 
and individual performance by providing incentives 
to management employees who drive positive financial and operational results and create 
shareholder value. 
In January 2021, the Board approved performance 
measures for that year’s MICP, which included 
financial performance measures, safety 
improvement, operational and fuel efficiency, all 
proven drivers of business success. To enhance 
future focus on sustainable growth, weightings for 
each performance measure were also formalized, 
as noted below.Governance & Oversight

important issues. 2021 engagements consisted  
of the following:
  Routine meetings between senior leaders 
and subject matter experts with institutional 
shareholders, and periodically with proxy 
advisory firms, to discuss CSX’s business 
strategy, corporate governance practices, 
executive compensation and ESG matters that 
are in the best interest of our broad and diverse

robust annual ethics training – which focuses 
on applying the code in daily interactions – is 
required for all CSX management employees and 
highly recommended for union employees. 
Employees are encouraged to anonymously 
report any violations to the code or other ethical 
concerns to the 24/7 CSX Ethics Helpline, 
which is operated by an independent service. 
In 2021, 959 reports were made to the helpline. 
Upon further review, we found 66 fraud-related 
investigations of the code.We prioritize responsible business practices not 
only because it is the right thing to do, but also 
because it helps CSX manage and respond to 
potential risks and opportunities that can have an 
impact on our business and our ability to provide 
value to our stakeholders. 
Ethics & Compliance
All CSX employees and officers, CSX wholly-
owned subsidiaries, members of the Board of 
Directors and partners conducting business with 
or on behalf of CSX are expected to act with the 
highest standards of personal integrity, consistent 
with the ethical behaviors outlined in the CSX Code 
of Ethics. 
The code covers a wide slate of business matters 
including conflicts of interest; insider trading; 
confidential information misuse; compliance 
with laws and regulations; discrimination and 
harassment; whistle-blower protection; public 
and employee safety; and proper use of corporate 
assets. This extends to how we position and price 
our services. CSX is committed to ensuring fair and 
competitive pricing for our customers.

Social and Governance ReportRisk Management & Oversight  
As an integral player in the transportation of 
essential goods, CSX must be prepared to mitigate any potential risk or disruption to our business. To achieve this, we have robust measures in place to predict, monitor for, manage and respond to external risks and opportunities that could directly impact our business, including new federal regulations and the impacts of climate change or climate-related events. 
In response to the potential business risks of supply 
chain disruptions that impacted countless industries in 2021, we once again leveraged the resiliency of our operating model to implement solutions to help alleviate congestion and keep our trains running smoothly.
Another example of our risk management approach 
is CSX’s company-wide climate change strategy which includes comprehensive business plans to ensure continuity of operations and adaptability of our network in the event of climate-related extreme weather. 
For details on our climate-related scenario analysis, 
please see the Environment section of this reportand for business risk factors, our Annual Report.
The Audit Committee of our Board oversees our risk management strategy, cyber security program and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, which Our ERM Framework  
Our ERM framework, which was revised in 2021, focuses on core enterprise risks and mitigation activities, detailing oversight responsibilities across relevant risk categories. is designed to help ensure senior management, the Audit Committee and the full CSX Board have a clear understanding of how enterprise-level risks are prevented, monitored, measured, reported  
and managed. 
Within the ERM program, dedicated Risk Leaders 
are tasked with monitoring and managing our four designated risk categories and the “core” risks within them. “CSX’s structured 
oversight capabilities and internal controls are critical to our growth and our ability to advance rail toward a more sustainable future. We prioritize the effective management of ESG-related risks and opportunities to meet our strategic business objectives and to provide assurance to stakeholders that we are prepared to adapt to changing regulation and external circumstances.”

Security Management
Strong performance and reliability of our technology 
systems are critical to our ability to operate safely and effectively. Our security framework, adopted by CSX’s Engineering Architecture team in 2021, is broadly integrated across the organization to enable the protection of our customers’ personal information and the integrity of our own operations, our contractors and our suppliers. 
Our Information Security team is responsible for  
day-to-day management and strategy 
implementation, including equipping our systems with the latest cybersecurity tools; conducting daily vulnerability scans; regularly providing critical cybersecurity information to all application users; and facilitating the annual required cybersecurity awareness trainings.Responsible Business Practices

Social and Governance ReportMonitoring & Responding  
to Cyber Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities require complex resolutions. 
We identify track, prioritize and manage risks 
from inception to validated remediation. This 
performance is summarized in ‘Technology 
Scorecards’ which capture key performance 
indicators such as the time and speed the team 
takes to respond to an event or remediate risk. 
We test our security infrastructure on an ongoing 
basis to evaluate and build detection and 
prevention capabilities. We also employ third party 
external assessments to evaluate our security 
engineering efforts, including the performance 
review or “cyber security maturity assessment” 
conducted in 2021 to measure CSX’s performance 
against security goals. The assessment found all 
goals had been met. 
Established in 2020 and reaching maturity in 
2021, our Risk Register Program uses quantitative 
modeling to assess and calculate risk impacts  
on business performance. This includes 
assessment of the likelihood of an event  
occurring, potential outputs and the overall  
impact it has on the organization. 
In addition to the Risk Register Program, we 
perform contract reviews with the third parties 
we work with to assess compliance with our cyber 
security requirements and perform annual cyber Responsible Business PracticesPutting Risk Response Planning into Action
While CSX’s security protocols have detected 
attempts to gain unauthorized access to our 
information technology systems, none of such 
attempts have resulted in any material breach of or 
disruption to our systems.
In January 2021, CSX’s Cyber and Information 
Security teams executed its incident response plan 
(ISP) in response to distributed denial of service 
attacks. The team notified third-party incident 
response partner, Mandiant, and sought general 
remediation counsel from Ernst Young. While CSX’s 
security protocols detected the attempt to gain 
unauthorized access to its information technology 
systems, there was no material breach or disruption to CSX’s systems. CSX’s response planning enabled 
the team to take quick action to activate its response 
plan and initiate remediation. Ultimately, given the 
data that was exposed, CSX initiated credit card 
monitoring to prevent such an event from happening 
in the future. 
CSX performs routine security assessment of key 
third-party vendors to prevent, anticipate, detect 
and/or react to such incidents in a timely manner. 
While some of CSX’s vendors have experienced 
cyber-attacks in the past, none have had a material 
adverse impact on CSX’s business or operations.security assessments where it is determined to 
be business critical. Higher risk entities identified 
through this process are monitored from a threat 
intelligence perspective. 
In 2021, CSX experienced one information  
security breach and one other cyber security 
incident. There were zero substantiated  
complaints concerning breaches of customer 
privacy and losses of customer data. CSX 
understands that protection of customer data is  
a significant responsibility and requires our highest 
priority continuously.
“CSX relies on information technology across all aspects 
of our business, making performance and reliability of our 
technology systems critical. By diligently planning and 
remaining agile, CSX upholds our commitment to customer 
and employee data security with dependable operations that 
positions us on the leading edge of innovation.”

752021 Environmental, 
Social and Governance ReportEngaging Our Employees 
in Cyber Safety
Everyone has a responsibility and role to play 
when it comes to upholding cyber and information 
security practices. This has become even more 
important across all levels of CSX employees as  
we continue to embrace and utilize remote  
working technologies. 
To keep cyber and information security best 
practices top of mind, the CSX Technology team 
spearheads ongoing communications via email 
and through our employee intranet on how to 
identify suspicious activity, where to make reports 
and what proactive measures employees can take 
to safeguard their information and devices, such as 
regularly updating passwords. 
At the end of last year, the CSX Technology team 
created a voluntary Cyber Security Awareness 
training to share additional guidance with 
employees on how to stay electronically vigilant. 
Using a third-party vendor, we implemented a 
monthly employee phish testing program in 2021. 
In coordination with mandatory and voluntary 
cybersecurity awareness training, only four 
percent of CSX employees failed the phishing 
tests, compared to the transportation industry’s 14 
percent average failure rate.Human Trafficking
CSX actively participates in the U.S. Department 
of Transportation (DOT) initiative to fight 
human trafficking through increased education 
and public awareness. CSX signed the U.S. 
DOT “Transportation Leaders Against Human 
Trafficking Pledge” and committed the company’s 
support to help raise awareness and collaboration 
across the transportation and travel industries. 
Expanding on these efforts to fight human 
trafficking, we launched an employee awareness 
campaign focused on education in early 2021. 
Through outreach and informative trainings, the 
campaign sought to raise awareness of how to 
recognize and report suspicious situations. Responsible Business Practices
Employees are encouraged to report suspicious 
or unusual behavior to the CSX Information 24x7 
Technology Service Desk. Approximately 75 service 
requests were submitted per month in 2021, with 
reported incidents tracked and monitored by the 
Security Operations Center (SOC).
Human Rights Policy
In 2021, we formally adopted and published our 
commitment to upholding human rights across our 
operations, businesses, communities and supply 
chains as outlined in our Human Rights Policy.
CSX is committed to operating its business in 
a manner consistent with international human 
rights principles, including those contained in the 
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and Global Compact and the International 
Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work. Expanding Efforts to  
Fight Human Trafficking 
Without access to a new job, there’s an 85 percent 
chance a human trafficking survivor will be re-
trafficked. Rethreaded is one organization working 
to combat that statistic, helping grant economic 
freedom for survivors through the sale of unique 
products created by the survivors themselves. 
In March 2021, CSX’s Interchange Women’s 
Leadership Network welcomed Stephanie Patton, 
assistant manager of business development 
for Rethreaded, to share her personal story as 
a survivor of human trafficking and how joining 
Rethreaded changed her life. CSX is proud to call 
Rethreaded one of its valued community partners 
and encourages its employees to support and 
engage with Rethreaded in the fight against 
human trafficking.

emissions from the use of biofuels.    
  
05  Diverse spend is defined as the amount, in dollars, spent  
with suppliers that are small, minority-owned or women-  
owned businesses.     
 
06  Average active trains per day excludes passenger and foreign 
trains.
      
07  Frequency of internal railway integrity inspections is the number 
of inspections per week, weighted for the number of main track 
miles on which those inspections took place. Calculated as 
(weekly inspections × miles of track on which they took place) / 
(total main track miles).  
 
08  FRA Personal Injury Rate calculated as cases / 200,000 
employee hours. Safety statistics are estimated and continue to

10  Fatality in 2022 after 2021 injury; updated reporting post  
annual report.  
  
11  Rate of work-related injuries and illnesses. An injury or illness 
is considered a recordable incident if it results in any of the 
following: death, days away from work, restricted work or 
transfer to another job, medical treatment beyond first aid, 
or loss of consciousness. Additionally, a significant injury or 
illness diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care 
professional is considered a recordable incident, even if it does 
not result in death, days away from work, restricted  
work or job transfer, medical treatment beyond first aid,  
or loss of consciousness.  
  
12  Fatality Rate is the rate of work-related fatalities / total number of 
full-time employees.   13  Number of accidents and incidents (combined) is any impact 
between railroad on-track equipment and a highway user at 
crossings. It includes any collision, derailment, fire, or other 
events involving the operation of railroad on-track equipment 
that results in reportable damage above thresholds established 
in 49 CRR 225.5; other incidents or exposures that result in 
fatality or injury to any person, or result in occupational illness of 
a railroad employee.  
   
14  Number of accident releases and non-accident releases of 
hazardous material is the unintentional release of a hazardous 
material while in transportation, including loading and unloading 
while in railroad possession that is not caused by derailment, 
collision, or other rail-related accidents.  
 
15  Number of violations resulting from the U.S. FRA or state 
inspections or audits. Violations include any safety-related issue 
including those related to accident reporting, grade-crossing 
signal safety, hazardous material regulations, industrial hygiene, 
motive power and equipment (e.g., freight car safety, locomotive 
safety, and passenger equipment safety), railroad operating 
practices (e.g., alcohol and drug use, hours of service laws, 
communications, and operating practices), signal system safety 
and track safety. Includes violation defects that both did and did 
not result in civil penalties.

motive power and equipment (e.g., freight car safety, locomotive 
safety, and passenger equipment safety), railroad operating 
practices (e.g., alcohol and drug use, hours of services laws, 
communications, and operating practices), signal system safety 
and track safety. Includes violation defects that both did and did 
not result in civil penalties.     
  
17  In order for reported data to more accurately reflect active, 
counts will no longer include union employees that have 
unavailable to work for more than three months. The change 
is effective first quarter 2022, however, we have included the 
adjusted count to reflect our employees as of December 31, 2021 
in addition to the standard calculation we have used previously to 
provide consistent counts YoY as well.    
   
18  Diverse workforce is defined by CSX as males of color and all 
females.      
 19  Data mirrors the annual submission to the U.S. Equal Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) and reflects CSX's workforce demographics 
at a specific period in time (December 15, 2021 thru December 31, 
2021). The EEOC report uses mandated job categories which may 
differ from how CSX classifies its workforce elsewhere in  
this report.     
20  Inquiries handled by PSCC, CSX’s contact hub for non-
emergency issues. In 2021, we made changes to our tracking 
process and now track the total amount of incidents handled. 
      
21  Note: Scope 1 emissions exclude 6,000 metric tons of direct CO2e 
emissions from the use of biofuels. 
 
22  GHG emissions intensity in line with science based target goal set 
in 2020. A gross ton mile (GTM) represents the movement of one 
ton of train weight one mile. GTMs are calculated by multiplying 
total train weight by the distance the train moved.  
 
23  Reduction of GHG emissions based on 2014 value of 12.1 metric 
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per MGTM.   
  
24  Revenue ton mile (RTM) is calculated by multiplying the miles 
traveled on each leg by the number of tons of revenue traffic 
carried on that leg.
